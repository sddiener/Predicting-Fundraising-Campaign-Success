<h3>Our Story</h3>
<h3>On Tuesday night, February 28th,  Satchel's Pizza caught fire.   As soon as we saw smoke, we got everyone out of the building and called 911.  The fire department arrived and spent hours hacking at the roof and looking for the fire.  The ceiling in the kitchen has been vaulted so the fire was just creeping around in small cavities looking for air.  The firefighters found the fire. They pumped water in the walls. They saved the place from burning to the ground.  A big thanks to the folks who fought our fire.  Gainesville Fire Department rules! </h3>
<p>This event leaves approximately 50 people unemployed until repairs can be done.  Unemployment compensation pays a fraction of folks wages.  Employees have house payments and kids to support.  We've created this forum for folks to contribute to help the employees pay their bills while we put the kitchen and roof back in order. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You have bills.  You know the deal.  If you lost your job tomorrow, how would you pay the rent?  The community is going nuts wanting to help us. ""What can we do?""  ""How can we help?""  This is a very real way you can show your support for our pizzeria and for the folks who make it happen every day. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We plan to take the last few months of employee income data and distribute any funds we receive in the same manner to the employees. The more you made at Satchel's, the more you will make from this campaign.  if we reach our goal we pay 4% to this site via their guidelines. if we do not reach our goal we pay 9%.  100% of all funds not going to Indie Go Go will go to employees. If you give MORE than our goal, then more money gets to those who work at Satchel's.  Our payroll is about $27,000 every 2 weeks.  We don't know how long we will be closed but we know we will work hard to open as soon as we can. </p>
<p>Check out the perks for donating.  We will have to get creative on how we give away the rewards so we don't get swamped on day 1.   If you donate we will contact you with a time frame for when you can cash in your reward. We are thinking that we will give out rewards to a certain number of people per week so we aren't overwhelmed.  If you can't make it in that week we will work with you.  We are just a local family business after all. </p>

<h2>Please help us keep this free service funded for families across the world!</h2>
<p>As an alternative to long hours away from home and expensive daycares, we support those who wish to bring their careers home. Work-at-home moms and dads have made a selfless choice to earn a smaller salary for double the workload, in exchange for the freedom to be able to put their families first, while still being able to provide for them. The volunteer staff members of Our Milk Money work tirelessly and passionately for this incredible movement!</p>
<h2>What is OurMilkMoney.com?</h2>
<h3>Our Milk Money is a not-for-profit organization that lists the products and services of thousands of family owned businesses across the country.</h3>

By using our consumer power to make purchases from one another, we support our choice to put our family before our career.<br/>Our institutional ethos is built around a common goal to provide for our children. In this society, the average family is faced with a challenge to provide for their families with no less than two incomes. The Parents of the Our Milk Money Organization (Pommos) are making sacrifices, leaving their large corporate salaries and making a commitment to raising their own children. <br/>Through the unity that Our Milk Money provides, we are able to reinvent ourselves as parents and entrepreneurs, adequately embrace our family values, and support one another by working towards a lasting solution. Our rationale is based on a concept that brings the community of self-employed parents together: By purchasing each other's products and services and by promoting our unity as an organization, we are working together towards a vibrant change in the choices we make as consumers. It is up to us to fully appreciate the VALUE of who we choose to purchase from.

<h2>What have we achieved so far?</h2>
<h3>
<br/><em>The OurMilkMoney.com search directory began with an idea based on one mom's own experiences.</em>
</h3>
<p>As not to deprive my children of my daily presence, I searched for a solution that would allow me to replace my corporate salary by earning a revenue working from home. Fortunately, living in the superior age of technology has created more and more opportunity for this ambition. I realized that by uniting with other parents who felt the same way, and utilizing our powers as consumers TOGETHER,  we would be able to create more opportunities for ourselves as parents and as entrepreneurs. <br/>As I began to explore these visions and shape them into a solution, I decided to do a bit of research. I was curious as to how others felt about the situation and whether or not there was a real need for what I wanted to put into motion. The response to my idea was astounding. Hundreds of letters from self-employed parents came flooding in from across the country asking how to get involved, where to sign up, and what could be done to ensure OurMilkMoney.com’s success. I was overwrought not only with the enormity of the responses, but the blatant urgency that came with each inquiry. I discovered how much people needed to believe in this prototype, and how it gave them a new perspective of hope. Complete strangers were informing me of their own personal struggles and of what the success of OurMilkMoney.com might mean for their families.</p>
<h3>
<br/><em>""I knew that OurMilkMoney.com needed to succeed, and I have known it every day since.""</em>
</h3>
<p><br/><strong>OurMilkMoney.com began to grow with it's first goal:</strong> To help parents see that they DO have a choice, and that they are not alone in wanting more for their children. Our Milk Money would become a tool to help parents find financial opportunities and support.<br/><strong>The second goal for OurMilkMoney.com:</strong> To educate the average consumer on the value of purchasing from a self-employed parent, as well as to provide the consumer with an effortless way of accessing the businesses just as efficiently as conducting any online search.<br/><strong>The third and final goal in reaching that destination:</strong> We aim to empower one another, set a good example by purchasing each other’s products and services, and pass our funds back and forth in our own mini-economy. By making a commitment to one another, we knew that others would see the benefit and want to be a part of our community.</p>

<h2>Why do we need your contribution?</h2>
<p><br/>It was important to us that we encompass certain aspects in our site that provide an overall sense of trust and support. We originally charged an annual membership fee but decided it was working against our true integrity and desire to support parents. We have discussed obtaining financing through advertising dollars from larger companies -- but that still seems contradictory to our mission. Clearly, the companies that can afford those kinds of ads don’t need our help to advertise their products or services. The self-employed parents, with low advertising budgets do, which is the function of the Our Milk Money business search engine. Because our site needs basic funds in order to simply stay operational, we are accepting donations from anyone who wishes to contribute. We are in the process of researching private funding and grants as well as affiliate programming and partnerships.  Because we are successful in attracting a good amount of traffic by consumers, members see the value in joining our community.</p>
<p>Currently, the site is earning just enough to maintain itself, but not enough to grow. Since it does not earn a profit, we rely on the volunteers that contribute their time, energy and expertise into keeping the site fully functional. The staff members are stay-at-home moms who work tirelessly to keep the business directory afloat. Its time for us to give back to these altruistic volunteers by paying them $50 a month for their heart, their passion and their time. In addition, these extra funds will allow us to pay for much needed upgrades to the site, stay fully functional and exposed through social media outlets, as well as use cutting-edge technology to promote the self-employed parents listed in the business directory.</p>

<h3><font color=""#000066"" size=""3""><u>Our Story</u></font></h3>
<p><font color=""#000000"" size=""3"">We (Nicole Brennan and Megan Moss) are first year university students at The University of Western Ontario. We have always enjoyed volunteering with children and decided we would like to contribute to a community less fortunate than our own. That is why we are going to South Africa on May 6th, 2012 for 2 weeks, to volunteer in an orphanage through an organization called International Volunteer HQ. As previously mentioned, we are university students with limited funds. This is why we need your help so that we can help others. Any donations are greatly appreciated. </font></p>
<p><br/><font size=""3""></font></p>
</div><div>
<h3><font color=""#cc0000"" size=""3""><u>The Impact</u></font></h3>
<p><font size=""3""><font color=""#000000""><font>
Some of the children we will be working with have lost their
parents to crime, alcohol, drug abuse and HIV/Aids, which means the children
have to live with relatives or neighbours who sometimes do not take proper care
of the children. By volunteering at the orphanage, we will be taking proper
care of these children that have difficult pasts and minimal personal
relationships. Without our help, the orphanage would not be capable of taking
on as many children because they would not be able to afford the workers.
Consequently, many children would be left alone or in the care of under
qualified guardians which often leads children down the wrong path later in
life due to insufficient guidance and care.</font></font></font></p><p></p><p></p>

<h3><font color=""#003300"" size=""3""><u>What We Need &amp; What You Get</u></font></h3>
<p><font color=""#000000"" size=""3"">In order to volunteer at the orphanage in South Africa, we will need approximately $2500. The breakdown or this price is as follows:</font></p>
<p><font color=""#000000"" size=""3"">- <em>$230 for registration fees</em> - this includes 24/7 support from IVHQ staff, program marketing costs, information pack, administration costs, travel costs to inspect programs and communication costs with volunteers. </font></p>

</div></div>","Our Story
We (Nicole Brennan and Megan Moss) are first year university students at The University of Western Ontario. We have always enjoyed volunteering with children and decided we would like to contribute to a community less fortunate than our own. That is why we are going to South Africa on May 6th, 2012 for 2 weeks, to volunteer in an orphanage through an organization called International Volunteer HQ. As previously mentioned, we are university students with limited funds. This is why we need your help so that we can help others. Any donations are greatly appreciated. 


The Impact

Some of the children we will be working with have lost their
parents to crime, alcohol, drug abuse and HIV/Aids, which means the children
have to live with relatives or neighbours who sometimes do not take proper care
of the children. By volunteering at the orphanage, we will be taking proper
care of these children that have difficult pasts and minimal personal
relationships. Without our help, the orphanage would not be capable of taking
on as many children because they would not be able to afford the workers.
Consequently, many children would be left alone or in the care of under
qualified guardians which often leads children down the wrong path later in
life due to insufficient guidance and care.




What We Need & What You Get
In order to volunteer at the orphanage in South Africa, we will need approximately $2500. The breakdown or this price is as follows:
- $230 for registration fees - this includes 24/7 support from IVHQ staff, program marketing costs, information pack, administration costs, travel costs to inspect programs and communication costs with volunteers. 
 - $600 for the 2 week volunteer program - this includes Airport pick up, orientation, program supervision, accommodation and meals during volunteer placement period, In-country 24/7 support and In-country administration costs.
 
- $1500 (approx.) for a round trip flight 
 
- $170 (estimated) for additional costs - this includes travel insurance, vaccinations, police checks, transportation while there
 
* Any additional funds will go towards supplies for the children such as books, arts and crafts, toys, etc.

<p><strong>My Story</strong></p>
<p>In about one month, I will embark on a journey to Nairobi, Kenya, where I will spend the coming three months as a Kiva Fellow. Kiva is a non-profit organization with a mission to alleviate poverty. They are helping low-income entrepreneurs, who lack access to traditional banking systems, to get access to capital and work their way out of poverty through micro lending.</p>
<p>The first time I heard about Kiva was during my Economic Development studies, when writing my Master Thesis about how microfinance targeted towards women can lead to higher gender equality. I was instantly amazed by the brilliant idea that Kiva was built on and in January this year I made my first loan on the Kiva website (<a href=""http://www.kiva.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.kiva.org</a>). Now, nine months later I have been accepted to the Kiva Fellows Program to help increase Kivas impact around the world and I could not be more excited.</p>
<p>During my stay in Kenya I will be working with the two newest and most innovative aspects of Kiva’s model – non traditional partners and Kiva Zip. Kiva Zip is testing new ways and techniques with the goal of expanding their reach to unserved populations and drive down the cost for the borrower. My main task at the two non-traditional field partners (Brazafric and Honey care) will be to help them implement sustainable and efficient Kiva processes.</p>
<p><strong>Where you come in</strong></p>
<p>The Kiva Fellow is an<strong> unpaid, volunteer position</strong> designed to increase Kiva's impact and to offer participants a unique insider experience in the world of microfinance. With a little bit of your support, together we can help to make an impact.</p>
<p>I will be extremely happy and thankful for all the help I can get. I have calculated that my Fellowship will cost approximately $6000 dollars with airfare, accommodation, Visa, immunization and travels within the country to meet with borrowers. Any amount you can contribute will be influential.</p>
<p><strong>If you can’t contribute, don’t worry, there are other ways to help.</strong></p>
<p>First of all you can go to Kivas website <a href=""http://www.kiva.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.kiva.org</a>, and spread the word about the organisation You can scroll through the entrepreneurs and their profiles, and help these people to create a better life for themselves and their families, through a loan as small as $25.

As a thalassemia minor, Rajvi has a low level of iron in her blood and thus, hearing about the <strong>millions</strong> of people in India (75% of the Indian population) that were suffering from anemia just as she did, made her think of what she could do. So as a college junior, she started Let's Be Well RED, an initiative that makes <strong>iron-rich nutritional bars</strong> and works with high school students to spread awareness about this important condition that deprives the body of energy, hindering any kind of mental or physical activity. Because GudNeSs, our nutritional bar, provides children with the daily necessary amount of iron to be healthy in a natural way, we can help children with a nutritional supplement that will help them have enough energy to concentrate in class or play with their friends. Without a natural source of iron, parts of our body is deprived of oxygen!!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In the past year, we have come up with a nutritious, yummy and affordable nutritional bar, sold over 30,000 bars and have recruited 96 high school students in Mumbai that talk to other students in other schools about iron deficiency anemia. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We have received great support from different schools in Mumbai and the demand for the bars just keeps going up! However, we now have one issue: our production cannot keep up with the demand. We have received demands from single customers of up to 20,000 bars per month and currently, we can only make 5,000 bars per day. Additionally, as we continue to work in Mumbai, we now have other college volunteers working in the state of Gujarat too, making our demand even larger.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>However, Rajvi's dream is to combat anemia and be able to make the solution available to everyone in India. The more bars we produce, the more we can subsidize and the more lives we can save from anemia.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The solution? Expand our production. We need a new packaging machine and a new production machine that will help us produce more bars in India. The production machine will help us produce 25,000 bars per day and the packaging machine will help us package 15,200 bars per day. So with these two machines we'll be able to help up to 7 times more people than before!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If we are able to produce more bars, we'll be able to help more anemic children and as result improving their lifestyle. We'll be able to help them be healthy enough to play with friends, finish high school and we'll be able to help other anemic family members <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">all over India</span> have enough energy to provide for them. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>This machinery is however very expensive, the packaging machine costing $10,000 and the production machine $8,000, but any contribution to our cause is huge. Any amount can help us get much closer to our dream. </div>

<h2 align=""CENTER"">Why YOU are here?</h2>
<p>Things kicked off for our team in March when we launched our first project, <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/carecropping"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Seeds That Feed</a>, and introduced our CareCropping program to Fayetteville, Arkansas. With a handful of amazing people and $50 in seed funding, we were able to witness firsthand the power of an idea mixed with a sense of purpose and executed with passion through action. To date, we have <a href=""http://www.freeweekly.com/2012/08/30/seed-plant-feed/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">collected and distributed</a> over 16,000 pounds of fresh produce to local food pantries and meal programs in a community in which <a href=""http://www.arhungeralliance.org/pdf/HUNGER%20IN%20THE%20LAND%20OF%20PLENTY.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">37% of our food insecure are children</a>.</p>
<p><br/>Today we present to you our second project, <a href=""http://bit.ly/SaVgTP"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SpareTime</a>. Much like Seeds That Feed, SpareTime started as an idea mixed with a sense of purpose and executed with passion through action. This past August, SpareTime was selected out of 83 applications globally to participate in the <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/08/the-ark-challenge-demo-day/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ARK Challenge</a>*. This 14 week intensive, <a href=""http://arkchallenge.org/mentors/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">mentorship</a>-driven bootcamp for technology startups was meant to put our idea to the test. In the past 3 months, we have sat across from <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Running-Lean-Iterate-Plan-Works/dp/1449305172/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1353336613&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=ash+maurya"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">authors</a>, CEOs, CTOs, Directors of all sorts, highly successful entrepreneurs and seasoned investors—all with one topic of discussion, SpareTime.</p>
<p><br/>It has been an amazing ride—one filled with 12 hour workdays and many sleepless nights. A ride that has surrounded us with some of the most successful people we will ever have the opportunity to meet and first class mentorship from some of the brightest minds we will ever have the privilege of knowing. A ride that has taken us into the offices of university officials and corporate leaders, put us face to face with <a href=""http://www.rootsandshoots.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dr. Jane Goodall</a>, and connected us with amazing individuals like <a href=""http://www.amandarose.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Amanda Rose</a>, <a href=""http://arkchallenge.org/portfolio/phoebe-espiritu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Phoebe Espiritu</a>, and <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/person/binh-tran"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Binh Tran.</a> Lastly, it is a ride that has taken us to Crystal Bridges Museum of Art where we presented to over 200 potential investors and <a href=""http://governor.arkansas.gov/governor/Pages/default.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe.</a> More importantly, it is a ride that places us here in front YOU.</p>
<p><br/>So, here we are 14 weeks later with an idea that has come to fruition in the form of a validated platform for <em>advancing social good</em>.</p>
<p><br/>SpareTime is meant for the community and this means it must pass one more test—that of the community at large. We know that we have the support of our family members, close friends, and even our mentors. However, beyond our inner circle is a community. We built SpareTime to serve the community and that includes every individual that has reached this page. Today, we seek your support in any shape or form you feel you can provide, whether that be a simple <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/sparetimeinc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook Like or Share</a>, <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/gosparetime"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">a follow or tweet</a>, or your generous support through funding.   </p>

<p>In 2005, while working together at a local restaurant and attending the Walton College of Business, we began our partnership working side by side in a competitive environment. During this time, not only did we find a way to work collaboratively for both of our best interests, but we also laid the foundation of trust that has sustained us since. Our friendship continued to be cultivated because of our common interests, passions, and drive to make a difference.</p>
<p>Beginning again in 2009, our working relationship was rekindled upon the idea of SpareTime and our partnership was formed. While working full time jobs and further developing our concept for SpareTime, we launched Seeds that Feed and continue to watch it grow beyond our wildest expectations!</p>

<p>Aron Shelton is the Architect and Visionary of SpareTime–generator of new ideas, surveyor of the competitive landscape, and researcher who shapes and defines our position in the marketplace.</p>
<p>Alyssa Snyder is the Director and Marketer behind SpareTime–business and customer developer, scaler and analyzer of new ideas, organizer and strategic planner, and protector of our concept and user experience.</p>

DEMO-DAY PITCH @ CRYSTAL BRIDGES

THANKS FOR THE SUPPORT!


Why YOU are here?
Things kicked off for our team in March when we launched our first project, Seeds That Feed, and introduced our CareCropping program to Fayetteville, Arkansas. With a handful of amazing people and $50 in seed funding, we were able to witness firsthand the power of an idea mixed with a sense of purpose and executed with passion through action. To date, we have collected and distributed over 16,000 pounds of fresh produce to local food pantries and meal programs in a community in which 37% of our food insecure are children.
Today we present to you our second project, SpareTime. Much like Seeds That Feed, SpareTime started as an idea mixed with a sense of purpose and executed with passion through action. This past August, SpareTime was selected out of 83 applications globally to participate in the ARK Challenge*. This 14 week intensive, mentorship-driven bootcamp for technology startups was meant to put our idea to the test. In the past 3 months, we have sat across from authors, CEOs, CTOs, Directors of all sorts, highly successful entrepreneurs and seasoned investors—all with one topic of discussion, SpareTime.
It has been an amazing ride—one filled with 12 hour workdays and many sleepless nights. A ride that has surrounded us with some of the most successful people we will ever have the opportunity to meet and first class mentorship from some of the brightest minds we will ever have the privilege of knowing. A ride that has taken us into the offices of university officials and corporate leaders, put us face to face with Dr. Jane Goodall, and connected us with amazing individuals like Amanda Rose, Phoebe Espiritu, and Binh Tran. Lastly, it is a ride that has taken us to Crystal Bridges Museum of Art where we presented to over 200 potential investors and Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe. More importantly, it is a ride that places us here in front YOU.
So, here we are 14 weeks later with an idea that has come to fruition in the form of a validated platform for advancing social good.
SpareTime is meant for the community and this means it must pass one more test—that of the community at large. We know that we have the support of our family members, close friends, and even our mentors. However, beyond our inner circle is a community. We built SpareTime to serve the community and that includes every individual that has reached this page. Today, we seek your support in any shape or form you feel you can provide, whether that be a simple Facebook Like or Share, a follow or tweet, or your generous support through funding.

About us
ARK Challenge Team video
In 2005, while working together at a local restaurant and attending the Walton College of Business, we began our partnership working side by side in a competitive environment. During this time, not only did we find a way to work collaboratively for both of our best interests, but we also laid the foundation of trust that has sustained us since. Our friendship continued to be cultivated because of our common interests, passions, and drive to make a difference.
Beginning again in 2009, our working relationship was rekindled upon the idea of SpareTime and our partnership was formed. While working full time jobs and further developing our concept for SpareTime, we launched Seeds that Feed and continue to watch it grow beyond our wildest expectations!
 

Aron Shelton is the Architect and Visionary of SpareTime–generator of new ideas, surveyor of the competitive landscape, and researcher who shapes and defines our position in the marketplace.
Alyssa Snyder is the Director and Marketer behind SpareTime–business and customer developer, scaler and analyzer of new ideas, organizer and strategic planner, and protector of our concept and user experience.

<h3><strong><em>READ ABOUT BOOKS FOR SOLDIERS IN PEOPLE MAGAZINE</em><br/></strong></h3>
<a href=""http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20617006,00.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20617006,00.html</a>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>HOW IT STARTED</strong></h3>
<p>During the first Gulf War, several of my friends from school were in the reserves and were activated to fight the Iraqis. CNN reported that once the soldiers were deployed, they were faced with massive downtime and were restricted to their base due to the travel limitations set by the Saudi government.</p>
<p>I am a voracious reader and at the beginning of the Gulf War, I had a closet full of paperback books. Books that were not being used. So instead of selling them at the used book store, I packed them up in small care packages and sent them out to all the soldiers, sailors, marines and airmen I had addresses for.</p>
<p>Within a few weeks, I ran out of books before I ran out of addresses. Friends and family members began donating their paperback books and in the end I sent over 1000 books to the Gulf.</p>
<p>After the war, I received many thank-you notes from soldiers who got one of my books. Unless it was time for them to fly back home, mail-call days were one of the most anticipated events of deployment.</p>
<p>After September 11, I knew I wanted to do the same thing but I needed to develop a self-serve website. I couldn't do it all myself and BooksForSoldiers.com was born.</p>
<p>Regardless of why the military is deployed, the men and women of our armed services are there for us. They deserve our support and if we can make their deployment easier, then all the better.</p>
<h3><strong>OUR IMPACT</strong></h3>
<p>Last year we shipped over $2.7 million dollars in care packages (books, DVDs, music CDs, video games, tube socks, etc) to deployed US troops and to soldiers in military hospitals across the world and here in the US. Not too bad with an annual budget of $120,000.</p>
<p>A book can help with the long hours of down time and help take the soldier's mind off the horrors of war. We have had a few letters from troops crediting the books we shipped them as saving their lives and preventing some suicides.</p>
<p>BFS has all the problems of a dot com startup and a national charity. It is a 100% volunteer organization - no one gets a salary. Funds are used to pay for our datacenter fees, insurance, used books, DVDs, video games, postage, computers, software and a number of other things that tend to add up over the year.</p>
<p>BFS has been in continious operation since March 1, 2003 and we have been shipping ever since.</p>

<h2>Our History:</h2>
<p> </p>
<p> We are a small town Cafe in Pennsylvania. We offer the best espresso based drinks available and a great menu of baked goods, N.Y. Bagels, and extensive sandwiches. We are very much like a small, friendly Panera Bread with a personal touch. We have grown significantly in our second year. My wife and I have invested our life savings in this business. We have quickly become a pilar in the community, and have grown in double digits since our inception. We currently operate with 1-3 employees and family. We are open seven days and have WOWED every person we have encountered!.</p>
<h2>Our Commitment:</h2>
<p> We have invested over 100,000 dollars in remodeling, build out, and improvements since opening. We are open seven days and oversee every aspect of operations. One of us are here at 5:30 every morning and at 9:00 p.m. every night. We are anchored here in the community, My wife is an elementary teacher at our local school, and all three of our children attend the school district. We are involved in Academics, Athletics, and mant extra-curricular activities. We have lived in this town for almost 18 years. All three of our children work within the business at least one-two days a week, and in the summer a bit more. We are commited to providing our customers a top notch experience whether it is just a cup of our fresh roasted coffee, or one of our inviting sandwiches. We have brought the Starbucks selection and variety to the small town.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Our Establishment: Not Just A Bean Cafe &amp; Roastery</h2>
<p> We offer our customers the following:</p>
<p>1. Fresh roasted coffee, Espresso, Lattes, and cappuccinos.</p>
<p>2. Made to order Paninis, soups, salads, and baked goods</p>
<p>3. Fresh Baked N.Y. Bagels with an assortment of homemade spreads, and cream cheeses.</p>
<p>4. Roast to order Coffee, bagged and sealed on premise.</p>
<p>5. A complete line of Smoothies, and frozen coffee drinks (coffee free versions for the non coffee lovers).</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Our Pitch:</h2>
<p> We need to raise 30,000 in capital to purchase our existing space and make a few equipment upgrades to better handle our steady increase in volume. Our lease is up and we are going to be faced with higher rent. There are two other income producing properties on premise and that income would go to us after our purchase. Our rent would then be zero due to the fact that the existing rent is already in excess of the mortgage. The current owner has agreed to finance the building for us at 4%. We have been here almost two years and have achieved steady growth. we have already invested over 100,000 to date and cannot easily obtain the down payment without resorting to high interest debt, which I will not resort to. This little shop is a winner and could easily be replicated in small towns accross the country.</p>

3. Fresh Baked N.Y. Bagels with an assortment of homemade spreads, and cream cheeses.
4. Roast to order Coffee, bagged and sealed on premise.
5. A complete line of Smoothies, and frozen coffee drinks (coffee free versions for the non coffee lovers).
 
Our Pitch:
 We need to raise 30,000 in capital to purchase our existing space and make a few equipment upgrades to better handle our steady increase in volume. Our lease is up and we are going to be faced with higher rent. There are two other income producing properties on premise and that income would go to us after our purchase. Our rent would then be zero due to the fact that the existing rent is already in excess of the mortgage. The current owner has agreed to finance the building for us at 4%. We have been here almost two years and have achieved steady growth. we have already invested over 100,000 to date and cannot easily obtain the down payment without resorting to high interest debt, which I will not resort to. This little shop is a winner and could easily be replicated in small towns accross the country.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>
<h3>Who I Am</h3>
<p>Name is Caleb Snell and I have been building and upgrading computers since I was 10. Recently I just amassed enough money to build a nice gaming computer and it runs anything I could want it to. Until recently when I wanted to start doing Youtube Commentaries. </p>
<p>This campeign is designed so that I can raise money to upgrade my computer so I can create commentaries. For a while now i have wanted to do it, but I could never get my computer to run it. Not only can my computer not run Fraps and games without showing significant amounts of lag, my hard drive also fills very fast. This is the reason I need the upgrade for my comptuer. </p>
<p>If I end up raising anywhere near or even half of my goal this would be of tremendous help to me. As I am 14, and the field that I would like to work in, it is hard to find a job for me. Any money that I could get would bring me closer to my goal making Youtube commentaries. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How much money I need, and what you get in return. </h3>
<p>To meet my goal of getting all of the upgrades for my computer I need exactly one thousand dollars. All of the money that I receive will be going towards my computer so that I can make the commentairies. </p>
<p>The first level for donations is something that everyone will get if they donated at all. You will get your name in all of my Youtube videos, or any other name you wish to put in there. </p>
<p>The second level for donations is something that everyone will get if they donated twenty-five or more dollars. You will get a dedicated video to you. You will also receive your name in my youtube videos. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know how the difference their contribution will make:</p>
<p>If I end up making all the money and are able to give my computer an upgrade, it would allow to me give commentaries and tutorials on youtube for people who are new. I am doing this because I knew how I started off on battlefield 3, which was pretty rough. Having tutorials is really helpful with battlefield 3.</p>

<h3>The MeSoap Story</h3>
<p>Howdy! We're Mike and Garth, and we've co-founded MeSoap.</p>
<p>Every day 5000 children die needless deaths due to the lack of proper sanitation and clean water. This must stop. In response to these staggering numbers, we developed MeSoap — to bring life to communities that lack basic necessities by creating a company focused on giving back. For every bar or bottle of our organic soap purchased we donate a bar or its equivalent to children in need. Learn how, where, and more details about how we give at <a href=""http://bit.ly/nsno7c"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://bit.ly/nsno7c</a>.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>We are looking to raise $6500 to help us in producing our new liquid hand soap, as well as, some annual operational expenses.

<p>You can help on several levels — we've got rewards: bar soap, liquid soap, special thank yous, hand-written notes, and framed pictures of us handing out the soap that was a result of your contribution.

Story
""Muslims definitely have a responsibility to our
society, wherever we find ourselves.""
- Imam Zaid Shakir

to the basic teachings of Islam and programs that benefit the local community.
One of these programs, the Community Feeding Program, brings
Muslims together every Saturday morning to distribute groceries and provide hot, Halal meals to over 200
low-income and homeless people each week. 
$8,000
of funds raised will sustain the Community Feeding Program for an entire year.
$10,000 will help Lighthouse Mosque with the new renovation &
general expenses. 

It's been a busy year for Lighthouse! Check out this year's programs & projects:Lighthouse Mosque is currently under renovation to accommodate more people for prayer & events: removing the kitchen,

prayer spaceInvest in the
educational & social experience of muslims within our community

Your
generosity can reap infinite amounts of reward for you and provide sorely
needed help to the greater community.
Testimony from Community Feeding Recipient:
""I’ve been coming here for the past 3 1/2 years.
Ever since he [my son] was born, this is the way that I’m able to feed my
family... because money does run out... All the staff here are just heaven
sent, they really are. We have prayer with them even though we have two
different faiths. God is God, it doesn’t matter. It is so beautiful; they pray,
they bring in community speakers, they’re activists and they’re here to help us.""
 
A message from Imam Abdul Latif:
""Muslims cannot adequately bear the test of time in the
United States without being organized. The Lighthouse Mosque has taken on the specific task
of education and community activism.  Supporting such a cause is a practical
undertaking of doing one's part in the grand scheme of this massive event
termed 'American Islam.'""

Why we need your help
          Lupus patients spend an average of $13,735 - $27,531 on medical care compared to $7,794 - $9,788 spent by those without Lupus.

Two of three Lupus patients reported a complete or partial loss of their income because they no longer are able to work fulltime due to complications of Lupus.
 
Symptoms of Lupus      

The most common symptoms of lupus, which are the same for females and males, are:

extreme fatigue (tiredness)
headaches
painful or swollen joints
fever
anemia (low numbers of red blood cells or hemoglobin, or low total blood volume)
swelling (edema) in feet, legs, hands, and/or around eyes
pain in chest on deep breathing (pleurisy)
butterfly-shaped rash across cheeks and nose
sun- or light-sensitivity (photosensitivity)
hair loss
abnormal blood clotting
fingers turning white and/or blue when cold (Raynaud’s phenomenon)mouth or nose ulcers

Many of these symptoms occur in other illnesses besides lupus. In fact, lupus is sometimes called ""the great imitator"" because its symptoms are often like the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, blood disorders, fibromyalgia, diabetes, thyroid problems, Lyme disease, and a number of heart, lung, muscle, and bone diseases.

I'm asking for the support of my family, friends and anyone else inspired by my story to make this work possible. La Cocina provides these women with </i></i><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">cheap kitchen rental, and what is essentially an intense food MBA to
help them transition from an informal home business to a fully-fledged, legal
food business. Our aim is to empower the women to move from an income patching
casual job to an asset generating business where they are in control, where
they feel empowered and can genuinely make a difference in their lives and
their families as well.</i></p>
<h3><b>About me</b></h3>
<p>I’m a social enterprise and food enthusiast; and believe
that a mix of the two is even better! I’m currently doing
my undergraduate at the University of Bath, and studying here has allowed me to
go on a journey exploring the social sector. It has shown me that it is
possible to make money and do good in the world, and that the two don’t need to
be mutually exclusive. The people I’ve met and worked with along this journey
have spurred my interest and belief in the fact that education, empowerment, collaboration,
and the power of communities can go a long way to changing the world for the
better. And my work for La Cocina in San Francisco will carry on this inspiring
journey.</p>
<h3><b>About the internship</b></h3>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">At La Cocina, I will help build out

<br/><p></p></div>","From February 2014 to August 2014, I'll be traveling nearly halfway around the world to work with La Cocina a not-for-profit organisation which helps women from low income and immigrant communities who run informal food businesses from their homes, where I will be building the existing curriculum and conducting market research to make it easier for these women to set up brick-and-mortar food businesses. I'm asking for the support of my family, friends and anyone else inspired by my story to make this work possible. La Cocina provides these women with cheap kitchen rental, and what is essentially an intense food MBA to
help them transition from an informal home business to a fully-fledged, legal
food business. Our aim is to empower the women to move from an income patching
casual job to an asset generating business where they are in control, where
they feel empowered and can genuinely make a difference in their lives and
their families as well.
About me
I’m a social enterprise and food enthusiast; and believe
that a mix of the two is even better! I’m currently doing
my undergraduate at the University of Bath, and studying here has allowed me to
go on a journey exploring the social sector. It has shown me that it is
possible to make money and do good in the world, and that the two don’t need to
be mutually exclusive. The people I’ve met and worked with along this journey
have spurred my interest and belief in the fact that education, empowerment, collaboration,
and the power of communities can go a long way to changing the world for the
better. And my work for La Cocina in San Francisco will carry on this inspiring
journey.
About the internship
At La Cocina, I will help build out
their bespoke incubation curriculum. This'll include developing materials for
new innovative teaching modules, with a focus on cooperative building. I will
also be conducting market research on the Urban Real Estate sector in San
Francisco, with a focus on innovative “maker-spaces” (community-operated
workspaces where people with common interest can work from, socialise &
build their business). This'll be a critical element of La Cocina’s strategic
growth initiative around creating low capital brick & mortar retail
opportunities in San Francisco for the women, as this is something that is
currently very capital intensive.By working at La Cocina, I hope to gain insights, from a grass routes level, into how we can use the power of food and community to create lasting social change. I would love to, one day, be able to leverage these learnings to have a start-up of my own working at the intersection of food and social enterprise.

<h4>Stopping a Nosebleed</h4>
<p>Until now, when nosebleeds occur, there hasn't been an easy, quick way to stop the blood flow. Most people simply stick some tissue up their nose and tilt their head back...and wait...and wait...and wait. </p>
<p>Pharmacist, and founder of ByzMed, LLC, Greg Dockter is one of the many people out there that suffers from frequent nosebleeds. That, coupled with the fact that when he had a patient develop a nosebleed in his pharmacy and the best solution he could offer was a tissue, prompted him to develop his own nosebleed relief product.</p>
<p>DrxNoze® Nosebleed Relief is the result of years of research and work. The one-time use applicator applies a topical gel to the problem area and the bleeding stops, typically in a minute, allowing you to return to your activities quickly. A box contains five ready-to-use applications. The all natural active ingredients are safe for adults and children over the age of 6. (Please read instructions with purchase.)</p>
<p>This is a must-have for people who are most likely to get nosebleeds, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>People involved in athletics (boxing, wrestling, hockey, football, etc.)</li>
<li>People on blood thinning agents (warfarin, aspirin, etc.)</li>
<li>People involved in cold weather and high altitude activities</li>
<li>People with allergies</li>
<li>People using nasal steroids</li>
<li>People that live in a dry climate</li>
<li>People with hypertension (high blood pressure)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, schools and organizations, households with active children, and any group that has a medical/first-aid kit on premises, could benefit from having DrxNoze Nosebleed Relief on hand.</p>
<p><b></b> </p>
<h4>How does this product work?</h4>
<p>DrxNoze Nosebleed Relief is a combination of patented natural ingredients that assist the body in its natural blood clotting process. It contains ingredients that will make the blood clot faster and ingredients that will balance the mucus production of the nasal <br/>membrane.</p>
<p><b></b> </p>
<h4>Ready for production</h4>
<p>DrxNoze Nosebleed Relief has been formulated with the assistance of the University of Wisconsin-Pharmacy School’s Lenor Zeeh Pharmaceutical Experimentation Station. The proper natural ingredients, ones that will not interact with medication or health conditions, were researched and chosen. The DrxNoze Nosebleed Relief formulation has been patented, has met all FDA requirements, package design has been developed and the only thing left is to go into production. We've contracted with an FDA inspected facility that follows all GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) guidelines to produce and package the product for distribution. </p>
<p>Your contribution will help us fund the final stability trials, produce the packaging and help us get our product out to the public. Final product is on a timeline for shipping in December of 2013.</p>

We're planning to hand-deliver our 83,000-strong petition right to the McDonald's global executives in the US.
Imagine two locals turning up on the doorstep of the HQ in Chicago. A giant printout of the petition and a clear message with them for Macca's global executives: Stop targeting our kids -- don't build your store opposite the kindergarten in Tecoma!
It'll cost a couple of thousand dollars to get us there and back including return airfares, accommodation for one night, taxi fares, and the printing of the petition to hand over to them. 

Can you chip in a few dollars to help us pay for the trip? The Tecoma community is not backing down. And I hope you're with us. If you can, please chip in what you can to help us continue the fight we'd really appreciate it!

<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">Special
Needs Children need childcare also!</h1>
<p>Finding
childcare can be a challenge. Finding childcare for a special need child is downright
impossible. Let’s help special needs parents find childcare and support!</p>
<h2>Childcare
and support for special needs families</h2>
<p>We
created this special needs support campaign to fund the creation of a special
needs childcare support website. To truly help the 3 million parents of special
needs kids find childcare and support, we will build a childcare website
specifically designed for them. The website will be simple, secure, and
intuitive to use. </p>
<h2>Is
there really a need?</h2>
<p>Our
son Jeremy is like the 3 million special needs kids in North America, he needs
an experienced provider when mom and dad are at work, at an appointment, or
going out for the evening. Many of the 3 million special needs parents
currently need immediate help! They are having significant troubles finding
child care providers that can administer medications, are patient with children
completing the simplest of tasks, and who have training in adaptive learning
techniques. While there are many care provider services available, they are
limited to general childcare and do not actually focus on special needs
families.</p>
<h2>Your
donation will make a huge impact!</h2>
<p>The
demand for life-changing special needs support services have been increasing at
an alarming rate! Any services currently available in most neighborhoods are
severely outdated or overwhelmed with requests from parents. Children with
special needs will benefit by having an experienced caregiver that will make a
positive and profound difference in their lives. Parents will have access to
affordable, quality child care that is matched to their needs.Caregivers
will find rewarding job opportunities that match their career field.
</p>
<h2>Where
your donation will go </h2>
<p>Designing
a highly functional website is resource intensive and requires very experienced
staff. </p>
<ul><li>Phase
1 – $800 - We will create a simple website assisting parents and childcare
provider an area to register and find each other.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Phase
2 - $10,000 - Based on three professional estimates, this will require hundreds
of web programming hours to build the automated functionality. This functionality
includes database
search capabilities, member
login sessions, secure message communications, and advanced
job posting and childcare matching notifications.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Phase
3 - $20,000 – Our goal in phase 3 will be to recruit childcare provider experts
to provide support articles, comply with federal and state regulations, and
introduce the service at the next year’s national special needs conferences. </li></ul>
<h2>We
are an experienced management team!</h2>
<p>My
name is Sarah and I have 20 years of experience in Health Care management. My
husband Wayne has been in Information Technology management for over 20 years. We
know what it takes to be successful and help families but we need your help.
With our experience and your generous donation, parents of special needs
children will finally have a childcare website design specifically for the
special needs community. Parents can search for care providers based on
criteria such as distance, schedule, education, certifications, and specific
experience. They will also have access to special needs support information.</p>
<h2>Other
Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>You
can still help our special needs community, even if you are unable to
financially contribute. We respectfully request you share our campaign link to
your friends, family, and coworkers.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We own and operate a small bookstore in Colchester, CT. We primarily carry used books, but also offer shelf space to local authors with new books, and carry a variety of novelty items created by local artists.</p>
<p>Currently, we occupy 700 square feet, and we want to grow! We have about 8,000 books in our shop, and another 8,000 books in storage at our house (there's no storage space at our current location). We hope to move to a bigger location with more visibility to bring more books to more readers.</p>
<p>Owning a bookstore has been our lifelong dream. In 2012, I decided it was now or never, and made the plunge. It's unbelievably wonderful to be happy to go to work each day. Being able to talk about great books, share ideas with aspiring writers, and hook up new readers with incredible authors is a dream come true! If only we could expand, move to a better location, and meet even more readers! This is how you can help. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>There's a location available to us that's in the center of town (we're currently in a fairly rural area) with three times the space. Also, there's storage at the new location, and insulation (something we don't currently have, which leads to astronomical heating bills in the winter). The new space will cost us $25,000 for the year. We'd love to move in tomorrow, but unfortunately, we can't afford it . . . yet!</p>
<p>That's why we're asking for donations. We want to move to a spot with more shelf space and more visibility to attract more readers and offer more previously-loved books. </p>
<p>If we don't meet our goal, all funds raised will go towards improving where we are. The landlord has stated that if we want the shop insulated, we'll have to pay for it. We'll also use the money to increase our advertising to let more people know we're here.</p>
<p>We're offering the following perks:</p>
<p><b>Donate $25</b> and receive a coupon for a free romance novel at the store!</p>
<p><b>Donate $50 </b>and receive a coupon for 20% off all used books in the store!</p>
<p><b>Donate $75 </b>and receive a coupon for a free romance novel, and a book light!</p>
<p><b>Donate $100</b> and receive a coupon for 20% off all used books in the store, and a book light!</p>
<p><b>Donate $1,000 or more</b> and receive a copy of <i>Bite Club</i> by Hal Bodner, a book light, a hand-crafted wooden etched bookmark, and 20% off all used books in the store!</p>
<p><b>Donate $5,000</b> and receive a new (unopened) Nintendo Challenge Set and Super Mario Brothers 3 game cartridge!</p>
<p><b>Donate $10,000</b> and receive a genuine <i>Revenge of the Jedi</i> script! This was the title of the movie before George Lucas changed it to <i>Return of the Jedi</i>. This is a RARE COLLECTOR'S ITEM and only one is available, so act now!</p>
<p>All donors will be recognized on our contributor page of our website.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You have a chance to help an independent bookstore provide more books, education, and a safe place to hang out in the community. Remember that used bookstore you used to visit as a kid, hanging out for hours, getting lost in the stacks? We want to be that place.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that in this economy, some people just can't contribute financially at this time. We're asking these folks to get the word out, via Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, your own personal websites and blogs, or any other way you can think of! Don't forget about Indiegogo's share tools--they make it easier to get the word out to as many people as possible!</p>

<p>The current medical system has gotten too large, confusing, and impossible for most elders to navigate.  Due to pressures on physician ""productivity""  office visits are twenty minutes long and often double booked.  Elders complain that they feel rushed, their questions are not answered nor are their symptoms addressed.  To compensate for the lack of physician time, tests are ordered that they can't afford, medications are prescribed that they often do not need, and because most cannot drive they stop seeking medical care.  Families are also frustrated for the same reasons, especially when they live away from their parents.</p>
<p>I have worked in nursing homes for many years and have seen, on too many occasions, elders who could have avoided hospitalizations if they had better access to care.   We have all been convinced that health care is supposed to be technology driven, confusing by nature and expensive.  We have also been convinced that when people get old they go to nursing homes.  The reality is that most people want to stay at home-and die at home with family, friends and pets-<em>who are often given up to shelters because they can't go with them.</em></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/82574/files/20130918145512-deepsleep.jpg?1379541312"" src="""" style=""width: 262.92px; height: 180px;""/></p>
<p>My campaign is to bring back the practice of Physician House Calls and spread the notion that a ""patient centered medical home"" <em>can</em> and <em>should</em> be in their own home versus a nursing home.  Physicians can better manage complicated medical problems, anticipate and develop plans for acute decline or acute illness and reduce or prevent hospitalizations.  Stress is taken away from families and caregivers because they are part of the care plan.  Elders with Alzheimer's or other dementias are able to stay home longer; caregiver burnout is identified early and treated. Hospice and palliative care can be integrated earlier when appropriate to avoid emotional chaos as elders transition.  Physicians can work more closely with Visiting Nurse agencies as well as other home based service agencies.</p>
<p> All funding goes directly to developing and providing comprehensive in-home care to community dwelling elders.  DASH is independent of large private and hospital based practices.  </p>
<p>We are also developing this as a viable model of health care that more physicians will adopt and that will be taught in medical schools and residency programs.</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting and taking the time to read about DASH.    Please spread the word!  </p>

<h3> </h3></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","My name is Dr. Barb Steinbrecher.  
The current medical system has gotten too large, confusing, and impossible for most elders to navigate.  Due to pressures on physician ""productivity""  office visits are twenty minutes long and often double booked.  Elders complain that they feel rushed, their questions are not answered nor are their symptoms addressed.  To compensate for the lack of physician time, tests are ordered that they can't afford, medications are prescribed that they often do not need, and because most cannot drive they stop seeking medical care.  Families are also frustrated for the same reasons, especially when they live away from their parents.
I have worked in nursing homes for many years and have seen, on too many occasions, elders who could have avoided hospitalizations if they had better access to care.   We have all been convinced that health care is supposed to be technology driven, confusing by nature and expensive.  We have also been convinced that when people get old they go to nursing homes.  The reality is that most people want to stay at home-and die at home with family, friends and pets-who are often given up to shelters because they can't go with them.

My campaign is to bring back the practice of Physician House Calls and spread the notion that a ""patient centered medical home"" can and should be in their own home versus a nursing home.  Physicians can better manage complicated medical problems, anticipate and develop plans for acute decline or acute illness and reduce or prevent hospitalizations.  Stress is taken away from families and caregivers because they are part of the care plan.  Elders with Alzheimer's or other dementias are able to stay home longer; caregiver burnout is identified early and treated. Hospice and palliative care can be integrated earlier when appropriate to avoid emotional chaos as elders transition.  Physicians can work more closely with Visiting Nurse agencies as well as other home based service agencies.
 All funding goes directly to developing and providing comprehensive in-home care to community dwelling elders.  DASH is independent of large private and hospital based practices.  
We are also developing this as a viable model of health care that more physicians will adopt and that will be taught in medical schools and residency programs.
Thank you for visiting and taking the time to read about DASH.    Please spread the word!",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

If you like me, you’ll love this new one. If you don’t like me, you might be surprised. If you’ve never heard of me, this could be the start of a beautiful friendship.<br/> </p><h3>About Me</h3><p>Who ME is can be summed up by saying I’m a songwriter and an author. I’ve won the “Best Song” award in the Nashville Scene Critics Poll twice. My three books (including Cheese Chronicles, which I’ve been told is a cult classic) have four and five-star reader ratings on Amazon. I’ve written songs for Todd Snider, Jimmy Buffett, Jason and the Scorchers, Dan Baird and others. I played in Government Cheese from ’85 to ’92. I played in the bis-quits (with Will Kimbrough) from ’92 to ’94, and we had the honor of making a record for John Prine’s label. I’ve made eight solo albums since then (counting this new one) and I’ve made three albums with a side project band called Daddy (again with Will Kimbrough). <br/><br/>I’m 5’10”, I like Ray Davies, Bob Dylan and Randy Newman, I’ve been married 29 years (to the same woman, no less), Tourette’s makes me blink my eyes a lot, and I pulled my face out of a bottle nine years ago. I’m crazy (so people tell me) and my crazy self is what I write about, I write funny songs about fears (if you like what I think is funny), I write sad songs about fears, and sometimes those tunes are funny and sad at the same time. If I have any mission at all as a songwriter, some higher purpose, it’s that I seek to make other messed-up people feel less alone – the end result of that being that while I’m not everybody’s cup of tea, the people who like me tend to really really like me. <br/> </p><h3>I Thought I Was Fine</h3><p>More about the new record.  It’s a rock and roll record. I’m categorized as Americana because this business loves putting labels on people. Yes, there’s a couple of country-ish songs on it, I do live in Nashville, and my southern accent is what it is, but I had an epiphany one day. I realized, hey, I hate dobros. And if I hear another song about a train in the key of G, somebody’s gonna get hurt. I realized I’m 58 years old, I’ve survived a horrendous car crash, I’ve had cancer three times, and this might be my final shot – so I wanted to go back to my first love while there’s still time. </p><p>I went into the studio with Jonathan Bright (Raelyn Nelson Band). He played the drums and I played the guitars and the bass. This time I declared that there would be none of my skilled session friends on the record. They’re all great players, but I didn’t want great. I wanted ME. </p><p>I am very proud of this record and strongly believe it is the best album of my career.<br/> </p><h3>Why Am I Here ​On​ Indie​gogo?</h3><p>I am hoping to raise $15,000 USD to fund this project. Reaching that goal will ensure that I cover my recording, mastering, manufacturing, distribution, design, perk mailing and Indiegogo fees. Every additional penny generated will then go into the promotion of the record. None of the money will be used for personal needs under any circumstances and that includes expanding my burgeoning collection of Rolling Stones bootlegs... pinky swear.</p><p>I have been blessed with the love and support of a great team here; a nationally renowned publicist and record label, an incredible graphic designer and an experienced social media team; but they also are taking a huge risk, and as you can imagine, still recovering from the economic fallout of the pandemic. Everyone is trying to move forward, but financial flexibility is very limited which is why this funding campaign is so important in helping all of us reach our collective goal of getting as many people to hear this record as possible.</p><p>As well as the new album we’ve also come up with lots of very special goodies for you, including (but not limited to): house concerts, handwritten lyrics, hand-drawn CD and LP covers, art prints, an exclusive live CD and a very special exclusive anthology collection of all of my greatest misses called<i><strong> 30 Years Shot To Hell​</strong></i> (42 tracks on CD, 25 tracks on vinyl) which comes packaged with​ incredible photos and artwork ​that ​span my entire career.​ ​This exclusive collection is only available to those who contribute to the campaign and both albums will be available in all three formats:  CD, vinyl and digital download.</p><p><i>Note</i><i>:</i> You will notice the ​vinyl release dates are into next year. That’s because the manufacturing plants (worldwide) are severely backed up due to the pandemic. Labels and artists are now having to plan as far as 10 months ahead to get their vinyl produced. Schoolkids Records has already advanced money to manufacturing (for both albums and also to our publicist) so we can get the word out and the vinyl manufactured just as soon as we possibly can. Be assured that the moment the LP's arrive at the label’s offices they will be shipped to you immediately. These are unprecedented times and manufacturing delays and long production turnarounds are unfortunately par for the course at the moment. <br/> </p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>If you chose to support<i><strong> I Thought I Was Fine</strong></i> you will be helping keep independent music alive. More and more, independent 'Mom &amp; Pop' artists like myself rely on direct fan support to fund our recording projects, so if you have the means to contribute, that would be fantastic, and I’d be much obliged.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The <strong>Sax mini ca</strong> is the greatest little start out instrument ever. It provides a wonderful musical challenge that once mastered will give you a pathway and an understanding of  music that will enlighten you for the rest of your life. </p>
<p>It did with me and I'm sure it will with you. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1611188189/blefknh07jul27wrzccp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Hours to learn Days to Master </h3>
<p>Follow these easy steps  and develop your <strong>Saxmonica</strong> mastery.</p>
<p>As the creator of the Saxmonica I have allowed 28 days to become proficient with  this instrument.</p>
<p>This is based on the fact you have to develop your breathing and embouchure.  ( mouth muscles )</p>
<p>When you can produce consistently good tones out of all the holes then you are set for life. </p>
<p>Once learnt  the technique is never forgotten and is very easily transferable to all other wind instruments. </p>
<p>When you see all the bizarre wooden flute etc in foreign markets you can use the same technique and you might surprise yourself.  They all become very playable. </p>
<p>Learning the <strong>Saxmonica  / Sax mini ca </strong> is very similar concept to learning to ride a bike.</p>
<p>Once you develop your balance you never forget. </p>
<p>It's with you for life .  </p>

<h3>Saxmonica history</h3>
<p>This is now our fourth  crowd funding campaign.</p>
<p>In 2018 we  developed  the original Saxmonica. This was   followed by the Saxmonica Generation  2 unit where we had  developed a new mouth piece and  2 new lower tubes extending the range of the Saxmonica dramatically.</p>
<p>Further to this we created the Saxmonica app as a training tool and  information centre. </p>
<p>Having had great success with crowdfunding our initial Saxmonica we felt that its only appropriate to release the <strong>Sax mini ca</strong> with crowdfunding promotion. </p>
<p><strong>The Beginning ---  We are moving forward</strong></p>

<p><strong>First </strong><b>Kick-starter campaign video </b></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Saxminica</h3>
<p>$33 Australian =  $25 USD</p>
<p>The <strong>Sax mini ca</strong>  is a a shrunken <strong>Saxmonica</strong> that plays exactly like a <strong>Saxmonica </strong>but has much smaller holes and is shorter and thinner.  Its only one piece but still will fit in your pocket making it very easy to carry. </p>
<p>As it's easy to carry it's easy to practice and play.</p>
<p>It's unbreakable and will last 1000 years plus, so it can potentially start many music carrers in it's life time. </p>

<h3>Sax mini ca  ---  Saxmonica --- Saxophone</h3>
<p><strong>An easy progression.   Follow this path and start ripping solos.</strong></p>

<p>Immediately after our first kickstarter campaign Orian Bartov and myself developed the Saxmonica app as a way to help people develop their Saxmonica skills. </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/C_5ToX-QlpA?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>The app is full of tutorials, backing tracks and all the tips and tricks required to get the greatest sound out of your Saxmonica. </p>
<p>All the same techniques apply to the <strong>Sax mini ca </strong>so there is now a very easy path toi follow to quickly  get the most out of your <strong>Saxminica or Saxmonica. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Saxmonica music book. </h3>
<p>This is a wonderful part of the Saxmonica story when out off the blue the Weird instrument guy sent me a 12 song  music book dedicated to the Saxmonica. </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/8aUeTUno3yU?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>It has the following classics and we have made video tutorials for you to easily pick these songs up. </p>
<p>These are great songs to learn as they will give you a known melody to practice to. </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/alA0NJbZY_g?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>You can push them as hard as you like or quietly as you like. There are some great busking or jam tunes that you can rip solos with. </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
The Sax mini ca is the greatest little start out instrument ever. It provides a wonderful musical challenge that once mastered will give you a pathway and an understanding of  music that will enlighten you for the rest of your life. 
It did with me and I'm sure it will with you. 

Hours to learn Days to Master 
Follow these easy steps  and develop your Saxmonica mastery.
As the creator of the Saxmonica I have allowed 28 days to become proficient with  this instrument.
This is based on the fact you have to develop your breathing and embouchure.  ( mouth muscles )
When you can produce consistently good tones out of all the holes then you are set for life. 
Once learnt  the technique is never forgotten and is very easily transferable to all other wind instruments. 
When you see all the bizarre wooden flute etc in foreign markets you can use the same technique and you might surprise yourself.  They all become very playable. 
Learning the Saxmonica  / Sax mini ca  is very similar concept to learning to ride a bike.
Once you develop your balance you never forget. 
It's with you for life .  

 
Saxmonica history
This is now our fourth  crowd funding campaign.
In 2018 we  developed  the original Saxmonica. This was   followed by the Saxmonica Generation  2 unit where we had  developed a new mouth piece and  2 new lower tubes extending the range of the Saxmonica dramatically.
Further to this we created the Saxmonica app as a training tool and  information centre. 
Having had great success with crowdfunding our initial Saxmonica we felt that its only appropriate to release the Sax mini ca with crowdfunding promotion. 
The Beginning ---  We are moving forward

First Kick-starter campaign video 
 
The Saxminica
$33 Australian =  $25 USD
The Sax mini ca  is a a shrunken Saxmonica that plays exactly like a Saxmonica but has much smaller holes and is shorter and thinner.  Its only one piece but still will fit in your pocket making it very easy to carry. 
As it's easy to carry it's easy to practice and play.
It's unbreakable and will last 1000 years plus, so it can potentially start many music carrers in it's life time. 
 
Sax mini ca  ---  Saxmonica --- Saxophone
An easy progression.   Follow this path and start ripping solos.

 
A path to all wind instruments

Size difference 
Sax mini ca has smaller holes to suit smaller hands.  It doesn't have quite the same volume but its
close.

 
 
Saxmonica  and Saxminica  Plays in B Flat
Tones  and Keys 

 
 
Saxmonica app
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.saxmonica&hl=en_NZ&gl=US
Immediately after our first kickstarter campaign Orian Bartov and myself developed the Saxmonica app as a way to help people develop their Saxmonica skills. 

The app is full of tutorials, backing tracks and all the tips and tricks required to get the greatest sound out of your Saxmonica. 
All the same techniques apply to the Sax mini ca so there is now a very easy path toi follow to quickly  get the most out of your Saxminica or Saxmonica. 
 
The Saxmonica music book. 
This is a wonderful part of the Saxmonica story when out off the blue the Weird instrument guy sent me a 12 song  music book dedicated to the Saxmonica. 

It has the following classics and we have made video tutorials for you to easily pick these songs up. 
These are great songs to learn as they will give you a known melody to practice to. 

You can push them as hard as you like or quietly as you like. There are some great busking or jam tunes that you can rip solos with. 
Song List 
Somewhere Over the Rainbow                    Summertime
Mary Had a Little Lamb                                 Row Row Row Your Boat 
Camptown Races.                                           The Wedding Song 
Amazing Grace                                                 Pink Panther
Its Raining                                                         Kagome
Arirangi                                                              Twinkle Twinkle Little Star 
Master anyone of these and you can master them all. 
 
Saxmonica Meditation Music 
As we developed the Saxmonica sound we spent some time creating and playing over some beautiful meditation tracks. These are available on the Saxmonica app or Sound Cloud.

Breathing Exercise

 

General coordination and finger movement is great for the elderly so will easily provide a nice little pastime full of small challenges. 
Children will develop further confidence as their skills develop  giving  a wonderful pathway into many different ways of life. 
As the  inventor I see absolutely no downside to learning a Saxmonica.  
My story is full of  amazing musical encounters with a group of fascinating people.  I am sure this will continue as long as I blow my Saxmonica as Im sure it will for any one that takes on the Saxmonica challenge.

Keeping away from traditional music theory that can be very complicated , we have concentrated on developing the basic skills, being breathing, developing your embouchure and timing.

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>We are a Boston-area Indie Folk duo comprised of singer-songwriter Greg Kane and vocalist Kat Brooks. Our original compositions are born out of personal experience and life lessons, brought to life by Greg's writing, singing and engaging guitar playing, and Kat's inventive harmonies, arrangements and percussion. Like a confluence of two rivers, we came together as solo artists who found that the combination of our talents was greater than the sum of its individual parts.</p>
<p>Our first album, ""A Light On Here"" was originally slated to be a ""Greg Kane"" album with Kat singing background, but we discovered a pretty unique bond and chemistry that encouraged us to form a duo.</p>
<p>So, although ""Other Likely Stories"" is our ""sophomore"" album, it is truly the FIRST album conceived and created by us live and in real time. Our vocals, guitar and percussion were all recorded live, and our special guest musicians have added their parts in layers that truly fulfill our vision for the album.</p>
<h3>What IS This?</h3>
<p>This album, for us, has felt ""fated"" to happen, and is truly a labor of love. Because our songs are born of life experience, we feel we have universal, yet relatable messages to share with our audience. The essence of ""folk"" music is something we draw from, combining heartfelt emotion  with humanitarian messages, but primarily promoting our basic message of love and inclusivity. We have chosen a mix of eleven of our best originals, highlighting our individual and combined strengths, with a few led by each of us, but always bringing our voices together in the harmonies we have become known for.</p>
<p>As the global pandemic hit us all, we, like many of our contemporaries, experienced a complete end to our newly-formed endeavor, as public gatherings were banned and venues were forced to shut their doors to indoor AND outdoor dining and performance opportunities. As we slowly rebuild our business and plan for an exciting new future, we find ourselves needing to reach out for financial support for the logistics of releasing this new album, and this is where your investment comes into play.</p>
<h3>The Ask</h3>
<ul><li>We are looking to raise a minimum of $7,000, which we believe will cover the entire cost of our studio recording with our engineer, Casey Dawson, and hiring of guest musicians, along with our new promotional photographs and videos done by the incomparable Emily Joy Ashman and Michael Robert Kelly of Tri Town Productions and The Illustrated Room. There is a great deal that goes into the creation and promotion of an album, and we feel passionate about creating the best product possible, and supporting every member of our team for their highly skilled professional work.</li></ul>
</div><div><ul>
<li><p>For our campaign, we wanted our perks to cover a wide range of potential donation amounts, with fun rewards. We want YOU to feel like an INVESTOR in our album, because that is exactly what you are. There will be a way for you to ""just donate"" ANY amount without expectation of return, but we'd rather reward you! Each Perk Level includes everything from the previous levels plus something new. Every dollar you invest will further and enrich the project, and we're excited to share the end result with you!</p></li>
<li><p>If and when we exceed our $7000 goal, our ""stretch goals"" will include the much-needed upgrading of our live sound system, which is currently comprised of one small used Fishman amp and a 4-channel mixer. As we grow and expand to larger audiences, a more comprehensive sound system will assist us in accommodating that growth. In the near future, we would love to hire a publicist or manager to help us reach our goals of broadening our impact.</p></li>
</ul></div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul><li>We believe intrinsically in the messages we convey in our music. We feel that what we have to share is important, especially considering the current state of our world. Our collaboration as musical partners and friends has benefitted us as individuals, and we are honored that it has served others as well. Our impact stems from the connection and chemistry we have, and this new album has both in spades. We survived not only a global pandemic, but also the 15 month separation caused by it, and have been able to reconnect musically like never before. This album was to be our primary goal for 2020, so this ""dream deferred"" has become our main focus for 2021, as well as our work to regain our live performance schedule, so that we can continue living our dreams as professional musicians.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The eleven songs on this album chronicle the lived experiences not only of ourselves, but of that of others spanning history; from a true story about a sinking warship in the 1800s to the current challenges that face immigrants seeking safety in a new home. From a universal message of heartbreak, loss and second chances to imagining how tangible objects from the past can connect us to the people who once owned them. Some of our stories speak to and from the perspective of the LGBTQIA community, neurodiversity and also to other marginalized groups whose points of view we empathize with. Our goal is not to re-tell, but to “spotlight” and honor the voices that deserve to be amplified. </li></ul>
<ul><li>When we released our first album, ""A Light On Here,"" the title track and subsequent video received attention and recognition from Project Amplify, a non-profit organization founded by Neil Young underscoring the plight of immigrants and refugees.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The songs in our new album are similar in their heartfelt messages, universally understandable, yet directed to a variety of diverse communities, while also representing our own personal values and beliefs.</li></ul>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Where We Are</span></h3>
</div><div>
<ul>
<li><p>We have already been working for months on this album, from rehearsals to recording, and have completed the first major step: Live recording, side by side, with our amazing guest percussionist, Jahnu, enhancing our tracks. All recording and promotional costs have been out-of-pocket, which is where this crowdfunding campaign lends its support.</p></li>
<li><p>Our next steps involve adding the contributing layers of the other gifted guest performers who are lending their talents to our project.</p></li>
<li><p>Mixing and mastering comprise the next elements on the horizon, as does the intricate album design being worked on by Emily Joy Ashman, and we are so excited to view the results!</p></li>

All recording and promotional costs have been out-of-pocket, which is where this crowdfunding campaign lends its support.
Our next steps involve adding the contributing layers of the other gifted guest performers who are lending their talents to our project.
Mixing and mastering comprise the next elements on the horizon, as does the intricate album design being worked on by Emily Joy Ashman, and we are so excited to view the results!
There are so many moving parts to creating a new album, and we tackle every learning curve as it crops up.

<p>Welcome! Thank you for visiting me here on Indiegogo and taking an interest in my new EP. If you have any questions feel free to visit the Q&amp;A section of the site. Please keep reading to find out more!</p>

<p><strong>More About The Songs</strong>:</p>
<p>Dark Ability was written in May of 2021 and recorded in UltraSoundStudios / Öhme Studios by Daniel Cardoso (Anathema) in July of 2021. Initially they were old melodic ideas I put on the side, so they got developed and finished together with the lyrics very recently. They are very atmospheric and melancholic songs where you can find electronic elements and ambiance combined with a very intimate voice. This music is meant to touch your heart and bring you into a journey of darkness and hope.</p>

<p>Daniel Cardoso</p>
<p><strong>A Darker Direction</strong>:</p>
<p>As you know, besides my bands Tristania and Ardours I love to be active as a solo artist as well. In fact, I wrote a solo album in 2013 that I decided not to release in the end cause I was not sure about the direction I was taking at that time. I learned a lot by making songs and recording them in the studio..and that it is why I am more than happy now to release these 4 fresh tunes that really express the more realistic aspect of my personality and where I am living right now. I need very strong motivations behind a release, and I went into deep research before releasing any song to the world. These songs are also a very dark expression of myself. I went through a lot of emotional pain during this year and these songs were written during probably the 2 hardest weeks of my life. They were born out of suffering and tears, literally. I used these dark moments for resilience and for finding the strength to go on in every aspect, and I think I made it, that is why I am so proud of this EP and look forward to you hearing it.</p>
<p><strong>Musicians</strong>:</p>
<p>- Mariangela Demurtas: Lyric and Music </p>
<p>- Daniel Cardoso of Anathema: Engineering, Mixing, Master, Arranging, All Instruments.</p>
<p>I chose Daniel because he is amazing at bringing out the best in you as a singer when you are in the studio, he is also a great friend and we have also worked together in the past. I am very confident in his musical talents and that is why I wanted him on board. I am sure you will love what he brought to my songs as well.</p>
<p><strong>Artwork</strong>:</p>
<p>Black and White is the main theme of this EP, it definitely represents my art better, in fact is definitely inspired by the songs. Beatriz Mariano is the artist behind the songs and the pictures. I am absolutely amazed by the way she is capable of interpreting my feelings. By working together we want to give you an image that could bring you into this dark dimension.</p>

<p><i><strong>Hey friends, </strong></i><br/><br/>Folksinger Willi Carlisle here. For the past five years, I’ve been touring back and forth across the continent telling stories. I’ve released two records, three plays, and performed hundreds of shows.<br/><br/><strong>Now, it’s time for me to make a new record that synthesizes that hard work. </strong></p>
<p>Why? The news is good. After going (a little) viral, amassing over a million cross-platform engagements, downloads, album sales, etc, stuff is bigger than I ever imagined! And all without any big-production or assistance. Just my voice and an instrument.<br/><br/><strong>We are growing fast (even during the pandemic), and with a Grammy Winning Producer and a badass record-label (TBA) on board, it’s time to make something big!</strong><br/><br/>This collection of folksongs and stories is gonna be better, weirder, wilder than ever, <i>and with a real publicity team, extremely talented support, and incredible musicianship from friends and family, this could have the momentum to reach millions more people.</i></p>
<p><i><strong>WHAT I NEED / WHAT YA GET: </strong></i></p>
<p>Joel Savoy, one of the finest roots musicians working today, will be producing! But the pandemic <i>ruined my plan to raise money</i> for the recording process. It ruined lots of stuff. With touring gone for another few months, it’s time to turn to another format. Here’s where you come in. And I'll pay you back in love as well as early-access, concerts, and new merchandise!<br/><br/><strong>The Money Breakdown</strong> is mostly for a week in the studio, mixing, and mastering. Joel’s rates are amazingly reasonable: around 4k. Then, about 3k will be going to high-quality mixing and mastering (so that it sounds perfect on vinyl). Then, my math adds 1k for session musicians, about 500 to travel, and about 1.5k to reproduce vinyl, shirts, and more in our first run. <strong>That totals 10k!</strong> It sounds like a lot, but it’s pretty average at this level.</p>
<p><strong>So why Pre-Order?</strong> Because it’s your chance to get first dibs on new merch, but also <i>exclusive stuff like a limited edition poster, bandana, private zoom concerts, covers, and house shows! </i>Get what you’d want anyway, but get all the extras, personal touches, and more that make it special.</p>

Your contribution will change my life, and help me grow my life’s work: to explore America and tell these finely-aged stories around the world, getting rooms full of people of different backgrounds to sing, dance, and party together. <br/><br/>So far, my project has led me to share stages with international acts many times my size and reach (like Dom Flemons and Los Texmaniacs), to get on planes to Europe, tractors to Kansas,  vans to Las Vegas. My work has sent me on tour for months on end to entertain thousands of people in person. How can I tell you? <strong>I’m gonna be doing this forever anyway, and despite everything, this has been an unexpectedly great year for my songs, so we gotta grow. I hope we can grow together.</strong></p>
<p><strong><i>RISKY BUSINESS?</i></strong></p>
<p>It’s a tough time for music, truly. As Americans increasingly stream their music, and the  pandemic lowers economic confidence, it might be hard to get people to want a vinyl, to want a  concert. You know? </p>

Four times our initial budget - over a QUARTER MILLION - over $300,000 raised! Thank you all so much for the immensely generous support. It means a lot to see people believe in this project, despite knowing almost nothing about it except that it'll be very different from my previous ones. I can't wait to show you the final product.</h3><h3>Physical perks will be sent out as they are finished production! Event details have been sent out to their pass holders!</h3><p><strong>[Note: You may notice the final number raised ends up lowered or lower than was announced when the campaign ended. This is due to an error with the highest priced perk needing to be removed, but yes we did still reach that $300K mark, and will still end up with the budget mentioned above once we work things out!]</strong></p><p> </p><p>=================================================================</p><h2><strong><u>Creating ""In Case I Make It,"" ...in case I die.</u></strong></h2><p>Hello. My name's Will Wood, and over the past couple years of <i>undeniable badness, instability, pestilence, nightmarishly brutally honest introspection</i>, <i>that weird parasocial crowded isolation, the assumptions I was mortally doomed, and attempts to get well,</i> I've quietly written a huge collection of my most personal songs yet. As I tried to heal from whatever it was one would call whatever I was, I kept writing these very new and very different songs, thinking to myself ""I need to get this out in case I die.""<br/><strong>But eventually, after enough time and work, I chose to hope despite all of what seemed like many very good reasons not to.</strong></p><p>I'm reinventing myself as an artist, because to be honest I've reinvented myself as a person, and I want to finally be able to express the parts of me that my fans rarely ever see, or wouldn't even guess are there.</p><p>So the album I half-lucidly planned to call ""In Case I Die"" became ""In Case I Make It.""</p><p>I'm nervous about this album. I don't get stage fright. I guess because I rarely felt vulnerable. But I'm taking some serious risks here.

THANK YOU!We did it, and then some! We demolished our original goal of $75K at 400%! Four times our initial budget - over a QUARTER MILLION - over $300,000 raised! Thank you all so much for the immensely generous support. It means a lot to see people believe in this project, despite knowing almost nothing about it except that it'll be very different from my previous ones. I can't wait to show you the final product.Physical perks will be sent out as they are finished production! Event details have been sent out to their pass holders![Note: You may notice the final number raised ends up lowered or lower than was announced when the campaign ended. This is due to an error with the highest priced perk needing to be removed, but yes we did still reach that $300K mark, and will still end up with the budget mentioned above once we work things out!] =================================================================Creating ""In Case I Make It,"" ...in case I die.Hello. My name's Will Wood, and over the past couple years of undeniable badness, instability, pestilence, nightmarishly brutally honest introspection, that weird parasocial crowded isolation, the assumptions I was mortally doomed, and attempts to get well, I've quietly written a huge collection of my most personal songs yet. As I tried to heal from whatever it was one would call whatever I was, I kept writing these very new and very different songs, thinking to myself ""I need to get this out in case I die.""But eventually, after enough time and work, I chose to hope despite all of what seemed like many very good reasons not to.I'm reinventing myself as an artist, because to be honest I've reinvented myself as a person, and I want to finally be able to express the parts of me that my fans rarely ever see, or wouldn't even guess are there.So the album I half-lucidly planned to call ""In Case I Die"" became ""In Case I Make It.""I'm nervous about this album. I don't get stage fright. I guess because I rarely felt vulnerable. But I'm taking some serious risks here. I think good art happens when you give an audience what they want, and great art happens when you give them something they didn't know they could ask for.I'm going for the second one, and I wanna make sure you end up being glad I did.WHAT AM I TRYING TO DO?• Create my biggest record yet.I have a huge list of songs I've written for this album, and I want to produce and release as many of them as I can.• Hire the most talented and qualified artists and professionals.Fully orchestrated with entire brass band and string section, (and more!) composed by yours truly and arranged by myself and the Tapeworms.• Write & direct videos that are my most elaborate, high quality, and honestly expressive yet.A higher budget allows for greater creative freedom and more powerful visual storytelling.• Create a variety of other multimedia works and events to accompany the album.It takes a lot of different types of media to create, deliver, and promote a new vision. I hope to create better promotional materials, have higher quality in all of my regular work, and even take on new experimental projects like designing interactive album art and hosting specialized concert events for the album.This large-scale project will follow up The Normal Album with a sprawling album full of brand new sounds, grossly personal and emotional lyrics with hopefully the right amount of humor and cynicism, elaborate orchestration, and songs many have been asking to hear studio versions of for years. WHAT YOUR HELP MAKES POSSIBLE:If I'm to succeed in making this the biggest, yet most intimate, work of my career, I need to finally secure a real pro budget for the first time, and really do it right. So, I'll be working my fingers to the bone to make sure you get as much as possible for your contributions.The more we raise (especially if we break the goal point) the more we can do!What that means is: better production quality, more songs on the final cut, more videos to follow it all, and more!The more you give to the campaign, the more I can give to you and everyone else who's following. HOW DOES THIS WORK?Indiegogo is a powerful community platform that helps artists connect with fans, so they can work together as a unit to make otherwise impossible things happen.In exchange for your contribution, I'm offering a TON of huge, exclusive perks.These include: limited edition merch, pre-orders of limited edition signed albums, the chance to be on the album, exclusive events/experiences/private shows, AND MORE.I'll be personally overseeing the creation and distribution of these perks, and working extra hard to make sure that you're thrilled with these exclusive, rare items, and once in a lifetime experiences.That way, even if you hear this album and it, for whatever reason, makes you want to drive nails through your ear drums, you'll at least know you've got something special and unique, and some memories nobody else gets to have.➼ Check the list of perks on the right to see what wild stuff I'll do in exchange for your support!!! ""In Case I Make It,""• I'll be releasing my most self-aware, brutally honest, and personal work yet.• I'll be composing my most elaborately orchestrated and highest-quality album yet.• I'll be making a sprawling LP (maybe even a double if we raise enough!) worth of new music, with songs only Patreon members have heard before, and some nobody ever has.• I'll be directing, writing, and producing my highest-quality and creative music videos yet.• I'll be launching a re-defining new era of everything WW.I can't possibly do this stuff without you. I've been blessed to have unbelievably supportive fans, who have made many projects that otherwise would've been impossible happen.As a team, we've made some big stuff, and I need your help making my biggest project yet - so I can express my realest self in case I don't make it.

Coming to the world

Cover by world renowned space artist, David A. Hardy.
 
Who is Lobate Scarp?
We are a progressive opera-rock band based in Los Angeles. Our influences range from classic prog-rock of the 70's such as Genesis and Yes, to 80's pop such as Duran Duran and Tears for Fears, as well as strong ties to musical theater. 
Our goal is to make albums that take the listener on a unique musical journey covering a wide spectrum of sounds and genres. 
 

 
We are not backed by a label, so we depend highly on our fans contributions and support. And in return we will create high quality/ well produced fresh new prog-rock music for you to enjoy!
 
Here's a track from our 2019 EP, and there will also be a new and improved version on the new album!


 
 


Let's get epic! 
You Have It All  will serve as an expansion to our 2019 EP Spirals and Portals, interweaving ""Nothing Wrong"" and ""Beautiful Light"" within the album to tell a more cohesive musical story.  It consists of nine tracks, totaling more than an hour in length, including  “Conduit"", our first fully instrumental piece.  Rich Mouser, whose mixing repertoire includes Spock’s Beard, Transatlantic, Neal Morse,  will once again mix our album, as well as join as co-producer and engineer on many of the tracks.  Steve Leavitt, producer of our debut album Time and Space, will also return to co-produce and engineer.  Progressive rock fans will especially appreciate the 14 1/2-minute title track as well as our 17 minute finale ""Flowing Through The Change"" which deals with both acceptance of the past and looking into the future for exciting possibilities!

<p>Hello and thank you for checking out my Indiegogo campaign! I'm excited to get back into the studio to record ""We Got This - Side 2"" a new 6 song EP that will be a companion to ""We Got This"" a 6 song EP I released in November 2020.</p>
<p>I've been a professional musician for over 10 years, and am so excited to have the opportunity to record a new 6 song EP in Toronto! I need a little help and support from my friends and fans though, and your contribution is immensely appreciated!</p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>For those of you I've yet to have the pleasure to meet, my name is Melanie Peterson! I'm a professional musician (and actress) born in Saskatoon and based in Toronto. I'm pursuing my dream career of writing songs and performing them for large audiences. I write daily because I believe continuity of practice is the secret of success. Not to mention, I love sharing my new songs with people, It brings me soul satisfaction to know I've reached someone with my art. This is the one of the best jobs in the world and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon!</p>

<h3>About my EP Project:</h3>
<p>My EP will consist of six original songs that are near and dear to my heart. Songs about love, escape, diamonds, tequila and more. Songs I wrote before and during the pandemic. I will be recording at Revolution Recording in Toronto with Mitch Girio of Slow Cooker Studios as my producer, Joao Carvahlo of Carvalho Mastering will master the EP and Bri-Anne Myers will do the album art. I will have the help of some top notch musicians on my album as well!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My goal is to raise $10,000. This money will cover the cost of studio time, studio musicians, mixing, mastering and manufacturing of the EP, album art, a video for the lead single and a publicist to promote the EP once it's ready for release! This is not my first time at the rodeo, so I know every little thing that needs to be paid for. If you would like a complete break down of the budget, please email me at melanieacts@hotmail.com.</p>

<p><u>No matter what is happening around the world, we need our health. But we also need music, art, theatre, poetry, freedom of expression and creativity.</u></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong><u>About this project</u></strong></h3>
<p>I started writing songs for this project in early 2019, and my concept has carried into 2020 with a dream to release this new album in the fall of this year. I considered changing my plans due to the current global situation, but felt that would be the wrong choice in these times, as I truly believe music can help us more than ever, through uncertainty, fear and confusion.</p>
<p>This album has songs co-written with some amazing friends and colleagues of mine, all of whom are talented and creative artists who work hard on their craft and are well known in their respective genres and music scenes. I am so grateful to all of these artists/writers for their contributions to this album. Not only did they co-write the songs, but most of them are also scheduled to be featured playing their instruments on this album, on the songs we co-wrote together. Left to right: Bob Fridzema (Netherlands/Denmark), Suzie Vinnick (Canada), Jackie Venson (USA), Layla Zoe (Canada), Alastair Greene (USA), Dimitri LeBel (Canada), Brandi Disterheft (USA/Canada) and Guy Smeets (Netherlands). </p>
<p>Due to the current circumstances and inability to cross the border from Netherlands to Germany, I was forced to cancel the studio time I had booked this year for this project, and change the recording plans to include only home studio recordings from each musician.</p>
<p>This album is about bringing musicians together during this difficult time, giving them some work, allowing creativity, and keeping us together in communicating and making art, in the face of a grim situation in our business right now.</p>
<p><strong>This is why I feel so passionately about this project. </strong><br/><br/>Whether I am able to tour the new album later this year or not, is still to be decided by local governments and regulations. But whether or not the tour can go on or not, I feel strongly that these songs should be recorded and made available to the fans.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong><u>How you can help</u></strong></h3>
<p>By helping me to raise the money I need, you will be making a dream come true, during what would otherwise be a nightmare year for most musicians and music industry professionals. Most of all, you will be giving me the support I need to carry forward creatively, and also support this small village of musicians in the process. All of my concerts were cancelled up until August so far, so as you can imagine I am unable to finance this album alone.</p>
<p><strong>Your help is vital in making this project a reality.</strong></p>
<p>With all my love and gratitude to all of you around the world, <br/><strong>Layla Zoe</strong> <br/> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u>What is needed to finish this album</u></h3>
<p>To finish this album I need a minimum of 7000 euros.</p>
<p>This money will go towards:<br/>Paying the co-writers each a small fee for their recordings.<br/>Paying the session musicians for their work on the entire album (bass, drums, guitar and keys.)<br/>Paying the engineer for his time mixing and mastering the album.<br/>Paying the studio time to record my vocals.<br/>Paying the photographer and graphic artist for their artwork and creativity on the CD graphics.<br/>And any money left over will be used to promote the album and send it out to radio, journalists and promoters for possible reviews, airplay, and opportunities. <br/><br/><strong><u>Every penny raised will go towards this project, and the many people involved.</u></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong><u>We have some very exciting perks</u></strong></h3>
<p>Signed copies of the new album before the release date!<br/>Merch packages including the new album and copies of past releases!<br/>Handwritten song lyrics from the album!<br/>Your name mentioned in the CD graphics later, and a signed CD!<br/>Skype calls!<br/>A picnic! (Local fan only, and respecting social distancing rules and regulations.)<br/>And even two beautiful autographed guitars!</p>
<p>Please, with your help, I know we can do this together, and make this a group project in every way.</p>
<p>I am so grateful to all of you who already supported my last crowdfunding campaign, for my critically acclaimed double album ""Gemini"" which was released in 2018. I was able to raise over 10,000 euros to finish that album with your help, and the result was a wonderful double disk of songs and some lovely perks that were appreciated deeply by all the fans who donated.<br/> </p>
<h3><u>Risks &amp; Challenges</u></h3>
<p>This is a hard time for many artists. I have had many conversations with friends and colleagues in the music business all over the world. And especially for those with families, this has been a crushing blow to their financial survival, but also to their self esteem as artists. Right now, we need to be reminded that art and music are important to our listeners and supporters.<br/>I have been overwhelmed by how creative and intuitive many artists have been in finding new ways to make music, share music, teach Skype lessons and many other beautiful ideas, to find new forms of income. <u>It will be difficult to raise funds at a time like this, with so many people in need</u>, so many artists asking for support and so many people feeling the financial uncertainty of the future.<br/><br/><strong>But I have absolute FAITH that TOGETHER we can create, fund, and finish this album. <br/>We have done it before and I know we can do this again!</strong><br/> </p>
<h3><strong><u>Other Ways You Can Help</u></strong></h3>
<p><br/>Of course not everyone has the money to support this project at this time, and that is absolutely understood. But there are other ways you can help, by sharing this campaign with friends, colleagues, music lovers and family! Telling everyone about the talented artists involved in this project and letting people know how and where they can go to support these artists. <br/>(See websites for co-writers.)</p>
<p>And of course just holding us in your hearts and sending us your support verbally, energetically and lovingly, can also be a way to contribute to this project. Every bit helps right now..</p>
<p><br/><strong>If you have any questions about this campaign, how the money will be used, when and where the recordings will take place, additional questions about the artists/co-writers involved, or any other enquiries that may help you to decide if you want to fund this campaign or not, please feel free to write me at: laylazoe13@gmail.com</strong></p>

This money will go towards:Paying the co-writers each a small fee for their recordings.Paying the session musicians for their work on the entire album (bass, drums, guitar and keys.)Paying the engineer for his time mixing and mastering the album.Paying the studio time to record my vocals.Paying the photographer and graphic artist for their artwork and creativity on the CD graphics.And any money left over will be used to promote the album and send it out to radio, journalists and promoters for possible reviews, airplay, and opportunities. Every penny raised will go towards this project, and the many people involved.
 
We have some very exciting perks
Signed copies of the new album before the release date!Merch packages including the new album and copies of past releases!Handwritten song lyrics from the album!Your name mentioned in the CD graphics later, and a signed CD!Skype calls!A picnic! (Local fan only, and respecting social distancing rules and regulations.)And even two beautiful autographed guitars!
Please, with your help, I know we can do this together, and make this a group project in every way.
I am so grateful to all of you who already supported my last crowdfunding campaign, for my critically acclaimed double album ""Gemini"" which was released in 2018. I was able to raise over 10,000 euros to finish that album with your help, and the result was a wonderful double disk of songs and some lovely perks that were appreciated deeply by all the fans who donated. 
Risks & Challenges
This is a hard time for many artists. I have had many conversations with friends and colleagues in the music business all over the world. And especially for those with families, this has been a crushing blow to their financial survival, but also to their self esteem as artists. Right now, we need to be reminded that art and music are important to our listeners and supporters.I have been overwhelmed by how creative and intuitive many artists have been in finding new ways to make music, share music, teach Skype lessons and many other beautiful ideas, to find new forms of income. It will be difficult to raise funds at a time like this, with so many people in need, so many artists asking for support and so many people feeling the financial uncertainty of the future.But I have absolute FAITH that TOGETHER we can create, fund, and finish this album. We have done it before and I know we can do this again! 
Other Ways You Can Help
Of course not everyone has the money to support this project at this time, and that is absolutely understood. But there are other ways you can help, by sharing this campaign with friends, colleagues, music lovers and family! Telling everyone about the talented artists involved in this project and letting people know how and where they can go to support these artists. (See websites for co-writers.)
And of course just holding us in your hearts and sending us your support verbally, energetically and lovingly, can also be a way to contribute to this project. Every bit helps right now..
If you have any questions about this campaign, how the money will be used, when and where the recordings will take place, additional questions about the artists/co-writers involved, or any other enquiries that may help you to decide if you want to fund this campaign or not, please feel free to write me at: laylazoe13@gmail.com",7.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h2>The Story Behind the Record</h2>
<p>In 1987, after hearing a demo tape of Robert Vaughn &amp; The Shadows, The 77s’ Michael Roe and Jan Eric Volz traveled from Sacramento – home of Exit Records – to San Diego to see the band perform live.  Returning to Sacramento impressed with their sound and talent, Roe and Volz encouraged their label – also home to Charlie Peacock, Vector, and others – to sign the band, making Robert Vaughn &amp; The Shadows the <i>first</i> band outside the Sacramento area to be signed to Exit, which had recently inked a distribution deal with Island Records, U2’s parent label.  (As fate would have it, Robert Vaughn &amp; The Shadows was also the <i>last</i> band Exit signed.)<br/><br/>Given a large recording budget and significant nationwide radio play on AOR radio, Robert Vaughn &amp; The Shadows even garnered an appearance on Dick Clark’s <i>American Bandstand</i>.  Their first album for Exit, <i>Love and War</i>, was even slated for a CD release.  However, given the Exit/Island distribution deal’s limitations, there wasn’t enough money and promotion to propel them further, leading to the deal’s untimely demise.  As such, Exit dropped all of its signed acts and abandoned plans to release <i>Love and War</i> on CD.</p>
<p>Now free agents, Robert Vaughn &amp; The Shadows landed on my label, Alternative Records, and recorded <i>Songs from the Riverhouse</i>, which helped them sign a short-lived deal with CBS Records (unreleased), then with Miramar and distributed by RCA – Robert Vaughn &amp; The Dead River Angels’ eponymous album – before effectively retiring from the music business altogether.<br/><br/>In the intervening decades, nearly every Exit act had received their master tapes back and worked diligently to remaster and reissue their back catalogs.  <i>Love and War</i> was a major exception.  However, in early 2021, we worked out a deal with Exit to obtain the multi-track master tapes – and everything else Robert Vaughn-related from that era that languished in Exit’s vaults – so that we could remaster <i>Love and War</i> and produce a limited-edition run of CDs containing a ton of extras!<br/><br/>This Indiegogo campaign marks Alternative Records’ official return after a long period of dormancy.  The only reason for coming out of dormancy is two-fold:  (1) <i>Love and</i> <i>War </i>deserves the CD treatment, and (2) I <i>really</i> want to get this album out there!  I have already spent months using the best sources to achieve the best possible sound, and the new CD artwork will match that effort.  In terms of extras, songs and mixes not found on the original LP are simply jaw-dropping.  My hope is that Robert Vaughn fans will be as excited as I was to listen to the original album once again, in a fresh way.  You will hear so much more of the mix, and I guarantee you that this remaster will blow you away sonically and musically.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>Funding &amp; Project Goals</h2>
<p>1.  Normally, most campaigns raise funds first and, if successful, transfer and bake the original tapes, (re)create the original artwork, remaster the album, etc.  Because it was important for me to hear exactly what we had, I’ve already spent considerable effort and funds getting the tapes in order.  The good news is that the masters were in very good condition.  Given the effort so far, I have a pretty good idea now of how much the campaign will require to produce this limited CD run and get everything into your hands relatively quickly after the campaign’s end.<br/><br/>2.  $5,700 should be sufficient to pay the aforementioned costs – just enough to produce the project and get it to you and the band.  Aside from the pride that comes from releasing this phenomenal album, I will not profit monetarily from this campaign.  There are two avenues we can go with the available material.  The focus will be on producing a double CD, with the core album on one CD and the second CD containing demos, new mixes, works-in-progress, and unheard, unreleased songs from the <i>Love and War</i> sessions.  If we <u>don’t</u> reach the goal of $5,700, a single CD containing the original album, plus a few new mixes, would still be possible, with a funding goal of $5,200.  <i>Of course</i>, I pray the campaign will be successful enough to fund a 2-CD version.  Once funded, I plan to have <i>Love and War</i> in your hands within 4-6 weeks.</p>
<p>3.  Make no mistake:  <strong>This is a limited, one-time run of <i>Love and War</i> on <u>CD only</u></strong>.  I have <u>no plans to release the album on vinyl</u>, simply because the original LP is readily available on the third-party market.  Nevertheless, purchasing this limited-edition 2-CD version of <i>Love and War</i> will both ensure that the album survives and provide future income for the band members, who never saw much money from the original album sales.</p>
<p>4.  As a final, personal note, my own health is not terrific, and it’s likely this special <i>Love and War</i> re-release will be about the last thing Alternative Records will release.  (There are a few others projects I want to do, but it’s iffy whether that can happen).  So, it means a LOT to me personally, and I hope this project will mean a lot to you, too, as we reveal more during the course of the campaign.</p>
</div><div><h2>Risks &amp; Rewards</h2></div><div><p>I’ve put a lot of work into this already – seriously, I could write several pages of drama and intrigue about this – so short of not reaching our funding goal, the risks of not being able to deliver the product or suffering unexpected delays are virtually negligible.  If we reach our funding goal, an order of 300 double CDs is attainable.  We’ll also be doing a lot on social media and sharing music tidbits as we go along so you can enjoy the ride to the final destination.  If for some reason this campaign fails and the CD re-release doesn’t happen, you will, of course, receive a full refund.</p></div><div>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>If this <i>Love and War</i> re-release appeals to you, please get the word out!  We’ll be sharing more later on how to do that, how you can see your name in the album credits, and other ways you can be a part of this great album!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, I’m Bo!</p>
<p>I’m an artist from Portland, Oregon. For the last few years, I’ve been releasing singles, which gave me the opportunity to really create an identity for each song as it’s own entity. For me, the intention with writing music has always been to create imagery that would allow me to be vulnerable with the listener and hopefully give them something relatable and something they could connect with.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619302901/vdgi1ygzfvvf46isldkh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>For over a year, I’ve been writing, arranging and putting together the right songs to present a brief but specific representation of my life that has reflected my perspective of relationships, friendships and the challenges of life in general.</p>
<p>Up to this point, I’ve been completely self funded, and I’ve been really proud of the content that I’ve been able to put together on my own. However, the pandemic changed things for me in the beginning of 2020, when I suddenly was out of work. Between that and terminating the contract with my label, my plans for this EP continued to get pushed further back, but I’ve continued to produce and create the songs, as well as the the extra content, with some of my favorite creatives to make sure that no detail is spared for this release.</p>
<p>In order to finish this production, I’m going to need a little help from all of you! For studio time, mixing, distribution, PR, and other promotional material, I’ve totaled a cost of about $15,000. However, with this campaign, I’m asking for your help in funding studio time, mixing, and distribution so I can wrap it up and get this EP finished the right way and into your hands ASAP!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I believe that crowdfunding is a powerful tool that gives myself and other artists agency over what we create, and a platform to use our own voices, uninhibited by the inner workings of the music industry, to create and distribute our art the way we intend. By backing this campaign, you're putting the power back in the hands of creators! </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I completely understand how difficult things have been for everybody, from the pandemic to the hardships of general life. If you’re a fan of my music but aren’t able to financially back the campaign, don’t even worry about it! If you still want to support me and my project, feel free to share this campaign and spread the word!</p>

<h3>Hi there, my name's John. Some of you might know me as Culprate...</h3>
<p>This journey started many moons ago, in fact I've been releasing music on various record labels since 2010, which is pretty mad when I think about it. I'm based in the beautiful South West of England with my wife and two crazy kids. Over the years I've produced all sorts of genres, styles and flavours of music but I was initially synonymous with the underground dubstep movement. I then went on to write an album called Colours which sort of changed the rhetoric. Later, in 2014, I was convinced to crowdfund an ambitious 'experimental album' project on this very platform. The campaign was a huge success and I was free to produce an album I've always wanted to produce, free of financial constraints and creative limitations. That album was later titled 'Deliverance.' Well folks, it's been 5 years and I feel it's time to take another big leap of faith. I've been toying with the idea of creating another 'experimental album' for a year or two now. You see, it's not so easy piecing together an album like Colours or Deliverance and this decision wasn't easy to make. The truth is that crowdfunding is... Interesting. It's a vulnerable, nervous process and it's very humbling asking for support on this scale. What I will say though, is it's also incredible to witness how many crazy people out there relate to my music. And with your help you can help me write the next chapter.</p>

<div> </div>
</div><div>
<h3>This is an even bigger ask than the last campaign...</h3>
<p>It's a big goal I know. What you need to know is that the campaign has been put together in meticulous detail to ensure no money is wasted and every expense is accounted for. With that in mind I think it's really important to be completely transparent as to where your financial support will actually go. I won't bore you with the details and it's probably not all too surprising but the bulk of the costs are spent on Production Equipment, Software, Recording Costs, Post Production and of course manufacturing all of the Physical Products themselves. There's also several tons of Yorkshire Tea that need to be ordered and we haven't even talked about hobnobs yet. If you would like a detailed breakdown of the costs specifically, hit me up and I'll be happy to share them with you. </p>
<p>We've got some great perks on offer. In hindsight I wish we'd made more Deliverance vinyl as I still get messages now asking where people can cop it. Well... We're going to repress Deliverance. We're also going to go the extra mile with the new album, a double LP of the highest quality. For people still rocking CD players in their cars, we've got you covered. For my fellow producers out there, we've got you covered. For the Gregory Otterman's of the world, we've got you covered. There really is something for everyone and any contribution will be met with gratitude. Perhaps you're an up and coming producer and could use some tips? Perhaps you're keen on building your vinyl collection? Perhaps your a discogs warrior and you'll be the lot... </p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/F1x6GDy-688?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0"" style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""></iframe></div><p></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Turns out you guys really enjoyed Deliverance...</h3>
<p>It's amazing really. In fact it's bloody emotional. Some of the things I've read, some of the things I've been told me and some of the things I've seen, it's hard to articulate. I really want to deliver something on the same level but also something different. Is this album Deliverance 2? Not quite, it's in a similar vein. Think of it like this, this will be a sequel to Deliverance the same way Deliverance was a sequel to Colours. The thing is if the campaign is successfully funded then I can <i>fully </i>focus on creating something decent. I'm really proud of Deliverance but I'd put so much of the success down to the fact I wasn't limited. I didn't have to make compromises. It's been 5 years and a lot has changed. I need these funds to invest in the latest gizmos and give myself every chance of crafting an excellent product. No producer wants to have to use sub standard vocal mics or the wrong pre-amp. This campaign is all about excellence, otherwise, what's the point? </p>
<p>So why help out? Well, if you've come this far, you may be interested in the project or a fan of my previous works. My music is a bit out there and may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I like to think I'm doing something different and unique. You will be helping to create an album that will be nothing like you've heard before. I mean it won't be a million miles away from my previous productions, but I'll have the opportunity to create my best music to date. The last few years have been amazing and the fan base you guys have created has got me through the good times and the bad. I'm sitting here because of you and it still blows my mind that people pay for my music. I'm so blessed to be doing what I love doing everyday, and for all those reasons and more, i'm going to be pouring my heart and soul into the making of this album.</p>

<h3>This isn't going to be easy... </h3>
<p>The goal is massive. I know I'm asking a lot here. Especially when times are tough. The biggest risk here is if we don't manage to hit this goal. I wanted to keep the goal as low as possible, so we costed everything down to the final penny. This basically means if we don't hit the goal, they'll have to be some compromises, compromises I really don't want to make. There's also the elephant in the room that I'm going to have to take a lot of time off touring and bringing in revenue in other ways and with 2 kids to feed it's going to be a challenge. I'm actually hoping we can slightly go over the goal like we did before. That would be bloody terrific. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>There's lots of other things you can do to help...</h3>
<p>I get it, money is tight and you're just not in the position to contribute right now. Well, you can still help out, in fact there's a lot you can do. The success of this campaign is all about making noise. The more people that hear about it the more likely we are to succeed. Tell your mates, spread the word and get the campaign out there. Especially if you happen to be friends with a millionaire. Remember to use the Indiegogo share tools! </p>
<p>I'm still not sure what should go in this bit... So I'll put my social media deets here again. </p>

We're also going to go the extra mile with the new album, a double LP of the highest quality. For people still rocking CD players in their cars, we've got you covered. For my fellow producers out there, we've got you covered. For the Gregory Otterman's of the world, we've got you covered. There really is something for everyone and any contribution will be met with gratitude. Perhaps you're an up and coming producer and could use some tips? Perhaps you're keen on building your vinyl collection? Perhaps your a discogs warrior and you'll be the lot... 


Turns out you guys really enjoyed Deliverance...
It's amazing really. In fact it's bloody emotional. Some of the things I've read, some of the things I've been told me and some of the things I've seen, it's hard to articulate. I really want to deliver something on the same level but also something different. Is this album Deliverance 2? Not quite, it's in a similar vein. Think of it like this, this will be a sequel to Deliverance the same way Deliverance was a sequel to Colours. The thing is if the campaign is successfully funded then I can fully focus on creating something decent. I'm really proud of Deliverance but I'd put so much of the success down to the fact I wasn't limited. I didn't have to make compromises. It's been 5 years and a lot has changed. I need these funds to invest in the latest gizmos and give myself every chance of crafting an excellent product. No producer wants to have to use sub standard vocal mics or the wrong pre-amp. This campaign is all about excellence, otherwise, what's the point? 
So why help out? Well, if you've come this far, you may be interested in the project or a fan of my previous works. My music is a bit out there and may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I like to think I'm doing something different and unique. You will be helping to create an album that will be nothing like you've heard before. I mean it won't be a million miles away from my previous productions, but I'll have the opportunity to create my best music to date. The last few years have been amazing and the fan base you guys have created has got me through the good times and the bad. I'm sitting here because of you and it still blows my mind that people pay for my music. I'm so blessed to be doing what I love doing everyday, and for all those reasons and more, i'm going to be pouring my heart and soul into the making of this album.

 

This isn't going to be easy... 
The goal is massive. I know I'm asking a lot here. Especially when times are tough. The biggest risk here is if we don't manage to hit this goal. I wanted to keep the goal as low as possible, so we costed everything down to the final penny. This basically means if we don't hit the goal, they'll have to be some compromises, compromises I really don't want to make. There's also the elephant in the room that I'm going to have to take a lot of time off touring and bringing in revenue in other ways and with 2 kids to feed it's going to be a challenge. I'm actually hoping we can slightly go over the goal like we did before. That would be bloody terrific. 

There's lots of other things you can do to help...
I get it, money is tight and you're just not in the position to contribute right now. Well, you can still help out, in fact there's a lot you can do. The success of this campaign is all about making noise. The more people that hear about it the more likely we are to succeed. Tell your mates, spread the word and get the campaign out there. Especially if you happen to be friends with a millionaire. Remember to use the Indiegogo share tools! 
I'm still not sure what should go in this bit... So I'll put my social media deets here again.

<p><i>(Scrolle runter für die deutsche Version)</i></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>About me &amp; my idea</b><br/><br/>Hello there,</p><p>
Thanks for stopping by on the crowdfunding page for my first solo album.<br/>
My name is Kent Nielsen, I’m Danish but living in Lübeck (North Germany). My
resume includes: author, percussionist, shoe shop clerk, record label guy, mail
order honcho, night porter and ukulele player a. o. But there’s one thing I’ve
been doing for 35 years – and that’s singing.</p><p>Currently I’m about to complete an old project – my first solo album. I've long

</p><p><br/></p><p>
<b>Album, perks &amp; budget</b></p>
<p>
Roughly half of the roots-rock colored songs were written together with
Stefan Kletetzka (DEEP RIVER), some are brand new while a couple date back to the
time that Stefan and I played together in ONE BAR TOWN. Hence nothing seemed
more appropriate than getting our old rhythm section, Skinny Kaspereit and
Thorsten Luck, on board for that part of the recording sessions which took
place in Göttingen’s Out-O-Space Studios. Three covers were added, one by GLEN
CAMPBELL and another two originally written by EDDIE &amp; THE HOT RODS and
C.V. JØRGENSEN featuring my solo work on the ukulele. Three more songs,
drenched in Mod and 60s sounds were written together with Helge Reich (JAM
TODAY) and two musicians from his current band RUTSCHBAHN DREI, Jens C. Möller
and Dirk Holtkötter. This part of the recordings took place in Hamburg’s
Tonhotel Studio.</p>
<p>The album also includes guest
appearances from George Whitfield (FIDDLEBOX, ex-PRESSGANG) and Martin Wenk
(CALEXICO, NADA SURF, JUDITH HOLOFERNES). </p>

project ""Nicht allein!"" (“Not Alone!”).</p>
<p>“Not Alone!” is a new grass roots organization based in Lübeck, looking for
guardians for refugees who arrive here as minors without parents or other adult
relatives. The guardians are local citizens willing to help the children and
teenagers with legal and personal issues. For instance: support with submitting
applications for asylum, other obstacles they encounter in their new
surroundings or simply so that they do not feel completely alone or isolated.
At the moment such guardians are appointed by the authorities, some of them
have up to fifty youths to look after. It’s not hard to imagine what that means
for their daily work. The parent organization of “Not Alone!” is the Humanistic
Union of Lübeck. (Infos:

<br/>
While the subject of crowdfunding is relatively new to me, making music while
collecting money for a worthy cause isn’t. During my time as a label manager I
was involved in several successful benefit projects, for example: A therapy center
for traumatized women and children in Croatia, anticensorship campaign for the
Alpha Comic Books Publishing, the homeless in Germany and the Mohawk Revolt at
Kahnawake, Canada a. o.</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Current state of affairs</b><br/><br/>
All 14 songs have been recorded, 11 of those have been mixed, hence I’ve
gotten pretty far already. If we reach the campaign goal of EUR 5.500,- , the
final mix and mastering with my favorite producer is secured.<br/>
The only thing needed now is your support, in order to complete the album. What
follows after the studio is routines, that myself and the small but efficient
team behind me has exercised a number of times in the past.<br/>
<br/>
In the event that the campaign target isn’t reached, I will use any money
raised to make the best album I possibly can and all supporters will still
receive their perks.<br/>

an das in Planung befindliche Projekt „Nicht allein!“. „Nicht
allein“ sucht Vormundschaften für minderjährige Flüchtlinge die
alleine nach Lübeck kommen. Menschen, die bereit sind den

bedeutet Hilfe im Asylverfahren, Beistand im Alltag oder eben einfach
sie nicht alleine zu lassen. Momentan wird diese Unterstützung durch
Amtsvormundschaften geleistet, die jeweils bis zu 50 Jugendliche

vorstellen. „Nicht allein“ wird von der Humanistischen Union

Ich hoffe, dass uns ein Album gelungen ist, das so vielseitig und
abwechslungsreich ist wie ich sie selber am liebsten mag.Das
Ziel dieser Crowdfunding Kampagne ist es genügend Unterstützer zu
finden um den finalen Mix, Artwork und die CD Pressung zu
finanzieren.Album,
Perks & BudgetEtwa
die Hälfte der Roots Rock gefärbten Songs wurden zusammen mit
Stefan Kletetzka (DEEP RIVER) geschrieben, davon sind einige sind
ganz neu, und ein paar stammen aus unserer gemeinsamer Zeit bei ONE
BAR TOWN. Es war also naheliegend, unsere alten Bandkollegen Skinny
Kaspereit und Thorsten Luck für diesen Teil der Aufnahmen in Tom
Spötters Göttinger Out-O-Space Studio zu reaktivieren. Hinzu kommen
drei Cover, eines von GLEN CAMPBELL und zwei weitere von EDDIE &
THE HOT RODS und C.V. JØRGENSEN, die ich alleine auf der Ukulele neu
interpretiert habe. Die letzten drei, in Mod & 60s Sound
getränkten Titel, entstanden in Zusammenarbeit mit Helge Reich (JAM
TODAY) und zwei Musikern aus dessen aktueller Band RUTSCHBAHN DREI,
Jens C. Möller und Dirk Holtkötter. Dieser Teil der Aufnahmen
liefen im Hamburger Tonhotel Studio unter der Regie von Gerd Mauff.
Abgerundet wird das Album durch Gastauftritte von George Whitfield
(FIDDLEBOX, ex-PRESSGANG) und Martin Wenk (CALEXICO, BOSSE, JUDITH
HOLOFERNES).Und
jetzt zum spaßigen Teil. Ich habe mir jede Menge witzige Perks
einfallen lassen als Gegenleistung für Eure Unterstützung. Vom
einfachen Download, signierte CDs, handgeschriebene Lyric Sheets,
über exklusive Fanpakete, bis hin zum intimen Akustik Konzert in
Deinen eigenen vier Wänden. Klicke
auf ein bestimmten „Perk“ und werde Teil des Ganzen.

Der
Benefiz Aspekt
Ab
dem Punkt, an dem das Mindestziel erreicht wird, geht der Überschuss
an das in Planung befindliche Projekt „Nicht allein!“. „Nicht
allein“ sucht Vormundschaften für minderjährige Flüchtlinge die
alleine nach Lübeck kommen. Menschen, die bereit sind den
Jugendlichen bei rechtlichen und persönlichen Dingen zu helfen. Das
bedeutet Hilfe im Asylverfahren, Beistand im Alltag oder eben einfach
sie nicht alleine zu lassen. Momentan wird diese Unterstützung durch
Amtsvormundschaften geleistet, die jeweils bis zu 50 Jugendliche
gleichzeitig betreuen. Was das bedeutet kann man sich unschwer
vorstellen. „Nicht allein“ wird von der Humanistischen Union
Lübeck initiiert. (Infos: katja.mentz (a) gmx.de
www.humanistische-union.de/regionen/luebeck)Das
Thema Crowdfunding ist zwar relatives Neuland für mich, Musik machen
und gleichzeitig Geld sammeln für einen guten Zweck dagegen nicht.
Während meine Zeit als Label Chef war ich in einigen sehr
erfolgreiche Benefizprojekte involviert, u.a.: für ein
Therapiezentrum für traumatisierten Frauen und Kinder in Kroatien,
Prozesskosten für den vom Staatsanwaltschaft lahm gelegten Alpha
Comic Verlag, Obdachlose in Deutschland oder vom Staat drangsalierten
Ureinwohner in Kanada. Stand
der Dinge Alle
14 Songs sind bereits fertig aufgenommen, 11 davon auch schon
gemischt, wir sind also schon ziemlich weit. Wenn das Ziel von EUR
5.000,- erreicht wird, wären der endgültige Mix und das Mastern bei
meinem Wunschproduzenten gesichert. Was jetzt noch fehlt ist also
das Wichtigste, nämlich Deine Unterstützung, damit das Album fertig
stellen werden kann. Was danach kommt sind Abläufe die ich, und das
kleine aber feine Team hinter mir, schon oft durchexerziert haben.
Sollte
das Mindestziel jedoch nicht erreicht werden, werde ich trotzdem mit
dem eingenommenen Geld das bestmögliche Album machen, und alle
Unterstützer werden ihre Perks erhalten.Wie
Du sonst noch helfen kannst Die
Zeiten sind hart, und vielleicht hast Du keine Möglichkeit mein
Projekt finanziell zu unterstützen? Helfen kannst Du dennoch, und
zwar indem Du deinen Freunden & Bekannten auf Deinen Social Media
Sites über dieses Projekt erzählst. Bitte nutze dafür das Tool
von Indiegogo.Liebe GrüßeKent",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<br/><strong>Be Free</strong> - narrates how in those early days of the first lockdown when the sun shone, the pace slowed and many began to reflect on the possibility of changing how we live and the connection that developed through this united global experience.<br/><br/><strong>Be A Little Kinder </strong>- I wrote this around the same time as Be Free when I was exploring the question 'Can we treat this world a little better, can we be a little kinder, can we take a little less and give a little more?'<br/><br/><strong>Peace Inside</strong> -  A nod to the track GOLD from The Liminal, a song like Peace Inside, that invites us to remind us all that 'when the darkness takes a hold just remember the gold within you'. <br/><br/><strong>Carries Me Home</strong>  - a love song that shares the journey of finding the balance between loving another and connecting to the love within.</div><div> </div><div>
<strong>Heart Sutra &amp; Gayatri Mantra</strong> -  I have recorded solo versions of these mantras but adding the harp &amp; double bass just takes these tracks to a whole other level, so I have decided to include them in this album.  The Heart Sutra is a mantra that translates as 'Go go far beyond to where the wisdom lies', whilst the Gayatri can be translated as ' You, who  are the source of all power, whose rays illuminate the whole world, illuminate also my heart so that it too can do your work'. <br/><br/>The below video of the Heart Sutra was filmed at Medicine Festival during the Closing Cacao Ceremony.</div><p> </p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LLubvQ82zsU?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><p><strong>PRACTICAL BITS....

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Who We Are</h2>
<p>Hi! <strong>We are Ada and Nathan, the creators of <i>Wakes</i> and the musicians behind our two musical projects <i>Nada Wakes</i> and <i>She Wakes</i>.</strong> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580703909/vzgfqlci8tnafkmn6xcn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have been singing and writing music together since we met Christmas caroling and it’s been an integral part of our lives for much longer than that. Music has been our personal therapist and friend since we were very young, helping us to better understand ourselves, process emotions, and navigate our life circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Both the healing and storytelling aspects of music compelled us to spend the past 2 years touring and sharing </strong>both our <strong>sound healing</strong> (Nada Wakes) and <strong>folk music</strong> (She Wakes) in yoga studios, homes, cafes, festivals, fundraisers, foreign countries and anywhere else we could. </p>
<p>We built out our van, Baby Beluga, to make it easier (and cheaper) to <strong>get on the road and share our music so that it might help others as much as it’s helped us. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580750824/yjczsybezycni3rsirlo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">From the Road to the Studio</h3>
<p><strong>Our passion for music and the power it holds to create powerful psychological, emotional, physical and spiritual shifts in our lives is why we are reaching out to ask for you help.</strong> </p>
<p>We’ve spent all this time sharing our music in live settings, but <strong>now it's time to record it</strong> so that we can make this incredible tool available to more people (you!) at any time, any place, to use however it best serves them (you!)! </p>

<ol>
<li>
<strong>Nada Wakes: Journey Through the Chakras - $18 - $25</strong><ul><li>Our signature sound journey for deep meditation and listening within. Inspired by the wisdom of the chakra system and the beauty of the journey of human development. Original mantras are sung atop various world instruments like harmonium, guitar, bansuri flute, RAV Vast steel drum, didgeridoo, crystal bowls and more to create a moving soundscape with which to immerse yourself into. These songs will light you up, balance and calm, tap into the subconscious, and teach you about yourself through the power of sound and vibration, male and female vocal harmony, and transportive lyrics. Perfect for processing emotions, tapping into your potential, accessing creativity, silencing mind chatter, and drifting to deep sleep. Each track is between 10-15 minutes and can be used as a single meditation session or can be listened to in its entirety for a deeper and longer dive into the sound journey as it was originally written.  <div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/wSffnggCkbE"" width=""560""></iframe></div>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>She Wakes: Beginnings - $12 - $18</strong><ul><li>These are the songs that have accompanied and carried us through the many joys and storms of life. Songs full of the stories of the finer and tougher moments. Songs that explore the themes of blossoming love, the end of life, commitment, sickness, sexuality, silly arguments and more. Folky, jazz-inspired sounds full of vulnerability, gorgeous harmony, and lyrics worth a second and third listen.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>She Wakes: Covers Album - $10 - $15</strong><ul><li>An album of some of our (and hopefully YOUR) favorite songs. Many from our New Song November Challenge! In 2018 we learned, arranged, performed, and posted a song EVERY DAY to Youtube. You can watch them <u><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNuarakt9ruOHg62xtLv6XX9KwmgIy3oz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</u> We'll be doing a proper recording, mix and master of ~12 songs.</li></ul>

The back side of the card has some information about one energy center of the body, some encouragement, and a provoking question or practice to open this part of you a little more. If you have experienced the Journey through the Chakras music event, or heard any of the songs, you can use these cards as a memory of your experience and to deepen your practice. Even if you’ve never heard the music, the power of mantra in repeating and meditating on these words is still potent.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Testimonials</h2>
<p>Over the last 4 years, playing our music from Costa Rica to Sweden, touring from San Diego to our home town of Wenatchee Washington, the words of encouragement we’ve received has kept us going…especially when the self-doubt and fear of putting ourselves out there creeps into our psyches. </p>
<p><strong>We know how powerful this music is, and have been affirmed of it by tears and hugs and appreciation across cultures and around the world. But hey, if you don’t want to take our word for it, we hope you will take theirs. </strong></p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Why We Need Your Help</h2>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The nitty gritty of how we'll spend the money</h3>
<p>Our goal is ambitious! 3 albums to capture all of the songs and musical experiences we have been creating and sharing over these past 4 years. However <strong>the recording process is time intensive and costly.</strong> You can help us bring this dream to life by pre-ordering the music. It provides the monetary cushion we need to stop our other paying work, like touring and videography (our side hustle), and finish the recording process that we’ve already started!</p>
<p>To save money this time around we are doing the recording ourselves with the highest quality recording equipment that we have access too. <strong>We’ve already invested thousands in equipment, but our main barrier up to this point with recording has been covering our time. Time in the studio takes us away from paying work.</strong></p>
<p>We constantly get asked (by many of you, thank you!) if our music is available to purchase or listen to online. <strong>By supporting us with your pre-order, you help us cover the cost of hunkering down</strong>, and that means at the end we can finally say to people who ask, YES, here it all is!</p>
<h3>Here is an estimate of the time &amp; costs we need to get this music made:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Time + Additional Costs (eg. Extra Equipment, Guest Artists) = ~$5,000</li>
<li>Mix &amp; Master 30 songs x $150 per song = ~$4,500</li>
<li>Printing &amp; Manufacturing Physical Products = ~$500</li>
<li>Worldwide Distribution for Streaming Online = ~$300</li>
<li>Licensing for Cover Songs = ~$450</li>
<li>Marketing Budget = ~$500</li>
<li><strong>TOTAL = $11,250</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We've decided to round this to an even $10,000 and hope to reach for some stretch goals!</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Stretch goals and what they’re for.</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>If we reach $15,000 we will create a <strong>guided meditation album with original music and words for various life circumstances</strong> like falling asleep, sitting in traffic, calming anxiety, and more!</li>
<li>If we reach $20,000 we will create a <strong>2nd sound journey called Somatic Sound that will have accompanying yoga postures</strong> paired with the musical meditations. </li>
</ul>
<p>We made this fundraiser a <strong>flexible funding goal</strong>, because any amount you contribute will help us achieve our goal, and it is one we are committed to regardless. If we don’t make our goal, we’ll scope our ambitions and maybe record one album at a time rather than all at once. It will probably take longer, and we’ll need to focus on other paid projects in-between. But, we’re confident that no matter how much we raise, this music will get recorded. Because we believe in it! And it’s that important to us to share with others. <strong>Basically, the more you back us, the more we’ll create! </strong></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<div>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Impact!</h2>
<p>If it wasn't clear already, we hope the impacts of this campaign will be felt far and wide. <strong>You will not only help us achieve our dream of getting this music recorded, you will be giving yourself the gift of music! Plus you will ensure that countless other people can listen to it as well.</strong> </p>
<p>We know this music makes a difference. <strong>It unlocks feelings that we repress, it calms our anxieties and fears, it brings a smile to our face when we feel down.</strong></p>
<p>We believe listening to music in this intentional way, <strong>facilitates greater mindfulness and awareness</strong>, and THAT is a powerful, radical act in our world! When we can be with our thoughts and feelings and nurture what is moving within us, <strong>we can be more empowered and fulfilled people who make a difference in the world. </strong></p>
<p>That is why Wakes tag line is <strong>“Listen to what’s within, share it with the world.”</strong> We believe this music will truly help you get “calm, creative, and courageous” and compel you to actualize your fullest potential. </p>
<p><strong>Also, science has shown soooo many benefits. Music (especially music we like) helps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>enhance our mood and regulate our emotions (often through the release of dopamine)</li>
<li>reduce stress</li>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The Mission of Wakes</h2>
<p>To really drive the point home, beyond making this specific music, we have a larger mission we are working towards. After creating separately under our two different names for two years, we realized that there is a common theme! Yes, that’s right, the word Wakes ;) But you get it, the deeper meaning for us is that <strong>no matter the genre, music wakes us up to life, to ourselves, and to each other.</strong> It helps us to listen to ourselves, to truly tune-in, and it can work at a level that is beyond the rational mind to <strong>heal what hurts, move stuck energy, and unleash our potential. </strong></p>
<p>What we care about most is <strong>helping people to awaken to the meaning, purpose, and power of ALL parts of their life</strong>, from the most glorious to the most challenging. We do that <strong>through music, mindfulness and community, live events and retreats.</strong> By contributing today you help us extend that mission to include more audio recordings that can awaken more people to the presence and power within them.</p>
<p><strong>We believe music is medicine and a key to the resilience that we need in these challenging times.</strong> Life is increasingly stressful, disrupted and divided. Yet music moves us, it unites! It is an underestimated force for good. And <strong>i</strong><strong>t can change our minds and hearts, and world, for the better.</strong> </p>

There's More to Music Than Meets the Ear.
Music can change lives. We've seen it first hand.
Again and again, at every concert and music event we play, people leave different, better, more aware, lighter, and more empowered than they came in.
This crowdfunding campaign and Wakes is about more than just making a few albums. It's about empowering people to be their best selves. 
Get the music, support the cause, awaken your brightest life!
 
Who We Are
Hi! We are Ada and Nathan, the creators of Wakes and the musicians behind our two musical projects Nada Wakes and She Wakes. 
 

 
We have been singing and writing music together since we met Christmas caroling and it’s been an integral part of our lives for much longer than that. Music has been our personal therapist and friend since we were very young, helping us to better understand ourselves, process emotions, and navigate our life circumstances.
Both the healing and storytelling aspects of music compelled us to spend the past 2 years touring and sharing both our sound healing (Nada Wakes) and folk music (She Wakes) in yoga studios, homes, cafes, festivals, fundraisers, foreign countries and anywhere else we could. 
We built out our van, Baby Beluga, to make it easier (and cheaper) to get on the road and share our music so that it might help others as much as it’s helped us. 
 

 
From the Road to the Studio
Our passion for music and the power it holds to create powerful psychological, emotional, physical and spiritual shifts in our lives is why we are reaching out to ask for you help. 
We’ve spent all this time sharing our music in live settings, but now it's time to record it so that we can make this incredible tool available to more people (you!) at any time, any place, to use however it best serves them (you!)! 
 
THE MUSIC WE'RE MAKING!
(YOUR PERKS)



 
Your contribution will sponsor the production of 3 albums


Nada Wakes: Journey Through the Chakras - $18 - $25Our signature sound journey for deep meditation and listening within. Inspired by the wisdom of the chakra system and the beauty of the journey of human development. Original mantras are sung atop various world instruments like harmonium, guitar, bansuri flute, RAV Vast steel drum, didgeridoo, crystal bowls and more to create a moving soundscape with which to immerse yourself into. These songs will light you up, balance and calm, tap into the subconscious, and teach you about yourself through the power of sound and vibration, male and female vocal harmony, and transportive lyrics. Perfect for processing emotions, tapping into your potential, accessing creativity, silencing mind chatter, and drifting to deep sleep. Each track is between 10-15 minutes and can be used as a single meditation session or can be listened to in its entirety for a deeper and longer dive into the sound journey as it was originally written.  



She Wakes: Beginnings - $12 - $18These are the songs that have accompanied and carried us through the many joys and storms of life. Songs full of the stories of the finer and tougher moments. Songs that explore the themes of blossoming love, the end of life, commitment, sickness, sexuality, silly arguments and more. Folky, jazz-inspired sounds full of vulnerability, gorgeous harmony, and lyrics worth a second and third listen.


She Wakes: Covers Album - $10 - $15An album of some of our (and hopefully YOUR) favorite songs. Many from our New Song November Challenge! In 2018 we learned, arranged, performed, and posted a song EVERY DAY to Youtube. You can watch them here. We'll be doing a proper recording, mix and master of ~12 songs.

Testimonials
Over the last 4 years, playing our music from Costa Rica to Sweden, touring from San Diego to our home town of Wenatchee Washington, the words of encouragement we’ve received has kept us going…especially when the self-doubt and fear of putting ourselves out there creeps into our psyches. 
We know how powerful this music is, and have been affirmed of it by tears and hugs and appreciation across cultures and around the world. But hey, if you don’t want to take our word for it, we hope you will take theirs. 


""A journey through sound and introspection like I’ve never experienced. If medicine started prescribing music, it would be this."" Scott W. / Pittsburgh, PA


""The most tender and sweet music I have ever heard.""Nandy E. /  San Jose, Costa Rica


""Such an amazing and beautiful musical experience. I don't think I've ever felt so peaceful.""Toni F. / Brighton, United Kingdom


""One of the most beautiful experiences that I have ever had. It was such an emotional sensory explosion. I left feeling amazing.""Heidi W. / Clarkston, WA


""This experience was transformative. I was able to go places in my mind that I would ordinarily try to avoid as a protective mechanism. This experience opened me up to a heightened degree of acceptance and love. Truly curative. Truly beautiful.""Tricia O. / Walla Walla, WA


""I have been listening for a week now and noticed a difference. I've never been able to slow down and meditate before but I can now!""Patty K. / Wenatchee WA

Why We Need Your Help
The nitty gritty of how we'll spend the money
Our goal is ambitious! 3 albums to capture all of the songs and musical experiences we have been creating and sharing over these past 4 years. However the recording process is time intensive and costly. You can help us bring this dream to life by pre-ordering the music. It provides the monetary cushion we need to stop our other paying work, like touring and videography (our side hustle), and finish the recording process that we’ve already started!
To save money this time around we are doing the recording ourselves with the highest quality recording equipment that we have access too. We’ve already invested thousands in equipment, but our main barrier up to this point with recording has been covering our time. Time in the studio takes us away from paying work.
We constantly get asked (by many of you, thank you!) if our music is available to purchase or listen to online. By supporting us with your pre-order, you help us cover the cost of hunkering down, and that means at the end we can finally say to people who ask, YES, here it all is!
Here is an estimate of the time & costs we need to get this music made:

Time + Additional Costs (eg. Extra Equipment, Guest Artists) = ~$5,000
Mix & Master 30 songs x $150 per song = ~$4,500
Printing & Manufacturing Physical Products = ~$500
Worldwide Distribution for Streaming Online = ~$300
Licensing for Cover Songs = ~$450
Marketing Budget = ~$500
TOTAL = $11,250

We've decided to round this to an even $10,000 and hope to reach for some stretch goals!
Stretch goals and what they’re for.

If we reach $15,000 we will create a guided meditation album with original music and words for various life circumstances like falling asleep, sitting in traffic, calming anxiety, and more!
If we reach $20,000 we will create a 2nd sound journey called Somatic Sound that will have accompanying yoga postures paired with the musical meditations. 

We made this fundraiser a flexible funding goal, because any amount you contribute will help us achieve our goal, and it is one we are committed to regardless. If we don’t make our goal, we’ll scope our ambitions and maybe record one album at a time rather than all at once. It will probably take longer, and we’ll need to focus on other paid projects in-between. But, we’re confident that no matter how much we raise, this music will get recorded. Because we believe in it! And it’s that important to us to share with others. Basically, the more you back us, the more we’ll create! 
 

Impact!
If it wasn't clear already, we hope the impacts of this campaign will be felt far and wide. You will not only help us achieve our dream of getting this music recorded, you will be giving yourself the gift of music! Plus you will ensure that countless other people can listen to it as well. 
We know this music makes a difference. It unlocks feelings that we repress, it calms our anxieties and fears, it brings a smile to our face when we feel down.
We believe listening to music in this intentional way, facilitates greater mindfulness and awareness, and THAT is a powerful, radical act in our world! When we can be with our thoughts and feelings and nurture what is moving within us, we can be more empowered and fulfilled people who make a difference in the world. 
That is why Wakes tag line is “Listen to what’s within, share it with the world.” We believe this music will truly help you get “calm, creative, and courageous” and compel you to actualize your fullest potential. 
Also, science has shown soooo many benefits. Music (especially music we like) helps:

enhance our mood and regulate our emotions (often through the release of dopamine)
reduce stress
lessen anxiety and depression
improve memory
increase focus and attention
induce a meditative state
promote creativity and “divergent” thinking (a key to complex problem solving)
ease physical pain
enhance communication and ability to express feelings
improve cognition
boost physical performance and endurance
improve heart health (lowers blood pressure, reduces heart rate, decreases cortisol, and increases endorphins and serotonin levels)
improve sleep quality
those with alzheimer’s, autism spectrum disorder, stroke, cancer, and hospice patients, and premature babies

<h3><strong>Short Summary</strong></h3>
<p>I'm a performing songwriter from Houston, Texas.  I have played hundreds of shows in the US, Canada, and Europe and released 5 records in the last 11 years.  My favorite thing in the world is to share stories and songs in intimate listening environments so that I can connect with the human beings in that room.  I also love the collaborative process of bringing my songs to life in the studio so that the music can be shared with those that I might not be able to connect with face to face.   </p>
<p>Since my last record was released in 2019, I have built up a group of a few dozen new songs.  Late last year I started making plans to take some of those songs into the studio.   I got together with a community of artists and engineers who I love and admire with the intention of making a record that inspires people to connect with their best self, which I feel is my job as an artist.  Our mission was to create an album that people return to time and time again to be inspired.  Each song would strive for deep resonance with the listener.   The collection would create an oasis of sound and experience that is fresh and familiar, one that the folks would want to return to.  To make a long story short, I believe that we succeeded in accomplishing our mission! </p>
<p>I named the record “The Love in You”, the title of one of the songs.  From the time we got together in Austin, TX in March of this year to lay down the basic tracks, and over the next six months as we added elements, and finished up the mixes, we put every bit of the love in us into this project.  Now, I will try to connect with the love in you as I ask you to help me with the substantial costs of getting this record out in the world.   Will you join me in the campaign to launch “The Love In You” into the world?  Following are the details of how we can partner to make it all happen. </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>Using crowdfunding as the funding mechanism and Indiegogo as a platform,  I have tried to put together some attractive incentives to reward you for joining with me to make the vision and mission for this record a reality. I have outlined and prioritized those costs in the written section below so that you know what your contributions will be used for.   </p>
<p>So what are the costs and how will we fund them? Over the past two years of touring, I have saved and invested enough to finance the recording, mixing, and mastering of the record myself as well as a budget for video production.  A very special patron has committed to fund the photography, artwork and design for the CD and merchandise, some video production, and the cost of campaign related Indiegogo fees, postage, and merchandise. This campaign will aim to raise the remaining $11,500 which are for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publicity, USA - $4,500</li>
<li>Publicity and Radio Promotion, Europe - $3,500</li>
<li>Radio Promotion, USA - $3,500</li>
</ul>
<p>As a campaign supporter, you will be able to listen to the record as soon as it is mastered, well before the February 1, 2022 official release date.  You will also have access to all the cool perks listed on the campaign page.  </p>
<p>Because this campaign is set up for Flex Funding,  we will still get to keep the funds even if we don’t reach the entire campaign goal.  Funds raised will be used in the order listed above starting with USA Publicity and moving down from there.  Funds beyond the campaign goal will be used to fund additional video releases.   It is up to you to decide how far we stretch, but we will get this record out into the world no matter what!</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My artistic  journey has been a progression.  Every record and subsequent tour has given me the opportunity to interact with more and more people all over the world. I still remember the shows and faces with fondness.  So many messages of support and gratitude.  So many moments of beauty, and magic that have lifted me up,  and that I will never forget.  </p>
<p>I remember the Vietnam vet in Montague, Michigan who told me, with tears in his eyes,  about the buddies in his platoon that  he had lost.  The elderly lady in Ouddorp, Netherlands who told me that she had never had so much fun at a concert.  The attorney in San Antonio who told me that my show had inspired her to write poetry again.  The countless times that the audience sang along with me, singing the lyrics word for word.  These memories make me feel that songs do make a positive difference and that sharing them is the right thing to do.   My producer,  Walt Wilkins, commented just the other day, “Jordi, think of all the times your music has inspired others that you will never know about.” </p>
<p>I hope these thoughts will help you understand that your hard earned contributions will empower this project to inspire listeners in your own communities and in distant corners of the world. You will give “The Love in You” a chance at a long life that makes a difference for years to come.</p>

<p>There are non-financial ways to contribute to the campaign.  Whether you are able to contribute financially or not, please consider sharing the campaign with your family and friends.   You can forward a campaign email or share this page via social media so that we can reach corners of the world that I could never reach alone.  There are shareable links located in the section in the top right corner of this page.   I hope that you will partner with me to bring ""The Love in You"" to as many people as might benefit from its medicine.   Thanks for spreading the love!</p>
</div><p> </p></div>","Short Summary
I'm a performing songwriter from Houston, Texas.  I have played hundreds of shows in the US, Canada, and Europe and released 5 records in the last 11 years.  My favorite thing in the world is to share stories and songs in intimate listening environments so that I can connect with the human beings in that room.  I also love the collaborative process of bringing my songs to life in the studio so that the music can be shared with those that I might not be able to connect with face to face.   
Since my last record was released in 2019, I have built up a group of a few dozen new songs.  Late last year I started making plans to take some of those songs into the studio.   I got together with a community of artists and engineers who I love and admire with the intention of making a record that inspires people to connect with their best self, which I feel is my job as an artist.  Our mission was to create an album that people return to time and time again to be inspired.  Each song would strive for deep resonance with the listener.   The collection would create an oasis of sound and experience that is fresh and familiar, one that the folks would want to return to.  To make a long story short, I believe that we succeeded in accomplishing our mission! 
I named the record “The Love in You”, the title of one of the songs.  From the time we got together in Austin, TX in March of this year to lay down the basic tracks, and over the next six months as we added elements, and finished up the mixes, we put every bit of the love in us into this project.  Now, I will try to connect with the love in you as I ask you to help me with the substantial costs of getting this record out in the world.   Will you join me in the campaign to launch “The Love In You” into the world?  Following are the details of how we can partner to make it all happen. 
What We Need & What You Get
Using crowdfunding as the funding mechanism and Indiegogo as a platform,  I have tried to put together some attractive incentives to reward you for joining with me to make the vision and mission for this record a reality. I have outlined and prioritized those costs in the written section below so that you know what your contributions will be used for.   
So what are the costs and how will we fund them? Over the past two years of touring, I have saved and invested enough to finance the recording, mixing, and mastering of the record myself as well as a budget for video production.  A very special patron has committed to fund the photography, artwork and design for the CD and merchandise, some video production, and the cost of campaign related Indiegogo fees, postage, and merchandise. This campaign will aim to raise the remaining $11,500 which are for the following:

Publicity, USA - $4,500
Publicity and Radio Promotion, Europe - $3,500
Radio Promotion, USA - $3,500

As a campaign supporter, you will be able to listen to the record as soon as it is mastered, well before the February 1, 2022 official release date.  You will also have access to all the cool perks listed on the campaign page.  
Because this campaign is set up for Flex Funding,  we will still get to keep the funds even if we don’t reach the entire campaign goal.  Funds raised will be used in the order listed above starting with USA Publicity and moving down from there.  Funds beyond the campaign goal will be used to fund additional video releases.   It is up to you to decide how far we stretch, but we will get this record out into the world no matter what!

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Jazz harpist and vocalist Tara Minton, and double bassist Ed Babar have been playing and touring together for eight years. Over that time they have developed a rare musical partnership, honed over countless hours rehearsing, travelling throughout the UK and Europe and playing music to audiences great and small. In April 2021 they recorded an intimate duo album titled ""Two For The Road"", recorded over three days at Lightship 95 studio at Trinity Buoy Wharf. The record is produced by Geoff Gascoyne and features guest performances by Stan Sulzmann and Lilia Ioncheva. </p>
<p>The album explores the relationship and interplay between harp, voice and double bass through an honest and articulate presentation of standards from the Great American Songbook and the modern British jazz canon, </p>
<p>The goal of this campaign is to raise funds to produce CD's and a music book of arrangements and transcriptions from the record - a valuable resource for students of jazz harp and double bass. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Tara has received many requests over the years for sheet music of her arrangements, but has always felt it went against the nature of what it means to play jazz music.

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Both Tara and Ed feel uncomfortable asking for financial assistance, but to promote an album properly and produce high quality CDs and Music Books takes considerable funds up front.

<p><strong>THANK YOU</strong> to everyone who has contributed to this campaign and spread the word! I'm beyond grateful for the support and excited to finish and share this album with you. <strong>Haven't contributed yet?</strong> We're now in Indiegogo's ""InDemand"" phase, so <strong>there's still time</strong>! <u>To back the project, just click on the perk you'd like to purchase and follow the prompts to the check-out</u>. There are many expenses involved in making this (and any) album [recording, mixing, mastering, musicians, studio fees, artwork/graphic design, vinyl and CD manufacturing, digital distribution, video(s), press and radio campaigns, etc.], so every bit raised will help defray my costs and go toward the categories above. <strong>Join the 260+ backers and grab a pre-order or other reward, and thank you, <i>and</i> welcome aboard <i>Holidays in United States</i></strong>! We're in it (everything, that is) together.</p>
<p>Check out the full summary and project details below.</p>
<h3><u>Summary</u></h3>
<p>Hello and thanks for stopping by! My name's Adam Klein and I'm a singer/songwriter and actor from Athens, Georgia, now living in the Atlanta area (Tucker, GA, to be exact.)</p>
<p>I'm raising funds and hoping to partner with YOU to bring my next album to life.  The album is called <i>Holidays in United States</i> and the songs grapple with this monumental moment in American history, our past, and our inequities. This album is my response and document of these historic times, and my contribution in song to movements toward equity, greater social justice, and healing in America and beyond.</p>
<p>A number of the songs were written after the killing of George Floyd, and I later realized that some other songs I had sitting around were expressions and stories of hurting, unfulfilled American lives. I think they sit together nicely to make a statement about the many faces, lives, and landscapes that are a part of the American experience. </p>
<p>We hearken back to my youthful days enjoying the music scene and laid back lifestyle of my hometown. We find ourselves on ships battered by cold winds upon the high seas searching for a welcoming place to land. We head west and follow a lone cowboy straight outta Cormac McCarthy's ""Border Trilogy"" brooding over the passage of time. And we face longstanding divisions in our society which separate us and fracture our long-held complacency. The title is certainly tongue-in-cheek, but I hope that through it all we find our common humanity and a place at the table for all people in the American story. </p>
<p>Your contributions will mean the world to me and help me tell these stories through song and bring them out into the world. I'll leave it to others to judge, but I consider this collection one of my strongest and most important records. These songs are a stance— my perspective, my expressions of heartbreak and solidarity, and my deep yearning that we may create a better, more just society.  <strong>Your pre-orders will help present this vision to music listeners around the world</strong>.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>The Details</u></h3>
<p>As a singer/songwriter without label support, a manager, or a built-in team advancing my music, I fund the entirety of the album recording and release process. For this album, that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grammy-nominated engineer and producer Will Robertson and his studio fees for our covid-friendly recording session in Atlanta </li>
<li>My longstanding engineer/producer Bronson Tew's time and studio fees. (Bronson has taken and built upon the initial recordings. He'll also play on, mix, and master the album. This is his handiwork as well.) </li>
<li>Payment for all musicians (~$5,000)</li>
<li>CD manufacturing (~$2,000)</li>
<li>Vinyl manufacturing (~$2,600)</li>
<li>Digital distribution &amp; copyrighting (~$200)</li>
<li>2 videos (~$1,750)</li>
<li>All promo to help get the songs out into the world, find an audience, and work to build a broader profile and viable career [Some publicists are ~$2,000 - $3,000/month for a 2 or 3 month minimum; folk/Americana radio promoters may charge ~$3,000+ per campaign. European radio campaign typically costs ~$1,500+, etc.]</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3><u>The Perks</u></h3>
<p>I'm offering some one-of-a-kind perks, including: </p>
<ul>
<li>7"" lathe-cut vinyl records which represent the sole physical copy of a number of unreleased songs </li>
<li>test pressings of the <i>Holidays in United States</i> and <i>Sky Blue DeVille</i> vinyl</li>
<li>t-shirts, records, and CDs</li>
<li>one-on-one songwriting workshops</li>
<li>I'll write and record a personalized song just for you </li>
<li>solo acoustic house concert</li>
<li>post-pandemic Adam Klein &amp; The Wild Fires band show (within the southeast or a reasonable distance beyond) </li>
<li>Updates on the status of the album and first listens to the mixes and final masters!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>First and foremost, the funds will help offset the costs of the recording— the producers/engineers, studio time, and musician fees. I have always been fortunate to get to play and record with incredibly talented and generous musicians and friends who care deeply about the project and material and play for very friendly rates. Nonetheless, it of course adds up. Additional money raised will go toward the manufacturing of the CDs (which, believe it or not, people still buy, and are a key part of getting the album out in pr and radio campaigns) and the vinyl. Anything beyond that will go toward the costs of a publicist and radio promoter. With few exceptions, most everyone whose music you've heard and loved who has a regional or national platform has had to invest heavily in PR and Radio efforts. Unfortunately, it usually costs money to build a viable career and achieve the status of having your music known and generating income. I am a modest guy, and mostly fulfilled with creating works that I think are valuable and strong, but I would still like to have a broader audience and the satisfaction of greater recognition amongst folk and Americana music lovers worldwide.  I'm certainly not on many listeners' radar. I think this album deserves the public's awareness and a place at the table with other social-oriented albums of this era (and folk/Americana releases in general). </p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>The Impact</u></h3>
<p>As you can tell, <strong>your pre-orders, perk purchases and support of this project will bring an album that is timely and dear to my heart into the world properly</strong>. It's not my first go-round— this will be my 8th released album, and I have another album already recorded (but not yet mixed or mastered) and others written but unrecorded. My music has garnered praise and coverage from a range of outlets including Flagpole Magazine, American Songwriter, The Bluegrass Situation, Huffington Post, NPR, Paste, Peace Corps' Worldview Magazine, and plenty of Americana blogs worldwide. It's also gotten traction on radio in the U.S., Europe and Australia. </p>
<p>I'm proud of the collaborators on my records, which includes friends and top notch musicians such as David Blackmon, Randall Bramblett, Crash Cason, Stuart Cole (Squirrel Nut Zippers), Jay Gonzalez (Drive-By Truckers), Robert Bret Hartley, Lera Lynn, Raphael McGregor, John Neff, Carlton Owens (Cracker), Matt Patton (Drive-By Truckers), and Bronson Tew.</p>
<p>On stage, I've been fortunate to play shows with a range of fantastic bands and songwriters. A short list includes James McMurtry, Josh Ritter, Shovels &amp; Rope, Kevn Kinney, Abigail Washburn &amp; the Sparrow Quartet featuring Bela Fleck, Jimbo Mathus, Shawn Mullins, Jim Lauderdale, Robert Ellis, Steep Canyon Rangers, Okkervil River, Larkin Poe, and Jonathan Byrd. </p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>Risks &amp; Challenges</u></h3>
<p>The main challenge in actualizing this album as detailed above is finding sufficient funding to cover all aspects of the release. Here's the thing: At the baseline level, this album <i>will</i> get completed and released. This means mixed, mastered, manufactured to CDs, and digitally distributed. It's a whole lot of money to do even these steps, and I'm hoping to offset the costs with your support of this campaign. That will benefit myself and my family so we don't take a big loss on the effort. Beyond that, getting the word out and having an opportunity for the album to make an impact and further my music career plus pressing vinyl for vinyl lovers to purchase and fully experience the album costs another pretty penny. So, <strong>the questions are whether or not I'll take a significant loss on this album, and importantly, if I can mount the type of campaign that will generate attention, a broad listenership, and advance my career in music</strong>. </p>
<p>Join me in making the full vision for this album realized! Any and all levels of contributions are celebrated and welcomed. <strong>I'll be doing social media shout-outs throughout the campaign to <i>all</i> contributors, so you will be recognized personally and publicly</strong>!</p>
<p> </p>

First and foremost, the funds will help offset the costs of the recording— the producers/engineers, studio time, and musician fees. I have always been fortunate to get to play and record with incredibly talented and generous musicians and friends who care deeply about the project and material and play for very friendly rates. Nonetheless, it of course adds up. Additional money raised will go toward the manufacturing of the CDs (which, believe it or not, people still buy, and are a key part of getting the album out in pr and radio campaigns) and the vinyl. Anything beyond that will go toward the costs of a publicist and radio promoter. With few exceptions, most everyone whose music you've heard and loved who has a regional or national platform has had to invest heavily in PR and Radio efforts. Unfortunately, it usually costs money to build a viable career and achieve the status of having your music known and generating income. I am a modest guy, and mostly fulfilled with creating works that I think are valuable and strong, but I would still like to have a broader audience and the satisfaction of greater recognition amongst folk and Americana music lovers worldwide.  I'm certainly not on many listeners' radar. I think this album deserves the public's awareness and a place at the table with other social-oriented albums of this era (and folk/Americana releases in general). 

The Impact
As you can tell, your pre-orders, perk purchases and support of this project will bring an album that is timely and dear to my heart into the world properly. It's not my first go-round— this will be my 8th released album, and I have another album already recorded (but not yet mixed or mastered) and others written but unrecorded. My music has garnered praise and coverage from a range of outlets including Flagpole Magazine, American Songwriter, The Bluegrass Situation, Huffington Post, NPR, Paste, Peace Corps' Worldview Magazine, and plenty of Americana blogs worldwide. It's also gotten traction on radio in the U.S., Europe and Australia. 
I'm proud of the collaborators on my records, which includes friends and top notch musicians such as David Blackmon, Randall Bramblett, Crash Cason, Stuart Cole (Squirrel Nut Zippers), Jay Gonzalez (Drive-By Truckers), Robert Bret Hartley, Lera Lynn, Raphael McGregor, John Neff, Carlton Owens (Cracker), Matt Patton (Drive-By Truckers), and Bronson Tew.
On stage, I've been fortunate to play shows with a range of fantastic bands and songwriters. A short list includes James McMurtry, Josh Ritter, Shovels & Rope, Kevn Kinney, Abigail Washburn & the Sparrow Quartet featuring Bela Fleck, Jimbo Mathus, Shawn Mullins, Jim Lauderdale, Robert Ellis, Steep Canyon Rangers, Okkervil River, Larkin Poe, and Jonathan Byrd. 

Risks & Challenges
The main challenge in actualizing this album as detailed above is finding sufficient funding to cover all aspects of the release. Here's the thing: At the baseline level, this album will get completed and released. This means mixed, mastered, manufactured to CDs, and digitally distributed. It's a whole lot of money to do even these steps, and I'm hoping to offset the costs with your support of this campaign. That will benefit myself and my family so we don't take a big loss on the effort. Beyond that, getting the word out and having an opportunity for the album to make an impact and further my music career plus pressing vinyl for vinyl lovers to purchase and fully experience the album costs another pretty penny. So, the questions are whether or not I'll take a significant loss on this album, and importantly, if I can mount the type of campaign that will generate attention, a broad listenership, and advance my career in music. 
Join me in making the full vision for this album realized! Any and all levels of contributions are celebrated and welcomed. I'll be doing social media shout-outs throughout the campaign to all contributors, so you will be recognized personally and publicly!

<p><strong>Little Empire Productions</strong></p>
<p>I have worked in the entertainment industry my whole life. It is in my blood! My Mum has always taught me to pursue my passion and my Dad has always reminded me to work until I drop and then get up and work some more! These two philosophies have guided me wisely. If you have met me, you know, usually the first thing we talk about is what our passions are and how we are going about achieving them. Little Empire Productions brings us all together to create and share phenomenal, complex and beautiful stories through film, television and music.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>From My Heart To Yours</strong> </p>
<p>My family are entrepreneurs. We have all taken on challenges that have amazed those that have watched on. My Father was the first promoter to bring Russian entertainers to Australia: Baryshnikov, Nureyev, The Bolshoi Ballet: the list goes on. He hand picked acts and created the Moscow Circus and toured them around the world. He also introduced Cirque Du Soleil to Australia and many other phenomenal productions to the globe. My mother was one of the top marketing managers. I have grown up in circus tents, watched the Bolshoi ballerinas from the wings and did my homework in the dressing rooms of Rockstars! This is what I am made of. It's what I do best. When friends and family told me to stay in Australia and continue working on Australian productions I told them that I would love too but I also want to see what the rest of the world has to offer. To the shock of many I packed my bags and headed to America by myself to take on the world. I love working with the big networks! Channel Nine, Ten, SyFy Channel, FX, The Jim Henson Company and I also adore making my own creations! It is an honor to invite you to do this with me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Fun Stuff:</strong></p>
<p>We're estimating that the budget for Dragon will be around $30000. The more help we can get the more spectacular we can make it. I am training up on several different aerial apparatus so we have some beautiful, breathtaking moments. The cast will also be completely body painted. There will be some daring fire spinning as well. Please check out my website so you can see the productions that we have done in the past for similar budgets that we have made to look absolutely astonishing. </p>

<h3>My Campaign Goal </h3>
<p>I have been active as a violinist, composer and improviser in Seattle, the Bay Area and, most recently, in New York City.  My wife Molly and I are currently in the process of relocating to New England to be closer to family. </p>
<p>I will be recording a full length album of my compositions and improvisations for solo violin at a highly regarded recording studio in the Boston area.  This will be the first time I have had my solo music professionally recorded.  My goal is to have the album completed by this summer.  I will then make it available online and shop it around to record labels. I will also send it to the members of the press for reviews. Having this high quality document of my current music will be an essential next step in my career. My hope is that this will help to open up new professional opportunities as my wife and I start this new phase of our life. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1609343918/et2f08vhogt50em4xwnj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Funding Specifics </h3>
<ul>
<li>10 hours of recording studio time </li>
<li>3 hours of editing and mastering</li>
<li>250 CDs </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>The studio time includes set up and sound check. The time will be split up into two days. I want to capture all the details in the violin sound that I've never been able to get with my own home recordings.  Since the violin will be alone and exposed, rather than part of an ensemble, the sound quality is even more important. </p>
<p>I intend to record whole sections rather than get into super-detailed editing of individual notes so the editing process should not take too long. But the mastering is a crucial step which really makes a recording sound professional and, again, far superior to anything I could do myself. </p>
<p>The CDs will be mostly to send to labels and reviewers (yes, some people do still want actual physical CDs!)</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The end product of this project will be a high quality recording that can be enjoyed by anyone interested in music for violin.  There will be many interesting details in the music and subtleties in the sound so that new things can be discovered with repeated listening. </p>
<p>I have launched two successful Indiegogo campaigns previously: A performance of my musical, Bad Actor, in 2017;  and the debut album of my ensemble String Power in 2015.   Both of these projects were important ways to put my artistic pursuits out into the world.  The String Power album was the last professional recording I've made of my own music.  </p>
<p>I have grown a lot  during the 13 years I spent in New York. I feel that now is the right time to document the results of my development in what I hope will be an accurate depiction of my current musical self.  This is an important way to further my career as an improviser and composer and I hope will lead to new opportunities to make connections, create, teach and perform by myself and with others as the world opens up again. </p>

I have been active as a violinist, composer and improviser in Seattle, the Bay Area and, most recently, in New York City.  My wife Molly and I are currently in the process of relocating to New England to be closer to family. 
I will be recording a full length album of my compositions and improvisations for solo violin at a highly regarded recording studio in the Boston area.  This will be the first time I have had my solo music professionally recorded.  My goal is to have the album completed by this summer.  I will then make it available online and shop it around to record labels. I will also send it to the members of the press for reviews. Having this high quality document of my current music will be an essential next step in my career. My hope is that this will help to open up new professional opportunities as my wife and I start this new phase of our life. 

Funding Specifics 

10 hours of recording studio time 
3 hours of editing and mastering
250 CDs 


The studio time includes set up and sound check. The time will be split up into two days. I want to capture all the details in the violin sound that I've never been able to get with my own home recordings.  Since the violin will be alone and exposed, rather than part of an ensemble, the sound quality is even more important. 
I intend to record whole sections rather than get into super-detailed editing of individual notes so the editing process should not take too long. But the mastering is a crucial step which really makes a recording sound professional and, again, far superior to anything I could do myself. 
The CDs will be mostly to send to labels and reviewers (yes, some people do still want actual physical CDs!)
The Impact
The end product of this project will be a high quality recording that can be enjoyed by anyone interested in music for violin.  There will be many interesting details in the music and subtleties in the sound so that new things can be discovered with repeated listening. 
I have launched two successful Indiegogo campaigns previously: A performance of my musical, Bad Actor, in 2017;  and the debut album of my ensemble String Power in 2015.   Both of these projects were important ways to put my artistic pursuits out into the world.  The String Power album was the last professional recording I've made of my own music.

<h3>The Good Vibes Band Debut Album</h3>
<p>Thank you for checking out our campaign!</p>
<p>We, <strong>The Good Vibes Band</strong>, have been playing live shows in San Diego as a band for the last 8 years. These days, we play 3-4 shows a week all throughout San Diego County. We love playing live music - it's been our main source of inspiration for this project.</p>
<p>We finally decided to <strong>make the push as a band</strong> to get into the studio and <strong>put the needle to the wax</strong>. We researched the places to record and the people to record with, and decided to go with the best of the best. We will be recording the album at <strong>Big Fish Studios</strong> in Encinitas with Blake LaGrange, the owner of mastering.com and an expert producer, not to mention an old friend from high school. The date for recording is just around the corner, <strong>March 13 &amp; 14</strong>.</p>
<p>We decided to launch this fundraising campaign because this project is URGENT! Since setting a recording date in January, we have written <strong>5 brand new songs</strong>! In addition to our more seasoned material, we want to capture the excitement of our new originals - we want you to feel the newness of it all. In order to do that, we need the funding to make that happen in an efficient manner.</p>
<p>Recording the live band in the studio is only the first step in this process. After that, the music needs to be <strong>mixed, mastered, and distributed</strong>. Additionally, we will need professional <strong>album art and videos</strong> in order to help promote the music. As a local band, this all adds up to a budget that is unwieldy. However, with a little help from our fans and supporters, this will be no problem at all and we will be able to get a finished product to you in a very reasonable amount of time. We are looking forward to album tours<b> </b>in both <strong>California and Brazil, Summer </strong><b><strong>2</strong>020</b>!</p>

<p><strong>Join me in the Release of my New CD- ""I Can Face the Truth."" </strong></p>
<p>Background about this New Release:</p>
<p>I have been writing songs, recording and touring for a long time now. From my work with major labels like Elektra Records and Southcoast MCA, to Indie labels like Compass Records, King Easy, and Travianna, it has been an exciting musical journey that has won me a wealth of experience and friends. Thanks to those good friends and supporters I have launched and conducted many successful funding campaigns over the years. Now I'm about to release my newest recording project entitled ""I Can Face the Truth"" and I can't wait for you to hear it. </p>
<p>In the past year while unable to play ""LIVE"" Shows I was fortunate to continue working with my co-producer, engineer, and multi instrumentalist Dave Coleman. Masked and distanced together in his Howard's Apartment Studio we enlisted some of Nashville's best singers and musicians to breathe life into our creation. We even called on two wonderful singers in Belfast and County Meath to sing harmony. The result of all this ""Creative energy"" is a collection of 12 original songs plus one of my favorites by Hank Williams. This has been the most fun I've ever had in the studio and I consider this to be my best recording to date. </p>
<p><strong>Some of the folks who contributed musically to this project are: </strong></p>
<p>Dave Coleman - Guitar, Bass, Drums, Keyboard, Vocals, Engineer, Co-Producer</p>
<p>Chris Benelli - Drums</p>
<p>Paul Slivka - Bass Guitar</p>
<p>Tim Lorsch - Violin, Viola, and Cello</p>
<p>Brother Paul Brown - Hammond B3. </p>
<p><strong>Guest Vocalists Include:</strong></p>
<p>Tom Kimmel - Bluebird</p>
<p>David Starr - Always Old Friends</p>
<p>Jonell Mosser - Always Old Friends &amp; I'm Just Passing Through Here</p>
<p>Maura O'Connell - Summer in America &amp; Humankind </p>
<p>Gillian Tuite &amp; Joseph Murray - Flower and the Vine</p>
<p>Rebecca Folsom - Walls</p>
<p><strong>Song Co-writers:</strong> </p>
<p>Kim Richey - Flower and the Vine</p>
<p>Tom Kimmel - Bluebird</p>
<p>Rebecca Folsom - Walls</p>
<p>Elva Hahn - Ours for a Little While</p>
<p>Robert Weingartz - Always Old Friends</p>
<p>Dave Coleman - I Know a Girl</p>
<p>All 13 songs are recorded and mixed and ready for Mastering. There are many expenses yet to come and as an independent artist this is where I need your help. I have a modest estimate for what it will cost to garner the attention and airplay this CD deserves which totals at least $15,000. <strong>These expenses include: Studio Costs, Mastering, Manufacturing, Publicist, Radio Promotion, Mail Outs to Press and Radio, Video Production, Merchandise Line for Promotion.</strong> </p>
<p>I am calling on my ""Devoted Fans &amp; Friends"" to be a vital part of bringing this project to fruition. I see music as a healing power, a common language that can unite us, and a source of great joy during times of trouble, and I trust that you do too. </p>
<p>So I invite you to check out my Donation Tiers. You will find many choices of participation from a Pre-Release Download and Physical Copies of the CD, to ""One-of-a-Kind"" Vintage Western Shirts, and T-shirts, Songwriting Mentorships, and even In-Person House Concerts. Choose the level you are comfortable with and play an active role in releasing ""I Can Face the Truth.""</p>
<p>Even if you can't donate a dollar amount you can be a great help by spreading the word of my campaign to other music lovers. If you can welcome one friend to be a part of this effort through Twitter or Facebook or by smoke signal, please do. </p>
<p>** With ANY Contribution- you will be Entered into a Raffle to win an In-Person House Concert &amp; ""Vintage Rare Items"" spanning my career. Winner will be Announced on Release Date of the CD via Video. We anticipate official release the first quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>Together we can accomplish so much and I am excited to offer you such great perks for participating in this campaign. </p>
<p>Thanks from the heart!</p>

We are proud and honoured that our project will be supported by an Arts Council England Project Grant.</p><h3>The Project</h3><p>Written for voice, violoncello, clarinet and electronics, the short film follows a woman’s treatment for PTSD following sexual assault. During EMDR therapy she probes her subconscious and confronts traumatic memories. This surreal, dreamlike journey becomes a parallel quest to the Underworld, guided by its Queen, goddess Persephone, herself a survivor of sexual violence.</p><p>We wish to centre the narrative of recovery after sexual violence, which will intertwine with the myth of Persephone, symbolic of rebirth and renewal in ancient Greek culture, to underscore the message that trauma survivors have the power to heal themselves. In light of the increasing cases of sexual misconduct within the arts sector, we believe this project will have a valuable contribution to the important discussions around recovery.</p><h3>Your Support</h3><p>This funding will go towards the workshops and recording costs for the musicians and composer. If we are lucky enough to exceed our goal, we will put the funds to towards the filming phase of the project. </p><p>We are excited to be able to offer our supporters of £30 or more first access to booking for our online roundtable discussing PTSD with poet Mariah Whelan, composer/vocalist Laura Bowler, and an EMDR therapist.  £20 donations will get early access to the text and muscial score.

We are proud and honoured that our project will be supported by an Arts Council England Project Grant.The ProjectWritten for voice, violoncello, clarinet and electronics, the short film follows a woman’s treatment for PTSD following sexual assault. During EMDR therapy she probes her subconscious and confronts traumatic memories. This surreal, dreamlike journey becomes a parallel quest to the Underworld, guided by its Queen, goddess Persephone, herself a survivor of sexual violence.We wish to centre the narrative of recovery after sexual violence, which will intertwine with the myth of Persephone, symbolic of rebirth and renewal in ancient Greek culture, to underscore the message that trauma survivors have the power to heal themselves. In light of the increasing cases of sexual misconduct within the arts sector, we believe this project will have a valuable contribution to the important discussions around recovery.Your SupportThis funding will go towards the workshops and recording costs for the musicians and composer. If we are lucky enough to exceed our goal, we will put the funds to towards the filming phase of the project. We are excited to be able to offer our supporters of £30 or more first access to booking for our online roundtable discussing PTSD with poet Mariah Whelan, composer/vocalist Laura Bowler, and an EMDR therapist.  £20 donations will get early access to the text and muscial score.

<h3>A Garden Tomb Live Album with Joshua Aaron! </h3>
<p>We are so excited to announce the forthcoming Garden Tomb Live album! We will be recording a whole new album and music video, which will be available digitally (YouTube, iTunes etc) and on CD and DVD.</p>
<p>The recording/filming is scheduled for this upcoming September and there will be a live band featuring special guest, Aaron Shust and my friends right here in Israel!</p>
<p>I am so thrilled to be able to perform and record this album in a very special location in Jerusalem. The Garden Tomb! The place where we remember that HE HAS RISEN! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Do you want to be part of this project?</h3>
<p>As we've learned filming the Tower of David album, there is a lot of work and a big budget that goes into a Live Album. The Tower record was one of my favorite projects to date! So I am looking forward to this one, which has been on my heart for over two years now. What better time to film a LIVE album in Israel, than now. We're celebrating victory over an intense year here in Israel.  Covid is behind us and thanks-be-to-GOD the barrage of 4,300+ rockets has come to an end, We're coming back to life again in Yeshua's Name!</p>
<p><strong>I would be thrilled if you would help join me in this special project</strong></p>
<p>We are looking to raise $80,000 USD. This will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Live recording/team (12 songs or more)</li>
<li>Filming and staging for the Live Performance </li>
<li>Hiring of a band and crew</li>
<li>Cost of having some special guests, including their accommodations</li>
<li>Professional mixing and mastering of the Album</li>
<li>Full video production filming and editing</li>
<li>Printing and production of the CDs and DVDs</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are able, your help in this project would mean so much to me! </p>

<h3>Why the Garden Tomb?</h3>
<p>The Garden Tomb is a beautiful oasis in the heart of Jerusalem. Once you enter the location, all the sounds of the busy streets disappear and it is a beautiful place where people can gather to worship, share communion and most of all reflect on how our Savior conquered death! And even though it is unknown if this is the actual tomb that Yeshua rose from, it is such a great place to take a moment to remember His sacrifice and the gift of salvation that He has given us! Thus I cannot wait to worship with you from this location, whether you are able to come physically or whether you can watch it from your screen or listen to this moment of worship together! </p>

Our first shows outside of Canada were to be in the UK this May. The UK tour was to be followed by both an American tour and an extensive Canadian tour. We, like all musicians, have had to cancel or postpone all of our concerts for the time being and we’ve decided to shift all of our focus for the foreseeable future to recording our first full length album.

<p>Hi Friends!</p>
<p>I wrote an album called ‘I’m Listening’...and I need your help to bring it to life.</p>
<p>Doing a full length album has been a dream in my heart since I was a little girl and nudges from God and all of you guys has given me the guts to go after that dream.  Who knew albums cost so much money though, $15,000 to be exact. </p>
<p>Through this season of no work for the past few months for my family and no shows or opportunities in site I need your support now more then ever to make this happen.  So many of you have asked us how you can help us through this time and this is honestly such a great way. By pre-purchasing this album it will help support the upfront production costs and allow me to move forward in actually recording it.  </p>
<p>Music has always been my way to communicate to God and pour my heart out to Him but it's also a tool that we have to hear from Him.  To actively declare who He is and join a heavenly sound that is so much bigger than just my world and infinitely more powerful than anything we could emotionally conjure up.  'I'M LISTENING' is going to be an album that is full of songs that reflect this concept and have allowed me to learn to posture my heart towards God and learn to sit at His feet first before I ever move.</p>
<p>One of the very personal reasons I am making this album is also for the legacy of my own family.  I want my kids, for the rest of their lives, to be able to hold a finished project of songs from their mothers heart that document my faith, my convictions and empower them to go after their own dreams for the sake of God's kingdom. </p>
<p>Will you help me?</p>
<p>To make this album a reality I need your help! I've launched this IndieGoGo campaign for 30 days to see these songs become a reality with the initial goal of $15,000, a goal that can be met if even 1,000 people gave $15!</p>
<p>We've got lots of great perks for you - everything from an 'I'm Listening' T-Shirt, an autographed vinyl release, to an acoustic worship night in your home - so be sure to scroll around and check out the various options.</p>
<p>I will also be giving 10% of everything I raise to Burning Stone Ministries.  BSM is a beautiful ministry run by my good friend Karen Ward that focuses on igniting hope and healing in our Canadian Indigenous Communities, specifically the remote Northern locations. It is a ministry I have actively worked with first hand and am so excited to be partnering with. You can read more about them here: <a href=""https://burningstoneministries.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://burningstoneministries.com</a>  Help me bless their socks off!</p>

One of the very personal reasons I am making this album is also for the legacy of my own family.  I want my kids, for the rest of their lives, to be able to hold a finished project of songs from their mothers heart that document my faith, my convictions and empower them to go after their own dreams for the sake of God's kingdom. 
Will you help me?
To make this album a reality I need your help! I've launched this IndieGoGo campaign for 30 days to see these songs become a reality with the initial goal of $15,000, a goal that can be met if even 1,000 people gave $15!
We've got lots of great perks for you - everything from an 'I'm Listening' T-Shirt, an autographed vinyl release, to an acoustic worship night in your home - so be sure to scroll around and check out the various options.
I will also be giving 10% of everything I raise to Burning Stone Ministries.  BSM is a beautiful ministry run by my good friend Karen Ward that focuses on igniting hope and healing in our Canadian Indigenous Communities, specifically the remote Northern locations. It is a ministry I have actively worked with first hand and am so excited to be partnering with. You can read more about them here: https://burningstoneministries.com  Help me bless their socks off!

I have access to a fabulous mentor who helps me in all things ‘recording’ and is there for any kind of musical emergency I might face.  (Yes, musical emergencies are a thing!)  I also have a network of incredible instrumentalists who can add lots of musical deliciousness to my creations.I will keep you updated with my progress as we go and let you know of any delays should they happen.Other Ways You Can HelpFor those of you who are able contribute to my campaign, you have my utmost gratitude.  If it is simply not possible for you to contribute but you still want to help, please share my campaign link using the tools in the upper right of the campaign.  You can also support me by subscribing to my mailing list, streaming or purchasing my music and following/supporting me on social media.   You can access all this using the link below.  https://ffm.bio/beccagohnThank you from the bottom of my heart for taking the time to read and consider my project proposal.  I am super excited to see how this little pot of artistic seeds blooms!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Dear Friends and Supporters,</h3>
<p>Since 2015, we have been working on our full-length album, Malvasia, which includes original and traditional material, some of which you will have heard in our concerts, and more that is new and exciting. The full band was brought together in the studio for this project, including some of our members who are now scattered across Europe (including Stelios on the accordion and Carla on the vocals).</p>
<p><strong>It is now time for us to release our music.</strong></p>
<p>The material is recorded and we are now in the final stages of the production process (mixing, mastering), before moving onto manufacture followed by a PR campaign. Once the album is out (CD and Vinyl formats!), we plan to launch it with a huge party, true to our Mediterranean roots, and hope that as many of you as possible will be able to join us (post-pandemic restrictions, of course).</p>
<p>We are reaching out to you to help us finalise this now overdue project. We plan to have the album ready within the next 6 months. </p>
<p><strong>How will we be using this funding?</strong><br/>-Master the album tracks <br/>-Design and print the albums (digital, CD and Vinyl formats)<br/>-Launch a PR campaign to spread the word and reach new fans  (specific PR companies do this)</p>
<p>We are planning to raise £3000 to cover the remaining cost of our project. </p>
<p><strong>*UPDATE* </strong><br/>We have reached our target £3000 in record time thanks to all of you and our tracks have now been mixed and mastered.</p>
<p><strong>We are now aiming for our 'stretch goal' of £6000.</strong> This will allow us to fully fund a successful international PR campaign (£1000) and to organise an epic album launch at a London venue, where we will invite pizzica bands from Italy and France to join us (post-Covid restrictions of course!). We hope that this will take place in Autumn 2021.</p>
<p>Have a look at the range of rewards in exchange for your generous contributions and musical support.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How this will help us</h3>
<p>We are an independent band and have, so far, self-funded all our recording projects. Usually we raise funds through concerts, saving a little bit from each gig payment. But as we all know, 2020 has been unexpectedly harsh for all artists. Your contribution will help us to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finalise an album that we have been slowly self-funding for the past 4 years;</li>
<li>Enable us to fund a campaign that will help us reach a wider audience and that will promote our music beyond our usual fans;</li>
<li>Give us a real energy and confidence boost in getting this album done and sent out to all of our supporters (you!)</li>
</ul>

<h3>We are Holy Death Trio...</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1600919324/nv28qripo1llvve4shk9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>A heavy rock power trio from Austin, TX.  Our music can be described as Heavy F'in Rock-N-Roll and some would put us in the category of Stoner Rock.  Our goal is to transcend what has already been done in these genres and pump up the production value to put our album next to a classic album and not tell the difference in age or quality.</p>
<p>We’re ready to release our 1st full length album: BLACK WAVE. Composed over the last year, this 10 song album is heavy, catchy, groovy, technical, tasteful and more immersive than any of our music in the past. In short, it's going to make you move.  We have already recorded half of the album with Charles Godfrey of Scary American Studios, who has worked at the legendary Sonic Ranch Studio's recording some of the best hits in the last 10 years and we are ready to get back into that studio and record the second half.</p>
<p>We are proud of this music and can’t wait to send it out into the universe, but we need more funds to finish the job. Making an album is expensive and since we are not affiliated with a record label, the funds can only come from ourselves and our supporters. This campaign is to bring our community together to try and make this album a reality. If you like what we do, please consider pledging for a copy of the record or one of the other perks we’re offering. Every little bit helps.</p>
<p>We are truly grateful for all the love you’ve shown us and can’t thank you enough for the support! </p>
<p>Your friends,</p>
<p><strong>Holy Death Trio</strong></p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of the costs of releasing this record:</p>
<p>Recording: $6000</p>
<p>Mastering: $1500</p>
<p>Vinyl Pressing: $1500</p>
<p>Record Jackets: $600</p>
<p>Album Art: $500</p>
<p>PR: $900</p>
<p>Total: $11,000</p>
<p>Since we’ve already invested close to $3000 of our own money into the first half of the recording, we lowered our goal for this campaign to $7500. If we surpass our goal, we’ll put that money towards music videos and other advertisements to push album sales.</p>
<p>What You Get...</p>
<p>The number one thing we hope you get from this campaign?… a copy of the record! However, if you’re interested in something different we’ve got you covered at all these different levels. </p>
<p>Please note: all perks $10 and above get a digital download of the album.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By funding this campaign, you will undoubtedly have a big impact on our career:</p>
<p>You make releasing a record possible! As an independent band, we get $0 from record labels to help us offset the costs of releasing an album. If we didn’t crowd fund our record releases, they just wouldn’t happen. By getting your copy of the album here, you’re allowing this music to be published! </p>
<p>You make touring possible! We can’t stress enough how important selling vinyl is to our bottom line when on tour. Selling vinyl turns music sales directly into gas and food money on the road, without which we could not make touring work. By funding this album you’re helping us spread the word about our music!</p>
<p>You make earning a living as a musician possible! In order to save up enough money to pay for vinyl record manufacturing ourselves, we’d have to take a big pay cut at our shows for probably several years. Having the album funded by our fans allows us to collect our full cut from the gigs we play, which in turn helps us pay the bills as professional musicians.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> The biggest risk to the project would be delays during the manufacturing process. We’re not exactly sure how this will effect our project, but we will be sure to keep you updated on the expected release date. Currently, we think a safe estimate for the vinyl release date is March 2021.</p>
<p> The second risk is that we don't hit our funding goal and have to press an EP on vinyl instead of the full album. Either way you will receive an album.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that sometimes donating your hard earned cash is not an option. If you can’t donate but you still want to help out, please give the campaign a share on social media. The more that people visit this page, the better chance we have at reaching our goal. <br/><br/>You can also follow us on Instagram, Facebook and what helps the most is following us on your streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, etc. When you do this, it helps get us on better playlist and to show up in the ""Release Radar"".</p>

PR: $900
Total: $11,000
Since we’ve already invested close to $3000 of our own money into the first half of the recording, we lowered our goal for this campaign to $7500. If we surpass our goal, we’ll put that money towards music videos and other advertisements to push album sales.
What You Get...
The number one thing we hope you get from this campaign?… a copy of the record! However, if you’re interested in something different we’ve got you covered at all these different levels. 
Please note: all perks $10 and above get a digital download of the album.

The Impact
By funding this campaign, you will undoubtedly have a big impact on our career:
You make releasing a record possible! As an independent band, we get $0 from record labels to help us offset the costs of releasing an album. If we didn’t crowd fund our record releases, they just wouldn’t happen. By getting your copy of the album here, you’re allowing this music to be published! 
You make touring possible! We can’t stress enough how important selling vinyl is to our bottom line when on tour. Selling vinyl turns music sales directly into gas and food money on the road, without which we could not make touring work. By funding this album you’re helping us spread the word about our music!
You make earning a living as a musician possible! In order to save up enough money to pay for vinyl record manufacturing ourselves, we’d have to take a big pay cut at our shows for probably several years. Having the album funded by our fans allows us to collect our full cut from the gigs we play, which in turn helps us pay the bills as professional musicians.

Risks & Challenges
 The biggest risk to the project would be delays during the manufacturing process. We’re not exactly sure how this will effect our project, but we will be sure to keep you updated on the expected release date. Currently, we think a safe estimate for the vinyl release date is March 2021.
 The second risk is that we don't hit our funding goal and have to press an EP on vinyl instead of the full album. Either way you will receive an album.

Other Ways You Can Help
We understand that sometimes donating your hard earned cash is not an option. If you can’t donate but you still want to help out, please give the campaign a share on social media. The more that people visit this page, the better chance we have at reaching our goal. You can also follow us on Instagram, Facebook and what helps the most is following us on your streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, etc. When you do this, it helps get us on better playlist and to show up in the ""Release Radar"".

A safe space to express and be, without boundaries.In 2019 HEX launched its own label HEX Recordings, characterised by a wide range of Techno shades that all share a common Post-Apocalyptic & Dark mood.Today, HEX has become a global movement, part of many people’s lives and that represents for us all an escape from social prejudices and imposed limitations. An experience established for its coherency as a free art expression.

<h2>Help me release my new musical project!</h2>
<p><i>""Vivienne Aerts vocalist, performer &amp; composer specializing in experience design is coming up with a new album that will consist of her original music and features over a hundred female musicians. Expect a mix of jazz, electro-pop, and improvised music. On top of that, with every CD you buy, you will receive a bar of Original Beans Femmes de Virunga, the chocolate that is truly an “all women chocolate”, and for every bar sold, a tree gets planted. So when you buy this album, you are not only getting all-women-music and a bar of chocolate, but you are also actively replanting trees and giving women in Congo a better future!""</i></p>
<p>BACKGROUND : </p>
<p>Having met and worked with tons of talented female musicians as a Dutch vocalist and composer while living in Boston and New York these last few years, I wanted to make a musical project that features them all. Since it’s not possible to get together because of the pandemic, we are forced to get creative and meet in a different way. Currently, everybody is able to record in their home studio, so this inspired me to create a musical project together with more than 100 female 'up &amp; coming new generation musicians' from over 40 countries. During a time when it looks like there is no bright future, I realize that people need hope. This has inspired me to start my own project for women, by women which will result in musical exchange and creative soundscapes building a better world. </p>
<p>ORIGINAL BEANS CHOCOLATE </p>
<p>Together with my husband (pastry chef Ted Steinebach, who worked at Eleven Madison Park*** - one of the best restaurants in the world) we have been organizing multi-sensory performances under the name Vervool (<a href=""http://www.vervool.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.vervool.com</a>) using jazz, haute cuisine, and modern art. When I first got in touch with the Dutch Chocolate brand Original Beans, the story behind it really resonated. Especially the <a href=""https://originalbeans.com/femmes-de-virunga-congo/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Femmes de Virunga project</a> has always held a special place in my heart. Living in an area in Congo that is torn apart by civil wars, these women are often left on their own. Because their men are taken by militia and other rebellious groups, they have to take care of themselves and their families. This Original Beans project has now 1500 women that run this sustainable cacao farm and tree nursery where chocolate is grown and sold in a regenerative way. With Original Beans giving them a fair, stable price for their cocoa (up to 90% on top of the world cocoa price), they are empowered to send their kids to school and take care of themselves and their community.</p>
<p>YOUR SUPPORT</p>
<p>Your donations are not only helping me release this EP.  Part of this goes back to Original Beans so they can <i>actively replant trees and give women in Congo a better future</i>.</p>
<p>Secondly, with your donation, you are supporting the hiring of around 100 independent female musicians and covering for Producer/Engineer costs, Mixing and Mastering, Artwork and design, Marketing, and PR. So much is involved in producing a project like this and the people who collaborate with me will put just as much time, energy, and love into this as I will.  </p>
<div>
<p>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET </p>
<p>I am happy to announce that I have been awarded a grant from the SENA Music Production Fund and the Netherland-America Foundation to get this thing started, but the cost of the entire project (including marketing) is close to $20,000. I'm hoping to sell 1000 albums, so this means 1000 bars of chocolate, and that will mean that there will be 1000 trees planted. --&gt; <a href=""https://originalbeans.com/one-bar-one-tree/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://originalbeans.com/one-bar-one-tree/</a> </p>
<p>I've added different perks for different levels of contribution, and YES there is a LOT of chocolate involved!</p>
<p>By supporting, you will also get an insight into the creation of this project as I will update you on all the different steps on the road. There will be a podcast featuring the many extraordinary women as well as private listening parties on zoom. </p>
</div>
<p>ONE MINUTE VIDEO - an impression </p>
<p>For starters, I've asked some of my female music friends to send me a video of themselves playing or singing one note, any note, any length. Then I used all these little clips of 40 women to create this <a href=""https://youtu.be/K6Lqm6LY_qE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">one-minute soundscape video</a> that was presented in celebration of International Women's Day. </p>

Omdat hun mannen worden meegenomen door militia en andere rebellerende groepen, moeten ze voor zichzelf en hun gezinnen zorgen. Dit Original Beans-project heeft inmiddels 1500 vrouwen die deze duurzame cacaoboerderij en boomkwekerij runnen waar op een regeneratieve manier chocolade wordt verbouwd en verkocht. Omdat Original Beans hen een eerlijke, stabiele prijs voor hun cacao geeft (tot 90% bovenop de wereldcacaoprijs), zijn ze in staat hun kinderen naar school te sturen en voor zichzelf en hun gemeenschap te zorgen.JOUW STEUNDe donaties helpen me niet alleen om deze EP uit te brengen. Een deel hiervan gaat terug naar Original Beans, zodat ze actief bomen kunnen herplanten en vrouwen in Congo een betere toekomst kunnen geven.Ten tweede ondersteun je met je donatie het inhuren van ongeveer 100 onafhankelijke vrouwelijke muzikanten en dekt u de kosten van Producer / Engineer, Mixing en Mastering, Artwork en design, Marketing en PR. Er komt zoveel kijken bij het produceren van een project als dit en de mensen die met mij samenwerken zullen er net zoveel tijd, energie en liefde in steken als ik.WAT ER NODIG IS EN WAT JE KRIJGTSuper dankbaar dat ik subsidie ​​heb gekregen van het SENA Music Production Fonds en de Netherland-America Foundation voor het starten van dit project. Maar de kosten van het hele project (inclusief marketing) bedragen bijna $ 20.000. Daarom helpen alle kleine en groote bijdragen mee en heb ik verschillende 'perks' or rewards toegevoegd de voor verschillende niveaus van je bijdrage, en JA, er is VEEL chocolade!Door te ondersteunen, krijg je ook inzicht in de totstandkoming en het verloop van dit project, aangezien ik je op de hoogte zal houden van alle verschillende stappen op de weg. En, er zal een podcast zijn met de vele buitengewone vrouwen en privé-luisterpartijen op zoom.ONE MINUTE VIDEO - een impressieOm te beginnen heb ik een aantal van mijn vrouwelijke collegas gevraagd me een video te sturen waarin ze één noot, hoog of laag, lang of kort, spelen of zingen. Vervolgens heb ik al deze kleine clips van 40 vrouwen gebruikt om deze soundscape-video van één minuut te maken die werd gepresenteerd ter ere van Internationale Vrouwendag. --> https://youtu.be/K6Lqm6LY_qE HEEL ERG BEDANKTDank aan iedereen die mij heeft gesteund en die mij blijft steunen bij mijn inspanningen. Ik heb twee volledige albums uitgebracht en ik had ze zonder jou niet kunnen uitbrengen.OVERVivienne Aerts is een Nederlandse zangeres, dirigent en componist uit New York met een focus op elektronica en multi-sensorisch experience design.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>I'm recording a new album! More than just a collection of songs, the ""Whatever Is"" album is a response to our current cultural environment. In the midst of fear, chaos, and broken connections between people, <strong>I want to provide songs that will help us shift our focus toward something more positive.</strong></p>
<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>In 2019 I released my first EP ""Abiding"" and was overwhelmed by the support and encouragement I received. After many years of writing songs and only sharing them with my local church, recording them was a dream project that sparked even bigger dreams. </p>
<p>This year I started meeting regularly with co-writers and working on new songs. What has emerged are heartfelt songs of faithfulness and intention. They are about fixing our eyes on Jesus, being purposeful with our thoughts, and returning to him when those thoughts stray. I wrote many of these songs of hope and trust long before the pandemic and protests, but they are so timely as we navigate the state of our world, and I’m excited to share them with you now. </p>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>I was hoping to do a live worship night to record the album, but then the ""rona"" happened, and plans changed. Thankfully, I was introduced to my new friend Shane Nelson at Asaph Records.</p>
<p>I met Shane through one of my co-writers in Greenville. We worked on a project together, and I knew he was the perfect fit for this album. <strong>We have come up with a plan to do a “live in the studio” recording on August 29, 2020.</strong> Our band will record the album live at Asaph Records in Greenville, SC, with a small group of friends and supporters. We need two days of rehearsal to prepare for one evening of recording the album. Then Shane will mix and master the tracks for the final release. We will also have a video crew onsite to record the live session to do a video release along with the EP.</p>

<h3>Costs &amp; Rewards</h3>
<p>Music is expensive to create, but I believe it is worth it to provide a soundtrack for our lives.

Musiken har sin grund i  Max Martin- poppen jag skapar och därifrån blommar den ut i gateade trummor, mjuka pads och rytmiska ljudlandskap.Jag använder mina gamla trofasta  syntar, från min schweiziska armékniv Minilouge synth till leksaksynthensom jag brukade leka med som barn och självklart, flöjt, massor av flöjt!Här är ett litet smakprov på låten ""Love letter""A FAREWELL TO GIRLHOOD BUDGETDet här är ett passionprojekt som jag har velat göra så länge.Jag gör detta på egen hand under min egen label.budgeten för detta projekt är 10 000 kronorOch det är för att täcka bl.a. :Kostnader för mastring och distributionArtworkCD tryckPR och marknadsföringskostnaderTransportkostanderCrowdfundingavgiften och skatterInspelning PAYPAL OCH SWISHOm du vill bidra men är osäker på hur du använder plattformen så går det jättebra att använda Paypal eller Swish istället.

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>I'm finally recording an EP! More than just a collection of songs, the ""Unashamed Project"" is a call to many who have experienced hurt, guilt, and shame. I am unashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and who He has called me to be! It's okay to be different, sound different, and be unique! Amid the pandemic, a lot of anxiety and depression has set in and many have lost their hope! These songs will help us sustain and develop an unashamed mindset to rely on Jesus!</p>
<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>In 2017, I decided to move by faith and began working on original music. After many years of privately writing songs, recording voice notes, and leaving them as ideas. I finally had the faith to launch out and release all that God has placed inside of me! In 2018, I released my debut single ""Take It All"" and to this day I am amazed by the support and encouragement I received.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In 2018, I started connecting with producers and started working on new songs. BUT, I hit a major roadblock. I started to doubt EVERYTHING I was doing which put a huge dent in the momentum I had! Through prayer, mentorship, and having the right people around me, I regained the confidence to continue! I began to realize how little I had relied on God! Almost as if I was ashamed to need help! But, through this time of isolation, I've seen how powerful it is to trust God FULLY and have a community that understands and believes in you, too! </p>
<h2>Make A Pledge Today</h2>
<p>All donations come with a gift. So not only are you investing in this project but the lives of those who may need to hear this message! </p>
<h2>The $$$</h2>
<p>Creating great music is VERY expensive. A single song created with producers, musicians, mixing, and mastering can cost between <u><strong>$1500-$3000</strong></u>. </p>
<p>So I have two goals. <strong>Goal #1 is $10,000</strong>. This will cover the cost of having a 7 song live EP (Mix, Mastering, Recording Engineer, Musicians, BGVocalists, and Tech Rentals). </p>
<p><strong>Goal #2 is $16,000</strong>. This will cover the cost to have a video recording/live concert EP (Venue, Videographer, Editing, Lighting, Lighting Tech and two $500 Grants to deserving Students (Secondary or Post Secondary).</p>
<p>I’ve put together some <u><i><strong>EXCLUSIVE</strong></i></u> perks (some of them will only be available during the campaign). Click the perk boxes for details on what's included.</p>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>As an artist, people always ask about new music and ask the question ""when is your album coming out?"" and I always respond ""I'm working on it"". That meant when I can afford to do it! The majority of folks are unaware of the costs behind making an album. I chose to be super transparent for all to see what it takes! I am determined to push through and make it work! The biggest challenge is going to be getting to the stretch goal of $16,000. The biggest help will be the money I raise through this campaign!</p>

<br/><strong>Bio for Sultans of String:</strong>
</h2><p>3x JUNO nominees and SiriusXM winners Sultans of String create “Energetic and exciting music from a band with talent to burn!” (Maverick Magazine UK). Thrilling their audiences with their genre-hopping passport of Celtic reels, flamenco, Gypsy-jazz, Arabic, Cuban, and South Asian rhythms, Sultans of String celebrate musical fusion and human creativity with warmth and virtuosity. Fiery violin dances with rumba-flamenco guitar, while bass and percussion lay down unstoppable grooves. Acoustic strings meet with electronic wizardry to create layers and depth of sound, while world rhythms excite audiences to their feet with the irresistible need to dance.</p><p>Since releasing their debut album Luna in 2007, Sultans of String have continually strived to make each chart-topping album more original and meaningful than the last. That includes working with an orchestra (2013's Symphony), teaming with Pakistani sitarist Anwar Khurshid (2015's Subcontinental Drift) and even crafting a world-music holiday album (2017's Christmas Caravan), which landed them on the Billboard charts and the New York Times. Their ambition and work ethic have garnered them multiple awards and accolades, including three JUNO nominations, first place in the International Songwriting Competition (out of 15,000 entries), three Canadian Folk Music Awards and countless other honours, plus a Queen’s Diamond Jubilee medal (for bandleader Chris McKhool). Their 2020 release Refuge is already garnering awards including 2 Independent Music Awards for Instrumental Song of the Year and World Music Producer of the Year, as well as 2021 CFMA for Producer of the Year for Chris McKhool and John Bailey.</p><p>McKhool has an Egyptian-born mother who happened to play piano, teach classical theory, and feed her young son as much Middle Eastern cuisine as she did music lessons. From there, the powerful violinist developed a taste for multi-genre string sounds and found a like-minded crew of all-world enthusiasts. When McKhool first heard founding guitarist Kevin Laliberté’s (Jesse Cook) rumba rhythm, their musical synergy created Sultans of String’s signature sound – the intimate and playful relationship between violin and guitar. From this rich foundation, the dynamic duo grew, featuring such amazing musical friends as in-the-pocket bass master Drew Birston (Chantal Kreviazuk), and the jaw-dropping beats of percussionist Chendy Leon.</p><p>Their live resume is similarly stellar.

</div></div>","I'm recording an EP!
Dear friends and family, 
I am very excited to announce that this summer I will be recording and releasing an EP! I wrote these songs over the course of ten years. In my opinion, they're the best I've ever written. I can't wait to share them with all of you!

A Little About Me...
I've been writing songs and performing since I was about five years old.

In high school, I got the chance to record my first album, Offering, which I released in 2005. Some of you will remember this artifact ;)

And just for fun, here's my very-professional CD-release announcement:
Since then, it's been SIXTEEN YEARS since I've formally recorded or released any music. I never stopped writing music or wanting to share it, but I couldn't quite figure out how it fit into my life after high school. If I wasn't going to pursue a career in songwriting, did it really make sense to spend so much time and energy on music? But perhaps the biggest reason I put songwriting on the back burner was that I got scared. The more time that passed and the older I got, the more risky it seemed to invest (financially, emotionally, time-wise, etc.) into music or call myself a songwriter. I couldn't tell if I was any good anymore, and I didn't want to embarrass myself by releasing music that wasn't ""perfect.""What a sad and silly way to spend sixteen years!!!I'm so thankful to be leaving that period behind. I'll spare you the details, but over the past two years, I've gone through quite a transformative journey. I've learned to honor my love of music and writing enough to pursue both wholeheartedly again. I've learned that it is absolutely necessary to take risks in order to live a life that feels worthwhile.
Still, I felt hesitant and nervous to start this project, and I might never have done it if my incredible new friend Stephen Brackett hadn't given me a big kick in the pants by offering to pay for my recording time with our other friend Dave Young of Widget Studios. Another thing I've learned over the past two years is that it's impossible to take the really important risks in life apart from the love and support of others. 

^Not a photo of Stephen, Dave, or Joel. Just a photo illustrating love and support with two of my favorite musical friends, Misha and Shantelle <3 
So here's is my big risk of 2021--I'm asking YOU to donate to my campaign and help bring this EP into the world!My goal is to raise $7,300 over the next 15 days to cover the cost of production, mixing, mastering, hiring session musicians, and releasing this collection of songs.

<h3>Of Hard Times &amp; Harmony [Extended for pre-orders]</h3>
<p>Windborne has spent the past 3 years bringing our unique blend of ""stunningly powerful vocal harmony,"" coupled with a message of social justice to communities around the country. Throughout our travels, we kept hearing from people who share how this music has had a profound impact on their lives, revitalizing them in a time when they felt mired in hopelessness and helping them connect with their communities through music and action. Touched by your stories, we have developed our concert repertoire to not only entertain, but to uplift, energize, and inspire.</p>
<p>As our continued offering to meet that need in a time of division, we are SO excited to announce our latest project, <u><strong>Of Hard Times &amp; Harmony.</strong></u></p>
<p><u><strong>Of Hard Times &amp; Harmony</strong></u> is an album of critique, activism, inspiration, and introspection. With <strong>14 tracks in four languages</strong>, it will come in a <strong>CD-sized hardcover book</strong> with lyrics, art, and essays to accompany each piece. These arrangements represent the product of years of singing together almost every day, intimately learning each others voices and discovering how to use the power of vocal harmony to form something beyond the component parts. <strong>BBC Travelling Folk </strong>calls us<strong> </strong><i>""A quartet the likes of which I haven't seen since... Coope, Boyes and Simpson, the Watersons, or The Voice Squad. Just absolutely phenomenal!"" </i></p>
<p>We have some great rewards for you, from signed &amp; numbered limited-editions, free VIP release party tickets ($20 value) to Zoom lessons and concerts, t-shirts, ""song sponsorships,"" sheet music of the arrangements, and more!</p>
<p><i><strong>Ready to support the project now?</strong> </i>Click on any box to the right to see everything that's included in the Perk level, then click the ""Get This Perk"" button to proceed to payment! If you want to make a donation of any amount with no perk, go to the top of the page and click the pink ""Back It"" button.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Grassroots, People-Powered Music</h3>
<p>There are just 4 people who work for Windborne, and you hear them on every track! We don't have a big label producing our albums, and are able to stay independent for one reason: YOU!</p>
<p>The generous support of our community has made it possible for us to pursue this calling full time, and we are asking for your help in bringing <u><strong>Of Hard Times &amp; Harmony</strong></u> to life! Here are some of the costs involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>$5,000 <strong>Recording, editing, mixing, &amp; mastering</strong>- We are so proud of these songs, and want the recordings to convey all the richness, vitality, and intricacy they have in performance</li>
<li>$15,000 <strong>CD/Book Manufacturing </strong>- In order to fulfill our vision of a multi-faceted presentation of a beautiful hardcover book with gorgeous art, song lyrics, and essays telling the story and history of each piece, we need to do a run of 5,000 copies to make the unit cost affordable.</li>
<li>$6500 <strong>The nitty gritty</strong>- It's not glamorous, but things like rights &amp; royalties, graphic design as well as packaging and shipping all the rewards,</li>
<li>
<strong>Fees</strong> 8-10% of what we raise will go to the Indiegogo platform fee and credit card processing fees will cost at least $5,000 likely a little bit more, </li>
<li>$5,000 <strong>Promotion</strong>: it is becoming increasingly clear to us that a strong radio and digital promotion campaign is vital to getting these songs out into the world and reaching new audiences. And it works: We topped the Folk Charts on our last radio promotion campaign!</li>

<h3>Keep the music alive!</h3>
<p>We are in the midst of a crisis for the performing arts. Venues are shutting down, and many artists are forced to pause their artistic work in order to make ends meet. Your support is more impactful than ever - you aren't simply supporting this album, but your pledge is what enables us to continue pursuing our artistic goals.</p>
<p>You can keep us creating, connecting, and commentating on the times we are in. If music is helping you get through this time, please help us get through it too! Join in making sure that when we are able to come together again, Windborne will be out there making music, teaching song, and singing out.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The tracks are recorded, and we have started the editing process. These are uncertain times, and both manufacturing and shipping industries have been experiencing delays, but the audio should be finished this year (and backers will be given access to early digital downloads at that time) with a physical ship date in the first half of 2021.</p>
<h3>Lots of Exciting Perks!</h3>
<p>Aside from <strong><i>Of Hard Times &amp; Harmony</i></strong> itself, we wanted to highlight some of the other great perks you could get!</p>
<p><strong>Sing These Songs: </strong>In a singing group or choir? This is your chance to get full sheet music arrangements (at a discounted rate) along with the book. Some pieces will not be available due to publishing rights restrictions, sorry!</p>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Take a private lesson with a group member, or consult about vocal arranging! You'll get one-on-one time and musical inspiration!</p>
<p><strong>Producer:</strong> If you believe in Windborne's mission, music, and message, and want to support us being able to continue doing it, consider becoming a Windborne Producer! You get your name in the book, a bunch of other perks, and you'll know you are vital in supporting this work!</p>
<p><strong>Sponsor a Song:</strong> Sponsor a song in the book and even write a sentence about why you are doing so! Consider dedicating a song to a loved one, organization, or cause that is important to you.</p>
<p><strong>Private Zoom Concert/Workshop</strong>: A great idea for a birthday, or other celebration! Windborne sings and chats with you and your select friends. Bring music into your community!</p>
<p><strong>Benefactor and Lifetime of Song!</strong> If you do have the extra means and want to make a huge difference in our lives, consider these levels (or in between!) We know that this kind of gift is rare, and we are so touched. Whether it is custom arrangements of a song, or lifetime Windborne tickets, we will find the perfect way to thank you. Your support enables us to keep creating and singing to the world!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Archie is 14 and has been passionate about singing all his life.  Hailing from Great Milton in Oxfordshire, he was a chorister at Magdalen College Oxford, under the baton of Mark Williams, reluctantly 'retiring' at the age of 12.  For the last eighteen months he has been studying with Maria Thompson, who prepared him successfully for his singing Diploma and for his entry into the BBC Young Chorister of the Year competition.  </p>
<p>Still a treble, he has continued to sing both as a soloist and collaboratively.  He has a particular love of the Baroque to early Classical periods and wishes to record, professionally, some of the music that means so much to him, before his voice changes, accompanied by authentic period instruments.  The music will represent a journey, or progress, through geography and time, across Baroque Europe.</p>

<p>The formation of the Trust was made possible through the remarkable work of Friends of Cathedral Music (FCM) which, since its launch in 1956, has given generous grants to Anglican and Roman Catholic cathedrals, church and collegiate chapel choirs in the UK and overseas, including more than £2 million in the past six years alone. It has also endowed places for choristers and strived to maintain the glorious cathedral tradition of choral worship.</p>

<p>FOOD REDISTRIBUTION CHARITY IN LONDON FIGHTING FOOD WASTE AND HUNGER</p>
<p>1.5 million adults in London struggle to afford to eat every day, 400,000 children are at risk of missing the next meal. Meanwhile, our food industry generates almost 2 million tonnes of good, edible surplus food each year.</p>
<p>The Felix Project is a London-based food redistribution waste charity set up in 2016 to tackle both issues.</p>

</div><div>
<p>The Save Me Trust  exists to protect the welfare and dignity of wild animals</p>
<p>Save Me was founded by Dr. Brian May and Anne Brummer to work on the issues affecting wildlife today.</p>
<p>Climate change, increasing human population, destruction of habitats and pollution are the most significant factors causing the rapid decline of the creatures with whom we share our Planet. </p>
<p>By working together and changing our behaviours, we can achieve sustainable change that supports wildlife, business and the environment, and offers every inhabitant of Planet Earth a better future.</p>
<p><strong>E: Childhood Cancer Research Trust. </strong></p>
<p>The Childhood Cancer Research Trust was set up by the parents of a friend of Archie who has an aggressive form of cancer.  Archie was already working on a duet album with a fellow chorister, Myron, to raise funds for cancer in memory of Myron's grandmother when his brother was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of cancer.  Every year around 400,000 children under the age of 19 are diagnosed with cancer but even in high income countries, one in five will not survive 5 years. This new trust has been set up to raise desperately needed funds to support research into better treatments for the millions of children who must face this traumatic journey.</p>
<h3>How your support will help</h3>
<p>Your kind support will help with the costs of producing the master CD, including venue hire, instrumental accompaniment, production, engineering and editing.  We have calculated that we need £15,000 to complete the project and are setting our initial funding goal at £10,000, because this is the minimum level at which the project can proceed.  </p>
<p>In return, you will be sent a signed copy of the CD.  If you are able to be even more generous, you will be eligible for your name to be posted on the CD insert, have a personal dedication or even a piece chosen by and recorded for you, a loved one, or in memoriam, with a full dedication. </p>
<p><strong>If we raise more than we need</strong> to release the CD, Archie will donate it to one of five charitable causes (listed above) which mean something to him.  We will ask you to 'vote' for the charity that you would most like to support when you make your donation and will split any such money according to the 'votes'.</p>
<p><strong>If the funding goal is not met</strong>, your money will be returned to you or you may wish to donate it directly to one of Archie's chosen charities.</p>
<p>Archie has selected repertoire for which he has a particular love and which he feels is  representative of the theme of a progress through the music of the Baroque in its geographical context. It will include pieces both well known and a little less commonly performed to reflect a journey across Baroque Europe from Italy, through Germany and France, to England.</p>
<p>He will be accompanied by authentic period instruments by leading professional musicians to provide musical and historical integrity.</p>
<p><strong>Examples of Proposed Repertoire:</strong></p>
<p>Quia Respexit from Magnificat in D (Bach)</p>
<p>Domine Deus from Gloria (Vivaldi)</p>
<p>As when the dove from Acis and Galatea (Handel)</p>
<p>O dio se fosse vero (Bononcini)</p>
<p>Vidit suum dulcem natus from Stabat Mater (Pergolesi)</p>
<p>Cujus animam gementum (Pergolesi)</p>
<p>Dido's lament from Dido and Aeneas (Purcell)</p>
<p>How beautiful are the feet, from Messiah, (Handel)</p>
<p>Bist du bei mir (Stötzel).</p>
<p>Music for a While (Purcell)</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Archie cannot do this without your help.</p>
<p>The current restrictions have meant that he has been unable to perform in public, during what may have been the most productive year for his treble voice and he would like to distil this untapped energy into something meaningful and lasting.  The musicians who will be accompanying him have also been restricted in their opportunities to perform and the chance to collaborate is, thus, all the more exciting. </p>
<p>Through the sadness of imminent loss, yet with his eyes forward, Archie feels a connection both to the past and to the future and has a sense of the journey that this recording will represent via a musical progress through time and space.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>A project like this is ambitious for such a young musician.  Archie is aware of this and takes a very responsible and professional approach to what he is doing.  He has made recordings before and is fully aware of the long days and hard work which it involves, as well as the meticulous preparation that is required.  </p>
<p>Some of the risk lies in the very nature of a boy's treble voice on the cusp of change. Archie knows that he must look after his voice and is prepared to make many sacrifices to keep it in good condition, including avoiding tempting foods which may not support it.  The risk of voice change underpins the imperative to proceed as early as possible ad the recording is, thus, planned for this April.</p>
<p>The risk of not completing the recording is dependent upon funding, in which case donations will be refunded.  There is also the risk of unavoidable last minute change in the availability of the participants or recording venue and this will most likely be resolved by some schedule shuffling. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We completely understand that you may not be able to contribute financially to this project.  However, you can still be an enormous support to us, simply by sharing this campaign with others, through your networks, via the Indiegogo 'share' tools or by word of mouth.  All and any help is hugely appreciated.  </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Archie is 14 and has been passionate about singing all his life.  Hailing from Great Milton in Oxfordshire, he was a chorister at Magdalen College Oxford, under the baton of Mark Williams, reluctantly 'retiring' at the age of 12.  For the last eighteen months he has been studying with Maria Thompson, who prepared him successfully for his singing Diploma and for his entry into the BBC Young Chorister of the Year competition.  
Still a treble, he has continued to sing both as a soloist and collaboratively.  He has a particular love of the Baroque to early Classical periods and wishes to record, professionally, some of the music that means so much to him, before his voice changes, accompanied by authentic period instruments.  The music will represent a journey, or progress, through geography and time, across Baroque Europe.
Making this album means a great deal to Archie and whilst it may well be his 'swansong' as a treble, he hopes it might set his feet on the path to making more music with the voice that rises from its ashes. 
 Archie has been much inspired by many wonderful musicians and singers who tread the path ahead of him and he would very much like to be able to one day leave something of value on the path behind him.
Any residual funds, after the cost of recording and releasing this CD will be donated to charitable causes, including those aimed at supporting other young people starting down their own musical and life paths. 
These will be:
A: Mustardseed. 
Mustardseed’s mission is to provide an inspirational and practical education for young children, encouraging them to flourish and prosper in Uganda and the wider world.
Mustardseed School was conceived by two friends: Kenneth Buwule, a Ugandan school teacher, book editor and postgraduate scholar of peace and conflict resolution, and John Caird, a British writer and theatre director (and Magdalen College School alumnus) whose work has been performed all around the world. Kenneth and John share a deep sense of care for the health of the world in ecological and educational terms.
The name of the school is taken from the parable of the Mustardseed.  If you plant even the smallest of seeds in fertile ground, it can grow into a mighty tree that will provide a home for the birds of the air to make their nests and raise their young.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">MEGAN BLACK DEBUT ALBUM</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi everyone! For those of you who don't know me, I'm Megan Black, a singer/songwriter from Scotland. I like to think of myself as a hippy-dippy drag queen. My music usually focuses on themes of LGBTQ+ issues, female empowerment, mental health and gender expression. I love Mick Jagger, Stevie Nicks and David Byrne so I guess my music is an attempt at old rock and roll without the misogyny - but hopefully still as cool!</p>
<p>I have just released my 4th single Freedom Belongs to Him, which is the first single from my debut album which I need your help to finish! I have spent a lot of time throughout the past two years honing my songwriting skills and I cannot wait for you to hear what I have coming. I am so close to having everything ready but the lack of opportunities the past year and a bit has had a massive impact on my income which is why I need your help!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>How I Will Use The Funding</h3>
<p>I am asking for £2,000 to help me finish my debut album. This will go towards: </p>
<p>- Vinyl/CD Manufacturing </p>
<p>- Promotional Photographs (photographer)</p>
<p>- Music Video (crew)</p>
<p>- Album Artwork (graphic designer)</p>
<p>I am fortunate that I have a lot of creative friends with who I can team up with to create a lot of my content. However, they deserve to be paid fairly for their work. All other aspects are always 100% funded by myself. </p>
<h3>
<br/>What You Will Receive</h3>
<p>To thank you for your support I have a bunch of rewards that you can choose from. These include:</p>
<p>- A Signed CD (there may be a delay due to COVID) </p>
<p>- A Signed Vinyl (there may be a delay due to COVID) </p>
<p>- Digital Download (all tracks on the album) and Album Artwork (prior to the album release)</p>
<p>- Tote Bag (Freedom Belongs to Us design)</p>
<p>- T-shirt (M Logo or Megan Black Silhouette)</p>
<p>- Copy of my Lyric Book </p>
<p>- Unheard Live Session </p>
<p>- Cover of Your Choice (let me know you favourite song and I'll record audio and visuals just for you)</p>
<p>There are also bundles available for CD + Vinyl + Digital Download or Tote Bag + T-shirt or the Whole Lot.  </p>
<p>If the funding goal is not met then the release will be postponed until I am able to fund the rest. I have worked extremely hard on the tracks and they will be released but I would like to ensure that the rest of assets alongside are just as good. </p>
<p> </p>

<p>Thank you for everyone's support over the past couple of years, I am so grateful for all your love. I’m really excited for this release and I can’t wait for you guys to hear what I’ve been working on.

<p><i>Muchmusic</i> was Canada’s beating heart of pop culture, a bold, irreverent beacon that drew Canadians of all backgrounds together in their shared love of music and entertainment. </p>
<p>Until it stopped being Muchmusic and dropped all music programming.</p>
<p>Ed the Sock and his creator Steven Kerzner are putting the band back together, launching <strong>NewMusicNation</strong>, an online multi-platform interactive channel with the energy of classic Muchmusic, featuring new VJs from across the country and a focus on unsigned and independent Canadian musical artists.</p>
<p>NewMusicNation, named after the seminal Citytv/Muchmusic TV series <i>The New Music</i>, will be different from its predecessor in that it isn’t beholden to large record labels but will focus on emerging artists primarily from Canada. “When Much took the dirt nap, it left Canadian acts high and dry. We’ll bring emerging talents front-and-centre and treat them like stars.”</p>
<p>In addition to new cross-Canada VJs, ordinary Canadians can become Citizen VJs and present their chosen video music favourites. And yes, there will be a Tree Toss and Fromage show.</p>
<p>Why do we need funding? We intend to become advertiser-supported, but we first need to produce content to attract advertisers. That’s where you come in. Your support will allow us to gather the necessary resources - gear, camera ops, editors, writers, researchers, artist relations - to make a giant leap forward with NewMusicNation. </p>
<p>Plus we want to bring in advertisers after we’ve already set the tone and style of the content, rather than having them try to shape it before it launches.</p>
<p>How much money we raise will determine how much content we can start out with. If we bring in enough, we can even find a NewMusicNation HQ, like the old Much environment. In fact, we’d like a few of them across the country. But that’s Big Picture stuff.</p>
<p>Check out the numerous perks! Zoom calls with Ed, co-host a podcast with Ed, get a customized Ed video greeting card, have your life satirized with a Fromage Bio and more!</p>
<p>When we pull this off together, we’re going to be restoring a very Canadian part of our media that corporate machinations took away. It’s time to restore that Muchmusic-style mayhem for us and for younger generations.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">     The Beginning        </h3>
<p>Hello lovely person! I'm Sonny Casey. At the age of sweet sixteen I started busking on the magical streets of Galway, Ireland.</p>
<p>                                                     <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602763305/e7ywc9enbhpiteuo6a5y.jpg"" src=""""/>   <strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>                                                      </strong><i> Busking changed my life.</i></p>
<p>A whole world of freedom and expression opened up to me. It made me feel like anything was possible. I decided that as soon as I finished school I'd travel and busk my way around the world.</p>
<p>Since then I've busked and gigged across ten countries and countless cities around Europe. </p>
<div><div> </div></div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602765953/sy4hr8txujacycxdwdgc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Middle</h3>
<p>I've written lots songs along the way. But I haven't recorded an album for over two and a half years. </p>
<p>When people stop to hear me busk and ask, 'Where can I find that song you just sang?' it makes me feel like a piece is missing when I have to say 'Sorry. It hasn't been recorded yet.'</p>
<p>It's been my dream for over a year now to have my latest songs recorded professionally. I want them to sound as beautiful as possible so people can find them, hear them, feel them and maybe even love them- some place other than just live on the street!</p>
<p>Somewhere along my travels I fell madly in love with wild Berlin. I decided it's the perfect place to begin the next path of my musical journey, to plant some roots and <strong>record a new album</strong>!</p>
<p> </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The End</h3>
<p>My last album 'Pocketful of Words' was just me and guitar. For this one I want to flesh out the bones of my songs, to breathe new life into them, so for the past few weeks I've been rehearsing with five incredible musicians who I'll be introducing to you soon! </p>
<p>Now four new songs and one much-loved old song are ready to be recorded and released into the Universe.</p>
<p>At the end of November, to capture the most amount of feeling, I'll be recording five songs live in a studio, with the added magic of percussion, bass, electric guitar, strings, woodwind and keys. </p>
<p>The studio is booked, the musicians are armed, the songs are waiting. Now all we need is your help!</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>The Very Serious Bit</u></h2>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Water These Seeds</h3>
<p>To get these five songs out into the world, I'll need to pay for the studio, production, mixing and mastering, videos, photos, PR, CD printing, not to mention the musician's fees amongst other things! (see breakdown below!)</p>
<p>I've made a living from busking and gigging for the past six years and I've always had enough to get by. For this I'm deeply grateful. However, never before have I taken on a project this huge involving so many professionals. So I'm asking you to hold my hand and walk this path with me so we can water these seeds together and get this tree blooming!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Breakdown </h3>
<p>This recording business is a very costly affair. (I know, I couldn't believe it myself when I realised just how costly) From going in to the studio, to printing physical copies of the CD, to all of the magic in between, this EP is going to cost around 6,000 euro.</p>

<p>In return for you making this dream possible, I'll be giving something back. Asides from five new songs for you to listen to before anybody else, there are lots of other groovy gifts to choose from! From stickers to full band house concerts.</p>
<p>I want to make this as personal and creative as possible so I'll be drawing and writing handmade Thank You cards, writing out the lyrics to songs, hand-painting bags and T-shirts and delivering them all directly to your doorstep.</p>
<p>I'll also be learning the songs you'd love for me to cover and recording them for you, I'll even be singing to you through your laptop screen.</p>
<p>Just have a nosy to the right and see which gift feels right for you!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">...Where The Time Goes</h3>
<p>I’ve fretted over the timing of this. I’ve worried that it could be crazy to ask for help at a time of such uncertainty. But ultimately <strong>I think people need music and art now more than ever</strong>.

My first two singles 'A Saving Grace' and 'A Thousand Setting Suns' from the upcoming EP are out now, along with two music videos! 
The EP will be released on the 26th of November and I'll be sending all the crowdfunding rewards then too! 
Thank you for waiting and thank you for bringing everything to life,

WE MADE IT!
All thanks to a bunch of beautiful people whom I wish I could hug right now, we went above and beyond my goal of raising 5000 euro in 35 days for my new EP. Now the dream is becoming a reality and the new EP is on it's way!
Thank you endlessly.
                                                          
 
......................................................................................................................................................................
 
The Story
 
     The Beginning        
Hello lovely person! I'm Sonny Casey. At the age of sweet sixteen I started busking on the magical streets of Galway, Ireland.
                                                         
                                                       Busking changed my life.
A whole world of freedom and expression opened up to me. It made me feel like anything was possible. I decided that as soon as I finished school I'd travel and busk my way around the world.
Since then I've busked and gigged across ten countries and countless cities around Europe. 
 

 
The Middle
I've written lots songs along the way. But I haven't recorded an album for over two and a half years. 
When people stop to hear me busk and ask, 'Where can I find that song you just sang?' it makes me feel like a piece is missing when I have to say 'Sorry. It hasn't been recorded yet.'
It's been my dream for over a year now to have my latest songs recorded professionally. I want them to sound as beautiful as possible so people can find them, hear them, feel them and maybe even love them- some place other than just live on the street!
Somewhere along my travels I fell madly in love with wild Berlin. I decided it's the perfect place to begin the next path of my musical journey, to plant some roots and record a new album!
 

 
The End
My last album 'Pocketful of Words' was just me and guitar. For this one I want to flesh out the bones of my songs, to breathe new life into them, so for the past few weeks I've been rehearsing with five incredible musicians who I'll be introducing to you soon! 
Now four new songs and one much-loved old song are ready to be recorded and released into the Universe.
At the end of November, to capture the most amount of feeling, I'll be recording five songs live in a studio, with the added magic of percussion, bass, electric guitar, strings, woodwind and keys. 
The studio is booked, the musicians are armed, the songs are waiting. Now all we need is your help!
 
➳➳➳➳➳┄┄※┄┄➳➳➳➳➳
The Very Serious Bit
 
Water These Seeds
To get these five songs out into the world, I'll need to pay for the studio, production, mixing and mastering, videos, photos, PR, CD printing, not to mention the musician's fees amongst other things! (see breakdown below!)
I've made a living from busking and gigging for the past six years and I've always had enough to get by. For this I'm deeply grateful. However, never before have I taken on a project this huge involving so many professionals. So I'm asking you to hold my hand and walk this path with me so we can water these seeds together and get this tree blooming!
 

Breakdown 
This recording business is a very costly affair. (I know, I couldn't believe it myself when I realised just how costly) From going in to the studio, to printing physical copies of the CD, to all of the magic in between, this EP is going to cost around 6,000 euro.
Here's where all your kind donations will go:


Studio & Sound Engineer:  500/day x 2 days =           1,000


Mixing & Mastering:  120/song x 5 songs =                      600


Musicians:  200/day x 2 days x 5 musicians =              2,000


CD Printing (with lyric booklet): 300 CDs =                      600


Postage (sending CDs and merch):                                  200


Photos & Video: (campaign video & live studio video)   500


Merchandise: (t-shirts, bags, stickers, posters)               200


PR (reaching people so you can find out about this!)      500


Indiegogo Service Fee: (5%)                                                  250  

Payment Processing Fee: (3%)                                             150                                                                                                                                                                _________


                                                                                                                = 6,000                                                                                                                                                    _________
 (I'll pay 1,000 with savings from busking and gigging)        - 1,000                                                                                                                                                                           _________
                                       Total:   5,000

Extra Bits & Bobs
 
   For You Dear  
In return for you making this dream possible, I'll be giving something back. Asides from five new songs for you to listen to before anybody else, there are lots of other groovy gifts to choose from! From stickers to full band house concerts.
I want to make this as personal and creative as possible so I'll be drawing and writing handmade Thank You cards, writing out the lyrics to songs, hand-painting bags and T-shirts and delivering them all directly to your doorstep.
I'll also be learning the songs you'd love for me to cover and recording them for you, I'll even be singing to you through your laptop screen.
Just have a nosy to the right and see which gift feels right for you!
 
...Where The Time Goes
I’ve fretted over the timing of this. I’ve worried that it could be crazy to ask for help at a time of such uncertainty. But ultimately I think people need music and art now more than ever. It was evident right from the start, when we all teared up watching videos of Italian folk singing and playing music from their lonely balconies.
The studio is booked for the 21st and 22nd of November so we're looking forward to sharing the recording process with you here and on social media!
The month of December will be for mixing, mastering, polishing everything off and the first single will hopefully be released around the end of January 2021.
The rest of the songs will be released one by one and then the whole EP will be available by Autumn 2021.
If you choose to be a part of this project you'll get to hear all the songs before they're released- way before the rest of the world!

Why This Means The Moon To Me: 
Music is how I connect to myself and others. It's this special place to reach and touch people that goes beyond anything we could ever say with words.
I'd love for all the people I've connected with through music to have a record of my latest songs sounding as lovely as possible. 
I'd love to be able to reach more people than just those that see me busking on the street.
And I'd love for those I do meet busking to be able to take a little piece of the moment home with them in the form of a new CD.
It’s been the most rewarding journey rehearsing with these musicians. I can’t describe in words how explosively beautiful it feels to have them add their magic to these songs. I’m so excited to share them with you! 
 

 
Thank You to the End of the Universe and Back:
Anything you can afford to give will help enormously. Be it five euro or five billion. If you're not in the position to give anything then that's okay- spreading the word also helps! Share this with your friends and family or anyone else you know!
I hope you can be a part of bringing this EP to life.
It's time to get these songs off my chest and have them sounding as lovely as possible so they can fill your ears and hearts and souls and be a warm hug of sunshine for you when winter comes!

Hi everyone, my name is Peter Tijerina and I'm a trombonist, educator, arranger, and composer. I have performed with the Sidewalk Stompers, Katie Flynn Cabaret, Lansing Symphony Jazz Band, Milonga and Son Dulce latin bands, Coeur d'Alene Symphony, and Olympia Symphony Orchestra. Most recently, I taught jazz arranging and trombone at Lincoln College and my nonet currently (before pandemic) occupies a monthly residency at The Iron Post in Urbana, IL.The ProjectJust Yesterday is my debut album and is a reflection of my life up until the date we recorded it, including my experiences with love, loss, adventures with family & friends, and my journey from San Antonio, Texas to Washington state (East and West) to Michigan. I'm super excited to be sharing this music and to be playing with phenomenal musicians! In addition to a few American songbook standard tunes, there are original compositions by myself, Corey Kendrick (piano), Diego Rivera (tenor sax), and Lucas Pino (NYC-based tenor saxophonist and composer). Since producing and releasing an album are quite expensive, I am asking for your support to help cover as much of the costs as possible. Any amount of contribution is GREATLY appreciated! Don't forget to check out the perks/rewards (listed below), they are cumulative (e.g., if you select the ""Name on Album Credits"" option, you also get an Album Print Shirt, a signed CD, and a digital download.)! I love to give what I can to the music community, but I can't do this project without your support! The Album Crew

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Peace Stage</h3>
<p align=""center"">Neruda Art's Mobile Stage - Built for the people - by the people.</p>
<p align=""center"">Every project needs a foundation.</p>
<p align=""center"">This project needs your help!</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>We are aiming to raise $5432.00 toward the construction of a mobile stage.</strong></p>
<p align=""center"">With a mobile stage - Neruda Arts can bring music, theatre, and dance to the community, especially outlying communities and those with little access to the arts.</p>
<p>First - a bit about us. Neruda Arts, established in 2001 by Founding Artistic Director, Isabel Cisterna, is a non-profit world-music presenter dedicated to building bridges in the community through music, dance, drama, and literary and visual arts.</p>
<p>Each summer, Neruda Arts presents it's signature event, Kultrún World Music Festival – a free, two-day festival in Victoria Park. Live music from all over the world, as well as local and national bands, plays all weekend - a virtual smorgasbord of culture. This event also highlights arts and crafts people, workshops and interactive events, dance, theatre, food of the world, and in 2019, introduced a concert designed for the deaf and hard of hearing, Feel the Music.</p>
<p>Aside from Kultrún, throughout the year Neruda presents smaller festivals, concerts, establishes panels, facilitates conversation regarding social issues, youth workshops, and creates interactive events with a focus on inclusion.  Neruda Arts educates and introduces the community to a more all-embracing attitude regarding multiculturalism, issues of racism and exclusion.</p>
<p>During the past twenty years, Neruda Arts has been a champion to emerging, mid-career and professional artists, often mentoring and encouraging them in their pursuit of life in the arts.</p>
<p>We have learned a lot through the challenges of COVID-19.  We shifted our focus to support the artists in a way that is best achieved, at this time, through social media. We have just equipped an audio/visual studio called Sound on Sound (SOS), where we have the tools to further the careers of local musicians and more. Yet, we are profoundly aware there are still people left out, not included in the arts, often because of their situation, whether it be mobility, financial or the pandemic itself.</p>
<p>This is where the PEACE STAGE comes in.</p>

<p><strong>If you help us build it, we will come.</strong></p>
<p>With some very able artisans, notably Sandra Dunn of Two Smiths, we are in the midst of constructing a mobile stage. Mobile. We have visions of bringing music to smaller communities, to day care, schools, retirement homes, small outdoor venues – we have a million ideas. Luckily, we don't need a million dollars.</p>
<p><strong>IMPACT</strong></p>
<p>Imagine bringing music to smaller towns, that don't enjoy concerts and art happening in their own communities, or bringing music to shut-ins, youth and people who are financially challenged.</p>
<p>We are asking for donations, not just because we need your financial help, but because we want you, in our  community, to feel THE PEOPLE'S STAGE is YOUR STAGE.</p>

<p>These times have been challenging, we know - for all of us. Please don't donate if you, yourself, are struggling. We haven't a lot of perks to offer - but we do have our love and appreciation for all of you. For anyone who donates $200 or more, you will be invited to an exclusive dinner party at the Isabel Cisterna's home (first 16 only) with LIVE MUSIC!

<h3><strong>Meet Noe Venable</strong></h3>
<p>✨     Special <strong>bonus gift </strong> -  <strong>two unreleased songs</strong>!  These songs will not be available elsewhere, and you'll receive them in addition to your chosen perk when you contribute any time between now and the end of the campaign.  I'm excited to share these with you!</p>
<p>Also, to hear some of the <strong>music</strong> from this album, just click the ""<strong>updates</strong>"" tab, above!     ✨</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hello friends!  </p>
<p>In case you're new to my music, let me introduce myself.</p>
<p>My name is Noe Venable.  (Yes, that's my real name!)  </p>
<p>I'm an independent <strong>singer-songwriter</strong> and <strong>recording artist</strong> from <strong>San Francisco, California</strong>.  You might know me from my earlier releases, <strong>The World is Bound by Secret Knots, The Summer Storm Journals, Boots, </strong>or<strong> Cascadia.</strong></p>
<p>I create <strong>ethereal progressive folk music.</strong>   Songs to <strong>awaken magic</strong> and <strong>connect to your wild soul</strong>.     </p>
<p>I'm here today to invite you to <strong>join me as a co-creator </strong>of my<strong> new album,</strong> <strong>Gift of Embers. </strong> </p>
<p>But first, I want to tell you the story of how this project came to be.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, something surprising happened to me.</p>
<p>I fell in love with an instrument.  <strong>The Celtic harp.</strong></p>
<p>The timing was not ideal.  As a busy mother of two young children, I barely had time to wash my hair, let alone take up a new instrument. </p>
<p>But passion won out.  Pretty soon, I was rearranging my life to prioritize learning to play.</p>
<p>As I played, <strong>the songs began to come.  </strong></p>
<p>Songs that were wild.  Tender.  Majestic. </p>
<p>And, like the harp itself, <strong>not quite of this world.</strong></p>
<p>Of course, <strong>songwriting wasn't new to me</strong>.  I'd been a singer-songwriter for decades.  I'd <strong>toured the world</strong>, been <strong>nominated for awards</strong>, seen my music <strong>featured in film</strong> and enjoyed a fulfilling career as a fully independent artist.  </p>
<p>But with the harp, I discovered <strong>a well of inspiration</strong> I'd not felt in many years - not since, as a teenager, I first picked up the guitar.</p>
<p>With the reckless surrender of new love, I gave myself over to this interest completely.  Before I knew it,  I was deep in the recording process, on a wild, determined mission to create my first ever <strong>harp-based singer-songwriter album</strong>.</p>
<p>The fruit of this labor is <strong>my new record, Gift of Embers.</strong> </p>
<p>As I write, the album is nearly finished.  All that remains are a few crucial steps. </p>
<p>But to finish those steps, <strong>I need your help.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>What We Need</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Writing music and releasing albums is my passion.</strong>  Unfortunately, it's also a pretty expensive habit to maintain.  As a person of limited financial means, (and especially since the advent of streaming sites) there is really only <strong>one way</strong> I can continue to do what I do, and that is with the <strong>support of listeners like you.</strong></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">So here's how it works.  When you contribute to this campaign, you can <strong>join the creation</strong> of this album, and help me get this album into your hands by <strong>summer of 2021.</strong></span></p>
<p>So let's talk about the money.</p>
<p>My campaign goal is <strong>$20,000. </strong>  </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Now, in case that number made you do a double take (as it did for me when I added it all up!) I want to<strong> break it down for you here</strong>, and show you where the money goes. </span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1611250287/mizkyhbhkjgyn5wdk7is.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>You'll notice that the largest expenses are <strong>paying musicians </strong>and<strong> recording engineers</strong> (everyone but myself, that is!) and <strong>paying for studio time</strong>, with additional resources allocated to <strong>package design</strong> and <strong>campaign expenses.</strong></p>
<p>Some of these expenses are things I've already invested in, and some are yet to be incurred.</p>
<p>My campaign goal of <strong>$20,000 </strong>covers<strong> </strong>a portion of what has already been spent, as well as the <b>remaining steps </b>of <strong>mixing</strong>, <strong>mastering, </strong>and<strong> having the album pressed.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Stretch goal - $25,000  </strong>  If we reach this amount, I will also be able to <strong>release the album on vinyl</strong>, too.  (I'd love to be able to do this!)</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>The Creators</strong></h3>
<p>To give you a sense of how much <strong>talent</strong>, <strong>skill</strong> and <strong>vision</strong> has gone into this album, let me introduce my collaborators.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613337264/ghgqsuv75uv8thejldhw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Todd Sickafoose <i>(co-arranger, bass, piano, keyboards, synths)</i></strong>  Todd is a <strong>Tony award winning</strong> <strong>bassist, multi-instrumentalist,</strong> and <strong>producer</strong> who has recorded and played bass with many genre bending folk artists including <strong>Ani DiFranco</strong>, <strong>Anais Mitchell</strong>, and <strong>Andrew Bird</strong>.  The consistency of his personal voice within wildly diverse collaborations prompted the<strong> LA Weekly</strong> to call Todd ""one of the most comprehensive musical minds of the West coast"". </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613336713/sjctv2hoidrtmqxhnzsf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Mathias Kunzli </strong> <i><strong>(drums, percussion) </strong></i>  Mathias is a wildly inventive and supremely groovy drummer, and a joy to work with.  Hailing from Switzerland, Mathias is equally at home playing <strong>frame drums</strong> and <strong>world music instruments</strong> as he is rocking out on a <strong>drum kit</strong>.   Mathias's prior collaborators have included <strong>Moby, Lauryn Hill, Yo-Yo Ma Silk Road Ensemble</strong>, <strong>John Zorn</strong> and <strong>Regina Spektor</strong>, to name a few.</p>

<p><strong>Adam Levy<i> (electric guitar) </i></strong> Even if you don't know Adam by name, you've probably heard his playing on hit songs like <strong>Norah Jones'</strong> multi-platinum song “Come Away With Me”  and <strong>Tracy Chapman’s</strong> “Give Me One Reason to Stay Here.”  Also an accomplished songwriter in his own right, Adam always knows just how to serve a song.  I can't wait for you to hear what he added to this record!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613336952/feraun60fqc2f8ccf2jd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Alan Lin</strong>  <i><strong>(violin)  </strong></i>Alan and I met in our early twenties and have played together ever since.   In addition to supporting songwriters like me, Alan can be found soloing in the <strong>San Francisco jazz scene,</strong> and he also composes gorgeous <strong>music for meditation</strong>.  (He's a pretty dead-on astrologer, too...  ;)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613336989/h3qj33i0wcgt6ymkjnyw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Adam Muñoz</strong> <i><strong>(mixing)  </strong></i>Adam mixed an early album of mine, and I'm so excited to work with him again!  Adam's mixing credits include <strong>The Cranberries, Johanna Newsom, Chris Isaak</strong>, <strong>Bonnie Raitt, Dave Matthews,</strong><strong> Bill Frisell </strong>and so many more.  He's a total pro, and his touch is really going to take these songs to the next level!</p>
<h3><strong>Additional Collaborators:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Alan Douches</strong> <i><strong>(mastering) </strong></i>  As a mastering engineer, Alan has 25+ years experience.  During that time, He has mastered over 16,000 albums with artists in practically every genre of music.  A few notable credits include: <strong>Sufjan Stevens, Fleetwood Mac</strong> and <strong>Yes</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Hill</strong> <i><strong>(additional audio engineering) </strong></i>Jeff Hill is a  <strong>bassist, producer and recording engineer</strong> based in Brooklyn, New York.  He has worked with many notable musicians and recording artists throughout the years, both on stage and in the studio.  Some of Jeff's prior collaborators include <strong>Linda Thompson, Joan Baez, Rufus Wainwright</strong>,  <strong>Paula Cole,</strong>  and <strong>Kate </strong>and<strong> Anna McGarrigle</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Chloe Jackman</strong> <i><strong>(album photo shoot)   </strong></i>Photographer <strong>Chloe Jackman</strong> is the woman behind our last two professional photo shoots. She's awesome - an incredibly talented photographer who's also really adept at putting people at ease behind the camera.  I can't wait to work with her again!</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Marton O’Brien, A.K.A. Lumina Noctis</strong> <i><strong>(artist, Tree of Life image)</strong></i>  Lindsey is the painter, artist and graphic designer who created one of the iconic images that goes along with this music - the <strong>Tree of Life.</strong>  As a hobbyist botanical perfumer, she also creates handmade perfumes and skincare inspired by the seasons, as well as limited edition shirt designs, art prints, and more.</p>

<p><strong>Your name, sung by the sea -</strong> For contributors at ALL LEVELS, I am planning a fun way to honor your contribution.  I will take a trip to the shore with the names of all who contributed and sing them aloud to the sea.  I'll let you know when this is happening, and I'll also photograph this ritual, and share the photograph online.  </p>
<p>And <strong>more special surprises</strong> to be announced as we go, so <strong>stay tuned!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>With your support,  I know can deliver you <strong>an album like no other.  </strong></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I love this album</span><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">, and <strong>I think you're going to love it too</strong>, especially for</span><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> those solitary moments when you're feeling <strong>creative, tender, inspired</strong>...  For listening to <strong>in the bath by candle light</strong>, while <strong>working at your easel</strong>, or taking a <strong>solitary walk</strong> through the woods.</span></p>
<p>So first and foremost, this is about the music.</p>
<p>But it's about more than that, too.</p>
<p>Because when you support a campaign like this, you're not just supporting a single project or artist.  You're supporting a world where independent artists can <strong>continue to make art</strong>, and where that art can <strong>reach the folks it's meant for</strong>.  Simple.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>Well, let me start by telling you about my track record.  As an independent artist, I've released <strong>more than 16 albums</strong> over the course of my career.  (Some for grown ups, and some for children.)</p>
<p>So I've got some experience with this...  ;)</p>
<p>The challenges with a campaign like this really just boil down to timing.  When it comes to production and CD duplication, things can take longer than expected, so it's always possible I'll need to ask for your patience if the supply chain gets held up and I can't make my hoped for release timeline of early summer.</p>
<p>The other risk has to do with the campaign goal itself.  If we reach this goal, I'll be all set with the needed resources to release this album ASAP.<br/><br/>If we don't reach the goal, I'll still release the album and fulfill all rewards, but it could take longer, since I'd then need to find another way to raise the needed funds.</p>
<p>But let's not go there...  </p>
<p>I'm determined to make this happen!  And together, I believe we can make it be!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>

Hello friends!  
In case you're new to my music, let me introduce myself.
My name is Noe Venable.  (Yes, that's my real name!)  
I'm an independent singer-songwriter and recording artist from San Francisco, California.  You might know me from my earlier releases, The World is Bound by Secret Knots, The Summer Storm Journals, Boots, or Cascadia.
I create ethereal progressive folk music.   Songs to awaken magic and connect to your wild soul.     
I'm here today to invite you to join me as a co-creator of my new album, Gift of Embers.  
But first, I want to tell you the story of how this project came to be.
A couple of years ago, something surprising happened to me.
I fell in love with an instrument.  The Celtic harp.
The timing was not ideal.  As a busy mother of two young children, I barely had time to wash my hair, let alone take up a new instrument. 
But passion won out.  Pretty soon, I was rearranging my life to prioritize learning to play.
As I played, the songs began to come.  
Songs that were wild.  Tender.  Majestic. 
And, like the harp itself, not quite of this world.
Of course, songwriting wasn't new to me.  I'd been a singer-songwriter for decades.  I'd toured the world, been nominated for awards, seen my music featured in film and enjoyed a fulfilling career as a fully independent artist.  
But with the harp, I discovered a well of inspiration I'd not felt in many years - not since, as a teenager, I first picked up the guitar.
With the reckless surrender of new love, I gave myself over to this interest completely.  Before I knew it,  I was deep in the recording process, on a wild, determined mission to create my first ever harp-based singer-songwriter album.
The fruit of this labor is my new record, Gift of Embers. 
As I write, the album is nearly finished.  All that remains are a few crucial steps. 
But to finish those steps, I need your help.
 

What We Need
Writing music and releasing albums is my passion.  Unfortunately, it's also a pretty expensive habit to maintain.  As a person of limited financial means, (and especially since the advent of streaming sites) there is really only one way I can continue to do what I do, and that is with the support of listeners like you.
So here's how it works.  When you contribute to this campaign, you can join the creation of this album, and help me get this album into your hands by summer of 2021.
So let's talk about the money.
My campaign goal is $20,000.   
Now, in case that number made you do a double take (as it did for me when I added it all up!) I want to break it down for you here, and show you where the money goes. 

You'll notice that the largest expenses are paying musicians and recording engineers (everyone but myself, that is!) and paying for studio time, with additional resources allocated to package design and campaign expenses.
Some of these expenses are things I've already invested in, and some are yet to be incurred.
My campaign goal of $20,000 covers a portion of what has already been spent, as well as the remaining steps of mixing, mastering, and having the album pressed. 
Stretch goal - $25,000    If we reach this amount, I will also be able to release the album on vinyl, too.  (I'd love to be able to do this!)
 

The Creators
To give you a sense of how much talent, skill and vision has gone into this album, let me introduce my collaborators.

Todd Sickafoose (co-arranger, bass, piano, keyboards, synths)  Todd is a Tony award winning bassist, multi-instrumentalist, and producer who has recorded and played bass with many genre bending folk artists including Ani DiFranco, Anais Mitchell, and Andrew Bird.  The consistency of his personal voice within wildly diverse collaborations prompted the LA Weekly to call Todd ""one of the most comprehensive musical minds of the West coast"". 

Mathias Kunzli  (drums, percussion)   Mathias is a wildly inventive and supremely groovy drummer, and a joy to work with.  Hailing from Switzerland, Mathias is equally at home playing frame drums and world music instruments as he is rocking out on a drum kit.   Mathias's prior collaborators have included Moby, Lauryn Hill, Yo-Yo Ma Silk Road Ensemble, John Zorn and Regina Spektor, to name a few.

Adam Levy (electric guitar)  Even if you don't know Adam by name, you've probably heard his playing on hit songs like Norah Jones' multi-platinum song “Come Away With Me”  and Tracy Chapman’s “Give Me One Reason to Stay Here.”  Also an accomplished songwriter in his own right, Adam always knows just how to serve a song.  I can't wait for you to hear what he added to this record!

Alan Lin  (violin)  Alan and I met in our early twenties and have played together ever since.   In addition to supporting songwriters like me, Alan can be found soloing in the San Francisco jazz scene, and he also composes gorgeous music for meditation.  (He's a pretty dead-on astrologer, too...  ;)

Adam Muñoz (mixing)  Adam mixed an early album of mine, and I'm so excited to work with him again!  Adam's mixing credits include The Cranberries, Johanna Newsom, Chris Isaak, Bonnie Raitt, Dave Matthews, Bill Frisell and so many more.  He's a total pro, and his touch is really going to take these songs to the next level!
Additional Collaborators:
Alan Douches (mastering)   As a mastering engineer, Alan has 25+ years experience.  During that time, He has mastered over 16,000 albums with artists in practically every genre of music.  A few notable credits include: Sufjan Stevens, Fleetwood Mac and Yes.
Jeff Hill (additional audio engineering) Jeff Hill is a  bassist, producer and recording engineer based in Brooklyn, New York.  He has worked with many notable musicians and recording artists throughout the years, both on stage and in the studio.  Some of Jeff's prior collaborators include Linda Thompson, Joan Baez, Rufus Wainwright,  Paula Cole,  and Kate and Anna McGarrigle.
Chloe Jackman (album photo shoot)   Photographer Chloe Jackman is the woman behind our last two professional photo shoots. She's awesome - an incredibly talented photographer who's also really adept at putting people at ease behind the camera.  I can't wait to work with her again!
Lindsey Marton O’Brien, A.K.A. Lumina Noctis (artist, Tree of Life image)  Lindsey is the painter, artist and graphic designer who created one of the iconic images that goes along with this music - the Tree of Life.  As a hobbyist botanical perfumer, she also creates handmade perfumes and skincare inspired by the seasons, as well as limited edition shirt designs, art prints, and more.
 
What You Get
Ok, now here's the fun part.  ;)
What do you get when you support this campaign?
 
The Music
Well, first and foremost you'll get the finished album itself, (physical CD or digital album download), long before it's released to the general public.   
In addition, higher pledge levels come with a limited edition bonus recording featuring solo demos of the songs.  
If you're new to my music, you can choose to own my prior releases, while musicians may enjoy my set of two songbooks with chords, fretboard diagrams, and some tablature.
Families with young children may also choose to treat their little ones to the children's albums which accompany my children's music class Noe's Garden, 
Special Extras
At the higher pledge levels,  you'll find all kinds of limited edition and one of a kind extras, integrating your suggestions.
Here are some highlights:
Tree of life T-shirt or Hoodie, featuring our beautiful Tree of Life image created by Lindsey Márton O'Brien of Lumina Noctis.  This image is also available on a 16 x 16 inch silk or synthetic altar or Tarot cloth in several choices of color.

 
For Seekers - Renew your sacred space with the Tree of Life altar cloth, two different crystals, and a drawstring pouch handmade by Noe to stow your spiritual supplies.
For Collectors - Framed, handwritten lyrics to the NV song of your choice.
For Writers - Beautiful nature-inspired journals, designed by Noe, and perfect to tuck in a satchel for a day of writing in the wilds.  
Soul Support -  Join me one on one for a 60 minute one on one session, and let's get to know each other.  Creative coaching?  Spiritual counseling?  Deep listening?  Uncovering your singing voice?  I have experience in all of these areas, and  I'd love to support you.  
For music lovers - A personalized online or in person solo concert for you and your friends!
For families -  I will compose an original song for your child on the topic of their choice (or yours.)  
Credit in the liner notes by name, or anonymously as you wish.
Your name, sung by the sea - For contributors at ALL LEVELS, I am planning a fun way to honor your contribution.  I will take a trip to the shore with the names of all who contributed and sing them aloud to the sea.  I'll let you know when this is happening, and I'll also photograph this ritual, and share the photograph online.  
And more special surprises to be announced as we go, so stay tuned!
 
The Impact
With your support,  I know can deliver you an album like no other.  
I love this album, and I think you're going to love it too, especially for those solitary moments when you're feeling creative, tender, inspired...  For listening to in the bath by candle light, while working at your easel, or taking a solitary walk through the woods.
So first and foremost, this is about the music.
But it's about more than that, too.
Because when you support a campaign like this, you're not just supporting a single project or artist.  You're supporting a world where independent artists can continue to make art, and where that art can reach the folks it's meant for.  Simple.  
 

Risks & Challenges
Well, let me start by telling you about my track record.  As an independent artist, I've released more than 16 albums over the course of my career.  (Some for grown ups, and some for children.)
So I've got some experience with this...  ;)
The challenges with a campaign like this really just boil down to timing.  When it comes to production and CD duplication, things can take longer than expected, so it's always possible I'll need to ask for your patience if the supply chain gets held up and I can't make my hoped for release timeline of early summer.
The other risk has to do with the campaign goal itself.  If we reach this goal, I'll be all set with the needed resources to release this album ASAP.If we don't reach the goal, I'll still release the album and fulfill all rewards, but it could take longer, since I'd then need to find another way to raise the needed funds.
But let's not go there...  
I'm determined to make this happen!  And together, I believe we can make it be!
 

Other Ways You Can Help
