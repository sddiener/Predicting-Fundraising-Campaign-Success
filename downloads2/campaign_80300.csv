It's all about the BAND, Elwood. The BAND.</p>
<p>Jess Novak and Brian Golden found each other when they first jammed on a festival stage in July of 2013. Novak was in the middle of making her solo album, <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/bad-habit/id789815254"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bad Habit</a>, and it was missing something - she decided that something was Brian Golden. Since then, the duo has toured from Vermont to Florida, released that solo album (in Dec. 2013), <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/the-golden-novak-band/id913718373"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">a full band album</a> (in Sept. 2014) and formally started The Golden Novak Band (in June 2014).</p>
<p>Less than a year later, the duo (now joined by another songwriter/multi-instrumentalist, Mark Nanni), has more than THREE ALBUMS worth of ORIGINAL material (that's more than 30 songs), a new van to pay off and lofty goals. The GNB train is moving - FAST - and it needs YOUR HELP to keep chugging. </p> </div> <div> <h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><p></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>SassafraZ debuted January 2011 with one goal in mind: bring a heavy dose of ambitious yet likably fresh music to the public with a special interest in people who want to rock hard but still like to shake a posterior now and then. We have been entertaining audiences from the stage for the past five years by playing hundreds of shows for thousands of satisfied concert-goers. Our group has played in every major city from Gainesville FL to Toronto, Ontario, even stopping in Manhattan to record a live album at The Bitter End. SassafraZ is nothing short of a song writing powerhouse; a veritable 6-person Brill Building (though we don’t have Carol King, God bless that woman). We have continuously brought new tunes to our shows which range in style from prog to jazz rock fusian, funk, soul, jam, and straight up rock and roll.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fans have been begging us for a new CD to throw in their cars and computers so in response we hit the studio for three days and recorded as much material as we could spending all the money we had. 30 hours of studio time at Columbus’ very own Sonic Lounge (Bless you, Viers, Damron, and Davis) have yielded us 20 tracks of material, but it simply wasn’t enough time to record any vocals or wind instruments, and we still need to lay down synthesizers and a few electric piano tracks. What we have right now are 20 beautiful songs with drums, bass, guitars, and some light electric piano waiting to be finished up and printed. The only thing standing between us and giving the people what they want: Money. The writing process never stops, either. By the time we print the next wave of CD’s we will be looking to record our next batch of 20 songs. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are setting our goal at $10,000. We have already invested $2,000 on initial tracking, and we expect the final budget to exceed $15,000. Here is a basic breakdown of our expenses:</p>
<p>TRACKING</p>
<p>$2,000 - Drums, bass, guitar, keys (already done)</p>
<p>$1,500 - Vocals (3  days)</p>
<p>$1,000 - Horns (2 days)</p>
<p>$1,000 - Guitar/keys overdubs (2 days)</p>
<p>MIXING/MASTERING </p>
<p>$5,000 (estimated cost at $50 an hour—5 hours per song)</p>
<p>MANUFACTURING/DISTRIBUTION/ADVERTISING</p>
<p>$5,000</p>
<p>ESTIMATED TOTAL </p>
<p>$15,500 </p>
<h3>Rewards</h3>
<p>We have compiled a bunch of goofily named rewards. We have a variety of packages with lots of fun stuff, some of which is ONLY available right here.</p>
<p>Rewards FAQ - for more detailed information about a particular reward package, send an email to sassafrazmusic@gmail.com and put REWARDS FAQ in the subject line. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With the release of new CD’s we are afforded the opportunity to make back every dollar spent and then put that money back into the music as we continue to write and hopefully record our material into countless new CD’s. Our goal is to release 20 tracks to the public every year. By contributing to this campaign you will not only help us finish this current project but you will be jumpstarting a process in which we create more fresh, beautiful, original music that will eventually reach the entire globe.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We Have always been susceptible to bear attacks but considering the bear population in Ohio there is no real risk involved here. We also have a full stock of bear mace, just in case. If you are worried about the quality of our product then you must listen to our debut album Time Will Tell. That album is a promise to the world that we will make pristine products with an unparalleled level of technological and musical quality.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>It is possible that you’ve read everything on this page leading up to here but you already know you cannot contribute money at this time. We thank you for your interest and want you to know that it would mean the world to us if you used the share tools on this website to help spread the word.

<h3> Why our station is in danger?</h3>
<p></p>From the very beginning, Poptastic Radio has been broadcast on a free 
streaming platform providing music catalogue and covering royalty fees, 
in exchange for advertising spaces. Perfect to embark on such a project 
but insufficient for further development.<br/><b>Moreover, following administrative and financial issues, our streaming provider decided to geo-block radio stations (including Poptastic Radio) broadcasting in many countries and remove access to their music library.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, we can no longer work in those conditions<b> and that's why the very existence of the station is now uncertain.</b><br/>So we need to find a new professional streaming platform and reconstruct a music library very soon (up to now 80% of our music catalogue were provided by this streaming provider).<br/></b><br/>
</div><div>
<h3> What do we need to continue?<br/>
</h3>
<p></p>Our aim is to raise funds to cover migration costs (<b>streaming and the purchase of a music library</b>), as well as operating costs for a year (<b>hosting, purchase of new titles, cover the royalty fees, advertising</b>). Advertising thus far imposed by the current provider (and from which we do not benefit in any way) will be replaced by the sale of advertising space limited to 2 x 2 min per hour and revenues generated in this manner will gradually replace the collected funds, in order to ensure the radio’s financial autonomy expected in the following year. The remaining income is generated through merchandising and contributions of the radio’s active members.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463221636/music-library-by-unsplash_kozmcd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><b>More specifically, our project rests on three major axes.</b><br/>Our goal is to raise USD 15,400. Funds will be dedicated to a number of purposes:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>
<b>Internet Radio streaming (including royalty fees)</b> <br/>Raising funds in order to enter into a streaming structure on a commercial platform that is recognized for the quality of its services, its dynamism and responsiveness. This is the very foundation of our own activities. Like any other radio station, <b>Poptastic Radio strives to be broadcast without interruption and provide its listeners with an excellent sound quality.</b><br/>Amount: USD 3,600</li>
<li>
<b>Music</b><br/>To date, 90% of the music we broadcast comes from the music library made available to us by the platform from which we intend to retire. <b>We are, therefore, obliged to replenish our catalogue by purchasing the titles we used to play and regularly add new music to our collection.</b> As we wish to respect copyright, we will abstain from illegal downloads. This represents a great investment, as our playlist currently consists of approximately 3,000 titles.<br/>Amount: USD 5,800</li>
<li>
<b>Advertising</b><br/>The success and sustainability of an undertaking like ours requires advertising and permanent visibility. <b>Your efforts, combined with ours, will only be rewarded if we manage to attract a loyal and growing audience</b>; this, however, requires a viable and efficient advertising campaign.

<p></p>
<span>Depuis le début, Poptastic Radio est diffusée sur une plateforme de streaming gratuite fournissant catalogue de musique et couvrant les frais de redevances, en échange d'espaces publicitaires.

<p></p>Notre démarche vise à collecter des fonds pour <strong>couvrir les frais de migration (streaming et acquisition d'une librairie musicale)</strong> ainsi que les frais de fonctionnement pour une année <strong>(hébergement, achat de nouveaux titres, droits d'auteurs, communication)</strong>. La publicité, actuellement imposée par le prestataire actuel (sur laquelle nous ne bénéficions d'aucun reversement) sera remplacée par la vente en interne d'espaces publicitaires limités à 2 x 2 mn par heure, dont les revenus vont progressivement se substituer aux fonds collectés sur IndieGogo, jusqu'à garantir l'autofinancement de la radio, dès l'année suivante.

<br/>Notre but est de collecter USD 15,400 (environ 13,600 €). <br/><b>Plus précisément, notre projet à ce jour est basé sur trois axes importants.</b><br/>Les contributions seront utilisées selon ces différentes façons :<br/><br/><ul>
<li>
<b>Streaming audio et droits d'auteur</b> <br/>Récolter des fonds pour intégrer une nouvelle structure de diffusion en streaming sur une plateforme payante connue et reconnue pour la qualité de ses services, son dynamisme et sa réactivité.

<b>Montant : USD 3,600 (environ 3200 €)</b>
</li>
<li>
<b>Musique (discothèque)</b><br/>Notre programmation est, à ce jour, constituée à 90% de titres provenant de la librairie musicale mis à notre disposition par la plateforme dont nous souhaitons nous séparer. Nous sommes donc dans l'obligation de <b>reconstituer ce catalogue</b> en achetant l'ensemble des titres qui le composent et de l'enrichir régulièrement de nouveaux titres. Comme nous tenons à respecter le principe du droit d'auteur, il n'est pas question pour nous de procéder à des téléchargements illégaux. Par conséquent, cela représente un investissement important car notre programmation est actuellement composée d'environ 3000 titres.<br/>
<b>Montant : USD 5,800 (environ 5100 €)</b>
</li>
<li>
<b>Communication</b><br/>
La réussite et la pérennité d'une entreprise comme celle-ci passe par la
communication et une visibilité permanente. <b>Vos efforts et nos efforts ne seront récompensés que par une audience fidèle et grandissante</b>, que nous n'obtiendrons pas si nous faisons l'impasse sur la <b>communication</b>. C'est une erreur fréquente que nous constatons dans d'autres projets similaires. Nous voulons l'éviter. La visibilité de Poptastic Radio, comme tout autre entreprise, passe par la communication traditionnelle : flyers, affiches, partenariats et bien évidemment et en priorité <strong>la publicité en ligne</strong>. C'est aussi pour cela que nous avons besoins de fonds.<br/>
<b>Montant : USD 6,000 (environ 5300 €)</b>

Notre concept s'appuie aussi sur l'idée de limiter les bavardages et de proposer des playlists ""fabriquées à la main"", parce que nous sommes persuadés qu'aucun algorithme au monde ne remplacera l'expertise et le feeling d'un humain. 




L'équipe



L'équipe est composée de spécialistes professionnels de la radio ou amateurs, tous véritables passionnés de musiques :




Miss G., présentatrice et productrice anglaise. Miss G présente une pastille, diffusée plusieurs fois dans la semaine, sur l'actualité de la scène Pop à Londres et au Royaume-Uni. 

Paula, jeune recrue et programmatrice d'origine allemande, spécialiste des nouveaux courant musicaux.
Roland, programmateur français (dont le berceau était probablement trop près des enceintes), propose une heure par semaine de Rock Progressif.
Véronique, la douce voix féminine et aussi la ""Madame Money"" de l'organisation.
Mike ""Voice Actor"" la célèbre et inimitable voix masculine de Poptastic Radio.

et moi-même, Claude, fondateur et programmateur principal. 




Une nouvelle façon de promouvoir les nouveaux talents

Notre force est également de donner du temps d'antenne aux artistes émergents en évitant de les mettre dans une case à part. Notre particularité, à laquelle nous sommes très attachés et de mixer ces nouveaux artistes avec d'autres artistes Pop mondialement reconnus, voire légendaires. Nous croyons que le fait d'enchainer un nouvel artiste avec une icône de la Pop music donne beaucoup plus de crédibilité aux nouveaux talents.


 Aujourd'hui, nous avons besoin de vous pour continuer

Depuis le début, Poptastic Radio est diffusée sur une plateforme de streaming gratuite fournissant catalogue de musique et couvrant les frais de redevances, en échange d'espaces publicitaires. Parfait pour démarrer un projet, mais insuffisant envisager un développement futur.En outre, aujourd'hui cette société connaît de sérieux problèmes administratifs, financiers et juridiques. Récemment, suite à ces ennuis, les ressources mises à disposition ont été réduites. A l'heure actuelle, la diffusion est encore assurée mais restreinte dans plusieurs pays.Voilà pourquoi l'existence même de la radio est maintenant incertain.

 De quoi avons-nous besoin pour continuer ?

Notre démarche vise à collecter des fonds pour couvrir les frais de migration (streaming et acquisition d'une librairie musicale) ainsi que les frais de fonctionnement pour une année (hébergement, achat de nouveaux titres, droits d'auteurs, communication). La publicité, actuellement imposée par le prestataire actuel (sur laquelle nous ne bénéficions d'aucun reversement) sera remplacée par la vente en interne d'espaces publicitaires limités à 2 x 2 mn par heure, dont les revenus vont progressivement se substituer aux fonds collectés sur IndieGogo, jusqu'à garantir l'autofinancement de la radio, dès l'année suivante. Le reste des revenus provenant de merchandising et des cotisations des membres actifs de la radio.
Notre but est de collecter USD 15,400 (environ 13,600 €). Plus précisément, notre projet à ce jour est basé sur trois axes importants.Les contributions seront utilisées selon ces différentes façons :

Streaming audio et droits d'auteur Récolter des fonds pour intégrer une nouvelle structure de diffusion en streaming sur une plateforme payante connue et reconnue pour la qualité de ses services, son dynamisme et sa réactivité. C'est la base même de notre fonctionnement. Comme tout autre radio, Poptastic Radio a besoin d'une diffusion sans interruption et d'une excellente qualité du son.
Montant : USD 3,600 (environ 3200 €)


Musique (discothèque)Notre programmation est, à ce jour, constituée à 90% de titres provenant de la librairie musicale mis à notre disposition par la plateforme dont nous souhaitons nous séparer. Nous sommes donc dans l'obligation de reconstituer ce catalogue en achetant l'ensemble des titres qui le composent et de l'enrichir régulièrement de nouveaux titres. Comme nous tenons à respecter le principe du droit d'auteur, il n'est pas question pour nous de procéder à des téléchargements illégaux. Par conséquent, cela représente un investissement important car notre programmation est actuellement composée d'environ 3000 titres.
Montant : USD 5,800 (environ 5100 €)


Communication
La réussite et la pérennité d'une entreprise comme celle-ci passe par la
communication et une visibilité permanente. Vos efforts et nos efforts ne seront récompensés que par une audience fidèle et grandissante, que nous n'obtiendrons pas si nous faisons l'impasse sur la communication. C'est une erreur fréquente que nous constatons dans d'autres projets similaires. Nous voulons l'éviter. La visibilité de Poptastic Radio, comme tout autre entreprise, passe par la communication traditionnelle : flyers, affiches, partenariats et bien évidemment et en priorité la publicité en ligne. C'est aussi pour cela que nous avons besoins de fonds.
Montant : USD 6,000 (environ 5300 €)

Earlier this year, I decided I had to make sacrifices in order to pursue my dreams. I have been writing and playing music since I was 12 and my goal is to become an audio engineer.

<p>It's been a rough few years since I've been out of school. I have a beautiful wife who has stayed with me through thick and thin and she always stood behind anything I've tried to do. I have an incredible three year old son, who has ultimately been my biggest inspiration in this. I want nothing more than to make my family happy. I'm tired of living check to check. I'm tired of driving myself to a job I'm not happy with at 4 in the morning and working too hard for too little, only to daydream of a better life. I want what's best for me and my family.</p>

<p><strong>Femme</strong> <strong>Rebellion</strong> ist ein D.I.Y. Musikfestival, das Musiker_innen und Musikinteressierten jeglichen Geschlechts einen open space zur Verfügung stellen möchte, um mit den bisher immer noch geltenden sexistischen Rollenverteilungen in der Musikszene zu brechen.</p>
<p>Anfang der 1990er Jahren starteten eine Menge Frauen- und gemischtgeschlechtliche Bands ausgehend von der Riot Grrrl Bewegung in den USA eine Art Rebellion, um die herrschenden sexistischen Selbstverständlichkeiten in Musikzusammenhängen zu überwinden. Leider konnten heute über 20 Jahre später immer noch keine Bahn brechenden Veränderungen in dieser Hinsicht erreicht werden. Mit dem Femme Rebellion Festival wollen wir daher versuchen, an diesem Zustand etwas zu ändern indem wir das vielversprechende Feuer, das damals entzündet wurde wieder entfachen.</p>
<p>Der Name des Festivals ist inspiriert durch das Neska Rock („Mädels Rock“), einem kleinen baskischen Festival, 100% D.I.Y., dessen Ziel es ist aufzuzeigen, dass Musiker_innen kein bestimmtes Geschlecht haben müssen, und durch die Femme Rebellion Tour, bei der die beiden gemischtgeschlechtlichen spanischen Bands Milenrama und Penadas por la Ley, durch Spanien ziehen, um andere gemischte Bands mit ihrer Idee anzustecken und so einen sexismusfreien Raum im Musikkontext entstehen zu lassen. Mit dem Femme Rebellion Festival am 21. Oktober in Berlin (Tommyhaus) und am 22. Oktober in Hamburg (Centro Sociale) wollen wir diesen Spirit aufgreifen und auch in Deutschland verbreiten. Dafür haben wir die beiden spanischen Bands, die in ihren Land bereits für Unruhe sorgen, und ein paar Bands aus der BRD eingeladen.</p>
<p>Gerade in der Punkszene, wo schon seit langem über Sexismus diskutiert wird, ist es in der Praxis immer noch nicht selbstverständlich, dass Gleichberechtigung wirklich praktiziert wird. Daher wollen wir zusammen mit allen, die sich von unserem Anliegen angesprochen fühlen, beginnen einen Raum in Musikzusammenhängen zu erkämpfen, in dem es eines Tages keine Hierarchien und keinen Sexismus mehr gibt.</p>
<p><strong>100% D.I.Y. , frei von Sexismus, Rassismus und Geldgier.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fühlt euch eingeladen und macht mit! Unterstützt unser Vorhaben, kommt zu den Konzerten, und helft uns dabei eine schönere Welt zu erschaffen!</strong></p>
<p>Mit Eurer Hilfe werden wir die Anreise für die Bands bezahlen können sowie die Technik, Verpflegung, Werbung etc.</p>
<p>Es gibt viele Wege, wie Ihr uns unterstützen könnt. Ihr könnt eines unserer wunderschönen T-Shirts kaufen, eine Eintrittskarte für ein unvergessliches Konzert oder einfach so Geld spenden.

<h3>CYN</h3>
<p>For those of you who do not know me, my name is Cynthia Gillet whose musical alter ego is CYN. I am a French EMD/art rock artist, guitarist, bassist, vocalist, performer and composer. </p>
<p>Having first made a name for myself in Europe with musicians Guy Pratt (of Pink Floyd &amp; Killing Joke), Rodrique Janois (of the hugely successful musical productions Mozart L'Opera Rock and Les Amants), and world-renowned guitarist and producer Chris Spedding, it is fair to say that I first gained notoriety as an original artist with my bands Sheena and Keny. </p>
<p>In 2012, I was invited to come to the U.S. to join American recording artist Rocky Hensel. Since being in America, I have played as both a guitarist and bassist with several world and regional touring acts including triple-platinum mega star Billy Ray Cyrus, metal band Venrez, hard rock band Domenica, and world music artists Adaawe.</p>
<p>Striking out once again on my own as CYN, I am now asking for your support to help me gain momentum as  solo electronica artist through my next release, which is entitled AWAKE.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What CYN Needs &amp; What <u>YOU</u> Get</h3>
<p>I'm turning to you -- my community of musical saints -- to assist in launching this effort and help me move my solo career to the next level. As I'm sure many of you already know, making and successfully promoting original music in today's musical landscape is still not an easy or inexpensive endeavor. </p>
<p><strong>The base goal of this campaign is designed to cover the following costs:</strong></p>
<p>Pre-production, Production, Recording, Mixing: $6800</p>
<p>Mastering: $1400</p>
<p>Artwork - Album Design: $500</p>
<p>CD Manufacturing: $1034</p>
<p>Credit Card and IndieGogo fees (combined 8%): $950</p>
<p>Indiegogo Perks: $1425</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While self-production is more feasible today for artists, the vast amount of music being produced makes it more difficult for even established artists to garner the kinds of audiences needed to sustain visibility. This is why I have also set extended ""blue sky"" goals to help cover the cost of video production and initial touring in 3 of America''s largest and most recognizable cities. </p>
<p><strong><u>So, if my base goal of $12,000 is met</u> and more funds are raised, the ""blue sky"" goal of $17,500 -- or an additional funding request of $5,500 -- will be used to cover the following expenses:</strong></p>
<p>Professional Video for the radio track: $3500</p>
<p>Tour support for travel to 2 shows (NYC) and 1 show San Francisco $2000</p>

Having first made a name for myself in Europe with musicians Guy Pratt (of Pink Floyd & Killing Joke), Rodrique Janois (of the hugely successful musical productions Mozart L'Opera Rock and Les Amants), and world-renowned guitarist and producer Chris Spedding, it is fair to say that I first gained notoriety as an original artist with my bands Sheena and Keny. 
In 2012, I was invited to come to the U.S. to join American recording artist Rocky Hensel. Since being in America, I have played as both a guitarist and bassist with several world and regional touring acts including triple-platinum mega star Billy Ray Cyrus, metal band Venrez, hard rock band Domenica, and world music artists Adaawe.
Striking out once again on my own as CYN, I am now asking for your support to help me gain momentum as  solo electronica artist through my next release, which is entitled AWAKE.

What CYN Needs & What YOU Get
I'm turning to you -- my community of musical saints -- to assist in launching this effort and help me move my solo career to the next level. As I'm sure many of you already know, making and successfully promoting original music in today's musical landscape is still not an easy or inexpensive endeavor. 
The base goal of this campaign is designed to cover the following costs:
Pre-production, Production, Recording, Mixing: $6800
Mastering: $1400
Artwork - Album Design: $500
CD Manufacturing: $1034
Credit Card and IndieGogo fees (combined 8%): $950
Indiegogo Perks: $1425
 
While self-production is more feasible today for artists, the vast amount of music being produced makes it more difficult for even established artists to garner the kinds of audiences needed to sustain visibility. This is why I have also set extended ""blue sky"" goals to help cover the cost of video production and initial touring in 3 of America''s largest and most recognizable cities. 
So, if my base goal of $12,000 is met and more funds are raised, the ""blue sky"" goal of $17,500 -- or an additional funding request of $5,500 -- will be used to cover the following expenses:
Professional Video for the radio track: $3500
Tour support for travel to 2 shows (NYC) and 1 show San Francisco $2000

</h3>
<p>It all started back at Northern Arizona University in February 2015. Within two weeks of meeting and forming, we were actively playing and booking shows in Flagstaff, AZ and the Phoenix metro area. Six months later, we were headed to Southern California on our first tour! The following school year brought almost more than one show per week, and enough local support for us to consider creating our first professional studio album. The money we had saved from all of our shows helped cover costs of recording and production with John Hererra at Clamsville Productions in Chandler, Arizona. While creating a physical album with hand-painted custom artwork by local Flagstaff artist Anartsy, we will also be distributing our music online. The album ""It's Alright"" will feature original 5 songs, including the single ""Fake"" available online August 3rd! Each purchase of the album also includes 2 free downloads ""Better Than Chocolate"" and ""Change Your Mind""! Our hope is to draw people into our music and leave them with a product that makes them want to dance, share it with their friends, listen to it in the car. Every little bit of support helps us reach our goal of sharing our music and merchandise with as many people as possible!</p>
<p>For those interested in pre-ordering the album for $5, you will also receive the 2 free songs before the album is even released! Other packages are available for purchase, and even those who aren't available to contribute can keep the campaign running by sharing with friends who love music! We are thankful for each person who supports our band in even the smallest of ways.  </p>

<p><strong>About Us-</strong>The Sleepless Elite:<br/>My husband Baylor Carter (Drums), and I, Carolina Kehoe (Electric Ukulele, Guitar, Lead Vocals) moved from Livingston, Montana, so I could attend the Berklee School of Music. While enrolled there, I was faced with the stark reality of meeting the foreseeable tuition requirements, or writing and performing the type of music I always longed to play. During this time I met Ben Deily of The Lemonheads, who urged me to begin composing my own music. Having never played guitar before, I plugged my ukulele into a Fender amp with the distortion on high and found something I liked. From that session The Sleepless Elite was born.</p>
<p><strong>“BEING COOL IS FREE” </strong>(but the recording of it isn’t)</p>
<p>Being Cool Is Free” is the 10 song LP follow-up to “Carolina’s War,” our debut EP produced earlier this year and currently in rotation. Since our first album was entirely self-funded and produced, we learned a thing or two about how to make the next album better. As a result of our debut album, a friend in California handed our two singles, “Friends” and “Games,” to his friend and co-worker, Matt Pavolaitis, a two-time Emmy® Awarded composer and mixer. Before I knew it we were invited to Los Angeles to record a song with Matt and his producing partner, Brett Cookingham. And now, with the help of their technical prowess, we can’t wait to record “Being Cool Is Free.”</p>
<p>Here are the singles from our first album:</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Where your Indiegogo funds are going.</p>
<p>(46%) Recording 10 songs: $7,000 (includes production, studio time, vocal tracking, mixing and mastering, and recording artist(s). This fee also includes the re-mixing/re- mastering of “Friends” and“Games” for radio-ready standards; and a final playback for all songs in a “big room” where feature film and television mixes are engineered.</p>
<p>(16%) Travel, food and accommodations from Livingston, Montana, to Los Angeles, and back again. $2,500</p>
<p>(29-34%) Manufacturing and marketing. $4,150-4,900</p>
<p>(4-9%) transaction fees. $600-1,350</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Please know we have already secured a reduced weekly rate for the studio; this is only guaranteed by our stringent work ethic and a promise to be “ready-to- go” when we walk in to record the album. We are acutely aware of studio and production charges, and how easily they can multiply. We are planning for a tight, five-day recording session with a one day buffer for surprises, if any. These fees are the bare minimum, any overages from the Indiegogo campaign will go toward enhanced manufacturing and marketing of the album, and perhaps a self-produced video of the singles. Of course, any amount we receive from people like you is greatly appreciated. This being our first campaign, we want to impress and earn the trust of those who extend their graciousness to us. We want to make every donor feel their hard-earned money is going to a cause from which they can be proud. In the end, if we can make new friends along the way, well, we’d like that too…</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>It is alright if you don't have the funds to help us. We still love you. But you can help by spreading the word on social media and with your friends.

<h1><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Who am I?</span></h1>
<p>My name is David Wall. I am the founder of <i>Good<strong>Road</strong>Network</i>, and music is my life.<br/>
<br/>
<span>As a young musician, I struggled with booking shows, breaking into new markets, and setting up tours.</span> </p>
<p><span>Eventually, I came up with a process for booking and touring that worked extremely well. Soon other musicians, bands, indie labels, and booking agents were inquiring about my process to learn how to book the venues I was getting.</span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Life on the road - a.k.a. learning the hard way!</span></h2>
<p><span>I’ve learned a lot while touring and found many things can go wrong.</span></p><p>Example … </p>
<p><span>On my first tour we borrowed a van and before we hit our first venue, some kid threw a rock through our window. This meant we couldn't leave anything in the van and had to unload everything every time we stopped.  I broke a tooth that same day and was in pain the entire trip.</span> </p>
<p><span>The first venue on this tour was over 1300 miles away. They overbooked us and mismanaged the amount of time each band got to play. We didn't hit the stage that night till the venue had closed.</span> </p>
<p><span>On our way home we hit a deer coming through the pass, nearly totalling the van we had borrowed. To make things almost comical, all of this happened during one of the worst forest fires in California history.  Our tour had us passing through some of the worst fire zones.</span>  </p>
<p><span>I never want anyone to go through that kind of experience when they tour.  From tour contracts, to mapping alternative routes. From reviewing venues to triple AAA insurance. These are the things GoodRoadNetwork aims to solve in order to alleviate the stress of life on the road.</span></p>

</div></div>","Who am I?
My name is David Wall. I am the founder of GoodRoadNetwork, and music is my life.

As a young musician, I struggled with booking shows, breaking into new markets, and setting up tours. 
Eventually, I came up with a process for booking and touring that worked extremely well. Soon other musicians, bands, indie labels, and booking agents were inquiring about my process to learn how to book the venues I was getting.
Life on the road - a.k.a. learning the hard way!
I’ve learned a lot while touring and found many things can go wrong.Example … 
On my first tour we borrowed a van and before we hit our first venue, some kid threw a rock through our window. This meant we couldn't leave anything in the van and had to unload everything every time we stopped.  I broke a tooth that same day and was in pain the entire trip. 
The first venue on this tour was over 1300 miles away. They overbooked us and mismanaged the amount of time each band got to play. We didn't hit the stage that night till the venue had closed. 
On our way home we hit a deer coming through the pass, nearly totalling the van we had borrowed. To make things almost comical, all of this happened during one of the worst forest fires in California history.  Our tour had us passing through some of the worst fire zones.  
I never want anyone to go through that kind of experience when they tour.  From tour contracts, to mapping alternative routes. From reviewing venues to triple AAA insurance. These are the things GoodRoadNetwork aims to solve in order to alleviate the stress of life on the road.

What IS GoodRoadNetwork?

GoodRoadNetwork (GRN) is a responsive, web-based, set of tools designed to help artists manage their careers.
GRN tools allow our members to build EPKs (Electronic Press Kit), book gigs, create tours, manage road schedules, promote events through multiple social networks, and much more!
GoodRoadNetwork eases planning, booking and playing gigs and tours by … 


Connecting people, artists, and venues


Updating (through email, SMS, and/or notifications) schedule changes, task completion, and booking updates


Tracking expenses, gigs and tours, and fans


Creating tours, itineraries, and rider agreements


Sharing music, images, videos, and road stories 






GoodRoadNetwork is a FREEMIUM service

We believe GRN’s core services should be made available to all musicians at any skill level. We will offer services that have subscription fees required, but it is important to us that all musicians be allowed access to our core set of tools. 


Take GoodRoadNetwork to the next level!

We have an amazing set of tools already available to our members. We just need a little help from you to take us to the next level.  Money raised through this campaign will contribute to next level features that will elevate GRN's tools above what exists in the market today.

<p> 1. En 2013 nous sommes partis 1 mois sur le chemin en reconnaissance afin de visiter beaucoup de maison à la vente, certaines avec beaucoup de travaux, très peu chères, environ 50.000€ et d'autres beaucoup plus correct, plus onéreuses bien évidemment, il ne sera pas difficile de trouver le lieu pour notre grand projet, nous sommes en contact avec des agences sur place qui attendent notre feu vert pour nous proposer des endroits adaptés à notre<a href=""#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by shoppi""> futur<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a> activité.</p>
<p>  2. le montant des travaux n'est pas très élevé à ce jour grâce à deux choses, la première est que nous avons restaurer entièrement notre maison actuelle, en ne conservant que les murs et le toit, j’étais dans le passé dans le BTP ce qui nous a bien aidé, la deuxième et pas des moindres nous avons aujourd'hui trois personnes de confiances qui ont eux mêmes restaurée leur maison qui se proposent gracieusement  leurs aide pour la réhabilitation de la futur albergue (maçonnerie cloisonnage,<a href=""#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by shoppi""> carrelage<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a> toiture...) <b> </b>c'est pour nous une énorme chance d'avoir nos amis qui nous suivent dans cette démarche, les 110.000€ que nous allons investir ne sont attribué qu'aux fournitures.</p>
<p>  3. les 40.000€ restant seront consacrés à l'aménagement, car il faut savoir que pour recevoir chaque jour 40 pèlerins, il faut un peu de matériel, salle de repas, dortoir,  aménager toutes les commodités: WC,  douches,  lieux pour le lavage des vêtements et séchages (avec lave linge et<a href=""#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by shoppi""> sèche linge<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a>) toujours pour  40 personnes et quotidiennement, les parties cuisines et toutes les vaisselles nécessaires.</p>
<p>IL est bien entendu que l'albergue ne se suffira pas ces 150.000 euros pour tout faire mais pour<a href=""#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by shoppi""> démarrer<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a> cette activité, c'est complètement faisable, si la somme dépasse nos espérances nous pourrons alors sans attente prévoir un grand jardin pour le repos des pèlerins avec des équipements pour se prélasser, nous pourrons acheter les animaux et prévoir le jardin bio qui alimentera la cuisine.                                                                                                                <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Si toutefois, nous ne parvenions pas à réunir la somme nécessaire à la création de cette<a href=""#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by shoppi""> auberge<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a> dans un premier temps, nous serions contraints de louer un lieux pour faire vivre ce projet ou de reprendre une albergue en tant qu'hospitalier dans l'attente de créer notre rêve, avec suffisamment de place pour les animaux, le jardin, les espaces extérieurs de repos.</span></p>

En 2012 nous avons eu la chance de parcourir tout le chemin vers Santiago depuis notre maison de six fours les plages, 66 jours de marche et 1700 kilomètres parcourus n'ont fait que renforcer un peu plus ce rêve de créer l’albergue parfaite pour nos amis pèlerins du monde entier. Chaque année nous repartons sur le chemin pendant nos congés, ce qui nous a permis d’être nous-même hébergés dans plus de 90 auberges en France comme en Espagne, et d’être hospitaliers à St Jean pied de port en 2015.        Nous retrouver sur le chemin est pour nous à chaque fois un moment magique que tout le monde devrait connaitre. Nous sommes à même aujourd'hui de connaitre réellement tous les besoins d'un pèlerin.



  Our story: Since 5 years, we're woking on this project: In 2012, we get the chance to walk through all the road to santiago from our house in Six-fours les plages (French Riviera): 66 days walking 1700 kilometers will strengthen a little more this dream of creating the perfect albergue for our friends pilgrims around the world. Every year, we go back on the road during our holidays, which allowed us to be ourselves hosted in over 90 hostels in France and Spain. Be on the road for us is a magical moment that everyone should know. We can really know all the needs of a pilgrim. 
 Desde hace 5 años que hemos estado trabajando en este proyecto, en 2012 tuvimos la oportunidad de viajar por todo el camino a Santiago de nuestros casa seis fours playas 66 días y caminar 1.700 kilometros viajó solo han fortalecido un poco de sueño crear el perfecto albergue para nuestros amigos peregrinos de todo el mundo. Cada año nos remontamos en la carretera durante nuestras vacaciones que nos permitió ser nosotros mismos organizamos más de 90 albergues de Francia y España. Encuéntrenos en el camino para nosotros cada vez que un momento mágico que todo el mundo debe saber. Estamos incluso ahora que sabemos realmente todas las necesidades de un peregrino.

              





         


Notre projet est de créer sur le camino Francès (Espagne) l'albergue idéale pour les marcheurs en route vers Compostelle, un havre de paix avec animaux et culture artisanale. Afin de mieux faire connaitre pour les contributeurs qui ne connaissent pas ce pèlerinage; la journée d'un marcheur consiste a marcher d'étape en étape, s'alimenter et se laver, se soigner et se reposer; nous allons proposer dans notre auberge aux gens de passage un lit et un repas chaud plus un petit déjeuner, dans un cadre de repos total. Comme chaque pèlerin en a bien conscience nous fonctionnons sur le partage, et créer pour nous cette albergue, ce n'est que rendre ce que l'on nous a donné pendant nos différends périples.Il est tout a fait important de vous expliquer que c'est pour nous un revirement complet dans notre vie, étant tout les deux salariés en France, nous allons prendre le risque bien calculé de partir pour cette nouvelle vie, l'albergue sera située en Espagne.
Our project is to create the ""camino Francès"" (Spain), the ideal albergue for walkers going to Santiago, a haven of peace with animals and artisan culture. In order to clarify the contributors who do not know this pilgrimage, the day of a walker is: walk step by step, feeding, bathing, care and rest. We propose in our hostel: a bed and a hot meal + a small lunch in a part of the most complete rest. Each pilgrim knows that we operate on sharing. For us, create this albergue its giving back what we received during our various travels. This change of life, a complete turnaround is very important to us. As any two employees in France, we will take the risk (well calculated) to go to this new life, the albergue will be located in Spain.
   Nuestro proyecto es crear en el Camino Frances (España) albergue ideal para los excursionistas en el camino a Compostela, un remanso de paz con los animales y la cultura artesanal. Para conocer mejor a los contribuyentes que no conocen esta peregrinación el día de un andador es caminar de etapa en etapa, la alimentación y el lavado, el cuidado y el descanso; vamos a ofrecer en nuestro albergue para pasar a la gente una cama y una comida caliente, más un pequeño almuerzo en un marco de total del resto. Como cada peregrino es consciente trabajamos en el intercambio y la creación para nosotros este this're albergue sólo de hacer lo que nos dieron durante nuestra varios périples.IL es muy importante que usted explicó que se trata de para nosotros un giro completo en nuestra vida, siendo tan solo los dos empleados en Francia, vamos a tener buen riesgo calculado a partir hacia una nueva vida, el albergue se encuentra en España.
                                                                                                    





Ce revirement dans notre vie est très important, afin de nous retrouver en contact avec la nature, le chemin et pouvoir rendre service aux gens de passage dans l albergue est fondamental pour notre équilibre, chaque pèlerins recevra le meilleur accueil qu'il se doit, pour les personnes souffrantes, Nous prévoyons quelques chambres isolées pour être tranquille et se remettre de l'étape qui aura été sûrement trop dure pour eux. Il faut bien savoir qu'une albergue reçoit des pèlerins du monde entier, réellement du monde entier, nous avons eu l'occasion de vivre des expériences inoubliables, comme cette fois a ""Bercianos del réal camino""ou nous étions 43 personnes à table pour le diner dont 18 nationalités différentes, seul le chemin vous font partager de tel moment.
This change in our lives is very important to find us in touch with nature, the way and be of service to travelers in the albergue is fundamental to our balance, each pilgrim will receive the best welcome he must for suffering, we expect some isolated room to be quiet and to recover from the stage that has been probably too hard for them. We must know that albergue receives pilgrims from around the world , actually the world , we had the opportunity to live unforgettable experiences, like this time a "" Bercianos del camino real "" or we were 43 people at the table to dinner with 18 different nationalities , only the way you make such a moment shared .
   Este cambio en nuestras vidas es muy importante para nosotros encontrar en contacto con la naturaleza, ruta y estar al servicio de visitar a las personas en el albergue es fundamental para nuestro equilibrio, cada peregrino recibirá la mejor bienvenida que debe por el sufrimiento, esperamos algo de espacio aislado para estar tranquilo y recuperarse de la etapa que ha sido probablemente demasiado difícil para ellos. Debemos saber que albergue recibe a peregrinos de todo el mundo, de hecho el mundo, hemos tenido la oportunidad de vivir experiencias inolvidables, esta vez como un ""camino Real del Bercianos"" o éramos 43 personas en la mesa de cena incluyendo 18 nacionalidades diferentes, sólo la manera de hacer un momento tan compartida.






                 







Chaque année entre 200.000 à 250.000 pèlerins arrivent à Santiago sur leurs pieds ou à vélo, et tout ces braves gens ont besoin tout au long de leur parcours de s'abriter chaque soir dans un lieu différend, c'est là que nous intervenons. Il existe beaucoup de refuges sur le chemin mais il est pas rare que tout soit complet. Pour rester dans les chiffres; l’hébergement pour un soir coûte entre 5 à 10€, le repas du pèlerin avoisine souvent les 8€ et les petits déjeuners 2.50€, pour notre auberge nous allons faire un dortoir de 40 lits plus trois chambres séparées pour les gens souffrants... Il est également bon de savoir en terme de chiffre qu'une albergue fonctionne environ neuf mois par an et qu'elle est ouverte chaque jour, ( et chaque jour c'est complet)  il n' est pas possible de penser fermer un jour, les pèlerins seraient à la porte et pas vraiment comprendre ce qui se passe...  Nous n'allons pas avoir cette activité pour nous enrichir, mais pour vivre, donner de notre temps aux autres et vivre en communion avec la nature et le chemin.  

 Each year between 200,000 to 250,000 marchers arrive in Santiago on their feet or bicycle, and everything is good people need throughout their travels to shelter each night in a different place , that's where we come in there are many of refuge on the way but it is not uncommon that everything is complete . To stay in the figures ; accommodation for one night costs between 5-10 € meal pilgrim often close to € 8 and € 2.50 a good breakfast to our hostel we do a 40 dorm beds plus three separate rooms for the suffering people ... it is also good to know in terms of a number albergue runs about nine months a year and is open every day ( and every day is full) it is not possible to think closed one day pilgrims would be at the door, not really understand what 's going on ... We will not have this activity to make us rich , but to live , give our time to others and to live in harmony with nature and path.        
    Cada año, entre 200.000 y 250.000 peregrinos llegan a Santiago de pie o en bicicleta, y todo es bueno que la gente necesita a lo largo de sus viajes al refugio cada noche en un lugar diferente, que es donde entramos nosotros Hay un montón de refugio en el camino, pero no es raro que todo está completo. Para permanecer en las cifras; alojamiento para una noche cuesta entre 5-10 € peregrino comida a menudo alrededor de 8 € y un buen desayuno € 2.50 a nuestro albergue hacemos unas 40 habitaciones de residencia durante tres camas separadas para las personas que sufren ... También es bueno saber que en términos de número albergue corre alrededor de nueve meses al año y está abierto todos los días (y cada día está lleno), no es posible que un día cerrado, los peregrinos estaría en la puerta, no realmente entender lo que está pasando ... No queremos que esta actividad para hacernos ricos, sino para vivir, dar nuestro tiempo a los demás y vivir en comunión con la naturaleza y la ruta.      

   


                 





 votreintervention dans ce grand projet est essentiel; sans votre aide il sera difficile de mettre en place ce grand chantier pour l'ouverture de l'albergue, nous allons devoir laisser notre emploi tous les deux pour nous investir complètement dans cette création, par conséquent aucune banque ne nous suivra pour financer les travaux et l’aménagement, c'est pourquoi nous faisons appel a votre générosité.  


Votre participation dans l’évolution de ce projet est essentiel, si nous voulons mener à bien cette création d albergue, nous sommes en mesure grâce à la vente de notre maison d'acheter le bien sur place avec le terrain; comme beaucoup de gens le savent, avec la crise économique qui a frappé l'Espagne  en 2008, les grandes maisons à la vente sont nombreuses ( il nous faut pour pouvoir accueillir tout le monde un minimum de 300m²) là ou intervient cette campagne et vos généreux dons sont pour les travaux de réhabilitation des lieux et l'aménagement.
                          
les fonds se découpent en trois grosses parties:


l'achat du bien       120.000 €
les travaux              110.000€
l'aménagement      40.000€


 1. En 2013 nous sommes partis 1 mois sur le chemin en reconnaissance afin de visiter beaucoup de maison à la vente, certaines avec beaucoup de travaux, très peu chères, environ 50.000€ et d'autres beaucoup plus correct, plus onéreuses bien évidemment, il ne sera pas difficile de trouver le lieu pour notre grand projet, nous sommes en contact avec des agences sur place qui attendent notre feu vert pour nous proposer des endroits adaptés à notre futur activité.
  2. le montant des travaux n'est pas très élevé à ce jour grâce à deux choses, la première est que nous avons restaurer entièrement notre maison actuelle, en ne conservant que les murs et le toit, j’étais dans le passé dans le BTP ce qui nous a bien aidé, la deuxième et pas des moindres nous avons aujourd'hui trois personnes de confiances qui ont eux mêmes restaurée leur maison qui se proposent gracieusement  leurs aide pour la réhabilitation de la futur albergue (maçonnerie cloisonnage, carrelage toiture...)  c'est pour nous une énorme chance d'avoir nos amis qui nous suivent dans cette démarche, les 110.000€ que nous allons investir ne sont attribué qu'aux fournitures.
  3. les 40.000€ restant seront consacrés à l'aménagement, car il faut savoir que pour recevoir chaque jour 40 pèlerins, il faut un peu de matériel, salle de repas, dortoir,  aménager toutes les commodités: WC,  douches,  lieux pour le lavage des vêtements et séchages (avec lave linge et sèche linge) toujours pour  40 personnes et quotidiennement, les parties cuisines et toutes les vaisselles nécessaires.
IL est bien entendu que l'albergue ne se suffira pas ces 150.000 euros pour tout faire mais pour démarrer cette activité, c'est complètement faisable, si la somme dépasse nos espérances nous pourrons alors sans attente prévoir un grand jardin pour le repos des pèlerins avec des équipements pour se prélasser, nous pourrons acheter les animaux et prévoir le jardin bio qui alimentera la cuisine.                                                                                                                Si toutefois, nous ne parvenions pas à réunir la somme nécessaire à la création de cette auberge dans un premier temps, nous serions contraints de louer un lieux pour faire vivre ce projet ou de reprendre une albergue en tant qu'hospitalier dans l'attente de créer notre rêve, avec suffisamment de place pour les animaux, le jardin, les espaces extérieurs de repos.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Started in 2001, Tears Run Black was a metal band from the panhandle of Florida.  Active for three years, life caused a split up of the band geographically.  June 6th of 2011, we lost our drummer and our close friend Robby McDonald.  We decided to record this album as a tribute to Robby.  We love him dearly and miss him every day.  This is for him. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking for around $3,000 to cover the cost of physical production of the CDs, t-shirts, stickers, and recording and production of the album itself.  We've already written the music, we are fine tuning now, and will be entering the studio at the end of October with Joseph Milligan (Anberlin) in Austin, TX.</p>
<p>We've got many different options for you to choose from to support this project.  Feel free to choose what works best for you.</p>

<h2>Voodoo Radio</h2>
<p>Voodoo Radio is the title of the forthcoming and first full-length album of Longshot Voodoo:</p>
<h3><strong>Who Are We?</strong></h3>
<p>In 2011, formed Adrienne West, Carl Eddy, and Matt West (performing as the West-Eddy Trio) joined with percussionist Don “DC"" Culp, Motif Magazine’s “2010 Percussionist of the Year” and 2013 Rhode Island Music Hall of Fame inductee to form Longshot Voodoo. To compliment the Trio’s unique style, Culp designed the Dun Dun Percussion set, the first known of its kind, which is a drum kit made entirely out of African Hand drums. Melding the essence of ‘60s and‘70s classic rock, blues, and New Orleans R&amp;B, Longshot Voodoo has carved a reputation of entertaining audiences with their infectious rhythms and jams.</p>
<p>In 2013, Longshot Voodoo released their first EP, ""Zen Cave Mojo"" and played a spotlight set at the Unity Concerts garnering rave reviews and front page coverage on the Providence Journal Bulletin. In 2014, the band headlined for a standing room only crowd at the Courthouse Center for the Arts in the ""Halloween Recovery Concert"". Longshot Voodoo was nominated for the Motif Music Awards 2015 Best Americana Act. In 2016, Longshot Voodoo was the opening act at the 19th Annual Rhythm &amp; Roots Festival, with Adrienne was nominated for Best Female Vocalist in the 2017 Motif Music Awards. </p>
<h3><strong>Voodoo Radio: The Album</strong></h3>
<p>Over the majority of the past two years, Longshot Voodoo has been creating in their magical headquarters and recording studio ""The Zen Cave"" writing, producing and recording their first full-length album, entitled Voodoo Radio. The ten-track release is schedule to drop July 2018. A pseudo-concept album, Voodoo Radio will tell stories and proudly represent the influences that have helped Longshot Voodoo's ongoing evolution.</p>
<h3><strong>Why We Need Your Help</strong></h3>
<p>As a part of the release of Voodoo Radio, we still have some financial hurdles that we will need to clear to give the best possible listening experience to our fans, While we are fortunate enough to be able to complete most of the recording process in our Zen Cave, the engineering, mixing, and mastering will be completed with the assistance and guidance of a world-class engineer, whose identity we've been asked to keep under wraps until the completion of the process. We also have commissioned the legendary Providence, RI musician &amp; artist Mark Taber to create the artwork that will be featured on the album cover. Two of the tracks on Voodoo Radio will require some additional rights clearance as Longshot Voodoo will be releasing our cover of a hit single by The Cars and a classic Led Zeppelin tune, both in our Voodoo-ized style.  Your help allows us to make all of these aspects of the album occur in a timeline that meets our anticipated July 2018 release.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We've set ourselves a bit of a lofty goal of raising $2500 over the next 60 days. This money will help pay for the mixing &amp; mastering process, digital release/streaming rights, artwork, and physical release of the album. Additional funds raised will be directly applied to the planning and production of the Voodoo Radio CD Release Concert, which supporters will be able to receive tickets for as a perk.</p>
<p>The perks we are offering include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An autographed copy of Voodoo Radio to be sent before any other copies are made available to the public, accompanied by a personalized letter of thanks from the members of Longshot Voodoo.</li>
<li>A limited edition 8x10 print of the Voodoo Radio art work suitable for framing, numbered and signed by the regarded Providence Found Object Artist  (and RI Music Hall of Fame inductee) Mark Taber.</li>
<li>VIP Tickets to the Voodoo Radio CD Release Concert.</li>
<li>A framed and personalized CD  plaque celebrating the supporter's help in the release of Voodoo Radio.</li>
<li>A special credit in the liner notes of Voodoo Radio, forever linking the supporter with the release of Longshot Voodoo's first full-length album.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The album release not only marks the completion of a recording process over the past two years that has been peppered with personal and technical challenges through the process, but also represents the next evolution of Longshot Voodoo in sound and song-writing.</p>
<ul>
<li>This will be the first album completely recorded in DC Culp's Zen Cave Studios using an 8 track digital recorder and some studio magic.</li>
<li>Longshot Voodoo previously recorded and produced their 2013 EP Zen Cave Mojo featuring Michael ""Tunes"" Antunes of John Cafferty &amp; Beaver Brown fame on saxophone in the early days of Zen Cave Studios.</li>
<li>The studio has since upgraded the recording hardware, including new industry-standard microphones and a more versatile multi-track digital recorder.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We're very much getting to the end of the actual recording process of Voodoo Radio. To get the ten tracks into finalized mixes and the mastered for release, we'll need to raise the appropriate funds to complete those tasks with the oversight of the aforementioned expert.</p>
<p>We also will need to secure the streaming and digital release rights for the sings written by Ric Ocasek and Jimmy Page/Robert Plant before we can release the tracks.</p>
<p>Finally, we'll submit the music and artwork for physical and digital release through a number of commercial platforms.</p>
<p>The main challenge we face is raising the capital to complete these tasks. We're committed to our July 2018 release and believe in the music that we're releasing. Longshot Voodoo as a band, is so excited for people to hear the music we've been creating and will be driven to make this release a reality.</p>
<p>Through our friends' and fans' support,  our campaign success can be possible. Please be a part of the magic behind Voodoo Radio!</p>
<h3> Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Every little bit counts. While you might be unable to contribute in a way that earns a ""perk"", please do not think that help of ANY LEVEL isn't completely appreciated and helpful in this campaign.</p>
<p>Also remember that there are additional non-monetary ways that you can support our campaign.</p>

<li>Spread the word to your friends and family through social media</li>

The main challenge we face is raising the capital to complete these tasks. We're committed to our July 2018 release and believe in the music that we're releasing. Longshot Voodoo as a band, is so excited for people to hear the music we've been creating and will be driven to make this release a reality.
Through our friends' and fans' support,  our campaign success can be possible. Please be a part of the magic behind Voodoo Radio!

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>I am Cuban-Canadian composer, performer and teacher, and I find that all three define me as an artist.  In 2015 I created the <i>Art Song Collaborative Project</i> as a means to combine the three main aspects of my artistic vision while also giving composers an opportunity to present their music in Canada. Through the project I have successfully organized, funded, and performed two concerts in Toronto in the past two years.</p>
<p>Currently, 15 composers are collaborating on <i>Coming Home</i>, a new modern opera through art song, premiering in Toronto on July 14, 2018.</p>
<p>With your help, our project can continue to evolve and include collaborations by not only musicians but artists of all disciplines.</p>
<p>We are striving to create a new work each year that reflects the issues assailing our world, and through our art offer a glimpse at possible solutions. <strong>                                             </strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>*London friends we will be having a performance on July 15th in Von Kuster Hall at UWO. </p>

<p> </p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>We need your help to support all the artists involved in our International Opera. Iranian composer Homa Samiei, German composer Peter Michael von der Nahmer and our two American performers will be joining us for a week of rehearsals and the two performances. </p>
<p>Part of the cost includes helping our artists come for the rehearsals and performance, as well as to honour their time and hard work over these past few months. </p>
<p>We have amazing perks for you, from video and audio links of last year's performance to advanced ticket sales for Coming Home this year. </p>
<p>Every little bit will help us support our artists and allow us to expand into our dream and vision of a multidisciplinary arts collaboration. </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>This year, <i>Coming Home - an International Opera Through Art Song</i> is exploring the meaning of Home while addressing the issues of the immigrant/ migrant and refugee crisis. The Opera will follow the story of a widow and her young daughter as they tread unknown paths in a search for new beginnings. </p>
<p>Each composer has contributed one art song in their own unique style exploring the doubts, difficulties, hopes, dreams and fears of the mother and daughter as they search for a new home. The variety of the pieces offers a glimpse at the possibilities of 21st century music. </p>
<p>You can see examples of our first year's project: Music Drama ""Glimpses"" on our website: artsongcp.com, or purchase a link to the audio and/or video of last year's ""In Wonderland.""</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<p> </p>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Now in its third year, the Art Song Collaborative Project has grown to include 15 composers and 6 performers from Canada and around the world. We want to support each of our artists for their time as well as to continue expanding our vision.</p>
<p>So far we have not been successful securing government grants and sponsorships, mainly due to the lack of support material from previous years. Nonetheless each year I have been able to fund the project myself.</p>
<p>This year we want to guarantee an amazing performance and be able to obtain excellent quality documentation to add to our portfolio. We also want to expand our followers and push our project further both locally and internationally. </p>

<h3>So, where are we now?</h3>
<p>The music for the album is recorded and the documentary is filmed.  Actually, some of the songs on the album were included in independent films over the past few years and toured the world.  The documentary itself enjoyed a couple of festival appearances and even won an award for Best Short Documentary at the Bare Bones International Film &amp; Music Festival!  Making a professional album isn't cheap.  Making an award-winning documentary isn't cheap.  We've taken it all as far as we can.  What we need now is to actually produce the album, along with the documentary, in a rare single-package release. <br/> </p>
<h3>How can you help and what can you get?</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Here's a break down in more detail:</p>

The music for the album is recorded and the documentary is filmed.  Actually, some of the songs on the album were included in independent films over the past few years and toured the world.  The documentary itself enjoyed a couple of festival appearances and even won an award for Best Short Documentary at the Bare Bones International Film & Music Festival!  Making a professional album isn't cheap.  Making an award-winning documentary isn't cheap.  We've taken it all as far as we can.  What we need now is to actually produce the album, along with the documentary, in a rare single-package release.

<h3>A brief history of Mermaids... </h3>
<p>""Mermaids on the Verandah,"" is the second full length album from Los Angeles based Psychedelic/Rock band Send Medicine. Clocking in a little under 45 minutes, the album contains 9 original songs, 8 of which are unreleased, and also includes the single ""She Believes in the Devil,"" which was released as a single in 2017. </p>
<p>The band has been sitting on this album for a little over a year and after bouncing around different releasing strategies, and various label support, we've decided to finally put it out on July 27 via the mom and pop label; ""Honey House"" based in San Francisco. </p>
<p>The album was recorded back in December of 2016 at Stationhouse in Echo Park Los Angeles, under the wizardry of Mark Rains and was mixed in the following months by then bassist; Aaron Stern and lead singer/guitarist Julian Hacquebard. </p>
<p>The album's personnel includes: Julian Hacquebard; Guitar/VOX, Ryan Patrick Glennan; Theremin, Keys, Percussion, Harmonica, VOX, Lauren Grimaldi; Percussion, Aaron Stern; Bass, Keys, Piano, Curran McDowell; Drums, Percussion, Davey Donaldson; Guitar, Piano, Pyper Wyn Davies; VOX. </p>
<p>We're extremely proud of this collection of songs. As a whole, we see them as an exciting new step forward into the band's sonic pilgrimage. There's something for everyone on this record and we are very excited to share it with YOU! </p>

<h3>Why we need your help...</h3>
<p>As you're probably aware, being a musician in 2018 poses a lot of challenges. The triangulation of ""music purchasing"" being supplanted under a sea of streaming services, while also trying to get your music heard and discovered in the labyrinth of available media, are both extremely trying on bands.</p>
<p>As a result of this, we've decided to attempt to raise some funds to kick into several marketing strategies for the album, as well as a radio campaign, in the hopes of letting the album cast a wider net on the ears of new listeners, hopefully spawning new opportunities that allow the band to keep creating more music. </p>
<p>In September of 2018 we'll also be hitting the road for a national tour to further promote the album, and are trying to reel in some very minimal touring expenses!</p>

<h3>Perks for Donating!!</h3>
<p>We have collected a bunch of incentives for those of you willing to support our vision and help uplift this record! These include the album itself; in both Digital, CD and Vinyl formats! T Shirts, original artwork, a book of handwritten lyrics and more intimate perks as well!</p>

<p><strong>A Little Background Info:</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Kuhl is Cas Greenfield and Mikey Cooling.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘The Circus of Outrageous’ was recorded at Kuhl’s work-in-progress Grammofonica studios in the Severn Plains, close to the fine City of Gloucester. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The final selection of twelve tracks were then skilfully mastered by Pete Maher.</p>
<p>And now ‘Circus’ is ready to take on the world! </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Kuhl Ways You Can Help.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our goal is to raise £9250 to complete the projects we have started with Kuhl. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have created ‘Circus’ on a budget of nothing. The studio and production costs have been pared back as far as we could, but now, we need to consolidate the work we have invested in our projects and the extra outlay and costs are unavoidable. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Kuhl’s Projects.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are currently rehearsing a touring band so that we can take ‘Circus’ on the road and around the festivals in 2018. This is one area we need key funding badly - covering rehearsal rooms, promotional material, running the office while attempting to draw in the kind of promoters who can put us in front of our public. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Plus, since beginning work on ‘Circus’ we have been compiling footage to create an hour long documentary movie about the evolution of Kuhl, culminating in a definitive live gig filmed before an invited audience. We will be adding more details about this exciting development shortly and your pledge toward this project will guarantee you a producer’s credit!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are grateful for your input at any level, whether you’d simply like a Kuhl MP3 Download, a signed Limited Edition Digipak CD or an exclusive framed print of the album artwork. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>YOU are the fuel that will keep the Kuhl engine turning!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Are We Real?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Oh yes! We live, we breathe, we create…</p>
<p>We’re bringing deep and intense composition coupled with a dose of mad humour often missing in electronic music today. There are real people behind the creation that is Kuhl’s multicoloured Circus. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The artwork and the lyrics flow from Cas Greenfield’s imagination and meld with staggering synchronicity with Mikey’s quirky way with a tune. ‘Kashablankha!’ had us both rolling on the floor of the studio in hysterics! ‘Uber’ is just crazy! But ‘Head Rush’ and ‘Don’t Look Down’ brought us to tears…</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1513069861/boeqf0h34qqdyck23jbe.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How Did We Get From There To Here?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Circus was born out of frustration - Mikey and I are both creatives and when introduced to a studio and recording company that seemed excited about the writing and production team we are, we thought we would blossom, but lack of business acumen, bad decision making and general shortsightedness on the part of the company owners simply stifled any creativity that should have flourished… So, Kuhl grew out of that. We felt like errant school kids at the end of a long hard day - we threw ourselves unfettered into the joy of music making.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Master Plan. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>There was no ‘Master Plan’ at first, until…</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cas: ‘One night we suddenly had ‘Uber’ in the can. A spontaneous and joyous outpouring that led the way forward. Another night and ’Zsa Zsa’ took centre stage.  One long small hours session and there was ‘Don’t Look Down’ and somewhere along the way ‘Civilisation’ became a reality.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And we ended up with twelve tracks that we are constantly surprised by, thrilled, with and still wondering when and how they came into being.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The artwork too became part of this serendipitous experiment. Leaving paintings out in the rain just to see what the elements and the beasts of the field would do to the pastels. Glorious decomposition!’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mikey: ‘We had not planned to build this stripy Big Top of an album - but here it is now, we just can’t stop the carnival! Ringmaster, acrobats, freaks, beasts, jugglers and clowns waiting in the wings and ready to roll!’</p>
<div> </div>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Music Maestro, Please!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>With tracks that draw in everything from human rights to female impersonators, from the first kiss to the last breath, from film noir to Shakespeare, from the state of the heart to the state of the world, Kuhl’s ‘Circus’ is an intelligent combination of hard and soft beats with thought provoking lyrics. </p>
<p><br/>Pink Floyd and Depeche Mode meet the Pet Shop Boys and Prince? You may not be far off!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But judge for yourself. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Love, Peace and a Global mindset!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Circus’ has a truly international feel, with tracks in English, Dutch, German, Italian and Kuhlspeak.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Space Cake’ features a gentle and nostalgic rap in Dutch, while ‘You, Me, The Stars &amp; Love’ speaks its words of love in Italian.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Kuhl finds their inspiration in the disco of the 1970s and 80s, with the beats of today’s stadium noise permeating the groove. Euro bands such as Army of Lovers, Gravitonas, PSB creep through the undergrowth of sound, with Skrillex, Knife Party and the like informing the cutting edge production. </p>

Hello folks! Thank you so much for joining me. I am a drummer, singer-songwriter, guitarist, and pianist from Asbury Park, NJ. I am extremely excited to share this MASSIVE feat and labor of love of an album with you. The album is called ""When It Happens To You.""  The title comes from a poem written almost two years ago.
 
It was recorded at Cedar Sounds in Oceanport, NJ. Engineered by Tim Pannella and Joey Henderson.  Produced, written and arranged by Rachel Ana Dobken. 
I am beyond lucky to have such a phenomenal cast of musicians on this: 

Rachel Ana Dobken (drums, guitar, voice, piano)
Dan Haase (bass)
Ryan MacLean (guitar)
Joey Henderson (guitar, voice)
Chris Dubrow (bass)
Andrew Jackle (drums)
Mark Masefield (B3 hammond)

Danny Clinch (harmonica)
Ian Gray (trombone)
Bruce Krywinsky (trumpet)
Dennis Daly (sax)
Gabe Sanderson (keys)

Currently being mixed by: Kyle Joseph
It is a HUGE task to create an album. From concept to completion, it can take months, even years.  From arrangements, to rehearsals, shows, to sleep (lack-thereof), and all the crazy decisions in between (Guitar tones! Why does my voice not work like it's supposed to today! Who am I and why am I here anymore!), it takes a lot of time, energy, and MONEY... yes all of that.

WHAT WE NEED
--
While I have funded as much as I can out of my own pocket, I am still in need of your gracious support! Everything you donate will go toward to the following expenses (and then some):

Tracking
Mixing
Mastering
Paying musicians
Physical CD distribution
Online digital distribution (Spotify, Itunes/Apple Music, etc... )
CONTENT: Video + Photography costs
Marketing/PR/Exposure​In 2018, putting out a great record means NOTHING unless you have the proper exposure behind it.  This campaign is not only serving the album financially, but by having you share our Indiegogo (whether you donate or not), it allows us to gain a whole new level of exposure and expand our fanbase that we wouldn't otherwise get.


 
* So, even if you can't donate, PLEASE share our Campaign in hopes of getting Rachel Ana Dobken & Band the exposure they deserve!

<p>I've been ambitious.  At age 22 I started crisscrossing the country, writing behind the wheel (figuratively), and performing any chance I could.  I played hundreds of shows (solo and with the band), gained a following, self-published four albums, and made a lot of friends along the way...and I burned out.  I left a good deal of professional momentum behind in 2009 to travel around the globe studying intentional communities and to find a more meaningful way of engaging with music, the medium that calls me.  Music was the language we all spoke and I met people making a positive impact in their communities through the arts.</p>
<p>In 2011, I returned to co-launch (with Deb Bicknell) a project, in partnership with Seeds Of Peace, that brought together musicians and artists from countries in conflict to make music together in Portland.  I believe music is a force for good in this world.  Throughout my career, I've been able to support many organizations, communities, and causes that are doing important and impactful work.  I also believe that music is essential to our being and connects us to our deepest humanity</p>
<p><i><strong>                                      When music is made, a community is made.  </strong></i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>I invite you to be part of a special community this for one night.</strong></i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">I’ve spent much of the past six years as a teaching artist in Portland Public Schools (like the <a href=""http://www.tellingroom.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Telling Room</a>, <a href=""http://www.maineacademyofmodernmusic.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Maine Academy of Modern Music</a>, and<a href=""http://www.317main.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> 317 Community Music Center)</a> and, primarily, holding onto the threads of my creative identity as I became a mother. <i>I'm ready to stake my claim as a songwriter again, affirm my role as an artist, and release these songs that have been born of the last decade</i>.  I can't do this without a new body of work and video to work with. And I'm really ready to have some fun doing it!</p>

</div></div>","October 18th, 2018!    121 Cassidy Point Dr. Portland, ME 04102  (parking on site)
6:30pm - Community Dinner    7:30pm - Concert and Recording
****PLEASE NOTE: Options for the dinner perk has now closed*****

I've been ambitious.  At age 22 I started crisscrossing the country, writing behind the wheel (figuratively), and performing any chance I could.  I played hundreds of shows (solo and with the band), gained a following, self-published four albums, and made a lot of friends along the way...and I burned out.  I left a good deal of professional momentum behind in 2009 to travel around the globe studying intentional communities and to find a more meaningful way of engaging with music, the medium that calls me.  Music was the language we all spoke and I met people making a positive impact in their communities through the arts.
In 2011, I returned to co-launch (with Deb Bicknell) a project, in partnership with Seeds Of Peace, that brought together musicians and artists from countries in conflict to make music together in Portland.  I believe music is a force for good in this world.  Throughout my career, I've been able to support many organizations, communities, and causes that are doing important and impactful work.  I also believe that music is essential to our being and connects us to our deepest humanity
                                      When music is made, a community is made.  
I invite you to be part of a special community this for one night.
I’ve spent much of the past six years as a teaching artist in Portland Public Schools (like the Telling Room, Maine Academy of Modern Music, and 317 Community Music Center) and, primarily, holding onto the threads of my creative identity as I became a mother. I'm ready to stake my claim as a songwriter again, affirm my role as an artist, and release these songs that have been born of the last decade.  I can't do this without a new body of work and video to work with. And I'm really ready to have some fun doing it!


I'm most excited to be performing with long-time bandmates: Adam Frederick (bass), Seth Kearns (drums), Max Cantlin (guitar) with the incredible addition of friends (and forces to be reckoned with): Kate Bever (vibes/percussion) and Sorcha Cribben-Merrill (guitar/voice).  There will be some special guests too!

 

                                                       

                                                                    ""The Wee Hours"" Live at OLS

The Songs:
Fear, Love & Hope rise to the surface with these songs as themes.  As in much of my work, the natural world provides the foil, origin, and mirror to these emotions and provides a deep source of inspiration.
Prepare yourself for a rich tapestry of sound that grooves and will likely make your head nod and hips move.

<h3>Who is Bric-a-Brac?</h3>
<p>Many moons ago, John Connors and Mike Armstrong met and quickly discovered their mutual love of obscure records and songs, many of which they discovered on records purchased at thrift stores. Active in the local music scene at the time, John and Mike thought it would be fun to form a band and play these songs live, so that others might also enjoy what they found so compelling. <i>Bric-a-Brac</i> was formed and had their first gig at the legendary Chicago club <i>Lounge Ax</i>. 20 years on, the band is still going strong and ready to release a brand new record filled with 11 weird and wonderful tunes. Songs with sounds and styles ranging from jumpy numbers about odd romantic attractions to tragic sea ballads.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How you can help &amp; what you will get</h3>
<p>The album is ""in the can"" - recorded, mixed &amp; mastered. To get it released, we we need money for the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Because these songs are not our own (culled from thrift store records) we need to secure licensing to release them to the public. Half of the money raised will go to initial licensing costs.</li>
<li>We will press as many CDs as we can, the aim is to do 200 initially, and add more as needed.</li>
<li>The rest of the money will go to distribution, shipping &amp; promotional costs.</li>
<li>All backers will get a copy of the record as a Digital Download, CD, or both - depending on what level they choose.</li>
<li>Higher-level backers will get a super de-luxe<i> </i>package in the mail with CD, Digital Download Card, and one piece of high-quality<i> ""bric-a-brac""</i> to add to their collection.</li>
<li>Bric-a-Brac t-shirts will also be available at certain levels.</li>
<li>If we do not reach our goal, the funds we raise will go toward licensing. If and when we are able to raise the rest, we will release the record.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>How your help makes an impact</h3>
<p>There is a vast quantity of great songs out there that nobody will ever hear. Some of these songs will be forever trapped in obscurity, bound to the third track on the second side of an oddball record, or on the b-side of a 78 rpm single:</p>
<ul>
<li>We believe these songs deserve to be heard, shared, enjoyed and preserved for future generations. This is no small task!</li>
<li>We have rescued many songs from obscurity, some of which made it onto our two previous albums <a href=""http://bricabrac.us/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>16 Luxury Units</i></a>, and <i><a href=""http://bricabrac.us/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Three Weeks from Yesterday</a> (our tribute to Rod McKuen).</i> We play the rest at our live shows and with your help, we can add these 11 gems to the catalog!</li>
<li>Besides our regular internet streams, some of these songs have even made it onto <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfn2usX67mI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TV</a> and radio - (""What's My Name"" played on <i><a href=""https://www.thisamericanlife.org/197/before-it-had-a-name"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">This American Life</a>)</i>. With your help, just imagine where else we can get these songs played and heard by others!</li>
<li>We empathize with the songwriters who put their sweat and soul into these songs. We try to do right by them and play homage to them the best way we can.</li>
</ul>
</div><div><p>This project is incredibly important to us, and we love these songs as if they were our very own. If we don't get this record out, these songs run the risk of remaining in obscurity forever.</p></div><div>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>""Rahu The Fool"" is a musical band, </strong>performing songs inspired by grandfathers' stories of love and war, of the vast seas and countryside meadows, as well as other things long forgotten — life in the old times and the bright moments of the present affairs.</p>
<p>In terms of music, the ensemble tries not to stick upon a certain cliché. Yet for the customs and to label things fair, their music can be classified as traditional jazz, with sparkles of jug-band, folk, bluegrass and world music.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why double the trouble? </h3>
</div><div>
<p>The first CD by the name of ""RAHU"" will include various Latvian ditties, folk and sailor songs, as well as compositions from Rolands Kalniņ'š movie classic ""Four White Shirts"" (Četri Balti Krekli, 1967). The second CD named ""THE FOOL"" will feature traditional jazz, Mississippi Blues, and Western Folk music. Each CD will contain 14 tracks, including original compositions, covers and different folk music arrangements.</p>
<p><strong>Along with dope tracks from the present and past</strong>, the album will include an original inside book with authentic photos from our grandfathers and grandmothers, along with our own photographs shot on vintage 1890' Burke &amp; James photo camera!</p>
<p><strong>The aim of the album is to revive the cultural and historical heritage of Latvia from the early 20th century </strong>— closely resembling the so-called popular (ditty, schlager) and work songs. Album's repertoire covers various themes of Latvian life, from love affairs and pubs to philosophical theses and political issues. These songs are often carried out in a satirical, theatrical format.</p>
<p><strong>This album also aims to highlight folk music traditions from other nations and countries</strong>, created around the 20th century and even older times. Among these pieces are Estonian, Ukrainian and Belorussian dances, the blues of the Mississippi region, as well as one of the oldest songs included in the album — the original melody of a 15th-century sailor song. This album was inspired by Brāļi Laivinieki, Edgars Liepiņš, Imants Kalniņš, Blind Boy Fuller and Memphis Jug band. <br/><br/>Guest artists in this album are the lead singer from blues-rock band The Coco'nuts - Marija Broča, and professional skateboarder Madars Apse, performing compositions from Mississippi John Hurt.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why we need your support?</h3>
<p>We've been paying from our own pockets for most of the necessities for the album presentation concert and two songs mixed and mastered already. Unfortunately, the creation of an album doesn't end there and we still are in need of:</p>

<li>Album promotion activities - 200.00, </li>
<li>Sound equipment rental for the album presentation concert - 450.00.</li>

<p>Hello! We are the Peeces. We were sent here to help with the new, coming age of enlightenment, and ONE.</p>
<p>I am Jerry Douglas, and it is now, 2018, in Los Angeles, CA. This is my story…. A story of leading a band called The Peeces.</p>
<p>I started with music from a very young age, leading my Grandma’s gospel church choir into song, at 3 years old.  I suppose my first memory of rocking out may have been performing in the mirror with a Prince album,  that my Aunt put on. I also remember my mom going crazy watching Michael Jackson perform, you could say she was a fan!</p>
<p>From then, I started to fall more in love with music as I performed solos with the honor choir, in Elementary, and with the show choir, in high school.  The Beach Boys’ “Barbara Ann” was a tricky falsetto to nail, considering the voice changes that took place around my sophomore year. Our choir director helped me through, though, as he did with everything from madrigals to Cole Porter jazz.</p>
<p>Once I could afford a band rehearsal space, I started putting together bands and I haven’t stopped since.</p>
<p>Taught myself to play and sing by playing along with Nirvana’s “Nevermind” album, and the radio, in my hometown of Sacramento, CA.  The love of that album lead to me starting a band called The Heylos. The first song I ever sang with my own rock band was Radiohead’s “Creep.”</p>
<p>When it came time to move the band down to Los Angeles, and into the industry, I was the only one who took the plunge. Once I got here, I formed a band called The Persuns, and we got a band rehearsal space located between the Echoplex and Satellite, on the Echo Park/Silverlake border. </p>
<p>The Persuns was a Beatles and Nirvana cover band and we played everywhere in Los Angeles from burlesque and strip clubs, to arts festivals and New Year’s Eve house parties.</p>
<p>After that, I experimented with being a vocalist for a 60s/70s rock cover band called Suns Of Jimi. Here I sharpened my vocal abilities through impersonating Jimi, Jim Morrison, Bob Marley, James Brown, and Robert Plant.  Also had my first experience of singing three hours of music all by myself. The stamina requirement was real!</p>
<p>And now, The Peeces. The Peeces were formed in the future and sent here to help roll out the  great enlightenment of humanity, about to take place. The mission is to arm the people with the special key to the universe known as One. Through a unity of all people, we will progress to Utopia. The Peeces were sent on a mission to help make that happen.</p>
<p>Be a part of the great enlightenment, and helping humanity unite as One. Follow us on our journey through the stars, and through our gigs, on Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, or by being a part of our email list. You are helping humanity evolve by doing this. Thank you. You are making this mission easier, by being a part of it.</p>
<p>Be One.</p>
<p>A Producer from Universal Records wants to record our song ""Baby,"" at CBS Studios!  Just like the pros have to pay for an engineer and editing, so do we. $$$</p>
<p>Me and the guys have been playing music all of our lives, for an opportunity to record with a proper LA producer.</p>
<p>These guys have gotten new artist deals before, so anything you can do will be amazing, and totally help save the world. </p>

The Persuns was a Beatles and Nirvana cover band and we played everywhere in Los Angeles from burlesque and strip clubs, to arts festivals and New Year’s Eve house parties.
After that, I experimented with being a vocalist for a 60s/70s rock cover band called Suns Of Jimi. Here I sharpened my vocal abilities through impersonating Jimi, Jim Morrison, Bob Marley, James Brown, and Robert Plant.  Also had my first experience of singing three hours of music all by myself. The stamina requirement was real!
And now, The Peeces. The Peeces were formed in the future and sent here to help roll out the  great enlightenment of humanity, about to take place. The mission is to arm the people with the special key to the universe known as One. Through a unity of all people, we will progress to Utopia. The Peeces were sent on a mission to help make that happen.
Be a part of the great enlightenment, and helping humanity unite as One. Follow us on our journey through the stars, and through our gigs, on Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, or by being a part of our email list. You are helping humanity evolve by doing this. Thank you. You are making this mission easier, by being a part of it.
Be One.
A Producer from Universal Records wants to record our song ""Baby,"" at CBS Studios!  Just like the pros have to pay for an engineer and editing, so do we. $$$
Me and the guys have been playing music all of our lives, for an opportunity to record with a proper LA producer.
These guys have gotten new artist deals before, so anything you can do will be amazing, and totally help save the world.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

They immediately hit it off and began dreaming of stories to tell together. Thus was born one of the (soon to be) greatest musical comedy collaborations of all time, that of Sarah Naughton and Jake Weinstein.Jake and Sarah's first creation together was a cabaret all about the wonderful world of audiobook narration entitled ""Trapped In The Closet."" Described by critics as a ""gem"" and a ""wildly theatrical piece,"" they played two sold out shows at Feinstein's/54 Below in 2017. Consequently, ""Trapped in the Closet"" was featured in 2018 as the pilot episode of the new musical theatre podcast, ""The Micro-Musical Theatre Show.""Currently Jake and Sarah are taking their creative pursuits to the next level! They have made their partnership social media official (cute!) by becoming Jake & Sarah Present. Now they're working on two musical shorts: one in post-production, ""Mythical Creatures,"" and one in pre-production, ""Get Out (Of My Head)."" They're also writing an ALL NEW satirical cabaret about the first daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner, entitled, ""Javanka: Back In New York,"" which will premiere at Feinstein's/54 Below on February 15th, 2019. FUNdraisingWith so many different projects in the works, we're finding we need help covering the costs!

<p>My name is Jan Seides, and I’ve been a singer/songwriter as far back as I can remember. I’ve been playing piano since I was 3 years old, guitar since I was a teenager, and I can’t ever recall not singing. I have a degree in music, an extensive catalog of songs, five completed and published recordings. And I’m working on the sixth. That’s the one I want to tell you about, because I feel like all the previous albums were leading me to this one. And no previous album has meant this much to me. Here's why....</p>
<p>Bible stories are a part of our Western culture in a way that almost nothing else is, except perhaps the plays of Shakespeare. Their origins and meaning are the target of much speculation, but even 3-year-olds can tell you at least one or two, usually Noah's Ark or Adam and Eve. But the stories we have come to know, and the characters who populate them started as an oral tradition, and when they were written down, the writers decided who was important and who was incidental. And I found the ones left out very intriguing.</p>
<p>Here’s how it started: I wrote a song called “Sarah Laughed” about how when Sarah was told by the angel that she would have a baby at 100+ years old, she laughed at the absurdity. One night, after I performed it, a woman approached me on stage and recommended a book called Women in the Bible. So I read it. For the first time, I noticed how many seemingly important people (to the story, if nothing else) we never learn anything about. My somewhat inflated sense of responsibility kicked in and I decided my job was to tell those stories in song, because, after all, each of us is important – at least, to ourselves and those who care about us. Some of the songs are of women and some of men, some Old Testament and some New, some angry, some sad, some sexy, some joyful, some were even funny. (Yes. I found humor in the Bible. Who knew?)</p>
<p>I got to play these songs all over Israel in 2016, one of the highlights of my life. Bringing the stories back to their birthplace was immensely gratifying.</p>
<p>The songs are recorded (by Bradley Kopp) and mastered (by Airshow Mastering), and I was about to get into the manufacturing phase, when someone suggested that I turn the project into a book, I enlisted my friend, Vanessa Lively, a talented graphic artist and watercolorist to help me illustrate the songs, and there are line drawings by … ahem … me. It all looks spectacular. I can’t wait for you to see!</p>
<p>But I need angels to facilitate this birth, and so I’m turning to you. Your contribution will make this book happen, and you can take credit for seeing it safely into the world.</p>
<p>By the way, the clues to the answers for the contest in the video? They're in the perks, as far as which people are candidates. But the pictures in the perks may or may not be attached to the correct names. I did want you to see how lovely the illustrations are though.</p>
<p>Here's what making the book will cost:</p>
<p>$1,140 Original art, graphic art, layout</p>
<p>$2,684 Printing</p>
<p>$1,000   Manufacture of CD</p>
<p>$1,500   Mailling and publicity</p>
<p>$6,324 Total</p>
<p>If I don’t reach the whole goal, I will use what I do receive for the printing and the manufacture of the CD. The project will still happen, it will just take a bit longer.</p>

<p><strong>My music story</strong></p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I’m Julie Kay Jensen.  I’m a singer/songwriter originally from Iowa (United States) but I have been living in Europe for the past 20 years.  I settled in the French countryside near Geneva, Switzerland where I enjoy a beautiful view of clear lakes and Alpine mountains. </p>
<p>Music has been rooted in my soul from a very young age.  I entertained myself for hours dressing up and pretending I was Blondie in front of our sliding glass windows.  I dabbled in music throughout my youth but was a more passive participant in my adult years.  However, I have always enthusiastically attended concerts and shared a deep love and appreciation for the way music could bring large groups of people together in a beautiful, rhythmic union.</p>
<p>One year ago, in February 2019,  after over 20 years of keeping the music inside myself, I decided to take a leap of faith and reached out to find other musicians.  A local band invited me into their family and my musical spirit was unleashed.  Singing publicly after 20 years of silence was raw and vulnerable, messy and transforming. It has been amazing to share music from my heart and soul with a wider audience.  In the late spring, I was introduced to a wonderful musician, producer, and human being, Greg Arnold.  He challenged me to write my own music and I discovered a hidden songwriter who had been laying dormant for far too long. It tore open a vault of music that was ready to rush out in high volumes.  Suddenly, melodies and lyrics were flowing out of me faster than I could get them down on paper.  We began shaping them into full songs and worked with Toby May at Unagi Sound Studio in Geneva, Switzerland to start recording.  It has been beautiful and wild and I can’t wait to share the music with all of you.</p>
<p>To those of you who don’t know me, I hope you get an insight through the video and updates that we will be adding from time to time as we progress through this process. </p>
<p>I am eager to release a full length studio album.  The music industry has changed and musicians are using crowd funding initiatives to financially back their albums.  The fun part is involving the biggest supporters which are the fans and the audience.  You will get to step backstage to watch the album come to life and I will do my part to update the process regularly. </p>
<p>I am hugely excited to share this experience with all of you and I hope you will enjoy walking alongside me as the project transforms into a fully formed album made for you and me.  Greg Arnold is producing the album and I feel very privileged to work with such talented people. </p>
<p><strong>Co-writer</strong></p>
<p>""I am super excited to be working on Julie's album as a producer and co-writer.  She is a very natural talent - she sings with an ease that I envy and also, she is a very clear and strong melody writer.  I also love the spirit behind her work - it's very positive, but still nuanced.  The story of her return to music is really charming and I am really glad if I can help out.  I am really looking forward to writing and recording more songs with Julie.""</p>

<h2><strong>Welcome!</strong></h2>
<p>Hi! Thanks for exploring my campaign. For those of you who don't know me, my name is Erinn Alissa Selkis, and I am a singer/songwriter based in Los Angeles, originally from Upstate NY. I have written more than 100 songs in the last couple years, performed many of them with my band all over Los Angeles, and have chosen my favorites to record professionally and create my first EP and official music video.  Having broadcast quality songs and videos will allow me to share my songs with the world on all platforms, and have music to pitch for use in film, tv, and commercials, officially launching my career as an indie artist! Oh, and I'm also 37 years old. Here I am, with you as my witness, reclaiming my dream of having a singing career, well into my mid 30's. </p>
<h2><strong>Truth</strong></h2>
<p>It feels very vulnerable to announce my age like this, because it's something I try to hide. I don't look my age (finally there's a pay off to having a baby face), so people assume I'm younger than I am and I let them.  Not because I don't want to be 37; I love my 30's actually, and as my dad says, it sure beats the alternative! But in an industry where 16 year old you tube stars are born, and someone's young age is a badge of honor, 37 is kinda old. Your mid to late 30's are when you are supposed to be at the height of your career, not just realizing and starting your dream... so I have a lot of insecurity around it. And it's cool to be a twenty something waitress paying the bills while funding your music career, but not so much in your thirties. There are more expectations, risks, and much more at stake. But there's a bigger risk in living an unfulfilling and purposeless life if I don't take this chance, and I know in my heart of hearts that this is my path. So the risk is worth it. I'll admit that sometimes I wish I could go back in time 15 years and realize this path of mine then...but obviously I can't. And I'm learning to be ok with that. My journey was my journey for a reason, and I wouldn't be who I am without it. Also, I like to remind myself of people who were well into their 40's or even 60's before they found success, like Samuel Jackson, Julia Child, and Alan Rickman. </p>
<h2><strong>The Struggle</strong></h2>
<p>So what was my journey? What do I mean by reclaiming? To try and keep it short and to the point, I was a musical theatre girl on the path to Broadway. I studied and performed voice, dance, and acting intensively from a young age and continued in college, receiving my BFA in musical theatre. </p>
<p>Here's a video of baby Erinn from my college days playing my favorite role ever, Maggie in A Chorus Line. I later played her professionally many times.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/UFT-aMJzQmI?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div style=""text-align: center;""> </div>
<div>After college, I performed at Equity regional theatres, did a couple national tours, and had lead roles in Summer stock shows. I was technically doing exactly what I had always envisioned, but I had a secret. I was battling an eating disorder, and I was miserable. I didn't like myself, and my self esteem was non existent, except when I was cast in a show- I made my worth entirely dependent upon whether or not casting directors liked me. The musical theatre and dance world was harsh, and while I was considered ""normal"" by most standards, I was never as thin as anyone wanted me to be- I was told daily that if I wanted to be cast, I needed to lose weight. The death of my mom when I was in college also wrecked me... I had lost my anchor, and without it, I was floating around, trying to be who these casting directors wanted me to be, because I felt like performing was all I had left. After years of eating iceburg lettuce with mustard and tunafish (the meal I concocted to trick my stomach into feeling full and get a little protein in but the least amount of carbs), and running on the treadmill for hours on end, on top of training and performing, my body started to fall apart. And my mental and emotional state was already in shambles. Simply put, I was an absolute disaster. </div>
<div> </div>
<h2><strong>Coming Back Home</strong></h2>
<p>So I quit it all. I left the only dreams I had known behind and decided I would do something else with my life, and get myself help. It took me many years of exploration, grieving the death of my mom, therapy (highly recommend it!!), spiritual growth, etc, to heal myself and discover this new path of writing and singing my own songs. A discovery that I am incredibly grateful for today. Along the way, I learned that I wasn't any happier without music, but I was definitely happier without the pressure of trying to be something I wasn't. I now have the freedom to be exactly who I am, express myself through my songs, share my heart and soul, and connect to my listeners in a way that wasn't possible with musical theatre. I hope my music moves people, helps them put words to feelings, gets them through a breakup or hard time, inspires and motivates them, and just simply makes them smile or feel less alone. </p>
<p>The beautiful thing is that before I found musical theatre, I was a 7 year old with a microphone, a Yamaha keyboard, and journals of lyrics, inspired by my idol Debbie Gibson (go ahead and laugh but she was awesome) :) So, my journey brought me back home. It just took a few decades lol. But this time, I am holding onto it and running with it. </p>
<p>Speaking of ""Home,"" this is a clip of the 2nd, just released single off of the EP. Enjoy this cheesy video I made :)</p>

<h2><strong>Where I am Now</strong></h2>
<p>I've been working hard to establish myself in the music world: Out of all the songs I've written, I've chosen the ones that will make up the EP, and I've already recorded 3 of them with my amazingly talented producer, Max Allyn. The first single, ""Just Another,"" was released last summer, and has over 13,000 listens on Spotify and has been played on three online radio stations.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/BIEuK8VJV9I?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div style=""text-align: center;""> </div>
<p>My band formed and we've played at many venues in LA, I've been hired to sing the National Anthem for festivals, as well as performing sets at lots of restaurants, wineries, and parties. I've been a finalist in The American Songwriting competition, and have had songs placed in independent films. I even got a song in the hands of Katy Perry's team, and though she didn't end up recording it, the feedback was that they loved it! My main goals with this EP are to have professional recordings of my songs to share with my fans (and gain traction as an indie artist), and to get my songs licensed for TV, film, and commercials. There isn't a lot I can do without having broadcast quality songs. </p>
<h2><strong>Why I'm asking for your help!</strong></h2>
<p>It's hard to express how much your contribution would mean to me. </p>
<p>Forging this new path takes a lot of courage, and I can't do it alone. Claiming this career at this point in my life is vulnerable, my music is vulnerable, being on stage and having people listen to the words I write from my heart is vulnerable, and asking for your support is vulnerable! But I'm doing it because it is also the most fulfilling thing I have ever done. Over the last year, I've had the support of my incredible band, my professional music friends, and my close friends, which has made all the difference to me. Now I'm taking the next step with recording this EP and promoting it. But making an EP isn't cheap! It’s quite expensive to record, produce, mix, and master songs. Not to mention the promotions, music video, pitching, photos, and PR needed after release to get my songs heard and in the hands of people who love my music and people who do music sync. I'm reaching out to you for help because the process is going sooooo slooooowly due to financials, and since I've already told you how long it took me to get here, I don't want to waste another second :)</p>
<p>You and I will be a team in creating my EP, and ultimately my music career. I'll be keeping you posted every step of the way. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
</div><div>
<p>We need to raise $7,000 to complete my EP and promote my music!</p>
<p>- Each track (3 more to complete EP) is $1500 for studio time, recording, production, mixing, and mastering. I have 3 tracks already completed, so it will be a 6 track EP. </p>
<p>-$1500 to finish paying for a very low budget (but very legit) music video to promote and draw in listeners. I've already filmed (it's looking amazing!!!) and spent over $2000, but I still need to finish it and promote it.</p>
<p>-$1000 for photos, distribution costs, guest musician pay, and other promotional materials.</p>
<p>These are very conservative estimates, so I'm hoping we will even surpass our goal!</p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal, all of your contributions will still count and will go towards as many songs as I am able to finish, so it will still be very effective. </p>
<h3>Now what you get!!</h3>
<p>First, you get to support a fellow human on her journey to living her dream. I will be so incredibly grateful for any amount of support you give me. Second, there are many very cool perks I am offering! A free download of my already finished songs Just Another and Home (every backer, no matter how much they donate, gets this), a download of the rest of  the songs before they are officially released, a completed copy of the EP (in your preferred form of listening), playing music for your party, event, etc, custom written songs for you, requested covers, and more. If you have an idea of a perk you'd like, but I don't have listed, please feel free to ask me about it!</p>
<p>Know that with your support, you will be contributing not only to my growth, but also to creating a beautiful collection of songs that I hope will touch the listener and make him/her feel connected. As Billy Joel once said, ""I think music in itself is healing. It's an explosive expression of humanity. It's something we are all touched by. No matter what culture we're from, everyone loves music.""</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, there are other ways you can help.</p>
<p>You can post on social media to get the word out and make some noise about this campaign. Or perhaps you know someone who would appreciate helping out a musician and you can share this with them. </p>
<p>Thank you so much for your support! Sending you much love and gratitude. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!</p>
</div></div>","Welcome!
Hi! Thanks for exploring my campaign. For those of you who don't know me, my name is Erinn Alissa Selkis, and I am a singer/songwriter based in Los Angeles, originally from Upstate NY. I have written more than 100 songs in the last couple years, performed many of them with my band all over Los Angeles, and have chosen my favorites to record professionally and create my first EP and official music video.  Having broadcast quality songs and videos will allow me to share my songs with the world on all platforms, and have music to pitch for use in film, tv, and commercials, officially launching my career as an indie artist! Oh, and I'm also 37 years old. Here I am, with you as my witness, reclaiming my dream of having a singing career, well into my mid 30's. 
Truth
It feels very vulnerable to announce my age like this, because it's something I try to hide. I don't look my age (finally there's a pay off to having a baby face), so people assume I'm younger than I am and I let them.  Not because I don't want to be 37; I love my 30's actually, and as my dad says, it sure beats the alternative! But in an industry where 16 year old you tube stars are born, and someone's young age is a badge of honor, 37 is kinda old. Your mid to late 30's are when you are supposed to be at the height of your career, not just realizing and starting your dream... so I have a lot of insecurity around it. And it's cool to be a twenty something waitress paying the bills while funding your music career, but not so much in your thirties. There are more expectations, risks, and much more at stake. But there's a bigger risk in living an unfulfilling and purposeless life if I don't take this chance, and I know in my heart of hearts that this is my path. So the risk is worth it. I'll admit that sometimes I wish I could go back in time 15 years and realize this path of mine then...but obviously I can't. And I'm learning to be ok with that. My journey was my journey for a reason, and I wouldn't be who I am without it. Also, I like to remind myself of people who were well into their 40's or even 60's before they found success, like Samuel Jackson, Julia Child, and Alan Rickman. 
The Struggle
So what was my journey? What do I mean by reclaiming? To try and keep it short and to the point, I was a musical theatre girl on the path to Broadway. I studied and performed voice, dance, and acting intensively from a young age and continued in college, receiving my BFA in musical theatre.

<h3>Here's the Nitty-Gritty</h3>
<p>After years of writing music on the side I've decided, with support from so many of you, that I will be doing a studio album to release some of these tracks. Here's what's exciting and why you might want to get involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>After being on stage and in studio for 15 years I have not put out any of my own music in a professional capacity. This will be the first professionally recorded and released music written primarily by me.</li>
<li>I will be collaborating with many of my musician friends that I have NOT been able to work with in the past. At current count I have 6 collaborators outside the core group I originally planned to be involved. I'll be releasing videos with them as we're able to work on the album.</li>
<li>When recording an album, typically a band will pool resources and funding to get that album paid for. As this is going to be my project, and I don't make a ton of money in my day job, your contributions will increase the number of songs I can record for this project.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here's a breakdown on what I plan to do with the money:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'll be recording with Russell Hollar (of In Search Of Sight || Russell Hollar Music / Nomad Recording Studio) to record these tracks. The per song rate is $350, including recording, mixing, and mastering. </li>
<li>I have hired Gershom Wetzel (author/illustrator of 'Teres') for the album art. He has agreed to a deferred payment contract once the album is complete.</li>
<li>Contributors will receive a CD in sleeve with original artwork, signed by yours truly. If the excess funds allow I will also order some stickers to be given first to you for your donations.</li>
<li>For every $350 we will have a song completely paid for. Additional funds beyond that will give us a chance to buy CDs, stickers, T-Shirts, and posters for your donations. Any excess money will be donated to a local music project like this. I will hold a private poll for you, the contributors, and the highest votes will determine what project we are funding.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I have been a musician for most of my life. It has been a blessing to do what I love and share the music in my heart with people all of these years. I have never had the opportunity to be the primary writing force in a band that released music professionally and publicly. This has been something I've wanted to do for the last few years, but I haven't been able to secure the funding due to the cost of living. There's always been something more important to invest money into. Not only will this be an incredible opportunity for me to grow as a musician, but also an opportunity for y'all to hear what's been rattling around in my head.</p>
<p>I want to state with no reservations that I absolutely love and adore Further North, and the music that we make. While we don't have specific genre restrictions, I do have another side of my writing style that doesn't get to see much of the light of day. This is our chance to get that put on the record (pun intended) and released for all of you to enjoy.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>You know, when evaluating risks I don't see many, if any. While this won't be something I can do overnight, this will eventually be made. With or without the funding I will make this record happen. Your contributions only speed up the timeframe to get started, and help to increase the number of songs we can include on the album. <br/><br/>Challenges we will face are not even very difficult. We do have some collaborators from out of the area, and across Texas, but they have access to proper studios and will be sending their tracks in to Russell to mix. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>This is not a cry for money. This is not a pity party. This is an opportunity for us to share in the excitement of new music, and a bigger project. You do not have to send a dollar to be involved. Anything you can donate is greatly appreciated, but you can also help by sharing the campaign with family and friends, people that support local music, and might want to financially support the project. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to read this, and thank you for supporting me and my dreams. I am beyond excited to be able to do this for y'all. It has been a dream of mine, and it's finally here. I love you all. </p>

We have already successfully completed our first season, with significant personal investment. This is an idea we are deeply committed to. The wheels are in motion and the acts are booked for season 2 and 3. If we don't reach our entire goal, we will still produce the series, albeit with a shortfall.</p><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p><p>Your support will bring together new communities and create a place where people can go, regardless of economic background, to experience high vibes and the best of the best in soul music. While these funds will be specifically directed to the fall season, they will demonstrate your support and commitment for the overall initiative. You are our audience and if you dig the series, we are well on our way to future seasons of Propeller. </p><p><strong>Experience</strong></p><p>The series is produced by Golden Future Recordings, owned and operated by Jeanette Wilkinson and myself and we are familiar with managing projects such as this.</p><p>Several years ago I produced and managed local music series, Wachu. We featured more than 20 local acts over 2 years and together with Jeanette Wilkinson, we produced a video series profiling the challenges and excitement in the local scene. The series grew into a documentary in search of how to survive and navigate the challenges of the ever-shifting landscape of the independent music scene (The answer? Well, there isn't just one, but a series like this plays a significant role).</p><p>I have also supported many charitable community projects over the years including environmental engagement projects, and community initiatives with Callanish Society, St. Paul's hospital, and many others.</p><p> Together with Jeanette, I produced my last album entirely in Vancouver, featuring 2 studios, 3 producers, 27 musicians and a supporting full-length dance video. We love creative challenges, no matter the size, and always see them through.</p><p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><p>Our biggest challenge for Propeller is building an economically sustainable series. </p><p>With our first season we started to build a small loyal following but we need to reach more people...lots more! </p><p>We don't have a big marketing budget. This is a guerilla-style operation -- social media advertising, postering, pitches at local events, word-of-mouth, and hand billing the crap out of the city. If you are still reading, YOU are our audience. So whether or not you fund our campaign, you can help build this night through one of the many ways suggested below.</p><p>We would like to keep the night at Guilt &amp; Co and so the best way to increase our capacity while maintaining the PWYC price is to get more bodies on the dance floor. To do this, we need the place lined up before every show, enabling us to remove some tables and chairs, increase our capacity and break even on a consistent basis.</p><p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p><p>We understand that not everyone is able to fund, but there are other ways to support Propeller:</p><p>Come to a show! Tell people about it! Tell everyone you know about it! Write about it in your blog, talk about it on your podcast, whisper it in the ear of your lover, sing it to your grandma over hot chocolate and solitaire. </p></div>","world-class talent

We want to extend our community through Propeller and we offer this invitation to anyone who wants to join us and come down in the name of great music, good vibes and soul.  What We Need We need $6,000 to cover the costs associated with running season 2 of Propeller, including fees, travel and accommodation for guests artists, marketing, and photography, What we are asking for is a temporary band-aid while we search for long-term solutions to support a series that takes place in an intimate venue while still providing a pay-what-you-can price.     We're passionate about making this series not only happen, but grow. We have already successfully completed our first season, with significant personal investment. This is an idea we are deeply committed to. The wheels are in motion and the acts are booked for season 2 and 3. If we don't reach our entire goal, we will still produce the series, albeit with a shortfall.The ImpactYour support will bring together new communities and create a place where people can go, regardless of economic background, to experience high vibes and the best of the best in soul music. While these funds will be specifically directed to the fall season, they will demonstrate your support and commitment for the overall initiative. You are our audience and if you dig the series, we are well on our way to future seasons of Propeller. ExperienceThe series is produced by Golden Future Recordings, owned and operated by Jeanette Wilkinson and myself and we are familiar with managing projects such as this.Several years ago I produced and managed local music series, Wachu. We featured more than 20 local acts over 2 years and together with Jeanette Wilkinson, we produced a video series profiling the challenges and excitement in the local scene. The series grew into a documentary in search of how to survive and navigate the challenges of the ever-shifting landscape of the independent music scene (The answer? Well, there isn't just one, but a series like this plays a significant role).I have also supported many charitable community projects over the years including environmental engagement projects, and community initiatives with Callanish Society, St. Paul's hospital, and many others. Together with Jeanette, I produced my last album entirely in Vancouver, featuring 2 studios, 3 producers, 27 musicians and a supporting full-length dance video. We love creative challenges, no matter the size, and always see them through.Risks & ChallengesOur biggest challenge for Propeller is building an economically sustainable series. With our first season we started to build a small loyal following but we need to reach more people...lots more! We don't have a big marketing budget. This is a guerilla-style operation -- social media advertising, postering, pitches at local events, word-of-mouth, and hand billing the crap out of the city. If you are still reading, YOU are our audience. So whether or not you fund our campaign, you can help build this night through one of the many ways suggested below.We would like to keep the night at Guilt & Co and so the best way to increase our capacity while maintaining the PWYC price is to get more bodies on the dance floor. To do this, we need the place lined up before every show, enabling us to remove some tables and chairs, increase our capacity and break even on a consistent basis.Other Ways You Can HelpWe understand that not everyone is able to fund, but there are other ways to support Propeller:Come to a show! Tell people about it! Tell everyone you know about it! Write about it in your blog, talk about it on your podcast, whisper it in the ear of your lover, sing it to your grandma over hot chocolate and solitaire.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>My name is Adam Moezinia and I'm a Jazz guitarist/composer/educator/bandleader here in New York City. I'm originally from Los Angeles, where I studied at the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts (LACHSA) under the mentorship of Jason Goldman, Walter Smith III, and Kenny Dennis. About 9 years ago, in 2010, I  moved to New York City to study at The Juilliard School and since then, I've worked with many greats such as Freddy Cole, Mike LeDonne, Cecile Mclorin Salvant, George Coleman and Kenny Washington at venues like Jazz at Lincoln Center, The Blue Note, Birdland, Smoke, Scullers and Bird’s Basement. </p>
<p>In the 14 years or so that I've been studying/playing jazz I've been mainly focused on just that; learning the history of the genre and how to play it in an integral way. But during this journey, I realized that I had somewhat neglected my deep love and appreciation for other styles of music.. Other styles that got made me so passionate about music in the first place. I've always had a deep love for rock, blues, and folk singer/songwriters like Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell, and I realized that it was kind of silly to not incorporate those sounds into my own music.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I got deeper into composition and I realized that my compositional style just naturally had that influence in it. As I started digging deeper into other styles of music, I realized that what drew me to any piece of music was it's connection to folk music; a ""folk element"" if you will. That's how I got the name for the band. Everything that we play has a connection to some sort of folk music from somewhere around the world. On the album will be 2 songs from a suite that I wrote called the ""Ivory Suite"", inspired by the folk music of West Africa. There will also be 3 songs from some of Americas most influential folk artists; Bob Dylan, Robert Johnson and Duke Ellington as well as 2 more originals of mine that have a strong folk influence, and Welsh folk song.</p>
<p>After I started developing my own repertoire I started forming the band and playing shows around New York City. After workshopping the music with a handful of different musicians, I finally found the perfect band. This band features Charles Goold on drums and Dan Chmielinski on bass. With this configuration, we've been playing together for about year and a half now and have developed a deep chemistry that I think comes out in the music. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>My name is Briana Greer, and I am a songwriter, vocalist, musical worship leader, youth nonprofit director, wife, and mother based in Azusa, CA (LA area). </p>
<p>I started writing ""The End"" one evening in the summer of 2019 when I was feeling utterly lost, broken, and hopeless. As I sat on my couch and cried, God gave me the words to express what was going on in my heart: ""I'm at the end of myself."" As the words flew out of me, so did my prayer to God: ""Will you meet me in my brokenness? Are you enough to save me from the deepest pain I've known?"" I wrote most of the song that day, but there was something missing. A week or so later, I went a mom's group at my church, where one woman shared about the deep struggles she and her family had been facing with cancer. She, too, was at her end. As I drove home, God told me that the song was for her, and gave me the rest of the words to the song, as if I was writing the prayer that she needed for where she was at. </p>
<p>This project comes in response to the many emails, calls, texts, and in-person conversations of people requesting the song after also being touched by hearing it.  It's been made clear to me that people need a way to express the deep suffering they encounter in various walks of their journey of life, and that God wants to use ""The End"" as a tool to meet people in that suffering and draw them close to him.</p>
<p>My goal of $2600 will cover the cost of the highly professional recording and production needed to distribute ""The End"" to not only those who have already heard it, but to the many who haven't who God wants to touch through this song. It will also cover fees and the 5% reserve that Indiegogo applies to every fundraising campaign.</p>
<p>I invite you to join me in investing in the Kingdom and helping break down the barriers between God and people that are put up during times of suffering through contributing to my campaign and sharing it on social media, email, and in person. Thank you in advance for the impact that you are helping to create, and for blessing me in this process. </p>
<p>Be blessed. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>My name is Amy Rasmussen, and I love teaching kids of all ages at Oh Suzannah Music Studio. I've been teaching music for almost 20 years, and I've seen my students gain confidence, discipline, focus, the ability to self-calm, and best of all, the heart &amp; skills to worship God at home &amp; in public. My students have played in at least a dozen churches and multiple nursing homes. This is my intention as a teacher, to share the gift of music in a way that points my students and others to God's love! What else but Love could give us such a gift as music? </li>
<li>I will never get over how amazing it is that Rachel thought of our studio- <i>as she was preparing to enter hospice</i>. Rachel had wanted to open a studio similar to Oh Suzannah if she was able to get better. Yes, Rachel was an accomplished musician, yet an even more amazing person! She had a grace, a joy, and a peace surrounding her that would have set an environment of healing &amp; flourishing growth in her studio. I want to honor this beautiful intent of Rachel's heart by establishing a summer sponsorship program for kids who would significantly benefit from the opportunity.</li>
<li>If you contribute to this campaign, you will be providing for lessons, possibly ukuleles, time spent with caring mentors, and basic life-skills training for kids who need and want this opportunity. I have access to our county's foster kids as well as to many kids whose parents are or have been in jail, or are currently struggling with some life issue. Your contribution could literally change the course of a child's life. </li>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<li>For every $200 we can add one student per semester. </li>

<li>If we raise $4,000, we could purchase ukuleles for each student each summer so they have an instrument they can practice on &amp; keep<strong> if</strong> they meet their practice goals. (..achievable goals we will help them to meet :)</li>
<li>My dream is to offer a whole<strong> afternoon</strong> of teaching, reading, &amp; playing (screen-free!) to my sponsored kids two or three times a week in the summer. If you are interested in supporting a more immersive experience, please let me know!</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Jen Myzel.  I am a songwriter, ritualist, elementary school music teacher, and activist in Oakland, CA. I have been cultivating my songwriting skills over the past 11 years, with two studio albums, Family Tree and Silence Speak, as well as my most recent children’s sing-a-long book, Yellow Lotus Flower.  </p>
<p>I am now recording my third studio album, Birds of the Night! Of the ten songs on the album, half of the songs are ritualistic songs that are already being sung at prayer ceremonies, direct actions, and end-of-life ceremonies.  The other half are lyrical soul-pop songs that weave stories on critical topics including race, climate, hope, hopelessness, and belonging.  </p>
<p>The music ranges from hip-hop beats to folk rhythms to vocal looping and spoken word poetry.  As I grow as a person and in my career as a music teacher, my music is growing in its depth and skill, and I cannot wait to share this next album you. </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>We’re birds of the night</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>We’re taking flight</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>And we’ll fly through the dawn</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>‘Cause we’re moving on</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Yeah we’re moving on</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Yeah we’re moving on</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Speaking of the Birds of the Night, did I mention the music video? Five incredible activist-artist-healers have come together to sing and dance our prayers. All of us descend from different cultural lineages of this Earth. We are embodying bird goddesses, united around the fire, our wings open wide, ready to fly through the storm.  Our dance around the fire is interspersed with direct actions for the Amazon, and a powerful spoken word piece in Spanish by Maria Xiomara Dorsey.  Your pre-sales will help us complete and release this POWERFUL prayer of a music video!!!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This album will be musical medicine, and I believe our world needs more honest, deep, and inspiring messages.  I am pouring my heart and soul into this album, just like my previous works- Yellow Lotus Flower, Silence Speak, and Family Tree, and I trust these songs will find their way to the people who need to hear them, at the times when they are needed.  Songs from my previous works are being sung at weddings, funerals, gatherings, street protest, classrooms, and more.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
My name is Jen Myzel.  I am a songwriter, ritualist, elementary school music teacher, and activist in Oakland, CA. I have been cultivating my songwriting skills over the past 11 years, with two studio albums, Family Tree and Silence Speak, as well as my most recent children’s sing-a-long book, Yellow Lotus Flower.  
I am now recording my third studio album, Birds of the Night! Of the ten songs on the album, half of the songs are ritualistic songs that are already being sung at prayer ceremonies, direct actions, and end-of-life ceremonies.  The other half are lyrical soul-pop songs that weave stories on critical topics including race, climate, hope, hopelessness, and belonging.  
The music ranges from hip-hop beats to folk rhythms to vocal looping and spoken word poetry.  As I grow as a person and in my career as a music teacher, my music is growing in its depth and skill, and I cannot wait to share this next album you. 
 
We’re birds of the night
We’re taking flight
And we’ll fly through the dawn
‘Cause we’re moving on
Yeah we’re moving on
 
We’ve got the wind at our back
This is a sacred act
And we’ll fly through the dawn
‘Cause we’re moving on
Yeah we’re moving on
 
Speaking of the Birds of the Night, did I mention the music video? Five incredible activist-artist-healers have come together to sing and dance our prayers. All of us descend from different cultural lineages of this Earth. We are embodying bird goddesses, united around the fire, our wings open wide, ready to fly through the storm.  Our dance around the fire is interspersed with direct actions for the Amazon, and a powerful spoken word piece in Spanish by Maria Xiomara Dorsey.  Your pre-sales will help us complete and release this POWERFUL prayer of a music video!!!
Shout out to all of the incredible humans who are a part of this album:

Dyna Eria (vocals + bird goddess)
Masumi Hayashi-Smith (bird goddess)
Shakthi Ganeshan (bird goddess)
Maria Xiomara Dorsey (spoken word poetry)
Chad Wilkins (Vocals)
Lauren Brown (Vocals)
Clauco Belize (Photography)
Sarika Dagar (Film-maker + Director)
JonJon Alevazakis (Music  Production)
Eric Oberthaler (Music Production)
Maya Abramson (Violin)
David Lipps (Drums)
Simcha Schwartz (Idea-Bouncer, Head cheerleader + my fiance ;)


What We Need & What You Get

It will pay forward in the hearts and minds this music will touch.

$2,000 = Recording
$2,500 = Production, Mixing
$750 = Studio Musicians (drums, violin, backup vocals)
$1,000 = Mastering
$1,250 = Music Video 
$750 = Album, Poetry Pamphlet Printing, Shipping
$500 = Graphic Design
$250 = Album Release Concert
= $9,000

<h3>Help us make the first (and greatest) TINY BIT OF GIANT'S BLOOD full-length album!</h3>
<p>Hello, friends.</p>
<p>John Scholvin, Jackie Schimmel, Larry Beers,* and I have begun work on the FIRST EVER full-length album by TINY BIT OF GIANT’S BLOOD. We’re recording with Bryan Clavey at Crystall Recorders in Lombard (if you can find this hidden treasure, you get a cookie), the same place we made <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/album/34djmOzpuqHhQ918wWVits?si=EpbgbkJ_RSuakss2fLVGhA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our five-song debut EP (“Dram A”) </a>last year. </p>
<p>We’re creating 15 recordings of all-new material, and working hard to build what we hope will be a modern masterpiece of glam punk heavy rock in the spirit of Queen, David Bowie, Iggy Pop, Van Halen, Led Zeppelin, and other influences that have, at some point, impressed us with their implementation of gorgeous creative excess. It’s going to be pretty different from anything by our other bands (The Good, Sunshine Boys, Mucca Pazza, etc.) and we think you’re going to love it. </p>
<p>The album is dedicated to this premise:</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Sometimes you need to make yourself a little bigger.</h3>
<p>And in fact, we need to make our pile of dollars bigger to get through the process of finishing this release. By contributing to our campaign, you’ll help us cover</p>
<ul>
<li>studio costs</li>
<li>manufacturing expenses</li>

<li>engineers</li>
<li>producers</li>

<li>publicity expenses</li>
<li>and more</li>

<ul>
<li>special vials of giant’s blood</li>
<li>demos</li>
<li>limited edition t-shirts</li>
<li>handwritten lyrics</li>
</ul>
<p>And also once-in-a-lifetime experiences such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>custom songs</li>
<li>house concerts</li>
<li>your name in the liner notes</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll even be the first to receive THE FINISHED PRODUCT, in digital, vinyl, or CD (or all three!) formats. If all goes well and we get enough smackeroos, we hope to be able to unleash this sexy mastodon into the world in February 2020.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why are we asking for your help?</h3>
<p>Onstage we are giant, but in daily life we are puny humans doing everything ourselves. No record label, no promoter, no booking agent, just a few lifelong, notoriously unpaid musicians with spouses and kids and dogs, doing our best to make great stuff then hustling to the post office to deliver it to your gorgeous ears. We do a lot just by sheer hard work (lights, shoes, etc.), but the economies of releasing an actual full-length product go beyond our abilities to MacGyver them.  </p>

<h3>Peruse our sweet offerings and get them while they last. </h3>
<p>Take a look at all the ways you can help fund this project, at many levels. By contributing, you won't just get something unique / early / cool, you’ll get sneak peeks at the recording in process, and you’ll be the first to hear stuff as it’s made!</p>
<p>If you have questions about the campaign, or the band, or you’d just like to debate whether or not the black side of Queen II is the greatest 20 minutes of music ever recorded, please email us at TinyBitOfGiantsBlood@gmail.com.</p>
<p>And of course, whether you can donate or not, you can help us a ton by just sharing this campaign with your friends. </p>

<h3>The JEWCASTAR Story</h3>
<p>From 1999-2004 I toured Internationally performing Jewish music.  During that time, I had the vision to one day create a guitar that was shaped like a Star of David and had Jewish symbolism and spiritual intent.  It wasn't until 2019 that I met guitar maker Alexander Halverson and together this dream has become the Limited Edition Jewcastar Guitar.   </p>
<p>The most important thing to me and Alex was that the Jewcastar guitar would be a very high quality professional instrument first and a creative design second.  We've sourced the best quality materials in order to bring this versatile guitar to life and spent months perfecting the deign.  By contributing to our campaign you can help us to not only build more Jewcastars but to develop our guitar brand and create more professional quality guitars with new creative symbolic designs. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are hoping that you love the Limited Edition Jewcastar so much that you want to be one of the chosen ones that will rock the Jewcastar, but we recognize that not everyone is in a position to own this high-end, hand made, museum quality instrument.  For those that can purchase the guitar, you will get one or more semi-customized to your specs at a significantly discounted price and be one of up to 100 people in the world to own this design.  There is also an opportunity for a guitar shop to create their own one of a kind custom color to sell to their clients and to market their support of the Jewcastar brand.</p>
<p>For everyone else, you will be able to showcase your love for our campaign by proudly wearing shirts, hats, stickers, keychains, or gifting Jewcastar pics to your guitar loving friends and family!  For those that have a greater appreciation of hand made items and are able to help with a larger contribution you will get a hand made miniature of the Jewcastar Guitar built in Spain by  and/or our hand made Jewcastar Pic Box made by guitar maker Alexander Halverson.  About half of the money that we bring in will go to the high quality parts and materials.  The other half will help us to invest in a robotic wood carving machine in order for us to make instruments more quickly and with a more consistant look. We will also use some of the funding to upgrade our maker space which will enable us to make more guitars in a larger space.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Alex and I have a passion for building guitars!  We truly hope that the Jewcastar will help us to develop a community of people that can get behind our designs and support our dreams of creating guitars with intention.  We have more designs that we would love to create and share with the world!  Your support of our campaign will help us to develop more Jewcastars and other models which will help us to bring more instruments to market and fulfill our dream of building high-quality, beautiful, hand-made, professional instruments.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>At the moment we recognize that there are many professional guitar companies in the market and that most guitars that are sold are in the education/low end market.  That said, we believe that by creating a direct to buy approach and building unique, professional quality, semi-customized guitars that are inspired we can succeed in building guitars that give people the opportunity to be part of an inspired brand while playing an instrument that was made specifically for them!  You can choose your color, bridge style, 6 string or 7 string and select a 22 or 24 fret.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>The Limited Edition Jewcastar Guitar is being developed in order to build a community of backers and supporters that can help us to create more beautiful, high-end, hand crafted instruments.  There are many ways that people can help even if they can't directly contribute!  Please share share share our campaign...it will make your friends smile!  Tweet about us!! Share our campaign with media outlets, and use the Indiegogo share tools to easily let the world know that you believe in what we are doing. </p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The Dennis Kwok Jazz Orchestra needs your help in finishing our debut full-length album! The album consists of the ""Windward Bound"" suite, an original work for 19-piece jazz orchestra and multiple woodwind soloist. </p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>My name is <a href=""http://www.denniskwok.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dennis Kwok</a>, I am a saxophonist, composer and arranger based in Toronto. The Dennis Kwok Jazz Orchestra began as a passion project in 2017 as a way to give my music a voice and collaborate with many fine colleagues in the Greater Toronto Area. Over the last 3 years, we have performed in venues across Toronto, collaborated with some of Canada's finest, and now we're about ready to release the results of our hard work since our beginnings. </p>
<p>The ""Windward Bound"" Suite has been an idea festering in my head since the band started. I knew I wanted to find a way to combine my teenage memories of sailing, the folklore of life on the seas, my personal musical inspiration of large ensembles in all genres, and my assets as a woodwind performer. The result is 40 minutes of music that blends contemporary big band, wind ensemble, choral music, aleatoric discomfort, storytelling, and lots of woodwinds.</p>
<p>I'm very lucky to be working with these fine folk who also appear on the recording:</p>

<h3>What Is This For?</h3>
<p>I have been singing and writing for almost 15 years. I always tell people my music sounds like if Taylor Swift and Jewel had a music baby. Which makes sense, since they are my two biggest musical inspirations. In all this time, I have never professionally recorded any of my music, and I have decided it is finally time to put it out into the world. With your contribution to this campaign, I will be able to fully realize my vision with this album, and share it with anyone who has an interest in listening. </p>
<p>I have wanted to record my music for some time now, but have never felt as determined and passionate as I am about this project. If all goes as planned, I will have a physical copy available for purchase, as well as have it available for streaming on sites we all know and love. Any and all contributions help make this dream a reality, and I am incredibly excited for it to come to life.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How Much Is Needed, and Where Is It Going?</h3>
<p>In order to reach my goals, and release on the timeline I have created for myself, I will need somewhere in the range of $5,000. This will go towards recording, printing, and promoting my album, as well as helping to create merchandise that I can use as marketing material, as well as funding for whatever project I decide to work on next!</p>
<p>I have some fun things planned for those who contribute as well! Depending on how much you donate, I will be giving you something in return as a thank you for helping make my dream come true.</p>
<ul>
<li>for every $10 donation, I will curate a music playlist just for you</li>
<li>for every $20 donation, you will receive exclusive access to the Small Town Tragedy EP, featuring some old favorites. </li>
<li>for every $50 donation, I will send out a personal thank you, as well as give you exclsive access to the Small Town Tragedy EP</li>
<li>for every $100 donation, you will receive exclusive access to the Small Town Tragedy EP, a handwritten thank you note, and a limited edition Small Town Tragedy can koozie</li>
</ul>
<p>If I am not able to reach my goal of $5,000, any money collected will still go towards the making of my album. The project just may take a while longer to complete.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Could Go Wrong?</h3>
<p>This won't come without challenges, of course. Since I am new to the recording process, I have yet to learn what can (and probably will) go wrong along the way. It may take longer than expected, it may take a few tries, but I am determined to release music for all of us to enjoy.</p>
</div><div><h3>How Else Can I Help?</h3></div><p>As I previously said, any and all contributions help. And if you can't donate money, that's okay! Sharing the campaign and helping get the word out about this project will help tremendously as well. Indiegogo has a lot of great tools to help make sharing easy.</p><p>If you read this far, thank you. And if you are able to help in any way, THANK YOU. I am very excited for what the future holds for myself and my music. I'm thrilled that it is finally all happening, after All This Time.</p></div>","What Is This For?

<p>Born and raised in Flint, Michigan, Caleb Robinson is a multi-talented drummer who has been playing and learning the craft since the young age of three. He was inspired by watching his father play the drums at his grandparent’s church, and soon received his first pair of drumsticks to play at church, too. Along with drums, Caleb also plays bass and produces music. He describes his musical style as aggressive yet dynamic which can be compared to some of his musical influences like Tony Williams, Isaiah Rashad, Elvin Jones, Omar Hakim, and Thomas Pridgen. Like them, Caleb plays by the beat of his own drum, choosing to create and work with music that’s more embedded in jazz fusion and Hip-Hop; two genres that bring out the best in him. </p>
<p>I have built this campaign to raise money for my first album. The reason I am creating this album and building this campaign is, This music is a reflection of my life the last 2 years. The triumph of my life I think can touch many people in a deep and spiritual way. Some of my album has been funded out of my pocket. But to  continue to make a good product for you all, I'm asking for your help! The budget will be used to support Gordon  Van Gent for my mixing and mastering, art work and press.</p>
</div><div>
<p>Creating an album as an artist is very time consuming and expensive.  Right now there is a deadly virus going on that has put me and a lot of other full time musicians, artist and creators out of work. Yet and still I believe this is the perfect time to give the world this music. </p>
<p>I want to be a bridge for other musicians to get their music and skills heard and developed through whatever influence I gain from this. Also, I want to start a spark in someone's life, even if it's just one. A spark for healing.</p>

<h3>15 years in the making...</h3>
<p>Well. Kind of. Our last album was all the way back in 2005. Since then the band have been semi active always playing a few times a year. Always having fun.</p>
<p>Throughout this time Si has never stopped writing. It's what he does. There have been dozens of behind the scenes demos yet for one reason or another real life has got in the way of us booking studio time and putting all the ideas into action.</p>
<p>The emergence of local to the band producer Paul West @ paulwestproduction.com ; has given us the freedom to record at our convenience while we juggle busy family lives.</p>
<p>It's given us a new lease of life having a world class producer on our door step.</p>
<p>We saved for 18 months out of our own pockets to record this album and that bought us half the record. The other half is borrowed.</p>
<p>It's money well spent.</p>
<p>This is by far and away the best we've sounded on tape (yeah OK it's not tape pedant fans) and is also the best collection of songs Si has written (imo).</p>
<p>So - I hear you ask - if you have already paid for the recording then why the crowd funder? Simple. We want to crack on recording the next batch of songs but need to ensure this one is bought and paid for before we do.</p>
<p>This is where you come in...</p>
</div><div>
<h3>3dBs Down need YOU</h3>
<p>We could slap the album on streaming platform straight away but the truth is *whispers* artists make next to feck all off streaming platforms *whispers*</p>
<p>So we decided to put together these CD + merch packages. When target is met we can use the money raised to get everything manufactured.</p>
<p>Anything over and above goes into paying off borrowed recording costs.</p>
<p>Anything over and above that goes into the kitty for the next release.</p>
<p>Here's the thing though. The album is finished and you will be able to download your copy straight away when you buy <i>any</i> of the Perks (allowing us 24-48 hours to email the download code to you)</p>
<p>Back of the net.</p>
<p><strong>Full disclosure: </strong>We will be putting the record on streaming platforms in the future but not this side of Christmas.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The future</h3>
<p>Have a look and listen of the preview video the incredibly talented Jim Wheeler has put together. It's at the top of this page. See what you think.</p>
<p>If you like what you hear; help us make more music by purchasing a perk package if you can or maybe tell a friend if you can't (preferably by using the Indiegogo share tools).</p>
<p>If you do both. Well. Cripes. That's a magnificent effort.</p>
<p>Although to be honest - if you've managed to make it this far down the page then that is an equally impressive effort.</p>

<p><strong>I AM INVITING YOU TO PRE-ORDER MY NEW ALBUM</strong></p>
<p>I am very proud to have been invited to sing in Australia, Germany, Austria and Israel this year. Unfortunately, many of my concerts have been cancelled or rescheduled to 2021 due to the <strong>global pandemic</strong>.</p>
<p>As an independent artist, the current global crisis has hit me hard like many others. Despite the current obstacles, I wish to complete my new album during June 2020. If I receive enough pre-orders in 40 days, I will be able to proceed with my final recordings and complete this album of beautiful songs from <strong>Opera, Musicals, Films, Pop and Jazz</strong>. I hope that my new album will bring you  joy, hope and good energy during this very challenging time. With your support I can  complete my album and have it sent out to you by July 2020. This will guarantee a physical CD <strong>signed with a personal dedication</strong>.</p> <p>My new album will feature songs from opera, musicals, film, pop songs and jazz. All songs are very emotional and in different languages  (German, Italian, Spanish, English and Hebrew). This album touches on our current times. I truly hope that through my music people will feel a sense of <strong>hope and unity</strong>.</p>
<p>Please help me share this<strong> pre-order </strong>crowdfunding page worldwide! We have 30 days to reach our target. Thank you so much for taking the time and for your kind support throughout my campaign!!!</p>

Dieses Album wird eine wundervolle Mischung aus Arien, Pop-, Jazz- und Musical- Liedern sein.<br/>Um dieses Album für Euch fertigzustellen zu können, habe ich beschlossen, ein Crowdfunding-Kampagne für mein neues Album zu starten. Es müssen innerhalb von 30 Tagen genug CDs vorbestellt werden, damit ich mein neues Album bis Juni fertigstellen, drucken und pressen kann.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This will be the debut big band album by the 'Minnie Big Band', led by Melbourne based arranger and composer Minnie Hill. This album will feature the music of Dave Brubeck and will celebrate what would have been his 100th birthday. The album will include an all-star lineup of many of Melbourne's top jazz musicians and emerging students. It is hoped that  this crowdfunding campaign will raise $3000 to go towards expenses such as musician and studio fees. This platform will mainly be used for reordering of the album or for general donations. Thank you so much for taking the time to check out my crowdfunding and music! I absolutely cannot wait for the recording in December and to share this album with you.</p>
<p>The big band will also be joined by Jack Earle on piano and Carlo Barbaro on alto saxophone in a feature role as a tribute to both Dave Brubeck and Paul Desmond. The album will consist mostly of Dave Brubeck's compositions that have been arranged for full big band.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Band</h3>
<p>WOW! This band is amazing, really, they are. I'm so thrilled to have a band of this quality playing my music. Check out the lineup below.</p>
<p>Saxophones: Carlo Barbaro, Tim Wilson, Flora Carbo, Sam Ondaatje, Cheryl Clarke, Mia Barham</p>
<p>Trumpets: Mick Fraser, Alex Howroyd, Gianni Marinucci, Thien Pham</p>

While Minnie arranges for her own projects and bands, she has also composed and arranged music for the Daryl McKenzie Jazz Orchestra, Paris Cat Big Band and both Jazz Melbourne Studio Youth Big Bands.</p>
<p>In 2020, Minnie's arrangement of 'Play Crazy For Me' won 1st place in the inaugural Musicians Arranging Guild of Australia Youth Arranging Competition. The competition was open to arrangers Australia wide that were under 30 years of age, while Minnie is younger than her other writing peers, she sees this as the start of a long and established career within the Melbourne music community. This arrangement can be found at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35-5YbY6F0E&amp;feature=emb_title"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35-5YbY6F0E&amp;amp...</a></p>
<p>In 2019, Minnie's big band composition 'Silver's Swing' was selected for the VCAA 'Top Sounds' concert, recorded at the Iwaki Auditorium in Melbourne and highlighted the best student compositions across Victoria.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>For over a decade I have been wanting to record a full length Christmas album with my band The Calabash Club including all the bells, whistles, pedal steel, glockenspiel and horns and elves... well you get it. This dream has finally come to fruition and has far exceeded my expectations. On a cold winter night a few days before Christmas in 2019 the sessions for ""Christmasland Jubilee"" began at The Noise Floor Recording Studio in Dover, NH. I filled the studio with Christmas decorations galore and I felt completely lifted by the whole experience. For every studio session after that I would decorate, make cookies and hot cocoa for my musical friends playing on this album... and dress up like Santa Claus to greet them. I am completely enamored by these fine musicians who brought so much holiday magic to this album! And as for the (((vibe))) I was looking to capture on this album they all nailed it! I had tears of joy rolling down my cheeks so many times... a completely enchanted experience. This album contains seven original Christmas songs by yours truly... Dan Blakeslee.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>I need your support to bring this album to the surface. I began recording this album in December of 2019 and continued to record it through January, February... and upon the last weeks of wrapping up the recording in March the pandemic came in postponing it's completion for many months. I have been working tirelessly to finish it.</p>
<p>Those of you who back this record will receive the digital download of the album before anyone else is able to hear it. The slated release is mid November the date to be determined. </p>
<p>I am getting VINYL made for this one as this album was MADE for vinyl! This is a huge financial undertaking and I urge you to hop in this one quick if you want this option. Vinyl is never cheap to make but ALWAYS worth it! I am doing deluxe album packaging for this record with a silkscreened album cover and extensive liner notes. Vinyl usually takes months to get made... I am working with the kind folks at Burlington Record Plant to try to get this in your stockings by the end of December... it might be in January though... I will keep you in the loop. They are total pros and they put in extra effort to make sure that album sounds great and looks great which means it takes extra time.</p>
<p>Along with making vinyl, CD's, tshirts and hand silkscreened felt stockings to hang above your mantle I am also making three home made ""Christmas Story"" esque ""leg lamps"". These are going to be expensive to ship and very ""fragile"" so I am not sure if I will be putting them in this fundraiser but they will be available at some point before Christmas. It also takes me about a week to make each one so I will work my elf hands as diligently as possible!</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>All that you contribute will help me finish paying to get the album completed, musicians paid, physical albums made plus an album promotion campaign. I am one person behind the helm doing everything so your financial help is more crucial than ever before. I have no label support and doing this out of pocket (though not one cent has been wasted) as it has fulfilled this long time dream of mine to record a Christmas album like this one you are about to hear.</p>
<p>Even if you don't have the funds to support this record please do share about this fundraiser on social media... I am one person trying to do everything I can to get this album as wide spread as possible and I need all the elves I can get to help bring this album to all those folks in need of some audible holiday cheer.</p>
<p>I can't thank all of you enough for reading this and being part of a grassroots effort to bring a new Christmas album into the world. You are all snow angels!</p>
<p>By the way not one ounce of irony was recorded in this album, it is a sincere, heartfelt, rollicking holiday listening experience... I hope you are ready!</p>
<p>Please be safe and healthy!</p>

<h3>Philly Godmother: the music of Trudy Pitts</h3>
<p>  <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Hey there! My name is Jarad Astin, I am a jazz musician and producer, and am enlisting fellow lovers of jazz organ to jump on board with an amazing and unique project - an album dedicated to the music of the late Trudy Pitts.

<h3><b>The Lowdown</b></h3>
<p><b>    </b>Rather than sit back and let Covid slow my creativity at a standstill, I opted to use the time to get back into the studio to finish some projects that have been looming, ones that a busy performance schedule made difficult to achieve. Over the summer I managed to pull off a session with a couple of players I’ve known for years out of NYC, drummer Brian Floody and the great guitarist Ed Cherry, both of whom have incredible resumes including work with Dizzy Gillespie, Fathead Newman, John Patton, and so many more. Now I am asking you to help me get the project out in the open! <br/>    One thing we are seeing right now is an absolute flood of new music coming from all angles and genres, as artists are not able to perform many are doing the same as I have - which makes releasing a bit more difficult to get above the “noise.” I am raising $11,500 to make this project happen in a manner fitting to someone of Trudy’s stature - the funds will cover artwork, PR by Lisa Reedy (a highly regarded jazz-centric publicist out of NYC), distribution to over 150 retro-minded international record outlets, release on all the major (and minor) digital platforms, a limited-edition pressing on Vinyl and CD, donations to the National Pancreatic Cancer Association and American Lupus Foundation in lieu of licensing fees (as per Trudy’s estate) and session costs - and by supporting this project you not only are lifting up the work of this amazing artist but supporting relevant medical research and the cats on the record, who are in and of themselves pillars in the foundation of the current flow of jazz!</p>
<p> I’m offering some great perks to you for supporting this project, check this out: </p>
<ul>
<li>      $50 gets you a copy of the record on enhanced CD as well as a full-resolution download to dig while you jog around the block or walk the dog...and the chance to privately stream the record RIGHT AWAY to check out what you’re putting your hard-earned dollars towards! That means YOU get to hear it before ANYONE else. That’s serious...</li>
<li>      $100 gets you 2 copies, the full-res download as well as a “Who’s Hip” listing in the liner notes of a limited-edition CD and access to some killing session video</li>
<li>     $200 is gonna land you a copy of the vinyl pressing, 2 CD’s with a “Who’s Hip’ listing in the liner and access to the video footage...oh yeah, and don’t forget that pre-release access that NOBODY ELSE IS GETTIN’!</li>
<li>     $500 is big, baby - in addition to all the above you’ll receive a copy of my latest organ pressing on Vinyl, “Carpe Diem,” with the Boogaloo Communicators, the best record I’ve ever had the joy of getting to wax...and get hip to this, you’ll be named in the “Producer’s Circle” on the fist limited-edition run of the vinyl pressing! That’ll be one to impress even the stodgiest niece or nephew!</li>
<li>    $2,000 will get you to the moon - everything in the above package as well as a PRIVATE concert with the trio; given current Covid restrictions this’ll be challenging, but we can hook you up with a pro-level, multi-cam livestream and beam it anywhere you are in the world...and hook you up with a vid to remember the whole shebang. If you happen to be within a couple hours of NYC and wanna wait for things to clear, guess what?! We’ll nail it right in your living room! (will require some scheduling of course, but we’d rather play to a live audience!!) </li>
</ul>
<p>  <strong>So what happens if we don’t quite make the mark? Ya had to ask....</strong></p>
<p>       I’ve been at this recording thing a long time - the best part is we’ve ALREADY RECORDED AND MASTERED THE SESSION! At least that takes some of the edge off...At the minimum, we’re going for the limited run of vinyl and basic international distribution to some of the HIPPEST record shops on the planet. Trudy’s music speaks it’s own volumes, and in the right hands the project could very well take on it’s own life through some copious self-promotion in the regular guerrilla channels (Social Media, hounding phone calls...you know the deal). <br/>        Back us up, and we could very well be looking at a Grammy nomination. That’ll put you at the forefront of one of 2021’s happeninest digs. You’ll be a part of spreading the love that was, and IS, Trudy Pitts, sending a message to the world that YOUR culture is not only meaningful but full of some deep-soul...and groovy as the day is long. We invented groovin’ high, so let’s embrace it and tell ‘me all! Drop a dime, share the news, and help this album cut through all the noise. </p>
<p>  So what are you waiting for? If you’re still with me, you’re a down individual. Let’s get it together! Can’t swing a contribution at the moment? No problemo! How bout this...share, share, share!! Help us get the word out and nail this sucker to the floor. I know we got some social-media superstars out there who can really help us put this thing on the map, and we can make it worth the effort by offering you access to the private stream for your first 100 confirmed shares to your network...That’s called “sweat equity.”</p>
<p>  Thanks for hanging with me, thanks for giving this a shot in your busy schedule. Music is light, and light is love!</p>

  Hey there! My name is Jarad Astin, I am a jazz musician and producer, and am enlisting fellow lovers of jazz organ to jump on board with an amazing and unique project - an album dedicated to the music of the late Trudy Pitts. I had the luxury of studying organ with Trudy in the late 90’s while living in Philadelphia, and man is her tunes are smokin’! So who am I? I’m a trained pro - and I’ve owned and operated CueBro Productions since 2001, having since produced over 20 records in a wide swath of styles.

<h3>Story</h3>
<p>Hey and welcome to the crowdfunding campaign of ""The Dark Canyon"". I am Keven Eknes, a Norwegian guitar player based in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>2020/21 have been an insanely hard year for everyone, especially music industry professionals. Personally, I went from having a fully booked year of shows and tours throughout 2020 to literally nothing. As a gig-worker, any work not executed ends up with virtually zero compensation. I had to change my entire working career from having my salary based upon live shows and touring, to videography based content creation. It has been a hard journey, but a good story was gained from it. This is my story through the music. With the change of career I ended up writing a lot of songs for gear demos, and ""The Dark Canyon"" will include extensions from the inspirations found in music during the pandemic. I hope this music can inspire you.</p>
<p>Funding an original music release as an independent musician is extremely costly, but the crowdfunding can be an amazing way for you to help the creation of this album.</p>

<p><strong>Malaga</strong> is the Samoan word for ""journey.""</p>
<p><strong>Co-created by Igelese Ete and Jakki Leota-Mua.</strong> <strong>Malaga </strong>is an oceanic multi-movement, choreographed choral celebration, composed by world renowned composer/conductor and musical director Igelese Ete with guests works by other invited pacific composers.</p>
<p><strong>Malaga</strong> is a deeply-moving spiritual journey depicting the movement of a people from Hawai’iki to new homelands. For the first time ever, <strong>Malaga will be showcased in Los Angeles on Saturday, June 29th, 2019 at El Rey Theatre.</strong></p>
<p>Remaining true to the source – our Atua/God – as well as to the sea, we are inspired by the ancient navigational history of Oceanic peoples.</p>
<p>We then compare these to the stories, emotions and experiences of more recent voyagers taken by our grandparents and parents.</p>
<p><strong>Malaga</strong> is hope, in the ever moving present.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>

Co-created by Igelese Ete and Jakki Leota-Mua. Malaga is an oceanic multi-movement, choreographed choral celebration, composed by world renowned composer/conductor and musical director Igelese Ete with guests works by other invited pacific composers.
Malaga is a deeply-moving spiritual journey depicting the movement of a people from Hawai’iki to new homelands. For the first time ever, Malaga will be showcased in Los Angeles on Saturday, June 29th, 2019 at El Rey Theatre.
Remaining true to the source – our Atua/God – as well as to the sea, we are inspired by the ancient navigational history of Oceanic peoples.
We then compare these to the stories, emotions and experiences of more recent voyagers taken by our grandparents and parents.
Malaga is hope, in the ever moving present.
Malaga is symbol for our status as ‘visitors.’ For our ‘state’ of in-betweenness. In the ‘Va’/Space. That place connecting this homeland and the last, between this Island and the next.
Some have said it is in our ‘blood to be mobile’. Forever exploring, forever enlarging; our minds, our hearts and our learning into new horizons. Inscribing within us still, the values, ethics, languages and heritage/s to which we will always belong.
Malaga is a metaphor. As individuals from a variety of Pasifika backgrounds, we unite. We know that together as a family/aiga/ohana we will overcome and conquer all challenges in life.

And that's not including publishing, distribution, marketing, merchandise, and physical album production costs. 
All said and done, this album will probably cost around $10000. That said, we want EVERYONE to hear our new music and you can pre-order your copy now!
Also, if we get more than our goal, we'll be able to add bonus tracks and other extras like music videos and additional merch!
If we don't reach our goal, we will release another EP based on what we can afford to record. We would love to get a full length album released, but another EP would at least get some of our new tunes out to you all.


THE PERKS!!
We've created some solid perks for this campaign. Here are some of the highlights!


Steve's Epiphone Les Paul custom and case!  SOLD OUT!

Private album release party in Rochester, NY!
Name a song off the new album!

Private hangout with Mulu Lizi!

Signed CD's and memorabilia!
Contributor credits on the CD sleeve!
Shout outs on social media!










Post production plans:
Once the album is completed, we will publish, promote, and license the works. We've developed connections within the industry that will help us accomplish this. 
We'll also create merch based on the new tracks/imagery and if we have enough funds, we'll create new music videos!
All of this will cost a ton and require a lot of effort on our part. We'll be writing, recording, working with the sound engineer to mix/edit/produce. And we'll still be playing gigs as well!
   Risks & Challenges:
We are constantly faced with challenges, but we always work through them and grow as a group. If we run into any obstacles, we will find a solution and work our way through them.  
  Other ways YOU can help:
 We understand if you can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't be a part of this project!


Get the word out and make some noise about this campaign!
Talk to us and make suggestions. We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Use the Indiegogo share tools to promote through social media!

Lastly, we'd like to say thank you to everyone involved in 
everything we do. This is a dream for us, and you are all making it come
 true!",4.0,2,"1 Campaign

<br/>About my album</h3> <p></p>
<p>On the album, there will be 6 to 10 songs. They all will be connected with foreign theme. Michaela first wants to record the song with the name <b>Autumn Song</b>. Sure it must be about love. Autumn is used just like metaphors for the period of love when people feel, that their love is reaching to end. Lets see how this story will finish when the song will be ready.</p>
<p>One of the next songs will be <b>Small Sad Star</b>. It´s o dynamical song about a friendship and loneliness. Everybody feel lonely sometimes even they have many people around. This song will be about the deep feelings of the singer. Refren of this song will make everybody love it!</p>
<p>One of the songs will have the name <b>Foreigner </b>as the album name. This song will be based on a dance music. Song will tell, the distance to stars is less then the distance between people that they don't understand each other. It can happen also to you, if you are foreign.<br/><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Me</h3> <p></p>

Cocktail Time, a universal concept to unwind after work now has its own anthem!

Our most generous supporters will have the chance to savor the dishes of ""Maryland's Best Chef"" and be a part of the Happy Crowd at the bar. It will be filmed by Duane Edward Sanchez who is garnering a great reputation for his music video and theater work in Baltimore, Denver and New York.

based out of Chicago, IL. We specialize in limited edition runs of physical
merchandise. Each tape/cd is crafted to the artists needs and liking. We have
been in the game since May 2013 and we’re still pushing.</span><br/></p>
<p>We are trying to raise money to secure our
venue space during SXSW. We launched our cassette tape fundraiser a week ago
and now we need a little extra push to get us to our target goal. This
fundraiser is important because it will open a lot of doors for not only the
artists, but for Scenic Rhythms as well. It will also help Scenic Rhythms be
able to give back financially to the artists who are performing that night. We’re
all about giving back and remembering that we all are artists ourselves and to
be able to get something back during SXSW would be amazing.</p>
<p>Donating to our campaign will help with so
much. It will secure our space, allow us to pay the artists for their time as
well as have some more perks at the show. Every dollar goes a long way and will
help us out tremendously.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p><ul>
</ul>
<p>Our over all goal is $1700. $1200 is to secure
our space and the other $500 is the damages fee for the venue. When we’ve hit
our target goal the rest of the funds will be used to getting the t-shirts and
a few more batches of tapes.</p>
<p>We’ve got a special T-shirt that was designed
for Scenic Rhythms by our founder iNDiG0HiGH. They’re created from Print All
Over Me and are good quality shirts. We have a cassette tape that has our
lineup’s music on it, tracks in total. You can either get the tape by itself,
the shirt by itself, or you can get both in a package.</p>
<p>If we don’t reach our goal, then the funds
will go towards pressing the tapes and shirts.</p>
<p><br/></p><ul>
</ul>
<p>The value in being able to perform during SXSW
is so big. It’s a huge networking opportunity and can open a lot of doors for multiple
things to happen. All Scenic Rhythms wants to do is maximize the opportunity
and make sure the artists get paid from it. From the research that has been
obtained, not a lot of artists get a paid show during SXSW and paying to play
is wack. We’re setting up a platform for artists to make money and do what they
love. Hopefully people will grasp that we aren’t like the rest and strive to be
better and different in every way possible.</p>
<p>This is our first time hosting an event like
this, and hopefully it won’t be the last.</p>
<p>We’re passionate about the artists that are on
this bill and really want to make this event happen. For some this will
probably be the only performance they have and we want to make it count in a
huge way. So please help us, help them.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We’ve put a lot of time and energy into making
sure that we have a secure place to play and a good quality product that sets
us apart from everyone else. Cassette tapes are definitely on a slow comeback
track, but over all it’s a form of art. Selling cassettes are a little
difficult, but I can guarantee that the product is good. We just need that
extra cushion to make this a reality for everyone involved.</p>
<p>All we can do is push ourselves to the max with this one. We’ve
put our hearts and souls into the music and products that you see, so hopefully
you’ll see that and would love to help. We really appreciate everything.</p>

</div></div>","My new album is in the works! 





Greetings friends!
This album is a vision into my inner world where melody reigns supreme, vocals soar over lush horn and string arrangements. A piano melts us, as classical guitar rises up our spine and a choir shakes the rest of our bones. 


My vocally-driven music has elements of folk, funk, blues and jazz but also contains something new, undefined and I hope you find the result very moving.




The Album Recording ProcessI am utilizing my skills as producer and mixing engineer, working with an assistant engineer and co-producer for the studio sessions. I have the opportunity to work with a very talented vocal coach,  Raz Kennedy (vocalist for Bobby Mcferrin, Al Jarreau, Carlos Santana, etc.) and I'm planning to feature the great hammond B3 player, Melvin Seals (Jerry Garcia Band, JGB) as well as many other incredibly talented musicians on the album!
I hope you are as excited as I am for that moment when the mastered version is done and it hits our ears, but I can't get their without your help!
 -Nigel Ravenwind




What is the inspiration for this new music?
Many of us have felt disenchanted by the culture we grew up in. The overload of sense gratification and consumerism gone rampant takes a toll on our well being. 
Yet, it is impossible to be separate from the Earth when everything around us, originates first from her!
Mother nature not only sustains, but she also destroys and gives birth anew. We have to let things die and re-birth in order to create balance in our works, not just sustain them. The primary disease in this era of ""Too Big to Fail"" is not making that connection to the cycles and presence of the earth around us. That's why I call this album ""The Great Re-Enchantment."" I feel its most important to be re-enchanted by her endless offerings of well-being and balance. When we are in tune with the cycles of nature, its easier to feel connected to our passion and the heart of our being. My music is a prayer, vocalizing and wishing that anyone who hears this music, is aided in their return to right relationship with the earth.

Music helps us fortify our inherent medicine and carry it into our lives and onwards into the lives of our relatives, loved ones, and greater community.By supporting this album, you are also supporting a team of independent musicians and production team as well as the further flowering of similar musical works to come!

They bring a new energy to my music, and it will be such a treat to finally capture our live band sound on the album.THE BAND:(from left to right)Andreas Wallner - electric guitar, acoustic guitarChris Vano - piano, keys, synthesizersMe - acoustic guitar, vocals Andi Senn - drums, percussionWolfgang Henn - electric bass, double bassWe will make the record in October at Inntime Studio in Mils, Austria with the help of sound engineer extraordinaire, Stefan Wolf. Stefan is passionate about capturing the songs and providing the utmost quality in the album's overall tone. And I am pleased to announce that the album will be released in Europe on LEASH THE DOGS RECORDS,  a boutique label recently formed by the team at Inntime Studio. Combined, they have decades of experience working on major label and independent musical projects, including their own formidable touring and recording careers. My consultant and co-manager, the brilliant Sebastian Obermeir, will also be on-board during this process. I am extremely grateful to all for their support. The album will also be released in Canada, and worldwide via online platforms. WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS MEAN:You are friends and family and fans, both familiar and new, and I adore you. Your contributions will pay for the studio time, the engineer, the musicians, and the mixing and mastering of my new record. All of these things cost considerable amounts of money and time. When the funding goal of $7000 is reached, I will be able to see the recording to completion, and realize a dream of mine to make this new album here in Austria with my amazing band. Should your contributions go above and beyond the goal, they will be applied to the costs of manufacturing physical copies, and to marketing and promotion. I am offering PERKS/INCENTIVES in return for your funding! Please find them listed on the right portion of this page. An alternative way to see my campaign succeed is to PLEASE HELP SPREAD THE WORD. Sharing it word-of-mouth and on your Facebook and Twitter will go a long way. THIS SHIP WILL SAIL STRAIGHT TOWARDS MAKING A NEW RECORD, THANKS TO YOU. I AM HUMBLED AND FOREVER GRATEFUL FOR YOUR SUPPORT. ALL ABOARD! LET'S SET SAIL.Special thanks to Sebastian Obermeir, Joe Auer, Stephan Gerber, Christina Martin, Dale Murray, Erin Costelo, my band, and Leash The Dogs Records for their help with creating this campaign.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

My song <b>'Show Your Love'</b>, that I originally auditioned for a solo with at Starstruck, was then chosen to be a featured song at Starstruck and was performed proudly by me at every show. That was a huge moment for me! It was the first time more than just my family were going to see my work and hear my voice! Up to <b>5,000 </b>people a show, with 4 shows, it was an amazing experience and I'll never forget it! What came from this was a contact with someone who recorded a very generalised version of my song 'Going Too Fast'. After that I decided that my songwriting was something that I really wanted to keep impressing people with.<br/>

<br/>So I kept writing songs, talking to my family about the day I would supposedly become a big professional and be able to change the world. How young and naive I was - or so I thought. It wasn't until a couple of years ago in April, that I recorded a song I'd recently written about bullying called <b>'You're Not Innocent' </b>and uploaded it to Facebook as a tester to see whether I should put my stuff on YouTube or not. The song's meaning is to make people aware of what they're saying or doing to others before it gets to a point where an apology can't fix anything. Funnily enough, this song went viral  and after putting it on YouTube and watching it over the past two years, it now has over <b>650,000 views</b> and has been recorded in a studio and is up on <b>iTunes</b>! It's a massive achievement for me and I'm very proud of myself.</div>

</div>
<div>But here is a summary of what people have been saying. There have been numerous comments, all wonderful, and a lot of them explaining their own experiences with bullying but what really amazed me was the amount of comments that had stated this song, MY SONG, had stopped them from both self harming and bullying and had even encouraged some to speak up about themselves or others being bullied. A few comments taken from youtube:</div>
<div>
<p>""This song saved my life tonight…….”</p>
<p>""this song has saved my life”</p>
<p>""U really changed my life thank you “</p>
<p>“This song made me stop self harming it just proves that I’m not alone and there are other people in my shoes too, and it also tell me to ignore the bullies cuz they will end up feeling guilty”</p>
<p>“You thought (taught) me how to stand up for other people”</p>
</div>
<div>The outcome was more than I ever could have imagined and that is why I am here today asking for your generosity!<br/>

</div></div>","Hi there! So, my name is CODI KAYE, I'm a singer/songwriter/guitarist (kind of) who could really use your help in releasing my debut album into the world! Since I was a little kiddy I have been creating poems and stories about all kinds of things! But when I was about 13, I wrote a song... a song that actually meant something. (WOW!) It was called 'Going Too Fast' and it was about a girl who didn't want to be pressured into anything sexual too early in her life, as she had a lot of seeing and experiencing to do before she wanted to delve into that world.
This song was the start for me, and I then continued to write songs about all kinds of things that were going on not only in my life but the people I saw, the people I knew and the things that were going on in the world that I had an opinion about.Starstruck is a Hunter Schools Performing Arts Show. My song 'Show Your Love', that I originally auditioned for a solo with at Starstruck, was then chosen to be a featured song at Starstruck and was performed proudly by me at every show. That was a huge moment for me! It was the first time more than just my family were going to see my work and hear my voice! Up to 5,000 people a show, with 4 shows, it was an amazing experience and I'll never forget it! What came from this was a contact with someone who recorded a very generalised version of my song 'Going Too Fast'. After that I decided that my songwriting was something that I really wanted to keep impressing people with.



So I kept writing songs, talking to my family about the day I would supposedly become a big professional and be able to change the world. How young and naive I was - or so I thought. It wasn't until a couple of years ago in April, that I recorded a song I'd recently written about bullying called 'You're Not Innocent' and uploaded it to Facebook as a tester to see whether I should put my stuff on YouTube or not. The song's meaning is to make people aware of what they're saying or doing to others before it gets to a point where an apology can't fix anything. Funnily enough, this song went viral  and after putting it on YouTube and watching it over the past two years, it now has over 650,000 views and has been recorded in a studio and is up on iTunes! It's a massive achievement for me and I'm very proud of myself.
If you'd like to buy the song or hear the recorded version visit this link (or type Codi Kaye You're Not Innocent into your iTunes Store! 

https://itunes.apple.com/au/album/youre-not-innocent-single/id904040112





But here is a summary of what people have been saying. There have been numerous comments, all wonderful, and a lot of them explaining their own experiences with bullying but what really amazed me was the amount of comments that had stated this song, MY SONG, had stopped them from both self harming and bullying and had even encouraged some to speak up about themselves or others being bullied. A few comments taken from youtube:

""This song saved my life tonight…….”
""this song has saved my life”
""U really changed my life thank you “
“This song made me stop self harming it just proves that I’m not alone and there are other people in my shoes too, and it also tell me to ignore the bullies cuz they will end up feeling guilty”
“You thought (taught) me how to stand up for other people”

The outcome was more than I ever could have imagined and that is why I am here today asking for your generosity!


'You're Not Innocent' was the first of many songs I have written and uploaded to YouTube. Most of my songs explore social issues such as domestic violence, sexual harassment/rape, mental health issues especially surrounding that of low self esteem and I even delve into the good old heartbreak. I've got a load of songs not yet uploaded to YouTube that I will definitely be making a goal within the next few months. These songs explore growing up, the horrible toll of a terminal illness such as cancer, and discovering who I am. 
This is one of my most recent originals, about how a lot of women and men are sexually abused - and that it's not a matter of how you dress or present yourself, it can happen to even the most conservative of people.


My music is super indie folk/soul/acoustic-like (or that's how I'm hoping it will be) and my motives are to help people all around the world relate to music and for my songs to speak out about the things that they may be too scared to say for themselves! 

One of my proudest moments so far, was a girl who has a special connection to my song 'You're Not Innocent' actually got the name of the song and my name tattooed on her back. (It wasn't me, I promise)



These songs are my entire world and they mean so much to me, and as I've witnessed, they now mean so much to the people who have listened, and can relate to them.My goal, and my potential career, that I would more than anything love to achieve is to be touring around the world in a big tour bus singing the songs I've put priceless effort into and hopefully changing people's lives for the better, as well as producing good music.Obviously you guys aren't able to get me the whole way, but if you have read this far then I hope it's because you are interested in what I would like to do in my life. What you can help me with, is donating as much as you feel necessary or I deserve for my cause, so that I can record and distribute my songs and get them out and into the world! This would help me so much because as I mentioned before, I'm only 18! I don't have 20k stashed away in my bank! I am trying to save money of my own for this, as performing/busking is currently my job, but if you guys could help with the rest I would appreciate it more than you could imagine!

This money would go towards studio time to record my debut album, distributing the album onto CDs and releasing it in as many places as possible. It would also go towards getting them onto places like iTunes and Amazon, and to promoting both my YouTube and my Facebook pages where I do my best to help people personally as well as with my music. Leftover money will go towards funding shows, merchandise or equipment to better my professionalism in this industry.There aren't many artists out there these days with so much meaning to their music, it's quickly becoming an industry consumed by making money. (This is ironic as I am asking you for money.) But as much as starting out costs a lot my goal isn't to be rich, my goal is to help people all around the world, with something all humans have in common, a love for music!Please allow me this chance! :)You can visit my youtube/facebook/ instagram and twitter accounts by clicking on these links, if you'd like to delve a bit more into what I do!

<p>My name is Andy Shaw, and I'm making a record. </p>
<div>In January of 2014 I made it a mission to go into the recording studio to record a full length album of unreleased material. Some of the songs I've performed in <a href=""www.AndyShawBand.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Andy Shaw Band</a> and <a href=""www.ShawBrothersMusic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Shaw Brothers</a>, while a few of them have never been performed.  After going into the studio I quickly realized the excitement of seeing these songs come together, and couldn't wait to share what I was working on<span style=""background-color: initial;"">. It was also a true pleasure to work with engineer Chad Loughrige, as well as all of the musicians who performed on the album.</span>
</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div>Now that the record is nearing it's end, I need your help releasing it! The friends, family, and supporters in my life mean everything to me, and I really look forward to sharing this with you.  I just need a little bit of support to help me get this record out.<br/>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My goal is to raise at least half of the money of the total cost. This will go towards paying for the following things.</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Recording, Mixing, and Mastering costs - I really loved recording this record, and I ended up spending over a hundred hours on recording, mixing, and mastering. Needless to say, it all adds up, but the skills of the individuals I worked with made it all worthwhile. (Est cost to date: $2,500-$3,000)</li>
<li>Art Work - Album design, Poster design, and Photography (Est cost: $300)</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul><li>Album Pressing - 500 albums (Est Cost: $1,200)</li></ul>
</div> <p>Total Cost of above: $4,000-$4,500<br/></p>
<h3>Contributors</h3>

<p><b>Violin</b>- Chris Shaw</p>

<i>The Solid Suns</i>...<br/>
</h3> <p>We are a funky, blues-infested rock trio from Las Vegas, Nevada. Formed in the desert heat, we've been playing music together for almost four years now. Through the kindness and generosity of our fans and supporters, we've been able to accomplish some amazing things in these past few years. <br/><br/>Our love for music and the support of people like you gave us the opportunity to record two full-length studio albums and play shows at amazing venues like the House of Blues and Hard Rock Cafe on the world-famous Las Vegas Strip. <br/></p>After recording two albums in two years, we decided to take our time with the third.

<i>Ungodly Hour</i>...<br/>
</h3> <p>A nod to the creative process, Ungodly Hour is our most ambitious project yet. Besides recording costs, we'd also like to raise money to launch a new look and visual direction for the band. This includes a new logo and merchandise for our fans. Here is a breakdown of our fundraising goal:<br/></p> <ul> <li>$5,000 for studio recording costs </li> <li>$650 for new merchandise and logo redesign<br/>
</li> <li>$350 for manufacturing physical copies of the album<br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>How you can help... <br/>
</h3> <p>Without you, this won't happen. We've done our best to set up the incentives more like a pre-order system. You can score yourself digital and physical copies of Ungodly Hour, as well as our first two studio albums. The more you contribute, the more you get and the more it helps us reach our goal. Along with music and merch, we also have some lofty incentives such as private shows and spending a day in Vegas with us.  <br/><br/>Even if you don't have any money to contribute, you can still help. Please consider sharing this campaign and our music with someone you know. <br/><br/>Thank You!<br/><br/>Jon, Jim, and Brian<br/></p>

<div>We are DAYWRECKER. A metal band that is just trying to make a our dream a reality from Myrtle Beach South Carolina. We are comprised of 4 guys and a chick. With many lineup changes I think we finally found the right group.  We are all from all over the United States and influenced from everything from Zappa, Meshuggah, Tool, Slayer, Lamb of God, Candiria to Sepultura. Oh, and Huey Lewis and the News...Can't ever forget them.</div>
<div>We are starting this campaign in order to make this dream happen.  We did a mini tour a month ago and got the taste of what we really want. We did a few shows with Crowbar, Unearth, Black Crown Initiate and Crobot.  We have Coal Chamber, Filter, American Headcharge and Combichrist coming up April 8th in Charlotte N.C. at the Filmore.  We want to be prepared and have our cd done and merchandise.  We are already looking to hit the road in the summertime. We require a vehicle, merchandise, cds and promotions to make this happen.  We are trying to obviously work and save ourselves but the extra expenses with our regular living is slowly killing us.</div>
<div>We have plans to travel to New Orleans the end of March to record our full length cd and shoot a video which obviously costs a pretty penny to travel down there.  We have chosen this route because of the situation it puts it in and as well as recording with a fantastic engineer and producer that have done well known bands. After the recording we travel to Charlotte to play with Coal Chamber.  We are planning in July to tour from S.C. To N.Y. To Ohio and back down to S.C.  We are willing to keep working and touring and getting our music out there as we are all dedicated to do so.</div>

<div>We obviously will have perks available for people that are going to contribute.</div> <p>You can check our Facebook as we post constantly as our updates seem to change for the greater good.</p>

<div>We need funding for the Cd and video shoot and the travel to New orleans.  We need to get a van for the touring we will be doing in the summertime and the weekend warrior mini tours beforehand. We need merchandise for perks and for when we hit the road and to sell on our website.
