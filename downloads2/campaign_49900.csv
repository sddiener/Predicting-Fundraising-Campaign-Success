<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>We Must Grow Tough, But Without Ever Losing Our Tenderness</strong> follows the tumultuous young lives of Leila Khaled and Patricio Argüello Ryan, and the bond that develops during the few days they spent together before their dangerous – and ultimately deadly – mission.</p>
<p>At the tender age of four, Leila Khaled and her family flee Palestine after a series of brutal Zionist massacres on neighboring villages. Growing up in a foreign land, her fierce allegiance to her home country intensifies, and she excels as a soldier with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). She carries out an historic airplane hijacking, and finds herself hailed as an icon for the Palestinian resistance movement. With her face now internationally recognized, she undergoes several plastic surgeries to disguise her identity, and steels herself for the upcoming hijacking of a U.S. bound Israeli aircraft, EL AL flight 219.</p>
<p>On the other side of the world in Nicaragua, American-born Patricio Argüello Ryan revolts against the Somoza dictatorship, speaking out against government corruption and recruiting students to join the Sandinista revolution. Eventually he is expelled from the country he loves. With the goal of one day returning home, he negotiates weapons, supplies and military training from the PFLP, committing in exchange Nicaraguan participation in the PFLP’s upcoming mission.</p>
<p>Leila and Pat meet in Frankfurt under assumed names, where they and several other members of their team conspire to carry out three simultaneous hijackings in a week’s time. Meanwhile, a seasoned Israeli Mossad agent is tasked with hunting down Leila to thwart her subterfuge.</p>
<p>It is during these few nights that Leila's and Pat’s kinship blossoms. They understand each other’s suffering, the pain behind the passion, and the humanity that drives them both forward. The final mission is, in a word, explosive, and has gone down in history as one of the most dramatic political missions of all time.</p>
<p>Part action, part drama, part biography and part historical exploration, <strong>We Must Grow Tough, But Without Ever Losing Our Tenderness</strong> is inspired by the true story that will have viewers questioning what they once thought was right, and lingering on a friendship that lasted for just a moment.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The potential impact this story can have on popular opinion is enormous because of its global reach and humanist appeal.</h3>

<p>Samir Salem was raised in a multi-cultural family in a diverse, blue-collar neighborhood in Chicago. This upbringing allowed Samir to form a unique perspective and to identify with a broad range of people, cultures and ideologies.</p>
<p>Samir studied film production at the University of Miami, where his films won multiple awards at national and international festivals. Those films lead to opportunities that prompted Samir to move to Los Angeles, where he produced and directed comedic sketches and webisodes. Samir went on to produce and direct Roshambo Apocalypse. The action-comedy has screened around the world at film festivals, international distribution outlets and has aired on NBC. Samir has also been involved with several documentaries that focus on issues of social injustice.</p>
<p>Samir founded Cinemonger, a motion picture company, which is defined by the blue-collar attitude Samir was raised with. Cinemonger’s mission is to produce inspirational, provocative and impassioned motion pictures for the global marketplace, with the intention of bringing about social change to our world through entertainment.</p>
<p>Besides the international film industry, Samir invests his time in actions that positively effect social justice and is the field coordinator/co-organizer of the North America Nakba Tour.</p>
<p><strong>Samir believes that Leila and Pat are the symbolic bridge between the Arab &amp; Latin worlds, and that he is a physical manifestation of that bridge.</strong></p>
<p>""My father was born in Jerusalem pre-1948 and our family is from Yalo near Ramallah. I've been back home a couple of times and every time I go I visit the site where my grandmother and grandfather's house use to stand. Now it is just the ruins of a once beautiful home. You can still see the stone structure of the house, where the kitchen was, where the rooms were, the courtyard, etc. The cactus that grows has not covered it completely. And in the middle of it all is still a tree that grows the most delicious figs I've ever eaten. Last time I was there me, my dad and the taxi driver ate every single piece of fruit.""</p>
<p>""My mother was born in Bogota, and our family is from El Llano, the plains or savanna east of the Andes mountain range. The lifestyle there used to be the lifestyle of cowboys. Then the corporations and government came to tap the oil underneath the rich and fertile land. Now that the oil is mostly gone, the local economy has also dried up and the cowboy lifestyle is mostly just a thing of the past. It's a region that has been and continues to be exploited. Seeing the corruption and injustices occurring in both of my homelands has been a motivating factor for me in my life and an inspiration for the choices I've made and continue to make.""</p>
<p>""I've been adopted by the friendly and passionate people of Nicaragua. What started as a research mission has turned into a love affair. Nicaragua is another place that is misunderstood. The history is sad and tragic and full of death and violence, but if you look deeper you see it stems from something beautiful: the need to be free, the courage to resist oppression, the desire to live side by side with your family, to grow old together, to enjoy the simple things in life, like good food, the beauty of nature, the company of loved ones, poetry, dance, freedom of expression... The stories of their heroes and martyrs reminded me of the heroes and martyrs of Palestine. I feel at home in Nicaragua.""</p>

<h3>2018 marks the 70th anniversary of the Nakba (aka the Catastrophe).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>With a successful campaign we can release the feature film next year in time to mark the date that 4-year-old Leila Khaled, her family, and 700,000 indigenous Palestinians were massacred and forcibly removed from their homes and their country by Zionist paramilitary groups, which eventually became the Israeli Occupational/""Defense"" Force.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>With $3,000,000 we can make the feature film.</h3>
<p>Our stated goal is $50,000. With that level of financing we can continue to develop the film and produce a short film that will be used as the key tool to secure further financing, attract an A-list lead producer, and attach movie stars for our lead roles.</p>
<p>Film sets, professional equipment, talented cast &amp; crew, art, costumes, props...movies are expensive to make. But it's all worth it when you can touch people with emotional and artistic impressions. Besides the obvious costs, there are big chunks of the budget that must be allocated to transportation, daily meals for the cast &amp; crew, insurance, legal fees, and much more. And did we mention that we have to make it all look like 1970? We need period piece vehicles, sets, decor, costumes, newsreel footage...  For the feature film we have experienced co-producer elements in Germany, where the majority of filming will take place. We will implement the generous German government film grants for co-productions in their country. And we are also in discussions with interested co-producers and production companies in Egypt, France, Palestine, Brazil, and the UK.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494363980/jrs5oaitouegvjj0ssqx.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Obstacles?</h3>
<p>Being a Palestinian director in Hollywood, especially one telling a story of a hijacking, means that the journey is more arduous and complicated then most others with the same aspirations. We're not just telling stories. We're resisting Zionism.</p>
<p>We began introducing <strong>We Must Grow Tough</strong> a couple of years ago to certain actors, producers and production companies. Since then some of those parties I contacted have ignored our project, but have produced a film about a Palestinian led hijacking from 1974 that ended in a Mossad raid killing the Palestinian and German hijackers. This picture will glorify the Israelis and the Mossad, and demonize the Palestinians once again. We've seen it before in the mainstream media with Munich, for example.</p>
<p>Another film is currently being produced about the Mossad's rescue of Ethiopian Jews in 1981. This picture is being directed by a director whose previous work has been on Homeland and Tyrant, which as you may or may not know, doesn't exactly have positive portrayals of Arabs. Ironically, this film stars the actor who plays Captain America in the Marvel series. The connection of Captain America and the Zionist Mossad character is an interesting choice, don't you think?</p>
<h3>My point is that the Zionist movement understands the power of the narrative. They have manipulated it for decades. Help us take control of the narrative. Help us tell the truth.</h3>

Leila Khaled needed to be heard.
 
Patricio Argüello Ryan was compelled to revolt and speak out against dictatorship.
 
The Film
 

 
Short Summary
We Must Grow Tough, But Without Ever Losing Our Tenderness follows the tumultuous young lives of Leila Khaled and Patricio Argüello Ryan, and the bond that develops during the few days they spent together before their dangerous – and ultimately deadly – mission.
At the tender age of four, Leila Khaled and her family flee Palestine after a series of brutal Zionist massacres on neighboring villages. Growing up in a foreign land, her fierce allegiance to her home country intensifies, and she excels as a soldier with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). She carries out an historic airplane hijacking, and finds herself hailed as an icon for the Palestinian resistance movement. With her face now internationally recognized, she undergoes several plastic surgeries to disguise her identity, and steels herself for the upcoming hijacking of a U.S. bound Israeli aircraft, EL AL flight 219.
On the other side of the world in Nicaragua, American-born Patricio Argüello Ryan revolts against the Somoza dictatorship, speaking out against government corruption and recruiting students to join the Sandinista revolution. Eventually he is expelled from the country he loves. With the goal of one day returning home, he negotiates weapons, supplies and military training from the PFLP, committing in exchange Nicaraguan participation in the PFLP’s upcoming mission.
Leila and Pat meet in Frankfurt under assumed names, where they and several other members of their team conspire to carry out three simultaneous hijackings in a week’s time. Meanwhile, a seasoned Israeli Mossad agent is tasked with hunting down Leila to thwart her subterfuge.
It is during these few nights that Leila's and Pat’s kinship blossoms. They understand each other’s suffering, the pain behind the passion, and the humanity that drives them both forward. The final mission is, in a word, explosive, and has gone down in history as one of the most dramatic political missions of all time.
Part action, part drama, part biography and part historical exploration, We Must Grow Tough, But Without Ever Losing Our Tenderness is inspired by the true story that will have viewers questioning what they once thought was right, and lingering on a friendship that lasted for just a moment.
 
The potential impact this story can have on popular opinion is enormous because of its global reach and humanist appeal.

The Director 

Samir Salem was raised in a multi-cultural family in a diverse, blue-collar neighborhood in Chicago. This upbringing allowed Samir to form a unique perspective and to identify with a broad range of people, cultures and ideologies.
Samir studied film production at the University of Miami, where his films won multiple awards at national and international festivals. Those films lead to opportunities that prompted Samir to move to Los Angeles, where he produced and directed comedic sketches and webisodes. Samir went on to produce and direct Roshambo Apocalypse. The action-comedy has screened around the world at film festivals, international distribution outlets and has aired on NBC. Samir has also been involved with several documentaries that focus on issues of social injustice.
Samir founded Cinemonger, a motion picture company, which is defined by the blue-collar attitude Samir was raised with. Cinemonger’s mission is to produce inspirational, provocative and impassioned motion pictures for the global marketplace, with the intention of bringing about social change to our world through entertainment.
Besides the international film industry, Samir invests his time in actions that positively effect social justice and is the field coordinator/co-organizer of the North America Nakba Tour.
Samir believes that Leila and Pat are the symbolic bridge between the Arab & Latin worlds, and that he is a physical manifestation of that bridge.
""My father was born in Jerusalem pre-1948 and our family is from Yalo near Ramallah. I've been back home a couple of times and every time I go I visit the site where my grandmother and grandfather's house use to stand. Now it is just the ruins of a once beautiful home. You can still see the stone structure of the house, where the kitchen was, where the rooms were, the courtyard, etc. The cactus that grows has not covered it completely. And in the middle of it all is still a tree that grows the most delicious figs I've ever eaten. Last time I was there me, my dad and the taxi driver ate every single piece of fruit.""
""My mother was born in Bogota, and our family is from El Llano, the plains or savanna east of the Andes mountain range. The lifestyle there used to be the lifestyle of cowboys. Then the corporations and government came to tap the oil underneath the rich and fertile land. Now that the oil is mostly gone, the local economy has also dried up and the cowboy lifestyle is mostly just a thing of the past. It's a region that has been and continues to be exploited. Seeing the corruption and injustices occurring in both of my homelands has been a motivating factor for me in my life and an inspiration for the choices I've made and continue to make.""
""I've been adopted by the friendly and passionate people of Nicaragua. What started as a research mission has turned into a love affair. Nicaragua is another place that is misunderstood. The history is sad and tragic and full of death and violence, but if you look deeper you see it stems from something beautiful: the need to be free, the courage to resist oppression, the desire to live side by side with your family, to grow old together, to enjoy the simple things in life, like good food, the beauty of nature, the company of loved ones, poetry, dance, freedom of expression... The stories of their heroes and martyrs reminded me of the heroes and martyrs of Palestine. I feel at home in Nicaragua.""
 
Patricio José Argüello Ryan

LAST MESSAGE
 
 


 

 
2018 marks the 70th anniversary of the Nakba (aka the Catastrophe).
 
With a successful campaign we can release the feature film next year in time to mark the date that 4-year-old Leila Khaled, her family, and 700,000 indigenous Palestinians were massacred and forcibly removed from their homes and their country by Zionist paramilitary groups, which eventually became the Israeli Occupational/""Defense"" Force.
 
With $3,000,000 we can make the feature film.
Our stated goal is $50,000. With that level of financing we can continue to develop the film and produce a short film that will be used as the key tool to secure further financing, attract an A-list lead producer, and attach movie stars for our lead roles.
Film sets, professional equipment, talented cast & crew, art, costumes, props...movies are expensive to make. But it's all worth it when you can touch people with emotional and artistic impressions. Besides the obvious costs, there are big chunks of the budget that must be allocated to transportation, daily meals for the cast & crew, insurance, legal fees, and much more. And did we mention that we have to make it all look like 1970? We need period piece vehicles, sets, decor, costumes, newsreel footage...  For the feature film we have experienced co-producer elements in Germany, where the majority of filming will take place. We will implement the generous German government film grants for co-productions in their country. And we are also in discussions with interested co-producers and production companies in Egypt, France, Palestine, Brazil, and the UK.
 

 
Obstacles?
Being a Palestinian director in Hollywood, especially one telling a story of a hijacking, means that the journey is more arduous and complicated then most others with the same aspirations. We're not just telling stories. We're resisting Zionism.
We began introducing We Must Grow Tough a couple of years ago to certain actors, producers and production companies. Since then some of those parties I contacted have ignored our project, but have produced a film about a Palestinian led hijacking from 1974 that ended in a Mossad raid killing the Palestinian and German hijackers. This picture will glorify the Israelis and the Mossad, and demonize the Palestinians once again. We've seen it before in the mainstream media with Munich, for example.
Another film is currently being produced about the Mossad's rescue of Ethiopian Jews in 1981. This picture is being directed by a director whose previous work has been on Homeland and Tyrant, which as you may or may not know, doesn't exactly have positive portrayals of Arabs. Ironically, this film stars the actor who plays Captain America in the Marvel series. The connection of Captain America and the Zionist Mossad character is an interesting choice, don't you think?
My point is that the Zionist movement understands the power of the narrative. They have manipulated it for decades. Help us take control of the narrative. Help us tell the truth.

تواصلنا معها تجاهلت المشروع، وما لبثت أن أنتجت فيلمًا عن اختطاف طائرة عام 1974 لتمجّد عميل موساد إسرائيلي وتشيطن الفلسطينيين وهو تمامًا ما حدث في وسائل الإعلام في حديثها عمّا جرى في ميونخ هناك فيلم آخر يتم إنتاجه حالياً عن انقاذ الموساد ليهود اثيوبيين في 1981 هذه الصورة يتم إنتاجها من قبل منتج عمل مسبقًا على ""هوملاند اند تايرنت""، الذي إن كنتم تعلمون أو لا تعلمون، ينقل صورةسيئة عن العرب والممثل هو نجم فيلم ""كابتن أميركا"". الربط ما بين دور كابتن أميركا وعميل الموساد الصهيوني مثير للاهتمام أليس كذلك؟ ما أقصده أن المعارضة تفهم مدى قوة الحكاية لقد تحكموا بها لعقود ساعدونا لنتحكم بالحكاية ساعدونا لنقول الحقيقة____________________________________________________________________________المخرج  لقد نشأ سمير سالم في عائلة متعددة الثقافات في حي متنوع في ""شيكاغو"". هذه التربية أعطت سمير وجهة نظر فريدة من نوعها وودفعته للتعرّف على أشخاص وثقافات ومذاهب مختلفة. لقد درس سمير الإنتاج في جامعة ميامي، حيث ربحت أفلامه عدّة جوائز في احتفلات عالمية و دولية. هذه الأفلام ذهبت بسمير إلى لوس أنجيلوس، حيث أخرج وإنتج عدّة مسرحيات هزلية. أخرج سمير ""راشامبو أبوكوليبس"" وأنتجه. الفيلم الكوميدي/الأكشن عرض حول العالم في احتفلات للأفلام وتمّ توزيعه عالميًا وبثّ على ""أن بي سي"". واشترك سمير أيضا في عدّة وثائقيات تركز على الظلم الإجتماعي. لقد أسس سمير ""سينيمونجر"". مهمتها إنتاج صور متحركة ملهمة ومثيرة للعواطف بالإضافة إلى عمل الأفلام العالمية، يخصص سمير وقته لنشاطات في العدالة الإجتماعية وهو المنسق ومنظّم المشترك لجولة النكبة في أميركا يؤمن سمير أن ""ليلى"" و ""بات"" هما جسر رمزي بين عالم اللاتنيين والعرب وأنه هو المظهر الحقيقي لهذا الجسر ولد والدي في القدس

es crear conciencia, cambiar de perspectiva, motivar la acción y inspirar el cambio. Tal como lo hizo Leila y Patricio hace 47 años, tenemos la intención de llevar el reconocimiento global a la causa Palestina, la ocupación Israelí y el apoyo de los contribuyentes Estado Unidenses a la agenda Sionista en Palestina.Leila y Patricio encontraron solidaridad no sólo en la opresión, sino más importante en la resistencia. Leila Khaled necesitaba ser oída. Patricio Argüello Ryan se vio obligado a rebelarse y hablar en contra de la dictadura. 2018 marca el 70 aniversario de la Nakba (la catástrofe). Con una campaña exitosa podemos lanzar la característica película el próximo año a tiempo para conmemorar la fecha en que Leila Khaled, de 4 años de edad, su familia, y 700,000 Palestinos indígenas fueron masacrados y expulsados forzosamente de sus hogares y su país por grupos paramilitares Sionistas, que eventualmente se convirtieron en la fuerza de trabajo/""defensa"" Israelí. El impacto potencial que esta historia puede tener sobre la opinión popular es enorme por su alcance global y su atractivo humanista. La Película We Must Grow Tough sigue a las tumultuosas y jóvenes vidas de Leila Khaled y Patricio Argüello Ryan, y el vínculo que se desarrolla durante los pocos días que pasaron juntos antes de su misión peligrosa y, en última instancia, letal.A la tierna edad de cuatro años, Leila Khaled y su familia ﬂee Palestina tras una serie de brutales masacres Sonistas en aldeas vecinas. Creciendo en una tierra extranjera, su lealtad ﬁerce a su país natal intensiﬁes, y ella sobresale como soldado con el Frente Popular Para La Liberación de Palestina (FPLP). Ella lleva a cabo un secuestro histórico de aviones, y ella misma aclamada como un icono para el movimiento Palestino de resistencia. Con su cara ahora reconocida internacionalmente, se somete a varias cirugías plásticas para disfrazar su identidad, y se aceros para el próximo secuestro de un avión Israelí con destino a los Estados Unidos, el al vuelo 219.Al otro lado del mundo en Nicaragua, Patricio Argüello Ryan, naciedo en Los Estados Unidos, rebela contra la dictadura de Somoza, hablando en contra de la corrupción del gobierno y reclutando estudiantes para unirse a la revolución Sandinista. Eventualmente es expulsado del país que ama. Con el objetivo de un día de regreso a casa, negocia armas, suministros y entrenamiento militar de la FPLP, comprometiéndose a intercambiar participación nicaragüense en la próxima misión del FPLP.Leila y Pat se reúnen en Frankfurt bajo los nombres asumidos, donde ellos y varios otros miembros de su equipo conspiran para llevar a cabo tres secuestros simultáneos en el tiempo de una semana. Mientras tanto, un agente Israelí entrenado del Mossad tiene la tarea de cazar a Leila para frustrar su subterfugio.Es durante estas pocas noches que la amistad entre Leila y Pat crece. Ellos entienden el sufrimiento de los demás, el dolor detrás de la pasión, y la humanidad que los impulsa a ambos hacia adelante. La misión de fin es, en una palabra, explosiva, y ha pasado a la historia como una de las misiones políticas más dramáticas de todos los tiempos.Acción parcial, parte del drama, parte biografía y parte de la exploración histórica, We Must Grow Tough se inspira en la historia verdadera que tendrá espectadores cuestionando lo que una vez pensó que era correcto, y persistente en una amistad que duró sólo un momento. With $3,000,000 we can make the feature ﬁlm. Nuestra meta indicada es $50.000. Con ese nivel de financiamiento podemos seguir desarrollando el película y producir un película corto que será utilizado como la herramienta clave para asegurar más financiamiento, atraer a un productor de la lista de un líder, y adjuntar estrellas de cine para nuestros roles principales.Sets de peliculas, equipos profesionales, talentosos actores, arte, disfraces, utilería ... las peliculas son caras de hacer. Pero todo vale la pena cuando se puede tocar a la gente con impresiones emocionales y artísticas. Además de los costos obvios, hay grandes porciones del presupuesto que se deben asignar al transporte, comidas diarias para el reparto y la tripulación, seguro, honorarios legales, y mucho más. ¿y mencionamos que tenemos que hacer que todo se vea como 1970? Necesitamos los vehículos del pedazo del período, sistemas, decoración, trajes, metraje del noticiario ...  Para la característica película hemos experimentado los elementos coproductores en Alemania, donde la mayoría de trabajo tendrá lugar. Vamos a implementar el generoso gobierno Alemán película subvenciones para coproducciones en su país. Y también estamos en conversaciones con los coproductores interesados y las empresas de producción en Egipto, Francia, Palestina, Brasil y Inglaterra.  Obstáculos? Ser un director Palestino en Hollywood, especialmente uno contando una historia de un secuestro, significa que el viaje es más arduo y complicado que la mayoría de los demás con las mismas aspiraciones. No sólo estamos contando historias. Estamos resistiendo al Sionismo.Hollywood tiene Sionistas en posiciones para sabotear proyectos como el nuestro.Empezamos a introducir que Debemos Crecer Duro hace un par de años a ciertos actores, productores y empresas de producción. Desde entonces algunas de esas partes que contacté han ignorado nuestro proyecto, pero han producido un película sobre un secuestro Palestino de 1974 que terminó en una incursión del Mossad matando a los secuestradores Palestinos y Alemanes. Esta imagen glorificará a los Israelíes y al Mossad, y demonizará a los Palestinos una vez más. Lo hemos visto antes en los medios principales con Munich, por ejemplo.Otro película se está produciendo actualmente sobre el rescate del Mossad de Judíos Etíopes en 1981. Este cuadro está siendo dirigido por un director cuyo trabajo anterior ha sido en la patria y el tirano, que como usted puede o no sabe, no tiene exactamente representaciones positivas de los Arabes. Irónicamente, este película protagoniza el actor que interpreta al Capitán América en la serie Marvel. La conexión del Capitán América y el carácter Sionista del Mossad es una elección interesante, ¿no crees?Mi punto es que la oposición entiende el poder de la narrativa. Lo han controlado durante décadas. Ayúdenos a tomar el control de la narrativa. Ayúdanos a decir la verdad. El Director Samir Salem fue criado en una familia multicultural en un vecindario diverso y de cuello azul en Chicago. Esta crianza permitió a Samir formar una perspectiva única y identificarse con una amplia gama de personas, culturas y ideologías.Samir estudió la producción de película en la Universidad de Miami, donde su películas ganó múltiples premios en festivales nacionales y internacionales. Ésos películas conducen a las oportunidades que incitaron a Samir para moverse a Los Ángeles, donde él produjo y dirigió los bosquejos y el popular del cómico. Samir se encendió para producir y dirigir el Apocalipsis Roshambo. La comedia de acción ha proyectado en todo el mundo en película festivales, distribuidores internacionales y se ha emitido en la NBC. Samir también ha participado en varios documentales que se centran en temas de injusticia social.Samir fundó Cinemonger, una compañía de production de películas, que es deﬁnada por la actitud del collar Azul con que Samir fue levantado. La misión de Cinemonger es producir imágenes de movimiento inspiradoras, provocadoras y apasionadas para el mercado global, con la intención de traer un cambio social a nuestro mundo a través del entretenimiento.Además de la industria película internacional, Samir invierte su tiempo en acciones que repercuten positivamente en la justicia social y es el organizador de campo de la Gira Nakba de NorteAamérica.Samir cree que Leila y Pat son el puente simbólico entre los mundos Arabe y Latino, y que él es una manifestación física de ese puente.""Mi padre nació en Jerusalén antes de 1948 y nuestra familia es de Yalo cerca de Ramallah. He estado de vuelta a Palestina un par de veces y cada vez que voy visito el sitio donde mis abuelos tuvieron su casa. Ahora es sólo las ruinas de una antigua casa hermosa. Todavía se puede ver la estructura de piedra de la casa, donde estaba la cocina, donde estaban las habitaciones, el patio, etc. El cactus que crece no lo ha cubierto completamente. Y en el medio de todo, todavía existe un árbol, que crece los higos más deliciosos que he comido. La última vez que estuve allí, mi papa, el taxista y yo comimos cada pieza de fruta.""""Mi madre nació en Bogotá, y nuestra familia es del Llano, las sabanas al este de la Cordillera de los Andes. El estilo de vida era de los vaqueros. Pero las corporaciones y el gobierno vinieron a sacar el aceite debajo de la tierra rica y fértil. Ahora que el petróleo se ha ido en su mayoría, la economía local también se ha secado y el estilo de vida de vaquero es en su mayoría sólo una cosa del pasado. Es una región que ha sido y sigue siendo explotada.

<p>‘STONE BY STONE’ is the story of George Sawadago in West Africa and Howard Makofsky in North America and their families, who, since 2003, have worked together, without any government funding, to build the Paradise Orphanage and School, now permanent home to 120 children in Kaya, Burkina Faso, West Africa.</p>
<p>We would like to start by thanking all our supporters in 2016 for your help in our first campaign (please see link) which allowed us to start  filming our documentary project .</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/stone-by-stone-building-the-paradise-orphanage-africa/x/14367346#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/stone-by-sto...</a></p>
<p>We are proud to announce we have completed 8 days of filming in Nova Scotia and Gravenhurst, Canada as well as Long Island, USA.</p>
<p>THE CAMPAIGN:</p>
<p>We are moving into the next phase - filming  in Africa from the last week of September to early October 2017. Our first shoot there will be to meet the Sawadogos and their family, and to capture the first week of school.  The second shoot will be during the winter of 2018 to see how the academic year is progressing and how the construction on the high school property is moving along.</p>
<p>The funds collected during this campaign are needed to cover the travel costs of our crew as well as the equipment rental.  We are planning on donating a digital camera to the orphanage so they can  record themselves and keep their supporters updated via their website - in both still and moving pictures. </p>
<p>As we did in 2016, 25% of this campaign will be directly donated to the Paradise Orphanage.  Last year's donation was used to purchase a new moped that allows new mobility for the orphanage staff.</p>
<p>Once completed and released, the revenues generated by this documentary project will be shared with Kaya’s Kids and the Paradise Orphanage.</p>

<p>- Mike Booth and Jean Legault who organized a benefit concert in August, 2016 in Advocate Harbor for our project and the orphanage.</p>
<p>In November 2016, we had the privilege to interview:</p>

<p>- interview Sean Rice, web designer for Kaya's Kids</p>
<p>- interview Howard Makofsky at the William Floyd High School track where his first idea to get involved in an orphanage came to him</p>

<p>“Perspectives” isn’t just my thesis film; it’s a film about an extremely important social issue that I have been very passionate about for many years.</p>
<p>When I read the powerful letter addressed to Brock Turner, written by the young woman he attacked, I felt so many different emotions at once. Anger, frustration, fear and yet a kind of strength; I was angry that this had happened to her in the first place, frustrated at the way she was treated afterword, fearful at how often sexual assaults occurs, but I also felt the strength that it must have taken to not only write this letter, but to read it to him in court.</p>
<p>Although, sexual assault is a social issue I’ve written about before, after reading this letter, I was compelled to revisit the topic and focus on a different aspect of sexual assault.</p>

<p>Writer/Director, Liv Nelson:</p>
<p>My love of film began at a young age. I would watch a film and suddenly become that character, throwing together a costume with whatever I could get my hands on. That led to me making short films with my close friends and studying film in high school. My film La PANIC represented my school at the Santa Cruz Film Festival and earned me the top talent scholarship at Santa Fe University of Art and Design where I received a Bachelor of Arts in Film within three years.</p>
<p>My time in Santa Fe was largely spent at Garson Studios. During those years, I worked on the television show Longmire, in various capacities. I worked part time in the art department and full time in the property department, as well as performing stunts for the show. The sound stages proved useful for my film projects as well. Two short films I co-wrote, co-produced, co-edited and stared in, Shots and Parallel, won various awards at several different festivals.</p>
<p>I began my graduate studies at the University of Southern California in the Film and Television program in January of 2014. I hope to make films that leave a lasting impression on an audience. Whether it is a psychological thriller that makes people question the person who lives next door, or a drama that highlights an important social issue. I’m currently working on my thesis film “Perspectives,” a story that focuses on sexual assault and the aftermath that comes with it.</p>

<p>Producer, Heliya Alam:</p>
<p>At the age five, all I knew was that I wanted to be in Hollywood. I had no knowledge of what Hollywood consisted of and what filmmaking was like; but what I did know, was that I had to be a prat of this magical world that takes me into a different planet every time I sit in front of a Television screen. Now, as a twenty one year old USC film major,  the childish version of my dream has turned into a possible reality and an educated passion that grows larger everyday. I want to influence others with my films in a positive manner, tell stories that can change one’s perspectives, and help people escape their mundanity.</p>
<p>As the lead producer on this project, I invite you to contribute to this short film that strides to bring awareness toward a very crucial social issue that not only occurs in our country, but also worldwide. Sexual assault is an incident that happens more often than It is talked about. As a team of filmmakers, with the use of our creative brains, Live, Mo, and I, want to do everything in our power to bring this screenplay into life. Your support will empower this change. </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Our team is looking to raise $20,000 dollars to fund this film! This money would go toward all of the production expenses as seen in the chart below:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489796746/wbqsk0amlv8z29decnkm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>As most of the film takes place at a college party, we are going to need a lot of lights, props, a good low light camera, and a lot of extras! We need to sell it and make this party look legit, and then of course, we need to feed everyone!</p>
<p>A huge part of this film is the response to the alleged rape. An essential part of the film takes place at a hospital after the party. Securing a police car, an ambulance and a realistic looking location for the hospital is crucial for our team to really sell this story.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489796849/paplmpbljylvwq8c3sjt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Your contributions would go towards helping us with these production expenses!</p>
<p>We are offering a range of awesome perks when you donate, from exclusive access to the final cut of the film before it premiers, a private Skype meeting with the crew, a signed copy of the shooting script from the cast and crew, to seeing your name in lights on the big screen, and more!</p>
<p>Check out all of the awesome perks we are offering!</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>My hope is that this film creates a discussion around the topic of sexual assault, and poses the question; why does society and the justice system tend to believe the perpetrator? This film is a commentary on the “he said, she said” nature of sexual assault.</p>
<p>Too often we hear a victim was drunk, or was wearing something ""slutty"", or that her actions were that of someone who wanted to have sex. My hope is that this film can challenge that stigma by creating a discussion around the topic of sexual assault, and show that despite how it happened, the aftermath is the same.    </p>
<p>I often weave social issues into the narratives of my films. I have found this to be a successful way to reach people. Film is an interesting and very powerful medium. Whether they are funny or sad, narrative or documentary, films have the ability to move people in ways they otherwise wouldn’t be. One film can influence an individual and it can teach an entire nation. The power of film is undeniable.</p>
<p>Your contribution would go toward helping our team bring this particular story and social issue into the forefront.</p>

<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Anytime you set out to make a film there will be challenges along the way, unforeseen or otherwise. Each day is different and you never know when the location you’ve had locked for over a month is going to cancel on you two days before the shoot, or when the grip truck carrying all of your equipment may be gridlocked due to a march, setting you back several hours.</p>
<p>True examples by the way, but that’s one of reasons I love this industry. Every day is different and exciting; you never know what curveballs are going to be thrown your way. I’m confident that our team is ready to roll with the punches having had real world experience and being a part of USC’s film program.      </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If you’re passionate about this story and this social issue, but can’t donate at the moment, there are other ways you can help us out!</p>
<p>Share this campaign with your family and friends!</p>
<p>Help us get the word out!</p>
<p>Thank you so much for supporting our film. We couldn’t do it without you!</p>

As the lead producer on this project, I invite you to contribute to this short film that strides to bring awareness toward a very crucial social issue that not only occurs in our country, but also worldwide. Sexual assault is an incident that happens more often than It is talked about. As a team of filmmakers, with the use of our creative brains, Live, Mo, and I, want to do everything in our power to bring this screenplay into life. Your support will empower this change. 
What We Need & What You Get
Our team is looking to raise $20,000 dollars to fund this film! This money would go toward all of the production expenses as seen in the chart below:

As most of the film takes place at a college party, we are going to need a lot of lights, props, a good low light camera, and a lot of extras! We need to sell it and make this party look legit, and then of course, we need to feed everyone!
A huge part of this film is the response to the alleged rape. An essential part of the film takes place at a hospital after the party. Securing a police car, an ambulance and a realistic looking location for the hospital is crucial for our team to really sell this story.  

Your contributions would go towards helping us with these production expenses!
We are offering a range of awesome perks when you donate, from exclusive access to the final cut of the film before it premiers, a private Skype meeting with the crew, a signed copy of the shooting script from the cast and crew, to seeing your name in lights on the big screen, and more!
Check out all of the awesome perks we are offering!
The Impact
My hope is that this film creates a discussion around the topic of sexual assault, and poses the question; why does society and the justice system tend to believe the perpetrator? This film is a commentary on the “he said, she said” nature of sexual assault.
Too often we hear a victim was drunk, or was wearing something ""slutty"", or that her actions were that of someone who wanted to have sex. My hope is that this film can challenge that stigma by creating a discussion around the topic of sexual assault, and show that despite how it happened, the aftermath is the same.    
I often weave social issues into the narratives of my films. I have found this to be a successful way to reach people. Film is an interesting and very powerful medium. Whether they are funny or sad, narrative or documentary, films have the ability to move people in ways they otherwise wouldn’t be. One film can influence an individual and it can teach an entire nation. The power of film is undeniable.
Your contribution would go toward helping our team bring this particular story and social issue into the forefront.

Risks & Challenges
Anytime you set out to make a film there will be challenges along the way, unforeseen or otherwise. Each day is different and you never know when the location you’ve had locked for over a month is going to cancel on you two days before the shoot, or when the grip truck carrying all of your equipment may be gridlocked due to a march, setting you back several hours.
True examples by the way, but that’s one of reasons I love this industry. Every day is different and exciting; you never know what curveballs are going to be thrown your way. I’m confident that our team is ready to roll with the punches having had real world experience and being a part of USC’s film program.      
Other Ways You Can Help

This story was inspired by the relationship I have with my dad and the fear I experienced growing up of losing that relationship. A psychological drama short film, ""Blueberry Shadows"" displays the trauma Jack faces after losing his seven-year-old daughter, Bella. Five years after losing Bella, Jack embarks on a journey to the place he and Bella were last together. Throughout his journey, he is haunted by his memories of Bella, which he begins to confuse with his reality.</p><p>Many people are unaware that grief hallucinations are actually quite common. In many cases, these hallucinations are provoked by leftover feelings of guilt. Society tends to see these people as becoming schizophrenic rather than grieving. Due to this misconception, discussing hallucinatory experiences has become taboo. This story explores the reality of the haunted mind during the struggle for acceptance.</p><h2>About this project</h2><p>Our film will be produced through the University of Wisconsin-Madison Communication Arts department. This is a rare opportunity for students to receive hands-on experience in narrative filmmaking while using professional camera equipment. Some of the equipment we will be using include:</p><ul>

<li>Arri Softbank lighting kits, Arri M18s, and Joker Bugs</li>

This story was inspired by the relationship I have with my dad and the fear I experienced growing up of losing that relationship. A psychological drama short film, ""Blueberry Shadows"" displays the trauma Jack faces after losing his seven-year-old daughter, Bella. Five years after losing Bella, Jack embarks on a journey to the place he and Bella were last together. Throughout his journey, he is haunted by his memories of Bella, which he begins to confuse with his reality.Many people are unaware that grief hallucinations are actually quite common. In many cases, these hallucinations are provoked by leftover feelings of guilt. Society tends to see these people as becoming schizophrenic rather than grieving. Due to this misconception, discussing hallucinatory experiences has become taboo. This story explores the reality of the haunted mind during the struggle for acceptance.About this projectOur film will be produced through the University of Wisconsin-Madison Communication Arts department. This is a rare opportunity for students to receive hands-on experience in narrative filmmaking while using professional camera equipment. Some of the equipment we will be using include:
Canon C500 with a Zeiss lens kit
Arri Softbank lighting kits, Arri M18s, and Joker Bugs
Sennheiser MKH 416, 702T Recorder, and 302 Mixer

innovative on-line role game with elements of shooter and other styles, including educational elements. The design philosophy provides different players with the chance to play together in our world. The project will support possible shift of the user’s interest during the game, provide both convenient mechanisms of such shift and possibility of different types of users’ coexistence in a single space. Game environment will hardly compel or limit them.The company’s project is a mass on-line game with educational elements. The communicative background of the project is virtual reality that represents different territories.All actions of the game take place in the real time three dimension spaces, except for some actions held in specific interfaces, such as economic aspects. The logic of the game environment is successively built by means of property factors and principles, revealed by the project originators, such as capital, money, law, power, private property, etc., that characterize modern world order. The environment, constructed in such a way, will encourage different activities in the form they exist in reality, stimulating working with complex institutional objects.The game is basically    RPG one, with elements of 3D shooter and the main idea of technocracy (science fiction). MMORPG/MMOFPS.
3D – shooter (the basis is shooter with partial solo game);
Tactical shooter (the basis is team actions);
Stealth action (avoiding of possible hostile contact);
Economy (real economy emulation. Elements of MMORTS);
Adventure (quests, based on the game plot;
Specific quests;
Role play – RPG (development of the personage’s skills, elements of MMORPG).
The company plans to use the hybrid business-model of service monetization with an accent upon the free-to-play component.Competitiveness of the developed game is caused by the following factors:
the game represents a new trend in the game industry.  Essentially, it is birth of a new game style.

When Black narratives do exist their stories are often oversimplified and one-dimensional, misrepresenting Black experiences, or worse, perpetuating harmful stereotypes about the Black community.</p><p>Our film, <i>Flowers</i>, is meant to combat this, by presenting a narrative not often seen in the media; <i>Flowers</i> is a story that represents an authentic day in the life of four black San Diego teens. Since the film is based off the experience of  Writer/Director Nick Earl, it presents the audience with appropriate portrayals of Black San Diego teens, which Nick hopes can help the audience humanize and empathize with these three-dimensional characters and force them to realize that their lives, and representation, matter.</p><h3>The Team Behind It</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494133084/wzhzir6my2pwr0tvbcvc.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>Nicholas Earl </strong>- <strong>Writer/Director</strong></p><p>My name is Nicholas Earl. I was born in Flint, Michigan and have been living in San Diego, California for the past 7 years. Inspired by my love for animation, I’m currently studying Cinema and Media Studies with a minor in Screenwriting at the University of Southern California’s School of Cinematic Arts (SCA), where I’ve been introduced and exposed to the world of live-action filmmaking. After aspiring to be an animator for so long, my experiences at SCA has inspired me explore my newfound love and respect for storytelling through live action filmmaking. Flowers is only the beginning of a long list of stories I wish to tell, but, nonetheless, it is one that I feel I need to tell first. The concept for Flowers was inspired by my teenage experiences growing up in San Diego. With this film, I explore universal life struggles such as dating and young love. However, most importantly, I do so by telling the overlooked story of  minorities living within a majority white community. I want to give a new perspective both culturally and cinematically to San Diego by telling my story. As many of you know, the film and television industries have historically overlooked, stereotyped and/or silenced minority voices, especially those of the black community.

When Black narratives do exist their stories are often oversimplified and one-dimensional, misrepresenting Black experiences, or worse, perpetuating harmful stereotypes about the Black community.Our film, Flowers, is meant to combat this, by presenting a narrative not often seen in the media; Flowers is a story that represents an authentic day in the life of four black San Diego teens. Since the film is based off the experience of  Writer/Director Nick Earl, it presents the audience with appropriate portrayals of Black San Diego teens, which Nick hopes can help the audience humanize and empathize with these three-dimensional characters and force them to realize that their lives, and representation, matter.The Team Behind ItNicholas Earl - Writer/DirectorMy name is Nicholas Earl. I was born in Flint, Michigan and have been living in San Diego, California for the past 7 years. Inspired by my love for animation, I’m currently studying Cinema and Media Studies with a minor in Screenwriting at the University of Southern California’s School of Cinematic Arts (SCA), where I’ve been introduced and exposed to the world of live-action filmmaking. After aspiring to be an animator for so long, my experiences at SCA has inspired me explore my newfound love and respect for storytelling through live action filmmaking. Flowers is only the beginning of a long list of stories I wish to tell, but, nonetheless, it is one that I feel I need to tell first. The concept for Flowers was inspired by my teenage experiences growing up in San Diego. With this film, I explore universal life struggles such as dating and young love. However, most importantly, I do so by telling the overlooked story of  minorities living within a majority white community. I want to give a new perspective both culturally and cinematically to San Diego by telling my story. As many of you know, the film and television industries have historically overlooked, stereotyped and/or silenced minority voices, especially those of the black community. And stepping outside of San Diego community to come to USC only emphasized how belittled and forgotten about the black community was in the city of San Diego- associating it only with the ritzy areas of La Jolla or Torrey Pines. My goal with this film is to focus on authentic storytelling, to step into a day in the life of black kids in San Diego as they face struggles we can all empathize with: dating in the 21st century. With this film, I want to challenge cultural expectations and bring black people to the forefront, not only to represent our community but also to humanize it for other communities.Bringing a film to life will always be a grueling task, but that’s why I’ve assembled such a talented team to help bring my vision to fruition. Lauren Foley- ProducerBorn and raised in Pasadena, California, Lauren Foley graduated from Westridge School for Girls in 2015 and enrolled at the University of Southern California, where she is currently a Sophomore.

He's never lived a normal life and now in his early 20s he awaits for his death, expected to come within 3 months. With not having done much in his life he is as unprepared for death as anybody can be.Mars still manages to grasp some comfort in his activities, but it is not until he meets a special girl, that his fate starts to change.  About the Crew: Producer/Writer/Director Gerardo J. De Sousa is a Venezuelan independent film director, screenwriter, producer, cinematographer, editor, and actor. His work covers a wide variety of genres and is characterized by the themes on the battles of truth, nature and humanity often depicted in unrealistic worlds such as the eccentric world of Care Package and the dream-like visual and narrative style of the world of Kukla. His most recent films include: Goldfish (Producer and Cinematographer); Nightcapes (Producer, Co-Director and Cinematographer); Kukla (Producer, Director, Writer, Editor)  Most of his films were produced in South Florida under Blue Nebula Pictures which him and Film Director Scott Alexander Naar lead. Gerardo is now living in Dallas, Texas where he co-produced and co-directed Cassie Marin’s music video for her single “Light” and is now working on his next short film ""Life On Mars"" which is expected to be released on December 2017.Actress (Tierra) / ComposerCassie Marin is a vocalist, multi instrumentalist, producer, film composer and actress.

<h3>What is Flop?</h3>
<p>Flop is the story about a young man named Kyle whose<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> overactive imagination has kept him sidelined in his own love life for as long as his best friend Shawn can remember. With a big push from Shawn, Kyle's finally going to get out of his head and make a move. Oh by the way, they're puppeteers for a children's TV show who exclusively control two rapping puppets named Flip (Shawn) and Flop (Kyle). Also, Kyle's latest crush is the new puppet-maker, Marissa.</span></p>
<p>The script for Flop won 2nd place at Cinequest earlier this year (<a href=""https://www.cinequest.org/screenwriting-2017-award-winners-and-finalists"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.cinequest.org/screenwriting-2017-aw...</a>), and we believe with proper financing we can get the finished product into Cinequest and other prominent film festivals.</p>
<p>The ""professionals"" said that this movie would cost $35,000 to make, which is hella expensive for a short film. I'm here to tell you that I have a lot of talented friends and we're pretty damn sure we can make a quality flick for $10,000. </p>
<h3><strong>About the Team</strong></h3>
<p>Writer/director Nick Coleman and his Director of Photography, Joshua Parrera, have made almost 30 short films together. And most of the cast and crew have worked with them either on a movie, or on stage at the Sacramento Comedy Spot where they do improv and sketch comedy together. </p>
<p>Which means everyone from craft services to the lead role has had their comedic talents battle-tested by live audiences. They're all talented artists and they don't want their name on some garbage. So even though the director has the ice cold stare of a Terminator, none of his friends are scared of him like he wishes and they will definitely yell something at him, like ""no, you don't need that f***ing dolly shot right there, dude!""</p>

We'll also film your wedding (this is something we've actually done a bunch, so we'll look/act professional, and not get too drunk). </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a filmmaker. I would grab my parent's giant VHS camcorder, gather the neighborhood kids together, and make such unfinished classics as Space Cons and Underwater Massacre. </p>
<p>The making of movies fell to the wayside as I got distracted first by puberty, then by joining the Army, then by a string of random jobs as I hopped from town to town, looking to make right what once went wrong. </p>
<p>Then one day I stumbled into the Sacramento Comedy Spot. I started doing improv and tried out stand-up, but it was the writing of sketch comedy and seeing people act out my words on stage that really drew me in. I soon had my own monthly sketch comedy show, where I met my Director of Photography, Josh, and several other collaborators who are still with me today.</p>
<p>I wanted our sketch show to stand out from the others, so I decided we'd put video sketches in between each live sketch. This got us going on churning out funny videos on a deadline. It also gave us the feedback of a live audience, rather than just sitting around hoping people are watching it on YouTube.</p>
<p>Fast forward to last year when we made our first narrative short film for a festival. Happy Accidents was made in a few weeks on a zero dollar budget and it won Producer's Choice and Best Supporting Actor (Jesse Jones). It also played really well to a packed house and it made me realize that I can write a good script and that I can make a good movie.</p>
<p>I believe Flop can be a great movie that will showcase, not just my talent, but the talent of everyone on board. I think it will take us to the next level and allow us to make bigger and better things. This isn't a hobby for me, it's what I need to do. It's the only thing I'm good at. I just need you to believe in me and my team then we'll take it from there. </p>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We're filming a 20-minute short film! I believe in the material, but 20 minutes could turn off some festivals that are looking for shorter content in order to program more shorts. But Flop is exactly as long as it needs to be and I think that if we have the cash to back the vision, audiences will wish it were 20 minutes longer.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Times might be tough for you and you just can't contribute financially. But what you can do for us is share this with people who might be interested, direct message it to them, cold call your relatives, possibly knock over a lemonade stand. However you help us get money, we won't judge.</p>
<h3><strong>If we raise more than our goal...</strong></h3>
<p>... that money will be divided amongst those who worked for free on the film.</p>

The Impact
As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a filmmaker. I would grab my parent's giant VHS camcorder, gather the neighborhood kids together, and make such unfinished classics as Space Cons and Underwater Massacre. 
The making of movies fell to the wayside as I got distracted first by puberty, then by joining the Army, then by a string of random jobs as I hopped from town to town, looking to make right what once went wrong. 
Then one day I stumbled into the Sacramento Comedy Spot. I started doing improv and tried out stand-up, but it was the writing of sketch comedy and seeing people act out my words on stage that really drew me in. I soon had my own monthly sketch comedy show, where I met my Director of Photography, Josh, and several other collaborators who are still with me today.
I wanted our sketch show to stand out from the others, so I decided we'd put video sketches in between each live sketch. This got us going on churning out funny videos on a deadline. It also gave us the feedback of a live audience, rather than just sitting around hoping people are watching it on YouTube.
Fast forward to last year when we made our first narrative short film for a festival. Happy Accidents was made in a few weeks on a zero dollar budget and it won Producer's Choice and Best Supporting Actor (Jesse Jones). It also played really well to a packed house and it made me realize that I can write a good script and that I can make a good movie.
I believe Flop can be a great movie that will showcase, not just my talent, but the talent of everyone on board. I think it will take us to the next level and allow us to make bigger and better things. This isn't a hobby for me, it's what I need to do. It's the only thing I'm good at. I just need you to believe in me and my team then we'll take it from there. 
CUE ""I Believe I Can Fly"" by R. Kelly

Risks & Challenges
We're filming a 20-minute short film! I believe in the material, but 20 minutes could turn off some festivals that are looking for shorter content in order to program more shorts. But Flop is exactly as long as it needs to be and I think that if we have the cash to back the vision, audiences will wish it were 20 minutes longer.

Other Ways You Can Help
Times might be tough for you and you just can't contribute financially. But what you can do for us is share this with people who might be interested, direct message it to them, cold call your relatives, possibly knock over a lemonade stand. However you help us get money, we won't judge.
If we raise more than our goal...
... that money will be divided amongst those who worked for free on the film.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>STORY SYNOPSIS</strong></p>
<p>Marla is a night cleaner at a community college. Her only “friend” is a nighttime radio DJ who offers odd, existential advice. Marla is content but lonely, and she wonders why she’s alive at all. She starts having strange visions around the same time that she finds a homeless man lurking around the college. When she discovers that the man is living in the storage closet and is deliriously ill, she attempts to nurse him back to health. Through the almost otherworldly relationship that forms between them, Marla learns an important lesson: life persists so that we can be useful to other people, so that the voice of humanity can be heard through each of us in all its mysterious forms.</p>

<h3>I'M PUTTING IT ON THE LINE! TOXIC TUTU NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT!!</h3>
<p>It's been almost 4 years since we started this crazy fan based film. <br/>""Toxic Tutu"" The Almost True Story Of Whatever Became Of The Toxic Avenger's Melvin The Mop Boy Mark Torgl. Most of you guys, fans, friends, and family have helped us make it happen.  Toxic Tutu is steps from the finish line.</p>
<p>Now comes the fun part, 1: Mastering the movie in multiple formats for screenings be it theatrical, streaming, dvd's etc. 2: A Final Audio Mix will make this baby sing. 3: Getting the film into film festivals and attending the festivals whenever we can afford to travel, and 4: Marketing, Marketing, Marketing. 5: Finding distributors in the U.S. and Foreign to market and put the film out there for the public to see. This all takes money, and we are tapped out. What else is new. With your help Toxic Tutu will Live forever.</p>
<p>Toxic Tutu is scheduled for it's grand premier March 25th at The Mad Monster Party Carolinas! This is the convention that started it all and we are pleased to have our opening screening here.</p>
<p>The $10,000, we are attempting to raise will be our final fund raising campaign  and will finally allow us to put Toxic Tutu out to the world.</p>
<p>We are offering some cool perks including signed posters, dvds, and publicity stills. But we think the best perk for your contribution is knowing you were responsible for making Toxic Tutu a reality.</p>
<p>We know a lot of our fans are as poor as we are, so if nothing else help us get the word out about this campaign to everyone you know who supports Indie Film, is a Troma/Toxic Avenger fan, or are just really cool people.  We urge everyone to share the Indiegogo share tools!</p>

It's been almost 4 years since we started this crazy fan based film. ""Toxic Tutu"" The Almost True Story Of Whatever Became Of The Toxic Avenger's Melvin The Mop Boy Mark Torgl. Most of you guys, fans, friends, and family have helped us make it happen.  Toxic Tutu is steps from the finish line.
Now comes the fun part, 1: Mastering the movie in multiple formats for screenings be it theatrical, streaming, dvd's etc. 2: A Final Audio Mix will make this baby sing. 3: Getting the film into film festivals and attending the festivals whenever we can afford to travel, and 4: Marketing, Marketing, Marketing. 5: Finding distributors in the U.S. and Foreign to market and put the film out there for the public to see. This all takes money, and we are tapped out. What else is new. With your help Toxic Tutu will Live forever.
Toxic Tutu is scheduled for it's grand premier March 25th at The Mad Monster Party Carolinas! This is the convention that started it all and we are pleased to have our opening screening here.
The $10,000, we are attempting to raise will be our final fund raising campaign  and will finally allow us to put Toxic Tutu out to the world.
We are offering some cool perks including signed posters, dvds, and publicity stills. But we think the best perk for your contribution is knowing you were responsible for making Toxic Tutu a reality.
We know a lot of our fans are as poor as we are, so if nothing else help us get the word out about this campaign to everyone you know who supports Indie Film, is a Troma/Toxic Avenger fan, or are just really cool people.  We urge everyone to share the Indiegogo share tools!",2.0,0,"7 Campaigns

<p><i><strong>When a quirky old Japanese lady is given a pair of healing hands... </strong></i></p>
<p>This is a dark comedy/drama set on the brim of the East River, New York, where Keiko Jones, a peculiar Japanese lady, lives out her mundane routine life of chair yoga and Japanese home cooking. One day the ability to heal is bequeathed upon her hands. Being less than nurturing in nature, Keiko does not find this a blessing, however the friendship with a sick little boy changes everything. The boy reminds Keiko of her son Kai, the one person who she ever cared about and who has recently exited her life forever. Through attempting to heal the boy using her newfound powers, Keiko tries to redeem her own past. However, things never go as planned...</p>
<h3 align=""left""><strong><i>Budget</i></strong></h3>
<p align=""left"">The process of filmmaking is a hard and expensive labour of love. With the help of NYU's department in film, we are able to have access to our principle camera and lighting equipment. However, additional gear, transportation fees, payment of crew, meals, lodging as well as may other expenses are also required, and this is where your support becomes crucial.</p>
<p align=""left"">Our overall budget is $30,000 but we plan on raising $15,000 on Indiegogo. Here is a breakdown of how we plan to use our fundraising money:</p>
<p align=""left""><i>Additional gear: $2,000<br/>Production design: $10,000<br/>Transportation: $4,000<br/>Crew: $6,000<br/>Locations: $3,000<br/>Other key expenses: $5,000</i></p>
<h3><i><strong>Project Timeline </strong></i></h3>
<p>Pre-production, Casting: October, 2016-January, 2017 <br/>Principle Photography: Jan.12-Jan.23, 2017 <br/>Post-Production, Sound and Color Correction: February-April, 2017 <br/>Additional Shooting: March, 2017 <br/>Sending out Perks to Backers: April, 2017</p>
<p><i><strong>Looking Forward: The Feature Version </strong></i></p>
<p>As stated earlier, this is only a taste of Keiko in her original form. It has become a new trend for independent feature films to start off as short films. The short form gives investors a taste of how the feature may feel like before committing to investing in it and may reduce their risks in predicting success. This short film is particularly advantageous for this purpose since it is structured as a long short with a major story arc that enables investors to better foresee not only the mood but also the story arc of the feature.  </p>

<p>I knew I needed a strong female lead in order to pull off the film's world and when a series of coincidences lead me to Sakurako, I knew I had found the right person. </p>
<p>Sakurako was born and raised in Japan. She moved to the United States 27 years ago for an MA in communications at NYU. She has been many things in her life, including a Japanese news broadcaster for twenty years, a banker, and full time mom.

In 2014 she wrote and performed a one woman show <strong><i>""本当の私宣言"" (Declaration of Authentic Me) </i></strong>that has played in New York, Tokyo, Kobe, and Okayama. Sakurako is also involved in Japanese cultural arts and events, and improv/spiritual musical gatherings for self-healing in New York. This project is her film debut.</p>

<h3> Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Destiny is a valuable tool to bring back the excitement, passion and the tradition of classic westerns. Those who contribute will be part of historic return of an American Tradition.</p>
<p>I remember sitting with my Dad watching westerns on a Saturday afternoon. Later going to the Theatre seeing John Wayne on the large screen. The excitement as I watch the old west come alive.</p>
<h3> Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our biggest challenge is distribution in specific areas. Such as Theatrical Release and Streaming on the internet (Net Flex, YouTube, Etc.).</p>
<p>Our alternative plan is to start our own webpage with streaming as well as making available DVDs and Downloads through Amazon.  In any situation the public world wide will see Destiny and recognize those who made it possible, such as you.  </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>
<p>Get the word out and make some noise about the campaign to you friends and family. Use social media and other communication tools you have. There are tools to use here on Indiegogo under share tools.</p>

Our perks include but not limited to a complete book of production and behind scenes photos as well as screen credits.
Limited amount of opportunities to be an extra in Destiny and visit the production set and meet the cast.
In the case we don't reach our goal we will proceed as far as funding allows and attempt to obtain more investors and start a new campaign.
Currently will have receive $16,000 from investors which was use to shoot 16 pages of the script. 
 Impact

Destiny is a valuable tool to bring back the excitement, passion and the tradition of classic westerns. Those who contribute will be part of historic return of an American Tradition.
I remember sitting with my Dad watching westerns on a Saturday afternoon. Later going to the Theatre seeing John Wayne on the large screen. The excitement as I watch the old west come alive.
 Risks & Challenges
Our biggest challenge is distribution in specific areas. Such as Theatrical Release and Streaming on the internet (Net Flex, YouTube, Etc.).
Our alternative plan is to start our own webpage with streaming as well as making available DVDs and Downloads through Amazon.  In any situation the public world wide will see Destiny and recognize those who made it possible, such as you.

Fairbanks.  I have been working in video since 1993 and have won numerous awards at film festivals, including the Audience Choice award at the Newburyport Documentary Film Festival.  My films have been distributed on Amazon.com and Netflix as well as broadcast nationally.</p><p>I have dreamed of owning a DeLorean for a long time.  In the summer of 2016 that dream finally became a reality--with one serious drawback...  As you might imagine, there are few DeLoreans for sale in Alaska, so I had to buy mine in the Lower 48.  To get it back home I'll have to drive it 3700 miles back to Fairbanks, Alaska up the dangerous Alaska-Canada (Alcan) highway.   My plan is to film the entire process, from buying the car, meeting people along the way, and arriving (I hope…) safely back in Fairbanks with the DeLorean.</p><p>Completing this film is important to me because I believe in pursuing dreams.  When my father passed away in 2009 at 60-years-old, I decided I couldn’t wait until I retired to chase my dreams because I may not end up having that luxury.  However this film is not just about a road trip.  It’s also about how your life changes when you finally get something big you’ve dreamed about for a long time, how it affects your friends, and the importance of following your dreams.</p><p>Your support will help me do this film right by providing the funds necessary for music and image licensing, graphic design, film festival entry fees, publicity, and other filmmaking and distribution expenses.  With your help we can make this film the way it should be made with the necessary elements for a really polished and professional documentary film.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><p>This project is scalable, so we can do more with more funding and still complete the film if we don’t reach our goal.  Film festivals alone, for example, generally cost between $25 and $50 each to enter—whether or not your film actually gets accepted.  It’s not uncommon for filmmakers to enter dozens of film festivals in an effort to build publicity, contacts, and a reputation for their film.  That adds up to a lot of money.</p><p>If I do not reach my full goal, I will just enter less film festivals, use less (or no) licensed music, do graphic design myself, etc.  The film will still be completed, but it may not have the same polish or reach as large an audience as it could if it were fully funded.</p><p><strong>Perks for Contributing:</strong></p><p>$5-$39:  Get your name in the film credits!</p><p>$40-$79: All of the above and a signed

pursue our wildest dreams or are too afraid to try.  “Back to Alaska: The DeLorean Road Trip Movie” will follow one regular guy as he dives in and pursues his dream despite his fears and the skepticism of those around him.  What is that like and is it worth it?  This film will encourage some people to finally chase their own dreams while possibly confirming for others that dreams are best left as just dreams.</p><p>When you support this project you are not just funding a documentary, you’ll also casting your vote for the dreamers.  You are saying you believe we still live in a world

<p>Music &amp; Story</p>
<p>Punk poetics in the broadest sense shall be the <i>Leitmotiv</i> running through the whole opera, featuring all the unexpected and surprising references from music, poetry and art history. The narration shall be poetic and associative, the story shall be told in impressions, moods, images and songs, leaving free space for abstraction, daydreaming and free association. The piece shall enact one main character; a dreamer, an artist, a poet, a troubadour, a punk or the spectator himself, wandering through centuries, daydreaming, and experiencing mystic adventures, love, transience, death, misfortune and wars. During this journey, the main character will encounter various fabulous figures, singing, poetizing, prophesizing, outlining her or his destiny (it is purposely not clear if the main character is a man or a woman). All the songs and texts, selected for the opera, shall have in common themes of: the imminent Apocalypse, heresy, outcry and revolt against the inevitability of decay and death, the elusiveness of life, the political iniquity, the imminence of love and violence, the mediaeval <i>memento mori</i> and <i>vanitas</i>.  </p>
<p>The opera shall be realized as a filmed performance, each act will be a life performance played and recorded in a black box – a theatre or a concert stage. The characters shall interact with each other on three screens – like ghosts or holograms. An open working process, based on encounter and exchange with the invited artists, shall underlie the opera.</p>
<p>„Orlando“ (1928) by Virginia Wolf or „Opera Curiosa“ (1979) by Marianne Sägebrecht served me as prototypes or possible inspirations.</p>

<p>About me</p>
<p>My name is Aneta and I am an experimental film maker who travels through time and space using the medium of film and working on themes of alchemy and rebellion as self-finding process. I have been developing the idea of a Punk Opera for three years within the framework of my artistic PhD at the University of Arts, Berlin and Le Fresnoy in Tourcoing, France, collecting forgotten songs, conversation pieces, pictures, punk artefacts and film fragments. Through the creation of a visual and musical installation, I would like to test the relevancy of my theories and ideas about punk poetics as images on stage. I am interested in challenging the existing norms of performing knowledge. </p>
<p>I was born in Warsaw, Poland. I studied art history at the University Paris 4 Sorbonne, where I explored questions of transmediality in the arts, the uncanny in media and artistic exchanges between the three countries: France, Germany and Poland. At present I live and work in Berlin as an experimental filmmaker, curator, art historian, artist-supporter, and world traveler. </p>
<p>In december 2016 I was able to realize first shootings for the Punk Opera, featuring great artists such as an internationally renowned soprano Simone Kermes and her music ensemble, as well as Mona Mur - the punk and chanson singer, as well as an underground diva, together with En Esch- industrial rock legend, known from industrial bands KMFDM, Slick Idiot and Pigface, Yoriko Maeno, a butoh dancer from Tokyo and Meritxell Campos Olive, an experimental dancer from Barcelona.</p>
<p>The images as well as the video you can see on this page are the result of these first shootings. </p>
<p>In order to accomplish the opera however, I still have some shootings ahead. In February and March, I plan to film and record with: Rieko Okuda - a first class pianist from Osaka who will play experimental fugues on piano, Takushi Minagawa - a japanese countertenor, Zazie de Paris - a famous transgender chanson singer from Paris, Margita Haberland, an artist and musician who will realize a life performance accompanied by an improvisation on electric violin, Dieter Meier, an artist and a dandy, who will perform his beautiful lullaby ""Schueffele"". I also plan working on the composition of the whole opus with FM Einheit in his studio in Bayern, which means the selection of pieces, writing of the score, music producing, mixing and mastering. At the end and with your support, we will have an explosive mixture bringing together some historical figures from the underground scene of punk and from classical opera, put together in an innovative format of a video installation, to be presented in theatres, galeries and off-spaces all over the world and available also on CD and DVD. I need your support to accomplish this, so here is the plan I propose:   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Goal #1 - 7,500 €</p>
<p>Even though this seems like a small number, our initial goal to start is 7,500 €. This will put our campaign ""in-demand"", and enable us to begin rehearsals, shooting and recording with artists with basic equipment. We want to get started NOW, so please help us reach this goal quickly. At this point we will be able to start giving you sneak-peeks of ""on set"" activity with videos and photos directly from the set.</p>
<p>Goal #2 - 15,000 €</p>
<p>At the 15,000 € level we will be able to gather a professional crew and to hire a costume designer, a make up artist, as well as a camera operator, lighting- and sound technicians. We will also address artists we have in mind (see above), and are currently ""in talks"" with. All we need is the budget to make legitimate offers to them and they will be on-board right away.</p>
<p>Goal #3 - 30,000 €</p>
<p>This puts us into FULL PRODUCTION MODE. Once we reach 30,000 €, we will be in full-swing and can start producing the vast majority of the installation, including DVD and CD.</p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<p>Some of you may not be able to contribute just yet, but are planning to soon. Until then, here are some things you can do right now to help...</p>
<p>Share your passion for this campaign by sharing it through social media and email. EVERY single time you share or post something about Punk Opera, this project makes progress. </p>

<p><strong><u>Why This Film? Why Indiegogo?</u></strong></p>
<p>Chariot is a pitch black ensemble comedy from Wales, with a fabulous cast. It will be filmed documentary-style with a small crew, and the help of the local community in Swansea, UK. </p>
<p>The film is a response to the rise of the ""Winner Takes All"" culture over the last 30 years. It explores this by looking at the actions of one man, and his effect on a small community in post-Brexit UK. </p>
<p>Due to the thriving film industry in Wales, writer/director Rob Surman was able to write and cast this project around some awesome acting talent, with faces recognisable both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>In order to maintain the integrity of the film, and ensure it loses none of its ""Special Sauce"", we need to maintain control of it. Therefore, we are not seeking funds from government or corporate sources, and are appealing directly to you. </p>
<p>We can't do this without you, our CHARIOTEERS!</p>

</div></div>","Why This Film? Why Indiegogo?
Chariot is a pitch black ensemble comedy from Wales, with a fabulous cast. It will be filmed documentary-style with a small crew, and the help of the local community in Swansea, UK. 
The film is a response to the rise of the ""Winner Takes All"" culture over the last 30 years. It explores this by looking at the actions of one man, and his effect on a small community in post-Brexit UK. 
Due to the thriving film industry in Wales, writer/director Rob Surman was able to write and cast this project around some awesome acting talent, with faces recognisable both sides of the Atlantic.
In order to maintain the integrity of the film, and ensure it loses none of its ""Special Sauce"", we need to maintain control of it. Therefore, we are not seeking funds from government or corporate sources, and are appealing directly to you. 
We can't do this without you, our CHARIOTEERS!
Who We Are

Entering into the same university, breaking into the same department, each wanting to become the newest face of the university's theatre department. Each met with their own set of obstacles, which of these newcomers truly have what it takes to survive in this cut throat department? </p>
<p>These are the top two ideas that the short film will be based on.</p>
<p>I am Jared D. Howard, a graduating senior Theatre Performance major, at Georgia State University.  With goals of becoming a better thespian, while seeking a life useful, I am fighting to accomplish set goals. Often times we are told to chase our dreams and never let anything stop you.  Well this is the first step toward chasing my cinematic dreams.  I am reaching out to YOU in order to help fund a QUALITY short film in order to build my cinematic brand, now branching out into the field of writing and directing.  With the help of trusted individuals, it is my goal to advance not only myself, but those involved, one step closer to their dreams.  Your monetary contribution would help reach these goals by allowing the production to be filmed with quality technology, those involved to be compensated fairly, and the necessary fees to be taken care of.  As a college student, funds are limited and let's face it, no one wants to watch, or give credit, to anything produced, filmed or presented low budget.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I have a goal of $6,500. 50% of that budget will be spent toward equipment, space rentals, promotional expenses and miscellaneous production items that have been deemed necessary. The other 50% will be used to compensate those involved (wardrobe, hair stylists, make-up artists, production assistants, actors, choreographers, editors, etc.) Because no one wants to utilize their talents for free, nor should they have to.  Many times we are expecting of favors or freebies (especially in the art world) and our final products reflect just that.  So to ensure that this production is at it's best, I can not and will not ask anyone to work for free.</p>
<h3> </h3>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The final product will have the potential to be shopped to various networks in hopes to become something greater than we initially imagined.  This production has been written as an entire series, however, I am using the pilot episode as a short film instead.  This giving the viewers a chance to really see what the product is about. That way, we can figure out what the viewers really enjoyed, learn from mistakes and push to produce an even better production if it is received well enough to continue with.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The challenges we face are all money related.  Without proper funding, that effects the tools needed, the quality of talent and the amount of time we would have to shoot.  Of course, we would make it work as best we can, but the financial support would take a tremendous load off of the production's back. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help.  Your contribution would be greatly appreciated by spreading the word, sharing the link and prayers of great success! Keeping God first can, and will, always be most beneficial. </p>

<h3>Behind the Show</h3>
<p>I'm Calibe Thompson, the Executive Producer of ""Taste the Islands"". That title means I'm responsible for bringing the people and resources together to get this show done and on air.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this journey in 2014, Chef Irie expressed a desire to me, to have a cooking show that he would host. I wanted to create a national television series. Two Jamaicans on a mission! It was a natural fit.</p>
<p>I sold my car, ate just-add-water pancakes from a box, and rode a bicycle for a few months to come up with the funds to get production on season 1 started. We found some camera guys, shot some cooking scenes in a friend's kitchen, I edited everything... and then it all sat on my computer for a year.</p>
<p>I'll put the complete story in a memoir some day but suffice to say that after that year, through our preparedness and Chef's connections, we had the opportunity to present the finished pilot to our local PBS affiliate, and the rest was history.</p>
<p>We are the first Jamaican-produced and Jamaican-hosted series on national public television in the US. We've been embraced by the Caribbean community and so many people who simply love Caribbean cuisine and culture. It's really important to us to keep this project alive, and make it bigger and better. The first time around we used bubble gum and shoe strings to piece the show together. This time we spent a little bit on nuts and bolts too.</p>
<p>This time we have a Haitian Chef (Chef Thia) and an island explorer (Lisa Lee) along for the ride with Chef Irie. There are clear improvements in the production, but we still have a little shortfall in the funding. That's why we're turning to you.</p>
<p>In Jamaica we say ""one one cocoa full basket"", meaning we'll get to our goal a little at a time. The basket is almost full, but we need a few more cocoas to get us to the finishing point.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We actually need much more than the number in the title here to pay the bills:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many on the team have only been partially paid, others have not been paid at all. These hard working people have contributed their time and talents: <ul>
<li>Performing</li>
<li>Editing</li>
<li>Coordinating logistics</li>
<li>Shooting video</li>
<li>Shooting still photos</li>
<li>Contributing other supporting activities and facilities</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are also very substantial technical and insurance fees associated with public television broadcast</li>
</ul>
<p>Please do what you can to help us get through this.</p>
<p>Contributors can enjoy perks from as simple as the satisfaction of knowing they helped Season 2 happen, to signed letters, cookbooks, access to watch the episodes before they broadcast, and even on-screen credits in the show.</p>
<p>If we raise more than the amount needed to truly clear all our bills, we'll have a little cushion to get started on an even more dynamic season 3!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The excitement built the first time around garnered coverage from publications including The New York Daily news, Atlanta Black Star, The South Florida Times, NBC6, WSVN, The Jamaica Gleaner and beyond. This time, we had the privilege of traveling to Barbados, so we're looking forward to the support of the Jamaican, Haitian and Barbadian communities, as well as all the fans who have grown to love the show, website and cookbook!</p>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><div>
<p>Please note: we have to deliver the completed episodes by the end of January so we only have until the 16th to make this happen. If you can't help financially please help in other ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you know someone who can contribute, please encourage them to.</li>
<li>You have friends on Facebook, Twitter and other social platforms. Please share our request with them. They may be willing to contribute.</li>

The evening begins like the countless others they have spent pitched up in their favourite spots looking out at the nearby forest. Tonight however, there's one big difference.

Paul is perfect for this role, as he's an extremely versatile actor and is best known for playing Billy Kitchen, an ally of the the Shelby family, in <i>Pea</i><i>ky Blinders</i> where he appeared alongside Cillian Murphy and Tom Hardy, and as Nicolae in <i>Dracula Untold</i>. As an actor, he's not only believable as a forest ranger who has spent years honing his skills, but we hope to show a more sensitive side to his performance as a father.</p><p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484087279/mau6fnxbzgscioxthlft.jpg"" src=""""/><br/> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486228595/w5skpw9ch8ic8gwcwyq8.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486218527/bicg2bitxz84sxacv3vo.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Paul Bullion as Duncan </strong><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486227748/b39pya421e2t1uir5ste.png"" src=""""/><br/><strong>Rio Walker as Duncan's son Ross</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486236903/saq809p8c5syf2dogk30.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>TJ as Oscar</strong></p><p>We want to create a film that  is inspired by classic horror films like <i>The Conjuring</i> and <i>The Innkeepers</i> that relied on creating a sense of dread and foreboding, rather than special effects to keep the audience on the edge of their seats.

The reason that we're running the crowdfunding campaign is that we can't do this alone.

The evening begins like the countless others they have spent pitched up in their favourite spots looking out at the nearby forest. Tonight however, there's one big difference. It's the first time that he's brought his son along with him. At the end of a long day together they have settled under the night sky to watch the stars but when Duncan looks out into the woods, something looks back. The film features rising star Paul Bullion as Duncan, a proud outdoorsman. Duncan isn't the typical character you'd find in a horror film, he's perfectly at home alone in the wilderness and capable of looking after himself, so when presented with a possible threat he's thrown by the situation. Paul is perfect for this role, as he's an extremely versatile actor and is best known for playing Billy Kitchen, an ally of the the Shelby family, in Peaky Blinders where he appeared alongside Cillian Murphy and Tom Hardy, and as Nicolae in Dracula Untold. As an actor, he's not only believable as a forest ranger who has spent years honing his skills, but we hope to show a more sensitive side to his performance as a father. Paul Bullion as Duncan Rio Walker as Duncan's son RossTJ as OscarWe want to create a film that  is inspired by classic horror films like The Conjuring and The Innkeepers that relied on creating a sense of dread and foreboding, rather than special effects to keep the audience on the edge of their seats. It's going to be an atmospheric piece that will hopefully grip audiences and show a different side to director Chris Cronin's work. The reason that we're running the crowdfunding campaign is that we can't do this alone. Over the past few years we've made several high concept, no budget short films like Sophie's Fortune, Moments and Skye. Whilst we're incredibly proud of what we achieved, making Oscar's Bell will help us take the next step towards making our first feature film.There are several challenges to overcome with making the film. Whilst £5,500 may sound like a lot, all the money we receive will be used to ensure that Oscar's Bell has the highest possible production values. Central to the film is Oscar, the dog that will feature heavily in the film. Due to the requirements of the script we will be working with a german shepherd called TJ and a specialist animal handler from Animal Direction, a leading company who specialise in training animals for film & television. As animal lovers it's important to us that TJ is properly trained and well looked after, which is why we'll be filming over two nights.In order to create the sense of forboding and dread in the film, we will need special equipment including generators and lighting to help us film at night.The chart below shows a breakdown of how the money we raise will be used.We Still Need Crew!Whilst we have most departments covered, we're always looking for new people to collaborate with. We'd love to hear from people who may be interested in helping out, in particular we're looking for:- Assistant Director- Make Up Artist (FILLED)- Art Director/ Production Designer (FILLED)- Script Supervisor (FILLED)- Runner (Ability to drive is required)Get in touch with this page for more details on how you can get involved. If you just want to be on set and help out let us know!Sharing the campaign. In some ways this is even more important than contributing financially. And every connection helps - so please do share this campaign with your social networks and contacts. Retweet it. Post it. It all helps to spread the word.Director & Co-Writer - Chris CroninShowreel - https://vimeo.com/121201050Chris is well known for his high concept films that have thrilled audiences around the world.

Chris’ previous films include Balcony which won at the prestigious Raindance Film Festival and was described as; “A well-made and unique, but more importantly, intriguing piece of work that leaves you thinking about it after the 14th and final second has passed."" David F. Sandberg, director of Lights Out and Annabelle 2 selected Balcony to receive the Technical Achievement Award at the 15 Second Horror Challenge. Chris’ previous films have won several awards including People's Choice Award in the Reed Film competition at BAFTA for his short Peter and Best Director for the 48FilmProject Unkillable, presented at Directors Guild of America.Producer - Andrew OldburyAndrew began his career working in development on the BBC medical drama Holby City after graduating with a Master’s degree in Literature from the University of Manchester.

<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>""Faded"" follows the 28-year-old Jenna, who is happily married to her husband and best friend, Ryan. Her life comes crumbling down when Ryan gets into a car accident, causing him to lose his long term memory, which tragically, includes Jenna.  </p>
<p>With Ryan recuperating at home, Jenna desperately and unsuccessfully tries to reconnect with him. She bravely faces rejection each day, but she is relentless in her attempts to help Ryan recover his health and his memory.</p>
<p>Jenna’s commitment to Ryan’s recovery and her marriage begins to fray. Finally, however, her efforts and time may be proving productive as Ryan shows glimmers of his old self.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Director's Statement </h2>
<p>I have always been fascinated by the concept of loss. When we think of the word ""loss,"" our minds jump to the idea of losing something, or someone, that we love permanently. But what happens if one day, we have to lose someone even though they’re very much alive and standing right in front of us?</p>
<p>It comes down to the question of whether we want to continue fighting for what we had, and if we do fight, how many cold responses and rejections can we take before we surrender to our new reality of living with the person who no longer wants us, and just hope to god that things will work themselves out one day.</p>
<p>For the past 7 years, my father has been suffering a form of depression, and he'd have moments when he didn't remember me, brief instances when he simply lost his memories, and those moments have left a lasting impact on how I feel about loss. Losing someone is never easy, but it's a different tragedy when the person you've lost is sitting in front of you. </p>
<p>Exploring this unique form of loss, I’ve finally decided to tell this story. Because as a filmmaker, I think there’s something very brave in being able to grieve, then moving on to share that very pain you’ve felt, opening yourself up to strangers in the hope that your story will allow them a chance to live more fully through your pain or to hopefully discover new meanings from what you’ve shared.</p>

This is Mochon High School in Rio de Janeiro. These are smart, talented, and good kids; however, because of who they are (poor black youths), they are likely to become part of the statistic and 3.7x more likely to die at the hands of state agents. 
Anything from $5 to $10,000. Every little bit helps and we are sincerely grateful.
To increase our changes for success, we have created several fundraising account on other crowdfunding sites with equal or smaller amounts.

<p>My name is Kathryn King and I'm a music industry veteran dealing in many different genres of music. My love of jazz blossomed when I was just a wee tad, the daughter of a great singer, Jeri Southern, and step-daughter of a great player/composer/arranger, Bill Holman. In 1998 I did a compilation of some of my mom's best recordings, as a tribute to her. My impulse to do a film about Bill Holman derives first from the immense respect and love I have for him but, equally important, the fact that a comprehensive profile of this superb artist - an NEA Jazz Master - does not currently exist. The fact that he is still charging full speed ahead at age 90 and that his band is smokin' hot after 42 years of playing, touring and recording means that my expert cinematographer Gil Gilbert and I have had the benefit of hours of primary source voices, perspectives, and performances as we have worked on this project for the last 4 years. We are far from finished - there is still some shooting to do, plus editing and a daunting mountain of music licensing ahead - but we really need help in order to continue, let alone complete the film. I hope you'll join us in making Charting Jazz happen! Bill Holman is one of a kind, a great American artist, and I want the world to know about him. Check out the video for Charting Jazz!</p>
<h2>The Filmmakers</h2>
<h3>Videographer: Gil Gilbert</h3>
<p>Gil Gilbert is a videographer who has for decades produced EPKs and other creative, tailored pieces for branding and promotion. For 15 years he worked for Sony Music, creating promotional videos for such artists as Billy Joel, Titanic (the film), Wynton Marsalis, The Pixies, Yo-Yo Ma, and Roger Waters. Recent clients include the Metropolitan Opera, the Olana Foundation and Ippolita Jewelry. In recent years he has branched out to longform documentaries, the most recent of which, Misfire: the Rise and Fall of the Shooting Gallery, was invited to show at multiple film festivals upon its release in 2013.</p>
<h3>Producer/Director: Kathryn King</h3>
<p>Kathryn King, producer/director of the film and stepdaughter of Bill Holman, has spent her entire 45-year career in the music industry. Over the course of this time she has concentrated on two main areas of endeavor - publicity/marketing and audio/video production. Her eclectic tastes inspired her to devote her energies to a wide variety of musical genres as, among other things, Director of U.S. Operations for both ECM Records and Teldec, Director of the Classical Division of ABC Records, Director of Product Management at Sony Classical, and as independent record producer and media consultant. Over the last 20 years she has produced promotional videos on such artists as Esa-Pekka Salonen, the Los Angeles Guitar Quartet, Ottmar Liebert, Midori, and others. Her recordings have been nominated for Grammy Awards three times and in 1986 she won the Grammy for Best Children's Recording for her production of one of 35 records made for Sesame Street. A veteran of many years of publicizing and marketing artists and their recordings, King has enjoyed working with the Vienna Boys Choir, Midori, Art Ensemble of Chicago, Susan Narucki, Donald Berman,Thomas Hampson, Keith Jarrett, Other Minds, Netherlands Bach Society, Iannis Xenakis’ Persepolis L.A., Midori, Zuill Bailey, Frans Brüggen, Denis Matsuev, the San Lucas Band, Arvo Pärt, Emanuel Ax, James Morris, St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra, Paul Moravec, Nikolaus Harnoncourt, LAGQ, Heiner Goebbels, Elena Ruehr, the Juilliard String Quartet, Ottmar Liebert, Jane Eaglen, the Hilliard Ensemble, Bill Frisell, Esa-Pekka Salonen, Daniel Lentz, the Del Sol String Quartet, Yefim Bronfman, the Kuijken Brothers, David Torn, the Eclectic Orange Festival, John Abercrombie and many others.</p>
<h2>The Campaign</h2>
<p><strong>About this project</strong></p>
<p>Charting Jazz: The Mastery of Bill Holman will tell the story of one of America’s most exceptional musicians, jazz arranger/composer Bill Holman. Revered and beloved by players, critics and scholars of the genre, Holman is nevertheless not well known to the general public. It’s not an exaggeration to say that millions have heard his charts (arrangements) for such artists as Natalie Cole, Count Basie, Michael Bublé, Stan Kenton, the Fifth Dimension, Tony Bennett, Carmen McRae, Lee Konitz, Gerry Mulligan, and countless others, but even dedicated music lovers often don’t understand what the role of an arranger is and why it is important. This film will explain the pivotal role of arrangers in every recording we hear and why this man is considered a consummate master of the art.</p>
<p>Charting Jazz will show Bill Holman in action, conducting a residency at the prestigious Eastman School of Music, rehearsing his own ensemble, the 16-piece Bill Holman Band, and in performance at a supper club in Los Angeles playing the entire contents of the Band’s Brilliant Corners CD, an album of Monk tunes that has taken on iconic status since its original release. Bill Holman won a Grammy for one of the arrangements on the album, for Monk’s “Straight, No Chaser”. In the words of Doug Ramsey, who interviews Holman in the film and writes the essential jazz blog Rifftides:</p>
<p>“Allowed to drop out of sight, never reissued, Holman’s Monk CD recorded in 1997 is one of the large-ensemble masterpieces of the second half of the twentieth century. Nor has there been anything that I know of to match it in the new millennium.”</p>
<p>Charting Jazz will interview Bill Holman’s composing and arranging colleagues, musicians in his band, young players coming up, producers, writers, educators and fans who count Bill Holman among the greatest exponents of America’s artform, JAZZ.</p>

<p>We’d LOVE to hear from anyone who has memories, anecdotes, or questions that they’d like to share about Bill or his music. Please post them here in the comment section, or on the social media of your choice and include a link to this Indiegogo campaign.</p> <h2>About Bill Holman</h2>
<p>NEA Jazz Master Bill Holman (b.1927 in Olive, CA) has been sought after since the earliest years of his career by band leaders, instrumental soloists, and singers alike for his skills as arranger. His unique style utilizes often complex contrapuntal textures juxtaposed with spare, elegant lines which form the perfect framework for a soloist. Holman has provided arrangements for many stellar artists including Charlie Barnet, Count Basie, Louie Bellson, Tony Bennett, Bob Brookmeyer, Michael Bublé, June Christy, Natalie Cole, Buddy de Franco, Maynard Ferguson, The Fifth Dimension, Terry Gibbs, Woody Herman, Lee Konitz, Peggy Lee, Mel Lewis, Carmen McRae, Gerry Mulligan, Mark Murphy, Anita O’Day, Art Pepper, Buddy Rich, Diane Schuur, Doc Severinson, Zoot Sims, Mel Tormé, Sarah Vaughan, Joe Williams, Phil Woods, and many recently completed commissions.</p>
<p>For decades Holman has enjoyed teaching at composing/arranging clinics and master classes throughout both the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., he has taught at the Berklee, Eastman, Manhattan, and Grove Schools of Music, and at many universities. Outside the U.S., in such countries as Germany, Holland, Switzerland, England and in Scandinavia, he is frequently invited to conduct established resident jazz orchestras at radio stations and festivals, in addition to educational clinics and workshops.</p>
<p>Mr. Holman formed the 16-piece Bill Holman Big Band in 1975. The ensemble continues to perform in clubs, concerts and festivals. Holman, whose roots as tenor saxophonist, composer and writer extend as far back as 1949 in ensembles with such artists as Ike Carpenter, Stan Kenton, Charlie Barnet, Shelly Manne, Shorty Rogers and Mel Lewis, is perhaps most revered today for ushering the genre of big band music into the 21st century. In his hands the language of the big band has continually evolved, so that the arrangements he writes today sound utterly fresh and of-the-moment. The combination of his innovative, virtuosic, often whimsical writing with the mighty power of his band, which has been rehearsing and performing together for over 40 years, is an experience his audiences don’t soon forget. He has been nominated for the Grammy Award fifteen times, most recently in 2013 for his instrumental composition Without a Paddle. He has won three Grammys - in 1987 for Best Instrumental Arrangement (Take the A Train, for Doc Severinsen and the Tonight Show Orchestra); in 1995 for Best Instrumental Composition (A View from the Side for the Bill Holman Band); and in 1997 for a stunning arrangement of Thelonious Monk’s Straight, No Chaser, also recorded by the Bill Holman Band on their album Brilliant Corners.</p>
<h3>The National Endowment for the Arts</h3>
<p>bestowed the nation’s highest honor in jazz, the 2010 NEA Jazz Masters Award, on Bill Holman “in recognition of a lifetime of extraordinary achievement as composer, arranger and tenor saxophonist.” </p>

<h3>Who am I? Who are we?</h3>
<p>I am a debuting filmmaker with an international background, which is reflected in the film. I am Danish by birth, Belgian by education, Ukrainian by passion. <br/><br/>I graduated from film school in Belgium in 2008, and have spend the time since then working on different short films, feature films, art films. (Check out my LinkedIn on <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/helene-wang-b6a8391b/%C2%A0for"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.linkedin.com/in/helene-wang-b6a8391...</a> a full resume or my youtube channel helenewangfilm for my independent short films)<br/><br/>The feature film that we are aiming to make is about a young woman, Mia, who lives separate lives with different partner, lying to them both but loving them both intensely. Telling her lovers that she works abroad, the reality is different, she works in a high end strip club in Brussels, where she gets the approval and admiration that she desperately needs. When a sardonic man enters her life and starts messing around, things turn ugly, and it becomes increasingly difficult for her to keep the balance.</p>
<p>My personal story has a huge impact on the movie. It is not autobiographical, but the emotions and a lot of the struggles of the main character, Mia, are real and mine. Every step I take the last year has been towards this project. With the trailer, I want to show the beauty and the struggle which is inside my mind. Without it, we will only have words to describe the project - and they will not nearly cover what we have in mind!</p>
<p>The film will be a co-production between Belgium and Ukraine, and possibly other countries like Denmark, UK or Germany. I am working with independent Ukrainian production company UFI (Ukrainian Film Institute Production). UFI is looking for sponsors for the film, but most investors want to have an idea of the project. <br/>At the same time, we are looking for a Belgian producer to take on the main part of the production. But we need your help to finish off the teaser for them to see. </p>
<p>We have already shot the main part of the teaser. We need to do some additional shooting and sound recording, and to edit and mix the teaser. We have shot it on the BlackMagicMini (the clip above is from behind the scenes, shot with a lose hand using a Canon5D).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>An honest deal</h3>
<p>We are looking for money to pay for rental of editing equipment, editor's fee and mixing. <br/>After finishing, we need to burn the teaser to DVDs etc to get it to the investors.</p>
<p>If we reach our goal, we will spend some of the money on promotional material to go along with the teaser. Posters, flyers, business cards, prints etc. If we only manage to get a part of the total sum, we will focus on the teaser.</p>
<p>We are keeping all costs as low as possible, but we can't compromise the visual quality we need. We want to work with young and upcoming professionals and pay them appropriately. You will contribute to an honest way of working, where people are being paid for their skills.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why I want to make the film at all?</h3>
<p>The idea of the project has grown for a few years. At the moment, the script is finished. It is hard, visual, sensual, and dealing with the profound self perception that we all struggle with - women in particular. The main character of the film, Mia, feeds on the approval and admiration of others, escaping immediately when she risks to fail. She is hungry for love, but fails to find it in its pure form. <br/>When I tell the story to women, I very often notice a pain in their eyes towards the end. In the beginning, they are all in love with the story, which is catchy and intriguing. But when we start digging into matters, they feel that it is about them, that it strikes one of the most vulnerable parts of their self-esteem, something they struggle with but try to hide behind a facade of happiness. Just like Mia, in the film. With my film, I want to reach out to all these women, and to the men who know them</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Almost there</h3>
<p>We are close to our goal. We have invested time and money so far, and we are building a team based on mutual trust and enthusiasm. A lot of people in Ukraine, Belgium, UK are working in their free time to get our project through. We want to take it all over the world, but we need to finish the last part. <br/><br/>Are you with us?</p>

If we reach our goal, we will spend some of the money on promotional material to go along with the teaser. Posters, flyers, business cards, prints etc. If we only manage to get a part of the total sum, we will focus on the teaser.
We are keeping all costs as low as possible, but we can't compromise the visual quality we need. We want to work with young and upcoming professionals and pay them appropriately. You will contribute to an honest way of working, where people are being paid for their skills.

Why I want to make the film at all?
The idea of the project has grown for a few years. At the moment, the script is finished. It is hard, visual, sensual, and dealing with the profound self perception that we all struggle with - women in particular. The main character of the film, Mia, feeds on the approval and admiration of others, escaping immediately when she risks to fail. She is hungry for love, but fails to find it in its pure form. When I tell the story to women, I very often notice a pain in their eyes towards the end. In the beginning, they are all in love with the story, which is catchy and intriguing. But when we start digging into matters, they feel that it is about them, that it strikes one of the most vulnerable parts of their self-esteem, something they struggle with but try to hide behind a facade of happiness. Just like Mia, in the film. With my film, I want to reach out to all these women, and to the men who know them

Almost there
We are close to our goal. We have invested time and money so far, and we are building a team based on mutual trust and enthusiasm. A lot of people in Ukraine, Belgium, UK are working in their free time to get our project through. We want to take it all over the world, but we need to finish the last part. Are you with us?

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>""This is my second documentary film.

<p><i>This film not only documents what fascism is and how it rises, but also what it isn't.

<p>Welcome!
Thanks so much for taking the time out to learn more about this short
film.  Yemi’s Dilemma is the story of
three sisters, a wedding and a family torn apart because of it.  The sisters are first generation Americans,
who, although they are proud of their Nigerian heritage, tend to relate more to
the American culture within which they were raised.  Their parents, however, have a strong desire
to maintain the traditions of their country and this ultimately leads to
culture clashes in the family.  The

secret from her parents that will forever change the dynamic within the family for better and for worse.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The money raised for ""FishCake"" will go to help dedicated doctors and scientist fight and hopefully cure this life shattering disease that affects people all over the world. </p>
<p>More than 30 million people worldwide live with Alzheimer's today and every 68 seconds a person develops this disease. Over 60 million people are expected to have Alzheimer's by 2030. Director, Drea Garcia has a family history with Alzheimer's. Her great-great grandmother had Alzheimer's along with her great grandmother and fears her own mother will develop it in life. Executive Producer, Leah Pollack has a family member who is suffering from Alzheimers and knows the struggles. Alzheimer's may not directly affect you at this moment but we need to find a cure to better our future. </p>
<p>Our Crew is made up of talented students, who have worked on a variety of projects and have certainly gained experience. Drea Garcia started out as an actor and has the knowledge of the type of communication actors need. She grew up in a large family taking care of kids and she loves the light children can bring and hopes to capture that in the film. Executive Producer Leah Pollack has produced her fair share of projects and is also a great editor. She is currently hard at work making connections with Alzheimer groups in the Savannah Georgia area as well as taking care of a large amount of work to make this film come to life. </p>
<p>We have two young cast members that we are so lucky to work with. We have young Tiffany, who will be playing the role of Mila and Sebastian, who will be playing the role of Sammy. </p>

<p><br/></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>All involved with this project know the difficulties faced when making a film of any kind. We have all experienced and overcome these hurdles in the past and have made some exceptional art. We are ready to face anything that could hinder FishCake. </p>
<p>Examples include:</p>
<p>- Scheduling conflicts</p>
<p>-""Acts of God"" (severe weather, flood, wild fire, etc.)</p>
<p>- Spontaneous equipment failure.</p>
<p>- Location Issues (involving exterior/outdoor scenes)</p>
<p>-Limited Resources </p>
<p>-Child Labor Laws ( Children can only work a certain number of hours a day on set. For good reason!)</p>
<p>Our plan to avoid such challenges would be to monitor the weather and schedule alternative plans just in case as well as have the set prepared before the children arrive. If all possible we will have crew members stay at the location rental the night before and plan for the weekend. We have been hard at work with pre production but we need your donations to help us move into our final steps of preproduction and finally shoot this poignant film! </p>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot contribute monetary funds there is always the chance to donate food for our cast and crew! We also need items such as kayaks, small boats, and fishing gear. </p>
<p>If you are a small business located in or around a Savannah GA the ""Fishy Business"" perk is right for you!</p>
<p>Last but not least, help spread the word, invite others to view or contribute to our campaign and a worthy cause!</p>

<p>Long Island Love Story is about two brothers Michael &amp; Anthony, and how they help each other figure out their individual relationship problems during a huge family party.</p>
<p>Michael is a hopeless romantic who wears his hear on his sleeve. He has been foolish in love in the past, and has had his heart broken. He meets Amy and after six months of dating, he finally coerces her to come out to his parents to meet them and his entire family. She comes from a small family where she has no siblings or cousins. Also at the party, is Michaels high school sweetheart, Jess, who Michael has no idea that she is there.</p>
<p>Anthony is a kind hearted man child, who has been dating his girlfriend Laura for eight years. She has matured since their college days, but Anthony has not. When Laura finds out that she is pregnant she decides to tell Anthony that it's over and he will have no responsibilities when the baby comes. </p>
<p>It's a sweet and funny romantic comedy in the vein of Brothers McMullen.</p>
<p>This is a very important project to me and my wonderful cast. Since I graduated from college I have been trying to break into the film industry. I've worked as a cameraman for many different companies, but haven't gotten a gig on a tv show or feature film. After plugging along for a while, I decided that I was not going to wait for someone to give me a break. I was going to make my own. I wrote Long Island Love Story as a debut feature using all I had at my disposal, (Mine &amp; my cousins houses, and tons of family as background actors and bit part players).  We filmed over 11 days from July/August of this year, and we did so much with such a small budget.</p>
<p>When I was writing Long Island Love Story I posted it onto the script review website, The Black List. I received a wonderful evaluation on my first draft. Here are just a few of the things that were said about that draft.</p>
<p><b>""The dynamic between Anthony and Michael is endearing and fun to watch.""</b></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Ok so here's what we need...</p>
<p>Principal Photography (The actual filming of the movie) is finished. The reason we're launching this campaign is to raise funds for post production, and to pay our crew and actors, who have worked so hard for very little money. I put our goal at $4500, which should be enough for everything we need, including paying for the perks.</p>
<p>Here is what your contributions will go to:</p>
<p>- Hiring a musician / composer to write the score to the film *Music* </p>
<p>- A sound editor to fix up some scenes with audio issues.</p>
<p>- Color grading and digital effects when editing</p>
<p>- Paying the crew &amp; cast </p>
<p>- Entry fees to festivals all over the country, Sundance, Tribeca, Cannes, TIFF, SXSW etc.</p>
<p>- To hold a premiere screening at a local movie theater to celebrate completion of the film.</p>
<p>- Cover the costs of the perks.</p>
<p>Any bit helps, and we hope you contribute!!</p>
<p><b>Perks!</b></p>
<p>What is an Indiegogo campaign without perks? So we have some pretty good perks from a standard ""thank you"" at the end credits of the film, personalized thank you videos, DVD copy, T-shirt, signed posters!</p>
<p> If you want to be even more awesome and donate more you could have dinner with the cast &amp; director, tickets to the premiere *NYC Residents ONLY* and producers credits. (Producer credit doesn't entitle you to ownership of the film or any future profits should the film be sold. It is merely a vanity credit.)</p>
<p>If we're unable to reach our goal of $4,500 the funds will go to paying the cast and crew (less than if we'd reached the goal) and fulfilling are perks to our contributors. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>The impact of fulfilling this campaign will be substantial for this film and myself. I have found success as a camera man, but being a creator, a storyteller is what I long to do. In this business you either wait forever for someone to give you a shot, or you surround yourself with like minded people, and make your own shot.</div>
<div>We hope to raise funds so we can put the final touches on this very personal project and start the process of submitting it to festivals so the world can see what we've done.</div>
<div>We are all dreamers.</div>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>There are risks &amp; challenges with supporting any project on Indiegogo. Good thing for Long Island Love Story, there isn't any risk at all as we have finished production, and are seeking funds for post production, festival entries &amp; compensation for our hard working crew and actors.</div>
<div>It's as simple as this. The movie is shot, we need to put it through extensive post production. Once that's done, we'll send it out and start fulfilling our perks to whoever donates.</div>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<p>If you are unable to contribute, that's fine. Get the word out on social media; Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and let others know of what we're trying to do and show them our trailer and campaign page. </p>
<p>Help us complete this wonderful film that we cant wait to show to the world!</p>
<p> </p>
</div></div>","Hello Indiegogo! I'm James Defalco I am a filmmaker, and let me tell you a little bit about myself. I am the writer, director & producer of Long Island Love Story. I graduated from Five Towns College in 2010 with a Bachelors Degree in Film & Video Production. Since Graduating, I have held many jobs in the film and live entertainment industry. I've worked as a freelance cameraman for the IATSE (Which is the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees) for over 5 years. I have also worked as a cameraman for such sports teams and musical acts as The New York Islanders, Madonna, Justin Bieber, Nicki Minaj, Skrillex, The Weeknd, Lil' Wayne and hundreds more.

Long Island Love Story is about two brothers Michael & Anthony, and how they help each other figure out their individual relationship problems during a huge family party.
Michael is a hopeless romantic who wears his hear on his sleeve. He has been foolish in love in the past, and has had his heart broken. He meets Amy and after six months of dating, he finally coerces her to come out to his parents to meet them and his entire family. She comes from a small family where she has no siblings or cousins. Also at the party, is Michaels high school sweetheart, Jess, who Michael has no idea that she is there.
Anthony is a kind hearted man child, who has been dating his girlfriend Laura for eight years. She has matured since their college days, but Anthony has not. When Laura finds out that she is pregnant she decides to tell Anthony that it's over and he will have no responsibilities when the baby comes. 
It's a sweet and funny romantic comedy in the vein of Brothers McMullen.
This is a very important project to me and my wonderful cast. Since I graduated from college I have been trying to break into the film industry. I've worked as a cameraman for many different companies, but haven't gotten a gig on a tv show or feature film. After plugging along for a while, I decided that I was not going to wait for someone to give me a break. I was going to make my own. I wrote Long Island Love Story as a debut feature using all I had at my disposal, (Mine & my cousins houses, and tons of family as background actors and bit part players).  We filmed over 11 days from July/August of this year, and we did so much with such a small budget.
When I was writing Long Island Love Story I posted it onto the script review website, The Black List. I received a wonderful evaluation on my first draft. Here are just a few of the things that were said about that draft.
""The dynamic between Anthony and Michael is endearing and fun to watch.""
""The script has some entertaining banter, and a number of funny lines that keep the characters  and story interesting.""
""The story has potential to be developed into a commercially viable indie comedy that would appeal to audiences who enjoyed movies like ""Meet the Fockers"" and ""Rachel Getting Married.""
If you contribute to this project you will help make the dreams of me and everyone involved a reality; completing a feature film & sending it off to the festival circuit. 
Production is done, and we're in the process of post-production and need a little bit of help getting that done. I.E sound mixing / color grading etc.
The Cast!
Here is a look at our amazing cast. 

 
 
 

James Defalco plays Michael
 

Ryan Gregorio plays Anthony

What We Need & What You Get
Ok so here's what we need...
Principal Photography (The actual filming of the movie) is finished. The reason we're launching this campaign is to raise funds for post production, and to pay our crew and actors, who have worked so hard for very little money. I put our goal at $4500, which should be enough for everything we need, including paying for the perks.
Here is what your contributions will go to:
- Hiring a musician / composer to write the score to the film *Music* 
- A sound editor to fix up some scenes with audio issues.
- Color grading and digital effects when editing
- Paying the crew & cast 
- Entry fees to festivals all over the country, Sundance, Tribeca, Cannes, TIFF, SXSW etc.
- To hold a premiere screening at a local movie theater to celebrate completion of the film.
- Cover the costs of the perks.
Any bit helps, and we hope you contribute!!
Perks!
What is an Indiegogo campaign without perks? So we have some pretty good perks from a standard ""thank you"" at the end credits of the film, personalized thank you videos, DVD copy, T-shirt, signed posters!
 If you want to be even more awesome and donate more you could have dinner with the cast & director, tickets to the premiere *NYC Residents ONLY* and producers credits. (Producer credit doesn't entitle you to ownership of the film or any future profits should the film be sold. It is merely a vanity credit.)
If we're unable to reach our goal of $4,500 the funds will go to paying the cast and crew (less than if we'd reached the goal) and fulfilling are perks to our contributors. 

The Impact
The impact of fulfilling this campaign will be substantial for this film and myself. I have found success as a camera man, but being a creator, a storyteller is what I long to do. In this business you either wait forever for someone to give you a shot, or you surround yourself with like minded people, and make your own shot.
We hope to raise funds so we can put the final touches on this very personal project and start the process of submitting it to festivals so the world can see what we've done.
We are all dreamers.

Risks & Challenges
There are risks & challenges with supporting any project on Indiegogo. Good thing for Long Island Love Story, there isn't any risk at all as we have finished production, and are seeking funds for post production, festival entries & compensation for our hard working crew and actors.
It's as simple as this. The movie is shot, we need to put it through extensive post production. Once that's done, we'll send it out and start fulfilling our perks to whoever donates.

Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:
If you are unable to contribute, that's fine. Get the word out on social media; Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and let others know of what we're trying to do and show them our trailer and campaign page.

</h3><h3><br/></h3><h3><b>About the Film</b></h3><div>
<i>Our War </i>tells the dramatic story of a family that sees itself divided, much like the country itself, at the outset of the American Civil War. When North Carolina votes to secede from the Union, the eldest son of our family, Jim, decides to leave for the North to join Mr. Lincoln's Army, choosing to fight against his own home, and family.  As the war progresses, the war takes its toll on both Jim and his family, affecting them in ways they couldn't possibly imagine. And the war's end sets the stage for a dramatic, and possibly deadly, reunion. <br/><i></i><br/>The film was conceived by Co-Writer and Director, JD Mayo. Having made several films over the years, as well as being a Civil War reenactor, and passionate about American history, JD was ready to tackle a dramatic story set in the midst of America's deadliest conflict. He shared the story with Co-Writer and Producer Steven Hancock, a fellow filmmaker, historian and reenactor. Both worked at developing the story into a powerful tale of family, betrayal, and war. <br/><br/>Inspired by historical films such as Ron Maxwell's <i>Copperhead</i>, Ang Lee's<i> Ride with the Devil, </i>and the miniseries <i>Hatfields &amp; McCoys</i>, the filmmakers have striven to tell this little known truth of American history: That many southerners chose to fight with the Union armies, fighting against their own home and families. Once completed, the film will provide a very dramatic story, while remaining truthful to the time. <br/><br/><b>The Cast<br/><br/></b><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459386331/RyanThompsonasJim_zn6qql.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 379.5px;height: 253px;""/></p>

<h3>What These Funds Will Help With:</h3>
<p>We have a talented cast and crew coming on board to help make the film possible. However, in order to achieve our goals, we are going to need to raise some funding. Our goal through this campaign is to raise $10,000. From these funds, we will be able to cover several different aspects of the production. This include:  <br/></p> <ul> <li>
<i>Pre-Production</i>: Funds will help us to either purchase, or rent, props for filming, such as period weaponry and equipment. We will also be able to construct any sets or items we'll need to use for filming.</li>
</ul>
<ul> <li>
<i>Principal Photography</i>: Funding will help us to pay our cast and crew, as well as provide amenities on set (Food, drinks, etc.), during filming. We can also use these funds to rent any equpment, such as cameras and sound equipment, to make the film.  <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<ul> <li>
<i>Post-Production</i>: These funds will also help us with post-production costs. These include hiring people to help with editing, music, sound design (Including ADR and sound effects additions), color correction and visual effects, polishing the film to make it look and sound as terrific as possible. This will also help us to create promotional materials, such as trailers, posters, etc.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<ul><li>
<i>Festival Submissions</i>: In addition to finishing the film, these funds will help us to submit the film to film festivals across the country, giving thousands of people the opportunity to see it, and react to it. <br/>
</li></ul>
<p>And of course, with every cent we make over our goal, we will be able to make the film even better. <br/></p>
<p>By helping to donate to our campaign, you will not only help us to achieve our filmmaking goals, but you will also receive some amazing swag, as our way of saying ""Thank You"" for helping make our film possible.<br/>
</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <br/> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>Making films is always a risky venture, subject to several factors, including schedules, cast/crew availability, weather, and other factors. These can lead to delays in filming, as well as the release of the film. <br/><br/>However, as all of us working on the film are experienced actors and filmmakers, we have learned how to work around these issues, and will bring our expertise to making sure we finish <i>Our War</i> in a timely fashion, and are able to present it to several different film festivals.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>We understand that not everybody can donate to our campaign. And that is okay. There are other ways you can help our campaign. You can help by sharing the link to our campaign everywhere you can online.

However, as all of us working on the film are experienced actors and filmmakers, we have learned how to work around these issues, and will bring our expertise to making sure we finish Our War in a timely fashion, and are able to present it to several different film festivals.

<p>As with any film production, the excitement truly starts when we see the script coming to life. Apart from the usual planning and coordination, we spent a considerable amount of time designing each set, painstakingly sourcing and making the props ourselves. Following the demands of the script, we had to transform the bare multi-storey carpark into an enchanting garden for Ah Gong and Aiden. Take a peek!</p>

<p><b>BRITAIN - SHATTERED ISLES, STOLEN HISTORY</b></p>
<p><b>Britain's stolen history, and the Roman conspiracy to conceal a catastrophe... </b></p>
<p><i style=""background-color: initial;"">The
traditional view of world history is increasingly challenged as new
and surprising evidence surfaces globally - evidence which contradicts the simplistic time-lines promoted by academia. </i></p>
<p><i style=""background-color: initial;"">Conventional notions of history and religion, deliberately convoluted and confused, mould our
perceptions of the past and our very origins, distorting our ideas of the present and the future. </i></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Britain's
ancient history is obscure, to say the least. For example, we all know about 'Roman' roads... But when the Romans arrived in Britain to civilise the savage warring
tribes, these 'primitive' Britons were driving metal 'chariots' on
the long straight roads we are told were constructed by the Roman
invaders. </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">It appears that the islands of Britain in former times enjoyed a highly advanced civilisation. </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">So what happened to change that - and why is it such a big secret? </span></p>

<p>As <a href=""http://www.twelvearound1.com/youmeandtheapocalypse.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mason Bigelow</a> I've written a book about the lost history of Britain (I'm now working on another) and a play based on Comyns Beaumont's life of Francis Bacon as the secret son of Elizabeth I and the author of the plays of Shakespeare. </p>
<p>I've just finished a book of short stories based on my personal experiences of <a href=""http://www.snu.org.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">spiritualism</a><a href=""http://www.snu.org.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>, <a href=""http://www.rosacruz.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">rosicrucianism</a> and <a href=""http://www.memphis-misraim.us/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">freemasonry</a>, following on a traumatic and tragic accident which turned my world upside down and showed me a bigger picture. </p>
<p>I curate the <a href=""http://www.comynsbeaumont.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Comyns Beaumont Archive</a> with the Du Maurier family, and, through <a href=""http://www.resonancebookworks.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">RESONANCE BookWorks</a>, publish titles by Comyns Beaumont, J W Dunne and David Lindsay, along with books on related topics by well-known authors previously out of print, as well as works by new writers.</p>
<p>We also have a Puppet Museum with a Punch &amp; Judy Show, which might seem a wee bit incongruous, but when you watch the film you'll be surprised to see how many seemingly weirdly-placed dots actually do join up!</p>

<p>We have on board Dr John Hart from the National CV of Britain; Christopher Toyne - grandson of William Comyns Beaumont, the renowned pre-Velikovsky catastrophist uncle of Daphne Du Maurier; Igor Witkowski, the noted researcher into historical secret weapons programs, and sixties' icon Donovan, whose interest in Atlantis and Bacon's St Albans is legendary.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>BRITAIN - SHATTERED ISLES</b> is a massive story and a game-changing theory for history. The film
will explore Britain and its forgotten past in a journey
through ancient texts, hidden history and megalithic sites. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
The
catastrophe that shattered the great land mass of Hyperborea to form
the British Isles caused what has been referred to as 
“collective amnesia” -  a feeling of  loss for something we may
not consciously recall, but which lives on in every story ever told.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
The
rewriting of history after the Roman invasion deliberately obscured
the fascinating past of The British Isles, turning it eventually - and significantly - into the 'United Kingdom'.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
With
our own meticulous research and the help of many experts in the
ancient history of Britain our film will give a revealing view of the
past and present, showing how <i>and why</i> Britain's true history has
been hidden for 2,000 years.<b> </b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Most importantly, it will become clear just what this means geopolitically today.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">There
are those who have always known about this hidden past, but they cannot admit to the truth  <i>and</i>  preserve the status quo...</span></p>

Britain's stolen history, and the Roman conspiracy to conceal a catastrophe... 
The
traditional view of world history is increasingly challenged as new
and surprising evidence surfaces globally - evidence which contradicts the simplistic time-lines promoted by academia. 
Conventional notions of history and religion, deliberately convoluted and confused, mould our
perceptions of the past and our very origins, distorting our ideas of the present and the future. 
Britain's
ancient history is obscure, to say the least. For example, we all know about 'Roman' roads... But when the Romans arrived in Britain to civilise the savage warring
tribes, these 'primitive' Britons were driving metal 'chariots' on
the long straight roads we are told were constructed by the Roman
invaders. 
It appears that the islands of Britain in former times enjoyed a highly advanced civilisation. 
So what happened to change that - and why is it such a big secret? 

THE TEAM
Ingrid
Maclean 




I'm a linguist and former tutor now home educating my twin daughters and researching and writing about the origins and structure of language and its association with all that catastrophic history we don't get to see.
As Mason Bigelow I've written a book about the lost history of Britain (I'm now working on another) and a play based on Comyns Beaumont's life of Francis Bacon as the secret son of Elizabeth I and the author of the plays of Shakespeare. 
I've just finished a book of short stories based on my personal experiences of spiritualism, rosicrucianism and freemasonry, following on a traumatic and tragic accident which turned my world upside down and showed me a bigger picture. 
I curate the Comyns Beaumont Archive with the Du Maurier family, and, through RESONANCE BookWorks, publish titles by Comyns Beaumont, J W Dunne and David Lindsay, along with books on related topics by well-known authors previously out of print, as well as works by new writers.
We also have a Puppet Museum with a Punch & Judy Show, which might seem a wee bit incongruous, but when you watch the film you'll be surprised to see how many seemingly weirdly-placed dots actually do join up!

Mark
Windows



I
am a film-maker and researcher.  I also have a weekly show Windows on the World which covers the news not found in the mainstream. The
show was an instant hit on The People's Voice TV and has carried on covering ancient history and global
geopolitics, and giving a wider view of what is going on in the world. 



I
have been making documentaries, news features and even music videos
for quite some time. My first ever short documentary gets a mention
on the Walthamstow Wikipedia page. 



My
latest feature documentary is about legendary Shadows bassist Jet
Harris. The film is distributed by Wienerworld and has many five star
reviews.



I
like observational documentaries where the story comes from the
subjects rather than just a “what if..” or linear voice-over of
events. My documentaries reflect this, concentrating on the subjects
to create the narrative.







Our friends:
We have on board Dr John Hart from the National CV of Britain; Christopher Toyne - grandson of William Comyns Beaumont, the renowned pre-Velikovsky catastrophist uncle of Daphne Du Maurier; Igor Witkowski, the noted researcher into historical secret weapons programs, and sixties' icon Donovan, whose interest in Atlantis and Bacon's St Albans is legendary.

BRITAIN - SHATTERED ISLES is a massive story and a game-changing theory for history. The film
will explore Britain and its forgotten past in a journey
through ancient texts, hidden history and megalithic sites. 




The
catastrophe that shattered the great land mass of Hyperborea to form
the British Isles caused what has been referred to as 
“collective amnesia” -  a feeling of  loss for something we may
not consciously recall, but which lives on in every story ever told.



The
rewriting of history after the Roman invasion deliberately obscured
the fascinating past of The British Isles, turning it eventually - and significantly - into the 'United Kingdom'.



With
our own meticulous research and the help of many experts in the
ancient history of Britain our film will give a revealing view of the
past and present, showing how and why Britain's true history has
been hidden for 2,000 years. Most importantly, it will become clear just what this means geopolitically today.
There
are those who have always known about this hidden past, but they cannot admit to the truth  and  preserve the status quo...

BRITAIN - SHATTERED ISLES brings this dark history to light. It literally does change
your world.








Campaign:



Your
contribution will help way beyond the funding of the film. The story
we are presenting is  a game-changer and will reveal why our
history has been hidden, and what the aims of this very real historical
conspiracy really  are. 




If
you are interested in our lost heritage and the global geopolitical
agenda we see around us, your contribution will help reveal the nature of a plan centuries in the making, and the reason why it cannot be
allowed to continue.


This film is not only politically but philosophically
important; it reunites the British with their hidden past, showing in plain sight just how long history has been manipulated by the few to
control the many.

</div><div><span><p>«Lubovi Skotoprigonyevska» is an independent
non-profit full-length feature film based on <i>The Brothers Karamazov,</i> F. Dostoevsky’s last and most magnificent
novel. The action centers round the brothers Karamazov’s struggle with their
women, their passions and God. The detective line of the murder runs in the
background. In the foreground there is a love story of a teenage girl in a
wheelchair and Aleksey Karamazov, the youngest brother, who is torn apart by
his brothers’ passions and his brothers’ women, because they consider him to be an angel and
the only person able to help in their complicated relations. The film explores
the Human at the highest point of internal stresses and contradictions. In a
situation of choice and overcome by their passions, will these people forgive
each other and who will stay alive?</p>

<h3><b>Why it is important </b></h3></span><p></p>
<div>
<p>Dostoyevsky helps us to understand ourselves. At some point in life, all of us will meet a person who'll become important to us and the situation may not always be so simple. What should one do, and how is it possible to survive a betrayal? How can one overcome oneself without destroying the opponent? How can one overcome the pain, stay alive and forgive the other person? Keeping in touch with Dostoevsky’s characters we can change our souls and the world around us.</p>

What it’s all about 
«Lubovi Skotoprigonyevska» is an independent
non-profit full-length feature film based on The Brothers Karamazov, F. Dostoevsky’s last and most magnificent
novel. The action centers round the brothers Karamazov’s struggle with their
women, their passions and God. The detective line of the murder runs in the
background. In the foreground there is a love story of a teenage girl in a
wheelchair and Aleksey Karamazov, the youngest brother, who is torn apart by
his brothers’ passions and his brothers’ women, because they consider him to be an angel and
the only person able to help in their complicated relations. The film explores
the Human at the highest point of internal stresses and contradictions. In a
situation of choice and overcome by their passions, will these people forgive
each other and who will stay alive?



Why it is important 

Dostoyevsky helps us to understand ourselves. At some point in life, all of us will meet a person who'll become important to us and the situation may not always be so simple. What should one do, and how is it possible to survive a betrayal? How can one overcome oneself without destroying the opponent? How can one overcome the pain, stay alive and forgive the other person? Keeping in touch with Dostoevsky’s characters we can change our souls and the world around us.


Our project is international. And we hope that the number of people who help us will grow. 

Now Jan Eilhardt, an аlternative filmmaker from Germany, has joined us and he is willing to help us work on the script: Fire Natasha from Spain, who sings anything from opera to rock, plays the violin, is also with us: Franziska Junge, the beautiful actress from Berlin, involved in our project: We are supported by the musicians Laury Sommers and Liis Keerberg - authentic nature guys from Estonia:
Why donate

We have already started. The film is being shooting since September 2015. 

Our team is working without payment, dreaming of being linked to this great work and Dostoevsky’s genius. 





However, making a film is one thing.  Making a quality film is another, and they are largely separated by budget.  

We need this 96К USD to make the quality film, and even that will be cutting it close, but we are confident we can do it.  This is where the money will be allocated:

What happens if the campaign doesn't reach our goal?

Этот фильм откроет новый взгляд на великого автора и его ключевое произведение
О чем наш фильм?

«Любови Скотопригоньевска» - независимый некоммерческий полнометражный художественный фильм по мотивам последнего и самого удивительного романа Достоевского ""Братья Карамазовы"".  В центре событий  - борьба братьев Карамазовых с женщинами, со страстями, с Богом. Детективная линия убийства  проходит на заднем плане. На переднем - любовь девочки-подростка в инвалидном кресле и Алексея Карамазова, которого разрывают братья и их женщины, так как считают человеком ангелом, который один только может помочь в их сложнейших запутанных отношениях. Фильм исследует Человека в высочайшей точке его внутреннего напряжения и противоречий. В ситуации выбора и преодоления своих страстей. Смогут ли эти люди простить друг друга, и кто вообще останется жив? 


Почему это важно?

В жизни каждого происходят судьбоносные встречи, нам открывается великий дар любви. Но реальность не всегда наполнена радужными красками. Как пережить предательство близких? Как преодолеть боль и остаться самим собой? Как простить другого, переступив через свои принципы? Герои Достоевского помогают нам изменить и собственную душу и окружающий мир.

Наш проект международный. С каждым днем мы все больше и больше ощущаем поддержку совершенно разных людей со всех уголков планеты.

Совсем недавно к нам присоединился альтернативный кинорежиссёр из Германии Jan Eilhardt. Он готов помочь в работе над сценарием:

В нашей команде и Наташа из Испании - пламенная, страстная натура, голосу которой подвластны все жанры от оперы до рока, которая также удивительно и проникновенно играет на скрипке:

Franziska Junge, прекрасная актриса из Берлина, участвует в нашем проекте: 

Участники проекта - музыканты из Эстонии Laury Sommers и Liis Keerberg, тонкие ценители нетронутой в своей чистоте и первозданности Природы:


Мы просим поддержки!
Мы уже начали съемки. Работа над фильмом ведется с сентября 2015 года. 



Наша команда работает безвозмездно, вдохновленная возможностью прикоснуться к великому произведению бессмертного гения Достоевского.




Однако, снимать фильм это одно, а вот сделать в результате качественную профессиональную работу – совсем другое, и чтобы эти два полюса соединились, безусловно, потребуется определенный бюджет. 



Для завершения проекта нам необходимо 96 000$. И мы верим, что с помощью людей, которые разделяют нашу страсть, сможем это сделать. Вот как будет распределен бюджет: 



Представляем нашу команду:








Если цель проекта не будет достигнута, 
мы, несомненно, продолжим работать над фильмом и будем рады любой сумме, которую примем от вас с огромной признательностью! И конечно же, мы обещаем отблагодарить вас не только словами, но и выбранной вами наградой за спонсорскую поддержку!

</div></div>","SHORT SUMMARY


















He will be accompanied by several teams who will not interfere in the naturalness of the process, but will help him feel protected and open. At some point this journey will be like reality-show or a street musical, but the most important thing is the documentary story in which the hero will live here and now. A multimillion audience will be gathered after 10 days of regular live streams. And a little bit later the world of cinema will enrich itself with another story of genuine human values.






The authors of the film have personally experienced this state of mind to the full extent, but they managed to change their fate, breaking through what is predestinated and irresistible. 
Family history of Natalia and Anna, mother and daughter, became the basis of the script for a documentary ""House"". Now they together with their team are authors of a cycle of nostalgic genre projects: a series ""Farland"", a musical ""Escape!"", a historical reconstruction ""Fortezzo"". To help people who have lost touch with their homeland is the meaning of our service in the art. Writers, operators, designers gathered around us. obsessed with the same idea of making the world better.
    






Before we started this work we discussed all possible obstacles and project concepts. Being an expedition through a dynamic reality, our project is is rafting, so let us use it as a basis. And if we do not blow away all the obstacles, then we will just pass them. Our main goal is to pass all the rueful feelings straight to the spectator. Until this moment we never had a bad experience. But do we have an alternative course of action? Yes, we do. First is to sell the TV channels the right of public display. The second one is to gain support from Indian Embassy in Ukraine and to appeal for promotion of our Project in Indian diaspora all over the world, which is the second biggest diaspora in the world after a Chinese one– 25 million people. Besides, our character is a future diplomat, so it seems to us that his colleagues’ loyalty is free from risk.






Our journey has several important components. In the first place, it is our character’s live streams form different cities in India. On coming in contact with the place his soul comes to life – here is my school, I first threw myself into a skiey river here.Through feelings of a young Indian we walk through a great path from the ancient time to our days, we dive into a culture of India, we observe stories of rise and fall of empires, of big and proud cities. On this side of the screen, we all become brave travelers together with the young and fearless heart that burns with love to his two homelands. Victor becomes our guide into another world, mostly closed for the fair faced. A mystical and evanescent world. A saree of illusions of the young traveler will be softly unreeled.



NATALKA KORZHWriter and Director


If I ever get prohibited to generate ideas even for an hour, “tomorrow” will never come. Natalia got a film director education in the Kyiv National I. K. Karpenko-Kary Theatre, Cinema and Television University in 2006. By that time, she was a certified journalist by that time and was promoting an all-Ukrainian printed media. She conducted several investigations, visited some flash points as an analytics journalist. But her creative side came over the passion and bravery. Early International documentary festivals brought her prizes. A film-portrait “I will go back to my town” won the nomination “Movie about life” on the “Time Ribbon” Festival, and her film-reconstruction “Peresopnytsia Gospel” about creating the relic in the 15th century got “Litopys” gran-prix. People like Natalia are often called a God-given talent. They’ve got a unique talent to feel and reveal people, a unique skill to become a lifelong friend from first minutes. This is the pre-condition for Natalia being a portrait genre master in documentary film directing. «Half-Blood Prince Returns» is the most reverent project for Natalia since she is an author of a unique idea as well as its producer. Now it’s up to you to decide on the futurity of nostalgic trend in general, performed by a skydivefilm.com team, and on the consistency of this very project in particular.
ANNA KORZHWriter and Director
   Anna is a professional violinist and a film director. One can say she has a perfect pitch to human soul. This year she graduates the Kyiv National I. K. Karpenko-Kary Theatre, Cinema and Television University, and after that she wants to do the round world trip with a camera and to make notes from the most interesting places on Earth.  In 2016 Anna was elected as a member of student jury of DocuDays, international festival of documentary films. Being a curator of the program of documentary films in Public Association “CUC” (Contempоrary Ukrainian Cinema) Anna held unforgettable meetings with directors of fresh documentary masterpieces. Her own documentary “House” has seen almost all Europe and reached the heart of every spectator. The film is about life of a man, whose biography was complemented with a line of war, who lost his home. This is a deep tragedy about our present day country. As a director Anna couldn’t omit this topic, especially since she had personally experienced the pain.  This year Anna is going to represent her first fiction film “At The Depth”.
NATALIYA EDWARDSExecutive Producer
       Nataliya Edwards has produced and directed several independent films and web productions in the Ukraine, Kiev and New Mexico area. She has graduated from National University of Cinema and Television (Kiev, Ukraine, TV production-Director) and CNM College (certified in Film Crew Tech. and Post Production program). Talie is experienced in producing and directing a documentary film “A Smile Instinct“, where she had united two countries (USA and Ukraine) and investigated “where a smile came from?”.Last summer she traveled from NY, NY to Florida, Miami with a group of children from the folklore group “Golden gates” from Russia (San-Petersburg) and Georgia (Tbilisi). Through the Traditional Russian and Georgian songs, dances and music those kids opened their hearts and souls and showed them that it is necessary to live in Peace. The name of Documentary film where Talie is a Producer and a Director is “I want to Hug the World”.

PAVEL KOLCHYN Chief Cameraman



This ever-smiling man can be seen floating above the surface with a camera on support. The trick of levitation movements lies in an almost invisible hoverboard. Those familiar with this magical device know how hard it is to keep balance on it, but in our situation Pavel shoots on high speed and with marvelous accuracy.  Perhaps, this is due to a 20-year experience in film making and TV-production. Pavel can see the unusual in ordinary things. He does this equally professionally both with 8 cameras on PTS and with a single camera on a quadcopter. These skills laid a basis of his professional success and high demand in Poland, China, Sri Lanka, Georgia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Greece, and Croatia. He spent seven years studying psychology and human subconsciousness, and now he is teaching young cameramen to visualize illusions in a film school “World of Cinema”. His work was honoured with the Order of Saint George the Trophy Bearer of the second degree. Maybe art is a lie, but at the same time lie is a truth, Pavel suggests.
ALEXEY BAZANOVDesigner      A real magician of post-production. Compositing, animation, color correcting and titles – these are a small part of his professional skills. He began his career as a junior staff scientist at the Academy of Legal Sciences of Ukraine, developed and supported web-sites, published his research and even patented his own invention in the sphere of legal informatics.

<p>‘Forsaken’ will touch on a number of themes that we believe are highly relevant to our society at this time: neglect, radicalism and how the world would appear, should it become destroyed by a political regime . Through Jai, our protagonist, we will explore themes of isolation, perseverance and sacrifice. We’ll start with his character initially in a flashback sequence and then a number of years later throughout. Seeing how Jai changes not only physically but through the performance will hopefully convey how years under a regime and isolation has impacted him. With this we hope our audience can relate, in the sense of identifying how their own hardships have changed them, thus making our character accessible. We’ll use the robotic character of YL0 to create a relationship for Jai and to show that in times of isolation, our companions become those we sometimes overlook or least expect. This interesting dynamic between human and machine is built upon a number of nuances in the dialogue written throughout, but also through the cinematography and physical interaction too. Early in the film, Jai’s reason for staying on the planet is established as being the long search for his brother Kalen. This motivation is truly the ultimate driving force of the film’s narrative and Jai’s character arc. His perseverance to reach a defined end goal gives the story shape. It is also another element of the film that will connect our audiences to the story. We hope they will identify with sticking by something and being unrelenting in the hurdles that arise. Following this we’ll explore the idea of sacrifice, where through challenges in his journey, Jai will have to make decisions of what to let go of and how to cope with the loss of what has been ‘forsaken’. In wider relation to our own world, our film will also look at the repercussions of war, from some exploration of PSTD to the consequences on the environment itself. </p>

<h3>RISKS AND CHALLENGES </h3>
<p>We are very excited to be working on such an ambitious project with such an international team. However, we understand there are a number of challenges we face. Firstly we’ll be experiencing a cold Lithuanian winter that goes down to even -20°C degrees. Notably, a lot of our film is shot outdoors. Fortunately, with enough money raised we will be able to sufficiently provide our cast and crew(and even equipment!) with suitable means of warmth. Another challenge will be successfully finding the right faces for the characters we have on paper. No doubt through the extensive casting we have planned, we will be able to find actors who’s talents shine through. Yet with funding, we will look to really take care of them both through expenses and a great working relationship. Finally, we aim to construct every scene of the film with a precise attention to detail. No doubt this will be a challenge for the short time in which the shoot is allocated. However, funding will allow us to invest in extra time at the locations if needed. </p>

SHORT SUMMARY 

‘Forsaken’ will touch on a number of themes that we believe are highly relevant to our society at this time: neglect, radicalism and how the world would appear, should it become destroyed by a political regime . Through Jai, our protagonist, we will explore themes of isolation, perseverance and sacrifice. We’ll start with his character initially in a flashback sequence and then a number of years later throughout. Seeing how Jai changes not only physically but through the performance will hopefully convey how years under a regime and isolation has impacted him. With this we hope our audience can relate, in the sense of identifying how their own hardships have changed them, thus making our character accessible. We’ll use the robotic character of YL0 to create a relationship for Jai and to show that in times of isolation, our companions become those we sometimes overlook or least expect. This interesting dynamic between human and machine is built upon a number of nuances in the dialogue written throughout, but also through the cinematography and physical interaction too. Early in the film, Jai’s reason for staying on the planet is established as being the long search for his brother Kalen. This motivation is truly the ultimate driving force of the film’s narrative and Jai’s character arc. His perseverance to reach a defined end goal gives the story shape. It is also another element of the film that will connect our audiences to the story. We hope they will identify with sticking by something and being unrelenting in the hurdles that arise. Following this we’ll explore the idea of sacrifice, where through challenges in his journey, Jai will have to make decisions of what to let go of and how to cope with the loss of what has been ‘forsaken’. In wider relation to our own world, our film will also look at the repercussions of war, from some exploration of PSTD to the consequences on the environment itself. 

MISSION OBJECTIVE

In order to authentically present a world torn apart by war, access to a truly suited location is key. After a long location scout, we have chosen to shoot mainly in the countryside of Lithuania. Here we have a number of derelict settings at our disposal. We also have great connections and support from locals. Now here is where we need your help! Your donations will allow us to transport our sizeable crew and actors that are based in London, to Lithuania. We will also need to transport our equipment safely and securely.

Our robotic character is to be constructed as a fully functioning and flying drone, with detailed paint work to finish.
IMPACT

For ‘Forsaken’, we are looking to employ the skills of a VFX artist. We understand the power of special effects in the genre and hope to enhance key moments to be visually rich and powerful. Ultimately though, we are making a film rooted in practicality. This hopefully allows us to present the true grit of a post-war world but also let Jai’s character and story shine through. In terms of the off-screen impact, the film will be followed by a social media campaign, the foundations of which have already been laid. Prospectively we look to create a film that has the potential to be submitted to a number of film festivals internationally and allow our investors to be part of the success as executive producers. Please also note, we are very favourable of product placement queries and your opinions on the script.

<p><strong>What is it about?</strong> <i>Real Lemons</i> tells the story of two brothers in rural, conservative America. Hardened criminal Jesse, openly gay, ropes his high-spirited and naive younger brother John into committing a robbery. They both have something to gain from the money - John wants to win back his estranged ex-girlfriend, Jesse'd like to afford to live somewhere he's truly accepted - but you can't buy your way out of a rut.</p>
<p><strong>Who am I?</strong> My name's Julian Buchan and I am the co-writer and director of <i>Real Lemons</i>. I've been obsessed with films all my life and since first getting a taste of filmmaking on a feature documentary in 2012, I have been writing and directing my own narrative short films for the last 5 years. On top of that, I have directed, produced  and edited music videos, marketing reels and assisted a feature producer and a successful TV show-runner.</p>

<p><strong>Why Indiegogo?</strong> Crowdfunding evens out the playing field. It affords filmmakers, creators, inventors, who don't have access to huge funding, the means to realise their ideas and execute them at a high level. What's exciting about Indiegogo is that donors can see the impact they've made before their eyes. Not only is it an excellent platform for young filmmakers like myself, but it's also fantastic experience for the crew, great footage for the cast and could get the notice of film festivals and influencers.</p>
<p><strong>How much needs to be raised and where is the money going? </strong>We need to raise $21,000. ""What?! That's loads!"" Well..It is and it isn't! The truth is films aren't cheap. And in this industry money goes very quickly. You have to account for full insurance coverage, crew fees, cast fees, location hire, expensive equipment rental, costumes, props, post-production, music. All of these factors amount to the stunning array of cinema we have today. And, you know, it'd be nice to also make a living sometimes - so if we reach our target we can even pay our amazing team for their hard work. Y'know, rent and food and just the cost of living.</p>
<p><strong><i>BUT</i></strong> with Indiegogo it's completely doable!  A small contribution from lots of you rapidly adds up. Before you know it we'll have reached our target ! (And exceeded it you say??)</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>What's different about this film? </strong>What's different is that it is my first fully <strong>SAG approved </strong>film. This gives me access to truly talented actors who are part of the union. It also means the cast must be paid union-rates for their time and skill, and the pressure is <i>oooon </i>to deliver quality. And that's good for you because you're then guaranteed a great product.</p>
<p>It's important in today's political climate, where minorities threaten to be stripped of their freedom of speech and civil rights, that we continue to make films that challenge the status quo; films that try to understand what defines us and our behaviour, and who is accountable for our actions. This story hopes to contribute to that effort.</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Is it risky?</strong> Of course it is. You never know how something's going to turn out. We crowdfunded for the last short I directed, ANNA, and not only exceeded our target by $1500 but the film continues to be selected and screened at festivals more than a year later (no you cynics, these aren't more alternative facts, see for yourself: <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1303460128/anna-a-short-film-0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1303460128...</a>). So if past successes are anything to go by, it's a risk worth taking.</p>
<p><strong>What if we don't reach the target? </strong>Honestly, I can't let knockbacks like that get me down. None of the money donated will go to waste if we don't reach $21k. My team and I will make <i>some</i>thing great to give back to you. It may not be on the same scale but the priority here is making quality art.</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>What are the challenges and how will you overcome them? </strong>Locations could fall through, cast may get offers they can't turn down, crew may drop out. All of these things could happen. These factors have hindered the largest multi-million productions, but they get made anyway. Me and my devoted team are committed and assure you we can find a way to keep the show on the road. </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help. </strong>Even if you can't financially contribute, you can spread the word! Tell your friends and family, share on social media, recommend grants that may be interested in subsidising, recommend publications, podcasts, websites that may want to feature the campaign.

<h3>About the Film</h3>
<p>Cécile is a cinematic exploration of coming-of-age in an American circus after WWII. It follows the life of Cécile Lechance, a young French woman who is forced to replace her late mother in a dual trapeze act alongside her mourning father. Trying desperately to fit into American culture at the same time, Cécile struggles to balance her identity as a woman, a performer, and a daughter to a broken man. One day, she meets Jean, a Carnie transgender man working the ropes, and discovers the very change she's been searching for. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Circus Dreams </h3>
<p>This film was inspired by a real life introduction to the extravagant setting of a circus and the intriguing characters who continue to live within it. At a time of uncertainty and fight for acceptance, this film explores the heart of our current social struggles in the magic of a performance space and a post-war era. </p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>Why do we need your help? </h3>
<p>Script, crew, and most of the actors in place – we are now heading into pre-production and production. This means that every dollar you donate will directly help us cover the cost of: building the circus set, hiring talented crew, paying for location fees, work shopping scripts, casting actors, renting high-quality equipment, providing on-set catering, paying for music composition, and much more. </p>

<p>Our last film, ""Sasha,"" was made on a micro budget of only about $3,000 total! It was well-received in festivals and picked up awards for best actress, director, and cinematography. So if given the opportunity to fulfill our new vision with the necessary budget – you can trust us to deliver! </p>

We are looking to raise around $2000 for this production. We have other fundraising events planned and hope that this page can add to the small kitty we already have.
By donating you will have the chance to win perks such as film credits and take home props from the actual set!
Absolutely ALL revenue made from this page will be put towards the production, whether we make our goal or not.


The Impact

This project is important to me because it is a story that explores the truth of what it means to be family, both the good and the ugly side of it.
Between our talented crew there are a number of projects that we have worked on, however this will easily be one of our biggest challenges yet.
For you, it is the choice to donate a few dollars or not. For us, this is our graduate film, but more so it is our first attempt to create something truly special that we can be proud of and push to gain recognition in our field of work. For us, its everything we have been working for.


Risks & Challenges

Having Produced short film pieces before, I have experience with taking on such challenges but am always keen to learn from new experiences.
There is always a solution to every problem. The unfortunate thing is, most of those solutions cost money. Any donations that you can offer will be put to good use in order to solve problems and create high quality content.

<p><strong>Halloween. Pumpkins. Who cares? </strong></p>
<p><strong>I know I didn’t until a weird question popped into my head:</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What happens to pumpkins after Halloween?</strong></p>
<p><strong>The story quickly unfolded about a pumpkin living on the streets with a homeless man and it’s stuck with me for years. I would tell the story at dinner parties, around family at Christmas and even on a date once (my attempt at small talk). Seeing the genuine surprise and delight of people around me, reacting to his dark but sweet story, I decided to direct the film myself. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Last year, I wrote and co-directed The Green Light District, a short film about the optimistic outlook of real sex workers in Bristol. Seeing the BBC news coverage it was given, has made me hungry to make films that people will remember. Even on their deathbed. </strong></p>
<p><strong>For this project, I’m lucky enough to be joined by a team of film-making superheroes, including EasterEnders actor Tom Holloway, Americana musician Danni Nicholls and the husband and wife production team of Denis &amp; Timea Moldovan. They’ve been with me on this project for over a year and have been amazing every step of the way as we develop this little epic. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The Treatment</strong></h2>
<p><strong><i>I'm all for saving pumpkins</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>after all this is what princesses use to make into carriages</i></strong></p>
<p>These are the words of Tom Holloway's friend, Irina, after hearing about the film, which I thought was kind of beautiful. The Last Jack O’Lantern is a dark fairytale for modern times. Homelessness has replaced the dragon. The man living on the street, Adam, is a potential knight in shining armour and the beautiful princess is a plump pumpkin who survived Halloween.</p>
<p>And the focus and the way I will shoot the film is all about pumpkins. A world from their perspective. Instead of pumpkins being decorative, it will be people who will play that role in the film’s scenes.</p>
<p>You will see Christmas shoppers passing by Jack, the hero pumpkin and the homeless guy Adam. as well as revellers at Halloween parties in the ‘pumpkin rave' scene. But, in both scenes you will never see their faces. Other than the homeless man, people are on the edge of frame; they’re on periphery. For once, we enter in to a pumpkin’s world.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509287498/dvv2ho0meqyeknpihmla.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>It’s a cat and mouse world in Tom and Jerry.  The human face is never visible.</i></p>
<p>Our pumpkin hero Jack does not move on its own accord. It does not talk.  After all, ‘he’ is just a vegetable.</p>
<p>But, the way Adam cares for him. The way we shoot from the pumpkin’s perspective. And through music too. He comes alive.</p>
<p>I’m interested in the way people can feel for inanimate objects, especially through the magic of film. It’s worth checking out Spike Jonze’s ‘Lamp’. It’s a junk of metal, but you are heartless, if you don’t feel like rushing into the streets to give the lamp a home by the end of the advert.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509288850/bioi3owtp1v8jq7uaa50.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Throughout the Last Jack O'Lantern, we toy with the audience with the idea of magic realism. Is Jack actually alive?</p>
<p>The opening shot is our hero pumpkin with a winter hat on and a spare change cup in front of him. People ignore him, until eventually someone kindly drops him a few pennies. At this point, the homeless man’s hand comes in to frame to raise the cup in acknowledgment. We are back in a very real world. Is the pumpkin just a prop for the homeless man to get more money?</p>
<p>Later in the film, we go back in time to the day after Halloween- a scene we call pumpkin genocide. An elderly woman puts our hero pumpkin Jack in to her bin outside. We hold on the bin for a moment as time passes. As it begins to shake, we think this is a moment of Disney magic. The pumpkin is coming alive.</p>
<p>Well, when the bin rolls over and Jack rolls away to freedom (or at least the streets), we reveal it was actually a rowdy drunken couple going at it behind the bin.</p>
<p>And if my mum is reading this, I’m sorry. We will only show ankles. Nothing else.</p>
<p>In the original script, it was a raccoon that was responsible for shaking the bin, but you won’t believe how difficult it is to train a raccoon on a low budget without getting rabies.</p>
<p>Where you have to suspend your belief is that Jack’s facial expressions change between shots. That is how as a character he can have an emotional involvement in the story as he travels on a journey between dark and light.</p>

<p>It is after all a dark comedy. And these are the stories I love and want to make. In The Imitation Games, Alan Turin saves Britain in WW2 with the enigma code, but is arrested for simply being gay. It’s a tragic story and yet it is filled with charming comic moments that makes you skip to the next beat. La Vita Bella is an Italian film that goes from charming romance to holocaust, but it has comic moments in the darkest of places.  These films are my role-models. And if I haven't made you laugh and cry after you have watched the Last Jack O'Lantern, you can turn me into pumpkin soup. Or alternatively, write me strongly worded letter of complaint.</p>
<p>Okay, less about me and pumpkins. Let me introduce to you the team. Drum rolls, foot stamping please.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The Team</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Tom Holloway as Adam, the homeless guy</strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509291877/tllz0ztwsngiadrhvci5.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>First we have actor Tom Holloway from <strong>EastEnders</strong> and <strong>People do Nothing</strong> fame. His first big break was as the lead role in the American feature film <i>The Thompson’s</i> which premiered at Film 4’s Frightfest. He has since featured in the BAFTA award winning director Adrian Sitaru’s film <i>Cou</i><i>nterpart, as well as </i>the BAFTA nominated British comedy <i>People Just do Nothing </i>and playing Tom Eden in the BAFTA winning British soap<i> Eastenders</i>.  <strong>​</strong></p>
<p><i>“I was a Tim Burton fan when I first became interested in films, so the twisted fairytale theme interests me as well as the unlikely buddy love story going on between Jack a pumpkin and Adam, who we played with the idea was a soldier once praised by society but then let down and left on the streets. This unites him with Jack who was similarly idolised during Halloween but then left to literally roll down the street and rot.”​</i></p>
<p><strong>Jack Stalk as Jack the Pumpkin</strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509292350/mgdpxjn2erjxpmxz6am7.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Jack was raised on Barnbury farm. He never knew his biological parents, but he was adopted by Charles and Mary Stalk since he was a pip. In adolescence, he shunned the country life for the big bright lights of the city and got picked up by an agent. He has since featured in ‘Hocus Pocus’ and ‘Trick R Treat’, and won over the critics with his performances:</p>
<p><strong>The New Yorker</strong> – ‘Jack Nicholson watch your back. There’s a new Jack in town’</p>
<p><strong>Empire</strong> – ‘He lights up every film he’s in’</p>
<p><strong>Tom Holloway </strong>–  'He's an amazing method actor. He takes being a pumpkin quite literally.'</p>
<p>And In 2015, he was voted sexiest vegetable of the year by Farmer’s Market Monthly.</p>

<p>I’ve spent hundreds of pounds of my own money getting this short off the ground. 50 noble pumpkins have been sadly lost in the making of the Last Jack O’Lantern and I even tracked down the last pumpkin in Britain in a warehouse in February this year.

<p>We believe the film deserves to be cinematic, but the equipment is not cheap. We have so far used a Canon 5DMKIII and a Black Magic Micro camera, and we will be looking to hire a Panasonic GH5 alongside using an anamorphic adaptor to get that cinematic look and feel.

<p>Since there is no dialogue in the film, music and sound is even more crucial for telling our story, which is why we are investing £500 in to teaming up with the professional sound company Odyssey. And once the post-production is complete, we have high hopes of the Last Jack O’Lantern doing well on the festival circuit, which is why we are looking to initially invest £500 for festival entries.</p>
<p>We want to keep as much of the film ‘in camera’ as possible, but to make sure we can keep filming beyond pumpkin season we are lucky to be in the presence of a great CG artist in Ricza, who will CG a some of Jack’s expressions for us. The cost will run into the hundreds, but still at a fraction of the industry price.</p>

<h3> </h3>
</div></div>","Halloween. Pumpkins. Who cares? 
I know I didn’t until a weird question popped into my head:
What happens to pumpkins after Halloween?
The story quickly unfolded about a pumpkin living on the streets with a homeless man and it’s stuck with me for years. I would tell the story at dinner parties, around family at Christmas and even on a date once (my attempt at small talk). Seeing the genuine surprise and delight of people around me, reacting to his dark but sweet story, I decided to direct the film myself. 
Last year, I wrote and co-directed The Green Light District, a short film about the optimistic outlook of real sex workers in Bristol. Seeing the BBC news coverage it was given, has made me hungry to make films that people will remember. Even on their deathbed. 
For this project, I’m lucky enough to be joined by a team of film-making superheroes, including EasterEnders actor Tom Holloway, Americana musician Danni Nicholls and the husband and wife production team of Denis & Timea Moldovan. They’ve been with me on this project for over a year and have been amazing every step of the way as we develop this little epic. 
 
The Treatment
I'm all for saving pumpkins
after all this is what princesses use to make into carriages
These are the words of Tom Holloway's friend, Irina, after hearing about the film, which I thought was kind of beautiful. The Last Jack O’Lantern is a dark fairytale for modern times. Homelessness has replaced the dragon. The man living on the street, Adam, is a potential knight in shining armour and the beautiful princess is a plump pumpkin who survived Halloween.
And the focus and the way I will shoot the film is all about pumpkins. A world from their perspective. Instead of pumpkins being decorative, it will be people who will play that role in the film’s scenes.
You will see Christmas shoppers passing by Jack, the hero pumpkin and the homeless guy Adam. as well as revellers at Halloween parties in the ‘pumpkin rave' scene. But, in both scenes you will never see their faces. Other than the homeless man, people are on the edge of frame; they’re on periphery. For once, we enter in to a pumpkin’s world.

It’s a cat and mouse world in Tom and Jerry.  The human face is never visible.
Our pumpkin hero Jack does not move on its own accord. It does not talk.  After all, ‘he’ is just a vegetable.
But, the way Adam cares for him. The way we shoot from the pumpkin’s perspective. And through music too. He comes alive.
I’m interested in the way people can feel for inanimate objects, especially through the magic of film. It’s worth checking out Spike Jonze’s ‘Lamp’. It’s a junk of metal, but you are heartless, if you don’t feel like rushing into the streets to give the lamp a home by the end of the advert.

Throughout the Last Jack O'Lantern, we toy with the audience with the idea of magic realism. Is Jack actually alive?
The opening shot is our hero pumpkin with a winter hat on and a spare change cup in front of him. People ignore him, until eventually someone kindly drops him a few pennies. At this point, the homeless man’s hand comes in to frame to raise the cup in acknowledgment. We are back in a very real world. Is the pumpkin just a prop for the homeless man to get more money?
Later in the film, we go back in time to the day after Halloween- a scene we call pumpkin genocide. An elderly woman puts our hero pumpkin Jack in to her bin outside. We hold on the bin for a moment as time passes. As it begins to shake, we think this is a moment of Disney magic. The pumpkin is coming alive.
Well, when the bin rolls over and Jack rolls away to freedom (or at least the streets), we reveal it was actually a rowdy drunken couple going at it behind the bin.
And if my mum is reading this, I’m sorry. We will only show ankles. Nothing else.
In the original script, it was a raccoon that was responsible for shaking the bin, but you won’t believe how difficult it is to train a raccoon on a low budget without getting rabies.
Where you have to suspend your belief is that Jack’s facial expressions change between shots. That is how as a character he can have an emotional involvement in the story as he travels on a journey between dark and light.

It is after all a dark comedy. And these are the stories I love and want to make. In The Imitation Games, Alan Turin saves Britain in WW2 with the enigma code, but is arrested for simply being gay. It’s a tragic story and yet it is filled with charming comic moments that makes you skip to the next beat. La Vita Bella is an Italian film that goes from charming romance to holocaust, but it has comic moments in the darkest of places.  These films are my role-models. And if I haven't made you laugh and cry after you have watched the Last Jack O'Lantern, you can turn me into pumpkin soup. Or alternatively, write me strongly worded letter of complaint.
Okay, less about me and pumpkins. Let me introduce to you the team. Drum rolls, foot stamping please.
The Team
Tom Holloway as Adam, the homeless guy
First we have actor Tom Holloway from EastEnders and People do Nothing fame. His first big break was as the lead role in the American feature film The Thompson’s which premiered at Film 4’s Frightfest. He has since featured in the BAFTA award winning director Adrian Sitaru’s film Counterpart, as well as the BAFTA nominated British comedy People Just do Nothing and playing Tom Eden in the BAFTA winning British soap Eastenders.  ​
“I was a Tim Burton fan when I first became interested in films, so the twisted fairytale theme interests me as well as the unlikely buddy love story going on between Jack a pumpkin and Adam, who we played with the idea was a soldier once praised by society but then let down and left on the streets. This unites him with Jack who was similarly idolised during Halloween but then left to literally roll down the street and rot.”​
Jack Stalk as Jack the Pumpkin
Jack was raised on Barnbury farm. He never knew his biological parents, but he was adopted by Charles and Mary Stalk since he was a pip. In adolescence, he shunned the country life for the big bright lights of the city and got picked up by an agent. He has since featured in ‘Hocus Pocus’ and ‘Trick R Treat’, and won over the critics with his performances:
The New Yorker – ‘Jack Nicholson watch your back. There’s a new Jack in town’
Empire – ‘He lights up every film he’s in’
Tom Holloway –  'He's an amazing method actor. He takes being a pumpkin quite literally.'
And In 2015, he was voted sexiest vegetable of the year by Farmer’s Market Monthly.
“ I often get typecast for Halloween films, but when I read the script for the Last Jack O’Lantern, I thought this was a chance to expand my oeuvre in to another holiday: Christmas. Since I got the part, my film phone hasn’t stopped ringing. My agent has already had a phone call from the producers of Elf 3”  – Jack
Danni Nicholls - Music & plays the role of busker
She has one of the best voices I have ever heard live and it’s not just me who appreciates her music. Her Americana sound got her a nomination for UK album of the year at the Americana Music Association awards and her album Mockingbird Lane got air-time on the Bob Harris show on Radio 2.
'She effortlessly slips from smoky soul, folk-pop and heart-wrenching alt-country, all in a rich voice’ - Q magazine.
Danni also has an acting credit in the film as she plays the role of the busker in the opening and closing scene.  As this film doesn’t have any dialogue, music will be an incredibly powerful storytelling tool and each scene will be like miniature music video.

Timea & Denis Moldovan as Producer & DOP
Denis and Timea are a married production dream team, making films together for the last three years years. Together they have produced Timea's short 'Tingle' as well as working on promo videos for musician Akara Etteh and French Tuesdays. 
Paolo De Battista as 1st AD 
Paolo has worked on feature-length films Ride By and Cobra, as well as half a dozen short films in the UK. After coordinating large crowds and action sequences with car chases, helicopters, and explosions, pumpkins should not cause too many issues, hopefully!
Ricza Rahman - CG artist & Post
Ricza has recently graduated as a CG artist from Southampton Solent University. She previously worked on 3D architectural visualisation projects of hotels and also created a full CGI trailer for a horror game The Haunted House. 
The intention is to use real pumpkins throughout the film, but as we go past pumpkin season, creating CGI expressions will keep the film production going through winter and spring. 
Sound by Odyssey Production
Odyssey Audio Post Production started as a London based collective of sound designers and composers working in independent film. Since then they have grown into a flourishing small company producing sound and music for a variety of different platforms including their most recent venture into game audio with a nomination in audio design for The Bunker - starring Adam Brown (The Hobbit) & Sarah Greene (Penny Dreadful) at Tiga gaming awards late 2016. 
Will Grave - Writer and Director

<h3>The Film </h3>
<p><i>Departure</i> takes place over the course of one late-Spring day. Throughout the film, we see the events of the day repeated four times through the eyes of each one of the film’s four central characters.</p>

<p>Anne is a headstrong and impulsive seventeen year old. When it becomes clear that certain secrets she’s kept from her parents are about to come to light, she takes matters into her own hands to protect her future and leave her family behind.</p>

<p>Emily is a dutiful police officer with a short fuse who obsesses over taking care of her aging mother. Her patience wears thin as she deals with her sister’s family’s issues, her stressful job, and her mother’s deteriorating state.</p>

<p>We are four filmmakers from the US, Turkey, Iran, and Colombia. We’ve spent two years writing, directing, and editing <i>Departure</i> under the careful mentorship of acclaimed filmmaker and Ohio Eminent Scholar in Film, Rajko Grlic. We are excited to finish this film in the coming months so we can put it in front of audiences around the world.</p> <p>When we first pitched the idea, many people told us they thought there was little chanced we’d actually make this film, much less that we would remain friends throughout the process. A film with four writers and directors was a ridiculous idea to most, but we’ve found a way to make our different perspectives work for us instead of against us (and we’re happy to report that we do in fact still like each other).</p> <p>The four of us have bonded throughout this process because of our diverse backgrounds. Our vast experiences have enabled us to see the world through different perspectives, but moreover, they have shown us what it is that binds us all together as humans. <i>Departure</i> has been the ideal vehicle through which we can explore how people view the world differently and ultimately how connected our lives are.</p>

Departure takes place over the course of one late-Spring day. Throughout the film, we see the events of the day repeated four times through the eyes of each one of the film’s four central characters.
 
ROBERT - YANG MILLER 

Robert is a husband and father who generally avoids the responsibilities of family life. On this day, he must confront his recklessness when he realizes his neglectful actions have taken a dangerous toll on his family.
ANNE - EMILY KEEFE


Anne is a headstrong and impulsive seventeen year old. When it becomes clear that certain secrets she’s kept from her parents are about to come to light, she takes matters into her own hands to protect her future and leave her family behind.
EMILY - PARIS PERRAULT 


Emily is a dutiful police officer with a short fuse who obsesses over taking care of her aging mother. Her patience wears thin as she deals with her sister’s family’s issues, her stressful job, and her mother’s deteriorating state.
LORETTA - ABBY EILAND


Loretta feels like an outsider in her own home. No one in her family appears to show any concern for her—not Robert, Anne, or Emily. However, her drastic decision sends shock waves through the entire family.
 
Who are we?


We are four filmmakers from the US, Turkey, Iran, and Colombia. We’ve spent two years writing, directing, and editing Departure under the careful mentorship of acclaimed filmmaker and Ohio Eminent Scholar in Film, Rajko Grlic. We are excited to finish this film in the coming months so we can put it in front of audiences around the world. When we first pitched the idea, many people told us they thought there was little chanced we’d actually make this film, much less that we would remain friends throughout the process. A film with four writers and directors was a ridiculous idea to most, but we’ve found a way to make our different perspectives work for us instead of against us (and we’re happy to report that we do in fact still like each other). The four of us have bonded throughout this process because of our diverse backgrounds. Our vast experiences have enabled us to see the world through different perspectives, but moreover, they have shown us what it is that binds us all together as humans. Departure has been the ideal vehicle through which we can explore how people view the world differently and ultimately how connected our lives are.

<h3><strong>Director's Statement</strong></h3>
<p>""<i>Blueberries</i> is the most personal script I’ve ever written. It’s inspired by my experience of witnessing my mother take care of my grandmother with Alzheimer’s. This disease has affected my family immensely and I will portray it as honestly as possible. <i>Blueberries</i> will be filmed entirely in Senatobia and Como, MS. My home state has been the backdrop for every short film I’ve written and directed because they’re all inspired from my real life experiences. I feel that the best way to do my senior thesis film justice is to shoot it in my hometown, in the real locations that inspired the story. Mississippi’s neighboring states have benefited greatly from a booming film industry. Although a short film doesn’t provide as much of an economic boost to a community as a big budget feature film, I hope to help inspire other filmmakers to bring their projects to the beautiful Magnolia State.""</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Welcome to Kegland!</h2>
<h3>Hello Fellow Keggies,</h3>
<p><i><strong>Killer Keg</strong></i> is the new horror comedy from indie director Brad Leo Lyon (Little Creeps/Monsters on Main Street/Roommates) filming this winter on the Sun Coast of Florida. It's Groundhog Day meets Happy Death Day as a group of friends decide to throw a kegger to cheer up a friend after his girlfriend dumps him. Problem? Well, the mysterious keg they find for the party causes them to relive the same day over and over again and with each new day another person disappears. </p>

<p>We're the team behind such movies as <strong><i>Little Creeps</i></strong> which starred <strong>Dustin Diamond</strong> and <strong>Lark Voorhies</strong> of <i>Saved By the Bell</i>, the late great horror icon <strong>Robert Z'Dar</strong>, WWE Hall of Fame member <strong>Jake the Snake Roberts</strong>, and the legendary <strong>Joe Estevez</strong>.  We also created <i><strong>Monsters on Main Street</strong></i> featuring <strong>Todd Bridges</strong> (Diffrent Strokes), <strong>Martin Klebba</strong> (Pirates of the Caribbean 1-3, 5), and <strong>Robert Z'Dar</strong> again. In total, director Brad Leo Lyon has been a credited producer on over 30 movies and TV episodes which starred many legends of cinema like <strong>Tony Todd</strong> (Candyman/Final Destination), <strong>Robert Miano</strong> (Fast &amp; Furious/Dungeons and Dragons), <strong>Kane Hodder</strong> (Yes, Jason from Friday the 13th),  music artists like <strong>Bone Crusher</strong>, and UFC legends like <strong>Dan Severn</strong>.  </p>

<p>Our team, along with a bunch of awesome people from Florida and beyond, are coming together to make this insanely fun movie. We have a budget to make the movie, but we could make a heck of a lot better one with your help! The particular area where we're filming doesn't have an infrastructure for film which means it's not rich with experienced and highly trained crew or cast. Many more people are going to have to be brought in from out of the area and placed in hotels than originally budgeted for. That's where you come in, we're offering you some crazy perks to help us make this movie the best it possibly can. With your help we can bring in the additional crew and cast we need, create a few sets we're lacking, and even cast some exciting celebrities you'll love to see pop up in the film.</p>

</div><div>
<p>We might sound like a broken record here but what we're striving to do is increase the budget of our film so we can make a better movie. We need to increase our budget for lodging, travel, and create a budget to build a couple sets. These are our primary goals and what we need to reach the minimum of $18,000 in order to do. This budget also takes into account funds we'll need to actually fulfill the perks being purchased here plus IndieGoGo's fees (5%), credit card service fees (roughly 2.9%), and a 5% reserve fee they hold. The perks are the fun part!</p>
<p>We're not just asking you to help, we're inviting you to become part of the film! You can actually visit the set, appear in the film, get credited as a producer and much more. It's a pretty exciting opportunity to be party of a film family and actually experience making a movie from the inside of the set. As a matter of fact, everyone who contributes will get to be part of our private, secret group where we'll share updates, stories, photos, and video journals about our experience making the movie.</p>
<p>If we make it to some of our stretch goals we're even going to make a documentary about the making of this movie where EVERYONE who participated in the film can come be a part of. But, let's not get ahead of ourselves first.</p>

For instance, your beer bottle with your logo visible may be sitting on a table cast member(s) are sitting at while having a conversation. Don't have a physical product? That's okay! We'll place an advertisement conveniently but not too discreetly into a seen. Perhaps your advertisement is visible in a fake open magazine or table advertisement sits on the table in a coffee shop. Heck, maybe your business card is seen in the room of one of the actor's homes. We'll make it happen!  The scene will be shot during principal photography in 2019 but will not be available to be seen until the film's premiere which is estimated to be October of 2020 but that date is subject to change without notice.

Other areas of Florida and even other states are available at an additional cost. If you're in another state just comment or email us and we'll see if we can work it out. This is open to any business although coffee shops, restaurants, and/or bars could receive extended time on screen due to being an ideal fit for scene(s) of our film.

You'll be fully credited as an Associate Producer in the opening credits of the movie and on IMDB. Bragging rights don't get much better. </span>
</li>
<li>
<strong>BECOME AN EXECUTIVE PRODUCER</strong> - Remember when we said bragging rights don't get much better? You know, literally right before this sentence? Well this is the one exception. You'll be credited in the opening credits of the film, on the movie's poster, and in the trailer as Co-Executive Producer. This is the king of all credits, the Executive Producer is the highest title on the film set. Time to wear your crown. </li>

Because director Brad Leo Lyon will come TO YOU and screen the movie for you and your friends so all of them can see YOU are credited as a CO-Executive Producer in the opening credits of the movie, on the poster, and in the trailer. You'll also get to visit set, meet the cast and crew, have lunch with everyone, and get a special prize. Not to mention you're going to be loaded up with all kinds of swag from the film. You'll even get to attend the premiere of the movie with 5 of your friends and family. (Travel and Accommodations are not provided, but we are paying for ourselves to get to you for the private screening.)</li>

<p>Lyon Productions (the motion picture company making this movie) and director Brad Leo Lyon have produced numerous feature films and TV episodes. So getting this film made isn't a risk. But making a great film has its challenges. Major motion picture studios make movies for millions of dollars. Did you know one of the film unions, which we'll leave nameless here, considers a film a low budget starting under 2.5 million dollars. So making an awesome movie on a shoe string budget is difficult.</p>
<p>The great part here is we're helmed by a director who does this for a living. He's produced dozens of films and has directed numerous movies that have shot in a fraction of the time normal ""Hollywood"" movies are made while still being cinematic and entertaining.</p>
<p>Yet, we won't deny money does help a lot. So the better budget we have, the better movie we will make. We, meaning all of you who are joining us here in Kegland along with our great team of people already apart of making cinematic history with us.</p>

This will be a weekend date in December, prior to the Holidays, or just following the Holidays in the Charlotte County, Florida area.) 

INSANE ACTOR MEGA PACKAGE - You're getting a huge boost to your dreams of becoming an actor with this mega pack - Attend our Master Class, have your headshot made, get a speed actor's reel shot & edited, go to dinner with the director, receive a walk on role as an extra, and even get a special thanks credit on IMDB and in the end credits of the film! (Travel & Lodging provided by the Purchaser)

YOUR PRODUCT ON SCREEN - Your product, business, or service will be visually seen on screen in a scene of the film. For instance, your beer bottle with your logo visible may be sitting on a table cast member(s) are sitting at while having a conversation. Don't have a physical product? That's okay! We'll place an advertisement conveniently but not too discreetly into a seen. Perhaps your advertisement is visible in a fake open magazine or table advertisement sits on the table in a coffee shop. Heck, maybe your business card is seen in the room of one of the actor's homes. We'll make it happen!  The scene will be shot during principal photography in 2019 but will not be available to be seen until the film's premiere which is estimated to be October of 2020 but that date is subject to change without notice. (Any product is to be supplied to the production at no cost. Placement of the product, service, or advertisement is up to the sole creative decision of director Brad Leo Lyon. There is no guarantee of the length of screen time.) . {A contract will be supplied giving us the rights to use your company's logo, likeness, and/or other marketing related material in the film.}

YOUR PRODUCT INTERACTED WITH - Your product, business, or service will be directly interacted with on screen. Remember that beer bottle mentioned above? Now picture it being picked up by an actor in the film, enjoyed on screen with a nice big moan of satisfaction when the bottle is sat back down. We might even say the name of your product or business right on screen! (Any product is to be supplied to the production at no cost. Placement of the product, service, or advertisement is up to the sole creative decision of director Brad Leo Lyon. There is no guarantee of the length of screen time.) . {A contract will be supplied giving us the rights to use your company's logo, likeness, and/or other marketing related material in the film.}

FILMED ON LOCATION - Own a business you'd love to see in the movie? We have a montage scene in our film that would be perfect to include your business advertised directly on screen. You & or part of your staff may even get to appear as extras in the scene! This is available to Florida area businesses preferably in Southern Florida (Southwest is ideal) but we can work out most locations with a couple hour drive of the Punta Gorda/Port Charlotte area. Other areas of Florida and even other states are available at an additional cost. If you're in another state just comment or email us and we'll see if we can work it out. This is open to any business although coffee shops, restaurants, and/or bars could receive extended time on screen due to being an ideal fit for scene(s) of our film. (Length of time on screen is up to the sole discretion of the director in relationship to his vision of the editing and pacing of the movie.) 

A WALK ON ROLE - You, YES YOU, will get to be in the movie! You'll get to visit set and appear as an extra in the movie. Remember, this is a movie that involves a time loop so you may even be seen several times. (travel and accommodations are not included)

SPEAKING ROLE - Actors go on dozens of auditions competing  with hundreds of actors for a chance at a speaking role. You just landed one with one click. You'll get an actual speaking role in the movie with dialog written for you specifically by director Brad Leo Lyon. You'll have to sign a contract of course. That means you'll be coming to set, eating with the cast and crew, and getting to talk in the movie. You'll be fully credited for your role in the movie in the end credits of the film and on IMDB.

BE A PRODUCER - The top people on set are the producers. When a movie wins best picture, it's the producers who are awarded the title. The only way you could be credited any higher on the movie is if the word executive came before the word producer. You'll be fully credited as an Associate Producer in the opening credits of the movie and on IMDB. Bragging rights don't get much better. 


BECOME AN EXECUTIVE PRODUCER - Remember when we said bragging rights don't get much better? You know, literally right before this sentence? Well this is the one exception. You'll be credited in the opening credits of the film, on the movie's poster, and in the trailer as Co-Executive Producer. This is the king of all credits, the Executive Producer is the highest title on the film set. Time to wear your crown. 

THE ULTIMATE KEGSPERIENCE (Keg Experience) - This is an insane opportunity to truly show off to your friends and family that you're a real producer on the film? How you ask? Because director Brad Leo Lyon will come TO YOU and screen the movie for you and your friends so all of them can see YOU are credited as a CO-Executive Producer in the opening credits of the movie, on the poster, and in the trailer. You'll also get to visit set, meet the cast and crew, have lunch with everyone, and get a special prize. Not to mention you're going to be loaded up with all kinds of swag from the film. You'll even get to attend the premiere of the movie with 5 of your friends and family. (Travel and Accommodations are not provided, but we are paying for ourselves to get to you for the private screening.)
 


Lyon Productions (the motion picture company making this movie) and director Brad Leo Lyon have produced numerous feature films and TV episodes. So getting this film made isn't a risk. But making a great film has its challenges. Major motion picture studios make movies for millions of dollars. Did you know one of the film unions, which we'll leave nameless here, considers a film a low budget starting under 2.5 million dollars. So making an awesome movie on a shoe string budget is difficult.
The great part here is we're helmed by a director who does this for a living. He's produced dozens of films and has directed numerous movies that have shot in a fraction of the time normal ""Hollywood"" movies are made while still being cinematic and entertaining.
Yet, we won't deny money does help a lot. So the better budget we have, the better movie we will make. We, meaning all of you who are joining us here in Kegland along with our great team of people already apart of making cinematic history with us.

<p>I’m Ella, an 18 year old Londoner, and the producer &amp; writer of the film! After having worked as an actor for many years, I decided that I wanted to create and share something of my own.

<h2> The Impact</h2>
<p>My project will help to shine light on some of the issues faced by teens and to hopefully make these issues seem less daunting and isolating. I want to keep an important conversation going beyond the end of the film. I love films because they bring people together, and can impact people in so many different ways. By supporting the film, you're not only supporting a great team of cast &amp; crew, but also important characters with an inspiring message to tell.</p>
<p>I have got to witness firsthand the production of different short films, including my experience as the lead roles in the films 'Before Nightfall' and 'In Front of You'. Getting to see people bring their vision to life inspired me and created a passion for me to want to do the same. </p>
<p>I will continue to post information, pictures, &amp; trailers on film's social pages so that you can see the effect of your contribution and follow along with the production journey.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>We want to make sure that we tell the story as well as we can to enable us to reach as wide an audience as possible. We want to hire a post-production team that really understands the vision and does the crew's hard work justice. We need to allow for any last minute cancellations or equipment problems.</p>
<p>As someone with experience in seeing productions just like this happen before, I know that not all issues can be avoided but I am extremely organised, work well under pressure and have the motivation to ensure that this shoot will be a success.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>I want to reach as many people as possible and so sharing the campaign page, following the film on Twitter and Instagram, and even talking about the film will help so much. </p>
<p>I'm passionate that this film can be enjoyed by all different audiences and has a message that everyone needs to hear.</p>

<h3>Telling Ryan Road Story.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hello possible contributors, Tyler Geis here. Writer/Producer and Director of Ryan Road Story. After years of making feature films for very little money and a few short films, producing a web series', and working for network television, it's time to roll the dice again. I present to you the campaign to fund Ryan Road Story. The plot of the film is simple. It's about a filmmaker who returns home from Hollywood after hearing of the tragic passing of his brother who had his struggles with drugs. It's a project the team and i have had in the works for almost four years now. For me, I'm close to this story. I plan to film this in my hometown. Matter of fact, the neighborhood i grew up in is the bulk of the filming locations. But more importantly the plot hits home to me. And I'm sure it hits home to a lot of people near and far. By taking part in funding this project you will be bringing to life something that explores universal themes that we all can connect with.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> The more you donate, the more of an integral part you get to be on this project. Yes, there's t-shirts to give away, digital downloads of the finished film, DVD's, posters, maybe even some cool little props that will appear in the film. But we also offer perks that range from your name in the end credits all the way up to Executive Producer credit. That's right, even if you've never been apart of making a film, but you have always wanted to have a stake in one. You have a chance to get the credit upon a very generous donation to the project. This film has a lot of things lined up already. Cast, crew, locations, some gear. But day in and day out, things can get costly. Your donations will be helping keep us afloat through production and into post production as well.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>More Than A Movie</h3>
<p>We could have made this film a few years back. But what we needed just wasn't there. We needed to dive deeper. I needed to dive deeper. The film always had the plot of a family dealing with a tragic loss of one of their members. But it never was at the forefront of the story. As i mentioned in the video that goes along with this campaign, i have lost track of how many people i grew up with who were either a friend, or just someone i would hear about, that has had to deal with an addiction to drugs. I know so many families that have had to deal with losing one of their own to drugs. So for me, personally, I'm trying to make this film for them. So with your donation to push this project forward. You're helping a story get told that people all over can sympathize with.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Fortune Favors the Bold</h3>
<p>This film has been a challenge from day one. Writing, Casting, coming close to filming then having to halt things. I live in another state from the rest of my cast and crew. But all challenges aside, everyone who's involved with this has wanted to lift this off the ground for some time now. Your support and help really makes it stand up. Filmmaking is hard, ask anyone who has ever tried it. And sometimes it's almost safe not to create something this close to you. But the fact that it is very close to a lot of us involved with it, means we're going to take good care of the integrity of the project despite whatever challenges come our way.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute. This isn't our first crowdfunding campaign. We understand people have to live within their means. So if you can't make a contribution out of the gate or even at all. We want you to show this off to the people you know as well.  The message this film conveys has universal appeal because it deals with very human problems that aren't looked at in a judgemental way. Share it on social media, but please have a caption on your post so people just don't keep scrolling. We want this project funded but we also want the word out as well. If you see this and feel a strong connection to the material and get the urge to want to reach out, please do so. The more movement we get around this project, the more closer it gets to being made.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for reading and watching.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>“A rhythmic short film which expresses the impact everyday life has on a newly diagnosed coeliac, and how she discovers her own tempo.”</p>
<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Holly, an Irish woman newly diagnosed with coeliac disease has to suddenly say goodbye to all things gluten for, well... forever. The sudden lifestyle change takes her on a turbulent journey; With a mix of frustrating times, a splash of envious times and a sprinkling of lighthearted times. <span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Supermarket shopping, social gatherings, reminiscing and everyday prep. Will she take it all in her stride?</span></p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This is a topic that could quite easily be boring, which is why an inventive approach is essential. It’s not a ‘feel sorry for me, I have coeliac disease’ film; it’s an immersive and creative film which highlights various important factors. The short will be carried by strong rhythmic sound design and fast paced inventive editing. Basing it upon rhythm reflects the planning and incessant vigilance a coeliac must take. </p>
<h3>Directors Attachment</h3>
<p>6 months ago, I was diagnosed with coeliac disease. When the doctor saw the flattened villi in my gut, he told me I have probably had it for years. Although it would have been good if it were diagnosed sooner, much of my twenties involved working &amp; travelling the world, downing copious amounts of beer whilst trying any food without having to worry about language barriers and understanding labels.  Things have changed for me now, and for many with coeliac disease, it involves much planning and many sacrifices. </p>
<p>Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disease which destroys your gut due to antibodies being produced at the presence of even a tiny crumb. A gluten free diet for life is the only medication.  Gluten is found in wheat, rye, spelt and barley - which is in more food and drink than you'd expect! A coeliac never wants to be branded fussy or complicated and research shows that most will avoid social situations like eating out due to concerns over cross-contamination. </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">I aim to help the one percent of the population with coeliac disease who sometimes feel misunderstood, by making something which people without the disease can connect with in an insightful and enjoyable way.</span></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This is a self initiated project and I need all the help I can get. Luckily I have managed to talk my way into getting some stuff for free, like crew, however unfortunately there are still additional things that need to be covered. These are locations, kit hire, props/costume, cast and crew travel and food expenses, talent, composer, post-production assets, distribution / film festivals around the world. </p>
<p>If I don’t manage to raise the full amount, I will still make what I can, just a simplified version. If I successfully reach more than the aim, I will donate it to CoeliacUK towards medical research.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>At least one percent of the population are living with coeliac disease. Awareness has got a lot better in recent years, however, many coeliacs still feel misunderstood. Making this film aims to have a voice for the coeliacs and connect the people who haven’t heard of it, understand it better. Then from the audience getting more of an emotional connection to the disease, I hope it encourages them to look into and research the disease further.</p>
<p>Sometimes communicating something verbally to someone won't have the same impact as them watching and experiencing a subject through storytelling, vision and sound. </p>
<p>I’ve seen funny coeliac or gluten free videos, and the more scientific informative videos on the subject, but not one like this yet.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>A TOTAL BUDGET OF <strong>$500,000.00</strong> or AIM FOR MORE we would be aiming to shoot in IRELAND and the United States! </li>
<li>
<strong>5%</strong> -$25,000.00 or MORE - Investing includes a formal contract and attachment as an Executive Producer Role. This includes producer points to be discussed with production team, flight and hotel stay for a week or less during location scout, and camera rehearsals and/or production on the film location if out of the United States in Ireland. The percentage of distribution ownership of profit to be discussed in person. The percentage of profit within theatrical/online distribution to be discussed with production team. This also includes attending post production sessions, when film is in post. The investor will be able to attend the premier and attend the wrap day.  The investor also receives credit within the feature film, in the rolling credits. The investor will receive also a prop from the feature film.</li>
<li>
<strong>2%-4%</strong> - $10,000.00-$20,000.00 - Investing includes a formal contract and select producer points of ownership of product of film given to a low budget producer. Attendance of the investor to set for one day, if filming in the United States. They will receive a copy of final product and credit in the feature film/rolling credits.

<li>If we do not reach our final goal...which we will! But if we don't, where does the money go!??The production team would open an account it would just be put into a starter fund for the feature film for THE OTHERKIND, for pitching to or towards talent involvement and/or companies with or in reach of funding for future developments of the feature film production of THE OTHERKIND. </li>

</ul>
</div><div>
<p>TOTAL: $460,000.00</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>How will this make an impact on film?</li>
<li>WE WANT TO CHANGE THESE PROMINENT STATISTICS.</li>
<li>The statistics of Women accounted for in 2019 8% of directors, down 3 percentage points from 11% in 2017. This is 1 percentage point below the 9% achieved in 1998. By role, women comprised 16% of writers, 21% of executive producers, 26% of producers, 21% of editors, and 4% of cinematographers.</li>
<li>You will be impacting and helping the percentage of female directors get films made in addition to changing the statistic of the amount of female directors actually working. We are specifically aiming within genre filmmaking. I want to have a 50% by 50% crew talent and crew, having gender equal pay rolls on set. </li>
<li>In addition for being an advocate for equal opportunity and equal pay. I think this film is a strong political statement on how communities or towns can be affected by information. As to why the aliens invade and manipulate the people within Ireland around a lake/lough. There is a strong point being made behind this film. </li>

<li><strong>POST PRODUCTION: AUGUST/SEPTEMBER 2020</strong></li>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risks, I am facing will be Marketing, finding the right crew local to Ireland for the right project and hiring on the right production team to make this big project happen for us! </p>
<p>I have been pitching this feature for about three years going now. It's time to make it, low budget or mid budget.<b> Time to put in the work. :) </b></p>

The Impact
 

How will this make an impact on film?
WE WANT TO CHANGE THESE PROMINENT STATISTICS.
The statistics of Women accounted for in 2019 8% of directors, down 3 percentage points from 11% in 2017. This is 1 percentage point below the 9% achieved in 1998. By role, women comprised 16% of writers, 21% of executive producers, 26% of producers, 21% of editors, and 4% of cinematographers.
You will be impacting and helping the percentage of female directors get films made in addition to changing the statistic of the amount of female directors actually working. We are specifically aiming within genre filmmaking. I want to have a 50% by 50% crew talent and crew, having gender equal pay rolls on set. 
In addition for being an advocate for equal opportunity and equal pay. I think this film is a strong political statement on how communities or towns can be affected by information. As to why the aliens invade and manipulate the people within Ireland around a lake/lough. There is a strong point being made behind this film. 
TEMP TIMELINE: 

PRE-PRODUCTION: DECEMBER/JANUARY 2019-MAY2020

PRODUCTION: JUNE/JULY 2020
POST PRODUCTION: AUGUST/SEPTEMBER 2020


Risks & Challenges
The risks, I am facing will be Marketing, finding the right crew local to Ireland for the right project and hiring on the right production team to make this big project happen for us! 
I have been pitching this feature for about three years going now. It's time to make it, low budget or mid budget. Time to put in the work. :)

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Two Birds in a Cage is about a young Gay man, Connor, hiding his sexuality in a deeply Catholic region of Australia. Living in a homophobic town with his equally homophobic family, Connor finds himself completely alone in his struggles... Until he finds the courage to take a leap of faith and confide in his best friend, and first love, Sean.</p>
<p>But with the eyes of the small, homophobic community constantly watching, it's not long before the couple are seen being intimate, and words spreads. Eventually, this leads to a gang of men, most likely led by Connor’s father, Rob, abducting Sean and dragging him to an outlying field where they beat him and leave him to die.</p>
<p>After a desperate search Connor finds him just in time... Or does he?</p>

She has the perfect balance of the creative aspect and the business aspect of the job and as a result can produce anything to the highest degree.</p>
<p><br/><i>Producer’s statement:</i><br/>“I found Harry’s take on a topical story very intriguing, there are a lot of issues in this film that<br/>will have their light shed, coming from a family that have first hand experienced a lot of the<br/>main themes to the story, I have a great understanding of the characters.

<h3>What is this story about?</h3>
<p>Dating has changed a lot over the years but it still comes down to a simple thing – two people, sitting across from each other, and how they get along. How their hearts speak to one other – or not! Making a connection is no easier when you are, ahem, over a certain age. In fact, sometimes it seems, the older you get, the crazier your dates become.</p>
<p>This short film is about two people who have met online and now meet for real. Does the promise of the online profile hold up in person? Let’s see what happens.</p>
<h3>Why should you contribute?</h3>
<p><strong>Support women filmmakers!</strong> Our writer, director, producers, and editor are all women. Women are still underrepresented in key positions in the film industry. Let’s change that, one film at a time. Not that we are excluding men – there are still plenty of dudes contributing both in front of and behind the camera on this film.</p>
<p><strong>Support women in comedy!</strong> Again, women are underrepresented in the comedy world. And we are funny, darn it! Let’s change the world, one laugh at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Support diversity in filmmaking!</strong> We have a very diverse cast and crew. Greater diversity of people means a greater diversity of ideas. This is what our world looks like. This is what our entertainment should look like.</p>
<p><strong>Support…..age diversity in filmmaking!</strong> Some of us are, shall we say, no longer in our 20s. And that’s ok. We still have lives. We’re still interesting. And we still deserve to have stories told about us.</p>
<h3>Where does the money go?</h3>
<p>It takes a village to raise a child and a city to make a film. A lot of time, money, effort, and equipment go into every moment you see on screen. We filmed under a SAG-AFTRA contract with professional actors and hired professional technical crew. Our film has already been shot, is currently being completed, and then will be submitted to film festivals so it can be seen. Each phase needs funding:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Production costs</strong> – cast, crew, gear (camera, lighting, sound), makeup and hair, location fee, insurance, and food for our hardworking cast and crew</li>
<li>
<strong>Post Production costs</strong> – editing, music composing, color correction, sound mixing</li>
<li>
<strong>And beyond</strong> – film festival submissions</li>
</ul>
<p>Any funds raised above and beyond our goal will go towards future film projects. We want to make more movies for you to enjoy!</p>
<h3>How are you important?</h3>
<p>We can’t do this without you! Filmmaking is a collaborative effort and you can help. We appreciate your contributions, whether you contribute financially or spread the word and share the project. We raise our coffee cups to you in thanks!  </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! I'm Julia Perez-Chavez a Mexican-American Filmmaker and Current student at Columbia College Hollywood! I am currently an Intern at Align Pictures and I am a proud member of the Evolve Entertainment Fund Program, awarded by Mayor Eric Garcetti.</p>
<p>I was born and raised in East LA but my family and I moved to Colorado a few years back and now I've returned to study Film and Television Production and Directing with an unofficial minor in Cinematography.</p>
<p>As a senior here at CCH I will be filming my thesis film ""When Sparks Fly""</p>
<p>My film is about two teens with rough uprisings and how their friendship slowly falls apart because of distrust and betrayal, these events lead to a cruel unforgettable Prom night.</p>

<p>The film was inspired by an event that happened in East Los Angeles when I was younger. The year before my older sister was heading into Garfield High School, some students burned down the auditorium and some classrooms. My dad being the stern overprotective father, decided that he didn't want any of his kids going into a school with such danger, gang violence, and drugs involved. So he decided to move us to Colorado, in a small town that seemed like a retirement town to be more specific. I always wondered what could have started the fire, and so I decided to write my film about it. I wrote this film to show that men just like women have strong and valid emotions. We're all human and we deal with our troubles and emotions in all kinds of ways. But sometimes the pressure of being a ""man"" can drive one to the extreme.</p>

<b>Food: </b>It would be amazing if we can provide warm meals for all the cast and crew of 15 people plus all the Extras! Especially on the Prom day! (Did you know Lunchtime is the most dangerous time of the day! Yup, it can make or break the attitude and performance of everyone on set!</li>
<li>
<b>Transportation</b>: I would love to be able to pay for everyone's transportation, Gas isn't cheap...especially in California. So I plan on compensating everyone who takes the effort to join and help me create my film!</li>
<li>
<strong>Set Design and Props: </strong>Our goal is to make the film and the locations look and feel as authentic as possible. And for the Prom! We need to make is as Fabulous as possible! Streamer, Light, Banners, Balloons, Disco balls!</li>

<li>
<strong>Locations: </strong>With your help, we'd be able to secure awesome locations! A house, a School, and a venue for the Prom! We'd need to get permits and the proper permission to film anywhere in LA.</li>
<li>
<strong>Camera Equipment: </strong>In order to film and capture the cool shots we plan on getting, we'd need some cool equipment like easy rigs, stabilizers, Dolly's, and you can't forget the lenses! </li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As a Mexican-American Female filmmaker, I want to be able to create and Direct this large production with my team! I was always afraid of raising my voice or speaking up to people or speaking my mind. But when I'm Directing and filming I feel creative, free, and inspired.</p>
<p>I want to create this film about Hispanic struggles, broken bonds, and Betrayal. Troubled Neighborhood and how growing up means growing apart.</p>
<p>We all have been there when we had a bond we thought could not be broken, but at the most unexpected moment, it just ends. I thought it would be interesting to see it from a male point of view and demonstrate how emotional men can be. We all have valid emotions </p>
<p>It gives me a sense of pride to be creating a film in my home town of East Los Angeles! The culture, music, food, people, and art in the city are inspiring and the stories are worth the listen!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The famous saying follows everyone everywhere, especially if you plan something extensively. ""Anything that can go wrong will go wrong"" and we have to be ready to handle any issue that comes our way.  But with your Help and support, we can be ready to face any financial challenge to come! </p>

My original idea, 12 years ago, was to compile an anthology of strange, funny and heartbreaking stories into one big documentary film about Utah.Filming at a Utah mall in 2004 






Shooting broll at a murder scene in 2003



Conducting an interview of a Salt Lake City strip club owner



Everything was coming together great, but then Michael Moore came to town.


In 2004, I shot, edited, produced and directed by first feature film ""This Divided State"" about filmmaker Michael Moore's controversial visit to Orem, UT 2 weeks before the Bush/Kerry presidential election. Originally, this event was going to be a just another entry in my anthology, but it quickly grew into something of its own.

I spent 4 months slowly ripping all the footage. I poured through every interview, every shot, and every story. I laughed, cried and reminisced. Some of this stuff was just too good to remain forever locked away in storage. I wanted people to see it.

THE RELEASE PLAN:
Since I never actually completed production, some of these stories exist as small fragments of a bigger picture.
An official website will host all the videos.
I have at least 15 stories including:- The Crazy Goat Saloon, the death of the Salt Lake City strip club

A light hearted comedic romp quickly spirals into a dark tragedy, as secrets are revealed (or
exposed), and lives are changed dramatically.In a world that has become complicit in the culture of secrecy, we hope to, through a mixture of comedy and drama, examine the destructive nature of these secrets to the lives of those around us.

We also follow a full cast of characters who really come to terms with their identities, and the outside factors that both assist and detract from our true understanding. We look at how the way we grow up shapes our views of ourselves, by diving into the small mindedness of some Midwestern residents on the subject of sex and sexuality, as well as the way that some religious groups view/condemn it.  We also jump head first into the subject of depression, addiction, and loss.LIZZY: Megan Weyant

This campaign is designed to initially raise the funds for production alone.  This will allows us to cover the basic costs of production.





So once, with your support, we hit our initial goal, we will set a stretch goal of $5,000.




This will allow us to pay our main talent a little better, as well as take care of our dedicated crew, and beef up the amount we can pump into production design.





Once we can pay our main cast & crew, we will push ahead toward a goal of $10,000. 




This will help us to cover post-production costs, and initial distribution, as well as, once again, increase the amount we can put into giving this film a unique look.





When this goal has been met, we will strive for a goal of $20,000. 





This will ensure that we can compensate all of our major players, and bring more value to the overall look and feel of the film.  This will also help us to take better care of the film on the back end.






We know that times are tough, and there are a million things you can invest in.
This film could be shot on no budget, with bland sets, and average production quality, but that isn't fair to you the viewer, the cast and crew that are dedicating their time, or to the story itself.
We want to be able to fill the
screen with production value, to create a more rich and believable world.
Everyone will be able to see a running, live breakdown of where the funds go for this film on our website, and on this page, if they wish.
In the interest of full transparency, we want you to know that every penny donated to this campaign will go to what you see on the screen when we have a completed project.





Once again, we know that not everyone can afford to give, what with the economy and all that, but there are other (just as important) ways to help as well!

If you have a Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, email, website, bulletin board, megaphone, mouth, or even a Myspace (…maybe?), then you can help us out by spreading the word.

The more people we can reach, the better we can do with this project.  The more people that see this page, the better publicity and exposure we can receive, and the better the film can be.

In keeping with our philosophy, we encourage, and welcome to participate in our projects, anyone with a passion for acting, lighting, makeup, writing, stunts, singing, or any other creative expression as it relates to film & media. 

If you have passion, and want to have a good time doing what you love, we want you. 

We want to ignite the passion that you have, and use it however we can to benefit everyone involved.

In the end, we want everyone to leave having gained something. Whether it is valuable experiences, fond memories, a feeling that you can't shake, or, most importantly right now, an adventure on film that will reignite a passion in your lives.

That is what this is really about. Lighting the fire that drives you and keeping it lit. Igniting lives together through art.

Thank you for reading, and thank you for your continued support.

His daughter, Carol, decides that it's best to send them both to a home care facility even though he tries to convince her that he can take care of her on his own.</p>
<p>On the night before they are to move out, he finds a old nipa hut-shaped music box that plays a Filipino nursery rhyme, Bahay Kubo. And when Dorothy, hears it, it somehow triggers bits and pieces of her memory.</p>
<p>With this musical discovery, Arthur hopes to reconnect with his wife. But will this suffice?</p>

<h3>What does Mahal Mean?</h3>
<div>Mahal is a Filipino word that has two meanings. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Mahal as a noun is a term of affection  akin to ""sweetheart"", ""honey"" or ""love"". </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Mahal as an adjective means expensive.</span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><h3>Why am I telling this story?</h3>
<p>The basic premise of the script was a brainchild of myself and Andrew Zimmerman in our Ideation and Theme class back at Columbia College Chicago. Andrew had a personal experience with Alzheimer's in his family and was very much interested in the initial theme of atonement. </p>
<p>While I may not have a close encounter with Alzheimer's and Dementia in my family, I was able to relate the  theme with the unexpected passing of my Mom in 2005 in the Philippines. When she passed away, I was in Singapore studying and I didn't get the chance to see her in her deathbed.</p>
<p>Writing the script for Mahal was therapeutic as it  became my love letter to my Mom. This is why this film is more than just my thesis film. It is my way of honoring my Mom, Estrella.</p></span></div>

<p>I personally
faced many challenges while writing this piece and having the project brought
to life. Writing “Sunshine Day” opened up a lot of old wounds and unwanted
memories of a tragedy that happen to my entire family when I was just five
years old. I started writing Sunshine Day because I felt that it may be
therapeutic for me but after completing the script I found it to be far more
than that. I developed the courage to finally talk about what happened that
night to family and friends. I found that my story brought hope to some and
encouraged others which led me to seek out a production crew so that my screen
play can be turned into a movie. I know that by making this film a lot of lives
will be saved and that's what keeps me inspired.</p>

When the three of us got together and decided to make a horror film, that’s when the idea of shooting it in Lake Isabella was born. From there we had a concept meeting to create the story to best serve the purpose of this location. Once we developed the idea around 3 sisters traveling through the Mojave Desert to their brother’s wedding, everything started to fall into place. </p>
<p>We ultimately decided to change the name to <i>F***, Marry, Kill</i>. For those not familiar this game is wildly popular, especially with Howard Stern listeners. The general idea is that you are given 3 names of celebrities or people you all know and then you have to choose which one you would F***, which one you would marry, and which one you would kill. It made an interesting title for our film based on the fact that the characters are playing this game on their road trip and it also has a nice play on words for the events that start to happen to them once they reach the town.</p></span><h3><br/></h3>

<p><br/></p> </div> <p><br/></p></div>","We are three actresses Janine Gateland, Catherine Eure and Rachel Ryling who are producing the short thriller F***, Marry, Kill.  Created and written by us, we can't wait to tell you all about it and take you on our journey in getting this awesome film made!What is the film about?

F***, Marry, Kill is a short thriller, directed by Scott Donovan.  The story follows three sisters traveling through the Mojave Desert on their way to their brothers wedding.




A sinister turn of events leads them to a twisted, maddening town where a psychotic, cult-like community kidnaps women and forces them to marry, procreate or be sacrificed.  These residents seem hell bent on making it their final destination.

Why back our film?
We have a wonderful script, concept, amazing locations, fabulous cast & crew, and now awesome footage.  Some of the cast include Timothy Carhart known for ""Thelma and Louise"", ""Ghostbusters"", ""The Hunt for Red October""  and ""Witness"".  We are also pleased to say we have the lovely Lorna Scott known for ""Wanted"", ""Little Britain USA"", ""The Guilt Trip"", ""Little Boy"", ""Sorded Lives"" and HBO TV series ""True Blood"".
We are half way there to getting this funded and need a little of your help.

Meet some of the characters


     Jessica                Carrie              Tiffany

Jessica, Carrie and Tiffany are 3 siblings, all from LA but now live in different states across the US. They are all very different in personality; so going on this road trip to their brother’s wedding may be a recipe for disaster, until town folk of Lake Isabella step in to the mix.
Janine
Gateland as Tiffany Forbes
32 year old Tiffany Forbes is a Casino manager at the Tropicana Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. Since her
failed marriage from her cheating husband, Tiffany has been on a downward
spiral finding a new fling every week!
Tiffany hasn’t seen her sisters
in over a year since the disastrous wedding, and now shamefully faces the music of her past mess up before plunged into a messy desert disaster. 
Rachel Ryling as Jessica Forbes

Jessica Forbes is 30 years old
and born and raised in Los Angeles.  An
aspiring actress by day and bartender by night. Jessica the fiery risk taker, takes her sisters on a
ride through the Mojave desert they will never forget!
Catherine Eure as Carrie Forbes
Carrie Forbes is a 24 year old Art
Student at the North Carolina School of the Arts.  She is the baby of the family, and often,
even though she’s the youngest, is the peace-maker, the voice of reason.  Their journey though the desert sets Carrie keeping
them all together in more ways than one.

Claude Duhamel as Stone Walker

Stone is Tiffany’s
latest squeeze; he met her at one of his gigs. 
Pretends to lead a successful rock star lifestyle but is really a drug
dealer and drug addict!  A bit of an idiot
and not much going on between the ears. 
A ladies man and can be a bit of a charmer but usually once they get to
know him, they realize he’s a dopy annoying ‘stoner’.  He likes Tiffany because she has loads of
money and game for a laugh. Comes along for the ride of his life! 
Timothy Carhart as the Sheriff 
By appearance he's the trustworthy sheriff in town with an evil, sinister side to him. 
Lorna Scott as Marge
Larger than life in personality, Marge is part of the crazy town folk of Lake Isabella. With a creepy undertone - you wouldn't want to be trapped in her trailer late at night! 
Paul Duke as Jones

   

Lives
in a trailer park.  He’s a major ass, a

Why shoot F***, Marry, Kill?

The concept for this film started with Rachel’s connection with Lake
Isabella. Her husband is from this rural town 3 hours north of Los Angeles.
She originally was introduced to it when she met his family for the first time.



On that very first visit she knew the setting would make a captivating location for a film and kept it in the back of her mind for a possible future project. When the three of us got together and decided to make a horror film, that’s when the idea of shooting it in Lake Isabella was born. From there we had a concept meeting to create the story to best serve the purpose of this location. Once we developed the idea around 3 sisters traveling through the Mojave Desert to their brother’s wedding, everything started to fall into place. 
We ultimately decided to change the name to F***, Marry, Kill. For those not familiar this game is wildly popular, especially with Howard Stern listeners. The general idea is that you are given 3 names of celebrities or people you all know and then you have to choose which one you would F***, which one you would marry, and which one you would kill. It made an interesting title for our film based on the fact that the characters are playing this game on their road trip and it also has a nice play on words for the events that start to happen to them once they reach the town.


What is this town 'Lake Isabella'?

Situated in the Mojave Desert, Lake Isabella used to be a thriving tourist town with a beautiful lake.  In the last 10 years tourism has been driven away due to the lake drying up.  

We thought the concept of this film being based around this lake would be perfect.

               



   
Upon visiting this very deserted community, we came across some amazing visual locations and interesting town folk.




How We'll Use The Money









We are half way there with our budget from getting this movie made.  With your help, WE CAN DO IT!  We really need our last bit of funding for Post-Production in getting this movie edited.  We need the footage edited and music added.  We also have some pick up shots to shoot so we will need to hire our super awesome crew for camera, lighting and sound equipment that will tie pieces together.  Marketing this film will get us out there and seen to the world along with festival circuit submissions and lastly Indiegogo fees. 


Risks & Challenges

 This project was very challenging to film as we were filming on location up in the Mojave Desert.  The heat combined with wind and dust made it than much more challenging, also half of the movie is in the dark so lighting was extremely important. But what we came away with from our shoot was amazing professional footage.  We are very proud of the material we have, we now just need to get the finished product edited and out there.
Been on a tough budget is extremely hard and we really want to make this movie stand out and be a movie to remember!  But regardless of our risks and challenges, we are very positive and confident that we can do this and we won't stop until we get there!

<p>The arts have catalysed huge changes in people’s lives.  Have you
heard of Daniel Barenboim, the conductor who brought Israeli’s and
Palestinian’s together through a mutual love for Beethoven? Did you know
that Lucy Walker's documentary Waste Land (2011), about the artist Vik
Muniz's work with garbage collectors in Brazil not only spurred a conversation
across the world about how waste could make art, but catalyzed profound changes
in the lives of these people, enabling them to get better jobs and, in one case,
sell their art for over $64,000?  Or have
you heard about Hua Dan, an innovative non-profit in China, using theatre as a
tool to empower migrant workers from the countryside to both benefit from and
contribute to the huge changes in Chinese society?</p>
<p>The arts are also helping to propel the economy
forward.  These days, the creative
industries are one of the fastest-growing sectors of almost all world
economies. From 2002 to 2011, the global creative economy more than doubled,
reaching a record US$624 billion.  At the
same time, developing economies averaged 12.1 per cent annual growth in the
export of creative goods.  In the USA alone, the copyright industries
account for 11% of GDP, which is significantly larger than the finance and
insurance, construction, health and Federal Government sectors.</p>
<p>The <b>Global Arts Impact Agenda</b> is
building a movement to enable government and business to unleash human
potential through the arts.  Our <b>vision</b> is of a world
where the arts and culture are habitually and by default utilised in
government-led and corporate initiatives to build healthy, happy and prosperous
communities, regardless of whether those initiatives are political, economic or
social.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We
have produced a series of reports that show evidence of governments and
businesses successfully using the arts to make communities and organisations
healthier, happier and more prosperous. We have found success stories across
all sectors and subjects, from healthcare and education to sustainability and
urbanisation and beyond.</span><br/></p>
<p>With
the first of these reports in the hands of governments and businesses, we can
help public and private organisations understand exactly how the arts can help.
The reports will also provide best practices to adapt and use in their own
contexts.</p>
<p><b>The
Big Picture</b></p>
<p>We
will then launch a global movement to make the arts at the front and centre of
public policy initiatives. The heart of this will be a ‘Charter for the Arts’
that we will develop based on the results of these initial reports.</p>
<p>The
reports and the Charter will then form the bedrock of an annual 'Best Practices
in the Arts' global index. The index will rate each country according to the
strengths in provision for the arts, then identify gaps to be filled.</p>
<p>Our
International Strategic Programmes team will then deliver 2 - 3 year projects
to help countries meet the criteria established in our 'Charter for the Arts'.
We are targetting 10 governments to be signed up to the Charter by 2025.</p><p></p><p>We are looking for an initial £5000 to support the editing of the reports, the infrastructure needed to establish GAIA as a legal entity, and build our initial partnerships.</p><div>

The film's message needs to be heard: that there are many Glens out there whose behavior may be misunderstood and who aren't getting the supports they need. ""You need to carve 30 minutes out of your day and watch the mini-documentary 'Glen’s Village.'"" -Mike Lyons, Writer and Co-Owner | West Philly LocalOur goal is to create ""Glen's Village"" packages containing the film, a discussion guide and poster that we can mail out to principals, high school guidance counselors and other child advocates who want to screen the film. ""This film needs to be shown in every inner city school across the country."" -Rich Neal, Behavioral Specialist | NorthEast Treatment CentersWe also hope to enter the film in multiple film festivals to raise its profile as a way to spark discussions about childhood trauma. The film was just accepted into Atlanta's Peachtree Village International Film Festival and Santa Fe's AMFM Fest – we want to build on that success! We are seeking $6,000 to fund our film promotion project. Our proposed budget includes:$3,000 - to produce and distribute ""Glen's Village"" kits to schools and nonprofits$2,000 - to enter and participate in film festivals$1,000 - to produce materials to promote ""Glen's Village"" as a resource for understanding childhood traumaThe Philadelphia Public School Notebook (thenotebook.org) is an independent, reader-supported nonprofit news organization that covers the Philadelphia public schools. The Notebook serves as an information source and voice for parents, students, teachers, and other members of the community who are working for quality and equality in Philadelphia's public schools. ""'Glen's Village' is a powerful story
 that illuminates how much agency students like Glen have, waiting to be
 supported... and how much work we have to do as a society to give them the
 opportunities they deserve."" - AJ Schiera, Public School Teacher and Researcher | Consortium for Policy Research and Education, University of Pennsylvania",1.0,0,"1 Campaign
