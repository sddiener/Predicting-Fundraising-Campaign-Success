Many students don't take time to connect with others and develop the relationships with their peers. CharlesTea is focused on the connection of the health benefits of Tea and connecting Youth population with others. When we share and ""break bread"" or share Tea, we forge a common understanding that is therapeutic for our mental health. Social Media or the aimless scrolling of Facebook cannot replicate the function of the laugh of two friends sipping on a  hearty cup of English Breakfast.
The contribution you make helps to fund the sourcing of different Teas that have known health qualities. It will also help with the funding of an Online Store that will target a more youthful audience. It will include packaging, label development and webpage development. 
History demonstrates humanity's love-affair with Tea and how it is symbol of cultures globally.  What We Need & What You Get
I want to source initially around about 10 different teas, these tea will include Black Teas to Green Tea.



I need $1000 for my initial shipment of Tea from a local supplier: this includes packaging and logo branding.

Web development will cost $500 
$300 for Teapots and Tea accessories.

The final $200 will go toward the Headspace National Youth Mental Health Foundation.
I cannot explain how excited I am to share the love of Tea with others. We are all connoisseurs of Tea. Our opinions on the taste and flavour matter. 
If cannot reach the target at the end of the period, I will donate 10% of all money raised to Headspace

The Impact


In the broader scheme of things we all battle with the issues of mental health and therefore this cause is part of who we all are. The CharlesTea Project is forging a belief in the product of Tea with the desire for the masses to share it with another. Analyse it, Taste it and love it. The Project consolidates the belief in a more healthier mental capacity when we engage in raw and genuine human interaction. I know this works, I have seen it. It has helped me through times of struggle. The things I have learned over a cup of Tea with a complete stranger amazes me.   Risks & Challenges
The risks and Challenges that I do face are that I am a university student who lacks a regular income. I only really can own the bigger dollars on summer holidays. Therefore I have trying to divide and prioritize the money between: Rent for 2016 and funding my business ideas. 
This funding would overcome these hurdles, as I wouldn't have to fall short with ideas. I could fully fund them and gain the proper results I need to make CharlesTea successful. Other Ways You Can Help
The smallest fund helps with not only raising the issue of Youth Mental Health but also developing a strategy to tackle it head on. It creates an interest, a shared connection and in some cases a friendship that could be lifeline.

Why AFC?
 In addition to our other programs, AFC has been dedicated to making hospital time less frightening and more healing since our ArtHeals program began several years ago.  
This program was the idea of the kids at the AFC Children’s Home, who have volunteered their own time and effort to make it a reality.  By using art to transform the children’s wings in hospitals and clinics with bright colors and friendly images, we endeavor to make these environments less frightening and more engaging for the children who have to spend their time there. 
The program has been so successful, we have been asked by a growing number of hospitals to uplift more pediatric areas, and to return to expand our project in the places we've already served.  
Health professionals surveyed at these sites state that AFC's efforts have improved their relationships with their patients, created a more friendly environment for children, families, and staff, and even helped the children heal by improving their emotional state.

I have been cooking for more than 2 decades, working alongside some of the best cooks in the country. In my years of grinding in southern kitchens I have learned so much about food, but also about time management and how to squeeze every little penny of worth from every morsel of food. Making great food is a huge part of the food business, but the mesh of hospitality and business comes from experience, and learning from my own mistakes as well as those around me is a great advantage. I've been a part of opening a handful of restaurants- high end to casual, all the while learning the art of controlling expenditures.  I have an innate love for southern flavors and culinary traditions but also have a grasp on progessive techniques and trends, and have always enjoyed getting gritty in the kitchen and pulling more than my own weight, but have always had to eventually answer to someone else. The opportunity to own a food truck will make my dreams of being my own boss/landlord a reality.

The agriculture in this state is amazing, better than most; The farmers and artisans are uber passionate about their work, and rightfully so.  With this food truck I want to create an opportunity for farmers to showcase what it is that they do from sun-up to sundown. I think helping to create a draw to these farms and emphasizing their importance is imperative to the present and more so for the future. This truck will hopefully become a catalyst for people to go out and meet local growers, or cattlemen, or cheese makers, or fishermen, or brewers and vintners. Hopefully we will spend most of our time on this truck doing pop-ups on farms and other events around the state. We will also be using North Carolina product everyday whenever possible, making people excited about the food grown around them. Having worked in many different styles of restaurants, I am capable of doing high-end dinners and catered banquets, as well as a faster, more casual (and more affordable) lunch, dinner, or late night snack in the street.

<p></p>
<p></p><p>The
Peace Bees name comes from the misunderstanding that honey bees are mean and
want to sting; rather, honey bees are quite peaceful creatures. Honey bees only
become aggressive to defend their hive and can sense fear and negative energy.
This forces the beekeeper to control their mood and to increase their level of
respect for the bees resulting in a therapeutic environment for the keeper.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> Similar to the honey bee, some people are misunderstood and have difficulty
finding gainful employment. Some veterans, the disabled, or parolees all face challenges finding employment. We intend to give these people
a second chance by teaching them job and life skills, and provide them
employment during a 1-year training program. At the end of their year, the
individuals will be ready to transition into the mainstream </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">workforce

why are we looking to you for help? Until now, we have been a family business

Risks & Challenges  
Any
business has risks and challenges and beekeeping is no different. It is farming
and ranching mixed into one which offer challenges different to most businesses. We are working with livestock and our success is very dependent
on the weather. Healthy, well adapted queens are also important and we are working on ways to propagate  our own survivor stock to maintain a sustainable environment. We will need to find a source of quality bees and are looking to California as a source but having our own queens will insure our success. An
appropriate facility to work from is extremely important. We need an area to build equipment and store it during off season. We also need a clean, area to meet health requirements for both honey processing and our personal care products. Finding both of these may be challenging but we will make it work. All of these are known challenges and items we can work around as needed. The biggest challenge is having adequate funding to cover
our project costs for the first year. Current market estimates:

Once the project is up and running there will be a financial return to sustain
the expansion of the business. We are already lining up income opportunities to keep the project
going and eager to provide products and services to our waiting customers.
The
Peace Bees team has the years of business, education, community and
beekeeping experience to make this project succeed. To insure our success, we
have our partners at Goodwill who will provide the wraparound support for us
and our employees. This project has been a dream of our for many years and now is the time to make it happen. Nothing will keep us from helping the bees and those challenged to find employment.
Other Ways You Can Help
We
know that not everyone can contribute financially, but you can still help by
sharing our project with everyone you know. Indiegogo provides tools to help
share to make it even easier. You can also contact us for other opportunities to support our project. Either way, we thank you for taking the time to

<p>As a youth growing up in the suburbs outside of Richmond city, I was never exposed to the issue of homelessness -- I never realized it even existed in my community. It wasn't until I started attending school in the city that I saw the panhandlers and the poverty that surely exists in Richmond. And even as I began to learn more about the issue, I realized that my peers and classmates were still unaware of those citizens that sleep on the streets right outside our schools. This pushed me to make a change.

</div></div>","Summary


In the face of police brutality, anti-black racism as a global phenomenon, and the fight for positive representation , we have been able to create days where black people can generate visibility and celebrate all that makes us unique.
This all started as a simple Tumblr post. T'von (expect-the-greatest) suggested we have a day where the black users of Tumblr post and reblog only selfies. When Marissa (marissarei.tumblr.com) suggested that the day be called ""The Blackout"", the movement was officially born. The original post started gaining momentum and the final member of the team,  nukirk. digi.tal (nukirk.tumblr.com),  created promo art for the different social media platforms bearing the hashtag #Blackoutday, and to our pleasant surprise, the movement went viral! Since March 6th, 2015 we've been hard at work and listening to feedback and noticing the needs of black online communities.  

We continue inviting black people of all walks of life to showcase and celebrate all the wonderful ways that their black is beautiful. We also want to go a step further and create networking opportunities for black people across social media platforms. That's where you come in. Once properly funded, our long term goals include promoting black businesses and art, launching a non-profit to give back to black communities,  and organizing meetups where people can make real life connections. We have been an opportunity to do real work and we want to take it. 
What We Need & What You Get
 In order to get our feet on the ground, we need to trademark all affiliated tags and logos, register as a legitimate business entity (in order to get things like tax ID numbers, business numbers, etc), and do a lot of legal paperwork (with application fees!) so that we can grow.  
All funds raised here will go toward:



Labor (We will be commissioning black web developers, graphic designers, artists, etc..)


Legal fees (trademarking and registration fees, building a legal team)


Cost of Web Operations (website and domain fees)

Advertising (We have to buy ad space to get the movement supported!)
Merchandise (Preliminary merch includes #BlackoutDay wristbands, stickers, and t-shirts!)

Of course, you as our supporters will get to enjoy 
 Promotion of your blogs, art, or businesses in return for your donations! Exclusive, first print, and totally awesome #BlackoutDay merch.
Being an integral part of the first steps to solidify a movement that has already swept the internet time and time again

Any extra money will not only help us start, but keep us going!
If you want a perk, make sure to select it!   The Impact We've already been able to do so much in the year since the first #BlackoutDay and with selfies alone. We have seen black folks all over the world connect and bond using our hashtag.

My name is JD Liebrock and my other half is Keri Finnell. We, along with a team of friends, are on a new venture to crack into the multi-billion dollar whiskey industry.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Flavored spirits is the fastest growing alcohol market in the world. It is growing faster than microbrewery. In the 1800's the state of Virginia had over 3600 micro distilleries; 200 years later and one prohibition period, we have only four active micro distilleries in the state of Georgia. Thousands of people love moonshine, made popular due to the reality TV show the ""Moonshiners."" However, most individuals do not want to chance being arrested for buying illegal moonshine. That is where we come in - legal corn whiskey! Made in the same copper stills and with the same great water from Sugar Hill, Georgia. So come join our team of investors and become part owner of a company that is in the forefront of the ""Legal Spirits"" market.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>What is driving us to take on this venture?</b></p>
<p>I have made some great beer, wine and unaged spirits while living in foreign countries. I returned to the United States and found that I love being a beekeeper. It was just a natural jump to wanting to make some good mead and spirit from the honey but I found out quickly that a person cannot make spirits for home use. This was unfortunate since I had made some great spirits over many years. </p>
<p>I decided to look into how to make whiskey/spirits legally and finally made it through all the government paperwork. It was all the government paperwork and regulations that made me realize why people never make legal shine. I then started working on a business plan that would allow people to come to a distillery and make their own spirits, flavor the spirits, and then place their own name on the label.  </p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> </div><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><div>Fortunately, we already purchased the land with a great source of water and all the paperwork completed. Our next step is purchasing large enough stills to support all the interest from the local community. The funds will be used to purchase three 100 gallon stills and four mash making containers which will allow us to increase production of small batches of fantastic Spirits.</div><p>Go to our webpage at <a href=""http://www.sugarhillstills.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.sugarhillstills.com</a> and see our incentives for all of our donors and all levels. Follow the link on top of the webpage to the Crowd Funding Plan. We have everything from shot glass to Warrants (future stock options) for the company. YES, you can be an owner of a distillery!</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>What we have invested and the difference crowd funding will make</strong></p><ul>
<li>Please go to our webpage at <a href=""http://www.sugarhillstills.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.sugarhillstills.com</a> and click on the Newsletter at the top of the page, it will give you the breakdown on how the funding will be used. we have already invested $133,000.00 in property, bonding, trade name, equipment, and have the application completed for our federal distillery license.</li>
<li>Funding will determine the level of production. Our newsletter defines what we expect to profit based on start-up funds. Market analysis indicate that micro distilleries clear over 2 - 5 million dollars in profit the first year. Most start with one or two stills and do about two runs (distilled spirits) a day. </li>
</ul><div>   </div><div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Our biggest risk is keeping up with all the regulations, labeling, license, and approvals. We have taken the steps to mitigate this by hiring a company called ""Whiskey Systems"" to keep us on track.</p>
<p>We will be publishing our financial books to all investors so that everyone will be able to track our progress.</p>
<p>We will also send out our business plan per email request to our investors. We will always look for feedback on improving the company.  </p> </div> <div> </div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><div> </div><p>We understand that some people just cannot afford to contribute but that doesn't mean you can't help.

Our next step is purchasing large enough stills to support all the interest from the local community. The funds will be used to purchase three 100 gallon stills and four mash making containers which will allow us to increase production of small batches of fantastic Spirits.Go to our webpage at www.sugarhillstills.com and see our incentives for all of our donors and all levels. Follow the link on top of the webpage to the Crowd Funding Plan. We have everything from shot glass to Warrants (future stock options) for the company. YES, you can be an owner of a distillery!What we have invested and the difference crowd funding will make
Please go to our webpage at www.sugarhillstills.com and click on the Newsletter at the top of the page, it will give you the breakdown on how the funding will be used. we have already invested $133,000.00 in property, bonding, trade name, equipment, and have the application completed for our federal distillery license.
Funding will determine the level of production. Our newsletter defines what we expect to profit based on start-up funds. Market analysis indicate that micro distilleries clear over 2 - 5 million dollars in profit the first year. Most start with one or two stills and do about two runs (distilled spirits) a day. 
    Risks & Challenges Our biggest risk is keeping up with all the regulations, labeling, license, and approvals. We have taken the steps to mitigate this by hiring a company called ""Whiskey Systems"" to keep us on track.
We will be publishing our financial books to all investors so that everyone will be able to track our progress.
We will also send out our business plan per email request to our investors. We will always look for feedback on improving the company.     Other Ways You Can Help We understand that some people just cannot afford to contribute but that doesn't mean you can't help. Listed below is some of the things that you can do with a little incentive for spreading the word:  Get the word out and make some noise about becoming owners of a micro distillery.

The Impact

 We've been hanging around Armley for a while but we really need a permanent base so we can:  Continue to help people get online with re-used computers.
Keep on repairing your broken laptops as affordably as possible.
Take on more volunteers: we're looking at larger spaces which would allow us to bring in four more volunteers.
Support more small, local organisations with their IT issues.
Potentially start courses so that people can study computer hardware and networking with us.





What happens if we don't get the full £10,000?

We'll still use the money to move, it's just our choices of premises will be more limited, and we'll really have to hit the ground running in our new place!
What happens if we get more than £10,000?
Like most not-for-profit organisations, there are a lot of things we could use extra cash for. Better equipment, more training for staff and volunteers, and publicising ourselves better are the likely priorities.

We recently purchased a 13,000 square foot building in the heart of Allentown's business district (near 5th and Hamilton Streets) and plan to open in early 2016.</p>
<p>Last year, when we announced our vision for a vibrant LGBT community center in downtown Allentown, it was a vision - now it's close to being a reality. We have a building, owned by our organization. The building has great community space for support groups, book clubs, discussion groups and more. We are planning to include an LGBT library with both fiction and non-fiction materials. The Center will provide space for a free LGBT legal clinic, for HIV/STI testing, for LGBT health fairs, and more. Really - the sky is the limit on programming potential, but we need the funds to open our center. </p>
<p>Hundreds of donors have contributed since June 2014 to make this dream a reality. We are so close, this campaign is intended to harness the power of community to take us through the finish line and open our center in early 2016!</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We are very close to opening - but in order to get there - we need an additional $20,000 to make the repairs and install finishings to open the center in early 2016. We estimate that this includes $10,000 of roofing repairs, $3,000 of electric and plumbing work, $2,000 for paint, and $5,000 for other finishings. </p>
<p>We are hoping to raise these funds the grassroots way. Your donation of $5, $10, $25 or $50 goes along way! We, of course, appreciate larger contributions as well! </p>
<p>Frankly, we are committed to opening the center - that's why we bought the building and are moving forward quickly. But the more we raise, the more we can do to make the Center sparkly and ready to open! EVERY DOLLAR gets us closer, EVERY DONOR makes a difference. </p>
<p>Here's what you get:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>A vibrant LGBT community center serving the Lehigh Valley</li>
<li>A place for LGBT-affirming support groups to meet</li>
<li>A home for the Lehigh Valley LGBT community</li>
<li>The knowledge that your contribution helped make this dream a reality!</li>
</ul>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Allentown's LGBT community grew by 55% between 2000 and 2010 (US Census), yet the programs and services available to our community haven't followed that growth. Bradbury-Sullivan LGBT Community Center seeks to revolutionize the programs and services available to our local LGBT community. We've been doing great work without a building - imagine what we can do with one!</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>If we don't meet our fundraising goal, we still plan to open our center - however we'll need to make strategic decisions about the space and we may not be able to open as soon as we would like to.</p>
<p>If you would like a tax receipt for your donation since we are a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, we encourage you to donate directly on our website (<a href=""http://www.bradburysullivancenter.org/donate"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.bradburysullivancenter.org/donate</a>). We are unable to provide you with a receipt if you donate through Indiegogo. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>In addition to donating, we are also in need of volunteers to help with light tasks in the building (such as painting and cleaning). Please email liz@bradburysullivancenter.org if you (or a team from your organization) would like to volunteer!</li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">If you have a relevant professional service related to opening a building and would like to provide pro-bono support, please email adrian@bradburysullivancenter.org</span></li>

</div></div>","Summary Bradbury-Sullivan LGBT Community Center is preparing to open an LGBT community center in downtown Allentown, PA! We recently purchased a 13,000 square foot building in the heart of Allentown's business district (near 5th and Hamilton Streets) and plan to open in early 2016.
Last year, when we announced our vision for a vibrant LGBT community center in downtown Allentown, it was a vision - now it's close to being a reality. We have a building, owned by our organization. The building has great community space for support groups, book clubs, discussion groups and more. We are planning to include an LGBT library with both fiction and non-fiction materials. The Center will provide space for a free LGBT legal clinic, for HIV/STI testing, for LGBT health fairs, and more. Really - the sky is the limit on programming potential, but we need the funds to open our center. 
Hundreds of donors have contributed since June 2014 to make this dream a reality. We are so close, this campaign is intended to harness the power of community to take us through the finish line and open our center in early 2016!   What We Need & What You Get We are very close to opening - but in order to get there - we need an additional $20,000 to make the repairs and install finishings to open the center in early 2016. We estimate that this includes $10,000 of roofing repairs, $3,000 of electric and plumbing work, $2,000 for paint, and $5,000 for other finishings. 
We are hoping to raise these funds the grassroots way. Your donation of $5, $10, $25 or $50 goes along way! We, of course, appreciate larger contributions as well! 
Frankly, we are committed to opening the center - that's why we bought the building and are moving forward quickly. But the more we raise, the more we can do to make the Center sparkly and ready to open! EVERY DOLLAR gets us closer, EVERY DONOR makes a difference. 
Here's what you get:


A vibrant LGBT community center serving the Lehigh Valley
A place for LGBT-affirming support groups to meet
A home for the Lehigh Valley LGBT community
The knowledge that your contribution helped make this dream a reality!

    The Impact Allentown's LGBT community grew by 55% between 2000 and 2010 (US Census), yet the programs and services available to our community haven't followed that growth. Bradbury-Sullivan LGBT Community Center seeks to revolutionize the programs and services available to our local LGBT community. We've been doing great work without a building - imagine what we can do with one!
    Risks & Challenges If we don't meet our fundraising goal, we still plan to open our center - however we'll need to make strategic decisions about the space and we may not be able to open as soon as we would like to.
If you would like a tax receipt for your donation since we are a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, we encourage you to donate directly on our website (www.bradburysullivancenter.org/donate). We are unable to provide you with a receipt if you donate through Indiegogo. 
    Other Ways You Can Help

In addition to donating, we are also in need of volunteers to help with light tasks in the building (such as painting and cleaning). Please email liz@bradburysullivancenter.org if you (or a team from your organization) would like to volunteer!
If you have a relevant professional service related to opening a building and would like to provide pro-bono support, please email adrian@bradburysullivancenter.org
For donations of $10,000 or more, we have limited naming opportunities for spaces in the center. Please email adrian@bradburysullivancenter.org to learn more about these naming opportunities.
We are able to accept donations of appreciated securities. Email adrian@bradburysullivancenter.org if you would like to discuss stock donations.

DownEast LLC is a startup that focuses on food and hospitality. DownEast was started in order to share great food with great people and put smiles on everyone's faces! My name is Gina Graveline and I'm 28 years old, originally from Bangor Maine, but I've been living in NYC for over ten years. I've been working in the service industry for seven years now and hospitality and food are my passions in life. I love cooking and love even more to share my food with others. I graduated with a bachelors in business administration, concentration in small business and entreprenuership, in order to pursue my dream of owning my own food truck.  I have launched this campaign in order to raise more funds needed to get my food truck started. I consider myself a foodie and one of the main reasons why I love this city so much is because all of the wonderful diversity in the food options available. I have taken some of my favorite food items that you can find all throughout New York and used them to create my menu. My menu is small but packs a serious punch when it comes to flavor and originality. I want to bring a Maine flare using fresh lobster to the street fare food of New York, such as lobster sliders and lobster tacos. I am very confident in my endeavor and can guarantee that people will enjoy everything that my truck has to offer. I have been working very hard over the past few years and now it's time to share my food with all of you! </div></h3><h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3><h3><div style=""font-weight: normal;"">
<div>I am looking to raise $5,000 which is just enough to help out with my start up inventory. I will be initially renting a truck until I make enough revenue to purchase a truck. DownEast will also be applying to food festivals throughout New York City where all perks will be able to be redeemed. </div>
<div>In order to show my appreciation for the help I recieve there will be a customer loyalty program in which, depending on how much money is donated, will provide many perks such as free food from the truck or even the opportunity to have an item on the menu named after you!</div>
</div></h3><h3>Your Impact</h3><h3><div style=""font-weight: normal;"">Not only will this food truck fulfill my dreams but I hope that in the future I will be able to expand, resulting in new jobs for my fellow New Yorkers. The food truck industry is no walk in the park and takes a lot of hard work and dedication, however I would love to share this experience with other people who have the same passions as myself. I also know for a fact that food is an amazing way to allow people to connect. My goal is to bring people together through my food concept while also allowing everyone to get a genuine expeirience of the food that I grew up loving so much. If you are a true foodie such as myself then you understand how important food can be for people. Putting a smile on someone's face because they enjoy my food is something that is defintley priceless.</div></h3><h3>Low on Cash....Don't Worry! </h3><h3><div style=""font-weight: normal;"">Even if you can't donate any money, word of mouth can be more powerful than anything and it would be greatly apppreciated if everyone could spread the word about this campaign and about DownEast. Please share this campaign with anyone you know that has an appretiation for food and who would be interested in being a part of my journey. Posting this campaign page link through all the social media outlets that you use would be an enormous aid. The Indiegogo share tools are super easy and make it possible for everyone to share the campaign with the world. Everyone involved in this project should know that they are involved in something that is very special in my heart and my appreciation for your help is beyond what words can express.

Our current live groups which are free and open to the public (SILVER Level). These are Mix and Mingle Parties to build relationships and are affordable to those on a budget or want to try out networking for the first time. I promise we will continue to improve and design better meetings as we grow. </b><br/><br/>All courses and training on Facebook, LinkedIn &amp; Sales/Marketing for small business will be optional on a pay per user basis. Organizers can learn at this level how to promote, design &amp; schedule their Meetups for maximum success. Members can stay at the Silver level as long as they like with no salesy pressure tactics to upgrade when they are not ready for it. </p>

<b>Meeting in Detroit, USA</b><br/><br/><b>2.	An Private Online Website/App (GOLD Level) where Members can promote their businesses to all other Gold members, whether locally, nationally or globally.

Only professional messages for business services or products &amp; requests for help will be allowed. The price point will start at $5/mth and up . This is optional and will be offered in beta form starting in March/April 2016 <br/><br/><b>3.	I am planning a private membership for paying members only who are serious and committed to their networking efforts. (PLATINUM level).

</div></div>","Hello Awesome Entrepreneurs:
Do you remember when Rev Martin Luther King said “I have a
dream”?….
Well I have a dream (and I know you do too).
I can’t write or speak as elegantly as the preacher from the
south but I will try to share my idea with you.
The business world as we know it is broken, inefficient
& hostile to newcomers. 
The education system teaches us how to become employees and
not independent business owners free from the tyranny of 9 to 5 hours &
declining salaries.
The world of business networking, advertising &
marketing is a chaotic mess where old fashioned methods of communication are
failing and the newer, more effective messaging is foreign to most people.
In other words, with ""the old boy network"" controlling many networking groups, advertising failing to gain customers and traditional sales  methods receiving poor reception from prospects, most small businesses are struggling to get customers & have to work very hard to survive.



Meeting in Toronto, Canada

We aim to change this…
My dream is to build a network of small business owners,
entrepreneurs and freelancers in hundreds of cities who genuinely want to
connect with kind, friendly & nice “heart-centered” people for the purposes of
building our businesses together. 
My dream is to create a community of business networkers
that…



 Places long term relationships ahead of short
term deals.


 Gives referrals willingly without expectation in
return (Paying it forward)


Wants to form strong bonds of friendship with
other members.


Are trying to build businesses run with the
highest level of character such as honesty, competency & respect.


Wants to give back to the community by teaching
or referring other members.

Have  playful & interesting
conversations in our fun Mix & Mingle networking parties.


I have a ten-year plan to grow our little Smart Success
Business Network from 16,457 members and 300 plus organizers in 95 cities to 1
million members, 2,400 to 5,000 organizers in 800 cities.
We have got an ambitious plan to expand beyond just local Free Meetup groups (which are great for getting started to build connections but don’t give the resources to grow & promote our groups) I propose three levels of membership: 1.	Our current live groups which are free and open to the public (SILVER Level). These are Mix and Mingle Parties to build relationships and are affordable to those on a budget or want to try out networking for the first time. I promise we will continue to improve and design better meetings as we grow. All courses and training on Facebook, LinkedIn & Sales/Marketing for small business will be optional on a pay per user basis. Organizers can learn at this level how to promote, design & schedule their Meetups for maximum success. Members can stay at the Silver level as long as they like with no salesy pressure tactics to upgrade when they are not ready for it. 


Meeting in Detroit, USA2.	An Private Online Website/App (GOLD Level) where Members can promote their businesses to all other Gold members, whether locally, nationally or globally. It’s kind of having a LinkedIn/Gmail account that allows you to broadcast to hundreds or thousands of fellow business owners at all once. Unlike regular emails, all messages will be moderated and screened for appropriate content. Only professional messages for business services or products & requests for help will be allowed. The price point will start at $5/mth and up . This is optional and will be offered in beta form starting in March/April 2016 3.	I am planning a private membership for paying members only who are serious and committed to their networking efforts. (PLATINUM level). Unlike most free Meetups, these Meetings may be in private rooms with experienced speakers, coaches assisting us and bundled training on Facebook & LinkedIn Marketing, CRM (Customer tracking) software training, and soft skills education all included in the membership fee. The price point will be approximately $30 to $50/mth and the revenue generated will allow us to hire staff, pay for training & coaching, cover printing costs, supplies, rent & Meetup.com/other online costs. Our more experienced organizers will run these Meetings. 

Meeting in Providence, USAGrowing Revenue will allow us to promote ourselves on social media and more members joining will create bigger groups at all three levels. We can also create an affiliate program to give supporters an opportunity to earn additional income. The estimated launch date is early 2017. All qualified and active organizers will automatically receive free access the Platinum or Private Meetings (there are special benefits worth hundreds of dollars to being an organizer!) I don’t know if we will bundle the Gold and Platinum levels under one membership – my business partners and I will discuss that possibility. Everyone is free to pick and choose one, two or all three membership levels. Silver membership is free and open to all so Platinum members can attend all live meetings whether free or paid. Gold members can also attend Silver meetings but not Platinum meetings.

Meeting in Hamilton, Canada



Only with such growth can we help the millions of new
business owners that are leaving the corporate world and are scrambling to find
prospective clients & customers.
Yes, it’s going to be difficult (for me & the leadership
team) and some cynical people are going to mock or discount this dream but this
is what I am aiming for. 



Meeting in Leeds, United Kingdom
Of course we can’t do all this without your help.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HELP US GET STARTED?
Our most pressing need this month is fundraising…
and we require about $100 per city for the spring-summer 2016 period
or $9,500 in total. 
So we are accepting donations or contributions to keep the group running, expanding & developing into
something special.
Actually your online contributions means we can have Free meetings open to our members and their guests and we will not require cash donations for several months depending on the total amount given.
We will use the funds received to pay Meetup.com fees, webinar training and supplies for our organizers. 
By helping with contributions, you are making our Meetups free and open to all business people regardless of their economic situation or experience level.



Meeting in Greensboro, USA

Why should you donate?
1) 
You are thanking our hundreds of organizers for
volunteering their time & leading their groups.
2) 
You are thanking Meetup.com for giving a
platform to meet people with common interests.
3) 
You are contributing (or pre-paying) to future events & even
more fantastic networking parties. 
4) 
You are indirectly supporting local bars &
restaurants where we host our Meetups.
5) 
You are supporting a movement that aims to make
business networking fun, affordable and democratic for millions of new
entrepreneurs, freelance and contract workers.
Any support would be appreciated. All supporters may join our Network at no additional cost. Meetups only available in major cities in the USA, Canada, UK, Australia & New Zealand.

Thank you so much (in advance) for all your support.
Sincerely
James Zakaria

<h3>Help Mareg building his own trekking tourism company!</h3>

Lalibela is the heart of the<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> Amhara Region where you can find the source of the Blue Nile river and the highest point in Ethiopia, Ras Dashan (4 543 meters) in the Semien Mountains.  </span>The project aims to give a stable source of income to Mareg and his family creating an alternative option to visit Ethiopia. Mareg is a local tourist guide and he will be happy to show the beauties of his wonderful land.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>A fixed asset of £7 500 is required to have legally registered license from the government. Total start-up expenses are £12 000. If you will contribute to this crowd-funding, we will give to Mareg to have a very solid income. Together with Mareg, we could support as well the young student of the elementary school of ""Duhalika"". The difficulties are many even because it is remotely located, 65 km far from Lalibela in the mount Abuna Yosef. Part of the funding of this campaign is dedicated to economically help the school in the education of its students. The visit of the mount Abuna Yosef and the school are part of trekking tours. During the visit, Mareg will carry goods for the school, such as books, pens, clothes and, if we collect enough money, we can buy chairs and desks for these little students.</p>

<h3>LALIBELA</h3>
<p>Lalibela has history and mystery engraved in its stones, it has a deep soul with the rites and awe of Christianity at its most ancient and unbending. It is well-known not only as a UNESCO World Heritage site but also as a true world wonder. <br/>In Lalibela, you will find some of the most famous Ethiopians Rock Hewn churches, mostly referred to as ""the living wonders of the world"". These churches, built at least 900 years, are an active Christian shrine, the spiritual center of religious life. The monolithic churches were carved out of 2 600 square meters of natural rock during the 12th century by King Lalibela. The churches' landscape and religious sites have been wisely designed to recreate Jerusalem. The churches are clustered in two major groups, one representing the earthly Jerusalem, and the other representing the heavenly Jerusalem.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540469795/gygwdtszutauvbm4u1xr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>GONDAR</h3>
<p>When traveling in Gondar – it almost seems like being in Medieval Europe. It is also said that J.R.R.

</div></div>","Help Mareg building his own trekking tourism company!
Thousands of tourist visit Lalibela in Ethiopia each year and use the area as a gateway to the surrounding region. Lalibela is the heart of the Amhara Region where you can find the source of the Blue Nile river and the highest point in Ethiopia, Ras Dashan (4 543 meters) in the Semien Mountains.  The project aims to give a stable source of income to Mareg and his family creating an alternative option to visit Ethiopia. Mareg is a local tourist guide and he will be happy to show the beauties of his wonderful land. 

What We Need & What You Get
A fixed asset of £7 500 is required to have legally registered license from the government. Total start-up expenses are £12 000. If you will contribute to this crowd-funding, we will give to Mareg to have a very solid income. Together with Mareg, we could support as well the young student of the elementary school of ""Duhalika"". The difficulties are many even because it is remotely located, 65 km far from Lalibela in the mount Abuna Yosef. Part of the funding of this campaign is dedicated to economically help the school in the education of its students. The visit of the mount Abuna Yosef and the school are part of trekking tours. During the visit, Mareg will carry goods for the school, such as books, pens, clothes and, if we collect enough money, we can buy chairs and desks for these little students.

</div></div>","THEY VS WE 

They

Think social media is too confusing for you to understand
Think that big names equal success

We

Know that we can teach you WHILE we deliver results
Know that results equal success





WHO ARE WE? The Plutocrats Club is an holistic advertising agency run by millennials. 
Can we agree that advertising is expensive? Trust us, we know. That's why we have been working multiple jobs, so you don't have to.
Did you know?
Creating a comprehensive strategy for social media marketing and outsourcing all work for all channels (with a minimum of two social networks) costs anywhere from $3,000-$20,000 per month, with the industry average settling between $4,000-$7,000?
We deliver results longer, better and for lower prices. 


For some, advertising stops after the last dollar is spent on a billboard ad. For Plutocrats, it never stops. 
Once we place you in one of our curated communities or select you for an experience, exposure and promotion become limitless. Our consulting services are just icing on the cake.


It is no coincidence that our CEO is named David, because we compete against advertising Goliaths everyday. You can trust that we have the stones to prevail. 
This campaign is a culmination of the innovative strides we have taken for over 3 years to create more value than ever before. 


   OUR PERK BREAKDOWN 
You can tell by the perks that we are offering, that this is no ordinary campaign. We even used our crowdfunding campaign to support our growing network. That's how committed we are. 
Each of the perks we provided are partnerships with real members of our communities, real organizations that we belong to, and real Millennials looking to take their services to the next level. When we say next level connections we mean it.

WHERE WILL THE MONEY GO?
We know what you are thinking. $70,000 who, what, and where is that money going to, and why do they need it? Don't worry, we've got you covered.

A consistent place to ride year round, no matter what the weather 
A safe space for local youth to ride and socialize
A comfortable place for families to try out skateboarding
Programs for kids including camps, classes, and after-school care
Affordable, healthy food options
A skate shop with knowledgeable staff and great products
A venue for parties, contests, all ages concerts, and other events
   The park design will include:
Street inspired ledges, rails, and hips
Transitioned quarter pipes
A mini ramp or a bowl
Banked ramps of all sizes
Moveable small street elements
Small to medium sized ramps that are fun for all abilities

Ikhaya le Langa, meaning House of the Sun in isiXhosa, is a not-for-profit social enterprise working to turn this hidden cultural gem into a must-see spot for local Capetonians and tourists alike. Aiming to combat the historic community’s deep poverty by highlighting and celebrating the vibrant heritage of Cape Town’s oldest township, Ikhaya le Langa is creating jobs, fostering sustainable business and development, and engaging in socially responsible tourism. Founded in 2013 by Social Enterprise Practitioner Tony Elvin, Ikhaya le Langa is helping to transition the Langa Quarter into a clean, green, and safe neighborhood. </p><p>And into this foray comes the Sun Diner. Four years in the making, the Sun Diner will soon be a hot spot for a quick breakfast meeting or a causal social lunch. With a sustainable business model, the Sun Diner will employ and teach local members of the Langa community, while offering a social hub and incredible dining experience to both tourists and locals. Boosting the community’s economy, the Sun Diner will allow Langa’s historical neighbourhood the opportunity to thrive. Conveniently located seconds off Cape Town’s main highway, the Sun Diner is designed to attract the majority of white Capetonians who have never been into a predominantly black township such as Langa. The Sun Diner is <i>the</i> place to be, closing the gap between racial communities and stereotypes with great food and better people.</p><p>The Sun Diner will not only serve as a community brunch hot spot; it is a three-branch sustainable social enterprise created for the collective people, planet, and profit.</p><p><strong>People:</strong></p><ul>
<li>Ambassador Social Inclusion Program: supporting the long term unemployed and giving them skills and schedules to encourage work </li>
<li>Hospitality Training: Training baristas, waiters, and chefs to be fit for the workforce</li>
<li>Community development: breaking down the racial by crafting a space for white Capetonians to engage in a black area</li>
</ul><p><strong>Planet:</strong></p><ul>
<li>Foodbank SA partnership: transforming surplus supermarket foods into free, nutritious meals for resident volunteers in need of food</li>
<li>Reducing food waste: allocating safe surplus food to ambassadors within the Langa Quarter through Foodbank SA partnership</li>
<li>Minimizing footprint: increasing community volunteering leading to a cleaner, greener environment</li>
</ul><p><strong>Profit:</strong></p><ul>
<li>Sustainable business model: as a social enterprise and a non-for-profit, the Sun Diner brings business into the community, for the community</li>
<li>Platform for partners: the Sun Diner's partnership with the major grocery chain, Pic N Pay, will allow for us to feed community, overseas local and resident volunteers for free. </li>
</ul><p><strong>The Big Picture</strong></p><p><strong>Milestone 1: $60,000</strong></p><p>To make this dream a reality we need your help!

Ikhaya le Langa, meaning House of the Sun in isiXhosa, is a not-for-profit social enterprise working to turn this hidden cultural gem into a must-see spot for local Capetonians and tourists alike. Aiming to combat the historic community’s deep poverty by highlighting and celebrating the vibrant heritage of Cape Town’s oldest township, Ikhaya le Langa is creating jobs, fostering sustainable business and development, and engaging in socially responsible tourism. Founded in 2013 by Social Enterprise Practitioner Tony Elvin, Ikhaya le Langa is helping to transition the Langa Quarter into a clean, green, and safe neighborhood. And into this foray comes the Sun Diner. Four years in the making, the Sun Diner will soon be a hot spot for a quick breakfast meeting or a causal social lunch. With a sustainable business model, the Sun Diner will employ and teach local members of the Langa community, while offering a social hub and incredible dining experience to both tourists and locals. Boosting the community’s economy, the Sun Diner will allow Langa’s historical neighbourhood the opportunity to thrive. Conveniently located seconds off Cape Town’s main highway, the Sun Diner is designed to attract the majority of white Capetonians who have never been into a predominantly black township such as Langa. The Sun Diner is the place to be, closing the gap between racial communities and stereotypes with great food and better people.The Sun Diner will not only serve as a community brunch hot spot; it is a three-branch sustainable social enterprise created for the collective people, planet, and profit.People:
Ambassador Social Inclusion Program: supporting the long term unemployed and giving them skills and schedules to encourage work 
Hospitality Training: Training baristas, waiters, and chefs to be fit for the workforce
Community development: breaking down the racial by crafting a space for white Capetonians to engage in a black area
Planet:
Foodbank SA partnership: transforming surplus supermarket foods into free, nutritious meals for resident volunteers in need of food
Reducing food waste: allocating safe surplus food to ambassadors within the Langa Quarter through Foodbank SA partnership
Minimizing footprint: increasing community volunteering leading to a cleaner, greener environment
Profit:
Sustainable business model: as a social enterprise and a non-for-profit, the Sun Diner brings business into the community, for the community
Platform for partners: the Sun Diner's partnership with the major grocery chain, Pic N Pay, will allow for us to feed community, overseas local and resident volunteers for free.

THE IMPACT
OT for Children with Disabilities in a Sensory Gym. 
OTs play a significant role in intervention for children with disabilities.  Many children with special needs experience sensory processing disorder (SPD).
What is SPD?  

 It can be described as a  ẗraffic jam¨ that prevents part of the brain from adequately receiving and interpreting sensory information. It causes children to respond inappropriately to sensory input  
A child with SPD may be  over responsive- the child may attack a friend or relative, cry, in response to a  sensory experience such as light touch, movement(vestibular input) hearing certain sounds or any other sensory input.
A child may  be under-responsive  where sensory information does not arouse their nervous systems- and they crave intense stimulation. They may spin excessively, crash into walls, climb onto furniture ,jump on couches, etc.

Untreated SPD may result in clumsiness, anxiety, depression, social behavioral issues, school failure, and other impacts.  
OT  Intervention for SPD
OTs are skilled and licensed professionals who can ​customize play in a separate space(sensory gym) to “rewire” the brain so that children with special needs can appropriately integrate and respond to sensory input.  For instance, a child who is over-responsive  to movement (vestibular input) would gradually be exposed to swinging on a swing , rolling on a scooter etc.  in order to retrain the brain and produce an appropriate response .
Overtime an appropriate response to sensory information will be generalized to participation in  normal activities within other environments( i.e. home, school, and community).  

Open Play at Chasing Jax
Play allows for sensory experiences that are vital to all children´s growth and development. Open play equipment at Chasing Jax will stimulate the senses of children,  increase muscle strength, joint flexibility, endurance,  gross/fine motor skills and much more.

Before any barley, wheat, or other grain makes its way into a brewery, it is steeped in water, germinated, and kilned- a process known as malting. Malt is the backbone and soul of beer and much of a beer's quality, flavor and aroma is created during the malting process.  Only a handful of malting companies around the world still practice the art of floor-malting, wherein the grain is allowed to germinate in a thin layer and is gently turned, rather than piled deep in a mechanical vessel. Floor-malted grain is revered by brewers and distillers for its flavor and character. Admiral Maltings will combine these traditional methods with modern quality control technology to produce consistently distinctive malt.</p><p>Much of the malt used in the US is imported and craft breweries often look to Germany and England for premium quality malt. Admiral Maltings is part of a growing nationwide movement to diversify and improve the domestic malt supply for craft breweries and distilleries.  Before Prohibition, malt houses were common all over the US, sourcing locally grown barley, and selling to local and regional breweries. The current malt supply, however, primarily reflects the needs of the largest, non-craft breweries.  It is now necessary, as the Brewers Association states, “that the barley malt supply chain should . . . evolve rapidly to meet the very different needs of all-malt [craft] beer brewers.” </p><p>Outside of California, there are already a growing number of craft malting businesses. The Craft Maltsters Guild lists 32 companies currently in production in North America, and at least another 30 in planning. As the first major craft malting facility in California, Admiral Maltings will offer craft brewers and distillers premium malt with the following advantages:</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Improved flavor</strong>: Our malt is made using traditional floor-malting methods and delivered fresh from the kiln, providing optimum flavor. Our small- scale allows us to offer custom-kilned malts made with new, unique, and experimental grain varieties.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Locally sourced:</strong> Brewers strengthen their ties to the community and reduce their carbon footprint by supporting local farmers.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Sustainably grown</strong>: All of Admiral’s grains are grown using organic or no-till practices which promote soil health. Barley and other grains require little to no irrigation. By using locally grown grains, brewers provide a new market for crops that are well suited to California’s arid climate.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p><h3>Sounds cool, but I'm not a brewer...</h3><p>In addition to producing malt, we will also open an <i><strong>onsite restaurant and pub</strong></i> to serve beer and spirits that are made with Admiral malt. So while most of you reading this may not want to geek out with us over the protein content and kilning profile of our newest pilsner malt, you will be able to enjoy a pint of your favorite local beer and know that you had a part in changing the way it was made.</p><p> </p><h3>Who is behind Admiral Maltings?</h3><p><strong>Ron Silberstein</strong>, owner and founding brewmaster of ThirstyBear Organic Brewery.

Find our bio’s on our (work-in-progress) website (<a href=""https://www.gatherandmill.com/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.gatherandmill.com/about/</a>).</p><p><strong>Where is it?</strong> Our brick &amp; mortar shop and workshop space is located in the Sierra Nevada foothills between the Bay Area &amp; Tahoe in the historic town of Grass Valley (where artistically and musically-inclined spirits seem to flock, due to the stunning surroundings and peaceful environment). We’re located a few blocks out of town at 603 Mill St, Grass Valley, CA 95945 at the intersection of hwy 20 &amp; 49. We also have an online space (<a href=""https://www.gatherandmill.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.gatherandmill.com</a>) to sign up for classes, purchase unique goods and to be inspired.</p><p><strong>Why this project?</strong> Over the years, we have both dreamed of having a retail space that could be shared with a community of like-minded people. The perfect unique space became available and we jumped at the opportunity. We’ve worked together on numerous styled wedding shoots and mini sessions in the past and have found that we work together seamlessly. We have been blown away by the similarity of our visions with the shop and workshop classes. And we’re truly thrilled to bring this project to the community.</p><p><strong>What do we need?</strong> Well, we need funding to get our vision off the ground! We will use this funding for our start up costs and the first months operating expenses. The majority of the funds will be put towards the rent, deposit and improvements to the building such as lighting, paint and a flower box redo. We will also need to purchase pieces for the retail shop and workshop space such as shelving, signage, collateral and workshop tables. Then there’s all the behind the scenes pieces like websites, fonts, printers, software &amp; licenses. And if there are any funds leftover, we will invest this in inventory for the retail shop or for surprise expenses, because we expect there will be some even though we have diligently gone through our start up costs &amp; operating expenses.</p><p>There will be 3 main channels for our business structure: a retail shop, workshops and a venue space. We’ll start with monthly “pop-up” shops (stay tuned on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/gatherandmill"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a> &amp; <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/gatherandmill/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram</a>) while we curate the product mix for our shop. Then after 3-6 months we’ll grow into a retail shop that is open daily. We plan to highlight local creatives as instructors for the workshops as well as their products in the shop when applicable. We are currently taking applications for workshop instructors, pop-up shop bookings and consignment vendors. Our consignment vendors will be hand selected by us to reflect our aesthetic and vision. If you're interested in selling consignment in our shop, please fill out the form on our contact page. The venue space will be developed more after we launch the business.

Find our bio’s on our (work-in-progress) website (https://www.gatherandmill.com/about/).Where is it? Our brick & mortar shop and workshop space is located in the Sierra Nevada foothills between the Bay Area & Tahoe in the historic town of Grass Valley (where artistically and musically-inclined spirits seem to flock, due to the stunning surroundings and peaceful environment). We’re located a few blocks out of town at 603 Mill St, Grass Valley, CA 95945 at the intersection of hwy 20 & 49. We also have an online space (www.gatherandmill.com) to sign up for classes, purchase unique goods and to be inspired.Why this project? Over the years, we have both dreamed of having a retail space that could be shared with a community of like-minded people. The perfect unique space became available and we jumped at the opportunity. We’ve worked together on numerous styled wedding shoots and mini sessions in the past and have found that we work together seamlessly. We have been blown away by the similarity of our visions with the shop and workshop classes. And we’re truly thrilled to bring this project to the community.What do we need? Well, we need funding to get our vision off the ground! We will use this funding for our start up costs and the first months operating expenses. The majority of the funds will be put towards the rent, deposit and improvements to the building such as lighting, paint and a flower box redo. We will also need to purchase pieces for the retail shop and workshop space such as shelving, signage, collateral and workshop tables. Then there’s all the behind the scenes pieces like websites, fonts, printers, software & licenses. And if there are any funds leftover, we will invest this in inventory for the retail shop or for surprise expenses, because we expect there will be some even though we have diligently gone through our start up costs & operating expenses.There will be 3 main channels for our business structure: a retail shop, workshops and a venue space. We’ll start with monthly “pop-up” shops (stay tuned on Facebook & Instagram) while we curate the product mix for our shop. Then after 3-6 months we’ll grow into a retail shop that is open daily. We plan to highlight local creatives as instructors for the workshops as well as their products in the shop when applicable. We are currently taking applications for workshop instructors, pop-up shop bookings and consignment vendors. Our consignment vendors will be hand selected by us to reflect our aesthetic and vision. If you're interested in selling consignment in our shop, please fill out the form on our contact page. The venue space will be developed more after we launch the business. We’d also love to hear what events and workshops you would like to see here and how we can help make your affair a successful experience. Send us an email at hello@gatherandmill.com - we can’t wait to hear from you!Cheers! Katie & Erica",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Our Story</h2>
<br/><p>So how did we come up with the idea of SoWhat Seeds? Well, it all stemmed from the teams passions for travelling and trying new things. Our managing director, Vicky McIvor, was busy telling the team about her latest travelling adventures when she stopped mid-sentence and uttered the words ""exotic herbs"" and from that point on, our lives were changed.</p>
<p>We threw ourselves into seed trials and were chuffed when we saw the little green shoots peeping over the top of the plant pot. After that we went and pitched our idea to 4 terrifying business men and women and managed to secure a £2000 investment!</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457975555/rtewrx5pi1e3pdsxvakn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>SoWhat did we do with the money? We created our first three seed boxes of course! From our current range you can pick yourselves up the electrifying Buzz Buttons, the scrumptious Shiso or the chefs favourite, Culantro! All three of our seed boxes contain the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A sachet of exotic seeds</p></li>
<li>
<p></p>
<p>7 coir discs</p>
</li>
<li><p>10g of Neem mixed in with a bag of Perlite</p></li>
<li><p>A postcard giving you information about your herb and planting instructions</p></li>
<li><p>And a nice fabric pot for you to put it all in</p></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>We've been in business just over 3 months and have already
sold over 100 boxes! Not to mention gathered a whopper of a following on our
social media. If you're on Facebook or twitter check us out using the links
below, don't forget to check out our website too!</p>
<p>One of the best bits about our product is that all of the profit (that's right 100%) goes to our partner charity Rainforest Trust! </p>

<h2>SoWhat do we need your money for?</h2>
<p>Well it turns out that setting up a business in exotic herbs is realllllly expensive, especially when you're trying to bring some pretty cool and exotic herbs into the U.K. Although we've already got three products on the shelf we're busy putting the finishing touches to a further two exciting herb boxes. </p>
<p>We're trying to raise £500 and here's what we're planning on spending it on:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>£150 on R&amp;D to make our products the best they can be for our customers</p></li>
<li><p>£100 on developing new recipe's (check out our recipe maker, Gumblossom, she's amazing <a href=""http://www.sowhatseeds.com/gumblossom)."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.sowhatseeds.com/gumblossom).</a></p></li>
<li><p>£150 on marketing, we're going to hire the best graphic designer we can find to help develop our website and marketing campaigns (any takers?)</p></li>
<li><p>£100 to help us establish a presence at stalls over the U.K this year (we'll hopefully meet some of you face to face!)</p></li>

Located just off the 77 freeway, and tucked into the heart of the corridor between Huntersville + Mooresville, we are thrilled to bring together the talented and dynamic women of Lake Norman!</p><p>Working from home is isolating, leading to slower business growth and a slew of distractions. Coterie provides a supportive community for entrepreneurs and freelancers who want a space to work, connect with peers and collaborate. Members will enjoy our fun, relaxed atmosphere with perks that include beautiful spaces, drop in work stations, a lounge area for collaboration, state of the art conference suite and a fully stocked kitchen to gather + snack on healthy treats, fair trade coffee and oodles more. </p><p><strong>The Power of Community:</strong></p><p>What happens in Lake Norman is important. We have the privilege of living in one of the most resource rich areas of our beautiful state. Developing relationships with our local and regional assets, in an effort to benefit each member, is one of our biggest focuses here at Coterie. Growing our local economy through small business is not only good for our members, it’s good for the community. To that end, we will host a monthly event that highlights local assets, with opportunities for each member to plug in and move their business forward. </p><p>Designed to create a marriage of peaceful + creative opportunity for community, our co-working space will offer a mix of independent space for closing deals, community space that encourage classroom style presentations, a kitchen that serves as the heart of our Coterie home, and an outdoor space that allows for fresh air + a little Vitamin D therapy.</p><p><strong>Why Female Focused?</strong></p><p>Women empowering women is more than just a theory. In a Kaufman Foundation study (“Are Successful Women Entrepreneurs Different from Men?” May 2010), women rated their professional and business networks as important contributors to success more highly than men did. It was also found that women especially benefit from other types of social support and encouragement beyond business.</p><p>Several of the identified gender differences in the study indicate that support and encouragement from key people can especially benefit women in their efforts to found successful companies. Many women feel more comfortable in an all-woman environment and typically get to a point of trust much quicker, especially in a safe, supportive environment like Coterie. </p><p>Women helping women should not be a revolutionary event. We will demonstrate how working together, supporting each other and actively advancing the vision of the women of this community will contribute to the culture and economy of Charlotte.</p><p>For more on the benefits of co-working, please enjoy this video: <a href=""https://youtu.be/le0dfcG_jVw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://youtu.be/le0dfcG_jVw</a></p><p><strong>Our Standard of Giving®</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p>What happens to one of us affects all of us.

<br/></div>","Coterie offers an environment like no other, with a dynamic, supportive membership of like-minded freelancers, artists and entrepreneurs. a space that boasts a design-savvy, curated interior, a secure digital environment with a unique user fingerprint for each member, + countless professional services,  we provide each member with connections to business experts, access to educational workshops, and exposure within their chosen market. Discover how working as part of the community can help everyone thrive. 
Small businesses + entrepreneurs in the U.S. currently provide 50% of existing jobs, and 60% to 80% of new jobs. Remarkably, this is accomplished against almost insurmountable odds. Noisy coffee shops, sketchy internet access, isolation from like-minded individuals, expensive equipment, and ridiculously priced studio rentals are just some of the frustrations and hurdles to overcome when trying to build a successful business. Lake Norman is fast becoming a hotbed of innovation, entrepreneurship and meaningful communion. Whether you are a small business owner, freelancer, designer, writer, artist, or any other kind of entrepreneur, we are certain that you and your business will thrive in the nurturing, inspiring, collaborative world of Coterie Lake Norman. Located just off the 77 freeway, and tucked into the heart of the corridor between Huntersville + Mooresville, we are thrilled to bring together the talented and dynamic women of Lake Norman!Working from home is isolating, leading to slower business growth and a slew of distractions. Coterie provides a supportive community for entrepreneurs and freelancers who want a space to work, connect with peers and collaborate. Members will enjoy our fun, relaxed atmosphere with perks that include beautiful spaces, drop in work stations, a lounge area for collaboration, state of the art conference suite and a fully stocked kitchen to gather + snack on healthy treats, fair trade coffee and oodles more. The Power of Community:What happens in Lake Norman is important. We have the privilege of living in one of the most resource rich areas of our beautiful state. Developing relationships with our local and regional assets, in an effort to benefit each member, is one of our biggest focuses here at Coterie. Growing our local economy through small business is not only good for our members, it’s good for the community. To that end, we will host a monthly event that highlights local assets, with opportunities for each member to plug in and move their business forward. Designed to create a marriage of peaceful + creative opportunity for community, our co-working space will offer a mix of independent space for closing deals, community space that encourage classroom style presentations, a kitchen that serves as the heart of our Coterie home, and an outdoor space that allows for fresh air + a little Vitamin D therapy.Why Female Focused?Women empowering women is more than just a theory. In a Kaufman Foundation study (“Are Successful Women Entrepreneurs Different from Men?” May 2010), women rated their professional and business networks as important contributors to success more highly than men did. It was also found that women especially benefit from other types of social support and encouragement beyond business.Several of the identified gender differences in the study indicate that support and encouragement from key people can especially benefit women in their efforts to found successful companies. Many women feel more comfortable in an all-woman environment and typically get to a point of trust much quicker, especially in a safe, supportive environment like Coterie. Women helping women should not be a revolutionary event. We will demonstrate how working together, supporting each other and actively advancing the vision of the women of this community will contribute to the culture and economy of Charlotte.For more on the benefits of co-working, please enjoy this video: https://youtu.be/le0dfcG_jVwOur Standard of Giving®:What happens to one of us affects all of us. When you become a member of Coterie, we invest a portion of the proceeds in initiatives that combat the global water crisis, help in the fight against hunger, aide our local women + children and help end human trafficking. For years, Women Who RISE + Joanna Bailey Designs {the parent company of this endeavor} have worked tirelessly to support organizations that make a difference in the lives of others. We believe that it is our responsibility to play a role in advancing the lives of others and to amplify the great work of as many innovators and disruptors as we can. After all, that’s how we make things happen. Bold moves + brave choices. 10% of our net profits go to either Water.org, Free The Girls, Feeding America or a local organization working to keep Charlotte women + children safe. {we will cycle quarterly}In addition, we give 10% of our memberships to local women who are ready to launch their vision, but unable to purchase a membership. If you would like to nominate a new member based on need, please email us at give@coterielkn.com.Perks! Here's the Skinny...$75   Coterie Fan

<h4><b>*Add a little to a little and there will be a
great heap. </b></h4><p></p><p>If you’ve been to the Creek Monkey you know
who we are.  We’re just a bunch of crazy
kids that run around naked and scream punk rock lyrics at the top of our
lungs.  Well not so much on the outside,
but that’s what’s happening on the inside. 
However, with the help of the community, we have created something
outwardly visible, that we are proud of and want to expand.  We love the community that’s risen around the
Monkey, and we make good beer, but we want to take it to the next level and
make even better beer, and more of it! 
To do so we need a larger facility.</p>
<h3>What We Want To Do</h3><p>If we hit our funding goals we can take out
the loans necessary to put a full production facility in Martinez but it’s a
million dollar play and we can’t do it alone. 
The money you contribute will be used as part of the down payment on loans from the
Small Business Administration.  We will
use the funds from those loans to purchase approximately $500,000 in equipment
and use the rest to build out the brewery space and install all of the equipment
we purchase, as well as, a tap room (seen below). There will also be a small
amount held back for operating expenses until the brewery becomes
self-sufficient. This larger facility will allow us to produce enough beer to supply our
needs and the needs of the surrounding community so we can really get the
Rocksteady name out.  Even if we don’t hit our funding
goal for the campaign we will still apply the funds we do get to our down payment
fund and it will just take us a while longer to get there.  We are fully committed to the community of
Martinez because you’ve already committed to us.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448065180/dbaf6dn0w05o9j88jwxn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<h3>What You Get</h3><p>In exchange for helping us out we have a load
of really cool swag that Sarah’s been designing to give to you. Check out the merch gallery at <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/beer-in-the-exotic-east-bay-rocksteady-brewing-co/x/12277152#/gallery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/beer-in-the-...</a> . In addition, we have events planned that
should be fun for everyone.  Want to brew
your own beer and roll it out like a big beer CEO?  You can do that.  Want to party with 50 of your closest friends
in your own brewery for the day?  You can
do that.  Want to make Brayden your
personal slave for a day?  You can do
that (keep it quiet until we let Brayden know.) 
If you don’t see anything that tickles your fancy, send us an email and
we can create something custom.  It’s
sort of like a PBS pledge drive, but for the cool kids.</p><h3>Becoming a Part of the Community</h3><p>At Creek Monkey we’ve been able to
successfully continue to grow despite the pitfalls that all restaurants face. We know that the brewery will only solidify
our placement in the community and we want you to be a part of it.  With your help we can become a true institution
known throughout the Diablo Valley.</p>
<p>This is obviously not without risk. There is competition growing in the brewing
world.  We’re fortunate to be a part of a
much larger artisan movement that is sweeping the United States.  We know we can continue to improve on what
we’ve done with Creek Monkey and truly create a product in the Rocksteady space
that will hold its own with any brewery out there.  We certainly expect to see Rocksteady on
tap throughout the east bay but our real goal is to expand on our hospitality
offerings throughout the Diablo Valley. We will be able to offer equity positions to people to join us on those
expansions, thanks to the passage of the Jobs Act. However, the lynchpin of the
company will always be the brewery and that brewery, the company flagship, will
be rightfully located in the County Seat of Martinez, California. The combination of Creek Monkey Tap House and
the Rocksteady Brewery will solidify Martinez’s place in the Craft Beer world.</p><div>

</div></div>","Adde parvum parvo magnus acervus erit!* -Ovid
*Add a little to a little and there will be a
great heap. If you’ve been to the Creek Monkey you know
who we are.  We’re just a bunch of crazy
kids that run around naked and scream punk rock lyrics at the top of our
lungs.  Well not so much on the outside,
but that’s what’s happening on the inside. 
However, with the help of the community, we have created something
outwardly visible, that we are proud of and want to expand.  We love the community that’s risen around the
Monkey, and we make good beer, but we want to take it to the next level and
make even better beer, and more of it! 
To do so we need a larger facility.
What We Want To DoIf we hit our funding goals we can take out
the loans necessary to put a full production facility in Martinez but it’s a
million dollar play and we can’t do it alone. 
The money you contribute will be used as part of the down payment on loans from the
Small Business Administration.  We will
use the funds from those loans to purchase approximately $500,000 in equipment
and use the rest to build out the brewery space and install all of the equipment
we purchase, as well as, a tap room (seen below). There will also be a small
amount held back for operating expenses until the brewery becomes
self-sufficient. This larger facility will allow us to produce enough beer to supply our
needs and the needs of the surrounding community so we can really get the
Rocksteady name out.  Even if we don’t hit our funding
goal for the campaign we will still apply the funds we do get to our down payment
fund and it will just take us a while longer to get there.  We are fully committed to the community of
Martinez because you’ve already committed to us.
What You GetIn exchange for helping us out we have a load
of really cool swag that Sarah’s been designing to give to you. Check out the merch gallery at https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/beer-in-the-... . In addition, we have events planned that
should be fun for everyone.  Want to brew
your own beer and roll it out like a big beer CEO?  You can do that.  Want to party with 50 of your closest friends
in your own brewery for the day?  You can
do that.  Want to make Brayden your
personal slave for a day?  You can do
that (keep it quiet until we let Brayden know.) 
If you don’t see anything that tickles your fancy, send us an email and
we can create something custom.  It’s
sort of like a PBS pledge drive, but for the cool kids.Becoming a Part of the CommunityAt Creek Monkey we’ve been able to
successfully continue to grow despite the pitfalls that all restaurants face. We know that the brewery will only solidify
our placement in the community and we want you to be a part of it.  With your help we can become a true institution
known throughout the Diablo Valley.
This is obviously not without risk. There is competition growing in the brewing
world.  We’re fortunate to be a part of a
much larger artisan movement that is sweeping the United States.  We know we can continue to improve on what
we’ve done with Creek Monkey and truly create a product in the Rocksteady space
that will hold its own with any brewery out there.  We certainly expect to see Rocksteady on
tap throughout the east bay but our real goal is to expand on our hospitality
offerings throughout the Diablo Valley. We will be able to offer equity positions to people to join us on those
expansions, thanks to the passage of the Jobs Act. However, the lynchpin of the
company will always be the brewery and that brewery, the company flagship, will
be rightfully located in the County Seat of Martinez, California. The combination of Creek Monkey Tap House and
the Rocksteady Brewery will solidify Martinez’s place in the Craft Beer world.

<p>Beyond staffing and organizing expenses, we need your donation to be able to pay pre-season expenses such as permits, insurance, and promotional materials. Capital and operational funds for tents, sound equipment and our favorite, the Port-o-potties, need to be secured well before the season begins.  </p>
<p><b>Below are some of our estimated expenses leading up to the 2016 MCB season </b><i>(You will notice our expenses far exceed our goal.  Once our applications are live we will begin to bring in vendor fees to cover some of our expenses that will not be due until closer to the kick off of our season)</i><b>:</b></p>

<p>$1000 Tents (last year we blew through (literally 20 mph winds are hard on cheep tents).  This year we plan on upgrading to tents with warranties and maybe our logo!)</p>
<p>$2500 Musicians and performers </p>

</div><p>   I, Michael Wayne Maris, was born in Los Angeles California on July 4th 1977. I am an independent artist with a passion for drawing, painting, airbrushing, sculpting, and graphic design.  I also have a passion for writing stories, books, poetry and lyrics. I have an AA Degree from Brooks College in Long Beach, California for Graphic Design. I have over thirteen years of experience in graphics, designing business cards, logos, flyers, websites, postcards, clothing, and more. I have over twenty years of airbrushing experience painting murals, clothing, and youth sports banners.</p><p>     I learned the hard way how artists are treated and taken advantage of, which forced me to take a step back and focus on the business side of being an artist. Seeing the state of our economy also contributed to me forming many ideas and different ways to do business as an artist.  I figured in these hard times small business and community need to thrive more then ever and in figuring this out i had a vision. It's a big vision… <b>A MONSTA VIZION</b>. </p><p>     Up to this point i have done things mostly on my own, but to expand and grow the vision i have I need help. That is where contributions will play a big factor in moving to the next level. Helping with promotional items, materials, and acquiring a team of fellow artists and personnel. </p><p>    In a business sense, THE MONSTA VIZION is the corporation that many smaller ideas/companies can call it home. I am only asking for funding in the amount of $3,000 to help grow the first three ideas within my vision. Evenly divided that would make the funding for each idea $1,000. </p><p><b>Monsta Designs:</b>…has been designing every idea within The Monsta Vizion as well as doing graphics for individuals and small businesses. I have made some great customers and keep things simple when it comes to the amount of business Monsta Designs can handle, but now it is time to evolve from the state of 'Monsta,' and if funding is met, Monsta Designs will grow into <b>The Fenix Design Firm</b>. Funding will help with bringing in part time and intern graphic designers, part time office personnel, and promotional materials geared to reaching out into the community and expanding business. (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/monstadesigns77/photos_stream?tab=photos_albums"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MONSTA DESIGNS ONLINE PORTFOLIO</a>)</p><p>Monsta Banners:…provides custom airbrushed sports banners for youth teams in soccer, baseball, and softball. I have over fifteen years experience airbrushing sports banners and one of the greatest things is watching the face of a team seeing their banner for the first time. The compliments are great and I have always tried to be creative when painting but what sets my banners from the next guy is pricing. Parents have to fork out alot of money to sign kids up, get equipment, and even travel sometimes. I know from experience how stressful getting a banner can be for a parent when all they want is to give the kids something cool to represent their team. I only charge five dollars per player on a team so if the team has nine players the price is forty-five dollars. This makes the price fluxuate from team to team but I make up for it all with volume.

I am an independent artist with a passion for drawing, painting, airbrushing, sculpting, and graphic design.  I also have a passion for writing stories, books, poetry and lyrics. I have an AA Degree from Brooks College in Long Beach, California for Graphic Design. I have over thirteen years of experience in graphics, designing business cards, logos, flyers, websites, postcards, clothing, and more. I have over twenty years of airbrushing experience painting murals, clothing, and youth sports banners.     I learned the hard way how artists are treated and taken advantage of, which forced me to take a step back and focus on the business side of being an artist. Seeing the state of our economy also contributed to me forming many ideas and different ways to do business as an artist.  I figured in these hard times small business and community need to thrive more then ever and in figuring this out i had a vision. It's a big vision… A MONSTA VIZION.      Up to this point i have done things mostly on my own, but to expand and grow the vision i have I need help. That is where contributions will play a big factor in moving to the next level. Helping with promotional items, materials, and acquiring a team of fellow artists and personnel.     In a business sense, THE MONSTA VIZION is the corporation that many smaller ideas/companies can call it home. I am only asking for funding in the amount of $3,000 to help grow the first three ideas within my vision. Evenly divided that would make the funding for each idea $1,000. Monsta Designs:…has been designing every idea within The Monsta Vizion as well as doing graphics for individuals and small businesses. I have made some great customers and keep things simple when it comes to the amount of business Monsta Designs can handle, but now it is time to evolve from the state of 'Monsta,' and if funding is met, Monsta Designs will grow into The Fenix Design Firm. Funding will help with bringing in part time and intern graphic designers, part time office personnel, and promotional materials geared to reaching out into the community and expanding business. (MONSTA DESIGNS ONLINE PORTFOLIO)Monsta Banners:…provides custom airbrushed sports banners for youth teams in soccer, baseball, and softball. I have over fifteen years experience airbrushing sports banners and one of the greatest things is watching the face of a team seeing their banner for the first time.

<li>We also have witnessed the ""lightening"" speed of our athletes at Olympics and World Championship events, but not enough is known of the Culinary talents of the Jamaican People and some of the delicious dishes, unless you were already a visitor to the Island or have eaten at a Jamaican Restaurant. Usually Caribbean Restaurants in America are usually limited to a few dishes they serve. Being born in the Island of Jamaica and migrating here to the United States 18 years ago, I not only took my knowledge in fine Arts here with me but also my knowledge of the Culinary dishes, their history and tastes. Jamaica a Caribbean Island is blessed with one of the widest variety of fruits and more than twenty different type of mangoes.</li>
<li> Much of my cooking and baking talents are learned from my Mother and Grandmother, and I would like to share most of this knowledge by making available, Jamaican snacks, pastries and dishes available for you to taste. I am sure you will enjoy another of the hidden beauties of the Island of Jamaica, because we are not only blessed with our most popular dish Jerk Chicken. There is so much more for you to enjoy of Jamaican Culinary Cuisine.

Potrebbe dare il benvenuto ai suoi ospiti e allo stesso tempo passare del tempo con suo figlio. I soldi di cui abbiamo bisogno non sono molti, e questo è come intendiamo spenderli:- 3000 € per arredare le stanze- 3000 € per finire i bagni- 5000 € per installare l’aria condizionata- 7000 € per gli allacciamenti di acqua e luce- 5000 € per i pannelli solari per l’acqua- 1000 € per gli adempimenti burocratici- 1000 € per eventuali imprevistiLa visione del B&B sarà quello di essere fedele alla tradizione istriana per quanto riguarda la cucina e l’ospitalità, ma con una prospettiva di sostenibilità: pannelli solari, politica dell’evitare la stiratura se richiesto, frutta e verdura coltivate in campo a qualche centinaio di metri di distanza, marmellate e pane fatto in casa.Il vostro contributo al progetto sarebbe una benedizione per un’intera famiglia. E, per di più, avrete sempre un posto in questo ambiente accogliente, amichevole e sostenibile.Per ringraziarvi promettiamo molti vantaggi (si veda ""perks"") E se proprio non puoi aiutarci, spargi la voce a tutti i tuoi amici :)",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>2015 Calgary Chamber of Commerce Small Business Award finalist...</div>
<div>Utilizing Traditional values and teachings of our ancestors while combining with modern tools, techniques our team at Wandering Spirit has inspired, empowered thousands of high risk youth, families, schools and communities over the years.  Wandering Spirit has now branched out to the corporate world, providing Aboriginal Awareness training, specialized workshops along with awareness presentations.</div>
<div>My name is Jackie Soppit, I am the owner and Executive Director of Wandering Spirit Native Awareness Ltd.  In short, I would like to express that providing such programs, presentations, performances, classes is my life's work, my passion and love.  I first handedly know the impact not having connection to culture has, in my young life I was disconnected, It wasn't until i was introduced to culture my life turned around.  I can truly say that this way of life saved my life many times over, it is that reason i do what i do.  At the young age of 18 myself and two others created Wandering Spirit as simply a traditional dance class.  Now Wandering Spirit runs programming five days a week - ""Cultural Connections"" and ""Dance Forward"", along with numerous performances, workshops, events, Aboriginal Awareness training, and newly added dance theatre productions. </div>
<h3><br/></h3> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">  - With government funding cut backs we are in need of extra funding to deliver our programming.  At present we have had to make several cut backs with in our programs just to continue.</span><br/></p>
<p>  - With in our program ""Cultural Connections"" participants learn to dance, history of dances, drumming, music break downs, cultural teachings, protocols pertaining to both dance and drumming, life skills, team building, connection with traditionalist, elders, regalia making, public speaking, stage make-up, performance etc.  Once a participant has completed the program and their dance regalia they are recognized by the community in a special ""Rites of Passage"" ceremony held at a large community event (pow wow) open to the public every June. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Wandering Spirit is in need of a space to call their own, at present Wandering Spirit is still run as a home based office renting various dance studios, community halls and spaces to accommodate our programs.  </p>
<p> - materials and supplies</p>
<p>          dance regalia supplies - 12,000 (60 participants to create their own regalia)</p>
<p>          lighting,portable stage and props for dance theatre productions - 15,000</p>
<p>         - list of prices etc</p>
<p>        - $15,000 honorarium for elders/traditionalists/jr. instructor incentives</p>
<p>        - program coordinator salary - $20,000 we have partial funding ($20,000    private sponsor)</p>
<p>   - Full time studio costs $5000/month x 12 = $60,000 - the space would be to house our office, have daily dance training for our dance entertainment team, to deliver our community programming, host events, workshops, training for the public.  </p>
<p>**Funders Perks**</p>
<p>Funders/sponsors are welcomed to come and see the space, take part in classes, events and see schedule of events/performances to attend, they will be publicly acknowledged on our website and on all promotional materials (with their permission).   </p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Your contribution will have an outstanding impact on our company.  Having our own space will allow growth on so many levels; stable facility to host all programming, space for our dance performance group to rehearse performances/productions, Wandering Spirit events, specialized workshops, the ability to transform to a professional dance company having a full time curriculum in all Aboriginal dance styles, in turn empowering a new generation of fully trained dancers/instructors/facilitators which will create new work opportunities as instructors/performers.</p> <ul> <li>In return you as a contributor will have access to our scheduled events/programs/performances.  The opportunity to take part in classes, workshops and come have a site visit while having an authentic experience with in the Aboriginal culture of 2015.</li> <li>Wandering  Spirit is a non-profit company who has provided such programming for 16years now serving well into the 1000's of clients.  We are a grass roots organization fully committed, passionate, hard working and devoted to the success of what we do, inspiring empowering healthy youth, families, communities on outward. </li> <li>In all we do cultural protocol is always followed, either offering, ceremony or consultation with elders. It is these values, traditional teachings we follow that have lead us to our success so far, we take all we do very seriously and handle with the highest respect and care.  </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Being that Wandering Spirit runs out of a home based office we face struggles with space restrictions, office supplies and until we move into our home base office/studio it will continue to be a struggle going from space to space for programming.</p> <ul> <li>Wandering Spirit has run in these conditions for 16 years, its true we have outgrown our space and situation but we have grown from a tiny dance class to servicing 1000's of clients, we will continue until we are blessed with our new space.  </li>

My name is Jackie Soppit, I am the owner and Executive Director of Wandering Spirit Native Awareness Ltd.  In short, I would like to express that providing such programs, presentations, performances, classes is my life's work, my passion and love.  I first handedly know the impact not having connection to culture has, in my young life I was disconnected, It wasn't until i was introduced to culture my life turned around.  I can truly say that this way of life saved my life many times over, it is that reason i do what i do.  At the young age of 18 myself and two others created Wandering Spirit as simply a traditional dance class.  Now Wandering Spirit runs programming five days a week - ""Cultural Connections"" and ""Dance Forward"", along with numerous performances, workshops, events, Aboriginal Awareness training, and newly added dance theatre productions. 
   What We Need & What You Get   - With government funding cut backs we are in need of extra funding to deliver our programming.  At present we have had to make several cut backs with in our programs just to continue.
  - With in our program ""Cultural Connections"" participants learn to dance, history of dances, drumming, music break downs, cultural teachings, protocols pertaining to both dance and drumming, life skills, team building, connection with traditionalist, elders, regalia making, public speaking, stage make-up, performance etc.  Once a participant has completed the program and their dance regalia they are recognized by the community in a special ""Rites of Passage"" ceremony held at a large community event (pow wow) open to the public every June. 

Wandering Spirit is in need of a space to call their own, at present Wandering Spirit is still run as a home based office renting various dance studios, community halls and spaces to accommodate our programs.  
 - materials and supplies
          dance regalia supplies - 12,000 (60 participants to create their own regalia)
          lighting,portable stage and props for dance theatre productions - 15,000
         - list of prices etc
        - $15,000 honorarium for elders/traditionalists/jr. instructor incentives
        - program coordinator salary - $20,000 we have partial funding ($20,000    private sponsor)
   - Full time studio costs $5000/month x 12 = $60,000 - the space would be to house our office, have daily dance training for our dance entertainment team, to deliver our community programming, host events, workshops, training for the public.  
**Funders Perks**
Funders/sponsors are welcomed to come and see the space, take part in classes, events and see schedule of events/performances to attend, they will be publicly acknowledged on our website and on all promotional materials (with their permission).   

    The Impact Your contribution will have an outstanding impact on our company.  Having our own space will allow growth on so many levels; stable facility to host all programming, space for our dance performance group to rehearse performances/productions, Wandering Spirit events, specialized workshops, the ability to transform to a professional dance company having a full time curriculum in all Aboriginal dance styles, in turn empowering a new generation of fully trained dancers/instructors/facilitators which will create new work opportunities as instructors/performers.  In return you as a contributor will have access to our scheduled events/programs/performances.  The opportunity to take part in classes, workshops and come have a site visit while having an authentic experience with in the Aboriginal culture of 2015. Wandering  Spirit is a non-profit company who has provided such programming for 16years now serving well into the 1000's of clients.  We are a grass roots organization fully committed, passionate, hard working and devoted to the success of what we do, inspiring empowering healthy youth, families, communities on outward.  In all we do cultural protocol is always followed, either offering, ceremony or consultation with elders. It is these values, traditional teachings we follow that have lead us to our success so far, we take all we do very seriously and handle with the highest respect and care.      Risks & Challenges Being that Wandering Spirit runs out of a home based office we face struggles with space restrictions, office supplies and until we move into our home base office/studio it will continue to be a struggle going from space to space for programming.  Wandering Spirit has run in these conditions for 16 years, its true we have outgrown our space and situation but we have grown from a tiny dance class to servicing 1000's of clients, we will continue until we are blessed with our new space.  
Another struggle we face is covering costs while waiting for program funding. We have a savings account that will cover us for the next 3 months, by then our funding will be in.    Other Ways You Can Help Wandering Spirit is always in need of volunteers for events/programming etc  your help can help move mountains by helping us get the word out about our company, programs and performances. please share our campaign links with friends, contacts, your help in doing so can make all the difference... thank you for helping us help our community.   And that's all there is to it.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Growing Home</h2>
<h3>A Food Program of HALO, Inc.</h3> <p></p>
<p>We are launching Racine's first urban farm CSA! Let me break that down for you...</p>
<p><strong>Racine</strong> - our downtown area is considered a food desert (in an urban area this means that access to healthy, fresh food is more than a mile away; usually what IS easily accessible is a lot of fast-food, convenient stores, and small corner shops selling little to no produce); we want to be part of the solution to that problem. </p>
<p><strong>First</strong> - before all others in time or order.</p>
<p><strong>Urban</strong> - we are operated by HALO, Inc, an incredible resource addressing homelessness in Racine. Our operation is nestled partly in their parking lot and partly in space owned by our kind neighbor, Kranz, a local distribution company. We're in the city, in the middle of it all. </p>
<p><strong>Farm</strong> - no animals, just amazing, locally-grown vegetables using organic practices!!</p>
<p><strong>CSA</strong> (community supported agriculture) - we are providing this delicious produce to our direct community; the vast majority of our subscribers reside within a two-mile radius of us. These families will receive delivery of fresh vegetables 20 weeks of the year. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>HALO, Inc. was given a grant to raise a hoop house in 2013. With the help of Bukacek construction, the proper zoning from the city of Racine, and the dedicated work of three Americorps VISTA's, that hoop house went up and began producing in 2015. To realize the transformation of our program into a full-scale CSA, we need to construct nearly 20 raised beds and fill them with top-quality, organic soil. Here's a breakdown of these needs:</p>
<p>Lumber for one 8'x4' raised bed = $90<br/>2.5 yards of soil to fill it = $60.</p>
<p>20 of these total = $3,000.00</p>
<p>Soil to fill the hoop house = $700</p>
<p>We also need a top-quality drip irrigation system and cash for the various odds and ends needed to finish off this project (think seeds, shovels, delivery baskets, etc). </p> </div> <div> </div><h3>Will This Matter in Racine?</h3><div> Here's a few things this program will accomplish:</div><div>

<p><b>DOLLARS AND CENTS</b></p>
<p>•<b>New Office/Shop/Kitchen: 25K</b> | We have been looking at a couple of locations capable of handling our office, operational, and storage needs and it is not cheap. Right now we would like to find a convenient office and storage location to optimize efficiency while we find a lease option for our commercial kitchen space and streamline our event and catering needs.</p>
<p>•<b>New Transmission for the HCE Bus: 5K</b> | Currently our bus is functioning safely with no signs of transmission failure. However, I've had the transmission serviced recently and replaced the rear differential. I was informed that it is showing signs of abuse and we would like to replace the transmission prior to the 2016 peak season.</p>
<p>•<b>Additional 14 Passenger Bus: 20K</b> | We have been very busy and it's great, but we are running into transportation conflicts. My partner handles the event planning side of HCE pursuing weddings, corporate retreats and special occasions. We have found it limiting on the business we can accept because of conflicting transportation demands on our recreation and private event side. I have restored a short bus before, and I am willing to do it again if provided the opportunity!</p>
<p>•<b>Marketing and Advertising: 10K</b> | The Achilles heel of business, how to spend your marketing budget and what works? We have spent the past year branding and building a strong social media following and ad campaign. Please visit our social media sites to see what it's like to #BeTheTraveler, don't forget to ""like"" us! I would like to explore other avenues like radio, television and print directed at larger markets to provide exposure for Hood Canal Events and tourism around the Hood Canal.</p>

•Hood Canal Events is a unique event and recreation company that creates customized, personal and authentic PNW experiences for travelers to the region.
•Family run small business on the Hood Canal region of Washington State built on dedication, passion and dreams - oh, and a short bus.
•Kerry established Hood Canal Events in 2012, and I came onboard to assist with the growth of HCE and our event services in the PNW.

WHAT WE OFFER
“Far away the best prize that life has to offer is to work hard at work worth doing"" - Theodore Roosevelt

THE HOOD CANAL REGION
“As soon as I saw you, I knew an adventure was going to happen"" - Winnie the Pooh 


•The Hood Canal Events family is built around the local community, its history, and the legend of the Traveler. 
•The Traveler is a local icon in Union, WA. and his story is described beautifully in an article in the Kitsap Sun, Union Welcomes the Return of “TheTraveler.”  http://www.kitsapsun.com/news/local-news/union-welcomes-return-traveler
•When you #BeTheTraveler, you'll embrace the Hood Canal experience searching for the very best in local art, cuisine, recreation, events and the undeniable beauty of the PNW.
THE BIG ASK


“The only mistake you can make is not asking for help"" - Sandeep Jauhar 




•Our dream is to grow our company, community, Pacific Northwest tourism and our traveler family by providing exposure for this ""hidden gem"" in our upper left corner of the U.S.•Hood
Canal Events has been extremely busy creating unique Pacific Northwest
experiences and we want to increase our capabilities to support our local
community, families and the growing tourism demands for our 2016 season.
•Our
rented cottage office is quaint and unheated - don’t get me wrong, the view is
amazing.
•Our
catering and recreational equipment is currently stored in a rented garage
across the street from our office.
•Our
14-passenger bus has an aging transmission that will need to be replaced soon.
•Any
additional funds received will be utilized for marketing this beautiful area
and the extraordinary event and recreational opportunities it posses for future
travelers – exceptional fishing, hiking, kayaking, festivals and larger events
(5k/10k, etc.).



DOLLARS AND CENTS
•New Office/Shop/Kitchen: 25K | We have been looking at a couple of locations capable of handling our office, operational, and storage needs and it is not cheap. Right now we would like to find a convenient office and storage location to optimize efficiency while we find a lease option for our commercial kitchen space and streamline our event and catering needs.
•New Transmission for the HCE Bus: 5K | Currently our bus is functioning safely with no signs of transmission failure. However, I've had the transmission serviced recently and replaced the rear differential. I was informed that it is showing signs of abuse and we would like to replace the transmission prior to the 2016 peak season.
•Additional 14 Passenger Bus: 20K | We have been very busy and it's great, but we are running into transportation conflicts. My partner handles the event planning side of HCE pursuing weddings, corporate retreats and special occasions. We have found it limiting on the business we can accept because of conflicting transportation demands on our recreation and private event side. I have restored a short bus before, and I am willing to do it again if provided the opportunity!
•Marketing and Advertising: 10K | The Achilles heel of business, how to spend your marketing budget and what works? We have spent the past year branding and building a strong social media following and ad campaign. Please visit our social media sites to see what it's like to #BeTheTraveler, don't forget to ""like"" us! I would like to explore other avenues like radio, television and print directed at larger markets to provide exposure for Hood Canal Events and tourism around the Hood Canal.

</div></div>","Executive Description
Truly honest people in the
Information Technology world, of today, understand and have understood for
quite some time that existing approaches to managing and using data are
woefully inadequate. Senior management, politicians and business owners alike
across all spectrum of Industry, government and research are in agreement, or
as one retired Oil Company executive put it. “50 years of promises, still no straight
answer!” After all, they pay the bills...


The nature of our ""Associative"" Atomic Database technology makes it purpose-built for Big Data, making it possible for organizations to dramatically reduce the effort, time, and investment requirements of any Big Data project. Our platform is a multi-dimensional, multi-data information system, designed from inception to manage relationship complexity to any degree, with no restrictions on the number of associative dimensions or levels persistently. Data security is based on factorial encryption with byte random variability, substantially exceeding RSA encryption standards.. Engineered with usability in mind, AtomicDB is simple to use and easy to understand. This allows AtomicDB to implement projects several orders of magnitude faster than other technologies, ensuring business value and success.One of the potential uses for AtomicDB is as the backbone for Bitcoin, allowing for truly global transaction capability. Another would be as a new Peer to Peer online game development platform. or the ability to correlate and investigate the entirety of medical information in the  USA, and even the globe, with proper design.
Unprecedented Technical Advantages

*    Speeds over 1000+ times faster than SQL row/table queries;
*    No data is too large to gain business insight
*    Data warehousing simplified*    Little or NO ETL *    Unlimited data Aggregation & Correlation (removing the limits of the SQL 15 Join Limits)*   The design capacity to hold PETABYTE  or even EXABYTE + of information using 1/8 the disk space, significantly reducing data storage, hardware and maintenance costs
*    Single instance storage; no piece of data is ever duplicated making ETL (Extract Transform and Load) operations and data cleansing fast, easy, and cost effective
*    Data type agnostic; automated data aggregation across
hundreds of sources becomes a breeze, and seamless
*    No tables or indexing to maintain or understand; App
development time shrinks and complexity is reduced
*    Impenetrable security; with no name-space or storage
structure binding, there is nothing to hack into
*    NO QUERY Language*    6 primitive API CallsAll of this translates to Business Advantages such as :*    50-90% reduction in Storage requirements (costs)*     70-80% reduction in developer costs*     Immediate ROI*     Near elimination of Security concerns (presently 23% of all IT budgets)*     Unprecedented Access to Business Analytics (real time information )*     50% faster to time  market
This is the First quantum leap in Computer Science and Data Management since Dr. Codd in 1971, and his rules of data Normalization. The impact will be global and pervasive for the very simple reason of ""Efficiency""
 The single most powerful word in the world or nature is “Efficiency”, Energy can never be destroyed only transformed. The same applies to information. Despite the best efforts of the best computer scientists in the world with efforts like Hadoop, Mongo, Casandra etc..., they will and are all failing, simply due to the mathematics of the situation... Dr. Codd, created, devised, extrapolated 6 forms of Data NORMALIZATION, and after 45 years (1971), every single Database system or information management system to date has not exceeded the 3rd normal Form... except AtomicDB, (N) Normal Form improving on Dr. Codd's work by 4 levels (dimensions)at the very least .
There was and is a method to his theory, that with each level of Normalization brings a geometric increase in ""Efficiency"" and scalability, however, no one has even attempted the restrictions of the 4th normal form (no duplicates) let alone the 5th or 6th, and now with Dr. Everett’s (N)th Normal Form, we can do anything the human mind can devise on a computer and in nearly real time, that is

 We are nearing the end of phase one, The introduction of AtomicDB to the market, now 3 years in progress.  We have presently invested over 6 million$ into the company, all self fundedThis has been a labor of love and extensive effort from everyone involved and we are seeking equally enthusiastic investors, partners to help bring this benefit to humanity      What We Need  We are seeking funding to dramatically expand marketing and promotion and further develop our resale and partnership channel. This will permit use to hire 4 new sales executives and 4 new support engineers, as well as hold monthly technical conferences for introductory seminars. 
    The Impact
Aside from participating in a game changing technology, with massive humanitarian  & global implications, the excitement of being free to accomplish anything the human mind can imagine using computers is simply intoxicating, to Business, Technical and Academic enterprises alike. 
Every book in the world is still made up of words or phrases or combined symbols. These amount to less than 2 million unique objects, whether some people  like it or not.. Using Associative technology, we can literally now store and make available any and all human knowledge in one place (if desired) and in all languages. The Impact to humanity will be global and pervasive.. Now it's up to you to open your mind..and stop thinking with a 1970's technology  
  Risks & Challenges  The major challenges have been met introducing ""Associative Technology"" to a significant number of clients, this however is insufficient and we have to expand our exposure to more varied and wide ranging clients as well as academic environments Our risks are minimized due to our existing client base    Other Ways You Can Help
For those who want to participate in other ways, we ask you to learn about the technology (programmers, Data Scientists, Data analysts) and consider using it and introducing it to potential clients. We assure you, they will love you for it... .",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>D.C. Imaginaria </h3>
<div>
<p></p>
<p>¿Qué es? </p>
<p>Es un nuevo proyecto que invita a
las personas a vivir una experiencia única desde el momento que entran al local
y consumen nuestras pizzas de altísima calidad, toda una experiencia sensitiva,
que gracias a un chef local podremos crear; nuestro fuerte: El servicio, este
completará la experiencia única que será una mezcla de simplicidad e innovación
en todos los sentidos. El objetivo es hacer sentir a cada persona que entre
importante, por qué? Porque son la base del proyecto social que se esconde bajo
la pizzería. La iniciativa en realidad invita a las personas a realizar una
acción solidaria que tiene su fundamento en la confianza. Consiste en pagar
anticipadamente una comida en este caso una pizza, para que pueda ser entregada
a alguien que no tiene recursos para comprarlo. Esta idea surgió originalmente
en Nápoles, Italia con el nombre de “caffè Sospeso”  y que gracias a las redes sociales ya se ha
extendido por el mundo con muy buena respuesta de la gente, en Colombia se
encuentra Café pendiente Colombia, movimiento del cual somos parte y nos
apoyamos para la primera etapa de este reto.</p>
<p>La segunda etapa consiste en
hacer la entrega de estas pizzas pendientes, en alianza con las diferentes
organizaciones que trabajan con las víctimas de la violencia poder realizar
encuentros semanales para entregar las porciones de pizzas donadas por los
clientes de D.C. Imaginaria, no se trata de una limosna para comer, la persona
que deja una pizza pendiente está brindando la posibilidad de un propósito de
vida a personas que por su situación no tienen esa opción. En resumidas cuentas
D.C. Imaginaria es una plataforma de empoderamiento social. </p>
<p>El cambio comienza con una
porción de pizza… iniciará un viaje que es voluntario, pero que dice “te vamos
a dar un empujón, porque tienes todas las posibilidades de salir adelante” el
objetivo en esta etapa es capacitar a estas personas en habilidades de vida,
emprendimiento y equipamiento laboral, para finalizar con una oferta formal de
trabajo, ya sea en la pizzería o en una organización que aliada. </p>
<p>¿Cómo funciona y en qué consiste?</p>
<p>Imaginaria D.C<b>.</b> tendrá un local independiente en Bogotá
– Colombia, ubicada centralmente donde tanto turistas como bogotanos puedan
acercarse y  vivir una experiencia que
inicie con el aroma de una pizza que bien merece la pena comer; vitrinas con
pizzas, recetas nuevas, simples pero con innovación de sabores y mezclas,
dejando de lado lo tradicional de las pizzas y poder brindar un bocado de
Colombia en cada pizza, si te encanta probar cosas nuevas, estas pizzas tendrás
que probarlas.  </p>
<p>No es una pizzería común. </p>
<p>Detrás de la experiencia gastronómica,
se encuentra el corazón de D.C. Imaginaría, y todo empezará con una sección en
el menú llamada “pizza pendiente” ¿por qué tienen una sección especial del
menú? Porque D.C. Imaginaria cubre un porcentaje del precio de estas, y por
cada cinco pizzas pendientes que nuestros clientes donen D.C. imaginaria pagará
otra pizza pendiente para las personas víctimas del desplazamiento mayores de
edad que viven en Bogotá. </p>
<p>En Colombia el  desplazamiento por la violencia afecta a
miles de colombianos cada año,  de hecho
hoy en día, buena parte de los hogares colombianos afectados viven en
condiciones críticas, que en la mayoría de los casos son peores que las que
caracterizan la indigencia; según estudios realizados para la Misión de la
Pobreza y la Desigualdad de Planeación Nacional la situación de los hogares
víctimas del desplazamiento en los municipios receptores es más precaria que la
que viven en los mismos lugares los pobres urbanos y los hogares indigentes. </p>
<p>Los niveles de desempleo para los
miembros de los hogares desplazados son mucho más altos que los que se tienen
para los miembros de familias pobres urbanas y rurales e indigentes urbanos,
los niveles de cabezas de familia analfabetas es mayor que en otros grupos, es
por esto que decidimos trabajar con ellos no solo para brindarles una porción
de alimento sino para generar una solución que pueda acabar con su ciclo de
pobreza, generando un empleo, dignificando a la persona que salió del campo y
ahora recorre el asfalto sin muchas garantías, brindando herramientas para que
puedan salir adelante. </p>
<p>¿Cómo queremos lograrlo? </p>
<p>Primero es importante aclarar que
D.C. Imaginaria es una organización con fines de lucro, podríamos decir que
está basado en un modelo híbrido de negocio, es decir que genera un cambio
social antes de tener un retorno de inversión, siendo al mismo tiempo lucrativo
y funcional, el plan es llegar al retorno de inversión los primeros seis meses
de funcionamiento, pero que semana a semana el dinero que se genere sea
suficiente para cubrir los gastos operativos. Para esto es indispensable
mantener un producto de calidad y un servicio humano excepcional. </p>
<p>El plan para el programa de
cambio social es crear un programa de sensibilización para la generación de
nuevos empleos que pueda presentarse en organizaciones, fundaciones y empresas
que quieran y puedan hacer parte de este proyecto. En constante seguimiento con
nuestro apoyo para poder capacitar a las personas que estén comprometidos con
dar un cambio a su vida, los vamos a apoyar, a capacitar, a dignificar para que
puedan contar con las herramientas necesarias para su sostenimiento.</p>

<h3>We’re Bernardo and
Andrea, founders of Mezcal Tribal, a company that produces artisanal mezcals. </h3>
<p></p>
<p> We were attracted to mezcal because of the rich
history and tradition of the Mexicans who have made it for hundreds of years.
We thought it was a great fit for our skillset: my wife is a chef and I have
experience in the liquor industry.</p>
<blockquote>We’re passionate
about the flavors and aromas of foods and beverages since they form an
important part of our daily lives. This product allows us to express ourselves
and share our passion with the world.</blockquote> <p></p>
<h2>Our Indiegogo campaign,
an exclusive presale</h2>
<p>We first started working
on this project five years ago, and we’re already selling our mezcal in Mexico.
We tried to enter the US market last year, but we found out that doing so is
extremely difficult for small businesses like ours. As a result, we decided to
create an exceptional new product that could compete with the best and offer
something unique to the market. Fortunately, our efforts were rewarded, and
this year we won the <b>award for best mezcal at the <a href=""https://sfspiritscomp.com/results/overview"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">San Francisco World Spirits Competition</a></b>. We’ve also found a way to enter the US market by using a logistic
services company. However, the first shipment will be very expensive, which is
why we have started this Indiegogo campaign. By preselling our product this unique pre sales Event on
Indiegogo, we’ll be able to raise the funds to get it to the US. </p>
<div><br/></div>
<h2>Why Here?</h2>Mezcal Tribal needs your help in order to take this important next step
in our history. We want you to be able to hold our handmade dream in your
hands. Being able to make our first shipment would give us the opportunity to
enter a new potential market, allowing us to share our passion with millions of
people. </div><div>
<br/><ul> </ul> <p></p>
<h2>What do we need to take
the next step? </h2>
<p>At a minimum, we need to
reach sales of $40,000 in order to cover import and logistics costs, as well as
expenses for the first shipment of Mezcal Tribal. <a href=""http://americanspiritsltd.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">American Spirits Exchange LTD</a> will be our importer.</p>

<p>When
creating a new mezcal, our first step is to find a master mezcalier who
produces the best mezcal. We have tastings of the products of various
mezcaliers, and then choose the best product together. We also ensure that the
mezcal is made using an artisanal process and work carefully to create the
finest product possible.</p>
<p>At this point, we enter the creative part of the process,
when we try several options that combine different types of agave in different
proportions until we’ve found the unique flavor and aroma we’re looking for.
The final step is to label and package the mezcal.</p>

Andrea, founders of Mezcal Tribal, a company that produces artisanal mezcals. 

 We were attracted to mezcal because of the rich
history and tradition of the Mexicans who have made it for hundreds of years.
We thought it was a great fit for our skillset: my wife is a chef and I have
experience in the liquor industry.
We’re passionate
about the flavors and aromas of foods and beverages since they form an
important part of our daily lives. This product allows us to express ourselves
and share our passion with the world. 
Our Indiegogo campaign,
an exclusive presale
We first started working
on this project five years ago, and we’re already selling our mezcal in Mexico.
We tried to enter the US market last year, but we found out that doing so is
extremely difficult for small businesses like ours. As a result, we decided to
create an exceptional new product that could compete with the best and offer
something unique to the market. Fortunately, our efforts were rewarded, and
this year we won the award for best mezcal at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition. We’ve also found a way to enter the US market by using a logistic
services company. However, the first shipment will be very expensive, which is
why we have started this Indiegogo campaign. By preselling our product this unique pre sales Event on
Indiegogo, we’ll be able to raise the funds to get it to the US. 

Why Here?Mezcal Tribal needs your help in order to take this important next step
in our history. We want you to be able to hold our handmade dream in your
hands. Being able to make our first shipment would give us the opportunity to
enter a new potential market, allowing us to share our passion with millions of
people. 
  
What do we need to take
the next step? 
At a minimum, we need to
reach sales of $40,000 in order to cover import and logistics costs, as well as
expenses for the first shipment of Mezcal Tribal. American Spirits Exchange LTD will be our importer.

<p><strong>What Does SpareSource  do ?</strong></p>
<p>There is various kinds of spare resources around our life: your assets,such as the car in garage when you are working; the private parking lot after you drive away; the spare space in your home. These spare resources could be put into use if there is a system which could perfectly match the demand and supplier.For instance,a resident in crowd city would lease his private parking lot when it is empty to someone looking for a nearby parking lot for a couple of hours. A working guy who stays in his office all the day could lease his car to a driver-license holder during working hours if there is a system which supervise the car in remote and make him feel comfortable to lease out. While another guy could probably need a car for an hour if there is a system that could offer him with it in a convenient and efficient way. The most significant obstacle to lease out your spare asset is that how to make your asset under your control when others is using it. SpareSource offer you such system to lease out your assets and to supervise the user. </p>
<p>If you have no spare asset or spare time, but just have spare skills in aspects of sport, technique such as foreign language, math, engineer, programming or fashion,you can also find customers on SpareSource. For instance A yoga girl could sell out her yoga coaching hour in the morning to the guy who is still in bed or someone who want to try a new kind of spot. An enthusiast in fashion and trend could use SpareSource to post her skill to help people find their own fashion style.  </p>
<p>Beyond that, the SpareSource even could do more to make your life more comfortable. Housewives could sell delicacy in their spare time, which could be favored by the hungry single guys. A working parent would find a nanny to give his baby mother-like love in a cozy family environment during the daytime,instead of putting the baby in daycare center where baby hardly get human touch. While a woman with motherhood experience could enjoy and revive the happy hours spending with the little baby in her non-working day if she take care of the baby.  </p>
<p><strong>How Does SpareSource Work?</strong></p>
<p>There are three types of spare resources on SpareSource: private car&amp;parking lot, home &amp; space, service&amp;goods. It is a user-friendly platform(website and APPs).  You can post your private car and parking lot by hour, by day or by week. If you need to use the car or parking lot, you can close the rental business for a while. Similarly,home or space owner could lease out the spare space by day or by week and close the rental business when you occupied it yourself. You can make your business active again whenever the spare resources are in status of idle. In the service&amp;goods sector, you can post your home-made food, in-home tutor, technique service or personal fashion collections ect, whenever you have spare time. SpareSource offer you a business management system, which you can deal with your orders, communicate with clients and check the status of your spare resource when others is using it.

<h3> </h3>
<p>I am Jonathan Moloney, otherwise nicknamed CaveTroll for being enormous and ugly (My little joke that). I started out as a cost engineer but a few years ago was retrenched. Since then finding work has become nigh on impossible in my country. However, rather than sit around and hope for the best I decided to take the future into my own hands and start an archery and woodworking business from home. That was four and a half years ago...</p>
<p>My decision to start this campaign is that while I have enjoyed some small success so far and my name is becoming known, it has become quite urgent to build up a fully functional workshop. At the moment every cent earned goes straight back into the business to try to keep it stocked with wood, tools and consumables so it has yet to put food on the table and help support my family. I love my work. In fact I cannot think of anything else I would rather do. Indeed, I am passionate about producing high quality heirloom level items from bows and arrows through to furniture and the like. </p>
<p>With your help I will be able to turn this into a viable business that can sustain my family and I and make my clients happier in the future as well. At present the workshop is a hastily put together workbench under a gazebo at my families home. With this campaign I will be able to build a small yet fully stocked and functional workshop capable of producing just about anything in wood and thus fulfill both my dream and help look after the people I love.</p>
<p>I need $35 000 (In South African rand that equates to  around R480 000) for this campaign to work perfectly. While that may seem like rather a lot each and every cent is budgeted, from building the workshop space and all the materials to the tools themselves and materials down to the last screw and dab of glue. There is even a contingency for exchange fluctuations and any tools not in stock here that have to be ordered from overseas. Any contributor is more than welcome to contact me for a full cost breakdown and each and every purchase will be accounted for. Absolute honesty and transparency is the order of the day.</p>
<p>Even if the total is not reached I can still build the workshop itself or even get a few of the needed tools to progress further in realizing this dream!</p>
<p>And yes there will indeed be perks! Everything from the contributors names being prominently displayed at the workshop and events right through to engraved wooden tankards, arrow sets and even my specialty Holmegaard bow custom made for the generous contributors! All of which will be shown via my upcoming YouTube channel as well!</p>
<p>Whilst I cannot say it will be particularly valuable to the contributor apart from the perks mentioned I can categorically state that your contributions will help keep the wolves from the door and not only help save a small business but help to push it to the next level of production. You can help me become a valuable and contributing member of society that works within my passion as well as help me gain the means and ability to support my family. There is not enough gratitude in the wold that I could give for such an opportunity!</p>
<p>Success so far has been small but it is there. My name as a quality producer of bows and someone with an excellent level of customer care is growing slowly but surely. Every client so far has been exceedingly happy with their bows and other projects done for them. This campaign will enable further and more stable growth in that regard!</p>
</div><div>
<p>Finally, there are always risks and challenges associated with any undertaking. As an ex cost engineer though all possible contingencies are planned for or at least guarded against. For example, if the South African market slows it does not mean failure as with this will be the addition of a website and etsy shop to serve the rest of the world for any item they would like. I would like this to become a global name with an exceptional service record.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In closing I would like to thank everyone deeply in advance for any and all help! And even if you can't contribute financially, you are still more than welcome to share this campaign everywhere you can via Indiegogo's sharing tools!!</p>

<h3>Hi!</h3>
<p>My name is Heather and I have spent over twenty-five years in childcare.  I have assisted, taught, and directed both large and small schools.  Over the past year or so I have worked at night at UPS, doing something completely different was hard, exciting, exhausting, rejuvenating, and eye-opening. </p>
<p>Now I've decided to open a family daycare which all my education and experience has prepared me for and working all night has shown me how many people are taking jobs late night/early morning to make ends meet and how much help they can use.</p>
<p>Contributing to my campaign will help me with start up costs so that I will be better ready to service those people who work hard at all hours of the day and night.</p>
<p>A little more about me:  I'm a single foster mom, I'm a Christian, I've lived my whole life in Southern California, and I love tacos. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>some of the places your money will go:</p>
<ul>
<li>shade for backyard</li>
<li>emergency crib(s)</li>
<li>refurbished iPad</li>
<li>outdoor child-sized table</li>
<li>indoor child-sized table</li>
<li>supplies (office, craft, cleaning, etc)</li>
<li>childcare management software</li>
<li>printer/scanner</li>

<h3>What You Get</h3>

<li>paver with your name or handprint or message painted on it</li>
<li>Backer tee</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Your contribution will have a real world immediate effect on the early success of my business!  Even if I don't reach my full goal, I should be able to purchase several of the necessary items and be ready to open in the first quarter of 2018</li>
<li>Having run successful preschools, I know what items are necessary for immediate use and those which can wait a bit for later, I'm ready to get started asap!</li>
<li>As this campaign is running I'm doing the paperwork and home inspections to become licensed through the county to run a legal family child care in California. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>One of the biggest challenges for any new business is customers.  I have a lot of experience and education, but I moved my family about a year and a half ago so we could have a bigger place and I don't know very many people in my new neighborhood.  It may take time to build trust and a good reputation in the community.</li>
<li>My plan for overcoming this is recommendations and reviews.  I have several parents I've asked to write references for me and I will provide those to potential clients.  I am also thinking of using Yelp and other social media.</li>

We aim to break away from the traditional guided tours and provide you with a personalized experience to give you a true taste of what Miami has to offer.  Learn how to make a signature cocktail with a mixologist, shop until you drop with a personal stylist at some of Miami's best shops, enjoy staple Miami cuisine, dance the night away at some of Miami's best clubs; experience Miami in a new way!</p>

From there, you'll complete our customization form so that you can truly make this experience your own.   Soak up the sun on a boat, get a five star massage by the beach, have a mixologist or chef come to you to teach a class, go on a walking tour to learn the culture and history of Miami while sampling culinary staples...you hold the key!</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560480566/px9baevxldcrljcammuo.png"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

Starting a business is no easy feat, especially in an industry that doesn't have a strong minority presence.  By contributing to the cause, you'll be able to receive your own Key2MIA experience, swag and more.  There are perks for each price point and a few of the faves are highlighted below. </p>
<p>The goal is $10,000 and the money will go towards:</p>

<p>With your contribution, you will allow more tourists to experience Miami like a local.  Last year, over 16 million people visited Miami.  Most people usually frequent our beautiful beaches, energetic nightclubs and our captivating casinos, but have no knowledge of all the jewels that await them in Miami.  With your contribution, you provide an option for these tourists to take the path less traveled and experience some of Miami's breathtaking architecture, culinary delights,  and the many diverse neighborhoods that make Miami so unique.  You are helping to make sure we have the right representation and how others are introduced to our neighborhoods.</p>
<p>You'll also allow tourists (and locals) to get a personal experience and truly see Miami through the eyes of a local.  Key2MIA local ambassadors LOVE where they live and can provide so much information about the city that they would never learn on their own.  Tours and experiences are also very intimate.  If a person books for them and a few friends, no one else is booked during that time.  No need to feel limited by the schedule of big tour groups.  Enjoy Miami at your own pace and ask questions; truly get to know Miami and your tour guide. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Like any small business, there are some risks and challenges.  However, with your help, I know that Key2MIA can be a huge success.  Here's why:</p>
<ul><li>Miami is a major tourist location and there are several other tour services in the city as a result.  Where Key2MIA stands out is that we will not only provide tours, but we will customize your entire stay in Miami if needed.  We also provide each client with the Key to the City and a custom playlist, promoting local businesses and giving you a little piece of Miami to take home with you. </li></ul>

<li>Where should I stay?</li>
<li>What are your recommendations on places to eat?</li>
<li>What things are there to do in Miami?</li>
</ul><p>My mom had ignited the spark in me to start a business and answer these questions for many others visiting Miami. Being that I was once a novice in the city, I immersed myself into learning more about the 305 and fell in love with it.  Those things coupled with my passion for learning about other cultures and walks of life, made this new career path the perfect route for me to begin the new year.   I wanted to change the views that tourists have about Miami.  My mission is to allow tourists to think beyond the beach while also bringing diversity to how tourists can reach our communities.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560479711/rcmxrk5qxefkvkhqbfj8.png"" src=""""/></p></div>","Who is Key2MIA?

From there, you'll complete our customization form so that you can truly make this experience your own.   Soak up the sun on a boat, get a five star massage by the beach, have a mixologist or chef come to you to teach a class, go on a walking tour to learn the culture and history of Miami while sampling culinary staples...you hold the key!

What We Need & What You Get
Let me start out by thanking you in advance for your support! Starting a business is no easy feat, especially in an industry that doesn't have a strong minority presence.  By contributing to the cause, you'll be able to receive your own Key2MIA experience, swag and more.  There are perks for each price point and a few of the faves are highlighted below. 
The goal is $10,000 and the money will go towards:

Startup funds for tourism certification renewals/annual fees, membership with tourism bureau to expand my reach, vehicle rentals for experiences, etc. 
Salary for 2 month period
Marketing and addition to website for streamlining our booking process

In return, you get 
$20: Key to the City                                                                
     
 $40: Sponsor A Playlist            

$60: Key2MIA Swag


With your contribution, you will allow more tourists to experience Miami like a local.  Last year, over 16 million people visited Miami.  Most people usually frequent our beautiful beaches, energetic nightclubs and our captivating casinos, but have no knowledge of all the jewels that await them in Miami.  With your contribution, you provide an option for these tourists to take the path less traveled and experience some of Miami's breathtaking architecture, culinary delights,  and the many diverse neighborhoods that make Miami so unique.  You are helping to make sure we have the right representation and how others are introduced to our neighborhoods.
You'll also allow tourists (and locals) to get a personal experience and truly see Miami through the eyes of a local.  Key2MIA local ambassadors LOVE where they live and can provide so much information about the city that they would never learn on their own.  Tours and experiences are also very intimate.  If a person books for them and a few friends, no one else is booked during that time.  No need to feel limited by the schedule of big tour groups.  Enjoy Miami at your own pace and ask questions; truly get to know Miami and your tour guide. 

Risks & Challenges
Like any small business, there are some risks and challenges.  However, with your help, I know that Key2MIA can be a huge success.  Here's why:
Miami is a major tourist location and there are several other tour services in the city as a result.  Where Key2MIA stands out is that we will not only provide tours, but we will customize your entire stay in Miami if needed.  We also provide each client with the Key to the City and a custom playlist, promoting local businesses and giving you a little piece of Miami to take home with you. 


Some people just can't contribute and that's understandable, but that doesn't mean you can't help:

Word of mouth: tell others about this campaign. 
Sharing is caring: a simple repost, retweet or forward helps us just as much because it gets the word out about Key2MIA!  You can also use the Indiegogo share tools. 
Follow:  Find Key2MIA on Facebook and Instagram...we promise to follow back :)

Thank you for your support!  In the words of Mr. 305 himself, ¡dale!
 ABOUT THE KEY-EOHello!My name is Keymia and I am the curator of your ultimate destination management company, Key2MIA.I spent most of my career in sales and eventually tried my hand in the world of advertising.  I never saw myself in the tourism industry, but I always like to say that life led me in this direction.  At the end of 2018, I lost the love of my life and, shortly after, my job.  With an eight year old dependent upon me and no light at the end of the tunnel, I felt defeated and frustrated.  A few days after taking those substantial blows, I had a conversation with my mother who was seeking recommendations for family that was visiting Miami in the next few months.  I noticed that she, like all others that would visit, asked the same three questions:
Where should I stay?
What are your recommendations on places to eat?
What things are there to do in Miami?
My mom had ignited the spark in me to start a business and answer these questions for many others visiting Miami. Being that I was once a novice in the city, I immersed myself into learning more about the 305 and fell in love with it.  Those things coupled with my passion for learning about other cultures and walks of life, made this new career path the perfect route for me to begin the new year.   I wanted to change the views that tourists have about Miami.  My mission is to allow tourists to think beyond the beach while also bringing diversity to how tourists can reach our communities.",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>So, we need a little “play” money, not Monopoly money (we have that at PDC).  Keeping children happy is costly, not to mention New York real estate, contractors, indoor playground equipment, pounds of crayons, glitter glue, and more.   We need an additional $275,000 to support the cost of equipment and furnishing necessary to quickly get the space up and running as fast as possible.

I feel like I was that way and a lot of my friends were that way until we gave it a try.

Whether it's your first time trying meat-alternative foods or you're a certified vegan, Rip's is the destination for delicious, American-style comfort food.  ""We have customers that come in who don’t even realize that the food we are selling has no meat in it, and they leave just as happy as anybody else."" One of our top selling items at Rip’s Malt Shop (pictured above) is our “Chopped Cheese,” which is a NYC bodega staple. Being natives, we just had to include it on the menu.  The chopped cheese is a burger all chopped up, as the name suggests, with relish and onions added to it as it’s cooking on the griddle and topped with shredded cheddar cheese. Then we put all that on a hearty, club roll with lettuce, tomato and secret sauce.   Our other best-selling item is the Rip's burger, made with coleslaw, BeyondMeat burger patties, rice-paper bacon (which we make in-house), red-bean & quinoa chili, and our very special Rip’s Sauce - an in-house, vegan version of “secret sauce”.  All of our sundaes and milkshakes are made with Van Leeuwen’s vegan ice cream products, another Brooklyn-based company with a conscious mission in mind.It's the personal opinion of one our owners, Dave - life long ice cream connoisseur and professional chef -  that the vegan ice cream makes even better milkshakes than regular ice cream does. So Yeah - you’re welcome for that RipTip! Veganism is about more than just food,and this campaign is about more than just opening another vegan restaurant.  Hear our stories why... Erick’s RIP's StoryRip’s is a great restaurant because it's a nice stepping stone for people trying to make a change to veganism. It’s really easy to understand our menu – you know what a burger is, what a hot dog is, and you know what a milk shake is. And yes - you can still enjoy all of those things as a vegan.Rip’s wants people to still enjoy eating whatever they want. Eating healthy is the way to go, but sometimes you do want a burger and you do want a hot dog - at Rip’s we have that awesome comfort food you want, and you don’t have to hurt your body or the planet to enjoy it.People come here and stay for hours. They’ll eat one burger and hang out for 2 or 3 hours just talking with other customers. It’s cool how people can share ideas here. There are so many times I’ve started conversations with someone and then someone across the room chimes in, and the delivery guy comes in and says “I’ve been coming here for weeks and didn’t even realize it was vegan!” and that starts a whole other conversation!  Everyone's open to each others ideas here, it's what makes this place so special. Veganism is more than just food. To show people what I meant by that I started an Instagram @HowToBeVeganInTheHood. A lot of my friends didn’t understand veganism, and they were always wondering “like, what do you eat as a vegan?” There are so many times I heard “So what?You only eat salad?  You eat dirt? What do you eat?"" So I honestly just wanted to show them that I wasn’t missing out on anything. I was still getting the same flavors that I wanted and I didn't have to hurt animals or the environment in the process. Being Puerto Rican, it’s part of the Heritage to eat pork and all this other stuff, and for a while I was like “I’m never going to stop. I can’t.” But I’ve come to learn that being closed minded about anything in life isn’t going to get you very far. I feel like I was that way and a lot of my friends were that way until we gave it a try. Now, to this day, I tell people, “even if you’re telling yourself you don’t want to go vegan - ever – give it a try for just a week out of your life and see how you feel."" You may like it, you may not, the choice is yours, but give it a chance and then see what happens from there. Dave’s RIP's Story Before I owned Rip’s Malt Shop, I owned a barbecue restaurant if you can believe that.  However, the more research I did on growing my meat-based business, the more I found instead of the appalling impacts red meat and meat production on our bodies and our environment. It became too hard to stomach the facts. As a young, restaurant owner I knew I had to step up and do my part now to end the cycle of using products that generate profit at the expense of people and the environment.  Look, I'm not saying that making this kind of conscious commitment is easy.  I used to be the biggest meat-eater ever.  I'm not proud to admit it, but I even tried denying all this for a while because, like most other people in NYC, I grew up having meat in almost every single one of my daily meals my entire life.  Now I never could have imagined that I would ""take"" to plant-based foods myself, but I also knew in some way I had to at least try, if not for myself, then for the people I serve.Interestingly enough, in the process of searching for plant-based alternatives to serve at my restaurants I ended up learning how easy it was to eat plant-based myself while still getting all the flavors I love.  It's been an enlightening process so far, and dare I say it, I just might be on my way to becoming fully plant-based myself.That's right - spoiler alert - not all of us who own Rip’s are vegan. (It's probably why we aren’t your typical snobs about it too!) Our team of diverse, industry veterans is committed to supporting conscious food practices, eating locally, and serving plant-based foods whenever possible.At Rip's we acknowledge that veganism is a conscious process. It's not something that can be flipped on and off like a switch. It takes an effort to change our minds and accept the work we each need to do to ensure a sustainable future we can all benefit from.  That’s really the ""meat"" of what Rip’s is about and why we started this concept. Whether you’re a vegan or not, everyone can come and enjoy the comfort-food at Rip’s Malt Shop.  What We Are Looking For... We want to rip up everything you thought you knew about veganism and bring the best, vegan dining experience to lower Manhattan that everyone - from the certified vegans, to the plant-based curious, to the true-blooded meat-eaters - can enjoy.  Rip's is looking to raise $35,000—with a stretch goal of $80,000— to help us expand our vegan restaurant concept to Lower Manhattan. With your support we can achieve our mission to build a competitive, restaurant business based on ecologically sustainable and socially-forward practices. Help us show more people that there is a better way to eat comfort-food that's both better for you and for our planet.   Every dollar of your support will be put right back into developing and expanding the Rip's Malt Shop restaurants.  From buildout, to equipment, to licensing logistics and operations - your donations will help us grow and become a leader of the plant-based movement toward a sustainable future for our people and our planet.   With Your Help... We can spread the plant-based food phenomenon to help lessen the human impact on the environment, slow down the detrimental meat industry in America, and bring vegan food to neighborhoods lacking in decent meat-alternative options. At Rip's we believe in conscious eating and we are committed to serving people the food they love without harming the planet. Lettuce prove it to you - one burger at a time.   Our seeds for a plant-based movement have been sown, and we are passionate in showing how Rip's Malt Shop can grow to its utmost potential.   Rip's is committed to making food that's both good for you and for the planet. We want to share our vegan concept with a larger community and with your support, open a 2nd location in Lower Manhattan. Help us spread the word & share our campaign!          #RipsItUp    #Buckforourluck     Video created & produced by The Humane League",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Hi! I'm Amy, and I run a bakery called Peaches Bakeshop. I'm fundraising to create a brick &amp; mortar location for making and offering my vegan baked goods!</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579568605/pn93nhyoe9m41jcstiuw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I formed Peaches in April of 2018, but I’ve been baking for over 10 years. My love for baking sparked when I went vegan in 2009. Vegan baked goods weren’t accessible to me where I lived in New Jersey, so I started baking for myself. The first thing I ever baked was vegan snickerdoodle cookies. Once I bit into that cookie, it was like my world opened up, and I began to wonder what other baked goods I could veganize. I graduated with a Pastry Arts Certificate in 2011, and that’s when my career really started. I worked in bakeries in New Jersey until my husband and I moved to California in the fall of 2013. Since then, I’ve been working in kitchens and baking freelance, and I am finally ready for a space of my own. </p>
<p>Not only will your contribution help me to secure a storefront, fill the space with all of the necessary equipment, and get me started, it will enable me to live out my dream - providing Los Angeles with handcrafted baked goods made with love - something that I believe that the city is still in need of. My specialty is cakes, but I make everything from cakes to croissants to pies and more.</p>
<p>I don't have a location secured yet, but the aim is to be located in Northeast LA.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>I am seeking $50,000, which will aid in securing the lease of a building, equipment (including mixers, double convection oven, bakery cases, commercial fridge &amp; freezer, retail POS system), working capital in the beginning stages of opening the Peaches storefront, and permits &amp; licensing.</li>
<li>My perks include coffee, pastries, merch, cake, and even a cake decorating class for you and a friend!</li>
<li>If I don't reach my entire goal, I'm still going to push hard to keep Peaches Bakeshop going. Funds raised will be used to secure the lease of a space, and if necessary, I will seek a small business loan. Of course, I'd rather operate with the support of my community rather than be at the mercy of a bank, but the Peaches brick &amp; mortar is on the horizon either way!</li>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>More vegan options for the community! Making vegan baked goods more readily accessible in Los Angeles is, in my opinion, deeply necessary! Even in 2020, it is a scarcity to walk into a bakery and order a delicious and beautiful vegan birthday cake.</li>
<li>The vegan community is growing every year, with new vegan options popping up all of the time. The demand for vegan food is on the rise.</li>
<li>Peaches Bakeshop as it exists now, although small, with just me at the helm, and only operating in my spare time, has been a success! I am asked often where I can be found, and I can't wait to be able to point folks in the direction of a physical brick &amp; mortar!</li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Owning a small business always comes with risk. Price fluctuation in food depending on the season is among one of them. I can avoid this risk by negotiating contracts with wholesalers at fixed pricing. </li>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p>Dear Upper Valley residents; Dartmouth students, faculty, alumni, and staff; and maybe even a few generous book lovers from all around the world,</p>
<p>My name is Allie Levy and I am here to bring Still North Books &amp; Bar to Hanover, NH. </p>
<h3>A bookstore/bar!? Tell me more.</h3>
<p>Yes! <strong>Still North Books &amp; Bar </strong>will occupy 2,678 square foot on the first floor of the former Dartmouth Bookstore, with the main entrance on Allen Street. The inventory will be curated specifically for the community, with a focus on literary fiction, narrative nonfiction, indie presses, local and alumni authors, book club picks, poetry, outdoor reference and guides, cookbooks, and theory. Want a book that’s not on our shelves? Just ask. We will have access to nearly any book currently in print and be able to get it in for you in just a few business days.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549550177/z95vkfvssrdrhgak0jda.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>When I heard that the Dartmouth Bookstore would be closing at the end of 2018, I was heartbroken at first to see a nearly 150-year old institution shutter its doors. But the more I thought about the possibility of bringing a bookstore to a town we love, I got excited. I think we need a new bookstore in Hanover, and it turns out, <a href=""https://www.vnews.com/Column-A-Wish-List-for-the-Upper-Valley-for-the-New-Year-22482818"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">a</a> <a href=""https://www.vnews.com/Over-Easy-Dan-Mackie-regrets-the-impending-closing-of-the-Dartmouth-Bookstore-20980903"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">lot</a> <a href=""https://www.vnews.com/Dartmouth-Bookstore-Closes-Who-to-Blame-22392788"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">of</a> <a href=""https://dailyuv.com/972050"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">you</a> <a href=""http://www.thedartmouth.com/article/2018/09/the-dartmouth-bookstore-to-close-lease-not-renewed"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">agree</a>. After months of lease negotiations, I am ecstatic to have secured a portion of the former Dartmouth Bookstore space, which I will be turning into the bookstore (plus bar and cafe!) that Hanover deserves. <strong>While my personal funding and loans will cover what I need for build-out, fixtures, professional services, and operating expenses, I’m asking for your help in filling the shelves with books.</strong></p>
<p>Hanover doesn’t deserve just any bookstore. We deserve a bookstore overflowing with the books that we want to read in a gathering space with cozy chairs and perfect work nooks and beverages for any time of day and delicious food from fresh ingredients. We deserve a bookstore that’s going to last. Yes, it can be a tough world for bookstores, which rely on low-margin products that require a lot of physical space to make a profit. Supplementary revenue from the bar and café will help.</p>
<p>For this reason, Still North Books &amp; Bar will serve wine, craft beer, and locally roasted coffee to keep your thirst quenched and your energy up while you devour your book or get in the zone with some work. We don’t just want you to buy your books here; we want you to stay and enjoy them, maybe even make a friend or find some community, and the physical space will reflect that. We look forward to welcoming you for our community events, including readings, signings, book clubs, story times, trivia and game nights, and more when we open for business in fall 2019.</p>
<p>If you want to watch us as we grow, follow us on Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook for renovation pictures, promotions, event teasers, special guest star testimonials from some of your favorite authors, and of course, the opening day announcement. </p>
<h3>And all this is going to cost HOW MUCH?</h3>
<p>My total start up budget is $350,000. That includes extensive renovations (many of which will be covered by my landlord), bar build-out, book fixtures and other furniture, licensing, legal fees, graphic design, signage, other professional services, labor, tech, a point of sale system, coffee equipment, refrigeration, miscellaneous bar equipment, and, of course, books.</p>
<p><strong>$75,000 will cover roughly 75% of our opening inventory.</strong> Every dollar over our goal up to $100,000 means more books on the shelves! And any amount over $100,000 will go towards making the store an even better place for you to hang out—more comfy chairs, better reading nooks, more programming… I need your help to make Still North Books &amp; Bar the bookstore that Hanover deserves.</p>
<h3>What's in it for me?</h3>
<p><strong>When you contribute, you're actively investing in the future of your community. </strong>For added motivation, we're offering some great incentives, including signed books, tote bags, free coffee, bookmarks, discounts, early access to news about the bookstore, and more. If you have ever longed for a new kind of space in Hanover, here is your chance to help make one.</p>

<h3>Okay, but who are you?</h3>

<p>I graduated from Dartmouth in 2011 with a degree in English. Since 2005, I have worked for and managed both small businesses and regional chains, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>a Birkenstock store in Northern Michigan where I learned that even if the shoe fits, what matters most is making happy customers;</li>
<li>the Eastern Mountain Sports flagship in NYC where I realized that even if you try, you can’t turn Manhattan into an outdoor playground on par with the Upper Valley;</li>
<li>an ice cream shop in Golden, Colo., where I was reminded day after day that while Amazon can ship ice cream, they can’t ship an experience;</li>
<li>and the <a href=""http://bookbardenver.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">most perfect bookstore/wine bar</a> you could possibly imagine in Denver, which is the primary inspiration for this project.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interspersed with my retail experience is four years of marketing experience in the book publishing and outdoor industries, with a focus on social media, content marketing, and event coordinating. My career has taken me from New York City to Denver, and back to New York, and after years of city dwelling, I could not be more thrilled to return to Hanover!</p>
<p>What you really need to know is that I have dreamed of opening a proper bookstore in Hanover for years. The Upper Valley felt like home from the minute I stepped foot on the Dartmouth campus as a visiting high schooler. While my experience in publishing, marketing, and bookselling will be a huge asset, what’s really going to get the doors open (and keep them open) is my love for this place and the people that live here—and my conviction that <strong>bookstores are crucial to the health of their communities.</strong></p>
</div><h3>Seems like risky business… Why indies?</h3><p>Between 2009 and 2015, the number of independent bookstores in the U.S. increased by 35%. E-book sales are down this year while physical book sales continue to climb, particularly in the independent channel. Sales at indies showed a 5.4% compound growth rate over the past five years, and a nearly 5% increase for 2018 over 2017 as of mid-December. At the same time, sales at big-box book stores are down.</p><p>You may have seen this on your social media feeds recently:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549547941/fq8leidbw5gczkhdxkkd.png"" src=""""/></p><p>But you’re a reader, not a statistician, so here’s the crux of the matter: <strong>independent bookstores provide a third place for people to gather away from work or home and revel in their community</strong>, exchange ideas with their neighbors, get lost in someone else’s experience, or simply take some time alone—together.</p><h3>How else can I support Still North Books &amp; Bar?</h3><p>If you’re not in a position to give, here are a few other ideas:</p><ul>
<li>Share this page on your social media</li>

After months of lease negotiations, I am ecstatic to have secured a portion of the former Dartmouth Bookstore space, which I will be turning into the bookstore (plus bar and cafe!) that Hanover deserves. While my personal funding and loans will cover what I need for build-out, fixtures, professional services, and operating expenses, I’m asking for your help in filling the shelves with books.
Hanover doesn’t deserve just any bookstore. We deserve a bookstore overflowing with the books that we want to read in a gathering space with cozy chairs and perfect work nooks and beverages for any time of day and delicious food from fresh ingredients. We deserve a bookstore that’s going to last. Yes, it can be a tough world for bookstores, which rely on low-margin products that require a lot of physical space to make a profit. Supplementary revenue from the bar and café will help.
For this reason, Still North Books & Bar will serve wine, craft beer, and locally roasted coffee to keep your thirst quenched and your energy up while you devour your book or get in the zone with some work. We don’t just want you to buy your books here; we want you to stay and enjoy them, maybe even make a friend or find some community, and the physical space will reflect that. We look forward to welcoming you for our community events, including readings, signings, book clubs, story times, trivia and game nights, and more when we open for business in fall 2019.
If you want to watch us as we grow, follow us on Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook for renovation pictures, promotions, event teasers, special guest star testimonials from some of your favorite authors, and of course, the opening day announcement. 
And all this is going to cost HOW MUCH?
My total start up budget is $350,000. That includes extensive renovations (many of which will be covered by my landlord), bar build-out, book fixtures and other furniture, licensing, legal fees, graphic design, signage, other professional services, labor, tech, a point of sale system, coffee equipment, refrigeration, miscellaneous bar equipment, and, of course, books.
$75,000 will cover roughly 75% of our opening inventory. Every dollar over our goal up to $100,000 means more books on the shelves! And any amount over $100,000 will go towards making the store an even better place for you to hang out—more comfy chairs, better reading nooks, more programming… I need your help to make Still North Books & Bar the bookstore that Hanover deserves.
What's in it for me?
When you contribute, you're actively investing in the future of your community. For added motivation, we're offering some great incentives, including signed books, tote bags, free coffee, bookmarks, discounts, early access to news about the bookstore, and more. If you have ever longed for a new kind of space in Hanover, here is your chance to help make one.

Okay, but who are you?

I graduated from Dartmouth in 2011 with a degree in English. Since 2005, I have worked for and managed both small businesses and regional chains, including:

a Birkenstock store in Northern Michigan where I learned that even if the shoe fits, what matters most is making happy customers;
the Eastern Mountain Sports flagship in NYC where I realized that even if you try, you can’t turn Manhattan into an outdoor playground on par with the Upper Valley;
an ice cream shop in Golden, Colo., where I was reminded day after day that while Amazon can ship ice cream, they can’t ship an experience;
and the most perfect bookstore/wine bar you could possibly imagine in Denver, which is the primary inspiration for this project.

Interspersed with my retail experience is four years of marketing experience in the book publishing and outdoor industries, with a focus on social media, content marketing, and event coordinating. My career has taken me from New York City to Denver, and back to New York, and after years of city dwelling, I could not be more thrilled to return to Hanover!
What you really need to know is that I have dreamed of opening a proper bookstore in Hanover for years. The Upper Valley felt like home from the minute I stepped foot on the Dartmouth campus as a visiting high schooler. While my experience in publishing, marketing, and bookselling will be a huge asset, what’s really going to get the doors open (and keep them open) is my love for this place and the people that live here—and my conviction that bookstores are crucial to the health of their communities.
Seems like risky business… Why indies?Between 2009 and 2015, the number of independent bookstores in the U.S. increased by 35%. E-book sales are down this year while physical book sales continue to climb, particularly in the independent channel. Sales at indies showed a 5.4% compound growth rate over the past five years, and a nearly 5% increase for 2018 over 2017 as of mid-December. At the same time, sales at big-box book stores are down.You may have seen this on your social media feeds recently:But you’re a reader, not a statistician, so here’s the crux of the matter: independent bookstores provide a third place for people to gather away from work or home and revel in their community, exchange ideas with their neighbors, get lost in someone else’s experience, or simply take some time alone—together.How else can I support Still North Books & Bar?If you’re not in a position to give, here are a few other ideas:
Share this page on your social media

<p>The dry season is soon upon us, the rain water reservoir t<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">ank  is currently at 34 cm which is about 12,000 liters, but we need to seal it properly in order to use the full capacity of 46,500 liter!  We still need help.</span></p>
<p>Sam has chosen lovely perks, ranging from insider knowledge on growing your own hydroponic strawberries to oyster mushroom sporeprints (with instructions on how to grow them) to a variety of beautiful African handicraft.</p>
<p>If you visit <b>Kololo</b> in Kampala, drop into<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/thebistrokampala?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> The Bistro</a> where they use Sam's Hydroponic Strawberries in a popular cocktail with rum and crushed ice. Sam has dubbed the drink ""Dessert Yum Yum"". His berries can also be bought at a Chinese owned Italian supermarket and an Indian grocer- in Tank hill and Kisimenti.</p>
<p>If you're too far away from Kampala,  you can take some <b>video tours</b> of the farm with Sam: check out the ingredients required to produce lovely strawberries and have a look at all the wonderful wildlife in the area. There are new updates in the video gallery!</p><p></p><p>Keep in mind that you are helping someone who is helping themselves in ""The Pearl of Africa"".

<p>Sam's Hydroponic strawberries are grown on the family farm which is located in the lakeshore zone outside of Kampala, Uganda where I live and work. Agriculture is the backbone of Uganda's economy and the rich, red earth and favorable climate conditions are a blessing. Aside from Strawberries I have used my entrepreneurial and engineering skills to be a self-taught farmer in fish, mushrooms and various fruit seedlings for local farmers. Being my own boss is exhilarating as well as a challenge and I am learning everyday.</p>
<p>My farm relies on a 46,500 liter underground rainwater reservoir for most of our water needs.</p>
<p>In order to be economically viable we must use the free rain water, and store it in anticipation of the dry season. There is also a government water utility company, but, to cut down on costs and ensure that our small business can keep in business, we limit the use of expensive government water.</p>
<p>Hydroponic strawberries have many benefits and are easy to grow: the berries are plump and luscious and easier on your back to harvest. There is a good market for the sweet strawberries- full of vitamins and minerals. I started construction of the system and planting of the strawberries last year.</p>
<p>As I got ready to start my business, I did not realize that my underground rainwater reservoir was leaking!  Primarily, it was a slow leak. The full tank leaked out in 3-4 weeks and by the time that I noticed, my construction budget had also leaked dry.</p>
<p>I messed up.  And now, I need some help.</p>
<p>Today, the leak is worse, and in the film you can see how plant roots are growing and increasing the cracks. Along with hairline cracks in the walls and sides this means that the tank can now only hold 34 cm of water. That is approx. 3 days supply in the Dry season!</p>
<p>Last January to March was an unusually hot Dry season and it was a real challenge to keep my plants alive while they consumed 1000 liters of water per day. Unfortunately, there was not a drop of rain and the government water utility started rationing water. This meant that water was only supplied Saturday, Tuesday and Thursday from 12am to 5am.</p>
<p>Under these conditions, I have spent all my local resources to get Phase 1 of the Hydroponics strawberries up and running, and I desperately need your support to help my plants survive.</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430649375/isx2iawhwkgxwplqmyh8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>
</p><p>My goal is to raise 1800$ and renovate this underground tank using waterproof cement with a steel float finish.</p>
<p>This requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plaster sand</li>
<li>Lake sand</li>
<li>Waterproof cement compound</li>
<li>Cement</li>
<li>Transport</li>
<li>Supervisor</li>
<li>Skilled labor</li>
<li>Unskilled labor</li>
<li>Some tools and scaffolding</li>
<li>Water to fill up the tank when done</li>
</ul>
<p>A large part of the funding raised will go towards purchasing, shipping and packaging of perks , as well as fees.</p><p>Your contribution is vital in helping to uplift this farming community because without the safety net of a water reservoir we are always a week away from disaster. You help will also ensure jobs in the local community. If you are not in a position to contribute to our campaign, we would also appreciate if you help out by sharing a link to this page on your various social media accounts!<br/></p>
<p>If I do not achieve my funding goal then I will water proof as much as I can.  Every 7 cm water proofed represents ca. 1000 liters of storage, and it would be great to water proof up to the 12,000 liter mark. Then I would able to call a 12,000 liter tanker in an emergency and that would be an enormous help. </p>
<p>If I exceed my funding goal then I would put the excess in my plant seedling nursery producing orange and mango grafted seedlings for other local farmers for the next rainy season. </p>

<p>I have fashioned three categories of perks;  </p>
<ul>
<li>sharing my strawberry hydroponics farm experience with you</li>
<li>sharing my love of mycology (mushroom spore prints/cultures) </li>
<li>locally-made and unique African handicrafts that further support our local craftsmen and artists  and make you look trendy at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are my strawberries June-bearing, ever-bearing or day neutral? </p>
<p>Get these and other questions answered on all perks below 25$! </p>
<p>Learn how to grow your own tasty strawberries and mushrooms loaded with essential nutrients.</p>
<p>I will share information about my farming experience in strawberry hydroponics and mushrooms.   </p>
<p>All questions asked <b>during the duration</b> of the campaign will be answered even after campaign end. I'm looking forward to sharing information with those interested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The spore prints/cultures will be sent by registered Airmail, with 2-4 weeks arrival time from my receipt of funding.</p>
<p>The East African ethnic products will be shipped with TRACKING estimated arrival 2-4 weeks from my receipt of funding. Please quote size of shirt required.</p>
<p>If demand is high, the hand-crafted items will have an added 2-3 week period to allow for more stock to be crafted. Items might differ slightly from picture i.e no 2 handmade items are exactly alike.</p>
<p>I hope you find something that you or your loved ones can enjoy.</p>

It has meant over 1200 visitors and 22% funded, and a campaign that is Trending in the Small Business category!   We are asking all of you to help us reach our goal.
Support the farm ""Pretty, pretty please with strawberries on top?"" :o)
The dry season is soon upon us, the rain water reservoir tank  is currently at 34 cm which is about 12,000 liters, but we need to seal it properly in order to use the full capacity of 46,500 liter!  We still need help.
Sam has chosen lovely perks, ranging from insider knowledge on growing your own hydroponic strawberries to oyster mushroom sporeprints (with instructions on how to grow them) to a variety of beautiful African handicraft.
If you visit Kololo in Kampala, drop into The Bistro where they use Sam's Hydroponic Strawberries in a popular cocktail with rum and crushed ice. Sam has dubbed the drink ""Dessert Yum Yum"". His berries can also be bought at a Chinese owned Italian supermarket and an Indian grocer- in Tank hill and Kisimenti.
If you're too far away from Kampala,  you can take some video tours of the farm with Sam: check out the ingredients required to produce lovely strawberries and have a look at all the wonderful wildlife in the area. There are new updates in the video gallery!Keep in mind that you are helping someone who is helping themselves in ""The Pearl of Africa"". If you've never been there, I found a wonderful blog which describes it so well.

This is where my brother is innovating farming with his Hydroponic Strawberries. 
All help counts to reaching our goal!xo Luba Mukibi Lynch
Sam's Hydroponic strawberries are grown on the family farm which is located in the lakeshore zone outside of Kampala, Uganda where I live and work. Agriculture is the backbone of Uganda's economy and the rich, red earth and favorable climate conditions are a blessing. Aside from Strawberries I have used my entrepreneurial and engineering skills to be a self-taught farmer in fish, mushrooms and various fruit seedlings for local farmers. Being my own boss is exhilarating as well as a challenge and I am learning everyday.
My farm relies on a 46,500 liter underground rainwater reservoir for most of our water needs.
In order to be economically viable we must use the free rain water, and store it in anticipation of the dry season. There is also a government water utility company, but, to cut down on costs and ensure that our small business can keep in business, we limit the use of expensive government water.
Hydroponic strawberries have many benefits and are easy to grow: the berries are plump and luscious and easier on your back to harvest. There is a good market for the sweet strawberries- full of vitamins and minerals. I started construction of the system and planting of the strawberries last year.
As I got ready to start my business, I did not realize that my underground rainwater reservoir was leaking!  Primarily, it was a slow leak. The full tank leaked out in 3-4 weeks and by the time that I noticed, my construction budget had also leaked dry.
I messed up.  And now, I need some help.
Today, the leak is worse, and in the film you can see how plant roots are growing and increasing the cracks. Along with hairline cracks in the walls and sides this means that the tank can now only hold 34 cm of water. That is approx. 3 days supply in the Dry season!
Last January to March was an unusually hot Dry season and it was a real challenge to keep my plants alive while they consumed 1000 liters of water per day. Unfortunately, there was not a drop of rain and the government water utility started rationing water. This meant that water was only supplied Saturday, Tuesday and Thursday from 12am to 5am.
Under these conditions, I have spent all my local resources to get Phase 1 of the Hydroponics strawberries up and running, and I desperately need your support to help my plants survive.


My goal is to raise 1800$ and renovate this underground tank using waterproof cement with a steel float finish.
This requires:

Plaster sand
Lake sand
Waterproof cement compound
Cement
Transport
Supervisor
Skilled labor
Unskilled labor
Some tools and scaffolding
Water to fill up the tank when done

A large part of the funding raised will go towards purchasing, shipping and packaging of perks , as well as fees.Your contribution is vital in helping to uplift this farming community because without the safety net of a water reservoir we are always a week away from disaster. You help will also ensure jobs in the local community. If you are not in a position to contribute to our campaign, we would also appreciate if you help out by sharing a link to this page on your various social media accounts!
If I do not achieve my funding goal then I will water proof as much as I can.  Every 7 cm water proofed represents ca. 1000 liters of storage, and it would be great to water proof up to the 12,000 liter mark. Then I would able to call a 12,000 liter tanker in an emergency and that would be an enormous help. 
If I exceed my funding goal then I would put the excess in my plant seedling nursery producing orange and mango grafted seedlings for other local farmers for the next rainy season. 

Check out the perks! I hope you find something you will enjoy.
I have fashioned three categories of perks;  

sharing my strawberry hydroponics farm experience with you
sharing my love of mycology (mushroom spore prints/cultures) 
locally-made and unique African handicrafts that further support our local craftsmen and artists  and make you look trendy at the same time.

Are my strawberries June-bearing, ever-bearing or day neutral? 
Get these and other questions answered on all perks below 25$! 
Learn how to grow your own tasty strawberries and mushrooms loaded with essential nutrients.
I will share information about my farming experience in strawberry hydroponics and mushrooms.   
All questions asked during the duration of the campaign will be answered even after campaign end. I'm looking forward to sharing information with those interested.

The spore prints/cultures will be sent by registered Airmail, with 2-4 weeks arrival time from my receipt of funding.
The East African ethnic products will be shipped with TRACKING estimated arrival 2-4 weeks from my receipt of funding. Please quote size of shirt required.
If demand is high, the hand-crafted items will have an added 2-3 week period to allow for more stock to be crafted. Items might differ slightly from picture i.e no 2 handmade items are exactly alike.
I hope you find something that you or your loved ones can enjoy.
We understand that you may not be in a position to contribute to our campaign. You can still help out by sharing a link to this page on your various social media accounts!
Thank you!

<ul> </ul> <p>Hi, I'm Cheryl. What this campaign is about is giving hope and a future to a 16 year old boy and his family from Uganda. My family and I met Regan James just last year while he was touring Canada with his school. He was happy to meet us, because we are a family of artists and so is he. Opening up to us, he told us about his dream of becoming a video editor. When I saw his desire to help others, and the potential he had to make a difference for his country, I quickly became interested in getting behind him to support him in reaching his goals. </p>
<p>What we need first and foremost is to make sure that he and his family are provided for. Our goal is for them to be able to buy property in Uganda so they can run a chicken farm. Currently Regan James and his mother and five siblings are renting a small place, and only one of his sisters is working. The others are sponsored so that they can go to school. However with your help, they can have their own property and a chicken farm to sustain them.</p>
<p>Secondly, we are supporting him to make his dream a reality. Regan James dream is to become a video editor, and produce movies. His desire is to come back to Canada so he can attend school here, to learn video editing. My husband, Jared and I, with our sons, Toby and Jairus, are very excited to have him come to live with us so he can fulfill his dream.</p>

<p>If you will join in and help alongside us, Regan James and his family will experience hope and a future. The magnitude of your contributions how ever small or large will be very far reaching.

<div>We will be needing at least $10,000 for land and a chicken farm.

If we exceed the amount, 100% of the funds will still go to him and his family, for building a house, establishing their business. The cost of the Perks you get will be covered by generous businesses like Creative Print All in Steinbach, MB and others, separate from this campaign. <br/>

For transportation we wish to purchase a 10 ft trailer to haul the collapsable dome from state to state. All of the leftover proceeds will go towards solar equipment, eventually making the dome temporarily habitable for off the grid situations.

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>Have you ever tried to learn English but had a hard time using it in real conversation?</p>
<p>My name is Jennifer England.  I am a Canadian who has been living and teaching English in Spain for close to 20 years.  Through my experience, I have come to learn that the missing piece of the English puzzle, for most of my students, is the ability to practice what they have learned, in a safe environment, without fear of failure.</p>
<p>That is why I have designed a learning experience like no other.  Here at <a href=""www.english-laboratory.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">English Laboratory</a> we are dedicated to helping business professionals, students and travelers take their English skills to the next level.  Through our innovative 2.0 program, individuals are video-linked live directly to one of our professionals who will facilitate English conversation practice. Depending on your starting point, the program lasts from one to six months. Our model consists of 3 twenty-minute sessions a week with the tutor of your choice and a Personalized Daily Training Program. This combination of increased exposure to the language, multiple interactions with a native speaker plus a custom-designed program based on your needs and schedule makes it possible for learners to reach fluency in a maximum of six months. </p>
<p>At <a href=""www.english-laboratory.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">English Laboratory</a>, we don’t want communication to be a barrier to success for businesses or individuals and so we would like to spread the word that we are here to help.</p>
<p>In order to do so however, we are going to need a little help promoting this endeavor.  The website is almost ready to go and our conversation specialists are online and eager to talk. </p>
<p>Please help us achieve our goal of raising 6600€ to be allocated to advertising and finishing the web page, so that we can start connecting people to people and begin a world-wide conversation.  After all, we at English Laboratory see no reason why our efforts cannot expand to languages around the world, building opportunities for a global village. </p>

<p>We are here growing organically in Mallorca because we love the island, and we love to grow delicious and nutritious food for others. It gives us the greatest of pleasure to know that the finishing touches on fine dining plates around the island come from us.</p>

<p>Our clients have come to depend on us, and we have a responsibility to keep growing and evolving, continually striving for the best, and always keeping ahead of trends.</p>

<p>To continue to expand at the rate that we need to we need to enlarge our growing space. As we increase our client base, and our product range, our polytunnel is getting increasingly packed. We need to at least triple our growing area to be able to continue to provide our clients with the amounts, and types of produce they need.</p>
<p>Our clients are constantly updating their menus. This means that they are always looking for innovation from us. They need new products, so we need to invest in new seeds. As our client base increases, we need larger quantities of seed. A kilo no longer lasts us long, and we need to be able to order 10 kilos of each seed variety at a time.  We also need to be able to store these seeds, so will need to buy a container for that purpose.</p>
<p>Our current storage space for our cut produce is a small, old fridge. We need to get two larger, economical ones.</p>
<p>We need to add three solar panels to our system in order to be able to run the fridges.</p>
<p>Delivery is becoming difficult, as we have a small vehicle, and our orders are growing. We urgently need to upgrade our vehicle to accommodate rapidly increasing demand for our products.</p>
<p>Being able to expand in these areas will allow us to go from a small business to the leading microgreen business in Mallorca. It's what our clients what, so we need to make it happen.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need 74,600 euros. 30,000 will get us our vehicle,  1,000 our solar panels, 25,000 our polytunnel space, 2000 will enable us to hire a digger and do the work to clear the land where we will put the tunnels, 4500 will pay for shelving for the tunnels, and payment for people to help us build them. 4000 will allow us to buy enough compost and trays for the year ahead. Another 600 will enable us to buy gravel to cover the ground under the polytunnels. This will help to stop weeds coming through.</p>
<p>3000 will buy us the seeds we need to kickstart ourselves for the year, and 2000 will buy us the container in which to store the seeds. 2500 euros will buy us the fridge space we need</p>
<p>In return for your help, you will get the chance to try growing microgreens for yourself, with our tailored kits that make it easy for you to grow these delicious, nutritious microgreens for yourself.</p>
<p>We also have in stock items labelled with our unique Els Ullastres logo. We have t-shirts, keyrings, tote bags and various other goodies.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Where we are at and where we are headed.</h3>
<p>Growing organically has always been important to us. Growing microgreens is just the beginning. We plan to develop Els Ullastres in the direction of providing a wide variety of heirloom, organic produce, initially to restaurants, and later to a wider market.</p>
<ul>
<li>Planet Earth is at a critical point. Pesticides and unsustainable farming practices are destroying insect life and pollinators such as bees, that, quite simply, are essential to our survival.</li>
<li>We have shown that it is possible to grow produce worthy of michelin star restaurants without the use of a single chemical. We plan to continue to demonstrate this with many varieties of vegetables, producing a model that can be used anywhere. We are already inspiring those around us, and have begun working with local Mallorquins, who are interested in growing with us.</li>
<li>As we develop, so too will our website. We plan (as soon as time allows) to incorporate a blog, with more detailed information about our evolution.

</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What our future holds</h3>
<p>To continue to grow organically, slowly introducing more produce, we have many learning curves ahead. Our stony land needs extensive rehabilitation over a period of years. We will need to continue to explore natural and non invasive methods of pest and disease control. We need to find cost effective ways of achieving this, and then we need to share these with our community, and attempt to slowly persuade others that growing naturally is sustainable.</p>
<p>For this, we need time. We need our microgreens business to continue to succeed. From our profits, we will begin to transform our beautiful piece of land into a productive, organic, farm</p>

<p>Three years ago, I quit my job and emptied my savings accounts to open Riverdel because I'm passionate about animals...and cheese!  Opening the first store has been great.  Our amazing team works so hard at bringing delicious vegan food to our neighborhood, and now we're taking the opportunity to serve an even wider community by opening up a second location at the brand new Essex Market in Manhattan!</p>
<p>The location of our new shop is beautiful, we can't wait for you to see it!  The market is already built out but we still need to buy inventory and kitchen appliances which are very costly.  While the store in Brooklyn keeps running, your funding will also help us to hire and train new staff, and promote some of our current staff members who are ready to grow with us and take on more responsibility.  This is exciting!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Together we can save the world!</h3>
<p>The world is a tough place, and it's even tougher for farm animals who are often neglected and abused.  Any amount you can spare will help Riverdel bring even more delicious vegan food to the world without harming animals.  We'd love for you to be a part of our journey, and please spread the news!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I have been working with individuals and teams for over 19 years to bring strengths-based living to their reality.  Whether college students, young families, managers or teams the  empowerment found in coaching people's strengths keeps making a difference!</p>
<p>Now I want to bring this to more people, families and teams more formally!  Maybe even you!  I'm launching a training and teaching business called Stately Pine.  I will hold workshops for families, coach managers and teams working with vulnerable populations and do one-on-one work with individuals.  My goal for 2018 is to reach 100 families, 3 teams serving over 150 families, and as many individuals as we can reach!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What  I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To do this I need $12,500 in start up funds.  This launch will provide the training and tools I need to become recertified as Strengths Coach through Gallup and buy the tools needed to manage the business.  </p>
<p>After the $12,500 is raised, all funds will go toward scholarships to allow families living in the crisis of poverty to experience the power of knowing their strengths and raising children in a whole new environment!  A gift of $75 will sponsor one family's scholarship!</p>
<p>You will get the satisfaction of knowing you have made a life-long impact on an individual and their families!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What are my strengths?</h3>
<p>I have taken Gallup's StrengthsFinder four times in 19 years.  It always rings true.  My top five are: Activator, Ideation, Woo, Positivity, Command.  And THIS is the primary reason why I am finally doing this.  I need to live out of my strengths, not in the briars of who others think I should be.  This is what I want for you.  This is what I want for families.  This is what I want for our communities - the truth that living out of your strengths brings hope and joy!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I have a voice in my head that says, ""Who are you to think you can pull this off?""  It is voices just like this that keep great ideas from flourishing.  I don't have plans to quit my very rewarding day job, but rather I plan to make space for this life-giving adventure - my true vocational call.</p>
<p>The only risk I have is not even trying.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Heartfelt Cycle Studio - Crowdfunding</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Heartfelt Cycle Studio is the first Queer-Owned indoor cycling studio in Columbus, Ohio. Our focus is being on intentionally inclusive and community-centered. We began as a single-location yoga studio in Feb 2020 (just 44 days before having to close to the pandemic). Despite all limitations of our first year in business, our community thrived and we became the top-rated and most-reviewed yoga studio on Google in Columbus, Ohio. This new venture is our way of expanding the community and showing that this need for representation, diversity, inclusion, and equity is needed in the cycle community as well. Our biggest challenge has been having funding for the initial bike purchase order, and facing a different level of scrutiny from banks and lendors as a young LGBTQ+ entrepreneur with a social enterprise business model. In our events over last summer, we raised 10k collectively that was donated directly to individuals and organizations of underrepresented and marginalized identities. None of that money flowed back into the studio, but we knew one day the community would come back around to help us too. And here we are, expanding the heartfelt community. We're also the only studio in town that owns two separate dedicated spaces where one is for yoga and one is for cycle. Follow along with our progress on instagram, @heartfeltcyclestudio. Grateful to have you all along for the ride!</p>

The Story

Helene Swanson, one of Katrina’s Dream four co-founders, is engaged as a spiritual duty in a yearlong
pilgrimage across the United States walking
through all 15 states rallying support in those states that have not yet
ratified the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA).  

Helene started her journey on International
Women's Day Bridgewalk, at the
Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, CA on Saturday, March 8, 2014.  She
sleeps roadside, at the occasional Good Samaritan’s home, and in churches along
her route.  
During her pilgrimage, Helene meets
with state and federal legislators to garner their support for ERA ratification
in those states. She lobbies federal legislators to co-sponsor joint
resolutions calling for the removal of the deadline imposed on the ERA
where community leaders and organizations across the country have joined her in
person and via teleconferencing during the meeting(s). Helene also helps to
coalition build.  Here is an interview by local NBC Anchor Felicia Lawrence
Helene is currently in New Orleans,
Louisiana having made her way across Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Oklahoma, Missouri,
Illinois, and Arkansas, seven of the 15 non-ratifying states.   She
is currently working with local folks and setting meetings up calling for
Louisiana to ratify this most important component of the Civil Rights
Movement.  
This coming March 2015 she will make
a trip to New York City to attend the upcoming United Nations 59th Commission on
the Status of Women and Beijing 20+ to
enlist the support of folks from around the world to urge the United States to
make women equal under the law.  
Then Swanson will return to New
Orleans to resume her pilgrimage across the USA for the ERA.  Adjusting
her schedule accordingly Helene expects to arrive in Washington, D.C. on August
26th, 2015, where she will meet with this
nation’s leaders to demand the passage of the federal Equal Rights Amendment.
Helene believes that sexism and
racism is intricately entwined and here in the USA gender inequality is one of
the many hidden faces of racism clearly demonstrated by the fact that white
women receive 75 cents to their male counterparts dollar, black women 67 cents
and brown women 57 cents respectively, and that a Federal Equal Rights
Amendment will put an end to discrimination against women and people of
color.  Please see The Pew Research Center for more facts on the Gender Pay Gap.
The Equal Rights
Amendment states:
""Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or
abridged by the United States or any state on account of sex.""
It is a simple statement that would
define the meaning of ""We the people"" to include the majority of the
population--that is women. We do not have a statement in our Constitution,
which guarantees women the same rights and responsibilities that all men have
by virtue of them being born male. The only guaranteed right that women have
under our Constitution is the right to vote--which they had to fight for almost
80 years.  In short it would balance the gender biases which also affect
those of the LBGTQ community.
Helene, an Episcopalian and aspirant
for the priesthood of the Church of North India, co-founded Katrina’s Dream in
memory of her late mother-in-law, the Rev. Katrina
Martha Van Alstyne Welles Swanson. Katrina was
one of the ""Philadelphia Eleven ""- eleven women who were
""irregularly"" ordained to the priesthood in 1974, becoming the U.S.
Episcopal Church’s first female priests. When the Equal Rights Amendment failed
to be ratified by the required 38 states, Katrina began to recite the Pledge of
Allegiance “with Liberty and Justice for SOME!” When questioned “Why ‘some”?
She would reply, “Because the ERA was voted down, retired women are more likely
to live in poverty than men.”
Katrina’s Dream’s Letter of
Endorsement was included in
Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin’s Resolution HJ 47- the “Three State Strategy” that
resurrected the ERA in 2009.
The Need
Katrina’s
Dream is asking
for your support to help cover the costs of Helene Swanson attending to the
United Nations 59th Commission on the
Status of Women.  The conference draws about 5,000 attendees and this is a
wonderful opportunity to share the progress being made with our brothers and
sisters around the nation and across the globe of the colossal human rights
movement growing here in the United States to empower women.
The Impact
The Equal Rights Amendment is a US
Constitutional Amendment that will empower women, provide Constitutional Pay
Equity and reduce violence against women, re-affirm the rights of men, and
provide Supreme Court Justices with an amendment to rely upon in ruling on
issues that affect our brother and sisters in the LBGTQ Community.

<br/>
<p>Make.Shift, Bellingham's non-profit and all-ages downtown art and music venue, is excited to announce that we 
recently received an FCC license to build a low-power FM community radio
 station in Bellingham. With the help of radio advocacy group Common Frequency, 
Make.Shift applied for the license in 2013, during what may have 
been the last application window ever for low-power FM (LPFM) stations. LPFM are community-based, non-commercial 
radio stations that operate at 100 watts or less and reach a radius of 3
 to 7 miles. Alongside thousands of new stations across the country, we received our license earlier this year and have begun the process of building up the equipment, the staffing and the community volunteers to make this station a success and to empower the community to take ownership over the airwaves.</p>
<p>We are committed to local arts and music and well over half of the music we currently play on our streaming station is local to Bellingham! Our goal is to bring to the local airwaves underrepresented stories, news and culture from our community that does not currently have a home on the FM dial. We want to empower a new generation of DJ's, journalists and local culture enthusiasts to help bring new ideas to the FM dial and to shine a light on what makes Bellingham so special. We are already streaming online and you can hear some of our first local and syndicated programming at <a href=""http://www.kvwv.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.kvwv.org</a><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>We need your financial contribution!<br/>
</h3>
<p>Creating a community radio station from scratch is not cheap and involves purchasing a whole host of equipment for the studio and the broadcast site. We have built our budget off of our own 40+ years of collective community radio experiences and models put together by community radio advocates at the national level. In order to fully fund the station and equip ourselves with the necessary gear, from in-studio microphones and mixing boards, to off-site components like our transmitter and antenna, we will need $30,000 more dollars. We have already raised $15,000 over the last several months to get us well on our way but need the support of the Bellingham community to get us fully-funded and broadcasting for the first time at 94.9-FM. Help be a part of the founding of a new community radio station in Bellingham and support KVWV today!<br/></p>
<p>You can always view our current equipment needs and an itemized budget for our first year at our website: <a href=""http://kvwv.org/donate.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://kvwv.org/donate.php</a> All money that we raise will first and foremost go to the acquiring of the broadcast equipment to get us on the airwaves and then to making our studio as professional sounding as possible. We want our DJ's and community members that visit the station to feel comfortable and at home when they visit and bring their spirit to the station.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Why KVWV needs your voice and support!<br/>
</h3> <p>Bellingham is blessed to have a thriving independent media scene, with so many local papers and perspectives adding to the dialogue about what makes our town special and how we can improve the community. 94.9 KVWV-FM seeks to fill our airwaves and programming schedule with many of these distinct voices and to put onto the airwaves the community organizations and non-profits that are working at the front lines to make our city more sustainable, resilient and respectful of our diversity of culture and identity. In our video you can see some of the great ideas we have gotten already from community members for locally produced shows, many of those faces hoping to get on the airwaves themselves to cover agricultural issues, youth and elder voices, LGBTQ perspectives, local music, environmental issues, Indigenous perspectives, local government and election coverage, Spanish language programs, local sustainability, comedy and theater, home and gardening tips and much, much more! We will also be a member of the award-winning Pacifica Network and seek to bring syndicated perspectives from across the country and the globe that are compelling for our local community.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Our goal is to be on the air by the end of this year. Starting a new community radio station from the bottom up can be a challenging task and we will need all the help we can get from the community in order to successfully fund the necessary equipment to get on the airwaves. Make.Shift has put together a talented team of non-profit radio advocates, community organizers and folks with non-profit experience who are all committed to empowering the community to get involved and to get their perspectives on the air. We have a firm deadline from the FCC for getting on to the airwaves at 94.9 FM and we have structured our campaign at the committee level, meeting weekly to discuss challenges, successes and next steps.

<p>Food For Thought (FFT) was founded in May of 2007 when a group of people came together through a passion to feed the hungry.

<p>Food for Thought, now located in downtown Toledo, provides the bulk of their supplemental food assistance via their mobile pantries. Each month they serve an average of 1,000 families or 2,500 people (in 2014 serving 10,722 households which equates to 27,910 individuals). Currently Food for Thought has 24 mobile pantry locations throughout greater Toledo, providing service directly to areas of need. At each site, patrons are able to choose from 10 to 13 different categories of food, including a variety of fresh and healthy foods. Patrons are “shopped through,"" meaning that they can pick items that they will actually use in their household from options displayed on the pantry shelves. Food For Thought will continue to focus on providing healthier food options for patrons and increasing nutrition education efforts.</p>

</div></div>","Background About a year ago, we started selling breads and pastries at the Toledo Farmers' Market to see if our uniquely Midwestern interpretations of traditional breads and desserts could find an audience.  We were astounded and humbled by the reaction we received.  Our customers are the most vocal, enthusiastic, supportive bunch of people who ever bit into a croissant.  We simply cannot thank this community enough.  Without all of you, All Crumbs Artisan Bakery simply wouldn't exist.

From the first weeks we came to the Farmers' Market, we have been asked when we would be opening a retail storefront.  We are so very, very close.  But we need your help.

Help Us Help the Hungry
 We have a great space on Adams Street in UpTown Toledo.  We have a fantastic kitchen ready to start pumping out mouth-watering creations.  All we need now is the funding to get the licensing process complete and to buy the rest of the equipment needed to scale up production.  We could continue to take it slow, and eventually be able to raise the capital we need, but we can't bear the thought of making everyone wait even longer.  So, we have a plan.That's where all of you come in, obviously.We know our customers are going to be loyal visitors to our retail space.  We have no doubts.  So, we are asking you to consider pre-buying some gift certificates for All Crumbs breads and pastries.  We have some great perks set up, all of which let our customers show their support and get their favorites at a discounted price.  But that's not even the best part.  Once we are open, we want to give it all away again.Every week as we drive back and forth from the bakery to the Toledo Farmers' Market, we pass something incredible - a small cadre of caring individuals selflessly gathering together to help feed the hungry right in our neighborhood.  Every Saturday, Food for Thought sets up a picnic in Library Square on Adams at Michigan to give away 350 sack lunches to anyone who is hungry.  It makes us want to help.  Through a partnership with Food for Thought, we have made arrangements to donate delicious loaves of our Oatmeal Wheat bread for PB&J sandwiches to be distributed at these weekly picnics.  For every dollar contributed to our campaign, All Crumbs will donate a dollar's worth of bread to Food for Thought, up to $10,000. That's two thousand loaves of bread - enough for 20,000 sandwiches!  Amazing, right?  That's still not even the best part.
If we make our funding goal and raise the full $10,000, we will make the arrangement permanent so we can donate at least 2,000 loaves every year, for as long as we are open.

This fund raising campaign is to increase awareness of the Society both within the department and in the community.
