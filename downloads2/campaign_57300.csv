In my handbag?With Pump Point your asthma inhaler will always be in the same place, your wall mounted Pump Point unit.Pump Point units mount to a wall and ensure that asthma inhalers are immediately accessible in an emergency.

Easily removed
We have invented two units to store asthma inhalers in your home.I worked in a primary school in North London for six years. Whilst working at the school I was in charge of ensuring all the children's medication was immediately accessible in an emergency. When I first started at the school all the asthma inhalers were kept in a plastic bag in the school office. One day a girl ran into the office accompanied by friends and she was desperate for air. Struggling to breath and trying as hard as she could. I ran to the plastic bag and luckily found her asthma inhaler. At this point I realised that something had to change.That night I went home and built my first unit out of wood. It was rather large, the shelves weren't straight, it had awful white paint and it just leant against the wall, but it did the job. I printed off each asthmatic child's name and stuck them in front of each hole that stored their asthma inhaler. I asked all the children that came into the office if they liked it.  They all seemed to (although I did tell most of them that I made it first - which might of swayed their opinion slightly). When staff from other schools and our school nurse came in they would always comment on what a good idea it was. I had quite an entrepreneurial mind from a young age and always thought maybe I should try to manufacture the unit but inventing, manufacturing and selling a whole new product seemed a bit far-fetched. It took two years but I finally made the decision. Asthma Pump Point units were going to be manufactured and available to schools throughout the United Kingdom to ensure that asthma inhalers are immediately accessible in emergency. After inventing the first Pump Point unit and during the two years it took me to build the perfect unit for schools, I talked regularly with parents at my school and adults that suffered from asthma and I found out that the problems we faced in schools were the same problems they had at home. They talked about misplacing inhalers, inhalers being ‘tidied away’ and I thought that I can adapt my Pump Point unit to be used in homes as well. It seemed ridiculous that there is a place for cutlery, a place for your phone and even a place for bread but there is no where to store your asthma inhaler.I invented two units for households. The units hold one or two inhalers. The units mount to the wall using 3M Command adhesive strips that stick to two small plastic tabs that fit seamlessly into the back of the units. The adhesive strips do not damage your walls. It sounds simple, but it took an extraordinarily long amount of time to design, create CAD files, and make the perfect prototype. It has been a long road but I am near completing this project.I have spent two years trying to get Asthma Pump Point into schools. Along with my brother, I have managed to manufacture and sell to schools within the United Kingdom and we are now trying to make the units available in the USA as well.To pay the mould costs and the manufacturing costs I got a loan from Start-up Loans, a government-backed scheme to help small businesses in the United Kingdom. I cannot get another loan and I do not have the funds to pay the mould and initial manufacturing costs to meet minimum ordering quantities.That’s why I have turned to Indiegogo , I need your help to get Asthma Pump Point off the ground. We have a website, a manufacturer and a delivery company.

Perfect for Beginners AND Experts in Fitness





 

GREATER
RANGE OF MOTION
Studies show that the more range of motion in your exercise the greater your muscle contraction will be.  You will also be able to keep the greatest amount of flexibility and your body strong in its most vulnerable places of injury.

 





 

HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF EXERCISES

 

 
Over 150 different exercises and videos of them are in the Fearless Personal Training App so you are never left without knowing what to do and how to do it! We are adding new videos every week with a new custom designed workout weekly to keep you challenged and excited!
 






 
NO MORE PAIN!
Common problems that prevent people from working out are hand, wrist, and elbow issues.  Whether it is from an injury, arthritis, tendinitis, overuse, and certain exercises but that no longer has to be the case!  Our straps are intended to keep the stress out of your joints and into the targeted muscles to keep you moving forward and moving longer.  You will be able to workout with less bad pain and more gain pain.  You will find certain exercises that have been a problem because of grip, tendon, or joint pain no longer be any issue!


 



 
EVERY HAND POSITION

 

 



TARGET
THE RIGHT MUSCLES
When it comes to doing most pulling exercises the grip and forearms can be the first to go and because of that the workout is never very effective.  With the Fearless Iso straps that no longer will ever be the problem.  You can do over 50 different exercises without ever even using your grip.  Not only will your forearms last but your hands will no longer be calloused and your skin won’t hurt.


 



 


EASY AND QUICK TO USE
There are other products out there that help with grip support but are mainly for serious lifters and the products are complicated, time consuming to put on or adjust, and don’t fully take the grip out of the picture.  With the Isostraps, you have the option of taking your grip completely out of the exercise, they are very simple to use, automatically adjust to your wrist, and you can just slip in and out of them.




 

 
EQUIPMENT THE ISOSTRAPS WORK WITH

 



 
PROPER FORM
It is easy to break form when there are a lot of moving parts, more muscles being activated, or when fatigue sets in.  Subconsciously we are designed to just complete the exercise at all costs and that comes at a cost of doing it right and we end up sacrificing the greatest benefits of doing the exercise.  Common issues to many exercises where the form first breaks down starts at the wrist.  Using the Fearless Isostraps, that longer will be your issue.  You will begin to do exercises like a pro because the straps force the targeted muscles to work harder and your arm positions into proper positions because you won’t have your hands and forearms to assist you.

<h3>Hallo, ich bin Hannes, Produktdesigner aus Berlin.<br/>Und da ich äußerst kreativ und hochsensibel bin und über Dinge immer aus verschiedenen Blickwinkeln und außerhalb der Box nachdenke, hatte ich oft Schwierigkeiten damit, meine eigenen Projekte zu strukturieren und ""wichtige"" Dinge zu erledigen. Ja! Ich bin leicht ablenkbar.<br/>Und diese Eigenschaft wäre als urmenschlicher Jäger sicher sehr von Vorteil gewesen, gewesen...<br/> </h3>
<h3><strong>DIE FOCUSCAP STORY</strong></h3>
<p><strong>PROBLEME BEIM KONZENTRIEREN</strong><br/>Besonders bei geistig anstrengenden Aufgaben werde ich leicht von den viel interessanteren Dingen, die beispielsweise im Raum liegen, abgelenkt, genauso von der geringsten Bewegung.<br/>Dieses ‚komische‘ Verhalten hat sich bei der Arbeit mit anderen immer nur noch erhöht, obwohl ich die sozialen Aspekte des Zusammenseins mit Menschen durchaus mag.<br/><br/>Ich wusste damals nämlich noch nicht, welche Auswirkungen das periphere Sichtfeld auf einen hat, also unser internes Alarmsystem („Kampf oder Flucht“), das für unser Überleben für Jahrtausende gesorgt hat.<br/><br/><strong>DAS STARTUP</strong><br/>Das war auch der Fall, als ich zuletzt als ‚Director of Product Design‘ bei einem der größten Möbel-Startups in Europa gearbeitet habe - mehr als 60 Personen auf meiner Etage, keine Trennwände oder ein anderer Ort, an dem man sich in dieser unkontrollierbaren, ständigen Überforderungssituation hätte verstecken können: Leute, die plaudern, Dir kurz mal ne Frage stellen, jemand auf dem Weg zur Toilette oder zum Drucker – wir nennen es: die neue Arbeitsrealität.</p>
<p>Klar, ich habe ein paar nette, kreative Projekte erarbeitet... aber ich hatte irgendwie immer das dumpfe Gefühl, ich würde da täglich abliefern - was Cal Newport in seinem NYT-Bestseller ""DEEP WORK"" ""Shallow Work"" nennt – also einfache, mechanische Ergebnisse fernab von meinen wirklichen Möglichkeiten, faktisch nie mein wahres kreatives Potenzial (Deep Work), dazu brauche ich einen FLOW-Zustand.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>SICH AN DEN 'FLOW' ERINNERN</strong><br/>Ich kannte doch dieses erstaunliche Gefühl des totalen Eintauchens aus vielen vergangenen Situationen. Da wo man sich hyper-fokussiert wie in einem Tunnel befindet. Alle meine Fähigkeiten entfalten sich dann mühelos, fast magisch und die Dinge realisieren sich buchstäblich von selbst.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>DER HEUREKA-MOMENT</strong><br/>Nun gut, ich habe mir also auf Anraten von Kollegen Kopfhörer mit Geräuschunterdrückung gekauft, die etwas geholfen haben. Aber Gott sei Dank habe ich mich plötzlich wieder an die Zeit erinnert, als ich meine Diplomarbeit schreiben musste (ich bin ja Designer und damals an der Bauhaus-Universität, haben wir viel gefeiert und coole Projekte in den Werkstatten entwickelt). Um Seminare und Vorlesungen haben wir uns meist kreativ drücken können. Als ich also diese lange, fast schon schmerzhafte Woche in der Bibliothek mit Texten zu kämpfen hatte, las ich langsam und vergas aber auch alles schon wieder. Das kam daher, weil die Studenten in der Bibliothek ständig in Bewegung waren. Es traf mich also wie ein Blitzschlag: Ich bin zum nächsten Optiker gelaufen, habe mir eine billige Brille gekauft, die Linsen herausgeploppt und daran kleine Pappkarten neben jedes Auge geklebt - und HEUREKA!!! - Diese zwei kleinen Dinger haben mein Problem im Nu gelöst: Das fühlte sich an wie ""Ein Geist wie Wasser/Mind like Water"" – ein Begriff, den ich beim Lesen von ""Getting Things Done"" / „Dinge Geregelt Bekommen“ (GTD) stark verinnerlicht hatte.</p>
<p>Schlussendlich war es doch der praktische Teil der Diplomarbeit <a href=""https://www.dezeen.com/2009/01/08/cozy-furniture-by-hannes-grebin/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Cozy Furniture Collection""</a> die ein wenig Anerkennung bekam.<br/><br/><strong>THE FOCUSCAP WIRD GEBOREN</strong><br/>Also zurück in den Großraumbüro-Alptraum unseres Startups: Ich habe mir sofort eine Schirmmütze gekauft, 2 schwarze Pappkarten links und rechts an den Schirm geheftet – et voila die FocusCap war geboren.<br/>Ich habe daraus in den letzten 3 Jahren ein einwandfrei funktionierendes Produkt mit integrierten, zusammenklappbaren „Scheuklappen“ entwickelt und patentiert. Die Kappe ist faltbar und man kann sie so einfach und flach verstauen.<br/><br/><strong>JETZT BIST DU DRAN!</strong><br/>Entweder kannst Du mit der FocusCap jetzt alles blitzschnell erledigen und das super konzentriert – oder Du hast die Möglichkeit von jetzt auf gleich an einer frischen, kommunikativen Zusammenarbeit teilzunehmen oder einfach mit Deinen Kollegen zu plaudern. Die Anwendungen der FocusCap sind endlos (Sie dir einfach das Kampagnen-Video oben an)<br/> </p>
<h3><strong>PRODUKTION</strong></h3>
<p>Ich schätzte die volle, feste Finanzierung für dieses Projekt auf 25.000 €, um mit meinem Hersteller eine professionelle Produktion zu beginnen.<br/>Nach reiflicher Überlegung hinsichtlich der Fertigstellung des FocusCaps mit einem Produktentwickler, der Aufstellung der Produktion und der richtigen Herstellerbewertung abhängig von der Höhe der endgültigen Finanzierung, habe ich die Lieferung der Caps an die Unterstützer auf <strong>September 2019 </strong>geschätzt.</p>
<p><u>HINWEIS:</u> Festgelegtes Funding (fixed funding) bedeutet laut den Regeln von INDIEGOGO, falls wir wider Erwarten nicht die 25.000 € Zielbetrag zusammen schaffen, erhält jeder seine Finanzierung zurück - ohne Wenn und Aber.<br/> <br/>Da ich schweren ‚Fokussierungs-Problematikern‘ wie mir gerne weiter helfen will, werde ich trotzdem von Zeit zu Zeit ein paar Kappen für Euch an meiner Nähmaschine fertigen.<br/><br/>Wenn die Kampagne der FocusCap gut anläuft, werde ich über eine kleine Produktion in Berlin produzieren. Falls wir aber hoffentlich ordentlich Fahrt aufnehmen, kann ich mit den großen Herstellern in Europa oder Asien in Kontakt treten und mit denen zusammenarbeiten. Die großen Hersteller werden erst mit der Entwicklung eine Produktionslinie anfangen, wenn die Nachfrage hoch ist. Hierbei wird selbstverständlich der besten Lösung der Vorrang gewährt. Ich werde Euch darüber auf dem Laufenden halten.</p>
<p>Zuvor werde ich mit einem deutschen Produktentwickler und einem Musterdesigner entscheidende Features der FocusCap und die anschließenden Produktion zu Ende entwickeln. Die drei hier vorgestellten Versionen der FocusCap können daher später vom aktuellen Prototypzustand leicht abweichen.<br/>Mein (und hoffentlich unser aller) Hauptziel dieser Kampagne ist es, ein solides, gut aussehendes und funktionierendes Produkt zu entwickeln und vor allem zu liefern.<br/>Ich werde Euch ständig über alle Entwicklungsschritte in Kenntnis setzen.</p>
<h3>
<br/><strong>WAS JEDER ERHÄLT</strong>
</h3>
<p>Ihr entscheidet einfach, ob Ihr die 'Visor'-, die' Jockey'- oder die 'Baseball'-Version der Kappe bekommen wollt - alle drei Versionen haben die gleiche Hauptfunktion – das effektive Abschirmen des Seitensichtfelds.</p>
<p><u>HINWEIS: </u>Die 'Baseball'-Version ist aufgrund ihrer Kappenkonstruktion zwar vollständig faltbar (zur flachen Lagerung), fällt aber im zusammen gefalteteten Zustand ein bisschen länger aus! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>WIR STARTEN MIT DEM WARUM / START WITH WHY (Die Tragweite)</strong></h3>
<p>Ich nehme an, viele Leute wie auch ich (Ein Hoch auf die Millenials! ... ich bin noch einer von Euch - * 1980, tada!) hinterfragen derzeit unsere soziale Rolle in der Gesellschaft und unsere Aufgabe in Unternehmen und wie eigentlich ein sinnstiftendes Leben aussehen soll. Das mach ich auch, die ganze Zeit.</p>
<p>Und langsam wird uns eine höchst interessante Tatsache bewusst: dass wir in erster Linie Menschen sind, emotionale Kreaturen mit außergewöhnlichen Sinnen. Vielleicht auch deshalb kontrolliert uns Social Media heute so gut (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E7hkPZ-HTk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cal Newport</a>).</p>
<p>An einem unserer langen philosophischen Abende mit Philipp, meinem persönlichen Leib-Tierarzt, sind wir auf folgende einfache Aussage gekommen:</p>
<h3><i>""Menschen sind Säugetiere und werden offensichtlich in der falschen Umgebung gehalten.""</i></h3>
<p>Hey! - Wir werden von denselben genetischen Programmen wie vor 200.000 Jahren gesteuert und haben völlig die Verbindung zu unserem eigenen Wesen verloren – vielmehr arbeiten wir dagegen.</p>
<p>Sind wir nicht alle einer permanenten Gehirnwäsche unterzogen? Wir werden dafür belohnt, ständig zu denken, zu konkurrieren, unehrlich zu sein und die nächsten Zielvorgaben zu erreichen - am besten in einem sogenannten ""Team"". Vielmehr sollten wir doch als Menschen damit anfangen wieder zu fühlen, miteinander arbeiten und tolle Dinge kreativ erschaffen, wie damals vor 200.000 Jahren in unserem kleinen vertrauten Stamm – für eine sehr lange Zeit ging das sogar ganz ohne Sprache! (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjGqpic7pS4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Robert Greene</a>).</p>
<p>Wir, die Menschheit, betreten derzeit ein neues Zeitalter –  das Zeitalter der Digitalisierung und Konnektivität. Und laut Joshua Cooper Ramos Buch <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KXOtK7RQ1k"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Seventh Sense"" </a>wird unsere neue große Seuche nicht der Krebs sein oder dergleichen, sondern: Die neue Seuche ist der Wahnsinn.</p>
<p>Die FocusCap als die erste von einigen weiteren einfachen Erfindungen, die ich mir in der Vergangenheit ausgedacht habe, um die kreative Arbeit zu erleichtern, soll als eine analoge Waffe verstanden werden, gegen diesen wahren „Endgegner“ ?</p>
<p>Ich glaube an die große Wirkung, die solche einfachen Tools wie die FocusCap haben können, um uns in dieser ‚abgelenkten‘ Zeit wirklich zu helfen.</p>
<p>Lasst uns unseren Verstand wieder mit unseren eigenen Sinnen verbinden, um endlich unser tatsächliches kreatives Potenzial freizusetzen.</p>
<p>- für eine strahlende Zukunft!</p>
<p>Hannes</p>
<h3><strong>RISIKEN &amp; HERAUSFORDERUNGEN</strong></h3>
<p>Ich arbeite seit über 10 Jahren als <a href=""https://hannesgrebin.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Produktdesigner </a>und bin mir über die Risiken bewusst, die bei der Entwicklung meines ersten eigenen Produktes auftreten können. Dennoch ist die Cap in den 3 Ausführungen ein eher unkompliziertes Produkt.  Nach erfolgreicher Kampagne werde ich das Cap noch durch einen Produktentwickler und einen Schnittmusterdesigner für die finale Produktion überarbeiten lassen.</p>
<p>Ich habe sowohl eine funktionierende Produktion im kleinen Rahmen in Berlin organisiert, sowie eine möglicherweise grössere Produktion wahlweise in Portugal (Europa) oder in Asien. Alles mit Fokus, die beste Produktqualität, Kontrolle und eine schnellstmögliche Auslieferung an die Backer zu garantieren.</p>
<p>Sollten dennoch unerwartet Komplikationen auftreten, lassen ich es Dich selbstverständlich umgehend wissen – sowohl während der Kampagne, als auch danach.</p>

<strong><strong>ABOUT ME</strong><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552387674/yzazgbw3s5k88ewzndtz.jpg"" src=""""/></strong><br/><br/>Hi, I'm Hannes, product designer and artist from Berlin, Germany.<br/>And as I'm highly creative and hyper-aware, thinking about things from different angles and outside the box, I've often struggled with structuring my own projects and getting ""important"" things done... <br/>Yes! I'm easily distractable. And this probably would have been a real benefit as a cavemen hunter back in prehistoric times, haven't it?</h3>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>THE FOCUSCAP STORY</strong></h3>
<p><strong>PROBLEMS WITH FOCUSING</strong><br/>Especially with mentally demanding tasks I've easily procrastinate on more interesting things that lay around the room or by the slightest movement. This ""strange"" behavior will dramatically increase when working with others, albeit I love the social aspects of being around people. I didn't yet know about the effects of the peripheral vision, the internal alarm system ('fight or flight'), that have been saving our lives for millennials.<br/><br/><strong>THE STARTUP</strong><br/>This was also the case when working in my last position as the 'Director of Product Design' at one of Europe's biggest furniture startups – more than 60 people on my floor, no dividers or any place to hide and myself placed like everybody else into this uncontrollable constant overflow:<br/>People chattering, pinging you with some quick questions, someone on his way to the toilet or printer, you name it: our new working reality.</p>
<p>Sure, I've got some nice creative things done.. but I've always felt, I delivered – as Cal Newport in his NYT-bestseller ""DEEP WORK"" would called it: 'Shallow Work' - bland, standardized results for my standards but never my real creative potential (Deep Work) where I needed FLOW.</p>
<p><strong>REMEMBERING 'FLOW'</strong><br/>And I knew this amazing feeling of total immersion from so many past experiences when being laser focused like in a tunnel, with all my capabilities effortlessly and magically falling into place<br/>and things literally 'flowing' into existence.</p>
<p><strong>HEUREKA - THE MOMENT</strong><br/>So I finally bought me some noise-cancelling headphones, it helped a bit. But thank god! one precious moment I've remembered my time when writing my diploma thesis (I'm an artist and back at the Bauhaus, we partied a lot and created cool stuff in the workshops) and most of the time we creatively found our way around almost any seminar and lecture.</p>
<p>So when I've struggled on texts for my thesis for one long painful week in the library, reading slowly and forgetting everything, because students in the library where moving, constantly,</p>
<p>So instantly a lightning bolt hit me: I've made my way to the next optician, bought me cheap glasses, popped out the lenses and tacked me small cardboards next to each eye - and YEW!!! - these two little fuckers solved everything: 'Mind like Water' (a term I've resonated so much when reading ""Getting Things Done"" (GTD). – Alas it was still my practical part of the thesis <a href=""https://www.dezeen.com/2009/01/08/cozy-furniture-by-hannes-grebin/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Cozy Furniture Collection""</a> that got some recognition.</p>
<p><strong>THE FOCUSCAP IS BORN</strong><br/>So back to the open office nightmare at our startup: I instantly bought me a visor, stapled 2 black cardboards to the bill, et voilà – the FocusCap was born.</p>
<p>I saw the potential and over the last 3 years I've developed and patented a properly working product with integrated, collapsible blinders and the cap is even foldable for easy, flat storage.</p>
<p><strong>NOW TAKE YOUR LEAP!</strong><br/>Now, you decide whether to temporarily block out the visual noise and get valuable stuff done, quickly and super-focused - or - to participate in some refreshing, communicative collaboration or chitchat with your coworkers.  The applications are endless (please watch my above video)</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>WHAT YOU GET</strong></h3>
<p><strong>FUNDING, DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION</strong><br/>I estimated the complete, fixed funding for this project at 25.000€ to set things up into a professional production with my manufacturer. After some consideration with respect to finalizing the product with a product developer, setting up the production and proper manufacturer evaluation depending on the amount of the final funding, I've estimated the delivery of the caps to the backers by <strong>September 2019.</strong><br/><br/><u>NOTE:</u> fixed funding would mean, if we won't make the 25.000€, due to INDIEGOGO's policy, everybody will get back his funding – no strings attached.</p>
<p>Due to I love to help severe cases like me, I probably will make some caps on my sewing machine for fun every now and then. - no strain attached.</p>
<p>During the campaign respective to the initial reaction and funding of the FocusCap I will either produce a smaller production in Berlin or if we hopefully hit some roof and I can check and collaborate with major manufacturers either in Europe or Asia as they first willing to start developing a production line at a high demand. The best solution will always win. I'll update you on that.</p>
<p>Beforehand I will finalize crucial features of the FocusCap and its following production with both a German product developer and a pattern designer. The final 3 different caps will be therefore advanced and may vary a bit from their current prototype state.</p>
<p>My (and hopefully our all) major goal with this campaign is, to develop and deliver a solid, good looking and working product. I will constantly keep u updated with all mayor developments.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU GET</strong><br/>You decide by your preferences whether you get the<i> 'Visor'</i>, the<i> 'Jockey'</i> or <i>'Baseball'</i> version of the cap - all three have the same main blocking functionality. <br/><u>NOTE: </u>The <i>'Baseball'</i> version though fully foldable due to its hat construction is a bit longer when fully collapsed for flat storage!</p>
<p>As described I would like to have all 3 versions of the cap (visor, jockey cap, baseball cap) developed and produced, meeting my and especially your high expectations.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>START WITH WHY (The Impact)</strong></h3>
<p>I assume a lot of people like me (This is to the Millenials! ...and I'm still in – *1980, tada!) currently question our social and corporate roles in society and what a meaningful life shall look like – so do I.<br/>And slowly we all rediscover one interesting fact: that in the first place we are simply humans, emotional creatures with extraordinary senses (btw this is why Social Media is hijacking us so well - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E7hkPZ-HTk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cal Newport</a>). </p>
<p>So in one of our long philosophic nights with Philip, my super-veterinarian friend, we came up with this simple statement: </p>
<h3>
<i>""Humans are mammals and they are obviously kept in the wrong environment.""</i> </h3>
<p>Hey! - We are run by the same genetic programs like 200.000 years ago and lost track of our own nature - in fact, we work against it. <br/>We have been consistently brainwashed and rewarded to constantly think, compete, cheat and achieve – preferably in a 'team'. Instead that we feel, collaborate and create in a small familiar tribe like 200.000 years ago – most of the time even without any language! (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjGqpic7pS4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Robert Greene</a>).</p>
<p>And now, we, the human race, are entering a new era, the age of digitalization &amp; connectivity. And according to Joshua Cooper Ramo's book <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KXOtK7RQ1k"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Seventh Sense"" </a>our new major plague won't be cancer (fuck cancer! I deeply mean it!) BUT – it's insanity.</p>
<p>So the FocusCap as some other valuable inventions I came up in the past, shall work as our analog weapons, to tackle the real boss!</p>
<p>I believe in the impact that such simple tools like the FocusCap could have, in assisting us through these distracted times. <br/>Let's reconnect our minds back to our senses to finally unleash the possible magnitude of our actual creative potential.</p>
<p>– for a bright future!</p>
<p>Hannes</p>
</div><div>
<h3>
<br/><strong>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</strong>
</h3>
<p>I have been working as a <a href=""https://hannesgrebin.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">product designer </a>for over 10 years and am aware of the risks that can arise in the development of my first own product. Nevertheless, the cap in its 3 versions is a rather uncomplicated product.</p>
<p>After a successful campaign I will have the cap revised by a product developer and a pattern designer for the final production. I have organized both a functioning production on a small scale in Berlin, as well as possibly a larger production either in Portugal (Europe) or in Asia. Everything with focus to guarantee the best product quality, control and the fastest possible delivery to the backer.If unexpected complications occur, I'll let you know immediately - both during the campaign and afterwards.

ÜBER MICH

Hallo, ich bin Hannes, Produktdesigner aus Berlin.Und da ich äußerst kreativ und hochsensibel bin und über Dinge immer aus verschiedenen Blickwinkeln und außerhalb der Box nachdenke, hatte ich oft Schwierigkeiten damit, meine eigenen Projekte zu strukturieren und ""wichtige"" Dinge zu erledigen. Ja! Ich bin leicht ablenkbar.Und diese Eigenschaft wäre als urmenschlicher Jäger sicher sehr von Vorteil gewesen, gewesen... 
DIE FOCUSCAP STORY
PROBLEME BEIM KONZENTRIERENBesonders bei geistig anstrengenden Aufgaben werde ich leicht von den viel interessanteren Dingen, die beispielsweise im Raum liegen, abgelenkt, genauso von der geringsten Bewegung.Dieses ‚komische‘ Verhalten hat sich bei der Arbeit mit anderen immer nur noch erhöht, obwohl ich die sozialen Aspekte des Zusammenseins mit Menschen durchaus mag.Ich wusste damals nämlich noch nicht, welche Auswirkungen das periphere Sichtfeld auf einen hat, also unser internes Alarmsystem („Kampf oder Flucht“), das für unser Überleben für Jahrtausende gesorgt hat.DAS STARTUPDas war auch der Fall, als ich zuletzt als ‚Director of Product Design‘ bei einem der größten Möbel-Startups in Europa gearbeitet habe - mehr als 60 Personen auf meiner Etage, keine Trennwände oder ein anderer Ort, an dem man sich in dieser unkontrollierbaren, ständigen Überforderungssituation hätte verstecken können: Leute, die plaudern, Dir kurz mal ne Frage stellen, jemand auf dem Weg zur Toilette oder zum Drucker – wir nennen es: die neue Arbeitsrealität.

SICH AN DEN 'FLOW' ERINNERNIch kannte doch dieses erstaunliche Gefühl des totalen Eintauchens aus vielen vergangenen Situationen. Da wo man sich hyper-fokussiert wie in einem Tunnel befindet. Alle meine Fähigkeiten entfalten sich dann mühelos, fast magisch und die Dinge realisieren sich buchstäblich von selbst.

Schlussendlich war es doch der praktische Teil der Diplomarbeit ""The Cozy Furniture Collection"" die ein wenig Anerkennung bekam.THE FOCUSCAP WIRD GEBORENAlso zurück in den Großraumbüro-Alptraum unseres Startups: Ich habe mir sofort eine Schirmmütze gekauft, 2 schwarze Pappkarten links und rechts an den Schirm geheftet – et voila die FocusCap war geboren.Ich habe daraus in den letzten 3 Jahren ein einwandfrei funktionierendes Produkt mit integrierten, zusammenklappbaren „Scheuklappen“ entwickelt und patentiert.

WIR STARTEN MIT DEM WARUM / START WITH WHY (Die Tragweite)
Ich nehme an, viele Leute wie auch ich (Ein Hoch auf die Millenials! ... ich bin noch einer von Euch - * 1980, tada!) hinterfragen derzeit unsere soziale Rolle in der Gesellschaft und unsere Aufgabe in Unternehmen und wie eigentlich ein sinnstiftendes Leben aussehen soll. Das mach ich auch, die ganze Zeit.
Und langsam wird uns eine höchst interessante Tatsache bewusst: dass wir in erster Linie Menschen sind, emotionale Kreaturen mit außergewöhnlichen Sinnen. Vielleicht auch deshalb kontrolliert uns Social Media heute so gut (Cal Newport).
An einem unserer langen philosophischen Abende mit Philipp, meinem persönlichen Leib-Tierarzt, sind wir auf folgende einfache Aussage gekommen:
""Menschen sind Säugetiere und werden offensichtlich in der falschen Umgebung gehalten.""
Hey! - Wir werden von denselben genetischen Programmen wie vor 200.000 Jahren gesteuert und haben völlig die Verbindung zu unserem eigenen Wesen verloren – vielmehr arbeiten wir dagegen.
Sind wir nicht alle einer permanenten Gehirnwäsche unterzogen?

Wir, die Menschheit, betreten derzeit ein neues Zeitalter –  das Zeitalter der Digitalisierung und Konnektivität. Und laut Joshua Cooper Ramos Buch ""The Seventh Sense"" wird unsere neue große Seuche nicht der Krebs sein oder dergleichen, sondern: Die neue Seuche ist der Wahnsinn.
Die FocusCap als die erste von einigen weiteren einfachen Erfindungen, die ich mir in der Vergangenheit ausgedacht habe, um die kreative Arbeit zu erleichtern, soll als eine analoge Waffe verstanden werden, gegen diesen wahren „Endgegner“ ?
Ich glaube an die große Wirkung, die solche einfachen Tools wie die FocusCap haben können, um uns in dieser ‚abgelenkten‘ Zeit wirklich zu helfen.
Lasst uns unseren Verstand wieder mit unseren eigenen Sinnen verbinden, um endlich unser tatsächliches kreatives Potenzial freizusetzen.
- für eine strahlende Zukunft!

RISIKEN & HERAUSFORDERUNGEN
Ich arbeite seit über 10 Jahren als Produktdesigner und bin mir über die Risiken bewusst, die bei der Entwicklung meines ersten eigenen Produktes auftreten können. Dennoch ist die Cap in den 3 Ausführungen ein eher unkompliziertes Produkt.  Nach erfolgreicher Kampagne werde ich das Cap noch durch einen Produktentwickler und einen Schnittmusterdesigner für die finale Produktion überarbeiten lassen.
Ich habe sowohl eine funktionierende Produktion im kleinen Rahmen in Berlin organisiert, sowie eine möglicherweise grössere Produktion wahlweise in Portugal (Europa) oder in Asien. Alles mit Fokus, die beste Produktqualität, Kontrolle und eine schnellstmögliche Auslieferung an die Backer zu garantieren.
Sollten dennoch unerwartet Komplikationen auftreten, lassen ich es Dich selbstverständlich umgehend wissen – sowohl während der Kampagne, als auch danach.
Bei weiteren Fragen melde Dich gerne bei uns, unter hello@focuscap.net

 
///HORRAY: YOU ARE ENTERING THE ENGLISH SECTOR.///

 

ABOUT MEHi, I'm Hannes, product designer and artist from Berlin, Germany.And as I'm highly creative and hyper-aware, thinking about things from different angles and outside the box, I've often struggled with structuring my own projects and getting ""important"" things done... Yes! I'm easily distractable. And this probably would have been a real benefit as a cavemen hunter back in prehistoric times, haven't it?
 
THE FOCUSCAP STORY
PROBLEMS WITH FOCUSINGEspecially with mentally demanding tasks I've easily procrastinate on more interesting things that lay around the room or by the slightest movement. This ""strange"" behavior will dramatically increase when working with others, albeit I love the social aspects of being around people. I didn't yet know about the effects of the peripheral vision, the internal alarm system ('fight or flight'), that have been saving our lives for millennials.THE STARTUPThis was also the case when working in my last position as the 'Director of Product Design' at one of Europe's biggest furniture startups – more than 60 people on my floor, no dividers or any place to hide and myself placed like everybody else into this uncontrollable constant overflow:People chattering, pinging you with some quick questions, someone on his way to the toilet or printer, you name it: our new working reality.
Sure, I've got some nice creative things done.. but I've always felt, I delivered – as Cal Newport in his NYT-bestseller ""DEEP WORK"" would called it: 'Shallow Work' - bland, standardized results for my standards but never my real creative potential (Deep Work) where I needed FLOW.
REMEMBERING 'FLOW'And I knew this amazing feeling of total immersion from so many past experiences when being laser focused like in a tunnel, with all my capabilities effortlessly and magically falling into placeand things literally 'flowing' into existence.
HEUREKA - THE MOMENTSo I finally bought me some noise-cancelling headphones, it helped a bit. But thank god! one precious moment I've remembered my time when writing my diploma thesis (I'm an artist and back at the Bauhaus, we partied a lot and created cool stuff in the workshops) and most of the time we creatively found our way around almost any seminar and lecture.
So when I've struggled on texts for my thesis for one long painful week in the library, reading slowly and forgetting everything, because students in the library where moving, constantly,
So instantly a lightning bolt hit me: I've made my way to the next optician, bought me cheap glasses, popped out the lenses and tacked me small cardboards next to each eye - and YEW!!! - these two little fuckers solved everything: 'Mind like Water' (a term I've resonated so much when reading ""Getting Things Done"" (GTD). – Alas it was still my practical part of the thesis ""The Cozy Furniture Collection"" that got some recognition.
THE FOCUSCAP IS BORNSo back to the open office nightmare at our startup: I instantly bought me a visor, stapled 2 black cardboards to the bill, et voilà – the FocusCap was born.
I saw the potential and over the last 3 years I've developed and patented a properly working product with integrated, collapsible blinders and the cap is even foldable for easy, flat storage.
NOW TAKE YOUR LEAP!Now, you decide whether to temporarily block out the visual noise and get valuable stuff done, quickly and super-focused - or - to participate in some refreshing, communicative collaboration or chitchat with your coworkers.  The applications are endless (please watch my above video)

 
WHAT YOU GET
FUNDING, DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTIONI estimated the complete, fixed funding for this project at 25.000€ to set things up into a professional production with my manufacturer. After some consideration with respect to finalizing the product with a product developer, setting up the production and proper manufacturer evaluation depending on the amount of the final funding, I've estimated the delivery of the caps to the backers by September 2019.NOTE: fixed funding would mean, if we won't make the 25.000€, due to INDIEGOGO's policy, everybody will get back his funding – no strings attached.
Due to I love to help severe cases like me, I probably will make some caps on my sewing machine for fun every now and then. - no strain attached.
During the campaign respective to the initial reaction and funding of the FocusCap I will either produce a smaller production in Berlin or if we hopefully hit some roof and I can check and collaborate with major manufacturers either in Europe or Asia as they first willing to start developing a production line at a high demand. The best solution will always win. I'll update you on that.
Beforehand I will finalize crucial features of the FocusCap and its following production with both a German product developer and a pattern designer. The final 3 different caps will be therefore advanced and may vary a bit from their current prototype state.
My (and hopefully our all) major goal with this campaign is, to develop and deliver a solid, good looking and working product. I will constantly keep u updated with all mayor developments.
WHAT YOU GETYou decide by your preferences whether you get the 'Visor', the 'Jockey' or 'Baseball' version of the cap - all three have the same main blocking functionality. NOTE: The 'Baseball' version though fully foldable due to its hat construction is a bit longer when fully collapsed for flat storage!
As described I would like to have all 3 versions of the cap (visor, jockey cap, baseball cap) developed and produced, meeting my and especially your high expectations.

 
START WITH WHY (The Impact)
I assume a lot of people like me (This is to the Millenials! ...and I'm still in – *1980, tada!) currently question our social and corporate roles in society and what a meaningful life shall look like – so do I.And slowly we all rediscover one interesting fact: that in the first place we are simply humans, emotional creatures with extraordinary senses (btw this is why Social Media is hijacking us so well - Cal Newport). 
So in one of our long philosophic nights with Philip, my super-veterinarian friend, we came up with this simple statement: 

""Humans are mammals and they are obviously kept in the wrong environment."" 
Hey! - We are run by the same genetic programs like 200.000 years ago and lost track of our own nature - in fact, we work against it. We have been consistently brainwashed and rewarded to constantly think, compete, cheat and achieve – preferably in a 'team'. Instead that we feel, collaborate and create in a small familiar tribe like 200.000 years ago – most of the time even without any language! (Robert Greene).
And now, we, the human race, are entering a new era, the age of digitalization & connectivity. And according to Joshua Cooper Ramo's book ""The Seventh Sense"" our new major plague won't be cancer (fuck cancer! I deeply mean it!) BUT – it's insanity.
So the FocusCap as some other valuable inventions I came up in the past, shall work as our analog weapons, to tackle the real boss!
I believe in the impact that such simple tools like the FocusCap could have, in assisting us through these distracted times. Let's reconnect our minds back to our senses to finally unleash the possible magnitude of our actual creative potential.
– for a bright future!
Hannes


RISKS & CHALLENGES

I have been working as a product designer for over 10 years and am aware of the risks that can arise in the development of my first own product. Nevertheless, the cap in its 3 versions is a rather uncomplicated product.
After a successful campaign I will have the cap revised by a product developer and a pattern designer for the final production. I have organized both a functioning production on a small scale in Berlin, as well as possibly a larger production either in Portugal (Europe) or in Asia. Everything with focus to guarantee the best product quality, control and the fastest possible delivery to the backer.If unexpected complications occur, I'll let you know immediately - both during the campaign and afterwards.

If you've ever wanted the convenience of working out at home, now's the time.

<p><b>No Melatonin:</b> A quick survey of ""natural"" sleep aids sold in the U.S. shows that the majority include <b>melatonin </b>in
 a chemically-synthesized form. While melatonin has its place in 
addressing certain sleep issues, users should be aware that it is a 
potent neurohormone that is available  only by prescription in many 
countries. Morning grogginess is one of the well-established potential 
side effects associated with melatonin use.   <br/></p>
<p><b>No Valerian Root: Valerian</b> is another common addition to sleep aid products. Like melatonin, it makes some people tired or groggy during the day. It also has some other potential side effects: headache, stomach upset, restlessness, dry mouth... From the Chinese herbal perspective the suggested dosage range of 400 to 600mg of Valerian Root extract is a large dose of a single potent herb. We prefer the more balanced effect of multiple herbs in much smaller dosages.      <b> </b></p>

<h4>
<b>The Theory:</b><br/>
</h4>
<p>The Chinese say that, when we sleep,
our energy retreats into <i>yin</i> (the body's physical substance) for rest and replenishment. When
Chinese herbal practitioners see sleep that is disturbed by
over-thinking and/or physiological stress, they don't look to directly calm
the mind, they look to calm the spirit—and the heart is considered
to be the seat of the spirit. The ancient Chinese understood that
many herbs help to nourish the heart's<i> yin substance</i> and, in doing so, these
herbs are said to calm the spirit. Our formula primarily nourishes
the yin of the heart when that nourishment is most effective—as we rest.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Well, first of all we hope to be able to help people...</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p>
<p><b>We'd also like to spread greater awareness of, acceptance of, and
use of Chinese herbal medicine:</b><br/> </p>We believe that the best way to further promote the use of Chinese herbal medicine is to build a body of anecdotal evidence that will help pave the way for case studies and carefully controlled clinical studies. Chinese herbalists relied on anecdotal evidence for centuries before the modern system of scientific research was developed. In  order for herbal medicine to reach and to help as many people as possible in modern times, it needs to receive increased scientific attention. If you look at an evidence pyramid, herbal medicine is currently stuck near the bottom, at the level of editorials and expert opinion. </div><div style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">

<p><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our opinion is based on our training in Chinese medicine and on our treatment experience, but it is, of course, far from scientific proof. Many controlled trials have been conducted in China, but we'd like to see herbal medicine popularized to the point where controlled trials become commonplace around the world. Our plan is to gather anecdotal evidence in increasingly refined 
ways. We're starting with simple surveys, but as we attract some interest and develop momentum we plan to move to 
scientifically designed questionnaires, independently verified 
responses, and research collaborations with educational institutions. Our work may not get all the way to randomized controlled trials, but if we diligently collect ""user feedback"" in a transparent way and make it public knowledge, we'll be moving in the right direction!</p>

<h3>Herbal Extract Information and Quality</h3><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The herbal ingredients we will use are in a granulated herbal extract form. Herbs are cooked using a decoction/extraction process that recaptures constituents and essential oils, and the resulting concentration is applied to an excipient to form the granules. We will be using one of two Taiwanese granule producers, one uses Non-GMO potato starch as an excipient and the other uses Non-GMO corn starch. We will also use vegetable cellulose gel capsules, therefore the only substances in our formula will be the herbal extracts, a  starch excipient, and vegetable cellulose. The formula will be vegan, wheat free, and gluten free. <br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The herb granules are concentrated to a 5:1 ratio—5 grams of raw herbs are reduced to 1 gram of granule extract. Because each capsule will contain approximately 400mg of herb granules, each will contain the equivalent of 2 grams of raw herbs.<br/></p><b>Quality Assurance</b><br/><p style=""text-align: justify;"">We have made arrangements with two major Taiwanese herb granule producers: both  have been in business for over 40 years and both are known for exceptional quality standards and for their strict adherence to Good Manufacturing Practices. We believe that these companies produce the highest quality granulated herbs available, and we have sourced our herbs knowing that quality and efficacy go hand in hand. The formula will be compounded, packaged, and labeled in the United States in a GMP-certified facility following strict FDA guidelines.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Finally, granule producers rigorously
test their raw herbs for contaminants before going to the expense of
making granules from them: for this reason we believe that herb granules are much
more reliably safe than raw herbs.

guys with master's degrees in Chinese herbalism have joined forces
in an effort to bring the best of this powerful medicine to as many people as possible! One of these guys, by the way, is a
practicing (biomedical) pharmacist—he makes sure that our
formulations are balanced and also watches out for possible herb-drug
interactions. Several herbal formulations are currently in development—stay tuned!!








Our Chinese herbal formula helps gently promote deep, restful sleep

No lingering effects—wake up refreshed but not groggy!!
All-natural herbal extracts, wheat and gluten free, vegan
Does not contain Melatonin, Valerian Root, or GABA
Non-habit forming, non-addictive

Help us get started by trying a 100-count bottle of our Sleep Well Formula for $17 with shipping included or two bottles for $30 with shipping included! We will be selling this formula on our website and through other venues for $20 for a 100-count bottle (a one-month supply if used nightly at suggested dosages). Our first 100 contributors will also receive a permanent 20 percent discount on all products sold through our website-to-be at bewellherbs.com!Most ""natural"" non-prescription sleep aids contain, well...stuff other 
than plants. That might be okay (might not), but we've also found that 
many of them also tend to make the next morning a little hazy. Our Sleep Well Formula contains Chinese herbal granules only and, while it might make you 
sleepy, it won't make you feel drugged. We've also found that, at least 
in our own experience and in reported results, it doesn't cause unwanted
 lingering effects. If you need a heavy sedative you should probably try another product, but if you find that stress and overthinking make it hard to get to sleep or prevent restful sleep, please try our formula!  

We have several people currently taking the prototype of our formula (the exact formulation that we will be producing in quantity)—we haven't had a bad review to date!:


Within 20 minutes I'm feeling drowsy and ready for bed. I sleep more soundly for longer periods, and I get back to sleep faster  if I do wake up! Also—no morning drowsiness!!   P.K., Wendell, MAMakes me fall asleep calmly and easily, I wake well-rested. I had a bad night's sleep the other night—I forgot to take it!!D.J., Greenfield, MAI took it at  9 and fell asleep about 15 minutes later. Woke up once to go to the bathroom and fell right back to sleep until the alarm went off. I feel like I had a good night's sleep! Thank you for letting me try it!M.H., Orange, MA   
I think your formula is really effective! I took it one night in the middle of the night and went back to sleep quite quickly and slept deeply. I took it again before bed last night and slept through. Let me know when it becomes available! S.G., Florence, MA    
I took it one evening and slept like a baby -- this during a time when 
I'd been popping awake for a couple of hours in the wee hours. I'll use 
it again when it's important that I get a good night's sleep.J.V., Wendell, MA 



No Melatonin: A quick survey of ""natural"" sleep aids sold in the U.S. shows that the majority include melatonin in
 a chemically-synthesized form. While melatonin has its place in 
addressing certain sleep issues, users should be aware that it is a 
potent neurohormone that is available  only by prescription in many 
countries. Morning grogginess is one of the well-established potential 
side effects associated with melatonin use.   
No Valerian Root: Valerian is another common addition to sleep aid products. Like melatonin, it makes some people tired or groggy during the day. It also has some other potential side effects: headache, stomach upset, restlessness, dry mouth... From the Chinese herbal perspective the suggested dosage range of 400 to 600mg of Valerian Root extract is a large dose of a single potent herb. We prefer the more balanced effect of multiple herbs in much smaller dosages.       


This is a fixed-funding campaign, which means that if we don't reach our
 goal our project will not go forward and your contribution will be 
refunded in full. We can't get halfway to our goal and move forward with
 production simply because we set our goal at the amount necessary to 
pay for our first production run and distribution costs. As soon as we reach our goal we will notify contributors of estimated ship dates. Our first production run has been pre-arranged and will take 3-6 weeks from the time the order is placed (when we reach our goal). We will make every effort to ship as soon as we possibly can!!    





We need to raise $1200 so that we can have the smallest possible batch of our Sleep Well Formula compounded, encapsulated, and bottled in a U.S. facility that is GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) certified. This will be our first production run and we've priced our perks as low as we can. We also hope that contributors will participate in our product surveys and help us spread the word about Chinese herbal medicine!!  See our ""Impact"" section below... 
You'll receive:

A high-quality herbal formula that is designed to help you to sleep better—at a low price! Each bottle will contain 100 ""0"" size gel capsules which will each contain approximately 400mg of granular herbal extracts. Suggested dosage is 3-4 gel caps taken one hour to 30 minutes before bedtime—so each bottle will contain about a one-month supply of Sleep Well Formula if it is used nightly. For complete information on herbal extracts and our quality assurance statement, please scroll down to the very bottom of our campaign page. If you have a hard time swallowing pills, the gel capsules can be emptied into 4-6 ounces of hot water—the resulting tea has, at least in our opinion, a pleasantly sweet flavor.        

Our first 100 contributors will also automatically receive a permanent 20 percent discount on all of the herbal products sold through our website-to-be at bewellherbs.com. Permanent, lifetime, non-transferable, period. We're betting that we'll make it because we're trying to do good things—and we want to reward you if you're willing to bet with us! If you think that an all-natural all-herbal sleep aid deserves a place in your medicine cabinet, this is a chance to try it at a discounted price and to secure a permanent discount on it!
















The Theory:

The Chinese say that, when we sleep,
our energy retreats into yin (the body's physical substance) for rest and replenishment. When
Chinese herbal practitioners see sleep that is disturbed by
over-thinking and/or physiological stress, they don't look to directly calm
the mind, they look to calm the spirit—and the heart is considered
to be the seat of the spirit. The ancient Chinese understood that
many herbs help to nourish the heart's yin substance and, in doing so, these
herbs are said to calm the spirit. Our formula primarily nourishes
the yin of the heart when that nourishment is most effective—as we rest.







The Impact Well, first of all we hope to be able to help people...


We'd also like to spread greater awareness of, acceptance of, and
use of Chinese herbal medicine: We believe that the best way to further promote the use of Chinese herbal medicine is to build a body of anecdotal evidence that will help pave the way for case studies and carefully controlled clinical studies. Chinese herbalists relied on anecdotal evidence for centuries before the modern system of scientific research was developed. In  order for herbal medicine to reach and to help as many people as possible in modern times, it needs to receive increased scientific attention. If you look at an evidence pyramid, herbal medicine is currently stuck near the bottom, at the level of editorials and expert opinion. 



Our opinion is based on our training in Chinese medicine and on our treatment experience, but it is, of course, far from scientific proof. Many controlled trials have been conducted in China, but we'd like to see herbal medicine popularized to the point where controlled trials become commonplace around the world. Our plan is to gather anecdotal evidence in increasingly refined 
ways. We're starting with simple surveys, but as we attract some interest and develop momentum we plan to move to 
scientifically designed questionnaires, independently verified 
responses, and research collaborations with educational institutions. Our work may not get all the way to randomized controlled trials, but if we diligently collect ""user feedback"" in a transparent way and make it public knowledge, we'll be moving in the right direction!
 Each of our contributors will be sent an e-mail with a link to our effectiveness survey for this formula. We hope you'll respond, but the survey is not mandatory. All survey results will be posted to this campaign page as they are received, in real time. Contributors will be able to verify this process, if they wish, by submitting their survey response and checking for its appearance directly after submission.  


Risks & Challenges
There is no risk to your investment in this sense: you will either receive the product we've promised you or you will receive your contribution back in full. However, in our experience no herbal formulation will generate the desired results for all people, and there is a possibility that this formula may not work well for you. 
According to the Chinese theory described above this formula MAY work best for individuals who find it difficult to get to sleep—or to stay asleep—because they can't stop thinking about problems or their work, or because they are troubled by events. The formula may be most helpful if you are tired but cannot sleep well; it will likely be less effective if you are not tired but want to alter your sleeping schedule.

Disclaimer: We have designed this formulation solely for use as a sleep aid and this campaign does not constitute Chinese medical diagnostic advice or counseling. If you have a health condition and would like to use Chinese herbal therapy as a treatment method, we strongly advise you to consult with a licensed herbal practitioner. Herbal practitioners conduct extensive patient interviews and employ observational methods to select an appropriate formula for a specific presentation. Additionally, the content in this campaign is not medical advice and you should seek biomedical care when necessary.  These statements have not been evaluated by the FDA. Dietary supplements, like Sleep Well Formula, are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease or condition.

<h3>About Me:</h3>
<p>My name is Charles Vanchieri and my passion for health has deeply rooted me within the Health &amp; Fitness Industry for the past 13 years.  I was fortunate enough to experience various departments of the industry, from private health coaching for executive families in the Silicon Valley, health club membership sales, to managing the personal training department for what is considered one of todays 'elite' fitness clubs Equinox in Palo Alto, CA.  Through my experiences &amp; discoveries, there were always common issues within all aspects of the industry; communication, connection, support, and resources.</p>
<h3>The Story:</h3>
<p>Throughout my career, I have always thought there was a place for a platform that was focused on all aspects of health &amp; wellness, one with a supportive environment and designed for both the health professional and health-minded individual.  Our health is too important for it to be an <strong>'addition'</strong> to social platforms like we see happening today on Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.</p>
<h3>The Purpose:</h3>
<p>The goal for FitChirp is to be a focused social health &amp; fitness platform where users are comfortable to share about their health, where they can build purposeful connections, get helpful support, and be an easy-to-use resource for quality information and much more.</p>
<h3>The Problems with current social platforms: </h3>
<p>- They are made for entertainment, open to all types of content, making it difficult to use them as a true resource for the useful health &amp; fitness information being created and shared.</p>
<p>- The majority of users don't feel comfortable sharing or talking about their health &amp; wellness due to the negativity that occurs on the current platforms. </p>
<p>- Searching information through hashtags, location tags, the user name is incredibly time-consuming with the vast amounts of information on the platforms and very inefficient when looking for specific health content.</p>
<p>- Building real valuable connections with health professionals is very tough to do with no ability to distinguish reputable helpful professionals from others just trying to grow a following to make money.</p>
<p>- With social platforms having no real direct focus on health, the majority of health professionals put in a lot of time, resources, and effort sharing information trying to build real connections for very little in return.</p>
<p>- The health &amp; wellness platforms that are available are targeted towards 1-2 aspects of health, weights, running, yoga, cycling, sleep, personal training etc.</p>
<p>- For an individual to consider all aspects of their health they are looking at 4-8 apps that do not connect or work together well or at all.</p>
<h3>The solution with the FitChirp:</h3>
<p>- A health &amp; fitness sharing community built for both the health-minded individual and the health professional.</p>
<p>- Find &amp; share useful information, build valuable connections, locate health professionals, and get support in all aspects of health &amp; wellness.</p>
<p>- Separate accounts for health professionals and the regular individual to distinguish the qualified professionals on the platform.</p>
<p>- Professional accounts contain an in-depth information page so users can get a better understanding of who the professional is.</p>
<p>- Professionals, users, and information are easily discoverable through the platform's simple and effective search functionality.</p>
<p>- Save and store the information wanted for later use in the account profile.</p>
<p>- A moderated platform to keep the interactions positive, supportive, and focused on health.</p>
<p>- Easily share directly to Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter accounts through the platform's posting capability.</p>
<h3>What has been done:</h3>
<p>About 4 years ago I embarked on this project, funding this myself I outsourced the development of the project to a group in India who had been working on the project until COVID-19 happened.  Working as a fitness professional, since lockdown I have been out of work and can not afford to keep putting funds into the project for the final development, the team I was using took a hit also and is not capable of further development at this time. </p>
<p>Currently, you can download FitChirp on iOS &amp; Android and find its webpage at <strong><a href=""http://www.FitChirp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.FitChirp.com</a></strong>.  So far there is the basic functionality of a social platform, the home feed, your account page, different search capabilities, posting of videos, images, plain text, and additional links.  There are 2 types of accounts a professional account which is a referral only and a typical regular user account.  To focus on health &amp; wellness there are multiple posting options for health categories and titles, both are used in the search functionality for a more precise result.</p>
<p>The app is working but is outdated, not optimized, and not efficient enough to make it a stable MVP or to start an initial marketing campaign.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What is needed to be done:</h3>
<p>I am looking to raise <strong>$65,000</strong> to fund a development team for <strong>3 months</strong> and an initial marketing campaign.  The development team has already been sourced and the project scoped, the team is awaiting the go-ahead to get started. </p>
<p>- week 1-2:  Completion of the UI/UX design, functionality, and architecture update.</p>
<p>- week 3-5:  addition of user live feeds functionality throughout the platform.</p>
<p>- week 6-8:  addition of health devices/platform connection sync with visual displays and analytics.</p>
<p>- week 9-11: addition of private and public groups with live feed capability.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Indiegogo?</h3>
<p>I had always had the idea that I wanted this to be a 'user' built platform.  Meaning the ideas, concepts, and functionality come from individuals and professionals that are in the health &amp; wellness industry, eventually platform users.  I chose Indiegogo because I currently own 100% of the platform, and at this point, I did not want to have anyone attempting to change the plan and purpose of the platform.  I think that funding the platform's development from a crowdfunding source is exactly how and hope this platform should be developed.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are always risks, that is life.  If the goal is met and or surpassed, all funding goes directly to the development that was listed above, marketing if the timing is right, and further development.  </p>
<p>I will not be taking any of the funding this is purely for platform development purposes.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>It is understood that in the current situation of the world with COVID-19 putting forth funding may be tough, if you are unable to assist with funding but do like the idea I would really appreciate it if you could share this campaign on your social platforms to get the word out to others, thank you.</p>

We do not believe that PAQ will have any trouble acquiring this certification as late model prototypes have already prevented children from entering the PAQ. KEEPING UP WITH DEMANDOne of the biggest hurdles for new product-based companies is keeping up with demand in the market. We understand this is a heavily untapped industry and are focused on growing intelligently. By taking on one account at a time, assessing the market, ensuring complete customer satisfaction, and repeating, we are confident that we have the ability to maintain steady PAR levels in order to accommodate the hungry market as we grow for both consumers and wholesalers alike.",15.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>LEO AND THE GONG</strong></h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Leo Cosendai. I'm a sound therapist, yoga teacher and gong master originally from  Switzerland. I now live and work in London, and often travel the world sharing the techniques and knowledge I've learnt from my teachers , Don Conreaux, Wendy Mandy and Yogi Ashokananda.</p>
<p>Gongs are my passion, I've seen their transformative effect both on myself, and others that come to experience them. They are a mystical vehicle that takes each individual on their own personalised adventure, offering whatever that person needs, even if they are not aware of it, a kind of telepathy with the soul! From babies to the elderly, the gong transfixes all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Born in Lausanne, I grew up learning of the benefits of yoga and the healing arts from my family. I then moved to London to train as a composer/singer, and progressively learned how to weave the use of sound as a therapeutic tool alongside teaching yoga.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This vintage 60"" gong by Paiste, formerly the iconic MTV gong, is a phenomenal healing instrument. It's currently living in a depot and would be far happier to have the opportunity to unleash its magic in London at Indaba! It is made by Walter Meyer, the revered gong maker who only made a few,  which is why it's so special. The craftsmanship, quality and quantity of precious metals used all contribute to the exceptional frequency and vibrations it omits. The stillness and peace it invokes when hearing, and feeling it played is something of a magical experience. If this all seems a bit 'alternative' for you, now's the opportunity to try it for yourself, you will be surprised!</p>
<p>Let's amp up the positive vibes of this city and give this gong a new home in London!</p>

<h2>WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET</h2>
<p>We need £20'000 to fund the whole project but are hoping to raise more in order to organise a magnificent large scale event for the benefit of a charitable cause, that will be chosen by everyone who has donated.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>THE BUDGET:</strong></h2>
<p>MTV Gong : <strong>£13'000 </strong></p>
<p>Brushed stainless steel gong stand: <strong>£1'500</strong></p>
<p>Special gong mallets: <strong>£300</strong></p>

<p>1) THE ONO<i> </i>:: 45-minute gong bath recorded with the MTV Gong, incl. a 10 minute mantra chanted by Leo - digital copy <strong>(£10)</strong></p>
<p>2) THE WOODSTOCK :: all-night gong bath with the MTV Gong, incl. a morning yoga class and a light breakfast <strong>(£99)</strong></p>

<h2>YOUR CONTRIBUTION AND MINE</h2>
<p>The success of this campaign, and thus working with the 60"" MTV Gong, will enable larger group healing sessions for a larger audience in various kinds of venues. London doesn't currently have a gong of this calibre, so this will be a first. </p>
<p>The 60"" MTV Gong is in a league of its own, kind of an instant portal to inner peace! The range of low wave frequencies it emits have an immediate soothing effect on the brain- bathing the senses into relaxation which ultimately stimulates the body's own self healing mechanisms. This instrument enables people to have the opportunity to transcend the mind and everyday stresses, peaceful = happy.</p>
<p>This is a time when finding a tool for inner stillness is key for emotional and physical wellbeing. Not everyone is able to just sit and meditate, and even if you know how to it's not always easy. This type of Gong takes you by the hand and helps you on your way.</p>

<h2>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</h2>
<p>When £20'000 is reached, you are 100% guaranteed to receive 100% of whatever it is you have contributed for in our offerings. If the sum isn't reached, you get 100% of your money back. It's that simple.</p>

Four years ago I was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa. I'm a 32 year old male. I shouldn't <i>get </i>an eating disorder. But I did. I lost 20kg and went from a healthy 65kg to a dangerous 45kg. I have a photo of me, tethering a balloon in 2012, where I look so skeletal I don't even recognise myself.</p><p>I believed I was fine, whatever the world said. Stubbornness is a symptom. As long as I exercised, tracked what I ate and lived in a bubble there was no problem. I didn't have an eating disorder. My family and friends forced to watched me blindly imploding, powerless to help.</p><p>Without Beat I wouldn't be here. They opened my eyes that the life I thought was normal was, infarct, disordered, destructive and suicidal. They showed me that recovery was possible and isolation was not the answer. Allowing my friends and family back into my life was the route to health. I cannot thank them enough.</p><p>Beat's encouragement to fight back lead to my seeking help. I put on 15kg and remembered not only what it means to live, but also be happy. I hate anorexia so much for the life it forced me to lead, what I gave up to follow it's rules.

Five years ago I quit smoking, took up exercising and started counting calories. Four years ago I was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa. I'm a 32 year old male. I shouldn't get an eating disorder. But I did. I lost 20kg and went from a healthy 65kg to a dangerous 45kg. I have a photo of me, tethering a balloon in 2012, where I look so skeletal I don't even recognise myself.I believed I was fine, whatever the world said. Stubbornness is a symptom. As long as I exercised, tracked what I ate and lived in a bubble there was no problem. I didn't have an eating disorder. My family and friends forced to watched me blindly imploding, powerless to help.Without Beat I wouldn't be here. They opened my eyes that the life I thought was normal was, infarct, disordered, destructive and suicidal. They showed me that recovery was possible and isolation was not the answer. Allowing my friends and family back into my life was the route to health. I cannot thank them enough.Beat's encouragement to fight back lead to my seeking help. I put on 15kg and remembered not only what it means to live, but also be happy. I hate anorexia so much for the life it forced me to lead, what I gave up to follow it's rules. I want to scream, shout and tell the world that anorexia is not something to accept, befriend, or manage. It can be beaten.That is why I want to plaster their name across a balloon.

<b>Can
I buy more than one x2 Sport?</b></p>
<p>
Of
course but there are only a limited number available at the moment so
don’t be too greedy.</p>
<p>
<b>Is
the x2 Sport waterproof?</b></p>
<p>
Thankfully
it is!</p>
<p>
<b>So
what is the maximum depth?</b></p>
<p>
We
feel that 10m is the maximum safe depth regular users should
repeatedly dive without getting into trouble.  As you approach
10m the x2 Sport will raise an alarm to let you know that you should
start heading up again.  The power of the x2 Sport means that
very rapid ascents and descents are possible so we recommend a very
careful approach to jet packing at depth.</p>
<p>
<b></b></p><p>
<b>Does
it come with a warranty?</b></p>
<p>
We
offer a 1 year full guarantee which will cover any genuine mechanical
or electrical failures of the system.  For accidental damage or
fair wear &amp; tear we will offer replacement parts at a
reasonable price.</p>
<p>
<b>What do you mean by standard use?</b></p>
<p>
While it would be an incredibly intense experience to hit max power until the batteries died we've found that it quite difficult to hold our breath for that long. Typically our testing sessions have run for an hour of relatively constant use (allowing for breath catching between runs) until the batteries have run dry.<br/>
</p><p></p><p><b>Is it easy to use?</b></p><p>The x2 Sport is easy to use but requires a certain amount of physical exertion and you will probably tire out before the batteries run down.  Manoeuvering requires the most physical output so the more you twist and turn the more tiring it can be.</p><p>
<b>Can
I get spare batteries?</b></p>
<p>
At
the moment the batteries are sealed within the x2 Sport and therefore
cannot be readily replaced but we have ensured that there is plenty
of capacity in the unit to keep you going.  As a future
development we will look at a removable battery system.</p>
<p>
<b>Will
there be any stretch goal?</b></p><p><b></b></p>
<p>
We
have a full roadmap of development which will take the x2 Sport from
its current prototype to a unit ready for shipping (see details
above).  We feel that stretch goals could add risk to our
ability to deliver the jet pack to you so have decided not to include
any.</p>
<p>
<b>Can
I do tricks?</b></p>
<p>
Oh
yes.  There are a variety of spins, twists and rolls which you
can perform with the x2 Sport, it’s really only restricted by your
imagination.  Some examples of a few tricks we’ve managed to
pull off can be seen in the video at the top of the page.</p>
<p>
<b>Is
the x2 Sport patented and trademarked?</b></p>
<p>
The
x2 Sport is fully patented and Supermarinovation is trademark of
S.C.P. Marine Innovation.</p>
<p>
<b>Why
is it called the x2 Sport?</b></p>
<p>
Our
final goal is to produce a four thruster underwater jet pack. 
As a step along the way we decided to start with a two thruster
system and named them the x2 and x4 to keep things easy.  The x2
Sport is the first of the x2 family which has made it to the ‘ready
for human interaction’ stage.  We have some big ideas for both
the x2 and x4 and hope to add to the range in the future.</p>
<p>
<b>Is
there an age/weight limit?</b></p>
<p>
The
x2 Sport is a very powerful device which requires a level of strength
for safe usage so we would not recommend that it be used by anyone
under the age of 14 and pilots up to the age of 18 should be
closely supervised by a responsible adult.</p>
<p>
<b>Can
the charging time be reduced?</b></p>
<p>
Charging
time can be reduced using more powerful charging devices however,
these need high amp power supplies which typical households don’t
have access to.  We can recommend a suitable charger or advise
if you will be able to use a charger you already own.</p>
<p>
<b>What
about spare parts or upgrades?</b></p>
<p>
We
have built a certain amount of modularity into the system so that we
will be able to offer not only replacement parts but upgrades as
well.  Initially, we will offer spares that will be a direct
replacement for the current x2 Sport but in the future we will be
offering improved upgrades as well.</p>
<p>
<b>Should
I take the x2 Sport out on my own?</b></p>
<p>
Underwater
activities are extremely dangerous and the ocean can be an
unforgiving environment.  We recommend never going it alone;
always have a buddy to watch your back and get you out of trouble.</p>
<p></p><p><b>Your video and pitch are just so slick and well put together, who did you get to do it for you?</b></p><p>We're flattered that you're impressed with the pitch/video and think you'll be shocked to know that we did it all ourselves.  We were certain that people would notice it was a little rough around the edges!</p><br/><br/><br/>

</div>","The x2 Sport Underwater Jet Pack
Have you ever been snorkeling and seen something incredible below you, but haven't been able to get to it before your breath runs out?  Until now you needed Scuba gear to take a closer look, but not any more thanks to the worlds first underwater jet pack; the x2 Sport. 

The x2 Sport is a wearable propulsion system that revolutionises the underwater experience bringing the adrenalin of action sports to the underwater world, enabling you to explore the ocean with the power and grace of a dolphin.

The x2 Sport can take you deeper and further than ever before.  The concept is simple; thrust generated by the patented Hydra thrusters propels you through the water faster than an Olympic swimmer.  The x2 provides the effort, saving your precious oxygen allowing longer duration dives.We designed the x2 Sport for snorkelers, swimmers, extreme sports enthusiasts - anyone that loves being in the water.  Guiding yourself through the water is a breeze; all you have to do is point your arms where you want to go.  This action vectors the thrust and the x2 propels you in the new direction. The x2 opens up a whole new experience in underwater acrobatics by allowing you to twist, turn and spin.  You're only limited by your imagination and the best part is that your hands will be free enabling you to stop to take photos.You
control your speed using a handy throttle grip which is attached to
you (so don't worry about letting it go, you won't lose it).  The analogue trigger gives you total control over how fast you go, so
you can cruise along at a relaxed pace or hammer it at a top speeds in excess of 6mph!

production methods, reduce assembly time and improve build quality.

Some
of the things that we desperately need are a walk in spray booth, a
much larger testing tank, a permanent component testing rig and a
bigger CNC machine - not to mention more 3D printers! 

Other
Ways You Can Help 


If
don't want an x2 Sport for yourself but are still interested in helping us succeed, then don't forget you can donate any amount without selecting a perk.  All donations are gratefully received and every person who pledges will get their name on our Wall of Fame.

Please share our Indiegogo campaign as much as you possibly can on Facebook and Twitter.  We need your help to get the word out!
There are some cool things that we want to add to the x2 Sport before it's ready for official release, such as a full sensor suite, smart battery management and a refined throttle system.Once we've managed to squeeze all that good stuff in we'll go through a period of shakedown testing to make sure it's all working as we expect, before moving into full scale production, ready for shipping out rewards c.September 2016.A successful Indiegogo campaign is hopefully just the beginning of our journey.  We have lots of exciting ideas for the future of the underwater jet pack which will build on the core experience.The jet pack was born from two things; a dream to explore the underwater world deeper and further than before coupled with a desire to recreate the intense experience of skydiving for somebody that is afraid of heights!The result was the x2 Sport; a device which enabled us to push our boundaries in the water without the need for Scuba gear and provides a thrilling ride along the way.We've been working on the jet pack for about 36 months and what started as nothing more than a few components strewn about our Dad's shed has transformed into a fully functioning prototype.
Supply:  The
jet pack brings together a number of components which we've
attempted, where possible, to source locally.  In some instances
availability and price have meant that we've had to go further afield
to place orders but we've identified suppliers that we're confident
can provide us with a reliable service.Manufacturing:  All jet packs will be manufactured
and assembled by us at our facility in Portsmouth and as such there
is a limit to the rate at which we can put them together.  We have
plans to expand our capabilities in the near future and are confident that we'll be able to deliver all rewards. 



Quality
Control:  We'll check all of the
assembled jet packs in house using our custom testing facilities and
nothing will be shipped until we are totally happy.

Can
I buy more than one x2 Sport?

Of
course but there are only a limited number available at the moment so
don’t be too greedy.

Is
the x2 Sport waterproof?

Thankfully
it is!

So
what is the maximum depth?

We
feel that 10m is the maximum safe depth regular users should
repeatedly dive without getting into trouble.  As you approach
10m the x2 Sport will raise an alarm to let you know that you should
start heading up again.  The power of the x2 Sport means that
very rapid ascents and descents are possible so we recommend a very
careful approach to jet packing at depth.


Does
it come with a warranty?

We
offer a 1 year full guarantee which will cover any genuine mechanical
or electrical failures of the system.  For accidental damage or
fair wear & tear we will offer replacement parts at a
reasonable price.

What do you mean by standard use?

While it would be an incredibly intense experience to hit max power until the batteries died we've found that it quite difficult to hold our breath for that long. Typically our testing sessions have run for an hour of relatively constant use (allowing for breath catching between runs) until the batteries have run dry.
Is it easy to use?The x2 Sport is easy to use but requires a certain amount of physical exertion and you will probably tire out before the batteries run down.  Manoeuvering requires the most physical output so the more you twist and turn the more tiring it can be.
Can
I get spare batteries?

At
the moment the batteries are sealed within the x2 Sport and therefore
cannot be readily replaced but we have ensured that there is plenty
of capacity in the unit to keep you going.  As a future
development we will look at a removable battery system.

Will
there be any stretch goal?

We
have a full roadmap of development which will take the x2 Sport from
its current prototype to a unit ready for shipping (see details
above).  We feel that stretch goals could add risk to our
ability to deliver the jet pack to you so have decided not to include
any.

Can
I do tricks?

Oh
yes.  There are a variety of spins, twists and rolls which you
can perform with the x2 Sport, it’s really only restricted by your
imagination.  Some examples of a few tricks we’ve managed to
pull off can be seen in the video at the top of the page.

Is
the x2 Sport patented and trademarked?

The
x2 Sport is fully patented and Supermarinovation is trademark of
S.C.P. Marine Innovation.

Why
is it called the x2 Sport?

Our
final goal is to produce a four thruster underwater jet pack. 
As a step along the way we decided to start with a two thruster
system and named them the x2 and x4 to keep things easy.  The x2
Sport is the first of the x2 family which has made it to the ‘ready
for human interaction’ stage.  We have some big ideas for both
the x2 and x4 and hope to add to the range in the future.

Is
there an age/weight limit?

The
x2 Sport is a very powerful device which requires a level of strength
for safe usage so we would not recommend that it be used by anyone
under the age of 14 and pilots up to the age of 18 should be
closely supervised by a responsible adult.

Can
the charging time be reduced?

Charging
time can be reduced using more powerful charging devices however,
these need high amp power supplies which typical households don’t
have access to.  We can recommend a suitable charger or advise
if you will be able to use a charger you already own.

What
about spare parts or upgrades?

We
have built a certain amount of modularity into the system so that we
will be able to offer not only replacement parts but upgrades as
well.  Initially, we will offer spares that will be a direct
replacement for the current x2 Sport but in the future we will be
offering improved upgrades as well.

Should
I take the x2 Sport out on my own?

Underwater
activities are extremely dangerous and the ocean can be an
unforgiving environment.  We recommend never going it alone;
always have a buddy to watch your back and get you out of trouble.
Your video and pitch are just so slick and well put together, who did you get to do it for you?We're flattered that you're impressed with the pitch/video and think you'll be shocked to know that we did it all ourselves.  We were certain that people would notice it was a little rough around the edges!",20.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Professor Timothy Skinner, a diabetes researcher from Charles Darwin University in the Northern Territory of Australia, and Professor Isabelle Skinner,  rural health and telehealth specialist, have teamed up with designer D'Arcy Ellis to make a difference for people with type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>Through our years of research and clinical practice, we have discovered the most effective way to support people with lifestyle change: for weight loss, increasing exercise, making dietary changes, improving mental health and reducing diabetes distress.  To help people with type 2  diabetes, we have used this knowledge to develop an app,  <strong>emojifit Diabetes</strong>.</p>

<h3>The emojifit Story</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The language of emojis is a global language that we have harnessed for good.</p>
<p>We have added a range of health and wellbeing emojis to the standard dictionary of fun and quirky emojis that we all know so well. With our expanded library we have made an app called emojifit Diabetes that is easy to use and can be understood by people everywhere.</p>
<p>The emojifit pictorial library communicates health and wellbeing information to support lifestyle change including:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>feelings,</li>
<li>emotions,</li>
<li>confidence,</li>
<li>activities,</li>
<li>food to eat and</li>
<li>foods to avoid.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Some emojis are used to communicate medical conditions such as high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high cholesterol, and depression and their complications.  Emojis form the basis or our app to help people focus on lifestyle changes that are targeted to address their biggest concern.</p>

<p>To support everyone with Type 2 Diabetes to have access to evidence-based self management support Tim, Isabelle, D'Arcy, Ling An and the team at Decision Support Analytics have  developed emojifit Diabetes.</p>

With that, we have been able to make emojifit Diabetes for iPhones (iOS).

<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Now we need your help to produce it for Android.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h2>Why it is needed</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>It is estimated that 101 million people with diabetes have an android phone, whilst 17 million people with diabetes around the world use an iPhone.  </p>
<p>We know that everyone with diabetes wants to live a long life, free from the complications of diabetes.</p>
<p>We know people with diabetes are interested in using emojifit to manage their lifestyle goal-setting because, in the months since we launched, people from 31 countries as diverse as America, Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil and Thailand have downloaded and are using the app.</p>
<p>Lots of Android users have asked us to make the app available for them. Diabetes is a big global problem and getting bigger. We believe we can help slow down the rise. We need you to believe with us.</p>

Get together with us to make emojifit Diabetes in Indigenous and minor languages
Emojis do most of the communication work in the App but there are small amounts of text that are really important to help people with Type 2 Diabetes understand their risk factors, the complications and how these can be managed.
For example:
Heart Disease- 
Heart disease happens when the arteries supplying blood to your heart, to make it pump, get blocked.  Without the blood, parts of the heart get damaged and don’t work any more.
Result: you risk having a heart attack
If you are a speaker of one of the world's Indigenous languages, or one of the world's minor languages you may want to get in touch and help us with translation 
 
We need your help 
Together we can reach every part of the Earth to provide evidence-based support for people with Type 2 Diabetes.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The AirPhysio Community Benefits Program</h3>
<p>Over the last two years we have designed and built the new AirPhysio device to help sufferers of respiratory ailments to help clean and exercise their lungs, as well as maximise the effects of any medication. Although low cost, we want to get it to those who are less fortunate and who really need the device as some people with these conditions can't work as they struggle to simply take a breath.</p>
<p>These are the people we particularly want to help and we have designed our Community Benefits Program to get these devices out there through various worldwide organisations.</p>
<p><strong><i>If we can save or help to change just lives, then we will have achieved our own personal vision. The amount of children suffering from Chronic Asthma and Cystic Fibrosis is unbelievable and we would like to help change their lives so that they can live a more fulfilling lifestyle.</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>We want and need your help to realise this vision!</i></strong></p>
<p><i><strong>Please see how just 1 device has changed a child's life, imagine what 1,000 or more devices can do.</strong></i></p>
<p><i>""My son Jet gets chronic asthma and became dependent on asthma medication, to the point where as soon as he stopped the medicine he would start getting a chest cold. Through winter he is the first one to get a cold and since his asthma started, he has never finished a cross country or any sporting events without an asthma attack and the need for a puffer.<br/><br/>Jet started using <strong>AirPhysio</strong> for the first time only a couple of months ago, but the results have been amazing. Not only has he not had a cold or flu so far this winter (which is an accomplishment in itself), but since starting to use the device, Jet not only finished his first cross country without an asthma attack, but he actually made it to district as well as weekly football and daily surfing.<br/><br/>I love this device, my son has managed to kick his dependency on medicines and he is improving his fitness. Now if only I could get him to use it every day I’d be happy.""<br/><strong>Varley Frazer</strong><br/>NSW North Coast, Australia</i></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Where Have We Come From?</h3>
<p><strong>AirPhysio</strong> came about from three business partners in Australia coming across a 20 year old mucus clearance device. At the time we thought, ""what a great idea - where do we get one?"" We then found out that these devices were hard to obtain and even more concerning, were not that well known by many in the health care industry.</p>
<p>We were passionate about helping others and this device ticked all of the boxes when we realised how much good it could do to help people with respiratory conditions to breathe easier. We believed that strongly in the device that we spent two years researching, designing, testing and gaining validation from the medical profession to create the new <strong>AirPhysio </strong>device (short for <strong>air</strong>way <strong>physio</strong>therapy). With business, engineering and medical backgrounds within our team we knew we could improve on the old technology.  The interest is high, the research complete, all the certification, validations and approvals required have been done.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504833364/vndvavctgupozccnzvds.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>AirPhysio</strong> is now ready for the international market, and an important part of that is to also launch a Community Benefit Program. This will enable us to take these devices to areas less fortunate and we will be working with various project teams and charitable organisations to do this.</p>
<p><strong>We have already heard some amazing stories of how the AirPhysio device has helped make major changes in people’s lives, now we need support to enable us to produce AirPhysio to help more people on a global scale. Funds raised via this campaign will allow us to increase production, provide education, gain health and compliance approvals in more countries, employ more people and best of all, help more and more people around the world to gain access to this device to breathe easier, naturally!</strong></p>

<h3>Sounds Great - But What IS AirPhysio?</h3>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rh5Mq5ZuZ0A?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>AirPhysio</strong> is a natural lung expansion and mucus clearance device that operates on the principles of <strong><i>‘Oscillating Positive Expiratory Pressure’ </i></strong>(OPEP). Blowing into the device causes the airway walls inside of the lungs to oscillate <strong><i>(you can actually feel it working immediately</i>)</strong>, shaking loose contaminated mucus and opening up the airways. It assists the body’s natural method of keeping the lungs hygienic by removing mucus and contaminants from the lungs and helps to maintain maximum lung capacity for users by opening up an block, closed or semi closed airways. There are 3 primary markets for <strong>AirPhysio:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><i>Adults and children with existing respiratory conditions (asthma, COPD, cystic fibrosis etc)</i></li>
<li><i>Those seeking to mitigate the effects of air pollution on their health</i></li>
<li><i>Individuals wishing to maintain maximum lung capacity for sports and general health</i></li>
</ol>
<p>PEP devices have been in the public domain since the 1980’s and have primarily been promoted to individuals with an existing respiratory condition as a symptom alleviating product. A particular phenomenon in the manufacturing space with PEP devices has been the highly static nature of design and additional functionality - most PEP devices have received little or no development from launch. Also many are just another product sold by a larger company. A huge point of difference for <strong>AirPhysio</strong> is that it is all we do, and all we sell - we are 100% dedicated to our product and its future. Already a huge amount of new research and redesign has taken place.</p>

<h3>An Instant INTERNATIONAL AWARD WINNER!</h3>
<p>Australian made <strong>AirPhysio</strong> was invited to the Yiwu Imported Commodities Fair in China during May, 2017. It was held at the Yiwu International Expo Centre covering over 150,000 square metres of space and received over 500,000 visitors.</p>
<p><strong>AirPhysio</strong> presented the device to around 60 key distributors and displayed our product on the CAUNZ stand at the fair. <i><strong>AirPhysio won the prestigious Best Product award over 3,500 other exhibitors with around 100,000 products in the fair in total.</strong></i></p>

ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust. Here are some
things to do in this section:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce yourself and your
     background.</li>
<ul>
<li>My name is Indu Aima married and
      have two children. I used to work as a computer teacher until I started
      observing challenges due to Thyroid dysfunction.
      To juggle between daily chores at home, work and parenting the kids was a
      herculean task and the thyroid dysfunction was having a huge negative impact
      on my health and life. Unfortunately my husband was also detected with
      thyroid dysfunction around the same time. We both struggled to get our
      health back on track but this could not happen until we took it up on ourselves.  Though information sources have been available in abundance in the form of books,
      web links, twitter chats etc. they are either confusing, misleading or at times do not help beyond a point and consume a lot of
      time. We were always envisioning a solution that will provide health
      status in a click for an individual. While figuring out modes to take our
      solution to a large market we chose mobile phones because of their
      presence among 6.9 billion people
      worldwide about 95%
      of the world population. Our vision was also to empower each individual
      to do the first pass tests by looking at the symptoms survey and
      self-test routine. In case the problem exists the individual can do blood tests, feed the results in to the app and get their unique thyroid profile, complete diagnosis along with information on suggested cure, self-treatment routine, do's &amp; don't's, and supporting educational material.</li>
<li>Our aim is to not let anyone
      endure what we went through in last 10 yrs. We have started <b>MyHealth
      Thyroid – An App</b> that’s an example and an inspiration for all those
      people suffering with Thyroid dysfunction with insights on how to come
      out of it and help spreading the gospel around. </li>
</ul>
<li>Briefly describe your campaign
     and why it's important to you.</li>
<ul>
<li>Experts claim that thyroid
      dysfunction is the next epidemic to be dealt worldwide. The tough job on hand is two fold - on one side we have to detect the dysfunction and on the other
      we have to fix it. We have developed an analytics &amp; cloud based
      solution that we are expecting would solve both the issues of detecting and
      correcting the problem by fixing it at the root cause.</li>
<li>To begin with our campaign's top 3 priorities are to <b>improve reach, awareness, and affordability</b>. With all our savings and best possible support received from few friends we have been able to develop and launch the app
      on android platform. There is a vast majority of people on other
      platforms as well who are yet to be benefited. To help stop this dysfunction we have to quickly make
      it available to them as well. We have to find ways to reduce the cost and make this solution affordable to more and more
      people.  We would also like to
      improve the awareness about the dysfunction by conducting awareness and
      educational campaigns.  </li>
</ul>
<li>Express the magnitude of what
     contributors will help you achieve.</li>
<ul>
<li>We are expecting that we will
      need around <u>USD 1,000,000</u> to achieve the following goals:</li>
<ul>
<li>Improve affordability - Reduce the cost of report to
       make it available to those who cannot afford it</li>

<ul>
<li>Explain how much funding you
     need and where it's going. Be transparent and specific-people need to trust
     you to want to fund you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our dream is to make our solution available to
all parts of the world and help people tide over the thyroid dysfunction
epidemic. We do not want others to suffer like we did over the last 10 years.
We cannot make this happen overnight nor can we fulfill this dream without your
support and contribution. We are positive you will join us in this journey to
fight this epidemic worldwide. Every drop makes the ocean and we need to build
an ocean to scale this solution and fulfill every individual’s dream.</p><p></p><table>

<ul>
<li>Build a safety stock of materials so that we're not at supply risk</li>

<li>Expand our capacity</li>

<h3>What will the money be spent on?</h3>
<p>The collected funds will be spent on the production of medical masks that are needed as a prevention of the Covid-19 pandemic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Free distribution of masks near the lobbies of metro stations.</li>
<li>Free distribution of masks near the streets of the city for the poor and homeless.</li>
<li>Free distribution of masks to ordinary people.</li>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>In the wake of COVID-19</strong> people of all ages and backgrounds are now facing a hard reality that social distancing from family, friends, and community members may be a new norm.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Understandably, society is seeking solutions to ensure adults (16+) have access to solutions that <strong>will support their mental health during such time while they are isolated</strong> due to social distancing and lockdown  measures.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>People need and crave human connections and research has shown us why it is essential for our wellbeing</strong>. It is the core of how we as humans pass our wisdom and learning onto each other and is a <strong>vital aspect in maintaining a state of good mental &amp; emotional health.</strong> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1588043949/pxlrwoizohmmwdike8ky.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Virtual Reality (VR) is the new specialized wellness and mental health tool</strong>. It allows anyone to connect and learn techniques and tools from Personal Growth and Wellness coaches <strong>that address anxiety, overcoming fears, rising above depression, and mindfulness practices that reduce stress from anywhere. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>At Beams of Light, we understand people of all ages seek an ongoing deeper relationship with the human teaching experiences that no phone or screen can replace.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That’s why we are developing a collection of immersive wellness virtual reality video experiences titled,<strong> “Rise Together”.</strong> It will allow adults (16+) with mild mental health issues to escape the confinement of their homes and step inside the highest quality wellness experiences with the use of a Oculus Go virtual reality headset. </p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>“Rise Together”</strong> is a collection of mindfulness and mental health virtual reality video experiences designed for adults (16+) suffering from stress, anxiety and mild depression caused by social distancing and self isolation .</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>These videos will be bundled into a virtual reality app</strong> that will allow users to easily choose from a range of wellness related subjects. These subjects are designed to help you cope with the effects of social distancing and COVID-19. </p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>The VR video experiences are divided into two groups.</strong></h3>
<p>The first group of VR experiences allows you to feel like <strong>you are having a one-on-one teaching experience with personal growth &amp; wellness based experts</strong>. These experiences would cover topics such as how to cope with anxiety, overcoming fear, how to stay motivated as an entrepreneur, etc.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>The second group of VR experiences to be included in the Rise Together VR app are mindfulness based experiences. <strong>These would focus on reducing stress and promote relaxation techniques</strong> by transporting you into the middle of some of North Americas most scenic and beautiful outdoor environments.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Rise Together is designed to be incredibly accessible and easy to use with no prior technical skills required. </h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Using an Oculus Go VR headset (which we are including)</strong> , an adult (16+) suffering from mild mental health issues can simply download the Rise Together app from the Oculus VR app store and begin viewing multiple inspiring VR experiences centered around mental health &amp; wellness at the touch of a button.</p>

<p>The majority of the population are faced with the<strong> stresses of being out of work, parenting and schooling their children, and financial burdens</strong> which were not present prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, pre-diagnosed mild to moderate mental health patients are more easily prone to stresses than the general population.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Directly speaking<strong>, Rise Together is designed to aid in the positive mental health of adults (16+) suffering with increased anxiety, fears, and stresses due to a lack of social </strong><strong>interaction or economic pressures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.</strong></p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Rise Together VR application will help you:</h3> <p>Reduce isolation by having instant access to wellness coaches and environments; </p>
<p>Encourage maintenance of social distancing as people will be less tempted to go to public areas if they can access them through VR (we miss the real thing too but experts have shown this will help).</p>
<p>Experiences set in nature based settings offer additional health benefits such as:</p>
<p><strong>increased immune function, lowered blood pressure, stress relief, improved academic success, etc.</strong></p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>PHASE 1 Funding</h3>
<p>We currently have the initial app set up but would require the funds in this phase to pay for our content delivery system and media encoding software to allow streaming and downloading of the Rise Together VR experiences. Additionally, we are going to produce another half dozen mindfulness VR experiences to add to the existing content we have ready for you. This phase gets Rise Together in your hands asap.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>PHASE 2 (Stretch Goal)</h3>
<p>Our next funding goal after the initial rollout of Rise Together is to produce and add more content to the existing Rise Together VR platform and have our developers make some improvements on the app itself that would allow for a greater degree of personalization inside the app experience.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>PHASE 3 (Stretch Goal)</h3>
<p>We plan to use the funds raised in this phase to develop a website that can offer free online tools to help those undergoing stress and anxiety during self isolation. We want to use the website and funds to offer those most in need the ability to apply to receive unlimited access to Rise Together including a free VR headset shipped to their home (partnering with a social service/ non-profit is also considered). Lastly, We are going to have an independent neuro research study done using Rise Together to help us optimize and improve the app and make future content more effective.</p>

<h2>The Impact &amp; Benefits Rise Together Can Have</h2>
</div><div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Rise Together is poised to benefit a tremendous amount of people</strong> living in both urban and rural environments suffering various mild mental health concerns due to COVID-19.</p> <p>Under normal conditions, urban residents tend to find being outdoors relaxing and a relief from the stresses of everyday urban life. Now that people are required to self-isolate and socially distance due to COVID-19, the mindfulness based outdoor experiences from this pilot project gives them the opportunity to <strong>experience the benefits of nature without the risk of leaving home. </strong></p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Introducing the aspect of having one-on-one teaching experiences in VR with wellness coaches would<strong> add an aspect of emotional support</strong> and sense of social interaction for residents living in urban and especially rural environments.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>A study published in <strong>Nature Neuroscience</strong>, “finds that social interactions can have a profound effect on behaviors related to addiction, and on the brain’s response to drug-associated cues. These findings have implications for people with substance use disorders (SUDs), because it suggests that <strong>social interaction can change the activity of specific neuronal circuits that control drug craving and relapse</strong>”.</p>

<p>Rise Together VR experiences promotes social interaction to isolated individuals and <strong>offers a lifelike human teaching experience thanks to the immersive nature of virtual reality</strong>.</p>

In the wake of COVID-19 people of all ages and backgrounds are now facing a hard reality that social distancing from family, friends, and community members may be a new norm.
 
Understandably, society is seeking solutions to ensure adults (16+) have access to solutions that will support their mental health during such time while they are isolated due to social distancing and lockdown  measures.  
 
People need and crave human connections and research has shown us why it is essential for our wellbeing. It is the core of how we as humans pass our wisdom and learning onto each other and is a vital aspect in maintaining a state of good mental & emotional health. 
 

 
Virtual Reality (VR) is the new specialized wellness and mental health tool. It allows anyone to connect and learn techniques and tools from Personal Growth and Wellness coaches that address anxiety, overcoming fears, rising above depression, and mindfulness practices that reduce stress from anywhere. 
 
At Beams of Light, we understand people of all ages seek an ongoing deeper relationship with the human teaching experiences that no phone or screen can replace.
 
That’s why we are developing a collection of immersive wellness virtual reality video experiences titled, “Rise Together”. It will allow adults (16+) with mild mental health issues to escape the confinement of their homes and step inside the highest quality wellness experiences with the use of a Oculus Go virtual reality headset. 
 
 
How Rise Together Works 
 

 
“Rise Together” is a collection of mindfulness and mental health virtual reality video experiences designed for adults (16+) suffering from stress, anxiety and mild depression caused by social distancing and self isolation .
 
These videos will be bundled into a virtual reality app that will allow users to easily choose from a range of wellness related subjects. These subjects are designed to help you cope with the effects of social distancing and COVID-19. 
 

 
The VR video experiences are divided into two groups.
The first group of VR experiences allows you to feel like you are having a one-on-one teaching experience with personal growth & wellness based experts. These experiences would cover topics such as how to cope with anxiety, overcoming fear, how to stay motivated as an entrepreneur, etc.
 

 
The second group of VR experiences to be included in the Rise Together VR app are mindfulness based experiences. These would focus on reducing stress and promote relaxation techniques by transporting you into the middle of some of North Americas most scenic and beautiful outdoor environments.
 
  
 
Rise Together is designed to be incredibly accessible and easy to use with no prior technical skills required. 
 
Using an Oculus Go VR headset (which we are including) , an adult (16+) suffering from mild mental health issues can simply download the Rise Together app from the Oculus VR app store and begin viewing multiple inspiring VR experiences centered around mental health & wellness at the touch of a button.
 

 
 
How It will Help Fight Covid-19?
 

 
The majority of the population are faced with the stresses of being out of work, parenting and schooling their children, and financial burdens which were not present prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, pre-diagnosed mild to moderate mental health patients are more easily prone to stresses than the general population.  
 
Directly speaking, Rise Together is designed to aid in the positive mental health of adults (16+) suffering with increased anxiety, fears, and stresses due to a lack of social interaction or economic pressures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
 

 
Rise Together VR application will help you: Reduce isolation by having instant access to wellness coaches and environments; 
Encourage maintenance of social distancing as people will be less tempted to go to public areas if they can access them through VR (we miss the real thing too but experts have shown this will help).
Experiences set in nature based settings offer additional health benefits such as:
increased immune function, lowered blood pressure, stress relief, improved academic success, etc.

What We Need To Make Rise Happen & What You Get
 
We need your help right now to make an awe inspiring virtual reality wellness & mental health app to help address the stress, anxiety and fear caused by Covid-19 and this is how we plan to use your contribution.   


 
PHASE 1 Funding
We currently have the initial app set up but would require the funds in this phase to pay for our content delivery system and media encoding software to allow streaming and downloading of the Rise Together VR experiences. Additionally, we are going to produce another half dozen mindfulness VR experiences to add to the existing content we have ready for you. This phase gets Rise Together in your hands asap.
 
PHASE 2 (Stretch Goal)
Our next funding goal after the initial rollout of Rise Together is to produce and add more content to the existing Rise Together VR platform and have our developers make some improvements on the app itself that would allow for a greater degree of personalization inside the app experience.
 
PHASE 3 (Stretch Goal)
We plan to use the funds raised in this phase to develop a website that can offer free online tools to help those undergoing stress and anxiety during self isolation. We want to use the website and funds to offer those most in need the ability to apply to receive unlimited access to Rise Together including a free VR headset shipped to their home (partnering with a social service/ non-profit is also considered). Lastly, We are going to have an independent neuro research study done using Rise Together to help us optimize and improve the app and make future content more effective.

The Impact & Benefits Rise Together Can Have

 
Rise Together is poised to benefit a tremendous amount of people living in both urban and rural environments suffering various mild mental health concerns due to COVID-19. Under normal conditions, urban residents tend to find being outdoors relaxing and a relief from the stresses of everyday urban life. Now that people are required to self-isolate and socially distance due to COVID-19, the mindfulness based outdoor experiences from this pilot project gives them the opportunity to experience the benefits of nature without the risk of leaving home. 
 
 Studies have found outdoor mindfulness and nature bathing experiences help reduce stress, increase immune function, lower blood pressure, lower anxiety levels, reduce depression and suicidal thoughts.
 
Introducing the aspect of having one-on-one teaching experiences in VR with wellness coaches would add an aspect of emotional support and sense of social interaction for residents living in urban and especially rural environments.
 

 
A study published in Nature Neuroscience, “finds that social interactions can have a profound effect on behaviors related to addiction, and on the brain’s response to drug-associated cues. These findings have implications for people with substance use disorders (SUDs), because it suggests that social interaction can change the activity of specific neuronal circuits that control drug craving and relapse”.
Cited from https://www.drugabuse.gov/news-events/news-rele.... Accessed 24 Apr. 2020.
 
Rise Together VR experiences promotes social interaction to isolated individuals and offers a lifelike human teaching experience thanks to the immersive nature of virtual reality.
These experiences address essential mental health related subjects that people are facing due to social distancing such as how to cope with anxiety, overcoming fear, how to stay motivated as an entrepreneur and more.
 


 
Beams of Light virtual reality experiences uses a micro-learning teaching approach, meaning each lesson is under 10 minutes. This means Rise Together would allow you to avoid being overwhelmed with new information and absorb the information within the VR video experiences more easily.
 
By developing and housing the Rise Together video experiences into an easy to use VR application, people suffering from the constraints of lockdown can quickly leverage a dynamic set of wellness tools from the comfort of their home. Using a compact mobile VR device such as the Oculus GO VR headset requires no prior technical skills to get started.

<p> </p>
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>My name is Dr. Jeremy Miller and I am starting this campaign to create an environment that promotes healing, wellness, and vitality. As a doctor, health and wellness are of the utmost importance to me yet physicians and patients alike are bogged down in a system that doesn't promote health or wellness. I want to give people control over their health and access to science-based therapeutics to work towards curing their problem, not masking symptoms.</p>
<p>I am tired of hearing my patients tell me they have been in pain for decades. I am tired of people depending on a pill to get better when all they get is addicted. Using science, I have envisioned a health spa that promotes <strong><i>health and healing at the cellular level</i></strong>.</p>
<p>I find that most of my patients have <strong>TOO LITTLE</strong> nutrition, <strong>TOO MUCH</strong> inflammation, and an <strong>INABILITY</strong> for the body to use its normal metabolic processes to heal injured cells and tissue. This creates a cascade of worsening problems.</p>
<p>By using science-based therapeutics, Thrive is designed to enhance the bodies nutritional deficiencies through IV vitamin infusions, decrease inflammation with cryotherapy, and promote cellular growth with various low-light/cold-laser therapeutics.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we know its easier to keep people well then to fix them all over again. That is why this spa will promote continued wellness and preventative care so people can enjoy life more. THRIVE is designed with people in mind, not pocketbooks, and it is my hope that you will join me on this journey.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u>Why IV Vitamin Infusions</u></h3>
<p>It is estimated that 92% of the US population has a vitamin deficiency. Numerous factors contribute to this but two big reasons are the quality of our food and the quality of our soil. Fast food and junk food are staples of the American diet while fresh, nutrient-rich foods are considered time-consuming, expensive, and are seen as a luxury rather than a standard. </p>
<p>Multiple studies dating back to 1936 have shown that the soil of farmland across the globe is deficient in micronutrients. In 2003, a Canadian research team compared the nutritional data of current vegetables to data from 50 years ago and found that the mineral content had depleted from an average of 400 milligrams to less than 50 milligrams. </p>
<p>FACTS:</p>
<ul>
<li>90% of Adults are Vitamin D and/or Vitamin E deficient</li>
<li>60% are deficient in Magnesium</li>
<li>50% have a Vitamin A and/or a Calcium deficient</li>
<li>40% have a Vitamin C deficiency </li>
</ul>
<p>Being deficient in Vitamin D can result in obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, depression, fibromyalgia, fatigue, as well as contribute to diseases like Alzheimer's and can increase the chances of developing some cancers. <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3068797/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">It is an epidemic that is ignored.</a></p>
<p>Having vitamin deficiencies can affect your mood, your nervous system, your blood, your immune system, and so much more.</p>
<p>IV VITAMIN INFUSION BENEFITS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Near 100% vitamin absorption compared to a 50% absorption rate of oral vitamins</li>
<li>No nausea or GI irritation associated with oral vitamins</li>
<li>Energy boost</li>
<li>Increased metabolism</li>
<li>Improved mood and memory</li>
<li>Strengthened immune system</li>
<li>Enhanced cellular repair and wound healing</li>
<li>And so much more!!!</li>
</ul>
<p>We plan to offer 14 IV Infusion blends to meet a variety of health needs!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550876537/rn7mcgiaiur3vqfetawu.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><u>It's Hot to be Subzero!</u></h3>
<p>Developed in the 1970s and used in hospitals, athletic centers, and spas worldwide, immersive whole-body cryotherapy involves exposing the body to sub-zero temperatures for 2-3 mins to promote a plethora of healing effects. Cold air therapy in the whole body chamber is dry, fresh, oxygenated air so you won’t experience shivering, goosebumps or other reactions that you might associate with being cold. Because of this technology, unlike an ice bath or immersion therapy, whole body cryotherapy is not painful.</p>
<p>BENEFITS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased circulation and lymphatics</li>
<li>Improved collagen production</li>
<li>Reduced inflammation</li>
<li>Increased energy</li>
<li>Increased metabolism</li>
<li>Decreased pain</li>
<li>Flushes toxins</li>
<li>Improved joint and tissue range of motion</li>
</ul>
<p>Research has shown that whole-body cryotherapy <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21829501"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">reduces inflammation</a>, improves spinal pain/arthritis (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30684327"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here </a>and <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30402204"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>), can lead to <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30551730"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">better sleep,</a> <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30059565"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">improve cognitive function</a>, improves pain and quality of life in patients with fibromyalgia (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29458933"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here </a>and <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30353267"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>) and <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29161748"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">reduces muscle pain and improves muscle recovery.</a></p>

<h3>To the Future with Light, Laser, and PEMF</h3>
<p>Since 1960 and the discovery of lasers, light-therapy and other electromagnetic waves have been used to treat ailments of the body.  The use of light and EM waves to heal tissue, termed photobiomodulation, has over 4000 clinical studies published and has scientifically shown to be effective in treat nerve pain, muscle pain, promote tissue growth, and enhance wound healing. Photobiomodulation clinical has short, medium, and long-term effects which speeds<a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0116/2710/2265/files/The_Use_of_Low_Level_Light_Therapy_LLLT_For_Pain.pdf?14174392602906407978"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> up the body's ability to heal itself</a>. </p>
<p>FDA approved CELLUMA light therapy uses NASA technology and three types of light to enhance cellular reactions to increase collagen production, kill surface bacteria, increase circulation, decrease inflammation, and infuse compromised cells with added energy to enhance cellular performance and repair.</p>

<p>We are made up of nearly 100 TRILLION cells, and each cell is connected to the body's life force, the blood, via microvessels (capillaries). Microvessels makeup 74% of all the blood vessels in our bodies and if this vast network of microvessels were lined up in a straight line it would be 74,000 miles long. That is enough to wrap around the globe three times!</p>
<p>Impaired microcirculation can lead to a build-up of cellular waste and an inability to deliver fresh nutrients to the tissues as well as other vital components such as hormones and white blood cells. This can lead to inflammation, toxicity, and disease.</p>

<p>BEMER is the perfect companion to compliment and maximize benefits from IV nutritional infusions or whole body cryotherapy. It has hundreds of published research papers, including studies that support BEMER as a treatment option for <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26078768"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">relieving pain</a> and <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23940071"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">enhancing the quality of life</a>. </p>
<p>These are just a portion of the services Thrive plans to offer.  As we grow we plan to offer hormone replacement therapy, full spectrum blood panel testing, allergen testing, dietary and nutritional counseling, clean living coaching, and more. Our clinic will be supervised by a medical director and staffed by a team of nurses, therapists, and other professionals including a nurse practitioner, all of whom are dedicated to health, wellness, and vitality. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This project has been over 12 months in the making.  The hours I have put into it are countless and I am not alone. I have partnered with a small group of Tampa Bay doctors to work towards making this dream a reality. We have met with various commercial developers, vendors, manufacturers, and financers and we believe we are nearing the finish line. </p>
<p>Despite all of our hard work and preparation, we know that opening any business is a risky endeavor. Site-build out delays could happen, private investor financing could fall through, our vendors may not be able to meet deadlines, hiring and training new staff can be a challenge, and so forth. We do believe our business plan is solid and will guide us through this process.</p>
<p>I am linking <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/bp29t1n4fypx1om/Business%20Plana_watermarked.pdf?dl=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">a PDF overview of our original business plan proposal</a>. Some information is missing or redacted due to privacy concerns and trade secret protection but I want you to not only know we have a plan but to be able to see our plan and how much work we have put into this project. </p>
<p><i>DISCLAIMER: This business plan is not final and information such as pricing for our services may change. The information enclosed is the sole property of Jeremy Miller and all information is private and copyrighted.</i></p>
<p>MY PROMISE to all backers and supports is this: if we are unable to launch. I will refund your contributions 100%. I want people to believe in this project and do so risk-free. I promise to stay active during and after the campaign to provide updates and information.</p>

Furthermore, we know its easier to keep people well then to fix them all over again. That is why this spa will promote continued wellness and preventative care so people can enjoy life more. THRIVE is designed with people in mind, not pocketbooks, and it is my hope that you will join me on this journey.
 
Why IV Vitamin Infusions
It is estimated that 92% of the US population has a vitamin deficiency. Numerous factors contribute to this but two big reasons are the quality of our food and the quality of our soil. Fast food and junk food are staples of the American diet while fresh, nutrient-rich foods are considered time-consuming, expensive, and are seen as a luxury rather than a standard. 
Multiple studies dating back to 1936 have shown that the soil of farmland across the globe is deficient in micronutrients. In 2003, a Canadian research team compared the nutritional data of current vegetables to data from 50 years ago and found that the mineral content had depleted from an average of 400 milligrams to less than 50 milligrams. 
FACTS:

90% of Adults are Vitamin D and/or Vitamin E deficient
60% are deficient in Magnesium
50% have a Vitamin A and/or a Calcium deficient
40% have a Vitamin C deficiency 

Being deficient in Vitamin D can result in obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, depression, fibromyalgia, fatigue, as well as contribute to diseases like Alzheimer's and can increase the chances of developing some cancers. It is an epidemic that is ignored.
Having vitamin deficiencies can affect your mood, your nervous system, your blood, your immune system, and so much more.
IV VITAMIN INFUSION BENEFITS:

Near 100% vitamin absorption compared to a 50% absorption rate of oral vitamins
No nausea or GI irritation associated with oral vitamins
Energy boost
Increased metabolism
Improved mood and memory
Strengthened immune system
Enhanced cellular repair and wound healing
And so much more!!!

We plan to offer 14 IV Infusion blends to meet a variety of health needs!

It's Hot to be Subzero!
Developed in the 1970s and used in hospitals, athletic centers, and spas worldwide, immersive whole-body cryotherapy involves exposing the body to sub-zero temperatures for 2-3 mins to promote a plethora of healing effects. Cold air therapy in the whole body chamber is dry, fresh, oxygenated air so you won’t experience shivering, goosebumps or other reactions that you might associate with being cold. Because of this technology, unlike an ice bath or immersion therapy, whole body cryotherapy is not painful.
BENEFITS:

Increased circulation and lymphatics
Improved collagen production
Reduced inflammation
Increased energy
Increased metabolism
Decreased pain
Flushes toxins
Improved joint and tissue range of motion

Research has shown that whole-body cryotherapy reduces inflammation, improves spinal pain/arthritis (here and here), can lead to better sleep, improve cognitive function, improves pain and quality of life in patients with fibromyalgia (here and here) and reduces muscle pain and improves muscle recovery.
We are partnering with US Cryotherapy to bring the latest and safest cryotherapy to the Tampa region.

 

 
 
To the Future with Light, Laser, and PEMF
Since 1960 and the discovery of lasers, light-therapy and other electromagnetic waves have been used to treat ailments of the body.  The use of light and EM waves to heal tissue, termed photobiomodulation, has over 4000 clinical studies published and has scientifically shown to be effective in treat nerve pain, muscle pain, promote tissue growth, and enhance wound healing. Photobiomodulation clinical has short, medium, and long-term effects which speeds up the body's ability to heal itself. 
FDA approved CELLUMA light therapy uses NASA technology and three types of light to enhance cellular reactions to increase collagen production, kill surface bacteria, increase circulation, decrease inflammation, and infuse compromised cells with added energy to enhance cellular performance and repair.
 


We are made up of nearly 100 TRILLION cells, and each cell is connected to the body's life force, the blood, via microvessels (capillaries). Microvessels makeup 74% of all the blood vessels in our bodies and if this vast network of microvessels were lined up in a straight line it would be 74,000 miles long. That is enough to wrap around the globe three times!
Impaired microcirculation can lead to a build-up of cellular waste and an inability to deliver fresh nutrients to the tissues as well as other vital components such as hormones and white blood cells. This can lead to inflammation, toxicity, and disease.


 

 
BEMER is the perfect companion to compliment and maximize benefits from IV nutritional infusions or whole body cryotherapy. It has hundreds of published research papers, including studies that support BEMER as a treatment option for relieving pain and enhancing the quality of life. 
These are just a portion of the services Thrive plans to offer.  As we grow we plan to offer hormone replacement therapy, full spectrum blood panel testing, allergen testing, dietary and nutritional counseling, clean living coaching, and more. Our clinic will be supervised by a medical director and staffed by a team of nurses, therapists, and other professionals including a nurse practitioner, all of whom are dedicated to health, wellness, and vitality. 
 
Mock Floor Plan 2800 sqft


The Where
We are currently planning on opening in Pinellas County in the new Seminole City Center location. Secondary and tertiary locations are also being considered. 
Pinellas County has the highest density of any county in Florida and boasts a population nearing 1 million. Seminole City Center is a new, upscale development that is already busy with shoppers and includes businesses promoting health and wellness such as Earth Fare Grocery Store, LA Fitness, a chiropractic office, and a massage center. Seminole is home to the Bay Pines Veteran Hospital with over 100,000 patient visits annually. Seminole is home to hundreds of businesses dedicated to senior health. This location is also easily accessible to the rest of Pinellas County.

450K+ people within an estimated 20-minute drive
The immediate area features approximately 90K people with a college degree and 70K+ households with over $50K in income
80,000 vehicles per day pass by
36k estimated tourist population annual in the area

 

Risks & Challenges
This project has been over 12 months in the making.  The hours I have put into it are countless and I am not alone. I have partnered with a small group of Tampa Bay doctors to work towards making this dream a reality. We have met with various commercial developers, vendors, manufacturers, and financers and we believe we are nearing the finish line. 
Despite all of our hard work and preparation, we know that opening any business is a risky endeavor. Site-build out delays could happen, private investor financing could fall through, our vendors may not be able to meet deadlines, hiring and training new staff can be a challenge, and so forth. We do believe our business plan is solid and will guide us through this process.
I am linking a PDF overview of our original business plan proposal. Some information is missing or redacted due to privacy concerns and trade secret protection but I want you to not only know we have a plan but to be able to see our plan and how much work we have put into this project. 
DISCLAIMER: This business plan is not final and information such as pricing for our services may change. The information enclosed is the sole property of Jeremy Miller and all information is private and copyrighted.
MY PROMISE to all backers and supports is this: if we are unable to launch. I will refund your contributions 100%. I want people to believe in this project and do so risk-free. I promise to stay active during and after the campaign to provide updates and information.

We will have 4 full swing golf sims and 4 driving range sims. We will also have a pro shop, an indoor putting green, and a bar serving beer and wine. We are still working out the food details but there will also be food and beverages. Ever wanted to play golf at night? How about when it's raining outside or too cold or too hot? Don't want to miss the game to play a round? Don't have 4-5 hours to play golf? Tired of losing $5 golf balls and hunting for your ball all day long? I have the answers to all of these issues with golf. We are open at night. The weather is always great inside. We have TV's playing the sports you want to watch. 1 person can play golf in about 45 minutes on the simulators. If you can't find your ball here, golf may not be for you. Mahony's Indoor Golf solves all of the problems that cause people to not play enough golf. We are not competing with golf courses, we are providing a place to play golf for when getting to the golf course isn't possible.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>We need seed money while we wait for the financing to go through. The current plan is to open sometime between November 2016 and February 2017. We are looking for seed money to start advertising and buying merchandise.<br/><br/>The rewards for donations are just what they say. I am selling simulator time on the golf simulators and merchandise ahead of time at a discounted price. All gift cards will be available at the store once we open for anyone that purchases them. Just bring ID to show who you are and you will receive your reward. Financing has already been approved for the store, however we are still looking at the possibility of an investor, with a few potentials in mind. With that said, if for some reason, the store does not open, We will refund the money donated back to each individual except for the 1 dollar donations.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>The challenge for us right now is getting a suitable building in a location that will work. The rent has not been the issue, finding something that we want has been. We are confident that we will have a building within the next couple of months so I can update this part and eliminate any concerns about that.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>If you are unable to donate, please share this post. Even if I don't get a dime, getting the word out to everyone about this company is the #1 goal. It will open with or without donations, this is being used to generate buzz and get a head start on the tasks at hand. If this just turns out to be great advertising, then half the battle has already been won. Thank you.<br/>

<strong>Кратка история</strong> </h3>
<p>Казвам се Александър Сръндев, на 20 години от София. Национален състезател съм по триатлон и лека атлетика от 2012 година. Имам редица международни състезания зад гърба си.</p>
<div> </div>
<p>В момента главна цел ми е да мотивирам възможно повече подрастващите в България за по-активен начин на живот.<br/><br/>Имам редица международни състезания зад гърба си. Държа титли като държавен, балкански,</p>
<div> </div>
<p>двоен вицеевропейски шампион (младежи - 2016г. и мъже до 23г. - 2017г.) , както и 33-то място при младежи на световното първенство по планинско бягане през 2016г. <br/>Стремя се да мотивирам подрастващите за по-активен начин на живот.<br/>Главна цел ми е участие и добър резултат на Олимпийските игри в Токио 2020 година.</p>
<p>В последните години доказах на себе си и хората около мен, че съм достатъчно талантлив и трудолюбив, за да успея да взема участие на олимпиада някой ден. </p>
<p>От началото на 2018 година всички състезатели по триатлон от целия свят ще се впуснат в 3 годишна борба за точки от световни купи, серии и първенства. Аз имам реални шансове за влизане в ранглистата и взимане на квота за Олимпиадата до лятото на 2020 година. </p>
<p>От 2 години насам Българска Федерация по Триатлон не получава финансиране, за да може да подготви най-добрите български атлети и те да имат равен шанс като всички останали състезатели от другите страни, да премерят сили един срещу друг. За жалост първенствата, от които може да се вземат нужните точки са разпръснати из целия свят и е невъзможно без финансова подкрепа да се участва на тях!</p>
<p>Този проект ще бъде реализиран единствено и само, чрез намиране на финансиране. Треньорите ми помагат максимално и са ме издигнали на световно ниво, но въпреки това трябва да се наеме още екип, който да ме следи постоянно.</p>
<p>Интересен факт е, че българин до сега не е взимал участие в олимпийските игри и ако аз успея ще пренапиша историята!</p>

<p>We live in a
world where time is money. We commit ourselves to projects for which we spend
time in order to be effective, thus we see ourselves compelled to simplify some
things. This is how the idea of developing the watch concept emerged, a watch designed
to facilitate our access to information or to elements of interest, aiming to
satisfy our desire for convenience. It is an accessory easy to wear, polyvalent
and which may provide us all the benefits of technology that, once we could enjoy
only within an office. </p>

<p>We need technology, we need the dialogue, but we also
need that these may take place whenever, wherever and more important, easily.

go to work, for jogging, to a pub or to a fancy party, to take an exam or
merely go on a vacation.
                         MATCH YOUR DISPLAY
                                             by a single gesture


What’s your
mood? Are you today in a mood for something classic, heavy, discrete or soft?
You may choose the theme and you can enjoy the new look perfectly adjusted to
your mood or wish.



If you do not
want to blend in with the other persons and you want to be different and to
live your life just as you wish and imagine, we have especially designed Ego Desert
Rose model. This is a limited edition product. 
             HOW DID IT START?    
                      When you have a dream, dare to accomplish it! 





We live in a
world where time is money. We commit ourselves to projects for which we spend
time in order to be effective, thus we see ourselves compelled to simplify some
things. This is how the idea of developing the watch concept emerged, a watch designed
to facilitate our access to information or to elements of interest, aiming to
satisfy our desire for convenience. It is an accessory easy to wear, polyvalent
and which may provide us all the benefits of technology that, once we could enjoy
only within an office. 


We need technology, we need the dialogue, but we also
need that these may take place whenever, wherever and more important, easily.
You may receive emails, messages, check your agenda or even answer your calls
on the street, on the metro or behind the wheel, on your way home. 













          
        PERFECT COMPATIBILITY
                                                               with your phone






          We care about
our health condition, we are more than eager to improve it, to monitor it and
Ego smart watch takes care to collect all the data of interest and to provide
you the essential information on its own display or even directly on your cell phone.
















Ego synchronises
with the notifications of the applications set up on your cell phone. Thus, you
may find on time the news, what have your friends been doing lately or even get
an invitation to an event, you may have conversations or share in real time
pictures, movies on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp and on the other
social networks. 













This function will help you anytime to quickly find
your lost phone. You also have the possibility of setting your smart watch to
inform you whenever you will move away for more than 10 m of your smart phone. 







Ego thought
of all those who love and wish to keep alive their memories from holidays,
special moments spent with friends or family. It is simple, convenient and no
longer necessary to run in order to be a part of the picture, without missing a
picture! No need to stretch your arms in order to take a picture. 




Fitted with
Bluetooth connection, Ego ensures you the comfort of having everything under
control without having to use all the communication devices. 




We understood
that your desire is to have a resistant watch, which may be worn anytime and
anywhere. We took into account the active lifestyle and the need of
independence. The battery life lasts even for 9 days, with a display conceived
according to the latest technology and with delicate lines that ensure it a
posh design, Ego makes you live a unique experience.



                                              DETAIL-ORIENTED
Ego was
designed to have an ergonomic shape, a small quantity, a friendly design in
order to be more comfortable and easy to use. With a case and its whole frame
made of stainless steel, non-allergic, resistant to any environmental factors,
Ego smart watch is a long-lasting, strong and indestructible watch. 
We are aware that people love to have the freedom of
choosing. Ego did not neglect your wish!
By its
metallic and leather straps, Ego may anytime change its look. You have the
possibility of adopting a fancy style with the metallic straps or a casual look
when choosing the leather straps. You may also adjust the theme of the display
as you consider it best suits you and you will definitely smile all day long!

<div><b>Why are we the right people to make this idea happen?</b></div>
<div><b>This is probably most important question you can ask and the answer is simple: passion. Often times in life it is the people with the most passion for a project or issue that are the most successful. They are willing to put the most of themselves into it because it is such a big part of them. And passion for this project is something we have in spades.</b></div>

<b>This is my son Owen whom this epic food fight is named after. When he was born he had to have part of his intestine removed which caused him to be diagnosed with short bowel syndrome. In the years since he was diagnosed we have been in contact with countless medical professionals. What we have learned is that research for pediatric GI conditions are underfunded. That was when we began to look for an idea that could raise awareness for these conditions and funds for research. And then one day, while feeding Owen, it came to me. A food fight! It's fun and has meaning.</b>

<p>We will be actively looking for partners to help make our event as fun as possible for the participants</p>

<p><b>Craft Beer Producers</b>: What does someone want after they were just in an epic culinary battle? A cold beer. We plan to include one beer in with the event ticket as well. If you are interested please email us at OwensFoodFight@gmail.com</p>

<p><b>DJs/Musicians</b>: Have you ever heard of an epic battle that didn't have a soundtrack? Of course not. We are looking for DJs and live bands to play both during the fight and at the after party. If you are interested please email us at OwensFoodFight@gmail.com</p>

<h1>Charity</h1>
<p>The driver behind this project and the reason we started it in the first place is to help children like our son. GI conditions do not get nearly as much attention as many other diseases even if they are just as life altering and threatening. This is why our primary mission, after making sure you have fun, is to try and make a difference. The way we plan to do that, at first, is to donate at least 50% of our profits to pediatric GI research at the nations top children's hospitals. And that is the bare minimum that we plan to donate. The actual amount will probably be much high but we cannot predict the exact amount until we know all of our costs. With the additional funds we hope that they will be able to help more children live full and happy lives. Along with donating profits from ticket sales, we will also have fundraising at the events as well with activities that have yet TBD. <br/><br/>So please, help us make this a reality. Not only will you have a great time at an EPIC food fight, you will also help children in their greatest time of need.</p>

Our Story
Why are we the right people to make this idea happen?
This is probably most important question you can ask and the answer is simple: passion. Often times in life it is the people with the most passion for a project or issue that are the most successful. They are willing to put the most of themselves into it because it is such a big part of them. And passion for this project is something we have in spades.


This is my son Owen whom this epic food fight is named after. When he was born he had to have part of his intestine removed which caused him to be diagnosed with short bowel syndrome. In the years since he was diagnosed we have been in contact with countless medical professionals. What we have learned is that research for pediatric GI conditions are underfunded. That was when we began to look for an idea that could raise awareness for these conditions and funds for research. And then one day, while feeding Owen, it came to me. A food fight! It's fun and has meaning.



And it because of that passion that we would be the most ideal team to run this campaign and make this project a reality.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Possible setbacks:
Finding a venue might prove to be difficult due to the nature of the event but difficult is not impossible. There will be venues that will want to host this epic event.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Partnerships
We will be actively looking for partners to help make our event as fun as possible for the participants
Caterers and/or Food Trucks: While there will be plenty of food in the fight it is only going to make them hungrier. If you are interested please email us at OwensFoodFight@gmail.com
Craft Beer Producers: What does someone want after they were just in an epic culinary battle? A cold beer. We plan to include one beer in with the event ticket as well. If you are interested please email us at OwensFoodFight@gmail.com
Photographers/Videographers: Pictures or it didn't happen, right? Well it is pretty difficult to snap a picture while you are hurling handfuls of mashed potatoes at your enemy. That's where you come in. If you are interested please email us at OwensFoodFight@gmail.com
DJs/Musicians: Have you ever heard of an epic battle that didn't have a soundtrack? Of course not. We are looking for DJs and live bands to play both during the fight and at the after party. If you are interested please email us at OwensFoodFight@gmail.com
Vendors: Have something that you think our food warriors would like to procure after a days battle? Please contact us at OwensFoodFight@gmail.com

Sponsors

If your company would like to join us as an official sponsor please contact us at OwensFoodFight@gmail.com
There will several levels of sponsorship and any contribution you would like to make would be highly appreciated.

Charity
The driver behind this project and the reason we started it in the first place is to help children like our son. GI conditions do not get nearly as much attention as many other diseases even if they are just as life altering and threatening. This is why our primary mission, after making sure you have fun, is to try and make a difference. The way we plan to do that, at first, is to donate at least 50% of our profits to pediatric GI research at the nations top children's hospitals. And that is the bare minimum that we plan to donate. The actual amount will probably be much high but we cannot predict the exact amount until we know all of our costs. With the additional funds we hope that they will be able to help more children live full and happy lives. Along with donating profits from ticket sales, we will also have fundraising at the events as well with activities that have yet TBD. So please, help us make this a reality. Not only will you have a great time at an EPIC food fight, you will also help children in their greatest time of need.

<h3>Why Develop A Child/Pet Car Device?</h3>
<p>It seems unfathomable that children and pets could be left alone in cars long enough to die. Yet it has happened time and again. This brings up two pertinent questions:<br/></p>
<p><b>Why VIKIE?</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>740+ kids have died since 2011</li>
<li>4 kids have died in 2016 months before summer temperatures begin</li>
<li>46 K-9s have died since 2011</li>
<li>Unknown and/or unreported number of pets<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>And what can VIKIE do?</b><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Will detect small kids and pets</li>
<li>Will monitor detected small kids and pets</li>
<li>Will alert others until saved; if not will contact 911<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, VIKIE does not judge. VIKIE does not care how or why a kid or pet is alone. VIKIE only cares about saving kids and pets. VIKIE will simply do its job which is to detect, monitor, and begin alerts upon dangerous temperatures and/or time alone (and other proprietary factors). If VIKIE's alerts do not cause passersby or the driver to respond in a timely manner, VIKIE will send GPS coordinates and a VIKIE message to 911.  <br/></p>
<p>As aforementioned, VIKIE will prevent or completely eliminate kids/pets/K-9s from dying in hot-cars (or cold for that matter). VIKIE is <b>not a stop-gap or a gadget alarm system</b>. VIKIE is a fully autonomous, integrated, and embedded system. VIKIE is completely unseen by all. In other words, if a child/pet is never alone and/or in distress, you would never know VIKIE was even installed and active. The same can be said for an airbag. You don't really know it's there unless it is deployed. <br/></p>
<p>VIKIE works silently in the background detecting, monitoring, and alerting when/if necessary. The driver has nothing to do but operate the vehicle as normal. It is a really innovative and great system.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The following :14 second video shows a few of VIKIE's simulated alarms after a  child has been detected. This doesn't even scratch the surface; there are a quite a few more things VIKIE does as well.</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DyNWgHpZZ8g8%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FyNWgHpZZ8g8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p> </div> <div> <h3>
</h3>
<h3>So, Whats Next For VIKIE? Where To From Here?</h3>
<p>The prototype shown throughout is ready for tooling and further industrial design. Derek has taken the prototype as far as he can with current financials. Once the project is funded, we may or may not need to hand the prototype over to an industrial design team. First order of business once funded is to utilize the AT&amp;T Foundry (Atlanta, GA). They do great things and may assist in taking the prototype to the next level. Derek and Justin will seemingly live there and work closely with them and guide them through all of VIKIE's intricate details and needs. The same can be said for using an industrial design team as well. These steps (design &amp; tooling) are intended for the proof-of-concept vehicle. They may finalize the industrial design &amp; tooling steps noted in the attached timeline below. However, if they do not, they will simply have taken first steps towards completion of such and the timeline of design and tooling will remain intact.<br/></p>
<p>Justin will keep different phases on schedule. Additional coding for different vehicles will be handled by Derek and all should be debugged and refined in 4 - 8 weeks. Once coding and hardware are finished, Derek will work closely with an automotive engineer to wire up the vehicle(s).<br/></p>
<p>Once the initial vehicle(s) are wired, NHTSA testing will be scheduled. We are confident we will achieve and receive a resounding and favorable report from NHTSA, which in turn will satisfy a new federal mandated bill (Dec. 2015) to research a hot-car solution.</p>
<p>Upon completion of NHTSA/Government approval, manufacturing will commence. Derek and Anthony will then market and reach out to various auto makers and other auto parts' makers to get VIKIE in vehicles to save kids, pets, and K-9s.<br/></p>

VIKIE needs to raise $100,000 to accomplish the next two phases in sequence: <br/><ul>
<li>Proof-of-concept vehicle(s) for NHTSA testing</li>
<li>Initial manufacturing/marketing for first line of kid/pet/K-9 saving vehicles</li>
</ul>
<p>If VIKIE does not accomplish the entire crowdfunding goal, funds 
raised can still go towards parts, tools, and other equipment that will 
lose no value whatsoever while awaiting further funds in the near 
future.</p>

</ul>
<h4>What Perks Are Offered? Cost?</h4>To begin, every single backer should understand that the most important perk of all is the <b>innocent</b> <b>child/pet/K-9 life-saving mission</b> we are all set forth to accomplish! <br/><br/>That being said every backer will be listed (if so desired) on VIKIE's soon-to-be created <i>""<b>Wall of Supporters.""</b></i><b> </b>This wall will remain a part of VIKIE forever and become VIKIE lore. When VIKIE becomes ubiquitous like the seat belt &amp; airbag or when all cars are flying around like ""The Jetsons"" with mandatory VIKIEs installed, VIKIE's wall will have it's place in history and be cemented with all that supported it. On this wall will be stated <b>""&lt;yourName&gt; gave to save a kid and pet's life. &lt;yourName&gt; helped make VIKIE happen!"" </b>Derek will assure this database (backups, encryption, etc.) of supporters lasts and honors every single supporter. This mission is just too important and credit will be given accordingly. It will be an honor to have contributed to saving a life. And we will all feel a great relief when we no longer hear about a kid or pet suffering or figuratively and literally ""baking"" in a car.<br/><br/><h4>Perks:</h4>

<h3>Shipping</h3>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: Shipping for some backers will occur in Sep. 2016 wherein for others it will occur in Jan. 2017. The perk you choose will provide you with the estimated delivery date.<br/></p>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>What Is VIKIE's Impact? What Is My Impact?<br/>
</h3> <p>VIKIE is not the normal flashy new invention and recall VIKIE will not even be seen. Aesthetics and new-gadget-flash aside, know this about VIKIE's impact: <b>VIKIE Saves Kids! VIKIE Saves Pets! VIKIE Saves Lives! </b>This project is uber-important. VIKIE has to rank in the upper echelons of all projects and/or inventions. Okay we are a little biased. However, VIKIE will be used to save a 2-year old from dying due to hyperthermia. VIKIE will save that loving pet panting in the backseat helplessly with no recourse. That 4-year old that might can open the door but was told to stay in the car banging at the window while literally burning up will also be helped by VIKIE. These are HORRIFIC events to discuss! However, these types of occurrences happen some <b>37+ times every year</b>. And that's what backing VIKIE will impact. It will impact the number of kid/pets/K-9s hot-car deaths each year, until hopefully that number is 0! <br/></p>
<p>Rest assured <b>your impact of backing VIKIE will be felt in society and globally</b>. This happens in the U.S. and overseas as well. Biased or not, VIKIE is a top-notch system and helping VIKIE to become realized will leave a pleasant feeling to any supporter. The fact that by summer of 2017, VIKIE can be live in multiple vehicle lines is heart-pounding; which is much better than our stomach cringing in knots as our ears hear of 4 kids dying already this year alone - well before summer temperatures. And unfortunately, possibly more to come!<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>VIKIE is new and our CTO has went to great lengths to make the prototype-to-demo ""easy peasy."" However, manufacturing and production delays and other snafus may arise.  Due to these various scenarios, VIKIE will procure assistance from an industrial team or at the very least an experienced automotive engineer. <br/><br/>Once funding has been met, information will be available of VIKIE's status on <a href=""http://www.social.vikie.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.social.vikie.net</a> to keep all backers in the loop.
</div>
<br/>In addition, VIKIE is not shying away from improvement. Recall the first step is to schedule NHTSA testing. NHTSA runs extensive testing and does not simply hand out high ratings. Once VIKIE succeeds in becoming NHTSA approved, the standard for VIKIE and its life-saving system will be set and future challenges will be lessened greatly. </div> <div> <h3></h3>

<h3>How Can I Help? How Can I Help Save Kids &amp; Pets? <br/>

What is not always apparent is the number of children that have died. Since 1991, 740+ kids have died due to hot-vehicle heatstrokes. 740 and climbing! Tragically and extremely unfortunately, three have been confirmed in 2016 (Jan 2016 in GA and Apr 2016 in Texas and Kentucky) well before the summer of 2016 and the normal summer-temperatures that ensue (scroll-to-US-map-and-click-dots-in-GA-and-TX-and-KY-for-reports).
We at VIKIE are passionate about solving this nationwide dilemma. We have a patent-pending solution that will prevent and/or eliminate these tragic events in the near future and from here on out.
However, to further VIKIE and save kids and pets, we need funding assistance. This project has been ongoing and patent-pending since 2014. It has been personally funded by my team and myself. Funds have been completely exhausted. With your help, we can finish development which entails taking the VIKIE prototype to a live proof-of-concept vehicle(s). This vehicle will subsequently be scheduled for NHTSA testing to demonstrate to the government and the auto industry a viable and rock-solid solution to this problem. Together we can save these small kids' and pets' lives. 





Why Develop A Child/Pet Car Device?
It seems unfathomable that children and pets could be left alone in cars long enough to die. Yet it has happened time and again. This brings up two pertinent questions:
Why VIKIE?


740+ kids have died since 2011
4 kids have died in 2016 months before summer temperatures begin
46 K-9s have died since 2011
Unknown and/or unreported number of pets


And what can VIKIE do?

Will detect small kids and pets
Will monitor detected small kids and pets
Will alert others until saved; if not will contact 911


Also, VIKIE does not judge. VIKIE does not care how or why a kid or pet is alone. VIKIE only cares about saving kids and pets. VIKIE will simply do its job which is to detect, monitor, and begin alerts upon dangerous temperatures and/or time alone (and other proprietary factors). If VIKIE's alerts do not cause passersby or the driver to respond in a timely manner, VIKIE will send GPS coordinates and a VIKIE message to 911.  
As aforementioned, VIKIE will prevent or completely eliminate kids/pets/K-9s from dying in hot-cars (or cold for that matter). VIKIE is not a stop-gap or a gadget alarm system. VIKIE is a fully autonomous, integrated, and embedded system. VIKIE is completely unseen by all. In other words, if a child/pet is never alone and/or in distress, you would never know VIKIE was even installed and active. The same can be said for an airbag. You don't really know it's there unless it is deployed. 
VIKIE works silently in the background detecting, monitoring, and alerting when/if necessary. The driver has nothing to do but operate the vehicle as normal. It is a really innovative and great system.

The following :14 second video shows a few of VIKIE's simulated alarms after a  child has been detected. This doesn't even scratch the surface; there are a quite a few more things VIKIE does as well.
   

So, Whats Next For VIKIE? Where To From Here?
The prototype shown throughout is ready for tooling and further industrial design. Derek has taken the prototype as far as he can with current financials. Once the project is funded, we may or may not need to hand the prototype over to an industrial design team. First order of business once funded is to utilize the AT&T Foundry (Atlanta, GA). They do great things and may assist in taking the prototype to the next level. Derek and Justin will seemingly live there and work closely with them and guide them through all of VIKIE's intricate details and needs. The same can be said for using an industrial design team as well. These steps (design & tooling) are intended for the proof-of-concept vehicle. They may finalize the industrial design & tooling steps noted in the attached timeline below. However, if they do not, they will simply have taken first steps towards completion of such and the timeline of design and tooling will remain intact.
Justin will keep different phases on schedule. Additional coding for different vehicles will be handled by Derek and all should be debugged and refined in 4 - 8 weeks. Once coding and hardware are finished, Derek will work closely with an automotive engineer to wire up the vehicle(s).
Once the initial vehicle(s) are wired, NHTSA testing will be scheduled. We are confident we will achieve and receive a resounding and favorable report from NHTSA, which in turn will satisfy a new federal mandated bill (Dec. 2015) to research a hot-car solution.
Upon completion of NHTSA/Government approval, manufacturing will commence. Derek and Anthony will then market and reach out to various auto makers and other auto parts' makers to get VIKIE in vehicles to save kids, pets, and K-9s.










Funding
Where Will The Money Go?

 



VIKIE needs to raise $100,000 to accomplish the next two phases in sequence: 
Proof-of-concept vehicle(s) for NHTSA testing
Initial manufacturing/marketing for first line of kid/pet/K-9 saving vehicles

If VIKIE does not accomplish the entire crowdfunding goal, funds 
raised can still go towards parts, tools, and other equipment that will 
lose no value whatsoever while awaiting further funds in the near 
future.


What Perks Are Offered? Cost?To begin, every single backer should understand that the most important perk of all is the innocent child/pet/K-9 life-saving mission we are all set forth to accomplish! That being said every backer will be listed (if so desired) on VIKIE's soon-to-be created ""Wall of Supporters."" This wall will remain a part of VIKIE forever and become VIKIE lore. When VIKIE becomes ubiquitous like the seat belt & airbag or when all cars are flying around like ""The Jetsons"" with mandatory VIKIEs installed, VIKIE's wall will have it's place in history and be cemented with all that supported it. On this wall will be stated ""<yourName> gave to save a kid and pet's life. <yourName> helped make VIKIE happen!"" Derek will assure this database (backups, encryption, etc.) of supporters lasts and honors every single supporter. This mission is just too important and credit will be given accordingly. It will be an honor to have contributed to saving a life. And we will all feel a great relief when we no longer hear about a kid or pet suffering or figuratively and literally ""baking"" in a car.Perks:

   What Is VIKIE's Impact? What Is My Impact?
 VIKIE is not the normal flashy new invention and recall VIKIE will not even be seen. Aesthetics and new-gadget-flash aside, know this about VIKIE's impact: VIKIE Saves Kids! VIKIE Saves Pets! VIKIE Saves Lives! This project is uber-important. VIKIE has to rank in the upper echelons of all projects and/or inventions. Okay we are a little biased. However, VIKIE will be used to save a 2-year old from dying due to hyperthermia. VIKIE will save that loving pet panting in the backseat helplessly with no recourse. That 4-year old that might can open the door but was told to stay in the car banging at the window while literally burning up will also be helped by VIKIE. These are HORRIFIC events to discuss! However, these types of occurrences happen some 37+ times every year. And that's what backing VIKIE will impact. It will impact the number of kid/pets/K-9s hot-car deaths each year, until hopefully that number is 0! 
Rest assured your impact of backing VIKIE will be felt in society and globally. This happens in the U.S. and overseas as well. Biased or not, VIKIE is a top-notch system and helping VIKIE to become realized will leave a pleasant feeling to any supporter. The fact that by summer of 2017, VIKIE can be live in multiple vehicle lines is heart-pounding; which is much better than our stomach cringing in knots as our ears hear of 4 kids dying already this year alone - well before summer temperatures. And unfortunately, possibly more to come!
  Risks & Challenges
VIKIE is new and our CTO has went to great lengths to make the prototype-to-demo ""easy peasy."" However, manufacturing and production delays and other snafus may arise.  Due to these various scenarios, VIKIE will procure assistance from an industrial team or at the very least an experienced automotive engineer. Once funding has been met, information will be available of VIKIE's status on www.social.vikie.net to keep all backers in the loop.

In addition, VIKIE is not shying away from improvement. Recall the first step is to schedule NHTSA testing. NHTSA runs extensive testing and does not simply hand out high ratings. Once VIKIE succeeds in becoming NHTSA approved, the standard for VIKIE and its life-saving system will be set and future challenges will be lessened greatly.   

How Can I Help? How Can I Help Save Kids & Pets? 

The best way to help VIKIE is to fund/back us. In backing VIKIE, you are actually helping to save a life!

If you cannot help fund us, but are passionate about VIKIE and it's societal impact worldwide, please share this campaign with friends, family, and others. Every contribution or word-of-mouth helps.",7.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Hi! My name is And Vatika, I am 36 years old, from Buenos Aires, Argentina. I am a Yoga and Ayurveda teacher, been working with these amazing philosophies for more than 15 years now. After a few trips to India, I've realized I had a message to pass on.</h3>
<p>I've always wanted to make a book on Ayurveda, because in this lifestyle I've found healing and plenty of answers. So I thought about sharing them with the world, in a broader way than what I had been doing (teaching classes and workshops to 10/20 people each time).</p>
<p>And so I did: all the love, energy, time, (and money) I put into the book project gave great results: it came out beautiful, people gave me empowering loving feedbacks, and it was a success in Argentina and Uruguay. </p>
<p>But that was only a Spanish version of my message to the world. Now I want to reach all the people who don't speak Spanish, and probably speak English. And I need your help. Your help will make my dream not only become real, but also multicultural.</p>

<p>I need $2000 to translate the book (190 pages) into English, edit and correct it, and hire an e-book designer to create the e-book edition of the book (it exists in a printed version).</p>
<p>In Argentina, I used a local crown founding site to raise money for the last part (printing of the book) and the project reached the goal in the first weeks.

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Have you ever got up on the wrong side of the bed and felt like your whole day has been ruined? <br/>You are not alone. <br/>Your mood in the morning will definitely affect your entire day.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;font-size: 60px;"">Hey there!</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">My name is Renato and I am the founder of Sugr.</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523719878/pdpbtz8bx9raxvskya4f.jpg"" src="""" style=""width:200px;height:200px;border-radius:50%;""/></p>
<p>The simple idea of kickstarting your day by experiencing something positive is based on a good amount of human-psychology research. It is clearly shown that morning mood has significant effect on the rest of the day. The task is easy - experience something positive right after you wake up.</p>
<p><strong>What on Earth could be such a positive experience in the morning?</strong> There is not much fun associated with getting up, right?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529410301/s1a2moy801g9q8agozau.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""font-size:60px;""> </p>
<p>Well, if you imagine the situation of walking by the street and having someone compliment you on your hairstyle, jacket or whatever it is, you can easily see why I have chosen compliments. These little experiences boost happiness. Why is complimenting so rare then?</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Why?</strong></h3>
<p>We are usually too shy to express our feelings or generally give our opinion out. We prefer to stay in our safe spot, called the comfort zone. There is nothing wrong about it, this is general human nature.</p>
<p>When I first started imagining Sugr, I immediately knew it has to be <strong>anonymous</strong>. This removes the barrier of leaving the comfort zone and makes complimenting others as easy as pressing a button, without giving out identity.</p>
<p>In Sugr you receive your compliments in the morning, so <strong>you can start every day by reading what other people like about you.</strong> This is an extremely good feeling and a great motivator.</p>
<p><strong>But there is more to this story.</strong> In Sugr the number of compliments you get is only determined by the number of compliments you send to others. This spiral of positive energy can realistically make the world a better, happier and even more beautiful place. <br/><strong>This is my dream.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;font-size:40px;"">So what can you do with Sugr?</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">I have kept it simple and only focused on the most important part. That is to deliver the experience as easily as possible.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Get compliments</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528657682/uknzkg3j5mmygpbw5bz8.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528906308/g6kmc6dzmldnzfylwoo8.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Get compliments from people all over the</strong><strong> </strong><strong>world.</strong> Let's be fair - to get compliments, you also have to send some. In Sugr the number of compliments you receive is solely based on the number of compliments you send. Your received compliments are delivered to you every morning. This way you can start every day with discovering what people like about you.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Only positive</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528906291/ktfa0csaaygdtdplw3zm.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Every message is analyzed. Messages that contain <strong>offensive context will not be delivered.</strong> The Sugr is built upon a sophisticated fraud prevention algorithm. The system flags every suspicious compliment and prevents them from being delivered. These compliments are then being inspected by human eyes. If the message is obviously offensive, it gets deleted, while the user associated with the message gets terminated immediately.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Chat</strong></h3>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528905985/jyuespu164mtdbytyazb.png"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>Start chatting with people you get compliments from. This is a great way to say thanks. </p>
<h3><strong>4. Anonymous</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528906276/olnbp4ewyr5aq91l4ixk.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Every compliment is anonymous by default.  This means that you appear as ""Anonymous"" with your blurred main picture to the receivers of your compliment  by default. You can <strong>ask others to reveal themselves</strong> or you can reveal yourself if you get requested. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 40px;text-align: center;"">Let's talk about business</h2>
</div>
<div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Money is important, but…</strong></h3> <p>Sugr is a self funded project and <strong>will be launched almost certainly.</strong></p>
<p>The money raised through Indiegogo is directly helping to reach more people than I could afford by myself. <strong>This is everyone's interest.</strong> The more people are using the application, the more compliments there are to receive. Remember: The aim is to reach as much people as possible to make Sugr an extraordinary user experience.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529390999/qc80hd2gwbeimcbrlci1.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The most important goal of this campaign therefore is to <strong>build a community</strong> and share our thoughts. Sugr is in the last stage of development and will be available for early access shortly. Every contributor of this campaign will automatically be invited to our enthusiast community and will be able to download the app before launch.</p>

<h2>Risks?</h2>
<p>The risks associated with this project are minimal, but for the sake of transparency, they are included.</p>
<p>The main risk is that Sugr can't attract enough users in time to cover operating costs. For this reason, it is <strong>extremely important to reach as many people as possible</strong> after launch. This requires resources. </p>

But there is more to this story. In Sugr the number of compliments you get is only determined by the number of compliments you send to others. This spiral of positive energy can realistically make the world a better, happier and even more beautiful place. This is my dream.
 
So what can you do with Sugr?
I have kept it simple and only focused on the most important part. That is to deliver the experience as easily as possible.
1. Get compliments


Get compliments from people all over the world. Let's be fair - to get compliments, you also have to send some. In Sugr the number of compliments you receive is solely based on the number of compliments you send. Your received compliments are delivered to you every morning. This way you can start every day with discovering what people like about you.
2. Only positive

Every message is analyzed. Messages that contain offensive context will not be delivered. The Sugr is built upon a sophisticated fraud prevention algorithm. The system flags every suspicious compliment and prevents them from being delivered. These compliments are then being inspected by human eyes. If the message is obviously offensive, it gets deleted, while the user associated with the message gets terminated immediately.
3. Chat

Start chatting with people you get compliments from. This is a great way to say thanks. 
4. Anonymous

Every compliment is anonymous by default.  This means that you appear as ""Anonymous"" with your blurred main picture to the receivers of your compliment  by default. You can ask others to reveal themselves or you can reveal yourself if you get requested. 
 
Let's talk about business


Money is important, but… Sugr is a self funded project and will be launched almost certainly.
The money raised through Indiegogo is directly helping to reach more people than I could afford by myself. This is everyone's interest. The more people are using the application, the more compliments there are to receive. Remember: The aim is to reach as much people as possible to make Sugr an extraordinary user experience.

The most important goal of this campaign therefore is to build a community and share our thoughts. Sugr is in the last stage of development and will be available for early access shortly. Every contributor of this campaign will automatically be invited to our enthusiast community and will be able to download the app before launch.
What do community members get?
1. All community members have early access to the application.
2. Get regular updates about the final stage of the project.
Members who contribute financially to the project will get limited premium features in the application once launched, including:
3. Non purchasable items (green, gold and red border for your uploaded pictures, so every user is going to see that you are part of Sugr’s success from the first day)
4. Purchasable premium features at a great discount (Double compliments, Triple compliments)
5. All contributors will be placed under “People who made Sugr possible” both on the Website and in the App, with an optional social media link, for lifetime.
See more details under the Perks section.
 
Perks (detailed)
Every community member's benefits:
1.Early access

Community members will be able to download and get the hang of Sugr before the official launch later this year. This is a great way to shape Sugr to personal needs before the official launch.
2.Regular updates

I share regular updates in the community where every member can stay up do date with the project. This is especially important for a member who is contributing financially.
 
Financially contributing community member's benefits:
3.Borders

You are able to select a non-purchasable special border for your pictures.Other users will see this when they navigate to your profile. This way everyone will know that you were here from the start and invested in Sugr. If Sugr ever will be a success story, everyone will know that you were an essential part of it.

Default (none)
Serious backer's green
Epic backer's golden
Invaluable backer's signature red


4.Premium features

In Sugr the number of compliments you receive is solely based on the number of compliments you send. The more compliments you send, the more compliments you are going to receive. You can also boost the number of compliments with the following features:
The ""Double compliments"" feature allows you to get two times as much compliments as regular users do. 
The ""Triple compliments"" feature allows you to get three times as much compliments as regular users do.
5.Appear in App and on the Website

Both the App and the Website will have a section for all community members who contributed financially. This section is called ""People who made Sugr possible"". Contributing members will be listed here with optional social media link after launch.
Members will stay here for the lifetime of the app.
 


Risks?
The risks associated with this project are minimal, but for the sake of transparency, they are included.
The main risk is that Sugr can't attract enough users in time to cover operating costs. For this reason, it is extremely important to reach as many people as possible after launch. This requires resources.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Q: WHY NOT MENSTRUAL CUPS?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">94% of menstruating women prefer to use either pads or tampons, while only 6% prefer to use alternative options. Despite sales having risen over the years for menstrual cups, through our research into feminine care products and surveys, we've found that the majority of women would still prefer to use their traditional methods over switching to this option, even though it produces little to no waste. What we decided as a company was that for mass adoption we needed to offer women products that were familiar, but more sustainable than the ones they were currently using, as well as better for their bodies.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We believe our applicator free, completely biodegradable tampons will have just as large, if not a larger, positive environmental impact because of the ease of mass adoption. And while our pads are not completely biodegradable, the anion provides other amazing health benefits that a menstrual cup does not, such as promoting positive moods, pain relief, balancing the body and eliminating harmful bacteria.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">At Goddess in the Red, we still acknowledge and believe that menstrual cups are a great option for women who don't want to use pads or tampons! We hope to introduce our very own design in the future and will continue to innovate towards better, more sustainable products .</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Q: ARE YOUR TAMPONS SAFE AND DO THEY WORK AS WELL AS THE CONVENTIONAL ONES?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">A: Of course! :) Our tampons (and anion pads) are FDA-approved and meet all the typical absorbency standards. Our manufacturer’s facilities are both ICEA and GOTS (ICEA: European Eco/Bio Standard, GOTS: Global Organic Textile Standard) certified. Our tampons are lab-tested to ensure there are no chemicals, synthetic fibers, pesticides, or dioxins.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Q: IS TSS REALLY AN ISSUE ANYMORE?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">A: While rare, the risk of TSS still exists and can be life threatening. It is the main reason the FDA requires all companies to list TSS warnings, and absorbency charts on tampon boxes. The viscose rayon found in conventional tampons provides the optimal breeding grounds for the toxin that is responsible for Toxic Shock Syndrome. Often times rayon fibers can break off and remain in the vagina even after the removal of a tampon. Our tampons have a smooth organic cotton coating that not only aids in a more comfortable insertion but also stops fibers from being left behind. Additionally, there has never been a reported case of tampon-related TSS with 100% cotton tampons.</p>

 The most requested feature on the free web app shrib.com is rich text formatting.
I am Luzi, the maker of shrib.com, and I challenge you to put your money where your mouth is: Fund the time to implement this feature for all future generations of shrib.com users.
The more money we can collect, the more formatting features will I be able to implement for you!
  I Need Time To Give You Rich Text Formatting
 The funds collected through this campaign go into the development of the rich text formatting feature at shrib.com. Since the scope of the feature and the implementation details are easily scalable, there is a rather arbitrary campaign goal of $10'000.  Any more funds will help make the feature even better. If you and I don't meet the basic goal - then the time for the feature is not now. You will get your money back.
You will make a difference to thousands of people like you who use shrib.com for their daily notes, their flexible to-do lists, their knowledge sharing platform, their work tool, their family reunion planning, etc.
Depending on your funding support, you will get early access to the new feature and varying free subscriptions to shrib.com's sibling, shrib.co. Plus, there is a rare chance to get your own shrib.com note address! A shrib.com URL that will be reserved for you alone.
    Feature Details
 
Here are the main requirements for this change:

shrib.com must work like it does today: very fast, very simple, no login requirement.
all new features must load asynchronously: the page must be ready for typing fast.
the feature must degrade gracefully: if a browser does not support 
the RTF feature, formatted notes must still be editable in some way. 
the overall site design must stay as clean as possible.

These are the feature details:

basic inline style formatting (bold, italic, underline, links)
extended inline style formatting (colors)
block style formatting (paragraph, headings, lists)
images (integration with imgur or other service)
other multi-media embeds

The plan is to get at least the steps 1-3 within the campaign goal 
budget. Any additional funds or extra time left will go into the other ones.


shrib.com's user base is growing steadily since its inception. It gets over 10'000 visits daily, from all around the world. It is used by lots of different crowds for a huge number of different purposes. It is a piece of the global internet infrastructure.
Expected Challenges
 So far, implementing and improving shrib.com over the years was one big lesson in the non-deterministic world of so-called ""internet standards"". One of the biggest challenges (of any internet product) is cross-browser compatibility. 
One specialty of shrib.com is its inherent aim to be compatible with as many browsers and devices as possible (not just the latest versions of the 5 most common browsers!). 
The other one is that the overall download volume must be minimal. Therefore, the number of third-party libraries are kept to an absolute minimum (or zero if possible). For rich text formatting, I will definitely use a third party library. But, as mentioned above, it will be included in an asynchronous way.
Finally, there will be a whole challenge for the sharing of formatted notes across devices and browsers of varying capabilities. I will have to take good care to the case where the same note is created with formatting, then is edited with a browser without javascript. What should the app do? These are the kinds of things that usually are and really should be totally unknown and irrelevant to the user - but they can take a huge lot of time.
  No Money? No Worries!
 There are lots of ways you can help that go beyond money:

<p>Hello, my name is Jacob Willis, and I am the creator of MoneyStat.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437686585/hdqetdkrpqpdrigccmvi.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; padding-right: 15px; width: 50%;""/>Personal finances used to be such a burden for me when I was younger. A few years ago, I created a custom budget spreadsheet to make things a little easier. For the most part, it helped me to know how much money I had available at any point in time so that I didn’t accidentally spend too much and overdraft my account. Over the years I tweaked and improved it so that it did most of the organizing automatically. As helpful as it was, I realized that spreadsheets are still very limiting. I wanted an app that I could access anytime on my smartphone, that had calendar reminders built in, and that basically did all my budgeting for me. I looked around for an app that could take care of those needs, but I wasn’t able to find one. Most apps or budget programs out there function on a monthly basis and don’t account for the fact that most people are paid biweekly, so paychecks never line-up. They also don’t factor in things like grace periods and late fees. I wanted an app that did what my spreadsheet did, but with all the benefits that you get with an app, so I decided to just create one myself. That app is MoneyStat.</p><p>This campaign will help me and the amazing development team I am working with to get MoneyStat off the ground. This is something that I have been dreaming about and working on for years, and we have all the designs, functionality, and formulas figured out. It’s become so much more than just an idea, and we’re super excited about it! What we need from each of you now is your support so that we can hit our goal and make MoneyStat a reality so others can realize freedom from finances that I've experienced! We can’t do it without you!<br/></p><p></p><h2>What It Will Cost</h2><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437769432/rj45n2hjhplh23wrjw7a.png"" src="""" style=""width: 100%;""/></p><p>The app will be FREE and that's why we need your help, to get this amazing FREE tool into everyone's hands. We decided this was too big of an idea and too important of a need to make everyone pay for it. So we decided to keep the basic version of the app  100% free to anyone with a smartphone or tablet device. We will NOT be selling or giving away anyone's data! PERIOD! What is on your device stays on your device and that's it.</p><p>To help sustain the company and keep the product growing we will be offering a premium monthly Cloud Sync service for $4.99/Month that will allow you to access your financial data in MoneyStat on multiple devices, share a single account with your significant other, help teach your kids how to budget and teach them sound financial practices, and give you access to a wealth of additional data and statistics about your financial habits. Everything will be kept secure, safe, and encrypted. We are still committed to your privacy and will NOT be selling or giving away anyone's data! PERIOD! It's your data, and your privacy. Reporting information will all be calculated and generated on the fly. Information stored will be kept to a minimum and what we can encrypt we will. We'll be using this too and will protect your data with as much care as we do our own!</p>
<h2>What We Need</h2>
<p>We feel that MoneyStat is too important to not give it 100% of what it deserves, so we have decided to launch our campaign with fixed funding. We will only receive the funding if we reach our full goal of $15,000, which will cover MoneyStat’s programming and development. This task will be completed by ThinkDigital.io, a local development team with many years of experience. The members are hard workers, and I personally know and trust each one of them.

We are a small company founded by two friends trying to find cool solutions for daily problems. Yochai Paran – Electronics Engineer and Oded Matas- MechanicalEngineer. Together with our friend, Yadin Porat, we came up with a solution to one of the most frustrating  things for young parents – How not to lose precious time searching for pacifiers while our sweet and beloved baby is crying. Or even worse - threatens to wake up if the saver pacifier does not enter his mouth immediately.
As most young parents we suffered a lot untill an idea came up and NELI (Neverlose it) was created in our frustrated minds. 
NELI will beep and flash when you whistle to it. It will reveal itself and help allparents and their babies sleep better.
Our first prototype was very basic but did the trick:



Our proto raised a few issues and challenges:
- How are we going to sterilize and clean it without harming the electronics?
- How to maintain low weight to fit a baby's mouth?
- How to make sure it will not beep when not asked to ( false alarms) 
- And of course – How to prepare it for serial production. 
After a few months of intensive work we came up with our current cool NELI prototype.




The first two challenges were solved - The electronics part is bayonet detachable for safe and easy cleaning and the weight is minimal.
Although our prototype is great we still have two costly issues to solve and that’s why we need your help. To complete the design and start serial production we still have some work to do:

1.  Redesign the electronic module to eliminate all false alarms. We estimate this task at 6 months and $40,000.
2. Serial production preparation is easy but the most costly part. Plastic injection molds , production fixtures and packaging design are estimated at 5 months and $130,000
3. We estimate some more logistics and certifications (Like FDA approval) at another $20,000.
Help us bring NELI to serial production and help all parents sleep better . In return for your help and contribution  we are offering  the following Perks:
For $10 - If you like our idea and just want help with a small contribution we'll send you a NELI picture with our thank you note.For $50 - Together with our thanks , we'll send you one (1) boy's or a girl's NELI and you'll get to be one of the first few to have it.
For $70 - Together with our thanks, we'll send you one ( 1)  boy's or a girl's NELI packed in a fancy gift package and you'll get to be one of the first few to have it.For $150 - Together with our thanks, we'll send you one (1) boy's or a girl's NELI  and you'll be able to choose the name to appear on the back of your pacifer , instead of the NELI logo .For $1000 - Together with our deep appreciation and one of the above choices , you'll get to be mentioned and your name printed on the back of all NELI's packages, as a contributer to bringing NELI to the market. 


We don't belive in partial work , so  If we don't reach our entire funding  goal we'll not claim it and you'll get your contribution back, with our thanks.
If we'll reach the funding goal the promised perks are garentied .",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><span>GREEN ROSALES</span></h3>
<h3>- Organic and nicotine-free Hemp Cigarettes</h3>
<br/>
<p>As a smoker for more than 20 years, I continually tried to find an effective remedy to ease the process of quitting the cigarettes completely. I tried several very different products but always ended up surrendering to the urge and long-time habit of smoking. As these remedies did not have the desired effect on me, I started searching for a substitute for tobacco and it was during this process I discovered ‘Industrial grade hemp’. Though traditional cannabis is often used as an illegal drug, other strains of the same plant species has other uses. Industrial grade hemp is already used as a legal raw material for as various purposes as animal feed, clothing fibers, car panels and bedding material etc. Industrial hemp is known to contain an insignificant amount of the intoxicating substance THC <i>(Tetrahydrocannabinol)</i> - it contains as little as 0,2% and has absolutely no intoxicating effect at all. I have now joined forces with some like-minded people and we are hoping IndieGoGo will be be the perfect platform for the start-up of a project like ours. </p>
<br/><p>We call ourselves GREEN ROSALES and we would like to produce organic and nicotine-free Hemp Cigarettes and make them available as a product for smokers worldwide. The Green Rosales Hemp Cigarettes contain no nicotine, are produced 100% organic and are a less toxic alternative to smoking tobacco. As the Green Rosales Hemp Cigarettes produce a thick and soothing white smoke, which tastes mildly of hemp, they can be used as a placebo for smokers who want to fully quit their addiction to nicotine. You cannot get addicted to Hemp Cigarettes as they contain 0% nicotine. </p>

<br/><p>We are not endorsing anyone to smoke, even though our Hemp Cigarettes are not addictive. But if you want to QUIT smoking we encourage you to try our Green Rosales Hemp Cigarettes by participating in our crowdfunding and help us make our product a reality.</p>
<br/><p>We have set our crowdfunding goal at $100.000 as this will enable us to set up a small-scale production of our Hemp Cigarettes. One of the primary reasons Green Rosales Hemp Cigarettes is launched through IndieGoGo is to explore if there is a marked for a product like this. We are in collaboration with an organic and authorized hemp farmer, who grows the hemp we need for our Hemp Cigarettes and by launching a crowdfunding we will be able to know the quantity needed to meet the hopefully substantial demand for a product like this.</p>
</div><div>
<p></p>
<p><span>We hope to get support from everyone who wants to quit smoking tobacco or, at least, smoke an organic product with no nicotine or additives. If we can get enough people to support these organic and legal Hemp Cigarettes, we will try to make the product available through resellers worldwide.</span></p>
<p>The setup of a larger production is depended on, whether this crowdfunding on IndieGoGo gets overfunded or not.

The first step to accurately prescribe the amount of food is to accurately assess the energy needs of the dog. That’s what FitBowl is doing.

The first step to accurately prescribe the amount of food is to accurately assess the energy needs of the dog. That’s what FitBowl is doing. FitBowl calculates the energy your dog daily need upon the details of dog’s breed, age, gender, weight, activity level, BCS (Body Condition Scoring), castrated or spayed and food. Btw, the technique of BCS is the most accessible and popular method for estimating obesity in dogs.FitBowl is a smart bowl for weight control management system which includes weight gain, weight loss and weight maintenance.

<p><strong>Hey Everyone! This is Stephen</strong> (guy in the video), and I wanted to thank you for coming to the Tier 3 Energy Drink Mix page. As the video stated, I have been an energy supplement junkie for over 10 years, and Tier 3 is like a love letter to energy drinks. I have cherry-picked the very best ingredients from all the products I've consumed over the years and combined them into the only energy supplement you'll need. It's made specifically with your workday in mind so you can stop wanting to take naps halfway through the day and start crushing the day. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571681433/gm3orpuoiv91dgvlwxvw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Tier 3 energy drink mix is single-serve packets with <strong>3 choices of caffeine levels</strong>, while also containing nootropics for aiding in concentration and memory retention, electrolytes for maximum hydration and vitamins to boost your immune system. You simply add the contents of the stick to 12oz of water, stir, shake, or mix and BOOM; you're good to go.  It was created for your workday - whatever that looks like, as we all need more energy at work.</p>
<p>The graphic below shows the equivalent to how many cups of coffee equals the caffeine amount.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571683077/jerv8tf42jqy37gpoqle.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p>​Energy is what we all want more of. Tier 3 uses a combination of <strong>green coffee bean extract</strong> and <strong>theanine</strong>. The green coffee bean extract is a natural caffeine source, and theanine is a relaxing agent that doesn't sedate you. This awesome combo means that you get the alertness and energy from the caffeine but without the harsh jolt that caffeine usually brings. Think of it like taking off in a plane instead of slamming into your seat on a rocket. Theanine also helps with relaxation, so if your job is extra stressful, we have you.</p>
<p>Best part? Tier 3 lets you choose which caffeine level is right for you by offering 90mg of caffeine, 185mg of caffeine, or 285mg. You get the focus, hydration, and immune boosts at every level - so don't worry! All of this is also carried in convenient to-go packets. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571686185/ugyag4x0bkqwyetvmmcs.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p>The focus blend is brought to you by <strong>nootropics</strong>, or <strong>brain vitamins</strong> as they're sometimes referred to. CDP-Choline is the first nootropic included that aids in increasing attention and memory retention while helping cognitive decline. Have you noticed how you feel more alert in the morning and more mentally sluggish as the day goes on? CDP-Choline helps alleviate that. </p>
<p><strong>L-Carnitine</strong> is up next, which also <strong>aids in decreasing cognitive decline</strong> while also supporting the learning markers in the brain. This practically means you can stay sharp longer and cut through the brain fog we all sometimes get.</p>
<p>Last and certainly not least is <strong>phosphatidylserine</strong>. This spelling bee participant's worst nightmare is a powerhouse of a nootropic, which aids in <strong>memory retention and increasing attention</strong>. It also helps regulate mood swings and reduce cortisol levels (cortisol is the stress hormone).</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571686701/j0zdr6ec40afabdcizn8.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>If you're anything like the team here at Tier 3, you carry around your water bottle wherever you go. We know staying hydrated is essential as staying hydrated leads to more energy, a clearer mind, better mood, and helps in weight loss. Tier 3 want's to make sure you're getting the most out of your water by adding potassium, sodium, and magnesium to the mix. <strong>Say goodbye to the sticky carbonated energy drinks</strong>, and hello to the hydrating energy mix of Tier 3. </p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>No one likes getting sick. Let's start using our sick days at work to spend more time with friends and family and <strong>leave the sickness behind</strong>. Tier 3 has vitamins D3 and C for the immune system boosts and vitamins B6 and B12, for an extra energy boost. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Tier 3 uses natural flavoring and coloring, is keto diet-friendly, is <strong>0g net carbs and has no sugar or added sugar</strong>. It is sweetened with a mixture of stevia and a little bit of erythritol, NOT sucralose. Sucralose is in a lot of our competitors, but we at Tier 3 weren't satisfied with some of the studies done on how it affects gut health and insulin levels.</p>
<p><u>Tier 3 will also launch with the Tropical flavor for all 3 strengths</u>. We will also have a non-proprietary label once we begin manufacturing (meaning we tell you how much of each ingredient is in there).</p>
<p> </p>

<p>As stated in the video, we need support in the form of $40,000. That number represents what it costs to manufacture the minimum amount of product for a manufacturing run (not cheap, I know). We have brought the product as far as we can financially, and we need YOUR help to get us this last mile to the finish line.</p>
<p>SO! In order to help you get you all fired up, we are <strong>offering Tier 3 boxes at a big discount</strong> to what it will eventually be at the retail level. If successfully funded, we will manufacture and have boxes with 15 sticks to a box. We are for the people here at Tier 3 after all, so you get to choose which levels you want to go in your box.</p>
<p>This means that if you're a total caffeine juggernaut and your significant other is a total caffeine whimp, no worries! You can build your box to satisfy both of you.</p>
<p>Tier 3 was also formulated here in the United States and will be manufactured right here in the United States. <strong>THIS IS ALSO AN ALL OR NOTHING FUNDING</strong>. Meaning, if we cannot reach our goal, Tier 3 will not be manufactured at this time. With that being said, if you contributed and this doesn't get funded, <u><i>you will get your money back.</i></u></p>
<p>So pick the perk that you're comfortable contributing to and get your pre-order confirmed!</p>

<p> </p>
<p>If we reach our goal of $40,000, we will then take that money straight to the manufacturer and begin manufacturing. They quoted us <strong>approximately 10 weeks</strong> to get everything right and packaged up to ship. We will, of course, be updating you all with every update we get. It's our hope that there's nothing but smooth sailing, but we will update you if any delays occur.</p>

<p><strong>Tier 3 was made for YOUR workday</strong>. We wanted to make something that didn't just give energy, but other benefits like focus, memory retention, feeling hydrated, and boosting the immune system. This way, you can have more energy and a clearer mind to crush your workday. And as the video stated, I have been an energy drink consumer for YEARS. I know what works and what doesn't work, and Tier 3 combines the ingredients that just work. The chart below does a good job explaining the difference between the other guys and us.</p>

</div><div><h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3></div></div>","Hey Everyone! This is Stephen (guy in the video), and I wanted to thank you for coming to the Tier 3 Energy Drink Mix page. As the video stated, I have been an energy supplement junkie for over 10 years, and Tier 3 is like a love letter to energy drinks. I have cherry-picked the very best ingredients from all the products I've consumed over the years and combined them into the only energy supplement you'll need. It's made specifically with your workday in mind so you can stop wanting to take naps halfway through the day and start crushing the day. 


Tier 3 energy drink mix is single-serve packets with 3 choices of caffeine levels, while also containing nootropics for aiding in concentration and memory retention, electrolytes for maximum hydration and vitamins to boost your immune system. You simply add the contents of the stick to 12oz of water, stir, shake, or mix and BOOM; you're good to go.  It was created for your workday - whatever that looks like, as we all need more energy at work.
The graphic below shows the equivalent to how many cups of coffee equals the caffeine amount.


 

 
​Energy is what we all want more of. Tier 3 uses a combination of green coffee bean extract and theanine. The green coffee bean extract is a natural caffeine source, and theanine is a relaxing agent that doesn't sedate you. This awesome combo means that you get the alertness and energy from the caffeine but without the harsh jolt that caffeine usually brings. Think of it like taking off in a plane instead of slamming into your seat on a rocket. Theanine also helps with relaxation, so if your job is extra stressful, we have you.
Best part? Tier 3 lets you choose which caffeine level is right for you by offering 90mg of caffeine, 185mg of caffeine, or 285mg. You get the focus, hydration, and immune boosts at every level - so don't worry! All of this is also carried in convenient to-go packets. 
 

 

 
The focus blend is brought to you by nootropics, or brain vitamins as they're sometimes referred to. CDP-Choline is the first nootropic included that aids in increasing attention and memory retention while helping cognitive decline. Have you noticed how you feel more alert in the morning and more mentally sluggish as the day goes on? CDP-Choline helps alleviate that. 
L-Carnitine is up next, which also aids in decreasing cognitive decline while also supporting the learning markers in the brain. This practically means you can stay sharp longer and cut through the brain fog we all sometimes get.
Last and certainly not least is phosphatidylserine. This spelling bee participant's worst nightmare is a powerhouse of a nootropic, which aids in memory retention and increasing attention. It also helps regulate mood swings and reduce cortisol levels (cortisol is the stress hormone).
 

 
If you're anything like the team here at Tier 3, you carry around your water bottle wherever you go. We know staying hydrated is essential as staying hydrated leads to more energy, a clearer mind, better mood, and helps in weight loss. Tier 3 want's to make sure you're getting the most out of your water by adding potassium, sodium, and magnesium to the mix. Say goodbye to the sticky carbonated energy drinks, and hello to the hydrating energy mix of Tier 3. 
 

 

 
No one likes getting sick. Let's start using our sick days at work to spend more time with friends and family and leave the sickness behind. Tier 3 has vitamins D3 and C for the immune system boosts and vitamins B6 and B12, for an extra energy boost. 
 

 
Tier 3 uses natural flavoring and coloring, is keto diet-friendly, is 0g net carbs and has no sugar or added sugar. It is sweetened with a mixture of stevia and a little bit of erythritol, NOT sucralose. Sucralose is in a lot of our competitors, but we at Tier 3 weren't satisfied with some of the studies done on how it affects gut health and insulin levels.
Tier 3 will also launch with the Tropical flavor for all 3 strengths. We will also have a non-proprietary label once we begin manufacturing (meaning we tell you how much of each ingredient is in there).
 


 

 
As stated in the video, we need support in the form of $40,000. That number represents what it costs to manufacture the minimum amount of product for a manufacturing run (not cheap, I know). We have brought the product as far as we can financially, and we need YOUR help to get us this last mile to the finish line.
SO! In order to help you get you all fired up, we are offering Tier 3 boxes at a big discount to what it will eventually be at the retail level. If successfully funded, we will manufacture and have boxes with 15 sticks to a box. We are for the people here at Tier 3 after all, so you get to choose which levels you want to go in your box.
This means that if you're a total caffeine juggernaut and your significant other is a total caffeine whimp, no worries! You can build your box to satisfy both of you.
Tier 3 was also formulated here in the United States and will be manufactured right here in the United States. THIS IS ALSO AN ALL OR NOTHING FUNDING. Meaning, if we cannot reach our goal, Tier 3 will not be manufactured at this time. With that being said, if you contributed and this doesn't get funded, you will get your money back.
So pick the perk that you're comfortable contributing to and get your pre-order confirmed!
 

 
If we reach our goal of $40,000, we will then take that money straight to the manufacturer and begin manufacturing. They quoted us approximately 10 weeks to get everything right and packaged up to ship. We will, of course, be updating you all with every update we get. It's our hope that there's nothing but smooth sailing, but we will update you if any delays occur.
 


 

 
Tier 3 was made for YOUR workday. We wanted to make something that didn't just give energy, but other benefits like focus, memory retention, feeling hydrated, and boosting the immune system. This way, you can have more energy and a clearer mind to crush your workday. And as the video stated, I have been an energy drink consumer for YEARS. I know what works and what doesn't work, and Tier 3 combines the ingredients that just work. The chart below does a good job explaining the difference between the other guys and us.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This wouldn't be possible without your help! You all are the reason we are so excited to create Tier 3. We know it's a great product, but know sharing it with you means we all win!
It would mean a lot to us if you shared this campaign with anyone you think could benefit from a more energized workday - or your rich friends with a hole burning in their pocket! Please message us with any questions, and we will get back to you as soon as possible. hello@tier3energy.com.

<p>Il y a quelques années, j'ai fait des crises d'asthme sévères qui m'ont valu des hospitalisations au service des urgences et en pneumologie. Je précise que je ne suis pas asthmatique. Après une multitude d'examens, le pneumologue m'a annoncé que j'étais victime d'un syndrome qui déclenche des crises d’asthme à la prise de certains médicaments. Comme je ne veux pas que cette maladie soit un frein à mon besoin de voyager, j'ai donc traduit sur papier, dans la langue du pays où je me trouvais, le nom du syndrome qui fait définitivement partie de ma vie ainsi que les produits qui peuvent déclencher les crises d'asthme.</p>
<p>Plus tard, alors que je me trouvais à l'aéroport d'Orly, j'ai rencontré à la descente de mon avion un couple d'espagnols qui avait l'air paniqué. Ils ne parlaient que leur langue maternelle et ne savaient pas comment expliquer leur problème. Je leur ai demandé ce qui se passait et la dame m'a expliqué que la compagnie avait oublié son bagage à Barcelone et que tous ses médicaments se trouvaient à l'intérieur. Je lui ai donc indiqué où se trouvait le service des urgences de l'aéroport afin qu'elle aille leur expliquer la situation et se faire prescrire le traitement adéquat. J'ai alors réalisé que j'étais loin d'être le seul à connaitre cette angoisse de ne pas être compris à l'étranger en cas d'urgence médicale.

<p>A few years ago, I had severe asthma attacks that led to hospitalizations in the emergency department and in pneumology. I specify that I am not asthmatic. After a multitude of exams, the pulmonologist told me that I was suffering from a syndrome that triggers asthma attacks when taking certain medications. Since I do not want this disease to be a hindrance to my need to travel, I translated on paper, in the language of the country where I was, the name of the syndrome that is definitely part of my life and the products that can trigger asthma attacks.</p>
<p>Later, while I was at the Orly airport, I met a Spanish couple who was panicked when I got off the plane. They spoke only their mother tongue and did not know how to explain their problem. I asked them what was going on and the lady told me that the company had forgotten her luggage in Barcelona and that all her medicines were inside. I told her where the airport emergency department was so that she could explain the situation to them and be prescribed the appropriate treatment.

<h3>What is VOXXBODY?®</h3>
<p>We all want to be fit and healthy. That's why so many people invest their time and money in gym memberships, classes, home workouts, personal trainers, or fitness apps. </p>
<p>But there's one crucial part of your body that is neglected by virtually every fitness program on the market today. Something you use every single day: <i>your voice. </i></p>
<p>I'm Charles Simmons, vocal coach, personal fitness trainer, and creator of <strong>The VOXXBODY® Vocal Fitness System. </strong>This award-winning workout combines fitness training and vocal exercises.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566860708/xioz1rc31aorylzsygyp.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Many people hire me to help them get physically fit, or to help them improve their voices for shows, presentations, or general daily use. I created VOXXBODY® to be the best of both worlds. It allows you to train your voice and your body <i>at the same time</i>, through a series of safe, short, effective workouts. This saves you lots of time, money, and stress.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566860615/knnobonpmsa3rgyncwxv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Who Is VOXXBODY® For?</h3>
<p>VOXXBODY® is probably the world's first <i>true</i> full-body workout. It's great for</p>
<ul>
<li>amateur, semi-professional &amp; professional performers (singers, actors) who don’t have time to workout and take voice lessons separately</li>
<li>public speakers who want to improve their vocal and physical stamina</li>
<li>teachers &amp; trainers who quickly lose their voices while teaching</li>
<li>fitness fans looking for a fun, innovative new way to train</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The best part: <i>you don't have to know how to sing to do VOXXBODY®! </i>In fact, over 60% of our current VOXXBODY® users are <i>not</i> singers. I created the program for <i>everyone</i> who has a desire to improve their voices, get in shape, and have some fun in the process.</p>

<h3>What We Need, What You Get</h3>
<h3>
<span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The feedback we've received since launching VOXXBODY in 2018 has been phenomenal. We are looking to secure funding for our newest program, </span><strong style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;letter-spacing: 0px;"">VOXXBODY II®</strong><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">, a workout that will take our VOXXBODY® concept to a whole new level.</span>
</h3>
<p>As part of the new program, we are proud to introduce the<strong> VOXXStick™,</strong> an innovative weight training device that compliments the brand-new workouts in VOXXBODY II®. The VOXXStick consists of two dumbbells, a weighted pole, and a base. This device can be used in three different modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stage Mode, which looks like a microphone on a stand.</li>
<li>Barbell Mode, which allows it to be used like a classic barbell seen in gyms the world over.</li>
<li>Freddie Mode, which simulates the microphone setup of legendary Queen frontman Freddie Mercury.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The VOXXStick™ provides you with the necessary resistance to make your training physically challenging. At the same time, it will let you experience what it’s like to perform like your favorite artist. </p>
<p>In other words: You’ll train like an athlete, but feel like a rock star.</p>
<p>Do you like Pop, Rock, R&amp;B, Hip-Hop, Dance, or Latin-influenced music? We got you covered! VOXXBODY II® will have brand-new workouts that are more modular and genre-specific. This will allow you to freely mix and match your favorite music styles for your workout sessions. For example, you will be able to combine a Warmup circuit in an R&amp;B style, a Core circuit in a Hip-Hop style, a Full-Body circuit in a Latin style, and a Cardio circuit in a Dance style. This gives you more flexibility in your workouts and makes VOXXBODY II® more fun. More genre-specific workouts will be made available in future updates.</p>
<p>My company, Charles Simmons Music &amp; Fitness UG, needs 25.000€ to launch VOXXBODY II® and the VOXXStick™ worldwide. The funding will be used for the production of the new workout videos, prototyping and manufacturing of the VOXXStick™, and online advertising via our website and social media.</p>
<p>We have working mockups of the VOXXStick™ that we are using to choreograph the new workouts. We’re excited to be working with the company König and Meyer (<a href=""https://www.k-m.de"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.k-m.de</a>), one of the world’s leading makers of musical instrument accessories, on the production of the VOXXStick™.</p>
<p>Depending on your level of sponsorship, you will receive special discounts on (or free versions of) VOXXBODY®, VOXXBODY II® and the VOXXStick™. </p>
<p>Even if we don't reach our complete funding goal, rest assured that your investment will be put to good use. As an early adopter, you will <i>definitely</i> receive the perk based on the amount of your investment. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566860507/q3pardvugwx5pr0ceurj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Fitness trends come and go. It seems like a new exercise fad is popping up every week, and it's sometimes hard to keep up with every new trend. Rarely does a workout program come along that combines two things that everyone loves to do; in this case, working out and singing.</p>
<p>VOXXBODY® has been battle-tested. I've had the privilege of working with some of the most talented musicians in Europe and the USA, from my celebrity clients (Alice Merton, Rea Garvey, The Backstreet Boys, Marius-Müller Westernhagen, Guano Apes, Moses Pelham, Shaggy, and many more) to my students at the renowned University of Popular Music and Business (aka Popakademie) in Mannheim, Germany.

We all want to be fit and healthy. That's why so many people invest their time and money in gym memberships, classes, home workouts, personal trainers, or fitness apps. 
But there's one crucial part of your body that is neglected by virtually every fitness program on the market today. Something you use every single day: your voice. 
I'm Charles Simmons, vocal coach, personal fitness trainer, and creator of The VOXXBODY® Vocal Fitness System. This award-winning workout combines fitness training and vocal exercises.

Many people hire me to help them get physically fit, or to help them improve their voices for shows, presentations, or general daily use. I created VOXXBODY® to be the best of both worlds. It allows you to train your voice and your body at the same time, through a series of safe, short, effective workouts. This saves you lots of time, money, and stress.

Who Is VOXXBODY® For?
VOXXBODY® is probably the world's first true full-body workout. It's great for

amateur, semi-professional & professional performers (singers, actors) who don’t have time to workout and take voice lessons separately
public speakers who want to improve their vocal and physical stamina
teachers & trainers who quickly lose their voices while teaching
fitness fans looking for a fun, innovative new way to train

 
The best part: you don't have to know how to sing to do VOXXBODY®! In fact, over 60% of our current VOXXBODY® users are not singers. I created the program for everyone who has a desire to improve their voices, get in shape, and have some fun in the process.


What We Need, What You Get

The feedback we've received since launching VOXXBODY in 2018 has been phenomenal. We are looking to secure funding for our newest program, VOXXBODY II®, a workout that will take our VOXXBODY® concept to a whole new level.

As part of the new program, we are proud to introduce the VOXXStick™, an innovative weight training device that compliments the brand-new workouts in VOXXBODY II®. The VOXXStick consists of two dumbbells, a weighted pole, and a base. This device can be used in three different modes:

Stage Mode, which looks like a microphone on a stand.
Barbell Mode, which allows it to be used like a classic barbell seen in gyms the world over.
Freddie Mode, which simulates the microphone setup of legendary Queen frontman Freddie Mercury.

 
The VOXXStick™ provides you with the necessary resistance to make your training physically challenging. At the same time, it will let you experience what it’s like to perform like your favorite artist. 
In other words: You’ll train like an athlete, but feel like a rock star.
Do you like Pop, Rock, R&B, Hip-Hop, Dance, or Latin-influenced music? We got you covered! VOXXBODY II® will have brand-new workouts that are more modular and genre-specific. This will allow you to freely mix and match your favorite music styles for your workout sessions. For example, you will be able to combine a Warmup circuit in an R&B style, a Core circuit in a Hip-Hop style, a Full-Body circuit in a Latin style, and a Cardio circuit in a Dance style. This gives you more flexibility in your workouts and makes VOXXBODY II® more fun. More genre-specific workouts will be made available in future updates.
My company, Charles Simmons Music & Fitness UG, needs 25.000€ to launch VOXXBODY II® and the VOXXStick™ worldwide. The funding will be used for the production of the new workout videos, prototyping and manufacturing of the VOXXStick™, and online advertising via our website and social media.
We have working mockups of the VOXXStick™ that we are using to choreograph the new workouts. We’re excited to be working with the company König and Meyer (www.k-m.de), one of the world’s leading makers of musical instrument accessories, on the production of the VOXXStick™.
Depending on your level of sponsorship, you will receive special discounts on (or free versions of) VOXXBODY®, VOXXBODY II® and the VOXXStick™. 
Even if we don't reach our complete funding goal, rest assured that your investment will be put to good use. As an early adopter, you will definitely receive the perk based on the amount of your investment. 


Risks & Challenges
Fitness trends come and go. It seems like a new exercise fad is popping up every week, and it's sometimes hard to keep up with every new trend. Rarely does a workout program come along that combines two things that everyone loves to do; in this case, working out and singing.
VOXXBODY® has been battle-tested. I've had the privilege of working with some of the most talented musicians in Europe and the USA, from my celebrity clients (Alice Merton, Rea Garvey, The Backstreet Boys, Marius-Müller Westernhagen, Guano Apes, Moses Pelham, Shaggy, and many more) to my students at the renowned University of Popular Music and Business (aka Popakademie) in Mannheim, Germany. All of them agree that VOXXBODY® is an innovative way to get physically and vocally fit.
I believe that everyone should reap the benefits of having a strong body and voice, which is why my company wants to bring VOXXBODY® to as many people as possible.

Other Ways You Can HelpWe need your help to build critical mass and help keep production costs down. But even if you can't make a financial contribution, you can still support the VOXXBODY® cause by doing the following:

<p>I have been a<strong> health coach </strong>for a few years; I mostly work with people who have <strong>infertility issues and stress-related health problems</strong>. I'm always seeking new ways to help others, which brought me to yoga. I have learned that the combination of yoga and health coaching can help my clients gain fertility sooner than by following dietary changes alone. This is why I decided to incorporate yoga in my treatment methods.</p>
<p><strong>Health is 70% nutrition and 30% exercise so it’s worth focusing on proper exercises – I have found that yoga is an incredibly effective way of improving female health and fertility.</strong></p>
<p>The Benefits of the well-chosen yoga sequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>can increase your chances of getting pregnant</li>
<li>reduces stress</li>
<li>strengthens the endocrine system</li>
<li>increases blood flow to the reproductive organs</li>
<li>may help to clear adhesions and blockages int he reproductive areas</li>
<li>can increase libido (which is not a bad thing if you are trying to get pregnant)</li>
<li>supports a healthy immune system and supports the body in detoxifying</li>
<li>encourages a positive mindset</li>
<li>lessens side effects of hormonal treatments</li>
<li>increases IVF success rates</li>
</ul>
<p>This is why I decided to incorporate yoga in my treatment methods and if I can support my studies financially, I will start a Fertility Yoga Teacher Course this spring. Using the knowledge and skills from this course I want to create accessible online videos to teach women about<strong> healthy, alternative treatments for infertility.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In order to do this, I need your help.</strong></p>
<p>The combination of nutrition, stress management, and the proper exercise supports positive growth and increased health. It is important to use several treatment methods to provide the <strong>best overall health care</strong>. The Fertility Yoga Teacher Course will allow me to learn the best yoga sequences and ayurvedic eating styles to treat infertility, menstrual problems and stress-related health issues.</p>
<p>I find it important to support women on their journey of getting pregnant in as many ways as possible, so I will create online videos to teach women about alternative treatment methods in case of infertility, including yoga. This way, anybody could access the knowledge, regardless location. I would really-really love to expand my services and offer a 2in1 experience because it's for sure that nutrition, stress management and the proper choice of exercises can support real health. That is why I find it important to combine the methods. </p>

<h3>She*Pak Is a Cool Idea!</h3>
<p>My name is Pam Cole, the inventor of She*Pak and President of Femicorp.  Hi!  I am a physical therapist (PT) and wound specialist.  I invented She*Pak while having my own issues with chronic vaginitis.  In PT, we ice inflammation, but when I was having issues, I was told to take a warm sitz bath, which only made me feel worse.  I found a way to ice the area, and I got so much relief!  As I was developing the idea of She*Pak many friends and clinicians have told me all the others reasons that She*Pak can calm burning, swelling, itching, and pain of the vagina and external structures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vaginitis - bacterial or yeast</li>
<li>Vaginal child birth</li>
<li>Post menopausal intimacy</li>
<li>Post cancer treatment intimacy</li>
<li>Syndromes causing painful sex: vulvodynia, clitorodynia, vestibulodynia</li>
<li>Urogynecological surgeries</li>
<li>Endometriosis</li>
</ul>
<p>I have become passionate about folks getting pelvic floor relief without pharmaceuticals, or at least until the prescription medication can work!</p>
<p>We made an initial batch of She*Paks to see if it would work in the market place.  Would people buy it?  Would clinicians embrace it? <strong> The answer is a resounding yes and yes! </strong>  I have passionate, good feedback from customers (see Amazon and  testimonials at the bottom of femicorp.com).  Many depend on their She*Pak on a regular basis.  When we have exhibited at professional meetings the She*Pak booth gets a lot of traffic and attention.  Frankly, then clean us out of thousands of brochures and website business cards.</p>
<p>We are ready to fund our next batch of She*Paks but with feedback and ideas from customers, and in a way that it can support manufacturing in volume and in bringing down the cost, so we can reach more women around the world! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>
<strong>Where Will Your Support Go? </strong> </h3>
<ul>
<li>Design work - We need to design and test the changes that customers want in She*Pak, as well as, redesigning the package to be smaller and more eco-friendly.</li>
<li>Tooling/Molds - The changes to product and moving to high volume manufacturing means new molds.  These are quite expensive but can last the company for a long time.</li>
<li>Product - The real point of all this is making She*Paks that we can go BIG with!</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<strong>What Can You Get?</strong>  </h3>
<p>Fun things for everyone, whether you need a She*Pak or not!   We have regular ice packs, t-shirts, the next version of She*Pak, and combination perks.  Stay tuned for additional perks as the campaign evolves!</p>
<h3><strong>We Only Keep the Money If We reach Our Goal!  </strong></h3>
<p>We are out to make new and improved product,  so we need to hit our goal.  If we don't make our goal, we can't move on.  We need your support!  </p>

The Impact and Recent Media
 There are health issues and social issues both nationally and globally stemming from unprotected sex.  Some of those issues include:  Unwanted pregnancies that either contribute to an ever increasing global population crisis, or tragically end in abortion.
Sexually Transmitted and life-threatening diseases that affect the individual and family/friends.
This is a proven and safe form of birth control and protection used for over 400 years.  On October 14, 2015 the New York Times published an article about yet another form of birth control with purported health risks.
The specially designed packaging essentially protects your protection.
In the past 7 days of this month, both Digital Trends and the Inquisitr published stories online about the trending ""NETFLIX and chill"" condoms.
On October 14th, a Daily News article about Lamar Odom collapsing at a Nevada brothel owned by Dennis Hof of HBO's Cathouse series states in the article that ""all men must wear a latex condom"".
In February 2015 CNN reported that due to a shortage in Venezuela, a box of condoms was selling for $755.00 which represents 85% of the average Venezuelan monthly income.
In July 2015 QUARTZ reported that India lifted a price cap on condoms because quality condoms were disappearing off the shelves.  Some living in the country were forced to order quality condoms from Amazon here in the USA.
In Google SERP's(Search Engine Results Pages), most people worldwide are embarrassed to purchase condoms over the counter, this innovation of our unique packaging concept makes it interesting and easy.

<p>The ninja of feudal Japan were quick to adopt and innovate and were always on the cutting edge of technology. They were known to rapidly adapt to new technologies such as blackpowder, rockets and guns imported from China or Europe. Training tools for ninjutsu have always been difficult to acquire because they were not commercially viable to produce on a mass scale, but with the advent of 3D printing the capability of manufacturing specialist products in small batches has become a reality.</p>
<p>Embodying the spirit of the ninja, Sekibi was founded to provide high quality, historically accurate and cost effective training equipment for ninjutsu and the other schools of the Bujinkan, an organisation dedicated to preserving the history and traditions of the samurai and ninja.</p>
<p>The Togakure Ryū Equipment Set One is the culmination of years of training, research and study into the ninjutsu school of Togakure Ryū. The tools are based on designs in Hatsumi Masaaki's collection, the grandmaster of the Bujinkan, and modified for safety in a martial arts training environment.</p>

<p>The Togakure Ryū Equipment Set project is comprised of seven ninja tools. The set includes traditional equipment used by ninja and in the school of Togakure Ryū ninjutsu; the Kyoketsushoge, a straight edge with a hook connected to a ring by rope or hair used for scaling and climbing; the Kunai, a heavy trowel used for digging, cutting and scaling; the Shuko, hand claws used for climbing and scaling walls; the Bo Shuriken, a nail used for securing or scratching; the Ita Ken, a double sided hand chisel used for scraping or drilling; the Hira Shuriken, a star shaped star that could be thrown or used to misdirect; and the Senban Shuriken, a square shaped blade that was used to lever up nails among other things. </p>

<p>The equipment set comes with jute, sisal or cotton twine, which can be used to wrap handles or modify the fit of the training tools. Jute is a natural soft fibre used in twine, rope and matting; Sisal is a courser material, but more durable, used in in the manufacture of paper, cloth, footwear, hats, bags and carpets; and cotton, a softer alternative used primarily for textiles. All three twine varieties are included in the set to cater to different preferences. </p>

<p>The rope for the Kyoketsushoge is constructed from multi-filament polypropylene, which has a high break strength but is also soft and comfortable to handle. The ring is made of high density pressure hose and wrapped in elastometric insulation that is soft and durable.

<p>Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol (PETG) is strong, light and durable, used in many industrial and consumer goods. It is also impact resistant and heat resistant, making it an excellent material for training equipment. The printing process creates the object by placing down thin layers of filament, one atop another. Our printers have over 100 layers per 25mm, giving our tools a strong and solid bond. </p>

<p>Our tool designs have been specifically tailored for 3D printing in mind in order to optimise the unique properties available in the printing process. As training tools, we have added elements of safety, rounding edges and blunting points to make the equipment set effective for even intensive training and techniques. </p>

<p>Sekibi already has the infrastructure to produce 180 equipment sets in 6 months, however 3D printing is subject to economies of scale. What this means is that the more money we raise, the more printers we can buy, the faster we can produce equipment and the more rewards we can offer per tier.  </p>
<p>We have created the following stretch goals to promote the project and give supporters incentives to share and talk about the equipment set. The larger we grow, the more we can offer.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533874705/qqk1auhsdymwd0sjr7mi.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Should orders exceed $120,000 AUD, more stretch goals will be added. </p>
<p>Each of the stretch goal addition will be added to every equipment set. The kakushi is a ring with a pointed end; the kanide are small cat claws, historically used by Kunoichi (female ninja) as a concealed self-defence tool; and the alternate Kunai design has a straighter blade with deeper angled tip making it more useful for sawing or drilling.</p>

<p>My goal is to make <strong><i>Ecuador 100% biological agriculture </i></strong>and to become a beacon of light to the rest of the world by applying the most important technology of the 21st century to improve our health, halt global warming, increase fresh and clean water and live harmoniously with nature.</p>
<p>Today, there are now 3 chemical companies (Bayer/Monsanto, ChemChina/Syngenta and Dow/DuPont) that have assets of almost $350 billion fighting for the $4 trillion food agricultural industry.  They are competing with each other to sell producers more chemicals and GMO seeds.  They are concentrating capital in agro-chemical business because they are losing money from their own competition but also, more importantly, due to many food producers not wanting their products and would prefer to go back to a natural approach to agriculture based on soil microbiology.  Now is the time to accelerate the growth of organic agriculture and put more nails in their coffin.</p>
<p>Non-infectious diseases from chemicals in our foods and applied to our bodies are growing at epidemic rates and they include 35 types of cancer, diabetes types 1 and 2, autism, Parkinson, Alzheimer, depression, sexual dysfunction, metabolic syndrome and many others.  Conventional agriculture is responsible for almost 40% of global warming due to 1.  Tillage and chemical pesticides that kill microorganisms in the soils who consume almost 50% of carbon for their diet, 2. Deforestation, and 3. Cattle methane gas.  Conventional agriculture also uses almost twice the water as organic and poisons it with excess nitrogen which destroys streams, rivers and water life. </p>
<p>The UN 2013 Conference on Trade and Development Report written by over 50 world scientific experts clearly stated that the all agriculture must become sustainable by 2025 to halt disease and the environmental destructive effects from conventional agriculture.</p>
<p>The book was written to primarily inform Ecuadorian producers and consumers of the basic science of biological agriculture and provide an approach to organize and change the societal infrastructure for a better life.  It can also be applied globally.</p>
<p>Contrary to agribusiness mythology, it is indeed possible to turn every farm - cost effectively - into an organic farm and we must for our children and our future.</p>
<p>Your support will help accelerate the growth of organic farms in Ecuador and around the world, creating more organic food at affordable prices and a healthier planet Earth.</p>
<p>   <strong>Together we can change the world!</strong></p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
<p>The funding target is $5000 for a first printing.  This amount will help print and distribute 4000 books within Ecuador at the major universities and key book stores in several major cities.  The revenues gained from the sales will be used to print more books and should be self-funding from this point forward.</p>
<p>The more money that is raised, the more books can be printed. If the goal is not reached, whatever money is raised will be used to print as many books as possible.  We believe that we can change the world and make it better for everyone, something we are dedicated to make happen in our work and personal lives.</p>
<p>Your support will help accelerate the growth of organic farms around the world and produce healthy food for all. </p>
<p>Shelly is originally from Chicago where he grew up after coming to the United States from Germany after WWII.  His working career started in steel mills and factories as a machinist and mechanic. He received his electronic engineering degree (at the age of 35) from Purdue, graduating number one in his class and then worked in data communications for the next thirty years for many global corporations.  He received his Master’s in Information Technology at 55 and spent two years studying organizational behavior towards a PhD. During his last twelve years working at Cisco, Avaya and Zebra Technologies he has provided leadership in strategic alliances with other global companies such as Motorola, Honeywell, Rockwell Automation, IBM, and HP.  He wrote a book explaining his collaboration model that is considered a best practice at all of these companies, Strategic Collaborative Partnering.</p>
<p>After retiring to Ecuador on a farm, he began to learn what organic agriculture was all about and applied his engineering and organizational experience to learn, change and teach.  His interest in the value of organic food increased significantly when he learned that his oldest daughter’s breast cancer and his granddaughter’s type one diabetes were both directly related to food and the immune system.  He now teaches nutrition and biological farming in Ecuador to local people at rural clinics, universities and towns to small and large producers.</p>
<p>Shelly has a successful track record in engineering and business and is very committed to doing the right thing that benefits all of humanity and our environment.</p>
<p>Risks &amp; Challenges</p>
<p>The book is the culmination of three years of intensive research sifting through many hundreds of peer reviewed papers and books from all over the world.  It is divided into chapters that cover every aspect of conventional and organic agriculture and their impacts on society, mostly focused on Ecuador.  However, it can generally be applied to any country in the world since the principles of the science, economics, culture and sociology remains the same.</p>
<p>The book is currently available online, however most Ecuadorians and also South Americans do not have internet access.  Printing is the only way to reach the most people</p>
<p><strong>Together let’s change the world by helping every farmer cost effectively turn their farm into an organic farm that produces only healthy natural food, uses less energy and water while reducing global warming!</strong></p>

Non-infectious diseases from chemicals in our foods and applied to our bodies are growing at epidemic rates and they include 35 types of cancer, diabetes types 1 and 2, autism, Parkinson, Alzheimer, depression, sexual dysfunction, metabolic syndrome and many others.  Conventional agriculture is responsible for almost 40% of global warming due to 1.  Tillage and chemical pesticides that kill microorganisms in the soils who consume almost 50% of carbon for their diet, 2. Deforestation, and 3. Cattle methane gas.  Conventional agriculture also uses almost twice the water as organic and poisons it with excess nitrogen which destroys streams, rivers and water life. 
The UN 2013 Conference on Trade and Development Report written by over 50 world scientific experts clearly stated that the all agriculture must become sustainable by 2025 to halt disease and the environmental destructive effects from conventional agriculture.
The book was written to primarily inform Ecuadorian producers and consumers of the basic science of biological agriculture and provide an approach to organize and change the societal infrastructure for a better life.  It can also be applied globally.
Contrary to agribusiness mythology, it is indeed possible to turn every farm - cost effectively - into an organic farm and we must for our children and our future.
Your support will help accelerate the growth of organic farms in Ecuador and around the world, creating more organic food at affordable prices and a healthier planet Earth.
   Together we can change the world!
What We Need & What You Get
The funding target is $5000 for a first printing.  This amount will help print and distribute 4000 books within Ecuador at the major universities and key book stores in several major cities.  The revenues gained from the sales will be used to print more books and should be self-funding from this point forward.
The more money that is raised, the more books can be printed. If the goal is not reached, whatever money is raised will be used to print as many books as possible.  We believe that we can change the world and make it better for everyone, something we are dedicated to make happen in our work and personal lives.
Your support will help accelerate the growth of organic farms around the world and produce healthy food for all. 
Shelly is originally from Chicago where he grew up after coming to the United States from Germany after WWII.  His working career started in steel mills and factories as a machinist and mechanic. He received his electronic engineering degree (at the age of 35) from Purdue, graduating number one in his class and then worked in data communications for the next thirty years for many global corporations.  He received his Master’s in Information Technology at 55 and spent two years studying organizational behavior towards a PhD. During his last twelve years working at Cisco, Avaya and Zebra Technologies he has provided leadership in strategic alliances with other global companies such as Motorola, Honeywell, Rockwell Automation, IBM, and HP.  He wrote a book explaining his collaboration model that is considered a best practice at all of these companies, Strategic Collaborative Partnering.
After retiring to Ecuador on a farm, he began to learn what organic agriculture was all about and applied his engineering and organizational experience to learn, change and teach.  His interest in the value of organic food increased significantly when he learned that his oldest daughter’s breast cancer and his granddaughter’s type one diabetes were both directly related to food and the immune system.  He now teaches nutrition and biological farming in Ecuador to local people at rural clinics, universities and towns to small and large producers.
Shelly has a successful track record in engineering and business and is very committed to doing the right thing that benefits all of humanity and our environment.
Risks & Challenges
The book is the culmination of three years of intensive research sifting through many hundreds of peer reviewed papers and books from all over the world.  It is divided into chapters that cover every aspect of conventional and organic agriculture and their impacts on society, mostly focused on Ecuador.  However, it can generally be applied to any country in the world since the principles of the science, economics, culture and sociology remains the same.
The book is currently available online, however most Ecuadorians and also South Americans do not have internet access.  Printing is the only way to reach the most people
Together let’s change the world by helping every farmer cost effectively turn their farm into an organic farm that produces only healthy natural food, uses less energy and water while reducing global warming!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Why You Will Love This</h2>
<p><strong>It's Comfortable</strong></p>
<p>Ok, I’m about to get real here. Going through 9 months of crazy hormonal changes and, lets be honest, a lot of weird bodily changes (anyone else start growing hair in places they didn’t expect??) leaves your nipples feeling super tender. Then, what do we do with those already tender nipples? We stick them in a little person’s mouth! And while you and baby are getting the hang of how to breastfeed, it can get a bit uncomforta…scratch that. It can be painful. The last thing you need is something itchy on your nipple. These breast pads are soft.</p>
<p><strong>It's Absorbent</strong></p>
<p>You may be thinking “Yada, yada, yada. The one-piece, recyclable packaging thing sound cool and all, but most importantly I need this thing to absorb all the leakiness coming out of my milk bags.” Not to fear, Mama! These premium breast pads are manufactured with high-absorbency technology and keep you looking dry and not like a crazy, half asleep lady who wondered out of the wet T-shirt contest.</p>
<p><strong>It's Discrete</strong></p>
<p>No one wants to be walking around looking like their “headlights” are on, am I right? Yikes. Some breast pads out there are so cone shaped it looks like your nipples are tiny rocket ships attempting to blast off from earth, but are being rudely interrupted by your shirt. Maybe some people are into that look…uh, ya, but I’m definitely not. If you’re not into that look either, you should defiantly try Maytera’s breast pads. If you are into the rocket ship look, you’re going to want to pass on this product.</p>

<p><strong>No gel beads</strong></p>
<p>You know those little beads that are in a lot of things that are absorbent? If you have any kids in diapers, you’ve probably seen them. Basically, if the diaper gets super full, the gel beads absorb the moisture, but some of the beads can soak through onto the other side, i.e. you have little gel beads on your baby’s cute little bottom. You just wipe them off and then you’re good to go. The thing that I’m concerned about though, is if my breast pad uses those gel beads, what if some of them seep through onto my skin and I don’t know it? What if I go to feed my baby and, without me knowing, my newborn baby eats those things? Now, in a product that uses gel beads for absorbency, they don’t get on the skin super often. So it may never be a problem. But, for me and my baby, I don’t want to risk it.</p>
<p><strong>Recyclable Packaging</strong></p>
<p>Ugh, so much waste. Have you ever used a different disposable breast pad? You end up with a ton of tiny pieces of trash. With Maytera’s breast pad, the packaging is recyclable. So, rather than being upset about all the trash you have to throw away, you can be a proud Mama-Warrior who laughs in the face of excess waste and victoriously recycles her breast pad wrapper like the strong and heroic champion you are!</p>
<p><strong>It's Easy to Open</strong></p>
<p>This is the part that gets me really excited. I have two small children of my own, so I’ve been there. I get it. I understand that right after you’ve had a baby, the tiniest thing can fill your warm heart with joy or make you well up in tears, because you just… can’t… do it. It’s a hard time in a mama’s life. You need everything to be as easy for you as possible, because you have one really, really hard thing using up all your energy. Don’t get me wrong, having a child is wonderful and such a blessing. However, it’s also super difficult. Anything you can do to make things easier on yourself during this difficult time, do it.</p>

<p>When I was pregnant with my daughter, I did a bunch of research on how to take care of myself and my baby. I found tons of information on how to take care of my baby, but not much info at all about how to take care of myself. I looked at websites. I went to bookstores. I talked to my doctor. All had so much to tell me about taking care of my baby, but very little about how to take care of myself. The little information I was able to get on taking care of myself was almost exclusively regarding during pregnancy. What do I do for myself after I give birth?

Now we know we were not ready for this type of disaster. Many people got infected and sadly many lost their lives. Socializing stopped; meeting up with friends at local restaurants and bars became a thing in the past. Offices and businesses closed down. Doctors and dentist appointments got cancelled indefinitely. But the question is for how long? and how can we make the situation better? How many times a day do we have to sanitize our office and home using the harmful chemicals? Disinfectant products can be effective, but they can't be used on surfaces like rugs, walls, electronics, professional equipment, and many more. Hence, we invented T-150, the heavy-duty smartphone-controlled disinfecting machine that uses ultraviolet radiation to disinfect all surfaces within minutes. </p><p> </p><h2><strong>Meet T-150</strong></h2><p>We are UV APEX, an American manufacturer that specializes in commercial grade equipment.

This invisible radiation includes the wavelength range of 100 nm to 400 nm. Known as Germicidal Ultraviolet, UVC light emits radiation specifically within the 200 - 300 nanometer wavelength. Do not be mistaken by the cheap products using regular UV lights (100-200 nm wavelength). T-150 leverages the UVC Germicidal lights for powerful and deep disinfecting action.</p><p> </p><h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598644686/dvh399ywuglsw9vyilj6.jpg"" src=""""/></h2><h2> </h2><h2><strong>How UVC Light Kills Viruses </strong></h2><p>As evident by multiple research studies and reports, when biological organisms are exposed to deep UV light in the range of 200 nm to 300 nm it is absorbed by DNA, RNA, and proteins. Absorption by proteins can lead to rupture of cell walls and death of the organism. Absorption by DNA or RNA (specifically by thymine bases) is known to cause inactivation of the DNA or RNA double helix strands through the formation of thymine dimers. If enough of these dimers are created in DNA, the DNA replication process is disrupted, and the cell cannot replicate.</p><p>UVC technology is not a new thing. It has been in use for a decade. We have used UVC light in air and water filtration systems for a long time. The pandemic forced us to expand the usage of UVC light. Nowadays people are using UVC light to sanitize their phones, countertops, computers and many other devices and surfaces. Why? Because there are no chemicals involved. You cannot spray disinfecting chemicals on everything, for example your electronics or foods. But how about your room, office, bathroom or basically any space you have to spend time in? Is there any way to sanitize the whole space in a few minutes without using any chemical? And not only the surfaces and devices but also the air.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598644722/srmstjmgk9evp7gwmgxj.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h2> </h2><h2><strong>A Note from CDC</strong></h2><p>Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) is the use of ultraviolet (UV) energy (electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength shorter than that of visible light) to kill or inactivate viral, bacterial, and fungal species.

Now we know we were not ready for this type of disaster. Many people got infected and sadly many lost their lives. Socializing stopped; meeting up with friends at local restaurants and bars became a thing in the past. Offices and businesses closed down. Doctors and dentist appointments got cancelled indefinitely. But the question is for how long? and how can we make the situation better? How many times a day do we have to sanitize our office and home using the harmful chemicals? Disinfectant products can be effective, but they can't be used on surfaces like rugs, walls, electronics, professional equipment, and many more. Hence, we invented T-150, the heavy-duty smartphone-controlled disinfecting machine that uses ultraviolet radiation to disinfect all surfaces within minutes.  Meet T-150We are UV APEX, an American manufacturer that specializes in commercial grade equipment. Using sturdy long-lasting materials and engineering excellence, our team has designed and built T-150, an ultimate addition to any home, office, gym, etc. T-150 sanitizes virtually any space. Packed with mighty 150 watts of power and 360 degrees of UVC light, T-150 cleans the surrounding space of any kind of viruses, bacteria, mold, algae yeast and roundworms.   To Our Dear BackersFor the past 5 months UV Apex has been working on the design, prototyping and testing T-150. Today we have the production sample ready. We manufacture T-150 at our facility in Los Angeles along with handheld units we have been manufacturing and they are sold out (check our website www.uvapex.com ). The machine you see in our video is the actual production sample. The good news is we are ready to start the production. We are hoping Indiegogo can help us to reach more people.  Powerful UVC, not the ""ordinary"" UVUltraviolet (UV) light is a component of the electromagnetic spectrum that falls in the region between visible light and X-Rays. This invisible radiation includes the wavelength range of 100 nm to 400 nm. Known as Germicidal Ultraviolet, UVC light emits radiation specifically within the 200 - 300 nanometer wavelength. Do not be mistaken by the cheap products using regular UV lights (100-200 nm wavelength). T-150 leverages the UVC Germicidal lights for powerful and deep disinfecting action.  How UVC Light Kills Viruses As evident by multiple research studies and reports, when biological organisms are exposed to deep UV light in the range of 200 nm to 300 nm it is absorbed by DNA, RNA, and proteins. Absorption by proteins can lead to rupture of cell walls and death of the organism. Absorption by DNA or RNA (specifically by thymine bases) is known to cause inactivation of the DNA or RNA double helix strands through the formation of thymine dimers. If enough of these dimers are created in DNA, the DNA replication process is disrupted, and the cell cannot replicate.UVC technology is not a new thing. It has been in use for a decade. We have used UVC light in air and water filtration systems for a long time. The pandemic forced us to expand the usage of UVC light. Nowadays people are using UVC light to sanitize their phones, countertops, computers and many other devices and surfaces. Why? Because there are no chemicals involved. You cannot spray disinfecting chemicals on everything, for example your electronics or foods. But how about your room, office, bathroom or basically any space you have to spend time in? Is there any way to sanitize the whole space in a few minutes without using any chemical? And not only the surfaces and devices but also the air.  A Note from CDCUltraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) is the use of ultraviolet (UV) energy (electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength shorter than that of visible light) to kill or inactivate viral, bacterial, and fungal species. The UV spectrum is commonly divided into UVA (wavelengths of 400 nm to 315 nm), UVB (315 nm to 280 nm), and UVC (280 nm to 200 nm). The entire UV spectrum can kill or inactivate many microorganisms, but UVC energy provides the most germicidal effect, with 265 nm being the optimum wavelength Say Goodbye to:

<p>I started Muay Thai at the age of 14years old and have been training since then. I entered Singapore Kickboxing Championship in March 2019. I was representing the 54kg weight category and due to the lack of opponents, I fought at the 60kg weight category and emerged as a Champion from the two days tournament.</p>

<p>This will be a great opportunity to further my experience on a international level. As a kid, I never finished anything I started and when I found combat sports, I’ve always wanted to do more and achieve to the best of my ability. </p>

<p>What is this funding for? It’s going to be used for my expenses (Travel, Accommodation and Daily Expenses) when I’m in Bosnia. I’m not exactly sure what’s the actual amount I need, but I hope with the funds raised, it will be sufficient for my trip. In the event where there’s an amount left after my trip, I’m planning to use the funds to do some charity work (Still have yet to do my research and decide what I’m gonna do- but I’ll keep y’all posted)</p>

<p>Besides proving to myself that I am of a person who doesn’t do things halfway and give up, I wanna show the world and the nation, Singapore has decent combat athletics and it’s isn’t all about brawls and power. IT’S ABOUT BEING SMART, AND, HAVING A STRONG HEART. </p>

And the answer was hiding in plain sight, we realized that traditional foam, plastic and silicone ear plugs don't block sound, they absorb it!</p><p>Its quite simple when you think about it. Imagine wearing a plastic or foam helmet over your head. What would you hear? The sound level would be reduced but the resonating sound coming through would not be so clean and crisp. Both materials do block sound to some degree, but given their composition, they don't do such a great job. Plastic and foam ear plugs just don't cut it when it comes to low frequencies, and all of the fine details are lost in process and you are left in a world of sub-sonic pressure thats inescapable.  </p><p>Now imagine having that same helmet over your head, but instead of plastic or foam, imagine it is solid <strong>TITANIUM</strong> or <strong>ALLOY</strong>. Now what would you be hearing?</p><p>... Thats exactly what we thought!</p><p><strong>TITANIUM</strong> or <strong>ALLOY </strong>is traditionally a good conductor for sound, so it has been discredited for being a suitable ear plugs. Until now. What we have discovered is that once you incorporate a solid piece of dense metal into a soft foam tip that molds in your ear, sound can't penetrate through the metal. And without a direct connection between the sound source and the ear plug, the sound is no longer conducted, its blocked!</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">SPACE SILVER</h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1557201429/gvm9bqoj4js44krwt8xh.jpg"" src=""""/></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1547685347/vkuzigshwhkeaocykpn3.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Behind Blocking Low Frequencies</strong></p><p>Low frequencies produce the highest amount of energy, and traditional ear plugs do not do a good job at blocking out such high energy. When low frequencies are not properly diverted, it makes for a very unpleasant experience, almost as if you were to be underwater. Traditional ear plugs create a very muffled and disconnected feeling, whereas <strong>SOUNDOX™ SLIMS </strong>were specifically designed to avoid that experience at all cost necessary. </p><p><strong>SOUNDOX™ SLIMS</strong> are tested by a third party against a traditional foam earplug. All earplugs are tested using a direct sound source to sample the frequency levels of each earplug.</p><p>The orange signal trace displays the frequency attenuation of traditional foam earplug, the green signal tracing is the attenuation using the <strong>ALLOY SOUNDOX™ SLIMS</strong> and the blue signal trace is the attenuation of  the <strong>TITANIUM SOUNDOX™ SLIMS</strong>. </p><p>The data shows how both <strong>ALLOY</strong> and <strong>TITANIUM</strong> out perform traditional foam earplugs. When analyzing the blue and green signal traces, it can be seen that the <strong>SLIMS</strong> composed of <strong>TITANIUM</strong> block approximately 9dB more than the <strong>ALUMINUM SLIMS</strong>, this is due to the dense properties of titanium, allowing for a more detailed and harmonic hearing experience. </p><p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556577624/qwdoleilcnbkgnhrivds.jpg"" src=""""/><br/> </p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1547685347/vkuzigshwhkeaocykpn3.png"" src=""""/></h3><p><strong>Design</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>JET BLACK</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1557201574/t7pge6m1c1udjdkrnkme.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>SOUNDOX™ SLIMS</strong> <strong>are designed to stand the test of time. </strong></p><p>A revolutionary design is not just about <strong>FUNCTION</strong>, it is also about great visual <strong>FORM. </strong>We set out to design a ear plug that defines and pushes the limits of modern craftsmanship.

Block it!</p><p>Where traditional earplugs failed, is where <strong>SOUNDOX™ SLIMS</strong> picked up the slack. Standard foam ear plugs absorb sound attenuation, they can't physically block it. Considering the small size of a foam earplug, there just simply isn't enough body to block out sound. This lack of size allows sound to penetrate through the earplug making its way into your ear, the results are muffled distorted sounds in the high and mid frequencies with little to no reduction with low frequencies.</p><p><strong>SOUNDOX™ SLIMS </strong>dense <strong>ALLOY</strong> and <strong>TITANIUM</strong> composition block noise from entering the ears and attenuates mid and high frequencies with a clean finish.

We engineered SOUNDOX™ SLIM so sleek and comfortable you will forget they are even there. The all new SOUNDOX™ SLIMS are now available to pre-order. SOUNDOX™ SLIM deploys a patent-pending design that combines active noise filtration and acoustic noise attenuation to create a beautiful sound experience.  We have developed the SOUNDOX™ SLIM in three stunning finishes; JET BLACK, SPACE SILVER and ROSE PINK. With your help, if we exceed our goals we will engineer a solid TITANIUM edition of the SOUNDOX™ SLIMS. All SOUNDOX™ SLIMS will feature anodized space grade alloys with a miraculous HIGH-POLISH finish, and smooth edges that are pleasant to the eye and amazing to the touch. SOUNDOX SLIM are engineered to produce optimal comfort for all day and night usage. They include interchangeable tips in 3 sizes; SMALL, MEDIUM and LARGE. With this intended design, you can effortlessly swap your FOAM TIPS to find a size that fits you perfectly while providing maximum attenuation and true comfort.Always use protection, and we got you covered...

Concerts and Events (The beauty is in the detail, enjoy every moment with incredible details at very safe levels)

Traveling (Wether its by plane, train or car do it the right way)

Motorsports (Nothing beats the sound of a fine tuned motor, enjoy it the safe way)

Working (Your in it for the long run, protect your ears and look good doing it)
 Why SOUNDOX™ SLIM you might ask...What sets the SOUNDOX™ SLIMS apart from any other generic ear plug, is that SOUNDOX™ SLIMS are engineered to hoist a ergonomic fit that provides a seal to block damaging decibel levels from entering your ear, while allowing low frequency decibel levels to pass through. The beauty behind the design is that you can block out damaging sounds, while still enjoying a casual conversation.We have engineered the patent-pending technology, produced various prototypes and tested SOUNDOX™ SLIMS in ears of all shapes and sizes. After extensive test and implementations, we have fostered the perfect design that is truly accustomed to all ears.With the help and support of crowd funding, we will be able to bring this truly amazing earplug to the market and allow the world to enjoy ear protection as it should be, amazing.  By backing our crowdfunding campaign you will be the first receive SOUNDOX™ SLIMS before any online retailers. THE MAGIC BEHIND ITSOUNDOX™ patent-pending Technology.Soundox™ designers set out to discover why traditional ear plugs were performing so poorly. And the answer was hiding in plain sight, we realized that traditional foam, plastic and silicone ear plugs don't block sound, they absorb it!Its quite simple when you think about it. Imagine wearing a plastic or foam helmet over your head. What would you hear? The sound level would be reduced but the resonating sound coming through would not be so clean and crisp. Both materials do block sound to some degree, but given their composition, they don't do such a great job. Plastic and foam ear plugs just don't cut it when it comes to low frequencies, and all of the fine details are lost in process and you are left in a world of sub-sonic pressure thats inescapable.  Now imagine having that same helmet over your head, but instead of plastic or foam, imagine it is solid TITANIUM or ALLOY. Now what would you be hearing?... Thats exactly what we thought!TITANIUM or ALLOY is traditionally a good conductor for sound, so it has been discredited for being a suitable ear plugs. Until now. What we have discovered is that once you incorporate a solid piece of dense metal into a soft foam tip that molds in your ear, sound can't penetrate through the metal. And without a direct connection between the sound source and the ear plug, the sound is no longer conducted, its blocked! SPACE SILVERBehind Blocking Low FrequenciesLow frequencies produce the highest amount of energy, and traditional ear plugs do not do a good job at blocking out such high energy. When low frequencies are not properly diverted, it makes for a very unpleasant experience, almost as if you were to be underwater. Traditional ear plugs create a very muffled and disconnected feeling, whereas SOUNDOX™ SLIMS were specifically designed to avoid that experience at all cost necessary. SOUNDOX™ SLIMS are tested by a third party against a traditional foam earplug. All earplugs are tested using a direct sound source to sample the frequency levels of each earplug.The orange signal trace displays the frequency attenuation of traditional foam earplug, the green signal tracing is the attenuation using the ALLOY SOUNDOX™ SLIMS and the blue signal trace is the attenuation of  the TITANIUM SOUNDOX™ SLIMS. The data shows how both ALLOY and TITANIUM out perform traditional foam earplugs. When analyzing the blue and green signal traces, it can be seen that the SLIMS composed of TITANIUM block approximately 9dB more than the ALUMINUM SLIMS, this is due to the dense properties of titanium, allowing for a more detailed and harmonic hearing experience.  DesignJET BLACKSOUNDOX™ SLIMS are designed to stand the test of time. A revolutionary design is not just about FUNCTION, it is also about great visual FORM. We set out to design a ear plug that defines and pushes the limits of modern craftsmanship. With a design that incorporates smooth and symmetrical shapes to the fullest SOUNDOX™ SLIMS are as functional as they are ascetically pleasing. SOUNDOX™ SLIMS were designed to last forever. By using space grade ALLOYS and TITANIUM, the base of the ear plug will stand the test of time and anything you put them through. SOUNDOX™ foam tips are designed to last for continuous daily use, they are both water proof and hypoallergenic. When the time comes to replace the foam tips, simply grip and twist the foam tip to remove it from the metal base. To equip the ear plug with a new foam tip, simply slide the foam tip onto the tip connector, and with your index finer and thumb, press down on the base of the ear plug and the top of the foam tip and the ear plug will effortlessly come together with a gratifying click. SOUNDOX™ SLIMS include SMALL, MEDIUM and LARGE foam tips to ensure that you will find your perfect fit.  Have you ever experienced your ears ringing? Thats the sound of damage.The damage can happen anywhere, spinning class, live sport events, concerts the list goes on. Traditional ear plugs just don't get it done; they are fiddly, uncool and no fun to wear, especially in public.With SOUNDOX™ SLIMS ear plugs, you can still hear whats going on around you through natural bone conduction, but in much safer and practical manner. Most of us have experienced ringing ears, and then it fades away, but if you continuously expose your ears to damaging sounds that ringing sensation will no longer fade away, this is known as tinnitus. SOUNDOX™ SLIMS are designed specifically to combat this effect.  ROSE PINK  Forcefield of ProtectionWhen using SOUNDOX™ SLIMS the feeling they bring is comparable to having a force field of protection for your ears. What separates SOUNDOX™ SLIMS from every other ear plug, is not only the pleasing design, its the function of having the power to put the volume knob on the world around you. In a blaring environment, you will be able to hear the peaks of sound, while cutting out the damaging sound levels that harm your ears. They truly put your ears in a safe world, where you can still hear through natural bone-conduction allowing for a hearing experience paralleled by no other ear plugs.This force field of protection are ideal for blocking irritating sounds such as:
Sleeping
Motorsports
Work Place
Snoring
Planes, trains, buses and cars
Concerts
Fitness classes
Noisy households
And everywhere else that you would like to put a volume knob on. The secret behind it all.Don't try to absorb sound... Block it!Where traditional earplugs failed, is where SOUNDOX™ SLIMS picked up the slack. Standard foam ear plugs absorb sound attenuation, they can't physically block it. Considering the small size of a foam earplug, there just simply isn't enough body to block out sound. This lack of size allows sound to penetrate through the earplug making its way into your ear, the results are muffled distorted sounds in the high and mid frequencies with little to no reduction with low frequencies.SOUNDOX™ SLIMS dense ALLOY and TITANIUM composition block noise from entering the ears and attenuates mid and high frequencies with a clean finish. The design of SOUNDOX™ patent-pending technology disallows noise from conducting with the earplugs which allows the suer to effectively block their ears from direct sound waves.TITANIUM  FoamTipsAll set of earplugs are equipped with FoamTips in sizes small, medium and large.Developing a revolutionary FoamTip is key to SOUNDOX™. After countless test and trials Soundox developed a propriety memory foam tip that formulates into a perfect seal using your body's heat. SOUNDOX™ memory FoamTips are designed for ultra-comfort and continuous use. Our FoamTips are formulated to not tear or break down under normal wearing conditions.SOUNDOX™ FoamTips key features:
Ultra-Comfort
Durability to resistance ripping and breaking down
Body heat activated memory foam
 Fitting SLIMSEvery pair includes a set of small, medium and large foam tips, we suggest you try each size to determine what suits your ears best. Once suited with the ideal foam tip for your ear, simple squeeze and roll the foam tip between your thumb and index finger. Next insert the earplug into your ear and allow 45 seconds for the foam tip to fully rebound and create a sound proof seal. The info graph below provides a detailed illustration of the fitting process step by step. Risks and Challenges:SOUNDOX current risk and challenges consist of receiving adequate funding that is needed to bring the project to life. With your help we can change the world of traditional hearing protection. Current production stage:SOUNDOX SLIMS have been tested via prototype and are ready for production. Deliveries:Once we reach our funding goals, we expect to have orders going out 2-3 weeks after.",20.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Buddie is meant to be placed<strong> on pulse points</strong>, where blood vessels are closest to the skin. This ensures the gel patch nutrients are absorbed and delivered directly to the scalp. We recommend placing Buddie<strong> behind the ears</strong> or <strong>on your shoulders</strong> to see greatest results.</p>
<p> <br/>The gel patch’s adhesive layer allows you to keep Buddie <strong>securely attached</strong> even while you move about. However, it is also best to avoid areas with a lot of hair so that the patch has direct contact with your skin.</p>

The key to hair care is just a patch away.
 
Buddie is a scalp and hair care device that uses clinically proven technology to send nutrients to your scalp. It’s a safe and effective method of treatment that will protect and regrow your hair so you stay confident in how you look.
 

Safe and effective. 
Just 7 mins a day, 2x a week.
 
Going to the clinic requires extra time and money. Buddie, on the other hand, allows you to enjoy clinical care in the comfort of your home.
 
 

 


 
We combined the benefits of Transdermal Drug Delivery System (TDDS) and Iontophoresis for the nutrients to be delivered efficiently while remaining safe and non-invasive. As the nutrients reach the hair follicles from within your system, you’ll find the results to be more effective than treatment methods that attempt to spread nutrients from the outside in (shampoos, oils, laser treatment, etc),
 
 


 
Buddie is meant to be placed on pulse points, where blood vessels are closest to the skin. This ensures the gel patch nutrients are absorbed and delivered directly to the scalp. We recommend placing Buddie behind the ears or on your shoulders to see greatest results.
 The gel patch’s adhesive layer allows you to keep Buddie securely attached even while you move about. However, it is also best to avoid areas with a lot of hair so that the patch has direct contact with your skin.

 
 

 Enough with the hassle, the heavy helmets, and harmful ingredients. None of these provide the hair solution you asked for.Many hair growth products out in the market lead to empty promises. The progress is slow or perhaps nonexistent because they don't target hair loss problems at its core – the scalp. Let us introduce you to Buddie.
 FDA-cleared, clinically proven, and optimized efficiency. Read on to learn why we believe Buddie is so great.     The before and after results were measured after a 30-day use of Buddie 3 times a week. Please keep in mind that results vary greatly depending on each individual's lifestyle and diet. But here's clear proof that Buddie really works! Not only recommended by regular users, Buddie has also been cleared by the FDA, FCC as well as received the CE mark of Europe and KC of Korea.*Documents above show certification for “Peatch,” our product’s previous name before it became “Buddie.”   A clinical test conducted on 20 people using Buddie showed an immediate improvement on the scalp. Scalp firmness was improved by 12.99% and redness reduced by 36.34%.    Buddie was created by Rootonix, a team of scalp care specialists. We spent months perfecting the technology and design to make hair treatment accessible to all.The Rootonix team has actively participated in several hardware, patent, and tech expos in excitement to share our proud work. We’ve been lucky enough to have received recognition through several awards worldwide:
Grand Prix Award at the 2021 International Exhibition of Inventions Geneva
4 awards (Best Inventor, Gold, Silver, and Bronze) at the 2020 Seoul International Invention Fair (SIIF)
2 awards (Best Invention and Bronze Award) at the 2019 International Trade Fair for Ideas, Inventions, and New Products (iENA)
    Buddie uses a combination of Iontophoresis and TDDS (Transdermal Drug Delivery System) to absorb nutrients from the gel patch’s serum into the skin.  Once the nutrients enter below the skin, it enters the bloodstream. Buddie's technology then speeds up the circulation to your scalp.  The nutrients are dispersed from within your system to the scalp and hair follicles, creating an optimized environment for healthy hair growth.Just incorporate 7 minutes a day, 2 times a week into your routine and you’ll experience an effective hair treatment right at home.  Transdermal patches have become a popular form of drug delivery – melatonin patches, stress relief patches, nicotine patches, etc. But in order to maximize absorption, Buddie incorporates the  technology of iontophoresis. We conducted an experiment to measure the difference in absorption with and without iontophoresis. The test showed an 8x increase in effectiveness when iontophoresis was used, which leads to seeing much clearer results.This is why we decided to use iontophoresis in Buddie and how it can show you the progress you want to see.    Buddie helps to absorb all the moisture and nutrients from its patch. The level of absorption from Buddie's technology reaches a new depth that just patting down with your hands cannot.    The gel patch’s serum is made up of the best-quality ingredients, inspired by Korean skincare. It contains salicylic acid to reduce dandruff and excess oil, dexpanthenol to deeply hydrate the scalp and hair follicles, and l-menthol which helps soothe scalp irritation.These, along with other natural components like green tea and ginger extract, create the perfect formula for scalp care.   Buddie’s patch is composed of three thin layers that ensures the serum is delivered to the skin in a safe and effective manner.     You’ve got enough things to check off your to-do list. We didn’t want to add another.That’s why Buddie is designed to be carried easily and used anywhere. Pop it on during your work hours, downtime, or while you get other house chores done. Just incorporate 7 minutes a day, 2 times a week into your routine and you’ll experience an effective hair treatment right at home.    One unit weighs just 13g, less than half an ounce. Its case makes it extremely convenient to carry around too so that you can use it anywhere.  To maximize portability, Buddie is designed to charge within its case. So even after the unit runs out of battery, you can place it back in the case to recharge.        A single scalp or hair treatment can cost up to $100 per session. Say you try to keep up with this, like you should, and the bill can easily pile up.Buddie comes at a single cost while providing the same clinical care. It also saves you tremendous time by being able to receive the treatment right at home.           Please note: 1 device comes with 10 gel patch packs in the box, which contain two patches each — one for each unit.We're also providing a special $0 shipping fee promotion on the add-on patches for Indiegogo ONLY. Take this as encouragement to make scalp-care a long-term commitment! Looking for even more gel patches?We got you. After the campaign is over, additional orders of gel patches will be available on www.rootonix.com.          Please note: 1 device comes with 10 gel patch packs, which contain two patches each — one for each unit.    Q: How do I turn the device on?
After attaching the bridge and patch to the unit, press the center button for 3 seconds until you feel a light vibration. 
The session begins simultaneously as the device is turned on. Keep it placed behind your ear or on your shoulders during the session.
Once 7 minutes have passed, the unit will shut off automatically. Peel it off once it’s done.
 Q: Is it dangerous to stare at the LED light directly?A: Although there is no potential harm, it is not recommended to look directly at it for long periods of time. Q: Can people with sensitive skin also use Buddie?A: Please consult a professional first. It is not recommended for those using steroids or other drug substances, have allergic skin reactions, or have been diagnosed with skin conditions. Q: Are the bridge pieces easily damaged?A: They will not be damaged unless direct force is applied. However, please still be careful with how you handle the pieces when attaching them to the unit. Q: Can I place Buddie on my skin if it’s wet or sweaty?A: Please make sure to apply Buddie on dry, clean skin. This will maximize the effect of Buddie’s technology and thus help the nutrients absorb better into the skin. Q: Can I lie down while wearing Buddie?A: In order to avoid damaging the device, please do not apply force or pressure while wearing Buddie by lying down on it.

<h3>Kendo Mae Lai</h3>
<p><strong>The beginnings of a new Kendo Dojo in the northern Thai mountains.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>My name is Catherine Thompson and I have been practicing kendo for about 38 years. I started Kendo in Toronto, Canada when I was around 20, practiced for 4 years, was away from Kendo for a time and then came back in my late 20s. Now 63, these days I find myself helping with leading and teaching at a wonderful and unique dojo, Lanna Kendo, in Chiang Mai.</li>
<li>This fundraising campaign is concerned with raising enough money to start a Kendo practice  close to where I live in Mae Kampong in the mountains to the east of Chiang Mai.</li>
<li>At the beginning we will have our practices every week on Sunday mornings. My main intention is to try and and encourage some of the kids in the local villages here abouts to try out Kendo.  As is the norm with Kendo dojos around the world, all Kendoka, new or experienced, and of all ages will be welcomed as well.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The initial plan to get things started </h3>
<p><strong>and what the funds raised will go towards:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All funds raised will go towards renting a great practice space at <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/TharnthongLodge"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tharnthong Lodges </a>for 6 months and to purchase Shinai (the bamboo swords we use in Kendo) for the kids to use free of charge. Adults who wish to begin Kendo will be able to purchase their own shinai.</li>
<li>I'm choosing to commit to the 6 month period of time as I think that it will take a few months for word to get around and hopefully with time we can attract a number of people in the area who will wish to start Kendo.</li>
<li>There will be a very small charge for practices and will take the form of a donation box with a suggested minimum of 20 baht (80 cents) for children and 100 baht ($3) for adults. This will just be a suggestion and no one will be excluded if unable to contribute. Those with extra money to spare will be able to contribute more than the minimum, if they wish, knowing that all funds raised will go towards the dojo. Having the donation box will allow anonymity.  This is a part of the world where the minimum wage is around 10-12$ per day.</li>
<li>All money raised at practices will be put aside with the hope of garnering enough to continue with the practice space rental after the initial 6 months.</li>
<li>Any funds raised beyond our goal of $1200 will be used for other expenses that may come up such as Kendo uniforms, additional shinai, tournaments, gradings etc. I will also keep this campaign open beyond the end date in case people might like to contribute in the future. My hope is that this will be a long lived Kendo dojo and perhaps can even evolve to practicing more than once a week. Starting small and simple and see where we can take it from there!</li>
<li>Please note that any size donation that a person might wish to contribute will be deeply appreciated no matter how small or large that might be. I know that this is a tricky time financially for so many of us!</li>
<li>The funding goal of $1200 that I have set is enough to cover the initial expenses of 6 months of dojo space rental (฿21,600/~$660) and 10 children's shinai purchases ($340) in addition to the expenses that come by using the Indiegogo fundraising process, exchange rates and the 5% that is automatically put on hold for 6 months.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What I hope to be the impact of this new dojo</h3>
<ul>
<li>The All Japan Kendo Federation states that an essential aspect of the practice of Kendo is to develop the human spirit and character through the principals of the Japanese sword. In Kendo we learn that our biggest challenge is with our own selves and that it is a lifelong journey of learning, teaching and sharing. I believe that these principals combined with a disciplined and respectful structure certainly is of great benefit to young people and adults alike. </li>

Cwash can be used <strong>everywhere</strong> and <strong>save your time</strong>! It's smart, small, <strong>easy to carry</strong>, ecologic and <strong>antimicrobial</strong>!

<p>Cwash is both <strong>simple</strong> and <strong>innovative</strong>. </p>

<p>Cwash is a product made by <strong>Plus Biomedicals</strong>, an Italian startup operating in the biomedical sector since 2019.</p>
<p>Within two years we were able to hire 12 people, design 6 products, and inaugurate two new locations, one administrative and one productive.</p>
<p>Our payoff is <strong><i>Think Human, Think For Human</i></strong>, to underline the philosophy that distinguishes us and the commitment to create products that are able to improve people’s lives and well-being.</p>
<p>We mainly design aids for the disabled, bedridden, and people with reduced mobility to try to <strong>solve real problems</strong> of people who live everyday life as a big challenge.</p>
<p>In addition, given the pandemic in progress, we design and produce 2 different types of surgical masks entirely Made in Italy.</p>

<p>At the beginning, the product was born with a <strong>clear purpose</strong>: to create a device that would allow <strong>people with reduced mobility</strong>, disabled, elderly or bedridden to brush their teeth independently and easily. </p>
<p>But soon we realized that <strong>Cwash is much more</strong>: it is a product that everyone should have! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1618830345/ywzs85cvio0ntmhj5kcn.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>There are many situations in which Cwash can be truly decisive, for example:</p>
<p>-Try to think about brushing your teeth while<strong> traveling </strong>by car or plane, with the classic toothbrush is unthinkable, with Cwash is easy!</p>
<p>-Have you ever tried brushing your teeth <strong>with a child</strong> in your arms? With Cwash you can do it easily and safely!</p>
<p>-And what about cleaning teeth during <strong>office</strong> hours? Use Cwash wherever you are and whenever you want and bring it always with you!</p>

<p>Cwash is small and<strong> extremely handy</strong>: it can be using by simply pressing the index finger on the power button. While with one hand you use Cwash, with the other you can do whatever you want: cooking, reading, working, traveling, relaxing and much more!</p>

Cwash can be used everywhere and save your time! It's smart, small, easy to carry, ecologic and antimicrobial! Cwash connects wirelessly to your phone and can remind you when it's time to clean your teeth or can give you statistical metrics on how and for how long you take care of your teeth! 
Thanks to the combination of technological and biomedical research, Cwash is able to ensure proper oral hygiene. 

Cwash is both simple and innovative. 
The bite, consisting of a gradual release polymer combined with the vibrations of the bite itself (with adjustable intensities), allows efficient and accurate cleaning of the entire dental arch. 

At the end of the treatment, which has a recommended standard duration of 30 seconds and can be adjusted according to the desired treatment, it is not necessary to rinse. 
Any saliva produced during use can be ingested. It is recommended to rinse the bite after each use.            
        

Cwash is a product made by Plus Biomedicals, an Italian startup operating in the biomedical sector since 2019.
Within two years we were able to hire 12 people, design 6 products, and inaugurate two new locations, one administrative and one productive.
Our payoff is Think Human, Think For Human, to underline the philosophy that distinguishes us and the commitment to create products that are able to improve people’s lives and well-being.
We mainly design aids for the disabled, bedridden, and people with reduced mobility to try to solve real problems of people who live everyday life as a big challenge.
In addition, given the pandemic in progress, we design and produce 2 different types of surgical masks entirely Made in Italy.








 

At the beginning, the product was born with a clear purpose: to create a device that would allow people with reduced mobility, disabled, elderly or bedridden to brush their teeth independently and easily. 
But soon we realized that Cwash is much more: it is a product that everyone should have! 

There are many situations in which Cwash can be truly decisive, for example:
-Try to think about brushing your teeth while traveling by car or plane, with the classic toothbrush is unthinkable, with Cwash is easy!
-Have you ever tried brushing your teeth with a child in your arms? With Cwash you can do it easily and safely!
-And what about cleaning teeth during office hours? Use Cwash wherever you are and whenever you want and bring it always with you!

Cwash is small and extremely handy: it can be using by simply pressing the index finger on the power button. While with one hand you use Cwash, with the other you can do whatever you want: cooking, reading, working, traveling, relaxing and much more!
 

This campaign aims to cover the initial costs of industrialization, to make the product known around the world, to continue to implement Cwash and create special adds-on and allow users to buy it in the world premiere at a discounted price. 


 



Cwash has already passed all stages of testing so it is already ready for the market and the application is already on the Apple Store and on the Play Store. We estimate to ship all products to backers from a month after the end of the campaign. 

We believe a lot in trust and respect, for this reason, we assure all our Backers the maximum commitment and seriousness on our part.
As for the production we have already taken agreements with third parties to make us ready in any case, whatever the outcome of the campaign. 

In addition, we have already made agreements with distributors, prepared the packaging, instruction booklets, various spare parts, set up the production and assembly site within our production site to ensure greater quality, efficiency, and speed. 
We have already started to assemble the first devices, so you just have to buy yours and wait for the shipping arrival!

<h2>INTRODUCING MARLOW</h2>
<p>Marlow is launching the first lubricated tampon kit to allow for a smoother and more comfortable tampon insertion process, because why isn’t that already a thing?</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>OUR SOLUTION</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599362562/sl6nfjfdyducnwyxsqkj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We are producing menstrual products driven by real people's concerns, starting with the first-ever lubricated tampon experience.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our kit includes: </p>
<p>Organic <strong>lubricant reviewed by medical professionals</strong>, packaged in a sleek bottle engineered to perfectly coat the tampon in lubricant with each dip.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/fwzjL6c809TDbCB0JR/source.gif"" src=""""/></p>

<p><strong>18 organic cotton tampons</strong> (offered in light, regular, and super absorbency).   </p>
<p>                      <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/eNROC4vZZ0tRR5Z4Tm/source.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Together, this easy-to-use kit creates a smoother tampon insertion experience. The kit will be delivered straight to your door every month through an online subscription model (Note: all perks are a one-time order; the subscription service will be available in January via our website).</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Once we reached out to more medical professionals, we started to get some truly positive feedback:</p>

<p> </p>
<p>After collaborating with gynaecologists and other medical professionals, and delivering our kits to over 100 customers for product feedback, we are confident that our tampons will allow for a smoother and more comfortable insertion experience for everyone.</p>

<h3>Interviews </h3>
<p>Here's what we learnt: </p>
<p><strong>Almost everyone we spoke to had experienced some type of insertion pain or discomfort, but no one had any real way to deal with it.</strong></p>

<h3>Our Community</h3>
<p>We're working hard to disrupt the menstrual product space and transform the way we experience and talk about our periods. </p>
</div><div>
<p>After hundreds of conversations with menstruators, we recognized that not only was each person’s experience and relationship with their period unique, but that there was also a sense of solidarity and connection when we shared our own stories and traded tips. We found talking about our periods deepened our interpersonal connections and created a safe space for having other intimate and vulnerable conversations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>Some of the Conditions and Conversations Within Our Community</i></strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599359218/x1zgfm8hqbdgbyg9r7zg.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Over the last three months, Marlow has delivered prototypes to over 100 customers while simultaneously building a community of over 4700 followers through various social media platforms such as Instagram and TikTok. We also release weekly educational blog content on topics such as period poverty, menstruation in the media, and understanding our anatomy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/kcxRiFjT2zzNbw5t6M/source.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our goal is to reduce the stigma surrounding menstruation while educating our consumers about menstrual and sexual health. Through our platforms, we directly engage with our consumers to gather insights into their unique needs to determine where currently available products are falling short.  </p>
<p>We put the customer’s experience at the forefront of every decision we make, from the design of our tampons, aimed to provide a smoother insertion experience, to our convenient monthly subscription model. We are committed to addressing all of the problems we discover, one step at a time.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>The Team</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Marlow was born out of the belief that all those who menstruate deserve better than what is currently available to them. </strong></p>
<p>Our journey began back at the Ivey Business School with a candid conversation among friends. We casually shared period stories and discussed problems with our menstrual products. This was our “Aha!” moment: we realized we each felt that many of our needs were uncared for.</p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599248430/vkm6nlpgvro7puomqhqg.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>A messy table filled with products for our ideation session.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We wondered why on earth we had spent years <strong>perfecting our skin care routines, yet barely thought about our menstrual products</strong>?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This one initial question sent us into a spiral of discovery. We were<strong> far from the only ones to experience anxiety, discomfort, or even pain when inserting tampons</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We became aware of the <strong>overly-feminine branding</strong> in the menstrual industry. Not only did these brands not resonate with us, they <strong>weren’t inclusive </strong>of all menstruators.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We noticed ourselves <strong>hiding tampons</strong> in our sleeves on the way to the washroom—rushing in and out of the tampon aisle, <strong>embarrassed</strong> at the thought of being seen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We found ourselves lining our underwear with toilet paper again after<strong> running out of product </strong>at exactly the wrong time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We realized we rarely had open conversations about our needs, wants, concerns, and questions relating to menstruation. We were so uncomfortable broaching the subject that we instead disregarded our concerns and tolerated the bare minimum we were accustomed to receiving.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>And so Marlow was born.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Additional Information: Risks and Challenges</strong></p>
<p>We're here to help menstruators, so we're working diligently to prepare for any unforeseen risks and challenges. </p>
<p>Here are the risks we've identified so far, so that we're all on the same page:</p>
<p>MANUFACTURING &amp; PRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS: We've already been working hard with our product lead and biomedical engineer to develop our initial prototypes. As we've finalized these prototypes, we've selected a specific list of manufacturers that meet our criteria for manufacturing the lubricant and tampons in our kit.

<p>FULFILMENT: Sometimes things occur that can't be planned for, such as a pandemic. We currently expect to be able to ship to Canada and the US, although this will be subject to manufacturer capabilities, health regulations, and fulfilment centres capabilities.

If there are any bumps along the way, we'll always be sure to communicate them with you, while working hard to overcome them.</p>
<p>TIMELINE: While we've discussed our timeline in depth, certain factors are out of our control. Manufacturer lead times vary, and we want to ensure we can get our product to you in the safest way possible, which may take time.

</div></div>","INTRODUCING MARLOW
Marlow is launching the first lubricated tampon kit to allow for a smoother and more comfortable tampon insertion process, because why isn’t that already a thing?
 
OUR SOLUTION

We are producing menstrual products driven by real people's concerns, starting with the first-ever lubricated tampon experience.
 
Our kit includes: 
Organic lubricant reviewed by medical professionals, packaged in a sleek bottle engineered to perfectly coat the tampon in lubricant with each dip.
 

 
18 organic cotton tampons (offered in light, regular, and super absorbency).   
                      
 
Together, this easy-to-use kit creates a smoother tampon insertion experience. The kit will be delivered straight to your door every month through an online subscription model (Note: all perks are a one-time order; the subscription service will be available in January via our website).
 

 
Once we reached out to more medical professionals, we started to get some truly positive feedback:

 
After collaborating with gynaecologists and other medical professionals, and delivering our kits to over 100 customers for product feedback, we are confident that our tampons will allow for a smoother and more comfortable insertion experience for everyone.
 
Interviews 
Here's what we learnt: 
Almost everyone we spoke to had experienced some type of insertion pain or discomfort, but no one had any real way to deal with it.

 

 
Initial experiences with our kit showed fantastic results and made us realize - if all tampons were lubricated, would we ever go back to dry applicators?
 

 
Engineering the Product

We worked with our in-house biomedical engineer, Monika, to develop the drawings and specs for our product.

 
Getting the First Prototypes

Some images of our first prototypes.

 
Next Steps
So, what's next? Here's a look at our timeline so far:

 
Our Community
We're working hard to disrupt the menstrual product space and transform the way we experience and talk about our periods. 

After hundreds of conversations with menstruators, we recognized that not only was each person’s experience and relationship with their period unique, but that there was also a sense of solidarity and connection when we shared our own stories and traded tips. We found talking about our periods deepened our interpersonal connections and created a safe space for having other intimate and vulnerable conversations.
 
Some of the Conditions and Conversations Within Our Community

 
Over the last three months, Marlow has delivered prototypes to over 100 customers while simultaneously building a community of over 4700 followers through various social media platforms such as Instagram and TikTok. We also release weekly educational blog content on topics such as period poverty, menstruation in the media, and understanding our anatomy.
 

 
Our goal is to reduce the stigma surrounding menstruation while educating our consumers about menstrual and sexual health. Through our platforms, we directly engage with our consumers to gather insights into their unique needs to determine where currently available products are falling short.  
We put the customer’s experience at the forefront of every decision we make, from the design of our tampons, aimed to provide a smoother insertion experience, to our convenient monthly subscription model. We are committed to addressing all of the problems we discover, one step at a time.
 
The Team
Marlow was born out of the belief that all those who menstruate deserve better than what is currently available to them. 
Our journey began back at the Ivey Business School with a candid conversation among friends. We casually shared period stories and discussed problems with our menstrual products. This was our “Aha!” moment: we realized we each felt that many of our needs were uncared for.

A messy table filled with products for our ideation session.
 
We wondered why on earth we had spent years perfecting our skin care routines, yet barely thought about our menstrual products?
 
This one initial question sent us into a spiral of discovery. We were far from the only ones to experience anxiety, discomfort, or even pain when inserting tampons.
 
We became aware of the overly-feminine branding in the menstrual industry. Not only did these brands not resonate with us, they weren’t inclusive of all menstruators.
 
We noticed ourselves hiding tampons in our sleeves on the way to the washroom—rushing in and out of the tampon aisle, embarrassed at the thought of being seen.
 
We found ourselves lining our underwear with toilet paper again after running out of product at exactly the wrong time.
 
We realized we rarely had open conversations about our needs, wants, concerns, and questions relating to menstruation. We were so uncomfortable broaching the subject that we instead disregarded our concerns and tolerated the bare minimum we were accustomed to receiving.
 
And so Marlow was born.

 
Any pledge helps us reach our goal of making Marlow a reality. Click the ‘Back This Project’ button at the top of the page, or help us spread the word by sharing our page.
 
Thanks from all of us!

Additional Information: Risks and Challenges
We're here to help menstruators, so we're working diligently to prepare for any unforeseen risks and challenges. 
Here are the risks we've identified so far, so that we're all on the same page:
MANUFACTURING & PRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS: We've already been working hard with our product lead and biomedical engineer to develop our initial prototypes.

FULFILMENT: Sometimes things occur that can't be planned for, such as a pandemic. We currently expect to be able to ship to Canada and the US, although this will be subject to manufacturer capabilities, health regulations, and fulfilment centres capabilities. We're currently in contact with fulfilment centres with ample experience handling all these bumps and hurdles, so that we can get our products to you on time.

However, we've got a passionate team that understands our community's needs, and that keeps us driven to take each step closer to making this dream a reality.",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>We are here to fund and build the very first publicly available Disc Golf course in the Western Adirondack Area of NY! As most may have noticed Disc Golf is on the rise and was noted as the fastest growing sport in the US during 2020! The upstate region of NY has little to no courses available to the public and we want to bring the first state of the art 18 hole course to this area of Upstate, NY.</p>
<p>My name is Andy Padula PDGA #157804, I'm one of the Co-Designers of the soon to be               <strong>Ridge Runner DGC</strong>. Drew Shoup is the the other Co-Designer. We have been given the honor of creating a vision of being not only a first for the region but also creating a top-level disc golf course at Snow Ridge in Turin, NY. </p>
<p>This project is important to us as avid disc golfers as we want to help grow the sport to all communities to promote healthy living and show the world that sports don't need to be super expensive with a hard barrier to entry. Disc Golf is the peoples sport and here are some reasons to back that up:</p>
<p>Free to play at almost 98% of all courses worldwide.</p>
<p>Equipment is very cheap ranging from $10-$30 for discs</p>
<p>Tournaments provide revenue streams for local parks, business, etc.</p>
<p>The plan is to help under privilaged youth and people of all backgrounds pick up a healthy living hobby and enjoy community, nature, and sports all in one!</p>
<p>Your donations will help us achieve our dream of creating one of the top courses in NY while creating a destination for all disc golfers.</p>
<p>As we build/fundraise for this course we also want to use this platform as an opportunity to promote the first tournament that will happen at Ridge Runner DGC: <i><strong>The Lovely Open</strong></i> which will be held on July 10th in conjunction with <strong>A Lovely Time Music &amp; Arts Festival</strong> which runs July 9th &amp; 10th. This will be a non-sanctioned one round tournament for the first year. All those who sign up: <strong><a href=""https://www.discgolfscene.com/tournaments/The_Lovely_Open_2021/registration"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https:discgolfscene.com/tournaments/The_Lovely_Open_2021/register</a></strong><a href=""https://www.discgolfscene.com/tournaments/The_Lovely_Open_2021/registration"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong> </strong></a></p>
<p>will also get a 50% off Ticket to the festival if you want to make a weekend out of your trip to Snow Ridge! In total the cost to play will be $40 and if you opt to attend the festival your cost will be $80 including a dope players pack in addition for signing up!</p>

Store your weight plates on the power rack arms so they stay out of the way, folding in with the arms. When the bed is horizontal, they occupy space that you otherwise couldn’t use as it is behind the pivot point. These 50mm diameter brackets will hold all standard olympic weights with a diameter of 485mm (19”) or less. They should hold two large 20kg plates or more thinner plates. We don’t supply collars but any standard collars will work and you can ‘store’ your main collars here. These fit neatly into the lower power rack arm struts and are secured by a single bolt. The weight is kept low near the pivot, so even storing 80kg+ (combined) on them will have negligible impact on the force required to lift the bed to the vertical position.</p><p>NOTE: Price is for the pair, not each.

Under the bed, of course. But do you just want it lying on the floor/mat, or would it be better mounted to the bed frame, out of the way? That's what we thought, so we've come up with a simple solution using two strong rubber clamps and an additional steel bracket to act as a ledge to rest the bottom end of the barbell on. Mounting points will already exist on every PIVOT Power Rack, you'll just need to screw in a few supplied bolts. These can be mounted to either side of the bed, and can be flipped so they secure from left-to-right or right-to-left. Because the bottom of the barbell will pivot under the bed, into space which is otherwise wasted (under your pillow), you gain lots of space. With a UK/US king size (and both EU beds) you can fit a 2000mm (6'6"") barbell without it sticking out from the end of the bed when it's horizontal. Without it, just laying the bar on the floor/mat, you'll only have 1780mm (5'10"").</p><p>FITS: olympic (50mm/2"" diameter) ends or spinlock (25mm/1"") ends, Please specify when ordering.</p><p>INCLUDED: 2x strong rubber clamps, steel 'ledge' bracket, all mounting hardware.</p><p>NOTE: a standard olympic barbell measures 2200mm (7'2"") and the only way this can fit under any bed is diagonally. Your options are to place it diagonally on the floor/mat, upright in a stand, or mount it on your wall.</p><p> </p><h3>Foldable &amp; Adjustable Weights Bench: £699</h3><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616696662/ivqwxlwlijmm35owbqcb.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616696692/tdik8dqijnw0b3wr4i4w.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>The PIVOT Bench features a discreet bracket allowing the folded bench to be hung vertically on the wall when not in use.

</ul><p>An important note on maximum weight ratings:</p><p>This bench has been tested to well over 500kg, and with the way the British Safety Standard (BS EN ISO 20957-2013) works this means the manufacturer has rated it to 200kg total weight, including the user. This latter figure may not seem very much, but that's because the safety standard is very conservative. It states that the equipment must be able to hold 2.5x the maximum rated weight (200 x 2.5 = 500). You'll find countless examples of flimsy benches advertised as being rated to silly weights such as 363kg, which if true would mean that they would have to test it to 907.5kg. Please don't compare our honest figures with theirs. If you're likely to be placing large loads on a bench, please be careful with these ratings as most companies are not playing by the rules.</p><p>Dimensions (in millimetres):</p><ul>

It opens up your existing space – the size of a double or king-size bed – when you want to exercise, and returns to a comfortable bedroom when you want to sleep.   
No monthly fees: Wave goodbye to your gym membership
No travel: Eliminate travel time with a full gym in your home
No waiting: No more waiting in line or sharing equipment with others
No eyesore: The gym is well-hidden. When not in use you don't even know it's there 
No change: There's no impact to your existing bedroom
Storage: Finally, a single place to store all your exercise gear and equipment
Stay connected: Work out while you chat, work, play, watch, listen or learn by attaching virtually any device to the PIVOT® Bed
Strength training: You'll have a commercial-quality power rack in your home
Varied workouts: Most turbo trainers can be stored under the bed, as well as fold-down treadmills and rowing machines, facilitating a varied workout routine. We aim to partner with manufacturers to create versions of their equipment that will be verified as working with PIVOT®
Yoga, Pilates, barre: you've now got ample space to perform all kinds of exercise.
  The PIVOT® Bed is not a sofa-bed or flimsy wall-bed/Murphy-bed. It could well be the strongest bed ever made and perfectly accommodates a standard mattress, and it looks like a beautiful standard bed when in the horizontal sleeping position. Whether it's your main bed or in your guest room, you'll be proud to show it off.  PIVOT Bed 2021: the model featured in our promotional video was our initial prototype. Since our campaign was successfully funded on Kickstarter we've been able to employ a top UK design and engineering agency that has helped us refine PIVOT Bed's design into a much more sleek and sophisticated model. This now means that all of our past and future backers will receive our 2021 design or a model that is an enhanced and improved version of these new images.        

 
   Mattress sizesMeasurements relate to standard mattress sizes (not included) Note that terminology varies between regions, so a 'king-size bed' in most regions is called a 'queen' in North America.  We will contact all backers shortly after the campaign ends to take details of which bed size you need. PIVOT® Bed works with all standard mattresses which are 270mm thick or less. It will not work with super-thick 300mm+ mattresses. Bed frame dimensionsOur design review is almost complete and we'll have exact measurements posted here again very soon.In the meantime, if you add 150mm / 6"" to the length of your mattress and 205mm / 8"" to the width you will have a pretty close measurement.All backers are to choose from the above sizes shortly after the campaign ends. You will be contacted regarding your chosen bed size once we are ready for production. It is your responsibility to ensure your mattress will fit the PIVOT Bed you choose given the dimensions we've provided in the table above. This may involve you having to order a mattress from another country, so please be careful with this. We will NOT be making bespoke beds to your country's standard mattress sizes. A Note on Other Bed Sizes and The Future At some point in the future, we intend to design, engineer and produce a super-king version. As the super-king version introduces different engineering challenges we've had to exclude it for now, and we are not committed to producing this size. If demand is there, we will look into producing it.   Shouldn't quality be the first thing to consider when choosing a product, rather than price? What about the knowledge that vulnerable workers haven't been unethically treated? For us, they're the two main reasons for deciding to manufacture our product in the UK. We're only a short drive from our manufacturing partner, who we speak to virtually every day: sharing ideas, designs and feedback. Lots of feedback. PIVOT® uses:
Premium S355 grade steel
A2 Stainless steel for all our nuts, bolts and locking pins
Only PEFC/FSC certified wood
Powder coat rather than solvent-based paint
Solvent-free wood stain products
We will only use recycled & recyclable materials for packaging. 
 We're in control of our entire supply chain and are doing things the right way, from the start.  We use powerful 'gas struts' to take the strain from lifting and lowering the bed. They're easily adjustable if you need to fine-tune it to your mattress weight, for example.   Your safety is our priority and your PIVOT® Bed will be certified as safe by ensuring it passes everything related to BS EN ISO 20957-1 Stationary Training Equipment – General Safety Requirements and Test Methods. This is the international standard to which all Stationary Training Equipment – both Domestic (Class H - Home) and Commercial (Class S – Studio) should comply.  
The PIVOT Power rack slides left or right to be off-set from centre, creating space for strength training if the bed is positioned close to a side wall (see our website's blog page for more details)
Twin fold-out arms with unique telescoping 'feet'
75x75mm (3""x3"") 3mm (11 gauge) wall-thickness steel uprights
Westside hole spacing around the bench press area
16mm holes (5/8"") and stainless steel pins
Cross-brace doubles as an additional pull-up bar which can be set at any height
Everything laser-cut
Premium, textured powder coating matching the bed
Fits all standard barbells with 1200mm+ between the flanges
Depth ~500mm
Supplied with 2x J-hooks with UHMW plastic bar protection
   There are countless fitness/gym mat options around, but none actually solve the entire problem. They're generally just a set of smelly rubber tiles that move across your floor as you work out if you don't bond them to the floor. Are you ready to bond rubber mats to your bedroom floor? We didn't think so. Our solution is - firstly - to introduce a second, stiff layer, under the rubber mats. This is mainly aimed at protecting your flooring further by spreading the weight/impacts, but it also has the huge benefit of meaning your rubber tiles don't move around your piled carpet when you step on them. Our mat solution includes everything you need to have an amazing flooring solution to work out on, regardless of whether it is laid on a hard surface or carpet. We feel it's indispensable for exercising at home, but we'll leave that for you to decide.  The pull-up and dip bars will have a maximum rated user weight of 130kgs or more.The power rack uprights will be rated at 500kgs or more.Note that to pass the appropriate safety tests, the apparatus must be able to safely hold 2.5x the rated maximum user weight - so that's upwards of 325kgs for the pull-up and dip bars!   When upright, the bed frame extends to 2150mm above the flooring the product is set upon. You will need to take into account any mat which it sits upon (our own two-layer solution measures ~20mm).We have a simple system for adjusting the height of the pull-up bar, to accommodate different ceiling heights - and your own height! The maximum height achievable is 2.3m and the lowest at about 2m.NOTE: these measurements are for the UK king size bed. Please see the Available Bed Measurements section and adjust the measurements above based on the difference between your chosen bed size and the UK king size. For example, the UK double is 100mm shorter, so the minimum ceiling height is 2050mm, with the pull-up bars being adjustable from 1900mm to 2200mm.  Exercise videos, Zoom calls, virtual classes, or just catching up on some Netflix? All things we like to do when exercising, but it can be hard to find somewhere to set your device up so you can see it when exercising. Not with PIVOT® Bed, though, as you have masses of space to mount your screen or device. You can choose to use Velcro®, or use a system of your own. We recommend RAM Mounts and are in discussion with them to provide a system tailored for the PIVOT® Bed using their existing components.

The PIVOT Power Rack add-on

 You’ve given yourself the best possible start with the PIVOT Bed, now here are the additions to make your new gym fit your needs perfectly.If you'd like any of the below, please add up the total and add that amount to your existing pledge. Then message us to let us know which you want. If there are options, we'll take the details after we're funded - just like we will do for bed size, your address, etc.We'll add more as soon as we have figured out our cost prices (e.g, headboard), so please check back regularly. Safety Spotter Arms: £175 (pair)  If you’re going to lift heavy weights at home, make sure you don’t get stuck under them. Every power rack should have a pair of spotter arms and these follow a tried and tested design to perfectly fit the PIVOT Power Rack uprights. Made from the same 75x50mm 3mm wall steel as the rack itself, these won’t let you down. UHMW plastic protects your barbell knurling and the tough, textured powder coating is the same beautiful, premium look of the rest of the PIVOT kit. They will come with a pair of our 16mm (5/8"") diameter stainless steel, magnetic axial locking pins to ensure they don’t twist when you need them most.NOTE: Price is for the pair, not each. Weight Plate Storage: £60 (pair)  In any gym with limited space you’ll want to keep the floor space tidy. Store your weight plates on the power rack arms so they stay out of the way, folding in with the arms. When the bed is horizontal, they occupy space that you otherwise couldn’t use as it is behind the pivot point. These 50mm diameter brackets will hold all standard olympic weights with a diameter of 485mm (19”) or less. They should hold two large 20kg plates or more thinner plates. We don’t supply collars but any standard collars will work and you can ‘store’ your main collars here. These fit neatly into the lower power rack arm struts and are secured by a single bolt. The weight is kept low near the pivot, so even storing 80kg+ (combined) on them will have negligible impact on the force required to lift the bed to the vertical position.NOTE: Price is for the pair, not each. If you only want one, halve the amount and let us know. Impact-Resistant Polycarbonate Mirror: £80  Checking your form when strength training can be a real help. Our mirror add-on is made from 3mm thick polycarbonate, bonded to a thin layer of MDF to ensure an even, flat surface and great optical clarity. Polycarbonate is practically shatter resistant and much more so than the cheaper acrylic/Perspex® you’ll often find in gyms. The size of the mirror allows you to see your entire body and the mounting height is adjustable.NOTE: all mounting fixings included. Barbell Storage Solution: £50 PLEASE NOTE: The image above shows an earlier prototype and does not represent the PIVOT Bed that you will receive as a reward.  Where are you going to store your barbell? Under the bed, of course. But do you just want it lying on the floor/mat, or would it be better mounted to the bed frame, out of the way? That's what we thought, so we've come up with a simple solution using two strong rubber clamps and an additional steel bracket to act as a ledge to rest the bottom end of the barbell on. Mounting points will already exist on every PIVOT Power Rack, you'll just need to screw in a few supplied bolts. These can be mounted to either side of the bed, and can be flipped so they secure from left-to-right or right-to-left. Because the bottom of the barbell will pivot under the bed, into space which is otherwise wasted (under your pillow), you gain lots of space. With a UK/US king size (and both EU beds) you can fit a 2000mm (6'6"") barbell without it sticking out from the end of the bed when it's horizontal. Without it, just laying the bar on the floor/mat, you'll only have 1780mm (5'10"").FITS: olympic (50mm/2"" diameter) ends or spinlock (25mm/1"") ends, Please specify when ordering.INCLUDED: 2x strong rubber clamps, steel 'ledge' bracket, all mounting hardware.NOTE: a standard olympic barbell measures 2200mm (7'2"") and the only way this can fit under any bed is diagonally. Your options are to place it diagonally on the floor/mat, upright in a stand, or mount it on your wall. Foldable & Adjustable Weights Bench: £699  The PIVOT Bench features a discreet bracket allowing the folded bench to be hung vertically on the wall when not in use. Its 'flipper' folding feet ensure that when folded it takes up minimal space. Not only can it be hung on a wall, but it can also be placed flat on the floor and neatly fits under the PIVOT Bed, if you prefer to keep it out of view.Designed and manufactured in the UK by a team of talented engineers, we're confident this is the best foldable, FID bench on the market. Features:
Foldable down to 222mm high so fits horizontally under the PIVOT Bed perfectly
Comes with discreet wall mount allowing you to hang it flat on your wall
Backrest adjusts into 7 positions – 12° decline, flat, and 15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 75° incline
Adjustable seat angle
Tapered seat and backrest with 50mm firm foam padding
'Flipper' feet fold in and rotate to decrease footprint when not in use
Commercial quality and tested to commercial standards (100,000 repetitions)
Tested to well over 500kgs
200kg maximum *rated* load (user + weights)
32kgs weight
An important note on maximum weight ratings:This bench has been tested to well over 500kg, and with the way the British Safety Standard (BS EN ISO 20957-2013) works this means the manufacturer has rated it to 200kg total weight, including the user. This latter figure may not seem very much, but that's because the safety standard is very conservative. It states that the equipment must be able to hold 2.5x the maximum rated weight (200 x 2.5 = 500). You'll find countless examples of flimsy benches advertised as being rated to silly weights such as 363kg, which if true would mean that they would have to test it to 907.5kg. Please don't compare our honest figures with theirs. If you're likely to be placing large loads on a bench, please be careful with these ratings as most companies are not playing by the rules.Dimensions (in millimetres):

<h2>SEEUS95 SIZING: </h2>
<div>
<p>The masks come in three sizes: extra small, which spans 5 1/4"" to 6"" across the width of the face; small, which spans 5 3/4"" to 7"" across the width of the face; and large, which spans 6 1/4"" to 7 1/2"" across the width of the face. Note that the masks are able to stretch and fit to most face sizes thanks to silicone's flexible properties. For more information about mask sizes, please see the image in the campaign under the heading ""Why silicone?"" At the end of the campaign, we will send out a survey where you can specify which mask size you would like.</p>
<p>Silicone is very flexible and thus can adjust to many different ergonomic facial features and sizes. The silicone may be fitted to any size face as the silicone can be easily trimmed to your preference and shape. We also would not recommend this for children under the age of 6.</p>

<p>Silicone is durable, more ocean-friendly than plastic/air spun polypropylene. It lasts longer, and stands up better against heat and cold than plastics. Our masks can be sanitized with a simple alcohol wiping, soap and water, or put in the dishwasher, and even put in the microwave for 3 min (remember to remove the air filter first). During the recycling process, silicone reverts back into its harmless non-toxic ingredients: amorphous silica, carbon dioxide, and water vapor, unlike plastic and polycarbonates. Its amorphous quality makes it like a second skin, flexible so it can have an air seal fit to the contour of all different faces. Silicone has NO BPA: which is found in polycarbonates which can be harmful to humans, environment and the Oceans.</p>

<p>HOW DOES THE MASK STAY ON YOUR FACE?  Our proprietary sticky material: Skin Therapy Layer with skin rejuvenating Chitosan. PLUS, the Skin Therapy Layer does more than just adhere directly to your skin. There's the added benefit of Skin Therapy Layer healing power: silicone integrated with Chitosan is a natural vegan polymer used for skin healing in medical and beauty products, keeping skin protected, hydrated, healthy, and smooth.

You can get any regular temporary tattoo and apply it to the mask; jazz it up and add warrior tattoos to unique•ify, but still see your face and mouth so the hearing impaired can communicate with you.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have a great track record for delivery on our last crowdfunding campaigns. We have delivered over 900,000 of our first products world wide and so we have well seasoned experience in getting things made and delivered with our tremendous team of Light Warriors from the team in the US to the teams in other countries. From our last three campaigns, we have learned so much from you, our Kickstarter community, and for that we thank you. This time around, we’re pivoting to help with the New Normal which we believe is harming the environment, our skin, our social connection to each other, by covering our faces. We hold ourselves to incredibly high standards in terms of quality and experience. We won’t ship unless we are confident we have met or exceeded these standards. If an issue comes up along the way, we promise to be as transparent as possible while working towards a solution. YOU will be the first to know and be part of our team with information. Sustainability is at the core of SEEUS95's mission. We strive to use quality materials that will stand the test of time. Supply Chain: We don’t know what tomorrow might bring. As much as we try to plan for seeing around corners, things happen. Power goes out, the wrong parts are delivered, a pandemic spikes, machines and tools malfunction. We have full confidence in our manufacturing partners and supply chain but want to acknowledge that fact that an unforeseen circumstance could affect the time in which we are able to build the SEEUS95 products to the standard that we strive for. Shipping Risks: The world is as connected as ever, and we have worked really hard to make the shipping process as smooth as possible. That being said, forces outside of our control could arise, resulting in a shipping delay. We’re based in NYC. Our factories are in China and the USA, global crisis could happen, a fire could happen, who knows? Our main goal is to do right by our customers so that we can keep building innovative, sustainable products for you and the world. We Promise to keep you informed every step of the way, so you are the first to know about any delays or hiccups that may occur.</p>
<h2>Environmental Commitments + Long-Lasting Design</h2>
<p>Made from Silicone our products can be reused, washed, sanitized, and recycled. We will save billions of tons of PET/ Polypropylene mask waste by reusing our masks. We believe in materials that will not harm the environment Silicone has no BPA; Polycarbonate and PET (Polypropylene market leading N95masks and Surgical Masks) are non-recyclable masks and harmful to the ocean reefs if they end up in land fills. We pride our selves in our dedication to material sustainability that does no harm to ourselves, our families and the environment.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please share this campaign with your friends and family, the best way to contribute is through small acts of sharing our story and through collective community, of thoughtful and committed citizens, we can change the world, indeed it's the only thing that ever has. </p>
</div></div>","We thought it was high time someone re-visited the mask design, so we went to work. We researched materials, incorporated N95 bio-filters, and tested prototypes with our friends and family to bring you a mask that is comfortable, sustainable, and offers better protection than market-leading masks made from non-woven polypropylene or cloth. 
 



 



 




 
 
SEEUS95 SIZING: 

The masks come in three sizes: extra small, which spans 5 1/4"" to 6"" across the width of the face; small, which spans 5 3/4"" to 7"" across the width of the face; and large, which spans 6 1/4"" to 7 1/2"" across the width of the face. Note that the masks are able to stretch and fit to most face sizes thanks to silicone's flexible properties. For more information about mask sizes, please see the image in the campaign under the heading ""Why silicone?"" At the end of the campaign, we will send out a survey where you can specify which mask size you would like.
Silicone is very flexible and thus can adjust to many different ergonomic facial features and sizes. The silicone may be fitted to any size face as the silicone can be easily trimmed to your preference and shape. We also would not recommend this for children under the age of 6.




 

Silicone is durable, more ocean-friendly than plastic/air spun polypropylene. It lasts longer, and stands up better against heat and cold than plastics. Our masks can be sanitized with a simple alcohol wiping, soap and water, or put in the dishwasher, and even put in the microwave for 3 min (remember to remove the air filter first). During the recycling process, silicone reverts back into its harmless non-toxic ingredients: amorphous silica, carbon dioxide, and water vapor, unlike plastic and polycarbonates.

The supportive wings relieve pressure on your wrists and joints while increasing your grip strength.Transform everyday barbells, dumbbells, cable attachments and plate-loaded machines into kinesthetic thick bars that force you to use neglected muscles and create deep definition.Optimo Thick Grips’ contoured shape supports your grip unlike any other product. The anatomical wing grip gives you increased surface area for weight distribution, reducing strain on your joints and enabling you to lift more with less discomfort. When lifting weights, your hands support a lot of weight on the bars, placing high pressure on a relatively small grip area. In many cases, this causes irritation by pinching the extremely sensitive ulnar nerve that runs near the base of the palm by the pinky. When you increase weight, the sensation only gets worse. But not anymore.With Optimo Thick Grips, your hands stay neutral with the supportive wing cushions so you avoid imbalances and decrease strain on your fingers, wrists, elbows, and even shoulder joints!Work out harder, not longer. These 2.25” grips send your muscles into overdrive by increasing the demand on your hands and arms to give you higher quality reps. It’s the fastest and easiest way to increase strength and muscle mass while reducing discomfort when lifting.To get the same control that you’re used to on a thicker bar, you need to grip a lot harder. This additional force on your muscles targets your weak links that standard bars neglect.Optimo Thick Grips force your muscles to engage stronger than when you do the same exercise with a standard bar, effectively “turning on” the surrounding muscles.It’s all due to Sherrington's Law of Irradiation.Experience it for yourself with instruction from Russian Fitness Trainer, Pavel Tsatsouline:“Make a tight fist. Where do you feel the tension? Your forearm and biceps, right? Even tighter! White knuckles! Do you feel your shoulder and even chest flexing too? In reality, when the demand for force increases, other muscles jump in on the action. [...] Not by cheating, as some complement their barbell curls with a back swing, but by ‘cheering’.”Often grip and forearm strength are neglected, leading to an early top out point. When you increase the thickness of a weight-training implement, the demand placed on your hands and arms increases significantly.By working harder to grip the bar in the same exercises, you blast muscles that you typically overlook and consequently gain maximum, long-term strength. That’s why you can’t lift as much as you usually do when you start using Thick Grips—you’re finally engaging muscles that are smaller and weaker.Those finer, hard-to-engage muscles have no choice but to climb on board as you experience, tricep dips, bench presses and more for the first time.Increased contraction puts more strain on your joints and tendons, which is why Optimo Thick Grips have a patent pending ""ergonomic wing"" that gives you cushioned support for a safer, more comfortable grip.None of the other thick grip products on the market give you the additional support needed in a maximum force environment. They claim to be ergonomically designed but are just a standard cylinder, not naturally adapting to the shape of your hands.Optimo Grips are made of High Density Silicone, the toughest, impact-resistant silicone developed exclusively for Optimo.The UV-resistant material has no fillers and uses medical-grade white oil as the only plasticizer to meet the highest purity standards.Optimo Thick Grips were designed to fit the most common gym and home gym equipment. Their inside diameter is 1.1 inches (28 mm).Most commonly, the grips can be used on barbells, dumbbells, plate loaded machines and cable attachments. They will not work on equipment with curved handles.Before using Optimo Grips for the first time, get a feel for them in your hands. Test the right-handed grip in your right hand, so the winged area rests comfortably in your palm. The grips should feel comfortable when held correctly. Other grips on the market are interchangeable because there’s no specialized support for each hand. Each pair of Optimo Thick Grips has a customized Left and Right grip.Our thick bar grips are designed mainly for pressing and pushing movements. However, you’ll see improvement across all kinds of upper body exercises when training with Optimo, even if it’s not an exercise you use Thick Grips on.Typically you have to do more reps and sets to get noticeable enhancement, but with Thick Grips, you’ll immediately notice a major pump in your biceps and forearms.Increasing your grip instantly adds an edge to your workout. You’ll struggle doing the same exercises because the thick grip makes your muscles work double time without increasing reps or sets. Workout the same but see quicker results.Give your muscles a reason to build new tissue by making strategic changes to your training program.Using Optimo Thick Grips on approved movements increases your natural grip strength muscles and supports your wrists. This training makes you stronger for your lift and pull exercises so you can lift more and grip longer without destroying your form.Spare yourself from warts, pimples and other nasty bacteria growing on your hands from filthy gym equipment.

Why the ´recoverToes´ is good for YOU!Exercise such as running, hiking, an intense workout or just a long day on your feet, causes the muscles in your foot to fatigue, get sore and tighten up. The ´recoverToes´ recovery sandal has been biomechanically engineered to provide relief from these symptoms and decrease the risk of exercise related pain and injury.By wearing the ´recoverToes´ recovery sandal regularly (home, office, garden, gym, …) you can speed up foot recovery after running or after a long day on your feet and minimize foot soreness while fixing your foot function with every step you take in them.To be clear, however, these are not sandals that you are meant to wear while running. Rather, you should wear them only after a run.
THE SIMPLEST WAY TO FIX YOUR FOOT-PAINStudies show, that the muscular fatigue experienced after prolonged walking, exercise or running increases pressure on the forefoot and heel.The biggest influence on foot-pain is the shape and structure of the toebox of the footwear habitually used in training and daily life.CONVENTIONAL FOOTWEAR IS BAD FOR YOUR FEET:The ´recoverToes´recovery sandal helps your foot to rehabilitate from the negative effects of years of wearing conventional footwear.  It works like braces for the teeth: it puts your big toe into an optimal alignment and thereby slowly and progressively changes the structure of the foot while easing high-pressure points.  This will help the muscles to adapt accordingly and support positive effects on biomechanics, gait and injury prevention.*References below.__________________________________________________________________________________________MOST ADVANCED AND INNOVATIVE__________________________________________________________________________________________TOEFREEDOM®: Our secret Ingredient__________________________________________________________________________________________The ToeRite Technology  
(patent pending) Improve at your own paceWe usually spend decades in conventional footwear, that is too narrow at the front.  Our feet become shoe-shaped with squished toes that can no longer function naturally. The ToeRite technology (patent pending) works like braces for the teeth: it puts your big toe into an optimal alignment and thereby slowly and progressively changes the structure of the foot.  This will help the muscles to adapt accordingly and support positive effects on biomechanics, gait and injury prevention. The ´recoverToes´ can easily be customized by yourself to fit the unique situation of your feet. It automatically comes with three sizes of additional ToeRite clips (patent pending) that can be used to widen the ToeRite mechanism . We recommend you start wearing the ´recoverToes´ consistently and progressively without any of the additional clips at least for a period 3 months, before adding one of the additional clips. After that period, if needed, you can add the next size of clips to create a wider spread of the big toe. This will help to gradually re-align your big toe to its natural position and support the natural function of your big toe to anchor and stabilize the foot.Switching your ToeRite clips is easy:It´s very easy to switch between the three sizes of clips that come automatically with your ´recoverToes´.  They´re also easy to wash.____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Wear them anywhereHigh quality PU: water and moisture proof!__________________________________________________________________________________________Comparison and Specs____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Biomechanically validatedYour feet are in good handsThe ´recoverToes´ recovery sandal is brought to you from Germany with a combined know-how of over 50 years in footwear and biomechanics.

<h3>Our story &amp; team</h3>
<p>This journey started back in 2015, when the founders, Morten and Balder, decided that it was  time tDCS technology became widely available. Morten, a neurobiologist, and Balder, a product designer, have been friends and collaborators since they wrote their PhD’s together at Copenhagen Business School 10 years ago. </p>
<p>Today, the core team of PlatoScience includes a small but dedicated group of neuroscientists, engineers, developers, communicators and designers based in Copenhagen, Denmark. We are devoted to making neurostimulation easy and accessible to anyone, who wants to improve the way their brain works.<br/> </p>
<h3>Our vision</h3>
<p>To the ancient Greeks, a rich life was a life engaged in thinking: To be the best version of yourself was to be curious and strive to improve your mind. We named our company after one of the greatest thinkers of all time, because these ideals need to be made relevant again. PlatoWork is not just about enhancing cognitive performance. It’s about the gratifying experience of using your brain, the way it was intended. When we are fully absorbed in a task we are not just more efficient; we are in a state of flow – we are happy. Neurostimulation is a way to gradually take charge of your brain. It’s a tool for monotasking and a celebration of the things, we as humans are capable of when we insist, that our ability to think is what makes us who we are.</p>

<h3>Project risks and challenges</h3>
<p>We’ve done everything we could to ensure that the production runs smoothly. That's why we've decided to produce in small batches to avoid any problems with high volume productions. </p>
<p>Still the biggest risk-delimitation we’ve made, is to test PlatoWork among real users and continue to redesign the product based on their feedback.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Who can use PlatoWork?</h3>
<p>Anyone who is neurologically healthy, have normal skin and is more than 18 years of age can use the headset.</p>
<p>You cannot use the headset if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have a scalp or skin condition (e.g. psoriasis or eczema) as tDCS may aggravate the condition.</li>
<li>If you have a neurological disease or condition. tDCS responsiveness and current flow may differ due to the condition.</li>
<li>Have any metallic implants in your head, including intracranial electrodes, surgical clips, shrapnel or a pacemaker - but not including metal in the teeth and/or jaw. The reason is that metallic implants may change the current flow.</li>
<li>If you have any doubts, please consult your doctor before ordering.</li>

<p>Oscar, salesman, commercial sédentaire</p>
<p> </p>
<p>«I'm a medical assistant and I spend 7 to 8 hours sitting down. With the crowd coming at my desk I can't even get up more than twice a day. I feel my legs getting heavy, I put up some weight, I know it's not good for my health but what can I do ? My occupational doctor helped me improve my posture and my workstation's ergonomy, using magazines and an angled footrest. It's better but I'm still experiencing blood circulation issues. Since, I have tested Eveia for a month and I came to realize that my posture was less of an issue than inactivity. I did not want to return my eveia device back and have already preordered mine on Indiegogo. I can't wait for the delivery!   »</p>
<p>« Je suis secrétaire dans un cabinet médical, je passe 7 à 8 heures par jour assise. Avec l’affluence je ne me lève que 2 fois par jour environ, j’ai les jambes lourdes et j’ai pris du poids, je sais que ce n'est pas bon pour ma santé, mais que faire ? Avec les médecins du cabinet, nous avons travaillé la posture et l’installation au travail, et finalement nous avons bricolé une position avec des magazines et un repose pieds incliné, c’était mieux mais j’avais toujours des problèmes de circulation. Depuis j’ai testé Eveia pendant 1 mois et je me suis rendu compte que ce qui me faisait souffrir n’était pas la position d’installation mais plutôt l’inactivité. J’ai eu du mal à le rendre et ai déjà précommandé le mien sur Indiegogo, vivement la livraison ! » </p>

«I'm a medical assistant and I spend 7 to 8 hours sitting down. With the crowd coming at my desk I can't even get up more than twice a day. I feel my legs getting heavy, I put up some weight, I know it's not good for my health but what can I do ? My occupational doctor helped me improve my posture and my workstation's ergonomy, using magazines and an angled footrest. It's better but I'm still experiencing blood circulation issues. Since, I have tested Eveia for a month and I came to realize that my posture was less of an issue than inactivity. I did not want to return my eveia device back and have already preordered mine on Indiegogo. I can't wait for the delivery!   »
« Je suis secrétaire dans un cabinet médical, je passe 7 à 8 heures par jour assise. Avec l’affluence je ne me lève que 2 fois par jour environ, j’ai les jambes lourdes et j’ai pris du poids, je sais que ce n'est pas bon pour ma santé, mais que faire ? Avec les médecins du cabinet, nous avons travaillé la posture et l’installation au travail, et finalement nous avons bricolé une position avec des magazines et un repose pieds incliné, c’était mieux mais j’avais toujours des problèmes de circulation. Depuis j’ai testé Eveia pendant 1 mois et je me suis rendu compte que ce qui me faisait souffrir n’était pas la position d’installation mais plutôt l’inactivité. J’ai eu du mal à le rendre et ai déjà précommandé le mien sur Indiegogo, vivement la livraison ! »

I got scared, it's a bit like reading a medicine leaflet finally... And I decided to act.I first bought a watch activity tracker.I bought a big inflatable fitness ball, good for posture? Finally, I left it very quickly, uncomfortable to use.I also invested in an electric sit/stand desk from IKEA, more than 700€, I only use it standing up to draw from time to time, I unplugged it, and anyway, unusable all day, and in addition, we burn only 7% more calories than a sitting position.I tested the treadmill, too expensive, too noisy, it takes up too much space, abandoned.So I thought, okay, I'm an industrial designer, so I'll do it myself.And that is how the solution that you have before you was born.And the name? It is a contraction of the Ancient Greek ""EVEXIA"" which means well-being and health.So the circle is complete.It's your turn not to be sedentary anymore!  Je m’appelle Vincent Fourdrinier, je suis designer industriel depuis prêt de 20 ans.Un jour, en travaillant, je me suis posé la question concernant ma prise de poids récente.J’ai effectué des recherches, pour découvrir que je passais plus de 10h par jour en position assise et que je correspondais à la définition d’un sédentaire.Et quand j’ai découvert tous les effets de ce mode de vie….. j’ai pris peur, c’est un peu comme lire une notice de médicament finalement… Et j’ai décidé d’agir.J’ai d’abord acheté une montre trackeur d’activitéJ’ai acheté un gros ballon gonflable de fitness, bon pour la posture ? en tout cas, je l’ai abandonné très rapidement, inconfortable à l’usage.J’ai également investi dans un bureau électrique assis/debout de chez IKEA, plus de 700€, je ne l’utilise plus qu’en position debout pour dessiner de temps en temps, je l’ai débranché, et de toute façon, inutilisable toute la journée, et en plus, on ne brule que 7% de calories en plus qu’une position assise.J’ai testé le tapis de course, trop cher, trop bruyant, cela prend trop de place, abandonné.Alors, je me suis dit, ok, je suis designer industriel, alors je vais le faire moi-même.Et c’est comme cela qu’est née la solution que vous avez sous les yeux.Et le nom ?

</div></div>","Trainerbot is the world’s first app-enabled robot that is incredibly fun to play with. It can teach you how to play, give you a crazy workout, and most importantly, it can always practice with you when your friends are not around.  

  

 


""Trainerbot will push your ping-pong skills to the limit"" - USA Table Tennis
""I’ve played a fair amount of ping pong in my life and I like to think I’m pretty good, but last week a small plastic robot called Trainerbot pretty much wiped the floor with me."" - Technobaffolo
""Trainerbot is a new household robot that is almost guaranteed to be your toughest ping-pong opponent."" - arsTechnica


 

 

 
With Trainerbot, you can program any kind of game or sequence of shots so you can have fun and improve. Ever wonder how the athlete on TV missed that shot? You can program that famous match and try it for yourself. It’s the ultimate practice drill!

 

 
Trainerbot is totally customizable. You can adjust the difficulty up or down so games keep you on your toes.
 

 
Trainerbot shoots balls accurately to any part of the table. It accommodates any type of shot you want to work on - be they lobs, short shots, or smashes.

  


 
It's tough to find a perfect partner who can play a competitive game with you. With Trainerbot's multi-player mode, you can play with friends at different levels by programming varied sequences of shots.
 

 
Do you play ping pong with someone you can almost - but not quite - beat? Does this friend have an array of tricky spin shots that give them the edge? Trainerbot is your secret weapon! You can program your opponent’s trick shots and secretly practice at home (they won’t stand a chance).
 

 
In Video Learning Mode, you can watch a variety of ping pong tutorials, and then try out a corresponding pre-programmed session. Or, if you want to create your own video tutorial, simply link to your video on YouTube, program a shot sequence and share it with the Trainerbot community.
 

  

 
If you want to play a longer session, you can setup Trainerbot with any catch net in the market($30-40)! Catch net will collect most of the balls.

It holds your heel in the perfect position to safely, easily and effectively give you the world's deepest stretch.  No risk of injury — get complete leverage and a full stretch from heel to hip with CalfPRO’s clinically-proven, portable, patented design.  You're probably thinking, ""Why can't I just stretch on a wall?"" It's a valid question. The simple answer: a wall or curb just doesn't provide enough leverage to adequately stretch your calves.A slipping foot and insecure base makes it difficult to get the right angles, the correct fulcrum point and enough leverage for a deep, safe stretch.   Your calves require more than body weight to stretch as your calf muscle is part of a lever system (how else do you think your calf can lift your entire body weight at that compact size?). CalfPRO® gives you a deeper leveraged stretch with max torque by holding your heel in place acting as a fulcrum point — a wall or curb can’t do this.  Using a wall or curb also forcibly bends your toes and foot backwards and loads weight on your heel. This adds extra stress to an already inflamed Plantar Fascia and can lead to other foot injuries and problems.   
 

  Unlike other calf stretches and devices, the CalfPRO® doesn’t bend the toes backwards, supports your heel, provides a firm, non-slip base, gives unprecedented leverage, and can be used with shoes, socks, or barefoot when you need it most!     With CalfPRO®, you get a safer, deeper stretch effectively, easily, and without risk.  Maintain control and measure your results over time.       In only one use of CalfPRO®, you will notice an extreme sense of comfort and relief throughout your feet, calves, and hamstrings. The tension will dissipate away after each use and provide life-changing results to your overall health and wellbeing. Feel the relief of your freed calves!    Loosen your legs and even your lower back. CalfPRO® relieves tension in tired and tight calves, while lengthening them to make your feet feel lighter and let your legs and body move easier.   This process allows your body to move the way it’s supposed to and removes unnecessary stress on your feet, ankles, knees, hips, and back.    Nearly 8 out of 10 Americans have experienced foot pain. Those who suffer are also much more likely to have pain in their knees and back. When the calf muscles are tight they not only increase tension on the foot and ankle, they also change the mechanics of the knee and put stress on the hips and lower back.  As a result, tight calves can often lead to a myriad of foot, knee, hip and back conditions, like plantar fasciitis, heel bursitis, achilles tendinitis, and arthritis. Stretching your calves daily with the CalfPRO® only 30 seconds a day can help you reduce the risk of pathologies of the back and lower extremities even before they happen!  The majority of people with tight calves don’t even know their calves are tight. With CalfPRO®, you can accurately test your calf mobility and see your progress overtime! The test is simple. Place your foot on CalfPRO®. Pull yourself toward the wall, while keeping your leg straight. If you can’t touch your hip to the wall, you have tight calves!   The secret to getting a deeper, more relieving stretch is in the Heel Lock Design. The heel lock comfortably cradles your ankle at a perfect pivot point and sets your heel as an immovable fulcrum, so you can apply a controlled leveraged stretch.    The door frame is an excellent place to provide both the stabilization and leverage you need for a safe, effective calf stretch.The patented door jam groove ensures CalfPRO® is stable and locked in place as you stretch, while the door frame provides a place for you to grip and pull yourself in for a deeper stretch.   The heel pad is made of smooth, soft TPR foam to ensure maximum comfort while you stretch. Stretching has never felt so good!  CalfPRO® uses a special ABS Plastic that has the tensile strength of steel without the weight. It’s strong enough to carry 300+ lbs of weight, and light enough to take it with you anywhere!  CalfPRO® is fully collapsible, compact, and portable. Simply fold it in, stuff it in your bag, and you’re good to go! No more tight calves on your travels — get clinical grade stretching anywhere, anytime.  Keeping your calf muscles loose and limber helps reduce muscle soreness and your chance of injury. Flexible calves also ensure a full range of motion in your ankle and reduces stiffness in the Achilles prior to your next workout.   CalfPRO® isn’t just for athletes, it can be used every day by people who spend time on their feet at work, wear heels, struggle with body weight, suffer from calf cramps, or experience pain in the foot, heel, knee or back.  Nearly everyone has tight calves. This simple pain point can cause serious long term effects on your overall health. CalfPRO® is a simple, safe, and affordable solution. If you walk, sit, stand, or do anything with your feet during your day, CalfPRO® is made for you.   Your calves are amazing muscles built to support, carry, and move your entire body weight. They can easily become overworked, resulting in a complete degradation of your overall mobility.But when your calves are healthy, flexible, and mobile, you can experience mobility, movement, power, and balance in your lower body like nothing else!   With CalfPRO®, you can easily and effectively restore and maintain the health of your calves — letting you move freely, without worry. A global team of Certified Kickstarter & Indiegogo Experts.

<li><span style=""font-size:12px;""><strong>Standard Cooking</strong> — The default settings are set for most kind of rice; Long grain, medium grain, and short grain.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size:12px;""><strong>Customize Your Rice</strong> — Customize the settings according to your preference and taste. At default, the setting is 0.5 for both softness and moisture. For softness, the higher the number the softer is the rice. Conversely the lower the number the harder the rice. This is true for ‘moisture’ as well. The lower the number the drier the rice. Customization is may be necessary for a different type of rice e.g brown rice etc. </span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size:12px;""><strong>Customize Cooking </strong>— The default settings are set for most kind of rice; Long grain, medium grain, and short grain. </span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size:12px;""><strong>How To Soak </strong>— Rinse the rice and make sure the rice does not exceed the maximum level. Put the rice and strainer basket into the rice cooker, then add the exact amount of water. Please wait until the ‘completed’ sign appear and the water will then transude into the collection tray. The light indicator will turn to green.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size:12px;""><strong>How To Soak and Cook </strong>— ideal for various types of brown rice. It will soak to the time you set, and straight away continue cooking. It is also suitable for certain types of rice. You can set the time of soaking as long as you want and cooking will start upon completion of soaking time. </span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size:12px;""><strong>Washing Grayns </strong>— Remove the inner pot, steel ball, strainer &amp; starch collector from the rice cooker and wash them in warm, soapy water with a soft sponge. Rinse completely, then dry with a soft clean cloth. Any residue of vinegar or salt may cause your metal parts to corrode. Always clean thoroughly after each use.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size:12px;""><strong>Wet Wipe Only </strong>— To clean the heating plate and thermo-control plate, use a sponge and dishwashing soap to polish or remove any residue. Then wipe with a damp cloth. Allow drying completely before reusing. You must keep the heating plate and thermocontrol plate free from any foreign objects. Wipe clean to clear from any starch collected</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size:12px;""><strong>Cleaning Steam Vent </strong>— Take out the Steam Cover, wipe with a damp cloth the cover and the top of the steam ventilation lid to remove dirt and starch. </span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size:12px;""><strong>Cleaning Starch Collector </strong>— Pull out the Starch Collector from the rice cooker. Take out the Drain Cap and dispose of the starch collected. Handle with care, heat content may cause injury.</span></li>

 To be digestible rice has to be cooked, but when cooked in conventional rice cookers, rice becomes sugar and quickly spikes circulating blood sugar within half an hour, almost as fast as candy.The real problem with rice is something food scientists call Rapidly Digested Starch, which quickly breaks down into simple sugars and carbohydrates with a lot of RDS tend to have a high glycemic index which causes blood glucose to rise rapidly and stay high longer. The conventional rice cooker revolutionized how we cook rice, turning a once tedious and time-consuming process into something that is now simple and fast.However, what makes the home rice cooker convenient, also makes us much less healthy and adversely affects our health without us realizing it by leaving the unhealthy starch that's dissolved in the water to gets back into the rice.Not so with Grayns, its revolutionary technology automatically ensures better-tasting, longer-lasting, and healthier food using our proprietary 4-stage healthy cooking process called Revocook.    In a conventional rice cooker, the water is absorbed by the rice and the rest evaporates with no water drained away, leaving unhealthy starch to remain in the rice. Noting this fundamental problem and its adverse health effects, Grayns began developing an ingenious solution that scientifically and precisely cooks starchy foods with a four-stage process that removes the unhealthy starch water and lowers the glycemic index to doctor recommend levels suitable for a diabetic diet.Ingeniously invented by Yushitada Minami and commercialized by Toshiba in 1956, the home rice cooker became a trendy appliance revolutionizing the way we cook.Since its invention, many improvements have been made, such as making it a multi-function cooker, but the fundamental and problematic method for cooking rice has remained the same. Rice and water are put into the cooking bowl and boiled above 100°C until the water evaporates with all starches, including the unhealthy RDS remaining in the rice and ending up in our bodies.Grayns's patented 4-stage cooking process optimizes temperatures, moisture, and time to ensure excess, unhealthy Rapidly Digested Starch (RDS) is discarded.  Slowly gelatinizes rice at precise temperatures to release unhealthy, Rapidly Digested Starch into the water while still retaining nutrients. With the Grayns rice cooker, it doesn’t matter what type of rice you’re cooking because its Sensomatic Technology allows for the rice to cook at just the right gelatinization temperature depending on what type of rice or other starchy food that you are cooking. Holds the optimal gelatinization temperature, compelling most of the unhealthy Rapidly Digested Starch out of the rice. Just getting the temperature right isn’t enough, you’ve got to maintain this temperature to allow for all the unhealthy rapidly digestible starches (RDS) to debond from the rice and dissolve into the water while all the essential nutrients remain within the rice. Unhealthy Rapidly Digested Starch is transuded through the rice to be drained away into the Grayns starch collection tray underneath.Unlike the conventional rice cooker, the RevoCook technology doesn't allow for the water with all that unhealthy RDS back into the rice. With Grayn's ingenious REVO Intelligent Drainage System (RIDS), this water is drained from your rice, leaving you with healthier, naturally tasty rice that has a proven lower GI (Glycemic Index). Grayns de-moisturizes the excess healthy water from the healthy cooked rice to make it fluffy and delicious. The last stage of the RevoCook technology ensures that your healthier, better-tasting rice is also superior in texture. By removing the excess moisture or de-moisturizing your rice, these little grains become soft and fluffy – in other words, precisely, perfectly cooked rice.   With these simple tests, you’ll see how rice cooked in a conventional rice cooker is no different from the simple sugars often attributed to causing diseases such as diabetes. What’s more, you’ll see how Grayns rice differs from conventionally-cooked rice with lower glucose levels, better color, fluffier textures, and longer table life.  Lab Analysis & Blood Test Results: 
Update #3 - Blood Tests: 90% Substantially Lower Level
Update #2 - Lab Test Results: 35% Fewer Carbohydrates
 To conduct this test, simply cook a bowl of standard white rice using a traditional rice cooker and observe what color you see in the rice. The content of rapidly digestible starch or RDS causes cooked rice to take on a slightly yellowish tinge, which is what you’ll find with rice cooked in a conventional rice cooker. Why is this not good? As the term RDS implies, this starch gets broken down into simple sugars by the body and enters the bloodstream quickly, causing sugar spikes in the bloodstream. When this happens, the strain is placed on the body to cope with the sudden increase in blood sugar.On the other hand, because Grayns rice is low in RDS content, the rice you get is plain white. Grayns rice is high in slowly digestible starch or SDS, which, when digested, gets released slowly and gradually into the bloodstream, causing no strain on the body’s blood sugar level control mechanism. To conduct this test, you'll need to consume standard cooked and Grayns cooked rice to observe your Blood Glucose readings.Rice cooked in a conventional cooker has an extremely high glycemic index as the sugar in rice stays back in, causing your blood glucose to rise quickly and stay high longer. The glycemic index (GI) is the rate at which a carbohydrate is converted into sugar and absorbed into the blood system to trigger high blood sugar which in turn makes the body to react to produce insulin. Rice cooked in the Grayns Rice Cooker is 30 to 35 percent lower on the Glycemic Index; hence, blood glucose levels never spike to dangerous levels and fall back to normal very soon. To conduct this test, simply take a spoonful of cooked rice and chew on it for roughly 5 minutes to observe how the rice tastes.The high rapidly digestible starch in conventionally-cooked rice makes it sweet after a few minutes of chewing. On the contrary, chewing on Grayns rice for as long as you can don’t change the taste of the rice – it stays neutral in flavor, bringing out perfectly the characteristics of other foods eaten together with rice. Just the way it was initially intended to be. To conduct this test, have a regular meal of conventionally cooked rice and Grayns cooked rice on different days to see how feel? When you eat conventionally-cooked rice, the starch is rapidly digested into your bloodstream, causing you to feel full almost immediately after eating. Once the body’s blood sugar control mechanism kicks in and the sugar levels in the bloodstream dip, you’ll start to feel hungry again. This isn’t true with Grayns cooked rice because it isn’t high in rapidly digestible starch or RDS but rich in just the opposite, slowly digestible starch or SDS. So while your hunger might not get instantly gratified eating Grayns rice, you will feel full and have higher energy levels for longer as the starch from the rice is gradually digested and slowly released into your bloodstream. To conduct this test, leave a bowl of rice Grayns cooked and conventional rice to sit out at room temperature for 24 hours.  Conventionally-cooked rice, if left in room temperature will go bad after about 24 hours and will start to give off a very distinct smell. The reason for this is the fermentation of the rapidly digestible starch and is also why we sometimes feel bulky and uncomfortable after we’ve eaten conventionally-cooked rice. Grayns rice with its low RDS content, however, doesn’t have this problem and not that you should, but you can leave a bowl of Grayns rice in room temperature for up to 5 days, and it’s still good.    Check out the latest Grayns news:
