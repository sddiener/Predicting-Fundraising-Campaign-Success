<br/>
<p>For the past 5 months we have worked really hard, developing Plugzee, perfecting design and functionality. Our main goal was to make a device that is simple and efficient, intuitive and user-friendly. We have taken care of the tiniest details, from adding an oleophobic coating, to including a microphone to seamlessly answer calls.<br/></p>

<p></p>
<p>After several iterations, and extensive prototyping, we think we have a device that will blow your socks off!</p>
<p>A device with crystal clear sound delivery and no loss in quality, so you can hear every note. Never again worry about acoustics. You need to try it to believe it.</p>

<p>After many a sleepless night, and pots of coffee, we have a prototype that is ready to be launched. A device that will win you over as soon as you hold it.<br/></p>
<p>Through Indiegogo, we look forward not only to raising funds, but also towards creating an Early Adopters Community that will help us get the product to the market. In return, you will receive a Plugzee at a special price.<br/></p>
<p>It is time to descend from the lofty generalities of CDs and pen drives. Be part of the campaign and make the Plugzee community grow. Let's change the way we play our music!<br/></p>

</div></div>","Imagine filling your living room with music, streaming your favorite music from your Smartphone or Laptop to your home stereo system.
How about answering calls, or giving Siri a shoutout while driving? Don't have a bluetooth enabled stereo system? No problem, Plugzee has got you covered!A tiny little device that turns any audio speaker into a Bluetooth speaker without compromising on its audio quality.
Pair your Smartphone, Tablet or any other Bluetooth-enabled device with Plugzee and stream your music wirelessly.

Plugzee uses low complexity sub-band coding and aptX codec for compression which streams music over Bluetooth in a lossless manner, without any change in the original quality of the song you are playing i.e. CD quality sound over Bluetooth.












Plugzee uses a power efficient Bluetooth 4.0 LE module that lets you seamlessly pair any generation Bluetooth device with the press of a button. The AptX streaming lets you stream high-resolution music over Bluetooth.
 Plugzee boasts a range of 33 feet and pairs with up to 8 devices.



Plugzee can be hooked up with any speaker that has a 3.5mm audio jack, from a Boombox or Home Theater System. No more constant plugging of your Smartphone, Tablet or Laptop into an AUX cable.





Plugzee comes with a Micro USB charging port and can be charged from any existing USB outlet, eliminating the need for special cables and chargers.




Don’t take your hands off the wheel while driving; with the built-in noise cancellation microphone effortlessly answer your calls over loudspeaker or take control of your phone by with a shout out to Siri or Google Voice Search.



Plugzee comes with a Lithium-ion battery that lets you stream music for up to 18 hours on a single charge with a standy-by time of 30 days. The device also comes with an over-current protection circuit which lets you use a charger with any Amperage. 




Be it an iPhone, iPad, Nexus, Sony, Nokia or even a Laptop, never again worry about compatibility issues. Plugzee is compatible with every Bluetooth enabled device you will ever use.









We believe design is so much more than just the way something looks, it's the way something actually works, on so many different levels.


For the past 5 months we have worked really hard, developing Plugzee, perfecting design and functionality. Our main goal was to make a device that is simple and efficient, intuitive and user-friendly. We have taken care of the tiniest details, from adding an oleophobic coating, to including a microphone to seamlessly answer calls.



After several iterations, and extensive prototyping, we think we have a device that will blow your socks off!
A device with crystal clear sound delivery and no loss in quality, so you can hear every note. Never again worry about acoustics. You need to try it to believe it.






After many a sleepless night, and pots of coffee, we have a prototype that is ready to be launched. A device that will win you over as soon as you hold it.
Through Indiegogo, we look forward not only to raising funds, but also towards creating an Early Adopters Community that will help us get the product to the market. In return, you will receive a Plugzee at a special price.
It is time to descend from the lofty generalities of CDs and pen drives. Be part of the campaign and make the Plugzee community grow. Let's change the way we play our music!


























The past few months have been really challenging to us, but we have accomplished quite a bit. We are very excited to bring Plugzee to the market as soon as possible.

Our goal with the all-new SonaBuds 2 Pro is to engineer a full-sized headphone listening experience into true wireless earbuds with the lightest, smallest earbud enclosure and the longest-lasting battery life on the market. SonaBuds 2 Pro delivers incredible 15 hours of music play time on a single charge with 20% smaller earbud size than the first generation SonaBuds. And the handy charging case provides 74 hours of total battery life. We shrunk the most of it.So we can squeeze more performance out of it.We have meticulously designed and shrunk most of the components inside SonaBuds 2 Pro to fit them in an incrediblely small and light earbud enclosure. We chose powerful and efficient Qualcomm Bluetooth 5.0 chipset and optimized our circuit design to draw as little power as possible. Thanks to the optimized antenna design and all other minimized components, there is plenty of room for big battery to support longer music play time. Now you can listen to your tunes or watch your Netflix movies for 15 hours without recharging.  Never run out of battery again.Up to 74 hours of battery life.Fast recharging.SonaBuds 2 Pro provide amazing 15 hours play time on a single charge. If you ever ran out of juice and need a quick top up, no problem. With our fast recharging design, you get three hours of play time from a quick 15-minute recharge and fully top up the power in just 1.5 hours. Good things come in pairs.We've worked extensively with both Qualcomm and Realtek to utilize their latest technologies in RF fields. We picked the equally impressive Realtek's latest Bluetooth 5.0 chipset to power SonaBuds 2, so you can enjoy the long-lasting music listening experience at an even more affordable price. We have meticulously engineered the earbud's mechanical structure so these two excellent chipsets can fit into the same minimalist earbud enclosure. Here's a quick comparison between SonaBuds 2 Pro and SonaBuds 2. They are identical in every way except for the Bluetooth chipset we put in. Compare SonaBuds models RewardsLatest Bluetooth 5.0 technology.Performance meets efficiency.SonaBuds 2 Pro is powered by the latest-generation Qualcomm Bluetooth 5.0 chipset. This ultra-efficient architecture draws very little power from the system. Combining this efficiency with our robust antenna design, SonaBuds 2 Pro delivers high performance which means you can keep enjoying your music longer without any interruptions. Wirelessly. Unbreakable connection.The definition of robustness.A lot of engineering efforts were put into the development of SonaBuds 2 Pro antenna design. With our robust custom antenna design, we developed SonaBuds 2 Pro to maintain stable connection to the Bluetooth-enabled device within 35 ft (10m) and the bond between the left and right earbuds, so you don't experience any music breakups, drop calls, or any signal loss. Our efficient custom antenna design increases signal reception while maintaining very low power consumption draw from the battery, so you can keep your playlists on repeat without recharging. We ran tests on real-world usage scenarios with SonaBuds 2 Pro. We tested with Bluetooth phones inside the front pockets / back packets of jeans, inside a bag while carrying on different sides, inside a backpack while carrying on the back. We tested countless scenarios that you could possibly imagine to ensure you could enjoy your music without any interruptions. Enjoy with peace of mind.SonaBuds 2 Pro is IPX6 rated water resistant, so these earbuds are weather-proof, rainproof, and splash-proof. You can rest assure that the next time you go out for a run, the drizzle and the sweat are not going to slow down your workout. Intuitive touch controls.No more annoying clicking sounds in your ears when changing tracks. We use advanced touch-sensor control system in SonaBuds 2 Pro. Take, make calls and also pause, play and adjust the volume of your music, wake up Siri or Google Assistant with simple taps. Dual-Channel Stereo CallAll ears for your phone conversation.Mono calling was one of the common limitations of earlier generations true wireless earbuds. It's uncomfortable when only one earbud has sound when talking on the phone. We've worked and overcome this limitation by efficiently utilizing the bandwidth provided by the latest Bluetooth 5.0 technology. Now you can listen to your phone conversations in both ears! Secure and ergonomic fit.Perfect isolation. Perfect sound.

Oftentimes, it is only when one is already suffering that he or she begins to consider any mental health or self-growth activities.  Ultimately, by not taking care, 
not ""sharpening one's own axe,"" our lives are adversely affected in many ways.  We begin to feel depleted and notice that we are becoming less

has been introducing the benefits of meditation, guided imagery and relaxation
exercises to my clients for many years, I have discovered that there is a need
for me to make my own recordings rather than try to use those that are already available. My work with sound healing and recording my own meditations and
exercises for my clients has come as the result of many direct requests to
create something different. Firstly, since my clients trust me, they prefer my
intentions and cultural sensitivity.  Many
of my clients have told me they would prefer to listen to meditations and
relaxation recordings that do not have any Eastern religious or philosophical
implications.  In my research,
 I found the most important qualities necessary for a high quality, 
effective production, would be a 
well-engineered recording which includes no undesirable elements such 
as: background noise, poor acoustics, excessive jargon, etc.  In 
developing this album, I have needed to be mindful to use a speaking voice 
which is free of dialect or accent and to speak in a tone of voice which is easy to listen to and to relax with,   Additionally, these recordings are free from any religious
 elements, and have been developed with scientific principles and 
techniques. Any added music or sound elements are purposely chosen to 
enhance the listening 
experience.  As a matter of fact, research states that the effect of 
healing audio can be increased by up to 30% when embedded with various 
additional elements such as nature sounds, binaural beats, singing 
bowls, etc. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/586890/files/20140518034443-Picture10.png?1400409883"" src="""" style=""width: 550.613px; height: 89px;""/></p><i>For all these </i>reasons and

are many ways to utilize sound for change with the use of singing, nature
sounds,and instruments, such as crystal bowls, didgeridoos, and tuning forks. Today,
drumming is widely used to release stress and build team consciousness. Sound
is being used by clinical psychologists to help their patients combat anxiety,
improve sleep, and enhance their creative expression. Music with sound healing principles embedded (such as binural beats), can be used to entrain the brain into specific states of consciousness. The
medical community is also beginning to use sound and music to relax their
patients and relieve their pain during and after surgery, to break up
gallstones and other blockages and to ""vibrate"" vital organs back
into a healthy state.  One example of this is oncologist Dr. Mitchell Gaynor who uses sound healing to assist his  patients in their healing process.

available through such audios and sound healing in general.  Certain recordings can induce or entrain the

Oftentimes, it is only when one is already suffering that he or she begins to consider any mental health or self-growth activities.  Ultimately, by not taking care, 
not ""sharpening one's own axe,"" our lives are adversely affected in many ways.  We begin to feel depleted and notice that we are becoming less 
time and energy efficient than we could optimally be.  For the past 15 years I have been developing relaxation recordings for my clients and students, but doing them informally, on my laptop (or previously, more antiquated equipment).  As a musician and a therapist, however, I know that even better quality can enhance the efficacy of the recordings.As a psychotherapist who
has been introducing the benefits of meditation, guided imagery and relaxation
exercises to my clients for many years, I have discovered that there is a need
for me to make my own recordings rather than try to use those that are already available. My work with sound healing and recording my own meditations and
exercises for my clients has come as the result of many direct requests to
create something different. Firstly, since my clients trust me, they prefer my
intentions and cultural sensitivity.  Many
of my clients have told me they would prefer to listen to meditations and
relaxation recordings that do not have any Eastern religious or philosophical
implications.  In my research,
 I found the most important qualities necessary for a high quality, 
effective production, would be a 
well-engineered recording which includes no undesirable elements such 
as: background noise, poor acoustics, excessive jargon, etc.  In 
developing this album, I have needed to be mindful to use a speaking voice 
which is free of dialect or accent and to speak in a tone of voice which is easy to listen to and to relax with,   Additionally, these recordings are free from any religious
 elements, and have been developed with scientific principles and 
techniques. Any added music or sound elements are purposely chosen to 
enhance the listening 
experience.  As a matter of fact, research states that the effect of 
healing audio can be increased by up to 30% when embedded with various 
additional elements such as nature sounds, binaural beats, singing 
bowls, etc. For all these reasons and
more, I believe this carefully researched, engineered album must come out for
the benefit of the public.  Please allow me to help you attain some relaxation and peace of mind. I would even be happy to assist you in meeting some  previously unmet goals and aspirations. 
Join me in my Indiegogo Campaign. 
With a one time financial investment  in this project,  the benefits you will accrue will show a long term, continuous and positive yield. 
The skills and techniques you will learn will be lifelong!  By just listening to these recordings daily or as needed, you will find very rapid improvements in various areas of your life such as improved mood, increased energy, enhanced immune response, diminished anxiety, diminished blood pressure and other heart ailments, and more!There
are many ways to utilize sound for change with the use of singing, nature
sounds,and instruments, such as crystal bowls, didgeridoos, and tuning forks. Today,
drumming is widely used to release stress and build team consciousness. Sound
is being used by clinical psychologists to help their patients combat anxiety,
improve sleep, and enhance their creative expression. Music with sound healing principles embedded (such as binural beats), can be used to entrain the brain into specific states of consciousness. The
medical community is also beginning to use sound and music to relax their
patients and relieve their pain during and after surgery, to break up
gallstones and other blockages and to ""vibrate"" vital organs back
into a healthy state.  One example of this is oncologist Dr. Mitchell Gaynor who uses sound healing to assist his  patients in their healing process. (http://gaynoroncology.com/services/mind-body-spirit/#sound_healing).By engaging in very simple
exercises and techniques, one can experience reduced stress and anxiety.  Additionally, there is often a dramatic and
visible effect on one’s resilience on all levels - body, mind and spirit.  This is an enjoyable, economical and portable way for anyone, of any cultural
or religious background, to find simple, affordable, drug free* strategies to
reduce stress, strengthen the immune system, lower the risk of heart attack and other heart ailments, and improve overall well being. Additionally, many other benefits are
available through such audios and sound healing in general.  Certain recordings can induce or entrain the
brain to various brainwave states for experiences other than relaxation.  For instance: audio can help a person become
more alert or focused.  Additionally, by
developing skills, individuals can improve their memory, test taking, reaction
time or diminish pain*, etc.* Healing audios are not a substitute for proper medical or attentionRelaxation - Using Beach Scene and Forest and Stream Imagery. In these 2 exercises you will experience a vacation
that you will see in your mind and experience in your body, right from the
comfort of your own living room or bedroom. Through your imagination, you will
be transported to a place that is safe and serene and experience sensations
through all of your five senses. As this is practiced regularly, and the ""safe place"" becomes more vivid and familiar, you will be able to induce the same relaxation at will, even when not listening to the recording!  You will emerge relaxed and refreshed. 
Meditation - This is an attentional exercise where you will learn to 'check in' with each part of
your body...part by part, just calling attention to and becoming aware of any tension and places you may be ""holding"" tightly. Just by becoming more aware, we can eliminate the negative effect that tension has on our body and mind.  This exercise is great for anyone with nervous tension, teeth grinding, sleep disorders* of various kinds, and for those who are not ""in touch with their body"" as they feel they should be.  

Relaxation - Similar to the Body Scan, this exercise introduced by Edmund Jacobson in the 1920's, takes us gradually through the body.  However, in this one, the participant is far more active during the recording, being asked to intentionally tense up, hold, and then release each area of the body, part by part. This exercise can induce deep relaxation of the body. Meditation - A Children’s Meditation as well as 1, 3, 5, 7 & 10 versions- These are of the most basic meditation practice where the focal attention point is one's breath.  These exercises progress from 1 minute to 10 minutes.  As the individual develops greater skill with repetition and practice, longer meditations can be used to augment the beneficial effects. Doing one of these daily ""in the background"" as if you were taking supplements to maintain a healthy body, will help you gain the most benefit.  When necessary, either to calm down or to prepare for an event, these ""spaces"" can be utilized in the moment as well. This is an advanced, unguided meditation on breath, body sensation, image or sound.  Since this a more advanced practice, the participant should be familiar and comfortable with the shorter meditations above before doing it.  The individual is introduced to the already familiar meditation ""effort"" at the very beginning of the recording, but then is left to do it on his/her own for the remainder of the time.   The listener will be taught different relaxation exercises utilizing various breathing techniques.  These will utilize some of the principles of ""The Relaxation Response"" of Dr. Herbert Benson and others. http://www.relaxationresponse.orgThese exercises are so simple, they can be used ""right out of the box.""  However, the listener may have questions regarding how they should best be done.  These simple instructions will help listeners maximize their benefit from this album.*The album many contain additional recordings.Any
investor donating $1000 or more will receive a custom developed guided  meditation or healing recording specifically developed for
the area of need, or industry.  Such recipients might include: doctors, dentists, chiropractors, therapists, nutritionists, doulas, etc.  Each donor will also receive all other perks as well.  The custom recording will be individually scheduled for production.   Prior to creation, donor will
need to supply ample information for development of the recording.   At this time, it would be estimated that the donor receive custom recording 60 days after information is supplied.  Additionally, if requested, their names will be featured on the album as sponsors.

relaxation audios with care.*  To get the
fullest therapeutic effect, please use headphones, earbuds, earphones, etc.,

Where the SOUNDPEATS H1 shines the most is its sound quality, which beats other competitors in nearly every category: highest-performing hybrid dual-driver system, most advanced Bluetooth chipset, adaptive compression algorithm and professional acoustic tuning, just to name a few. It sounds as good as TWS earbuds two or three times the price, and even rivals wired earbuds.   Be prepared to have your ears sharpened, eyes opened, and mind blown by SOUNDPEATS H1’s excellent audio performance. Not all earphones are created equal. We make SOUNDPEATS H1 for people who share values with us when defining a pair of GOOD earphones - they need to sound GOOD, with no distortions in the treble and no rattles in the bass, rendering the music in a harmonious fashion that satisfies the soul.We went to great lengths to deliver the perfect sound to you while keeping them in a reasonable price range. The magic formula of SOUNDPEAT H1 is its unique driver system - a combination of a Knowles balanced armature driver, a customized dynamic driver, and a patented crossover.

Our hardcore and successful product lineups, TrueShift, TrueWings, TruEngine, Truebuds, etc. have all been very well received and regarded by our customers.  The release of the SOUNDPEATS H1 follows the successful launch of the SOUNDPEATS Truengine 2 on Kickstarter.  Raising over $350,000 from backers worldwide, SOUNDPEATS has built a world-class reputation for high-quality headphone construction and sound quality.   SOUNDPEATS H1, our latest model of TWS earbuds, debuts on Kickstarter as the conclusion of many great ideas and concepts. However, they were all centered around one single subject when we were designing it, and that was YOU, our most valuable customer. That is why we utilized nothing but the best components and technologies: the Knowles balanced armature driver, oversized titanium dynamic driver, Qualcomm’s latest flagship Bluetooth chipset, adaptive compression algorithm, professional acoustic tuning and ergonomic design. We created it with the confidence that you could wear and hear its sounds not only with satisfaction, but with amazement at its quality and comfort. We pledge to continue relentlessly pursuing innovative and better solutions for you than anything that’s come before!",55.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h4>USB Microphone with Focused Pattern Technology™</h4>
<br/>
<h3>Who is Samson?</h3>
<p>Samson has spent over 35 years creating high-value, innovative audio products for both professional and consumer markets in live, studio and business environments. 11 years ago Samson developed the world's first Professional USB Microphone, the C01U, providing multimedia creators an instant upgrade to computer audio quality and convenience</p>
<br/>
<h3>Connect. Communicate. Create.</h3>
<p>Go Mic Connect applies user-adjustable Focused Pattern Technology to Create superior digital Communication and computer recordings in even the noisiest office and mobile recording environments.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458054406/oxzgwaafpiqd501wvain.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<h3>Focused Pattern Technology™ and <br/>
    Digital Noise Reduction </h3>
<p>Samson’s <b>Focused Pattern Technology™</b> enhances pickup pattern directionality to better target the audio directly in front of the microphone. When activated, all sound that originates outside the focus area is significantly reduced, making the Go Mic Connect ideal for noisy environment communications.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://samsontech.s3.amazonaws.com/images/focus-patterns-animation.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The <b>Digital Noise Reduction </b>algorithm improves your
speech articulation by reducing ambient noise in your environment such as
computer fans and air conditioners. Continuous and repetitive noise is
effectively removed from the microphone input, providing cleaner audio for
speech recognition, videoconferencing, gaming, and voice over internet
communication.</p>

USB Microphone with Focused Pattern Technology™

Who is Samson?
Samson has spent over 35 years creating high-value, innovative audio products for both professional and consumer markets in live, studio and business environments. 11 years ago Samson developed the world's first Professional USB Microphone, the C01U, providing multimedia creators an instant upgrade to computer audio quality and convenience

Connect. Communicate. Create.
Go Mic Connect applies user-adjustable Focused Pattern Technology to Create superior digital Communication and computer recordings in even the noisiest office and mobile recording environments.


Focused Pattern Technology™ and 
    Digital Noise Reduction 
Samson’s Focused Pattern Technology™ enhances pickup pattern directionality to better target the audio directly in front of the microphone. When activated, all sound that originates outside the focus area is significantly reduced, making the Go Mic Connect ideal for noisy environment communications.

The Digital Noise Reduction algorithm improves your
speech articulation by reducing ambient noise in your environment such as
computer fans and air conditioners. Continuous and repetitive noise is
effectively removed from the microphone input, providing cleaner audio for
speech recognition, videoconferencing, gaming, and voice over internet
communication.

</div></div>","As music lovers, we are always looking for ways to make our listening experience better. Imagine what it would feel like to be able to take full control of your music player with a simple wave of your hand.
That's why we made AIUR, a Hi-fi speaker that can recognize up to 8 types of hand gestures giving you the freedom to control the speaker on all the functions.

 

AIUR brings you an incredible freedom to control music with simply waving hands, adjust the volume, switch tunes, pair to new devices, and many more. We do not want just make AIUR a speaker, but a tool to connect you to music without any physical barriers.


 

 
The complex pattern recognition algorithms embedded in the software, combined with a high tech 15mm sensor module, allow the AIUR to detect over 8 types of hand movements & gestures up to a range of 11 inches. Features such as changing the songs, adjusting the volume, Play & Pause and track control makes AIUR the most versatile and useful gesture control speaker available today.
Which emits the special infrared light, receives reflected a light wave, and restructures the 3D model of your hand. By analyzing different gestures, the sensor module transforms them into orders to take full control of all functions of AIUR.

 



Sensurround Hi-Fi Sound Effect
Designed to the highest acoustic standards, AIUR’s compact audio circuit design creates a highly-tuned acoustic chamber space for the very best sound quality – allowing the dual speakers and bass amplifier to deliver superior bass and clear vocals every time.

 
Auto Optimization
With its unique and patented technology, AIUR can adjust the configuration by detecting its surroundings and provides you with the optimized sound quality all the time.

 
Patented Decoding Algorithm
And if that wasn’t enough, we added our proprietary sound decoding algorithm, coupled with the latest CSR core and Bluetooth 4.2 electronics – along with APT-X professional audio decoding technology to guard against lossless transmission, plus the latest Digital Signal Processing (DSP) for enhanced amplification.

 
Ring off & Hang up
Not only for music, AIUR can also allow you to answer the phone calls once you connect it to the cell phone by Bluetooth.

 
LED Light Indicator
Using twinkle frequency and light interaction technology, the color changing LED provides clear visual feedback to instantly confirm each function as it’s selected.

 
Sync in Pair
What’s more, if you are looking for the ultimate surround sound 3D Hi-Fi theatre experience, simply perform a simple gesture to pair another AIUR and enjoy the true stereo sound.

 
12 Hour Working Time
AIUR can work for 12 hours with one full charge. AIUR is designed to automatically turn off when there's no streaming music coming in, saving power for when it’s needed.

 
3 Options of Stand Choice
We have designed 3 different stands, electroplating stand, spider stand, and a hanging strip, allows you to put AIUR wherever you like.

 
Premium Home Theater
Wireless connected with your Smart TV, AIUR turns your home into a premium home theater, taking control freely with gesture motivation. The unique design brings you a delight to the eyes when enjoying immersive Sound effects.

quality, but what about the quality of the actual audio recording?<br/><br/>In May 2017, we were hanging out with our audiophile friends and talking about the shortages of features in existing microphones but the high quality of speakers, video, and cameras. It led us to question why people don’t place the importance of video recording and audio recording on the same level. That was the moment the Thronmax story started.<br/><br/>Our ambition led us to create the best design by carefully crafting all the details, and our vision led us to innovate unique features such noise reduction Vertigain® Technology.<br/><br/>We were determined to use only the best real materials, such as die-cast aluminum on the body, a metal shaft inside the microphone, and metal for all moving parts, to achieve the most durable product.    And most importantly, our friendship helped maintain the core of MDrill development and gave spirit to all stages of the project.</p><p><a href=""https://enventyspartners.com/work/case-studies?ref=MDrillOneIGG"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.makeagif.com/media/3-12-2018/IYP_6k.gif"" src=""""/></a></p><div style=""font-size:11px;""><a href=""producthype.co/?ref=MDrillOneIGG"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.makeagif.com/media/3-12-2018/Mk2yxD.gif"" src=""""/></a></div><div style=""font-size:11px;""> </div><div style=""font-size:11px;"">

This technology increases recording quality and clarity by up to 10% compared to other mics.Nature of AcousticsIn reality, there are some properties of acoustics that affect the acoustic space. These properties can either improve the quality of the sound or interfere with the sound. One of these properties, reflection is defines as the change in direction of a wave when it hits an object. Many acoustic engineers took advantage from this. Reflection theory can be used to enhance the acoustics in an enclosure for better performance.Typical Microphone GrilleWhile collecting the sound in the acoustic space, the typical mesh structure of the current microphone grilles scatters the sound waves inside the microphone which interferes with the performance of the condensers.VERTIGAIN® Design GrilleIn Vertigain® design grille, the sound waves reaches the 3 condensers without being scattered by any grille mesh (commonly found in many regular microphones) and are collected in a more homogenious pattern,  thus resulting in higher performance compared to the other digital microphones. Sound waves are regulated through specially designed VERTIGAIN® grille.Switch to the noise reduction mode to ensure a ‘no distractions’ recording, which means you won’t have to worry about your MDrill One picking up background or ambient noise, even if it occurs while you’re speaking. Choose between five options of how MDrill One will pick up sound without buying five different mics. Recording modes include cardioid, stereo, bidirectional, omnidirectional and noise reduction.Experience absolutely no lag time between when you talk into the MDrill One mic and when it records sound. That means you’ll hear yourself in real time, every timeYour preferred recording settings will save within the MDrill One mic. That means you don’t have to worry about re-setting up each time MDrill One is turned off or unplugged Mount your MDrill One with different universal accessories including a pop filter or mic extension.MDrill One comes compatible with microphone stands having  5/8”-27 threaded screw.3/8” Female To 5/8"" Male Threaded Screw Adapter can be used for easily switching the mounting type.Power up and connect the MDrill One to most computers directly through a USB Type C cable connection. USB-C connection is lightning fast, so you don’t have to worry about a wait time.USB Type C, which is just starting to show up in consumer devices, has some cool new features that you won’t find in older USB connectors.It’s small. The new port is half the width and one-third the height of a standard USB connector.It’s reversible. Unlike older USB cable, it doesn’t matter which side is up with a Type C plug; you can insert it either way.It’s fast. Type C ports can transfer data using the zippy speeds of the latest version of the USB protocol — up to 10 gigabits per second.It’s flexible. Via adapters, users will be able to connect older devices to Type C ports.  The MDrill One is perfect for...  Both MDrill One and MDrill Zero are compatible with the software below. and more...  Love the MDrill One but need something smaller and more refined?The MDrill Zero offers the same professional-grade recording as the MDrill One but with two recording modes: cardioid and omnidirectional.The MDrill Zero is also incredibly compact, coming in a little over half the size of the MDrill One. Think of the MDrill Zero as your new favorite travel companion, without having to compromise quality. People today spend thousands of dollars on the best speakers with perfect sound quality, but what about the quality of the actual audio recording?In May 2017, we were hanging out with our audiophile friends and talking about the shortages of features in existing microphones but the high quality of speakers, video, and cameras. It led us to question why people don’t place the importance of video recording and audio recording on the same level. That was the moment the Thronmax story started.Our ambition led us to create the best design by carefully crafting all the details, and our vision led us to innovate unique features such noise reduction Vertigain® Technology.We were determined to use only the best real materials, such as die-cast aluminum on the body, a metal shaft inside the microphone, and metal for all moving parts, to achieve the most durable product.    And most importantly, our friendship helped maintain the core of MDrill development and gave spirit to all stages of the project. 
We can’t thank you enough for checking out our project and helping us make the MDrill One a reality.We know not everyone will be able to support us with a pledge, so even if you can’t give a dollar or purchase the MDrill One, if you’re a supporter of MDrill One or Thronmax, you can help us spread the word on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Instagram and anywhere else you can think of!   1.

<div>You are probably wondering what's under the hood. We don't mind sharing. </div>
<div>
<p><b>Upgraded Power</b></p>
<p>DACport HD takes 5V from USB and filters the living daylights out of it, to make sure all noise is kept out of your audio. Internally, in addition to multiple filter stages, DACport HD has five power supplies, creating six different voltages to power its high-end digital and analog circuitry.</p>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><p><b>Upgraded Amp</b></p>
<p>During the very successful <b>HiFi-Skyn</b> effort, we developed Amp Extreme, a <span style=""background-color: initial;"">headphone amplifier circuit that delivers high power and ultra low distortion, making any headphones sing loud and clear. DACport HD has Amp Extreme built in. </span></p></span></div>
<div><b>Upgraded DAC</b></div>
<div>DACport HD also shares the DAC chip with HiFi-Skyn. The DAC chip used here is the brand new AK4490 from AKM. CEntrance is an official 3-rd party development lab for AKM, so we have access to the best parts and we know how to use them. Analog interfacing is still largely a black art, but we've perfected it over the last 15 years.</div>
<div><b>Upgraded USB</b></div>
<div>The asynchronous USB interface is handled by the brand new XMOS U8 chip. CEntrance is also a 3-rd development house for XMOS. we help XMOS build their parts into other companies' products and this gives us unprecedented level of support.</div>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434087343/kc8rak7xh5fclr1arj8x.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>

<span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;"">Which headphones should I use?</span><br/>
</div>
<p>We get that question a lot. You are in luck. You can use pretty much any high-end headphones. Because DACport HD has a powerful amp, it will match up not just with the ultra-sensitive IEMs, but also with the high-end models from AKG, Audeze, Beyerdynamic, Fostex, HiFi-Man, Mr. Speakers, Sennheiser, and many others. Very few DAC/Amps can boast this kind of performance, but DACport HD can! All of these famous models are supported:</p>

It's gotten smaller! Now just the size of a lighter!
It's gotten smarter! Now with full 384kHz high-definition audio!
It's gotten cheaper! Now, the famed CEntrance quality is truly affordable!


Introducing DACport HD
DACport HD plugs into your laptop and dramatically improves the sound quality of the connected headphones. The real strength of DACport HD is the ability to handle pretty much any headphones, from large over-the-head cans to sensitive IEMs. All that with pitch-black noise floor, unmeasurable jitter and lowest distortion!






Features at a glance:



Audiophile-grade D/A converter plays HD music with bit-perfect accuracy.

Headphone amp designed for listening without fatigue, offers clarity, soundstage and detail.

Plug 'n play operation with Mac laptops, bundled ASIO driver for Windows.

No power adapter, no battery to charge—DACport HD uses USB power and works anywhere you take your laptop.

DACport HD's 1.8"" (3.5mm) headphone jack drives the most advanced headphones on the market.




Overall, the product shape resembles a lighter. You hold it in one hand and where your thumb usually goes to strike the lighter, that's where the volume control is on DACport HD. It's a very innovative, ergonomic design.

Under the hood
You are probably wondering what's under the hood. We don't mind sharing. 

Upgraded Power
DACport HD takes 5V from USB and filters the living daylights out of it, to make sure all noise is kept out of your audio. Internally, in addition to multiple filter stages, DACport HD has five power supplies, creating six different voltages to power its high-end digital and analog circuitry.

Upgraded Amp
During the very successful HiFi-Skyn effort, we developed Amp Extreme, a headphone amplifier circuit that delivers high power and ultra low distortion, making any headphones sing loud and clear. DACport HD has Amp Extreme built in. 
Upgraded DAC
DACport HD also shares the DAC chip with HiFi-Skyn. The DAC chip used here is the brand new AK4490 from AKM. CEntrance is an official 3-rd party development lab for AKM, so we have access to the best parts and we know how to use them. Analog interfacing is still largely a black art, but we've perfected it over the last 15 years.
Upgraded USB
The asynchronous USB interface is handled by the brand new XMOS U8 chip. CEntrance is also a 3-rd development house for XMOS. we help XMOS build their parts into other companies' products and this gives us unprecedented level of support.


Which headphones should I use?

We get that question a lot. You are in luck. You can use pretty much any high-end headphones. Because DACport HD has a powerful amp, it will match up not just with the ultra-sensitive IEMs, but also with the high-end models from AKG, Audeze, Beyerdynamic, Fostex, HiFi-Man, Mr. Speakers, Sennheiser, and many others. Very few DAC/Amps can boast this kind of performance, but DACport HD can! All of these famous models are supported:





What We Need & What You Get
Our previous campaign, HiFi-Skyn is going to manufacturing next week. There we raised over $140K with the help of crowd funding and are very grateful to all who contributed both money and ideas. The resulting product is top-notch and we are very proud of our efforts.
Help us make DACport HD a success. We have shown working demos at THE Show in Newport and got great feedback from users and press. Now we need to get it to production, which requires tooling. Help us get there and get a great deal in return!
This campaign will have some very attractive, but short-term perks. Hurry to grab the best deal and you will be happy with your new DACport HD!
From all of us at CEntrance, thank you!",16.0,0,"7 Campaigns

Basswall is a high power, high quality sound system built to be invisible to the casual. The 'stealth ninja' of bluetooth speakers easily connects to any bluetooth enabled device, and doesn’t require the download of special applications. Loud enough to simulate a full studio sound system, without the bulk of many speakers. Enjoy Basswall as a speaker AND as your favorite work of art.You choose the music. You choose the artwork. It’s that simple.    DETAIL VIEW OF BASSWALL AS SEEN ON“I can’t believe that from that little thing, the sound comes the way it does, it’s crazy!It just sounds like it’s loads of speakers around...and it isn’t!”Basswall was brought to a local Irish Bar in Antibes and Cannes France to get feedback of the product. Genuine unsuspecting people react to seeing Basswall for the first time!Inside Basswall is a large cavity with special sound damping material that reduces the speed of sound. This tricks the bass frequencies into thinking the cavity is much larger than it actually is. We then add a finely tuned bass port to exponentially increase the effect. In simple terms, Basswall produces “big” sound, from a “small” speaker source.Then, All frequencies above 1000 HZ are fired upwards from four speakers on top of the Basswall, hitting the ceiling and back wall to spread in a 180 degree outwards. Again, in simple terms, It's the same principle as putting your phone in a glass to amplify the sound, but as walls are flat, no unwanted secondary reverberation occurs. The resulting effect is truly magical.

Not only does it play music in high-fidelity, but it’s a powerful handheld flashlight and a mobile charging power bank for your favorite devices. With its waterproof, shockproof, and dustproof construction, Solarbox Lumine is ready to handle the bumps and bruises of your adventures.With Bluetooth and dual inputs, connect to your devices however you choose while hearing your music like never before. Solarbox Lumine is the ultimate travel companion, and once you experience it, you’ll wonder how you traveled without it for so long.The Lumine is the perfect device when going off the grid into the wilderness. Never let a dead battery slow you down again! Simply place the Lumine in direct sunlight, and the internal battery will charge safely and automatically.Using the power of the sun, you can not only charge up the Lumine but any other devices you have, using the built-in power bank. Who likes waiting? When you're always on the move, you shouldn't need to wait to charge up. The Lumine features fast power conversion. In as little as ten minutes of direct sunlight, you can enjoy 30 minutes of audio playback.This is all possible thanks to the efficient and advanced power converter built-in. Keep the good times rolling and never experience a silent moment with Lumine. Where other portable speakers fall short, the Lumine lasts longer with a stunning 20+ hours of playback time. With a large-capacity battery that regulates power efficiently, you can keep the music going, and your devices powered up well throughout the night.The best part is that when the sun is out, the Lumine is continuously charging all while still playing music. With the Lumine, worrying about a dead battery is never an issue.
 You should never run out of battery when out in the wild. The large-capacity 5,000 mAh battery can keep the music going for hours and charge up your devices multiple times over.If you’re out of the sunlight or at home, use the USB charging capability of the Lumine to keep the device charged for when you need it most.Forget about lugging along extra flashlights and lanterns that will slow you down. With the Lumine, you can save precious weight and space during backpacking trips into the wild.The LED light is capable of getting extremely bright and will help shine the way wherever you go.Different situations call for different types of lights. Rather than carrying four different flashlights and lanterns, the Lumine's four lighting modes are perfect for a variety of conditions.Use the low lighting mode to see in the tent at night, high power for viewing further into the darkness, and SOS when in an emergency situation.You shouldn’t let a little rain ruin your parade, and the Lumine won’t let it. The robust construction and design of the Lumine is ready for a splash in the lake, the pool, or wherever your next adventure takes you.The IPX7 rating isn't given to just any device, and we're proud of the quality of the construction we've achieved. Take the Lumine for a swim and keep the music playing.On any adventure, you can expect to experience some bumpy roads. Don't let the windy, rough trails keep you from enjoying your music! The Lumine features a robust construction complete with a rubberized case with impact-absorbing silica gel to protect the inner components.So be as gentle or as rough as you want with the Lumine; it can take it. Whether you're on the beach or out tearing up some sand dunes, dirt in your speaker should be the last of your worries. The Lumine is built to let the sound out and keep the elements out. Keep the tunes going wherever you are with the peace of mind knowing your speaker is 100% protected.

You should demand more from your portable speaker. The Lumine is robust enough to handle your toughest adventures with revolutionary features, but sound quality is still a priority. The Lumine's speakers pump out sound at a superior quality with a distortion level of less than 0.1%.Wherever you are, demand more from your sound and enjoy home theater quality sound in a robust and compact package. Who says portable speakers need to be tinny and quiet? Thanks to 2*10w speaker drivers, the Lumine is capable of delivering music loud enough to get the party bumping.At a max volume of 110dB, you’ll be able to let the entire forest hear you and might even shake some trees!
 The Lumine isn't just a bass machine – it also has audiophile-level audio quality that you can take anywhere. We took our time in designing the audio circuit of the Lumine to ensure it offers a balanced spectrum of sound.So, along with booming bass, you can experience perfectly balanced mids, along with crisp highs that are anything but tinny. 


 With the advanced Bluetooth 4.2 chip built into Lumine, stream high-quality audio from your Bluetooth enabled device. The Lumine features an extended range, meaning you can still play audio near or far.Let your music follow you wherever you go through wireless Bluetooth streaming! 
 Sometimes Bluetooth isn't available. That shouldn't be a reason for the music to stop! With the built-in auxiliary input, simply plug in any music device, and you're ready to rock!This also means that you’ll have the highest audio quality available pumping through the Lumine’s 2 * 10w speakers!What if you don’t want to bring your audio device along for the trip? The Lumine offers even more convenience with a built-in TF card port! Simply load up your favorite music onto the card ahead of time and load it into the Lumine.The Lumine will automatically playback the files on the card in hi-fidelity. Leave your devices at home for an unplugged trip while keeping your music with you at all times!

Use the Lumine at home or on the go as your new favorite speakerphone. Let your friends hear you loud and clear through hi-fi audio.Keep your hands free and keep the conversation going wherever you are!When traversing trails or even just carrying your beach chairs to the water, you need your hands free.

Having only ourselves to deal with, enables us to be agile with a very fast turnaround.  WE MAKE QUALITY AFFORDABLEWhen you buy Apple, you’re indirectly paying for the million-dollar advertisements you see in the news and on TV. You're paying for their brick and mortar stores in prominent locations around the world.With us, we don’t have all of these miscellaneous expenses. We’re using Indiegogo to kick-start our journey and connect directly with the consumer. When you buy from us, you’re only paying for the outstanding tech we produce and we think that the savings should be passed on to you.TUNINGWe pay expert attention to tuning. Each earbud is carefully tuned to provide a full frequency HiFi performance.  THE ART OF EARBUDS DESIGNWe designed the shape of the Dutchbudz for a best secure fit with minimal listening fatigue when worn for longer periods.Every backer will also receive comfort accessories for unique ear shapes and sizes, additional rubber eartips to make the experience more comfortable.  WHERE WILL THE FUNDING GO?
We have an existing factory so we don’t need to pay out huge partner costs
Research & development for future products (we will reward loyal backers with significant discounts)
Marketing investment to build the brand
 RISKS & CHALLENGESWe are a collaborative team with a proven track record of product development, manufacturing and distribution.We are a first-party brand, meaning we design and make the buds we sell. Owning our own factory means we are agile with a very fast turnaround. This reduces the level of risk since we only have ourselves to deal with! Dutchbudz are ready to go, they are not a prototype. Our product housing for the Dutchbudz is an existing product shell already in mass production. With positive feedback on the fit, comfort and style, we have taken our earbuds to a new level packed with state of the art technology.",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The <strong>Sodapop</strong> speaker has been designed to solve the main problem for small portable loudspeakers: They struggle to reproduce low frequency bass, resulting in a somewhat feeble sound. </p>
<p>The Sodapop invention solves this problem by connecting the speaker to its own carrying case or any other suitable plastic bottle. This offers a compact portable wireless speaker that provide you with louder music, twice as much bass and an overall superior sound.</p>

<p>Using the Sodapop speaker is a fun, low-cost experience with a significant wow-factor, all the while creating a new use for the drinking bottle, extending its life cycle and adding value to the empty container.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Sodapop speaker forms a natural link between people and popular music. In a fun and social setting, when friends are hanging out and playing music, the Sodapop speaker and a soda bottle can be the center of attention. The speaker creates an exciting, new functional value for the bottle, and the users will be able to compare and evaluate different bottle designs, sizes and materials.</p>

<p><i>So there you have it, real bass requires real space.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>By utilizing the characteristics of the bottle material and the air inside the bottle, the Sodapop speaker can increase the sound volume in the bass range by as much as 10dB. </p>
<p>To the human ear a 10dB increase will sound approximately twice as loud, so in other words the Sodapop speaker can generate twice as much bass, just by connecting an ordinary soda bottle. The effect is striking once the bottle is attached.</p>

<p><strong>Øyvind Warp</strong>, Co-founder of Sodapop, and head of Product Development, has significant knowledge and experience with speakers and tech-business in general from over 20 years working with electronics. He is also a passionate part-time designer and has done the artwork on this campaign including videos and animations.</p>
<p>Priding himself on being very hands-on, Øyvind spends a lot of time in Norway and China ensuring that the Sodapop is developed using the very latest technology, whilst making no compromises on quality. Øyvind's passion for tech was the very motivation to start up the company – and he was the one bringing the Sodapop from idea to reality by making the first prototypes in the back office of his electronics store. Øyvind has great passion for music, his music taste was a bit stuck in electronica in his early years, but luckily his taste for music has expanded to almost every genre you can imagine.</p>
<p><strong>Øystein Lien</strong>, Co-founder of Sodapop, is educated in marketing from the Norwegian Business School (BI), has a long experience in customer relations and service and has worked for more that 15 years in the payment industry.</p>
<p>Together with Nicolai, Øystein will take care of Sales and Distributions of the Sodapop. And together with Øyvind he is bringing his marketing skills to the test. Øystein has a passion for football and he is often referred to as ""Factastein"" as he has knowledge of things nobody else has the brainpower to remember. His taste in music spans from 70´s Bowie and 90´s grimey hip-hop in Wu-Tang Clan, to the 00´s Norwegian golden age of electronica and rock music personified in Queens of the Stoneage, Foo Fighters and The White Stripes.</p>
<p><strong>Ole Nicolai Olsen</strong>, Co-founder of Sodapop, is educated within maritime disciplines from Southampton University, has worked within the shipping business for the last 18 years. Nicolai is head of the company board and our financial guru. Together with Øystein he is also in charge of Sales and Distributions of the Sodapop speaker. Nicolai has a big heart, and he is a funny guy to hang out with, but he can also be very focused and disciplined, and that’s a good thing when he uses that to keep the project on the right tracks. Nicolai also plays the guitar, used to be in a band, and is a huge Pixies fan.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Alexander Trones</strong>, Acoustician, is educated from The Norwegian School of Science and Technology and have worked as a sound consultant on the Sodapop project. We knew it would work, Tom explained to us why it did. Tom also has a great passion for guitars and he used to have long hair to go with it, today he has cut his hair but still loves his guitars, so much he is even building his own on his free time. It looks like his music taste all spans around bands that frequently uses the guitar in their songs. We like that about Tom, he´s got passion!</p>
<p>We are all audiophiles here. Every member of our team participates in different ways in the product development process, from the conception of the idea to fulfillment. We develop the kind of product we would love to have ourselves. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>As a start-up, we are fully aware of the risks we are facing and have taken pro-active steps to manage and reduce them. Having identified our own strengths and weaknesses, we have teamed up with best-in-class partners wherever we can, in order to have access to appropriate expertise wherever we need it.</p>
<p>We have identified the below as our main risk factors, and taken the following steps to eliminate and reduce risk where we can:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Production</strong></p>
<p>The main concept of our speaker is to deliver superior quality at an unbeatable price. We have chosen to outsource production to a Chinese factory with a long and strong track record of delivering speakers to European markets. The factory was chosen after careful vetting, and we are confident we have made the right selection. Our research revealed that this factory has delivered with error margins down as low as 0,3% (i.e. 3 of 1,000 speakers returned after sales due to errors (this is very good in electronics, where retailers usually accept up to 2%). </p>
<p>We intend to keep personnel regularly at the factory once production is up and running to monitor the process and ensure our quality requirements are strictly followed. Sodapop intends to start of production in small batches to ensure we are able to monitor and adjust the production to any unforeseen issues. </p>
<p>For larger quantities, we run typical supply chain risk. We've done mass production before and we have existing relationship with the manufacturer, who has years of experience with large volumes and has well established connections with subcontractors for the parts needed in this product. Our factory partner can deliver well in excess of 4 million speakers per year and hence factory capacity is unlikely to become an issue in the near future.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Concept quality</strong></p>
<p>In order to ensure maximum sound performance, we partnered with an experienced acoustician and an industrial design studio to optimize the design and structure of the speaker. Throughout the process, we have tested the prototypes in a professional sound studio. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Financing </strong></p>
<p>Revolving credit facility for orders up to 10,000 units is already in place. If the product proves to be a big success the credit facility would have to be re-negotiated, but we believe the credit facility we already have negotiated, should be sufficient to handle the demand. The company also has the option of having orders shipped by air freight, reducing the time the drawn credit is used and hence can increase the rotation of the credit to handle an increased number of orders.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Logistics </strong></p>
<p>To ensure that the distribution of our speakers will go as smoothly as possible, we have outsourced the logistics to a professional third-party service provider.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Sales</strong> </p>
<p>This is an ongoing process which will be intensified once the first production batch has arrived. We have tested our speaker with a couple of electronics retailers and received very positive feedback, but most retailers are reluctant to make orders based on prototypes. Still, we have already secured the commitment of one of the leading electronics retailers in Scandinavia, and we believe we have already validated the commercial potential for the product.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Marketing </strong></p>
<p>This is also an ongoing process, where we will make use of the different resources available to us at every step of way. We are committed to renewing ourselves constantly, staying updated on the latest tools and trends, to get this speaker on top of every potential portable speaker customer’s mind. We also have the advantage of having an in-house team of great creative artists that can produce and deliver any marketing material needed, from in-store graphics, packaging and sales material to commercial videos, webpages, banners and posts for social media marketing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Patent rights </strong></p>
<p>The company has already secured international patent rights for our speaker under The Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) network which consists of 152 countries and states. We are in the process of securing our patent in most of this network with the help of the biggest intellectual property law firm in Norway, also listed as top tier in the world regarding trademark, copyright and patent law.</p>

GO TO WWW.SODAPOP-AUDIO.COM ""Could the Sodapop potentially work as promised? Of course it can...using this clever trick, the Sodapop should sound a lot better than most other portable speakers its size.""Andrew Liszewski, editor, GIZMODO""Sodapop delivers a low-cost and fun experience that is rich in bass thanks to itstruly unique design..... allows it to push 10dB louder sound… to you and me that’sapproximately twice as loud.......is this the perfect compact speaker?!""James Hoare, editor , YANKODESIGN    

 
The Sodapop speaker has been designed to solve the main problem for small portable loudspeakers: They struggle to reproduce low frequency bass, resulting in a somewhat feeble sound. 
The Sodapop invention solves this problem by connecting the speaker to its own carrying case or any other suitable plastic bottle. This offers a compact portable wireless speaker that provide you with louder music, twice as much bass and an overall superior sound.
 
Successfully funded on Kickstarter.com

The Sodapop is designed and developed in Oslo, Norway by a team consisting of award-winning industrial designers, acousticians, tech enthusiasts, speaker nerds and music loving entrepreneurs.

 
Sodapop combines Scandinavian design, quality and innovation to form a new type of compact portable speakers that looks great and sounds amazing. 
 



 
Scandinavian design - characterized by functionality, quality, simplicity and clean lines - ensures that playing music from your mobile devices is intuitive, easy and fun.
 


 
The custom made bass bottle doubles as a protective carrying case for the speaker unit. Even so, the threaded interface that fastens the bottle is compatible with most regular plastic beverage bottles just about anywhere in the world. This makes the Sodapop speaker the perfect travelling companion: You can find a suitable bottle everywhere; in your hotel room, the local store, at the beach etc. 
 

 
Using the Sodapop speaker is a fun, low-cost experience with a significant wow-factor, all the while creating a new use for the drinking bottle, extending its life cycle and adding value to the empty container.
 
The Sodapop speaker forms a natural link between people and popular music. In a fun and social setting, when friends are hanging out and playing music, the Sodapop speaker and a soda bottle can be the center of attention. The speaker creates an exciting, new functional value for the bottle, and the users will be able to compare and evaluate different bottle designs, sizes and materials.

 

 

So there you have it, real bass requires real space.
 
By utilizing the characteristics of the bottle material and the air inside the bottle, the Sodapop speaker can increase the sound volume in the bass range by as much as 10dB. 
To the human ear a 10dB increase will sound approximately twice as loud, so in other words the Sodapop speaker can generate twice as much bass, just by connecting an ordinary soda bottle. The effect is striking once the bottle is attached.
 

 

 
We have tested the Sodapop in a professional sound lab and the results are exactly what we were aiming for. As the frequency response graphs shows, the Sodapop speaker delivers unmatched power throughout the whole audio spectrum.
Our goal is to achieve the best sound quality in a portable wireless speaker, with as much bass as possible without loss of definition, and at a very consumer-friendly price. 
The Sodapop team has been working with professionals in the music and product development industry. They have provided us with regular feedback on prototypes and helped us to get closer and closer to the ultimate sound experience. 
 

 






Hundreds of sketches and prototypes have been 3D-printed to find the optimal combination of sound, functionality and design.
 

 
We have teamed up with Permafrost, a Norwegian design studio based in Oslo consisting of five industrial designers. Their design philosophy is all about creating consumer products that are user friendly, simple and safe, with just enough personality to make them stand out. 
At Permafrost they are particularly fond of projects that bridge the gap between technology and art, and believe designers have an obligation to turn all the world’s technological achievements into meaningful innovations for people.
 

 

 
We have spent a lot of time finding the right manufacturer for the Sodapop speaker. After several trips to China we finally found the perfect manufacturer in Shenzhen. Having developed and produced speakers since 1999, they have tons of experience and a great track record. Currently, our manufacturer produces 4 million units pr. year. We are very confident that they are up for the task and ready to deliver the high-quality product that meets our Scandinavian expectations and demands.
 

 

 


 

 

It’s difficult to present sound in a video! Make sure you connect some good headphones, so you can get an impression of how the Sodapop sounds like. But still the reproduction of the sound will not be as good as live listening.

 

 

 
The founders who came up with the Sodapop idea all share a passion for music and technology, and they have a lot of experience in electronics and consumer products. 
The founders gathered experts in multiple domains such as audio design, Industrial design, music-, speaker- and tech industries. Between them, the team members have over 20 years of experience in audio, technology, product design and manufacturing. 
Getting Sodapop from idea to reality has been a tremendous team effort. We’ve worked on it full time since 2016. Our Sodapop portable speakers are now ready for production, and we’re so excited to share what we’ve built with the Kickstarter community.
Early after the birth of the idea of Sodapop, the original founders of the Sodapop concept initialized a cooperation with Permafrost design studio. 
 

 
Permafrost is a groundbreaking Norwegian design studio with multiple Red-Dot award including best of the best awards. Permafrost was established in 2000, founded by 4 industrial designers all educated from the Oslo School of Architecture. Today Permafrost consist of 5 brilliant industrial designers and is leading and carrying out the design process for the Sodapop speaker.
 

 
Øyvind Warp, Co-founder of Sodapop, and head of Product Development, has significant knowledge and experience with speakers and tech-business in general from over 20 years working with electronics. He is also a passionate part-time designer and has done the artwork on this campaign including videos and animations.
Priding himself on being very hands-on, Øyvind spends a lot of time in Norway and China ensuring that the Sodapop is developed using the very latest technology, whilst making no compromises on quality. Øyvind's passion for tech was the very motivation to start up the company – and he was the one bringing the Sodapop from idea to reality by making the first prototypes in the back office of his electronics store. Øyvind has great passion for music, his music taste was a bit stuck in electronica in his early years, but luckily his taste for music has expanded to almost every genre you can imagine.
Øystein Lien, Co-founder of Sodapop, is educated in marketing from the Norwegian Business School (BI), has a long experience in customer relations and service and has worked for more that 15 years in the payment industry.
Together with Nicolai, Øystein will take care of Sales and Distributions of the Sodapop. And together with Øyvind he is bringing his marketing skills to the test. Øystein has a passion for football and he is often referred to as ""Factastein"" as he has knowledge of things nobody else has the brainpower to remember. His taste in music spans from 70´s Bowie and 90´s grimey hip-hop in Wu-Tang Clan, to the 00´s Norwegian golden age of electronica and rock music personified in Queens of the Stoneage, Foo Fighters and The White Stripes.
Ole Nicolai Olsen, Co-founder of Sodapop, is educated within maritime disciplines from Southampton University, has worked within the shipping business for the last 18 years. Nicolai is head of the company board and our financial guru. Together with Øystein he is also in charge of Sales and Distributions of the Sodapop speaker. Nicolai has a big heart, and he is a funny guy to hang out with, but he can also be very focused and disciplined, and that’s a good thing when he uses that to keep the project on the right tracks. Nicolai also plays the guitar, used to be in a band, and is a huge Pixies fan.
Tom Alexander Trones, Acoustician, is educated from The Norwegian School of Science and Technology and have worked as a sound consultant on the Sodapop project. We knew it would work, Tom explained to us why it did. Tom also has a great passion for guitars and he used to have long hair to go with it, today he has cut his hair but still loves his guitars, so much he is even building his own on his free time. It looks like his music taste all spans around bands that frequently uses the guitar in their songs. We like that about Tom, he´s got passion!
We are all audiophiles here. Every member of our team participates in different ways in the product development process, from the conception of the idea to fulfillment. We develop the kind of product we would love to have ourselves. 
 

 

 

 
We have already spend a lot of our own money on the development of this speaker, now we need your help to make this project come to life.
We love cakes! Let us visualize the spending for you.
The production and development of the moulds + the speakers itself carries the largest cost, after that comes marketing costs of this campaign, because we need to boost our campaign-related posts on Facebook and Instagram in order to stand out from the crowd.

 

 
As a start-up, we are fully aware of the risks we are facing and have taken pro-active steps to manage and reduce them. Having identified our own strengths and weaknesses, we have teamed up with best-in-class partners wherever we can, in order to have access to appropriate expertise wherever we need it.
We have identified the below as our main risk factors, and taken the following steps to eliminate and reduce risk where we can:
 
Production
The main concept of our speaker is to deliver superior quality at an unbeatable price. We have chosen to outsource production to a Chinese factory with a long and strong track record of delivering speakers to European markets. The factory was chosen after careful vetting, and we are confident we have made the right selection. Our research revealed that this factory has delivered with error margins down as low as 0,3% (i.e. 3 of 1,000 speakers returned after sales due to errors (this is very good in electronics, where retailers usually accept up to 2%). 
We intend to keep personnel regularly at the factory once production is up and running to monitor the process and ensure our quality requirements are strictly followed. Sodapop intends to start of production in small batches to ensure we are able to monitor and adjust the production to any unforeseen issues. 
For larger quantities, we run typical supply chain risk. We've done mass production before and we have existing relationship with the manufacturer, who has years of experience with large volumes and has well established connections with subcontractors for the parts needed in this product. Our factory partner can deliver well in excess of 4 million speakers per year and hence factory capacity is unlikely to become an issue in the near future.
 
Concept quality
In order to ensure maximum sound performance, we partnered with an experienced acoustician and an industrial design studio to optimize the design and structure of the speaker. Throughout the process, we have tested the prototypes in a professional sound studio. 
 
Financing 
Revolving credit facility for orders up to 10,000 units is already in place. If the product proves to be a big success the credit facility would have to be re-negotiated, but we believe the credit facility we already have negotiated, should be sufficient to handle the demand. The company also has the option of having orders shipped by air freight, reducing the time the drawn credit is used and hence can increase the rotation of the credit to handle an increased number of orders.
 
Logistics 
To ensure that the distribution of our speakers will go as smoothly as possible, we have outsourced the logistics to a professional third-party service provider.
 
Sales 
This is an ongoing process which will be intensified once the first production batch has arrived. We have tested our speaker with a couple of electronics retailers and received very positive feedback, but most retailers are reluctant to make orders based on prototypes. Still, we have already secured the commitment of one of the leading electronics retailers in Scandinavia, and we believe we have already validated the commercial potential for the product.
 
Marketing 
This is also an ongoing process, where we will make use of the different resources available to us at every step of way. We are committed to renewing ourselves constantly, staying updated on the latest tools and trends, to get this speaker on top of every potential portable speaker customer’s mind. We also have the advantage of having an in-house team of great creative artists that can produce and deliver any marketing material needed, from in-store graphics, packaging and sales material to commercial videos, webpages, banners and posts for social media marketing.
 
Patent rights 
The company has already secured international patent rights for our speaker under The Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) network which consists of 152 countries and states. We are in the process of securing our patent in most of this network with the help of the biggest intellectual property law firm in Norway, also listed as top tier in the world regarding trademark, copyright and patent law.
 
Local taxes 
Please note that whilst we endeavor to ensure that import taxes and duties are kept to a minimum for territories outside of our warehouse locations, local import taxes and duties may be required to be paid. Sodapop has no control over local customs offices and, as such, cannot be held responsible should you be charged import taxes and duties in addition to your purchase and shipping price. It is always best to check the position in your country beforehand.

<p>Truly Wireless Earphones (i.e Airpods, Earin) are extremely convenient gadgets. You can listen to your music on the go without struggling with tangled wires. Yet, TWS earphones come with their own set of problems:</p>
<p>1) Fall out of your ears easily as they do not fit all ear types. . </p>
<p>2) Suffer from a short battery life of roughly 3-4 hours. Their battery life cannot last a full day without being charged.</p>
<p>3) To make things worse, TWS earphones requires a charging case to charge. This means that the user have to wait for it to be charged before using it again. It can be frustrating especially when TWS earphones' battery life is so short.</p>

</h1><p>If you have ever owned a pair of earbuds, chances are, you've dealt with the frustration of having to replace them at least once. We recently had the opportunity to attend the largest consumer electronics show in Las Vegas, CES. There, we conducted several live polls and found that from thousands of participants, 100% of them had broken at least one pair of earbuds. While that might not be representative of the entire earbud-owning
population, the fact remains: earbuds break all the time.</p><p>After producing several models of earphones and doing extensive analysis, we have noticed that there is something missing from the current market: affordable, super-durable earbuds with a lifetime warranty. We decided to create something new. Something stronger... Something reinforced. Thus, the AudiOHM RNFs were born.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1215332/files/20150211160148-GGAORNF100RSEW_LS_LRG.jpg?1423699308"" src="""" style=""""/>Some
companies offer earbuds that come with a one year warranty. Maybe two years, if
you’re lucky. But what is the point of that warranty if you have to go through
the hassle of getting a replacement pair every month when they inevitably break?
With the AudiOHM RNFs, we aim to fix that problem once and for all. Not only are
we providing you with a LIFETIME of support, we have made these earbuds so
durable that you won’t have to use it!</p><p><strong></strong></p><h1>
<strong></strong><br/>
</h1><h1><strong>What Makes Them So Special?</strong></h1><p></p><p>Every aspect of our Patent Pending AudiOHM RNFs were specifically designed to target the
main areas of damage in ordinary earbuds.</p>
<ul>

<h1>How Do They Sound?</h1><p>When it comes to sound quality, we did not skimp on the
RNFs. We put just as much focus on sound quality as we did on durability. After

If you have ever owned a pair of earbuds, chances are, you've dealt with the frustration of having to replace them at least once. We recently had the opportunity to attend the largest consumer electronics show in Las Vegas, CES. There, we conducted several live polls and found that from thousands of participants, 100% of them had broken at least one pair of earbuds. While that might not be representative of the entire earbud-owning
population, the fact remains: earbuds break all the time.After producing several models of earphones and doing extensive analysis, we have noticed that there is something missing from the current market: affordable, super-durable earbuds with a lifetime warranty. We decided to create something new. Something stronger... Something reinforced. Thus, the AudiOHM RNFs were born.Some
companies offer earbuds that come with a one year warranty. Maybe two years, if
you’re lucky. But what is the point of that warranty if you have to go through
the hassle of getting a replacement pair every month when they inevitably break?
With the AudiOHM RNFs, we aim to fix that problem once and for all. Not only are
we providing you with a LIFETIME of support, we have made these earbuds so
durable that you won’t have to use it!

What Makes Them So Special?Every aspect of our Patent Pending AudiOHM RNFs were specifically designed to target the
main areas of damage in ordinary earbuds.

The Patent Pending driver housings are constructed from a tough
aluminum alloy
At 3mm, the Patent Pending cable is 3-5x thicker than average
earbuds


The Patent Pending Y connector and audio plug are filled with a super
dense solid injection molding and encased in a protective, flexible  silicone overlay
The Patent Pending inner cable is constructed with aramid fiber which is used in aerospace and military applications like body armor

How Do They Sound?When it comes to sound quality, we did not skimp on the
RNFs. We put just as much focus on sound quality as we did on durability. After
all, what’s the point of having a pair of earbuds for life if they don’t sound
great?
The three sizes of silicone ear gels provide a customized
fit for each individual user. The snug, secure fit provides a flush seal for your ears, enabling ambient noise isolation for uninterrupted audio in any situation. We used neodymium magnetic components for
high performance/cost ratio and product quality uniformity. Ultra responsive

<h3><b>Solution-The Beginning</b></h3>
<p>One evening while watching TV my wife picked up a magazine from beneath our TV and immediately I noticed an improvement in the sound quality and the voices were very clear. At that moment a SOLUTION to the Problem came to mind. Aka, the ""Light Bulb"" went on!</p>
<p> </p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/781/464/f6efac1e5daf25caed2d02ffa1df5167_original.JPG?v=1431480734&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=7e8aa06089dbe788d466be69d50cdd81"" src=""""/></figure><p> </p>
<p>Once we realized we could fix the problem many shapes and materials were tested. Every test resulted in improved TV sound quality and we knew we were on to something BIG!</p>
<p>After filing the Patents and Trademarks, we consulted with Audio Engineers. They helped with the design, materials selection and concluded that TV Sound ScoopZ are the affordable Solution for improving voice quality of factory TV speakers.</p>
<h3>Made in USA - 100% Recyclable Material</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>TV Sound ScoopZ are custom made in the USA using 100% recyclable materials and packaging. SoundScoopZ are each 10.25"" Long x 5.5"" High x 2"" Deep.</p>

Customer Satisfaction Rating: 99.6% Positive.  TVSoundScoopZ work as advertised! 
TVSoundScoopZ are Patented (U.S. Patent No. 9,583,092)TV Sound ScoopZ are in production and available for immediate delivery.  THE PROBLEM
TV manufacturers aim the speakers down rather than towards the viewer, creating the problem of muffled voices and missed conversations. These include the majors (Sony, Panasonic, Sharp, Vizio, Samsung, RCA, Toshiba, LG, JVC, Hitachi,  Emerson, Magnavox,  Sanyo, Westinghouse and more). 

This muffled voice problem has been well documented by CNET, PC World, Bloomberg, Forbes and other media sources. TVSoundScoopZ solves this audio problem, so you don't have to buy an expensive soundbar or speaker system, unless you choose to.
 

 
 
 
Solution-The Beginning
One evening while watching TV my wife picked up a magazine from beneath our TV and immediately I noticed an improvement in the sound quality and the voices were very clear. At that moment a SOLUTION to the Problem came to mind. Aka, the ""Light Bulb"" went on!
 
 
Once we realized we could fix the problem many shapes and materials were tested. Every test resulted in improved TV sound quality and we knew we were on to something BIG!
After filing the Patents and Trademarks, we consulted with Audio Engineers. They helped with the design, materials selection and concluded that TV Sound ScoopZ are the affordable Solution for improving voice quality of factory TV speakers.
Made in USA - 100% Recyclable Material
 
TV Sound ScoopZ are custom made in the USA using 100% recyclable materials and packaging. SoundScoopZ are each 10.25"" Long x 5.5"" High x 2"" Deep.
 
 
TV Sound ScoopZ easily attach to any wall mounted or pedestal TVs using the Velcro strips provided with each set. Velcro allows for easy adjustment and leveling.
 
 
 
 
Never miss conversation again while watching your favorite TV programs. Simply attach TV Sound ScoopZ and instantly enjoy improved TV voice quality and clarity.
Standard Independent Test Results = A+ rating
Independent test results show that the factory TV speaker's clarity is improved to an A+ (Excellent) with TVSoundScoopZ, compared to a B (Average) without the product attached. The Speech Transmission Index (STI) is the standard test that measures all Public Address Systems.

 
 
 

 
 
Assembly and Fulfillment
We have partnered with Opportunity Village (opportunityvillage.org) for our assembly and fulfillment. They are the largest non-profit, employer of people with handicaps and disabilities. They provide a variety of packaging, assembly and promotional services to most of the major hotel groups and hotel chains in Las Vegas and for-profit businesses throughout the US.

<h3>A Brief History of Enforcer</h3>
<p>The Jim Yoshii Pile-Up played their last show on Valentine's Day 2006 at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco. Soon after the group disbanded, I decided to continue making music on my own under the name Baby Panda. I worked on my solo debut for a little over a year,  getting help from my amazingly talented cousin Josiah Feinberg, virtuoso multi-instrumentalist and all-around-good-guy Will Wilcox, and production wizard Chad Imes, releasing it on July 17, 2007. The album, titled Enforcer, consisted of several songs that had been written for The Jim Yoshii Pile-Up's aborted fourth album, as well as many old songs from various periods of the previous ten years that I reworked. </p>
<p>I took the cover photograph at Bennington College in Vermont during a Jim Yoshii Pile-Up U.S. tour sometime between 2003 and 2005. Bennington College gave the band the entire alumni house to stay in overnight after the show, and it was a huge house, so each band member got his own room to sleep in. Needless to say, this is not what normally happens for bands of JYPU's stature. Most nights we would huddle on floors of friends' or well-wisher's houses or in hotel rooms meant for two people. I wanted to remember that night and Bennington College's generosity, so in the morning as I was leaving the room I had slept in the night before, I snapped a picture of my (rudely unmade) bed. Once I got the pictures developed (these were the days of film), I felt like the light in the photo was striking and that the photo was evocative of something more than just the good night's sleep I had gotten, so I decided to use the photo for the cover of my debut solo album, Enforcer.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Vinyl Pressing</h3>
<p>For the 10th anniversary pressing of Enforcer, I'll be going through Gotta Groove Records in Ohio, which comes highly recommended from a couple different sources. The pressing will be on random-colored vinyl with stamped labels and a full color jacket, under my own name rather than Baby Panda, as I've done with all my albums since Comfort. I've decided to keep the same photograph I originally used for the cover. The record will come with a lyrics zine that includes commentary on each track.</p>
<p>As a part of the 10th anniversary package, I'll be releasing ""Kevin Decline"" as a single with b-sides digitally and on a 7"" lathe cut. I will also be pressing an 8"" lathe cut with live in-studio versions of Enforcer songs. These lathe cuts will be limited to a numbered edition of 25 each. Additionally, there will be a special Enforcer t-shirt with an interpretation of the cover photo by artist Jonathan Bell Wolfe.</p>
<h3>Rewards</h3>
<ul>
<li>$6 mp3s of the album and ""Kevin Decline"" single</li>
<li>$15 mp3s of the album and single, and a 7"" lathe cut of the ""Kevin Decline"" single</li>

Paintings vary in size, but are small oil paintings by me on hand-built maple boxes that were overlaid with drawings of butterflies on the inside of the Picks Us Apart artwork. If you're interested in this package, email me, and I'll send you photos of the paintings. If you purchase, you'll have your choice of one of the five paintings, first come, first served.</li>

Most nights we would huddle on floors of friends' or well-wisher's houses or in hotel rooms meant for two people. I wanted to remember that night and Bennington College's generosity, so in the morning as I was leaving the room I had slept in the night before, I snapped a picture of my (rudely unmade) bed. Once I got the pictures developed (these were the days of film), I felt like the light in the photo was striking and that the photo was evocative of something more than just the good night's sleep I had gotten, so I decided to use the photo for the cover of my debut solo album, Enforcer.

Vinyl Pressing
For the 10th anniversary pressing of Enforcer, I'll be going through Gotta Groove Records in Ohio, which comes highly recommended from a couple different sources. The pressing will be on random-colored vinyl with stamped labels and a full color jacket, under my own name rather than Baby Panda, as I've done with all my albums since Comfort. I've decided to keep the same photograph I originally used for the cover. The record will come with a lyrics zine that includes commentary on each track.
As a part of the 10th anniversary package, I'll be releasing ""Kevin Decline"" as a single with b-sides digitally and on a 7"" lathe cut. I will also be pressing an 8"" lathe cut with live in-studio versions of Enforcer songs. These lathe cuts will be limited to a numbered edition of 25 each. Additionally, there will be a special Enforcer t-shirt with an interpretation of the cover photo by artist Jonathan Bell Wolfe.

DADS is a fan inspired audio/visual collaboration between Charles Caswell of the band Berried Alive, and Lucas Mann of the band Rings of Saturn. We decided to develop this collaboration because of an overwhelming flood of messages from fans telling us that we have very similar styles of music and need to collaborate with each other.
Charles Caswell is the guitarist, singer, songwriter, and producer of the band Berried Alive. Berried Alive is known for technical instrumentation, emotional lyrics, and chaotic, sometimes sadistic guitars, and is a pure expression of Charles's musical point of view.

Lucas Mann is the guitarist, keyboardist, programmer, producer, and founder of the band Rings of Saturn. Rings of Saturn's music features a highly technical style heavily influenced by themes of alien life and outer space. They have released four full-length albums, with their third, Lugal Ki En, released in 2014 and peaking at 126 on the American Billboard 200 chart, and their most recent album Ultu Ulla landing at 76 on the American Billboard 200 chart.

Goals

Record and release the craziest team shred collaboration album
Develop a funny and entertaining animation series based on two shredder dads. One being an Alien (Al), and the other is a Strawberry (Berry)

Meet Berry

Berry is a DAD from our developing universe. He loves guitar, beer, yard work, and magic tricks.
Meet Al

Al (short for Alien) is a DAD from our developing universe. He loves guitar, coffee, grilling food, and space exploration.
We have a list of some of your favorite musicians in mind to perform on our solo album, and we also plan on having some special guests make appearances as animated characters in our DADS cartoon series! This will truly be something unique to give to the metal community! 
We have an animation music video of our single, a guitar play through of us performing the song, and an official audio stream of the song for your listening pleasure. You can check all these out directly below!

Due to a detachable neck, Jammy easily fits into most of the backpacks and complies with the airlines carry-on regulations. 
Just take it out, lock two pieces together, and you’re ready to rock -- we call it lock’n’roll! 

Jammy will quench your thirst for rocking out in the places where even a ¾-sized guitar and a mini combo would be a total drawback -- on vacation, a business trip or in an office space.

 

 

 
Although Jammy can be plugged right into an amp and has a cool companion app, it can be played entirely on its own -- you only need a pair of earphones to rock Jammy Guitar!


Compact as it is, Jammy Guitar provides a sound range sufficient to play most of the rock songs.Due to a usual frets size, your fingers won’t feel any difference compared to a standard guitar. 
The fret bars with the unique precision sensors allow for realistic emulation of all the essential techniques like slides, bends, fingerpicking, and other stuff: 


 
Jammy can be used with different DAW's for creating on the go in both audio and MIDI modes: 


But our backers find their own uses for Jammy: 


 

 

Jammy Guitar generates sound directly on board, which allows avoiding any latency typical for digital guitars that send sound to mobile devices over Bluetooth.  With the ¼” and ⅛” standard jack audio outputs you don’t need any adapter -- plug your Jammy into an amp or just stick your earphones in, and you’re all good to rock!


Jammy Guitar’s real steel strings allow you adjusting the tension to get the exact feel you want


With Jammy, you can choose among three guitar types and a variety of onboard FX organized into presets realistically emulating the most iconic sounds in the history of guitar music. You can adjust each pedal separately and create your own custom FX presets


You can use Jammy Guitar as a MIDI controller with a digital audio workstation or an audio editor of your choice





Simply put, Jammy has the smallest latency and the broadest sound range, providing the best playability-to-portability ratio among digital guitars.¼” and ⅛” direct audio outputs and onboard sound generation puts Jammy in front of the competitors in terms of autonomous play.There’s no accounting for taste, but Jammy is arguably the most stylish of them all, too, and it definitely tells far more distinct rock’n’roll story than any other MIDI guitar.
 


 
Jammy’s iOS and Android compatible mobile app allows you to use the metronome, switch the type of the guitar, change the tuning, adjust the FX parameters and configure the FX chain to achieve the desired sound.It also provides you with the backing tracks in different genres, displaying the range of notes you can use to jam along to those tracks.
  Our team has a track of successful projects we helped bring to life as a RnD lab. But this time we decided to make something on our own behalf.Since the half our team of a bit more than 20 guys and ladies are guitar players themselves, the choice was obvious. As many of you here, we weren’t huge fans of inconveniences our standard-sized guitars caused us during the transportation.Neither were we satisfied with the extremely poor sound range of the available portable guitars. So we decide to create Jammy. Now, as Jammy’s got a 15-fret neck, will it be comfy to carry aroundThe longest part of Jammy is still only 17” long, which means Jammy Guitar fits into most of the backpacks. It also complies with the airlines’ carry-on regulations.Since Jammy consists of two parts, will the attachment be sturdy enough to endure the playing and transportation?It certainly will be. Our engineers paid special attention to that matter. The team has studied various industrial mechanisms which allowed us to come up with a super-durable solution.Will I be able to adjust the strings tension on Jammy Guitar?The new design allows for adjusting the tension so the strings felt as loose or tight as you want them to.  Is bending, hammer-ons, pull-offs and palm muting available on Jammy? Yes! All of that is possible thanks to touch, velocity and pressure sensors in the strings and frets. Can I use alternate tunings on Jammy? Jammy is a MIDI guitar, so we can change tuning pretty easily with just a few taps in our companion appAre there any Duties, Taxes or VAT included in the pricing? No, these are not included in the cost of shipping or handling of your order, and we are unable to estimate those fees for you and are not able to pay those on your behalf. Please check with your local customs agency for details on estimated costs.A huge THANK YOU to all the early adopters who believed in us from the very start, to all the people who helped us spread the word, gave valuable feedback, and kept us motivated to work our axes out delivering the best we can!",40.0,3,"1 Campaign

Thanks to the exclusive wireless module operating at 5.8 GHz, Zone 2 Speakers and Subwoofer connect to the Main Speakers wirelessly, with minimal interference and latency.

 --- NEW REVIEW! «The M6 system is unique in that you don’t need a receiver to control the system. You merely sync all the speakers together in a way similar to syncing up a wireless controller to an Xbox. The set up is remarkably simple and also gives you several options for connecting to various sources.»Ease of use: ✔️Flexibility: ✔️Outstanding audio: ✔️M6 checked all the boxes in the latest review by Magnetic Magazine, the e-zine that combines social media, culture, style and music ?But not only movies or music: M6 proved its value in gaming as well! Want to know more? Check out the full review ➡️ https://bit.ly/2AIx9Zv --- In this technology-driven era, with all that multimedia content available anytime, we all desired to own a system that could let us enjoy our favourite playlist or TV series easily, even if just for a few minutes. Most of the times, however, the dream gets crushed by bulky equipment, puzzling wiring, and never-ending installation and configuration processes.  Does enjoying our favourite music or movie really have to be so complicated and time-consuming? Now that most technologies are evolving towards more intuitive and user-friendly approaches, why should Hi-Fi be any different? Introducing:  Hassle-free installation, crystal-clear sound, intuitive interface—all without annoying cables or bulky equipment. Introducing the first Hi-Fi audio system that makes it superbly simple to get high-quality sound from all your entertainment devices.Everything’s set up in minutes.  Full review Full review Full review   Now, it's time to introduce you the 8 best reasons why M6 could be the only piece of equipment you'll ever need in your entertainment room. M6 is a multi-speaker stereo system. The basic set-up is a 2.1 configuration, which features a pair of Main Speakers and a wireless Subwoofer. To that, you can add up to two wireless Zone 2 pairs. Thanks to the exclusive wireless module operating at 5.8 GHz, Zone 2 Speakers and Subwoofer connect to the Main Speakers wirelessly, with minimal interference and latency. Plus, the transmission range reaches up to 20 m, providing you with multiple arrangements options.  Simply plug in the power and connect the speakers. No wires between the pairs, no extra connections. You no longer need to spend the weekend running messy cables through the ceiling or walls to connect the satellites, or the evening trying to figure out how to hide them: they simply won't be there.  Forget those bulky amplifiers or receivers. M6’s speakers are active, meaning you can connect your wired inputs directly to the back of the main pair’s master speaker. With such a clean and minimal set-up with practically no cables to manage, it’s a dream come true for sound lovers!    The M6 system has optical, coaxial, USB-C, AUX, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth inputs, allowing you to effortlessly connect up any device whether it’s a TV, PC, smartphone or turntable. No matter which device you choose, M6 connects to deliver the sound.Switch source easily with the push of a button. No more puzzling settings or labyrinthine navigation menus.  Choose the configuration that best suits your environment or personal preferences.  The 2.1 set-up will give new life to your favourite songs, with a clean and balanced sound. Movies, TV series and sports matches also benefit from clearer voices and a more distinct bass performance. Recommended for areas of up to 65 sq.m.With the 4.1 set-up, you get all the benefits of the 2.1 solution but with an even more immersive experience, comparable to that of surround systems. Take full advantage of the Live or Movie modes and enjoy live performances or movies and TV series, as if you were right there on the spot. Recommended for areas of up to 100 sq.m.The 6.1 set-up gives you a full-on entertainment experience. You can arrange the additional speakers in different spots of the room—or even in a different room—to let everyone enjoy the audio content the way it was intended. Recommended for areas of up to 130 sq.m.The wireless Zone 2 Speakers can be added at a later date. Choose the set-up that suits your needs now, and scale it up to 6.1 by adding the Zone 2 Speakers when you want them.  Also, the volume of Zone 2 Speakers can be adjusted to any level separately. Turn it to 0 to temporarily scale your system down to a standard 2.1 set-up.  The Front Speakers can be placed either vertically or combined together to form a single stereo soundbar. The soundstage will be just as accurate and the built-in G-sensor will automatically flip the LED display to the new orientation. Enjoy the great sound quality and the convenient user interface with both configurations. Get the rich clear sounds with a simple operation: Power-Source-Play.   Before even starting with features and specs, we would like to let M6 itself do the talking: sit back and enjoy this playlist we prepared to give you a glimpse of its audio quality and power. All clips are unedited. Please note that this is a stereo recording: to enhance the listening experience, please wear your headphones/earphones.

The symmetrical configuration of the drivers allows for an on-axis response to give you the sound and stereo imagery the way they were really intended.  By preserving phase integrity and matching dispersion, the speakers deliver an improved soundstage. Sit back and picture the positions of every musician as if you were right there, in front of the stage.  Designed and made to blend seamlessly with the satellite speakers, the wireless subwoofer lets the system deliver the full, harmonious sounds of floor-standing speakers.  You no longer need to adjust the layout of your room to accommodate the audio system. With its sleek design, the subwoofer itself adds value to your environments.  Behind the soft grille, a discrete LED display to give you all the information you need without disrupting your listening experience.  Everything is at your fingertips, with the intuitive and essential remote control.  Enhance live performances, movies, games and sports matches with the algorithmic 3D listening modes and advanced customization options such as bass, treble and balance.  This was our goal when we developed M6. We adjusted the cabinet and the internal configuration over and over again, taking every opportunity to reduce the size of the speakers without compromising on sound quality. At the same time, we made installation and operation easier by providing wireless connection, scalable configuration and hassle-free source switching.  Most audio equipment features a black or dark finish. However, we have all wished—at least once—to own a system that could give our entertainment room a brighter and more intimate look.Unveiling the silver white M6.  With its pearl-blasted aluminium case, anodized in carefully selected hues, this version is mesmerizing to the touch and shimmering to the eye.       Our goal is to create products which are both intuitive to use and blend in well with the surroundings. When tuning our speakers, first and foremost, we put sound performance and the interaction between sound and the environment. We strive to design devices that will stand the test of time so that they may be your life companions well into the future.Our manufacturing techniques aim to uphold the authentic texture of materials, allowing their properties to stand out. We deliver a refreshing blend of contemporary and traditional elements through the combination of different materials and details. The essential and classic aesthetics of our speakers blend gracefully with any style.Named after the two daughters of the founder of the company, CELIA & PERAH represents more than just quality audio engineering. The name is a sign of commitment of the designer to our customers and symbolises how much we care about our products and the experience listeners derive from them.  M2—The Inspiring Moment 2013.01       CELIA & PERAH is founded2014.10       Launch of P4 Wireless Bentwood Hi-Fi Speaker // Shown at Hong Kong Electronics Fair2014.12       Launch of P3 Wireless Bentwood Hi-Fi speaker // Shown at The Original Festival, Taipei - Taiwan2015.01       Sales begin at Eslite bookstore2015.03       Winner of the 2015 Red Dot Design Award2015.04       Sales begin at HOLA furnishing store // Shown at The Creative Expo Taiwan2015.10       Winner of the 2015 Golden Pin Design Award2016.02       Shown at Ambiente - The Show, Frankfurt - Germany2016.03       Launch of P3 II Wireless Hi-Fi Speaker2016.04       Shown at The Creative Expo Taiwan // Winner of the Cultural and Creativity Award 20162016.05       Shown at Computex Taipei2016.07       Sales begin at Le Bon Marché2016.08       Sales begin at Galeries Lafayette Haussmann2016.09       Sales begin at The Lalu Hotel Qingdao // Shown at Maison & Objet, Paris - France2016.11       Sales begin at HomeGoods furnishing store2017.02       Shown at Ambiente - The Show, Frankfurt - Germany2017.04       Shown at The Creative Expo Taiwan2017.05       Launch of M2 Wireless Hi-Fi Speaker // Shown at Beijing Music & Life Show2017.09       Shown at Tokyo International Gift Show LIFE×DESIGN // Winner of the Best Technology Award2018.09       Shown at Maison & Objet, Paris - France2018.10       Shown at STYLE Bangkok Fair        All the perks has been sent, thanks for the support For the first time installation, please refer to below video We worked on M6 for nearly 30 months before launching this campaign and did our best to ensure delivery reached your doorstep in the shortest time possible.Our experience in designing and launching wireless speakers dates back to 2013.

Big Sound. Small Speaker. You can take WOW to the park, the beach, on holiday, to work.
 You need WOW wherever you need your music.
 Compact, durable, wireless, easy to connect and recharge, WOW makes all your music portable. Big on sound, WOW wirelessly streams music from any Bluetooth device.
 
We took WOW to the streets ... here is what people had to say https://vimeo.com/45596719

 
KAKKOii (Japanese: cool / awesome)
KAKKOii is a boutique design company set up by Antonio Arevalo.
A London designer, Antonio's passion is making innovative, high quality products that fit the urban lifestyle; WOW is the first in the KAKKOii range.
Antonio’s been designing products for clients for over 12 years, but KAKKOii is his own brand and he needs your help to share WOW with the world.
Why WOW needs you
The goal (listed over in the top right hand corner) represents the amount of money KAKKOii needs to pay for tooling, certificate fees (FCC and TELEC) and the minimum number of units to get WOW into production.
If you pre-order WOW you’ll get it at a big discount as well as the feel good feeling of being a pioneer that made our WOW dream a reality.
If we reach our goal the first batch of WOW will ship at the end of October.
 
WOW features / specs:
-       Bluetooth connection up to 10-meter (33-foot) wireless range
-       Built in rechargeable battery (recharged via USB) 
-       up to 4-6 hour play time, depending on the settings and environmental conditions. 
-       70 decibel power output (enough to fill a big size room or annoy the neighbour) 
-       Made from silicon for durability (accidentally falling-from-shelf-proof)
-       Auto silence mode when you have an incoming call and auto play when you finish taking your call 
 
 
 
-       Stand upright to get a 360 degree sound or lay down for more directional sound 
 
-       Wirelessly streams music from any Bluetooth-enabled device such as your mobile phone, notebook, iPhone or iPad.

-       WOW is available in RED (185*), BLUE (3005*), BLACK, WHITE and YELLOW (109*) - * Pantone reference
 
 
Can I help in other ways? 
Sure thing... spread the word; tell your friends, family and foes! Share our campaign on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Pinterest, blog…. everywhere.
Thank you for your support,
Antonio and the KAKKOii gang

<h2>#WirSindUbahnStars</h2>
<p>Hallo ihr Lieben, </p>
<p>seit bald 3 Jahren spielen die U-Bahn-Stars in den Stationen der Wiener Linien und verschönern euren Tag mit Musik.</p>
<p>Durch die Folgen des Covid-19 Ausbruchs finden keinerlei Auftritte in den Stationen mehr statt und auch bereits geplante Konzerte wurden abgesagt. Für viele der U-Bahn-Stars stellt dies einen erheblichen Einkommensverlust dar - vermutlich für einen längeren Zeitraum.</p>
<p>Aber wir lieben die Musik und wollen daher die Konzerte aus den U-Bahn-Stationen zu euch in die Wohnzimmer bringen. Auf der Facebook-Fanpage der U-Bahn-Stars: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Ubahnstars/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/Ubahnstars/</a> werden daher regelmäßig Videos der verschiedenen KünstlerInnen gepostet - nicht nur Musik, sondern viele Überraschungen! Durch das Crowdfunding erhoffen wir uns, dass wir unsere laufenden Kosten für die Wohnungen ausgleichen können, damit wir uns voll auf die Musik konzentrieren können und euch auch weiterhin den Alltag versüßen können. Das Spendenziel von 52.000€ ergibt sich folglich aus den 130 TeilnehmerInnen und deren 400€ durchschnittliche monatl. Fixkosten. Der eingenommene Betrag wird unter allen teilnehmenden U-Bahn-Stars fair aufgeteilt.</p>

<p><strong>BlueDAC</strong> builds upon the legacy of our award-winning portable audio products and adds the most requested features: Rechargeable Battery and Bluetooth Input. It comes from our team's years of experience in Audio Research and Development. </p>
</div><p>This is our most advanced Personal D/A Converter and Amplifier, period. It will make your phones, tablets and computers sound their best without wires or draining their battery!</p><p> </p><h3>What's wrong with my phone's headphone jack?</h3><p>You like going places and listening to music. You pack lightly when you travel, because it’s all about the experience and ease. You don't want to carry a separate music player for two reasons: First, they are expensive, and Second, you already have your phone! So, you load your music onto your phone, pack your favorite headphones and go!</p><p>But, when you plug your awesome headphones into your phone, something’s not right. Something's missing from your music. It sounds caged-in. It lacks impact, clarity, and emotion. Your music just isn't ALIVE. And these days, what's missing is the <strong>headphone jack</strong> itself.</p><p>The truth is that phones, laptops and tablets aren't designed by musicians and your phone is not an audiophile device! It was designed with the average consumer in mind, so it includes mid-grade parts to save costs. What a bummer! You hear the sound quality difference, and this gets very frustrating! </p><p>Fortunately, there is an answer.</p><p>It’s called BlueDAC and it comes from CEntrance, a leader in personal audio. For the last 17 years we've built equipment for recording studios, performance stages and broadcast facilities worldwide. We've designed mixing consoles, recording equipment, and home stereo systems for music professionals – the most demanding ears out there.</p><p>BlueDAC is the answer to bad portable sound. We packaged an awesome audio system inside a small but durable case! Now you can listen to music in a whole new way using your phone, tablet, laptop or desktop. BlueDAC will breathe new LIFE into your music.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491524215/b0p7yhrtlqukmfl1r2uo.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p>We make it easy to listen to music in high definition. Rediscover your own music collection, or enjoy streaming from Tidal, Spotify, Slacker, Pandora, and many others. Now you can access amazing audio quality at a truly affordable price!</p><p> </p><h3>A Bit of History</h3><p>In 2009 CEntrance was the trailblazer. We made audio history with the release of a revolutionary product called <strong>DACport</strong>. It defined the cutting edge in portable Hi-Fi and single-handedly created a new product category. <strong>DACport</strong>, a cigar-shaped D/A converter and headphone amplifier, delivered audiophile sound to any high-end headphones and gave thousands of people access to high-quality music.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491524276/a4tcoipp3rzswqm5yyhc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p>DACport's amazing sound earned it a place on Stereophile magazine's highly coveted ""Recommended Components List"" for 6+ years. It was featured on the cover and received numerous industry awards. This is unmatched by any other brand! Here is what Stereophile's John Atkinson had to say about DACport:</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491524309/dkzb5vsmvvypyef3zq5s.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>      <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491524314/jmm4rrj1gsplnx6m9ppo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><h3>A Classic, Remixed</h3><p>Later, an updated version called DACport HD added High-Resolution audio and became smaller, lighter, and more ergonomic. DACport HD was crowdfunded right here on Indiegogo and sold thousands of units within months of introduction. </p><p>  </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491524357/tnjj186zx4lgm6rgejlq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Here is what our customers said about DACport HD:</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;""><i>The quality of my listening experience from Spotify with the M&amp;D headphone paired with DACport HD is truly awe-inspiring. I cannot emphasize enough how amazing and how truly impressed and blown-away I am with the sound from DACport HD!</i></p><p style=""margin-left:480px;""><i>Dominique James</i></p><p>CEntrance released many exciting recording and playback products. Products such as MicPort Pro and AxePort Pro, endorsed by the Hollywood elite. Products such as <strong>DACmini</strong> and <strong>HiFi-M8</strong>, named ""<strong>Best DAC Ever Tested</strong>"" by CNET:</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491524424/a3ysgbfve4u8mn7avrbs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><h3><strong>Introducing BlueDAC</strong></h3><p>Today we are excited to introduce our <strong>most advanced portable DAC/Amp</strong>. The battery-powered <strong>BlueDAC</strong>. This is what our customers have been waiting for.</p><p>People with phones and tablets love to listen to music. But no one wants to carry around additional equipment, such as amps and battery packs. Our quality-minded customers demanded a self-powered DAC/Amp. Today, we are proud to deliver.</p><p>Gone are external batteries. Gone are amplifier stacks. <strong>BlueDAC </strong>simplifies everything! Small and lightweight, jam-packed with Sonic Goodness, <strong>BlueDAC </strong>does it all. And yet, it's extremely travel-friendly. As frequent travelers ourselves, we designed it to pack well. Most importantly, this amp is really loud! Your headphones will be happy, and so will you!</p><p> </p><p>The CEntrance design team is known for its work with semiconductor leaders such as Texas Instruments, XMOS and AKM. We are listed on their websites as an official 3-rd party design firm. We have helped over 100 consulting clients such as Benchmark, Lavry, McIntosh, and Korg deliver great audio products to market.</p><p>When developing <strong>BlueDAC</strong>, CEntrance has taken advantage of our special relationships and utilized modern approaches to portable power and audiophile sound quality. Major advances in technology allowed us to achieve further miniaturization and sonic improvements. We put Hi-Fi in the palm of your hand.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What Does it Work With?</strong></p><p><strong>BlueDAC </strong>is designed to support a wide variety of digital sources, from laptops to desktops, to tablets, to phones, and even TVs. That's on the wireless side. You can use the wired connection for highest audio quality, up to DSD when used as  a USB DAC.</p><p>The unit is plug-and-play on Mac OS and we have drivers for Windows. Linux and newer Android devices are supported out of the box. You really cannot go wrong with <strong>BlueDAC</strong>. It will bring sweet music to your ears, no matter what you use for playback at work, at home, or in between.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Features</strong></h3><p>Just like in our flagship products, we used high-quality, audiophile-grade components such as resistors, amplifiers and power supplies to dramatically raise the bar on sound quality. <strong>BlueDAC</strong> makes it possible to truly enjoy hi-res files on your phone. Here are the main features:</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491524666/ndhcpqywyp1pv7pbkcu6.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>Performance Parts</strong></p><ul><li>
<i>Most Awesome Headphone Amp</i>. Clean, quiet and powerful Amp Extreme™, ""The best amp ever"", according to CNET.</li></ul><ul><li>
<i>Balanced outputs. Highlight the Bass and treble!</i>  Enjoy the silky-smooth high frequency sounds and punchy bass via the 2.5mm balanced connection, or the regular 3.5mm jack.</li></ul><ul><li>

No problem! We don't mind sharing. </p><p><strong>Upgraded Power</strong></p><p>BlueDAC takes 5V from a USB charger and filters the living daylights out of it before it gets to the audio circuitry, to make sure all noise is kept out of your music. Internally, BlueDAC has seven power supplies and multiple filter stages, creating different voltages to power its high-end digital and analog circuitry.</p><p><strong>Upgraded Amp</strong></p><p>During the very successful HiFi-Skyn design effort, we developed Amp Extreme, a headphone amplifier circuit that delivers high power and ultra low distortion, making headphones sing loud and clear. BlueDAC has Amp Extreme built in! </p><p><strong>Upgraded DAC</strong></p><p>BlueDAC also shares the DAC chip with HiFi-Skyn. We use the brand new AK4490 from AKM. CEntrance is an official 3-rd party developer for AKM, so not only do we have access to best parts, but we also know how to use them.  Analog circuitry is known as ""black art"", but we've perfected it over the last 15 years.</p><p><strong>Upgraded USB</strong></p><p>The asynchronous USB interface is handled by the brand new XMOS U8 chip. CEntrance is also a 3-rd party development house for XMOS. We help them build their parts into other companies' products and this gives us unprecedented level of support straight from the chip developers. Naturally, you can depend on CEntrance tech.</p><p> </p><h3>Designed For Any Headphones</h3><p>Some headphone models remain customer favorites due to their special sonic signature. Yet, these headphones are not efficient enough to be driven directly from the cell phone. A powerful amplifier is needed. And the amp needs a power supply. This is why die-hard audiophiles carry stacks of gear—batteries, DACs, and amps:</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491526837/qcai204k3dsi5bktxqoa.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>BlueDAC</strong> changes all that. Our past products were powered from USB. But the amount of USB power is limited, making it hard to achieve really loud output. In such products we always had to make compromises on output power. Now that we have an internal battery, we can really amp it up for most demanding headphones. BlueDAC pumps out enough power to drive almost anything!</p><p> </p><h3>Which Headphones should I use?</h3><p>We get that question a lot. You are in luck. You can use pretty much any high-end headphones. Because BlueDAC has a powerful headphone amp, it will match up not just with the ultra-sensitive IEMs, but also with the high-end models from AKG, Audeze, Beyerdynamic, Fostex, HiFi-Man, Master and Dynamic, Mr. Speakers, Sennheiser, and many others. Very few DAC/Amps can boast this kind of performance, but BlueDAC can! And now, thanks to user feedback, we are also offering balanced headphone connection, along with the standard 3.5mm headphone jack. That's two ways to listen to music!<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491526945/rhiy7yzlh0x6mmjgicj3.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>We engineered BlueDAC to take the digital signal out of your phone, tablet of computer, process it and convert it to analog using the same technology found in our award-winning audiophile products, and amplify it to a powerful, crystal-clear signal that will drive any headphones, with pristine highs and powerful bass.</p><p>The CEntrance BlueDAC is also an awesome USB sound card inside a small lightweight case. It delivers your music in unmatched audio fidelity and on top of that, packs a long-lasting battery! BlueDAC is perfect for those extended shifts at work, while working out, on long flights, or at home, when you need some quality tunes but the phone's own buzzy sound just wouldn't cut it.</p><p> </p><h3>Your iPhone is no Match for Your Cool Cans</h3><p>The smartphone is a great digital music player, but its headphone jack sucks! You may have awesome headphones, but your iPhone won’t get the best out of them—the sound will be muddy, lack clarity and punch, to say nothing about feeble bass.<br/>If you are into audio quality, these headphones are the real deal. But your iPhone doesn't support these headphones. That's the problem we solve with BlueDAC.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491525170/bzkpmzruqi9yzosbrmmy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>Who We Are </h3><p>CEntrance owes its reputation to thousands of happy customers, all around the world.

BlueDAC builds upon the legacy of our award-winning portable audio products and adds the most requested features: Rechargeable Battery and Bluetooth Input. It comes from our team's years of experience in Audio Research and Development. 
This is our most advanced Personal D/A Converter and Amplifier, period. It will make your phones, tablets and computers sound their best without wires or draining their battery! What's wrong with my phone's headphone jack?You like going places and listening to music. You pack lightly when you travel, because it’s all about the experience and ease. You don't want to carry a separate music player for two reasons: First, they are expensive, and Second, you already have your phone! So, you load your music onto your phone, pack your favorite headphones and go!But, when you plug your awesome headphones into your phone, something’s not right. Something's missing from your music. It sounds caged-in. It lacks impact, clarity, and emotion. Your music just isn't ALIVE. And these days, what's missing is the headphone jack itself.The truth is that phones, laptops and tablets aren't designed by musicians and your phone is not an audiophile device! It was designed with the average consumer in mind, so it includes mid-grade parts to save costs. What a bummer! You hear the sound quality difference, and this gets very frustrating! Fortunately, there is an answer.It’s called BlueDAC and it comes from CEntrance, a leader in personal audio. For the last 17 years we've built equipment for recording studios, performance stages and broadcast facilities worldwide. We've designed mixing consoles, recording equipment, and home stereo systems for music professionals – the most demanding ears out there.BlueDAC is the answer to bad portable sound. We packaged an awesome audio system inside a small but durable case! Now you can listen to music in a whole new way using your phone, tablet, laptop or desktop. BlueDAC will breathe new LIFE into your music.  We make it easy to listen to music in high definition. Rediscover your own music collection, or enjoy streaming from Tidal, Spotify, Slacker, Pandora, and many others. Now you can access amazing audio quality at a truly affordable price! A Bit of HistoryIn 2009 CEntrance was the trailblazer. We made audio history with the release of a revolutionary product called DACport. It defined the cutting edge in portable Hi-Fi and single-handedly created a new product category. DACport, a cigar-shaped D/A converter and headphone amplifier, delivered audiophile sound to any high-end headphones and gave thousands of people access to high-quality music.  DACport's amazing sound earned it a place on Stereophile magazine's highly coveted ""Recommended Components List"" for 6+ years. It was featured on the cover and received numerous industry awards. This is unmatched by any other brand! Here is what Stereophile's John Atkinson had to say about DACport:        A Classic, RemixedLater, an updated version called DACport HD added High-Resolution audio and became smaller, lighter, and more ergonomic. DACport HD was crowdfunded right here on Indiegogo and sold thousands of units within months of introduction.    Here is what our customers said about DACport HD:The quality of my listening experience from Spotify with the M&D headphone paired with DACport HD is truly awe-inspiring. I cannot emphasize enough how amazing and how truly impressed and blown-away I am with the sound from DACport HD!Dominique JamesCEntrance released many exciting recording and playback products. Products such as MicPort Pro and AxePort Pro, endorsed by the Hollywood elite. Products such as DACmini and HiFi-M8, named ""Best DAC Ever Tested"" by CNET:  Introducing BlueDACToday we are excited to introduce our most advanced portable DAC/Amp. The battery-powered BlueDAC. This is what our customers have been waiting for.People with phones and tablets love to listen to music. But no one wants to carry around additional equipment, such as amps and battery packs. Our quality-minded customers demanded a self-powered DAC/Amp. Today, we are proud to deliver.Gone are external batteries. Gone are amplifier stacks. BlueDAC simplifies everything! Small and lightweight, jam-packed with Sonic Goodness, BlueDAC does it all. And yet, it's extremely travel-friendly. As frequent travelers ourselves, we designed it to pack well. Most importantly, this amp is really loud! Your headphones will be happy, and so will you! The CEntrance design team is known for its work with semiconductor leaders such as Texas Instruments, XMOS and AKM. We are listed on their websites as an official 3-rd party design firm. We have helped over 100 consulting clients such as Benchmark, Lavry, McIntosh, and Korg deliver great audio products to market.When developing BlueDAC, CEntrance has taken advantage of our special relationships and utilized modern approaches to portable power and audiophile sound quality. Major advances in technology allowed us to achieve further miniaturization and sonic improvements. We put Hi-Fi in the palm of your hand. What Does it Work With?BlueDAC is designed to support a wide variety of digital sources, from laptops to desktops, to tablets, to phones, and even TVs. That's on the wireless side. You can use the wired connection for highest audio quality, up to DSD when used as  a USB DAC.The unit is plug-and-play on Mac OS and we have drivers for Windows. Linux and newer Android devices are supported out of the box. You really cannot go wrong with BlueDAC. It will bring sweet music to your ears, no matter what you use for playback at work, at home, or in between. FeaturesJust like in our flagship products, we used high-quality, audiophile-grade components such as resistors, amplifiers and power supplies to dramatically raise the bar on sound quality. BlueDAC makes it possible to truly enjoy hi-res files on your phone. Here are the main features:  Performance Parts
Most Awesome Headphone Amp. Clean, quiet and powerful Amp Extreme™, ""The best amp ever"", according to CNET.
Balanced outputs. Highlight the Bass and treble!  Enjoy the silky-smooth high frequency sounds and punchy bass via the 2.5mm balanced connection, or the regular 3.5mm jack.
Amazingly Musical DAC. Our premium, Velvet Sound DAC from AKM is used in the world's most expensive recording and playback gear.
Digital Volume Control with 256 precision steps. Volume control with digital tracking keeps channels in perfect balance, always. Technical InnovationsA Li-Po rechargeable battery delivers 20 hours* of sweet music to your ears.Seven regulated internal power supplies provide full isolation from noise.USB input is the charging port: Charge the internal battery, while playing music!Two Picosecond clocks with JitterGuard™, our jitter removal technology.Two output level settings - LOW for Line output and HIGH for Headphones.Dual Input lets you listen without wires on the go, or via USB for best quality. Under the HoodYou are probably wondering what's under the hood. No problem! We don't mind sharing. Upgraded PowerBlueDAC takes 5V from a USB charger and filters the living daylights out of it before it gets to the audio circuitry, to make sure all noise is kept out of your music. Internally, BlueDAC has seven power supplies and multiple filter stages, creating different voltages to power its high-end digital and analog circuitry.Upgraded AmpDuring the very successful HiFi-Skyn design effort, we developed Amp Extreme, a headphone amplifier circuit that delivers high power and ultra low distortion, making headphones sing loud and clear. BlueDAC has Amp Extreme built in! Upgraded DACBlueDAC also shares the DAC chip with HiFi-Skyn. We use the brand new AK4490 from AKM. CEntrance is an official 3-rd party developer for AKM, so not only do we have access to best parts, but we also know how to use them.  Analog circuitry is known as ""black art"", but we've perfected it over the last 15 years.Upgraded USBThe asynchronous USB interface is handled by the brand new XMOS U8 chip. CEntrance is also a 3-rd party development house for XMOS. We help them build their parts into other companies' products and this gives us unprecedented level of support straight from the chip developers. Naturally, you can depend on CEntrance tech. Designed For Any HeadphonesSome headphone models remain customer favorites due to their special sonic signature. Yet, these headphones are not efficient enough to be driven directly from the cell phone. A powerful amplifier is needed. And the amp needs a power supply. This is why die-hard audiophiles carry stacks of gear—batteries, DACs, and amps:  BlueDAC changes all that. Our past products were powered from USB. But the amount of USB power is limited, making it hard to achieve really loud output. In such products we always had to make compromises on output power. Now that we have an internal battery, we can really amp it up for most demanding headphones. BlueDAC pumps out enough power to drive almost anything! Which Headphones should I use?We get that question a lot. You are in luck. You can use pretty much any high-end headphones. Because BlueDAC has a powerful headphone amp, it will match up not just with the ultra-sensitive IEMs, but also with the high-end models from AKG, Audeze, Beyerdynamic, Fostex, HiFi-Man, Master and Dynamic, Mr. Speakers, Sennheiser, and many others. Very few DAC/Amps can boast this kind of performance, but BlueDAC can! And now, thanks to user feedback, we are also offering balanced headphone connection, along with the standard 3.5mm headphone jack. That's two ways to listen to music!We engineered BlueDAC to take the digital signal out of your phone, tablet of computer, process it and convert it to analog using the same technology found in our award-winning audiophile products, and amplify it to a powerful, crystal-clear signal that will drive any headphones, with pristine highs and powerful bass.The CEntrance BlueDAC is also an awesome USB sound card inside a small lightweight case. It delivers your music in unmatched audio fidelity and on top of that, packs a long-lasting battery! BlueDAC is perfect for those extended shifts at work, while working out, on long flights, or at home, when you need some quality tunes but the phone's own buzzy sound just wouldn't cut it. Your iPhone is no Match for Your Cool CansThe smartphone is a great digital music player, but its headphone jack sucks! You may have awesome headphones, but your iPhone won’t get the best out of them—the sound will be muddy, lack clarity and punch, to say nothing about feeble bass.If you are into audio quality, these headphones are the real deal. But your iPhone doesn't support these headphones. That's the problem we solve with BlueDAC.   Who We Are CEntrance owes its reputation to thousands of happy customers, all around the world. Starting out as designers behind today's famous audio brands, CEntrance now has many products on the market.

Modeled after a circuit that emulates the sounds of a V8 motor, the Nuisance Engine is an abrasive noise box with a mind of its own, capturing the coveted quality of unpredictable yet clear results from user input. The signal flow consists of a square wave oscillator exciting a variable frequency resonator filter, which then passes through a combination lowpass filter / distortion circuit that cranks in incredible amounts of gain as the filter cutoff decreases, creating a decidedly smushy, crushy end result. This all runs into an audiophile unfriendly Class B amplifier circuit so cheap that it ducks the power supply of the entire device in the process of driving the built-in speaker, leading to some weird, chaotic feedback magic that makes the NE-1 the Nuisance it is. Perfect for irritating your friends and enemies on the go...</p><p>Technical jargon and hyperbole aside, I designed a cool thing. I put a lot of time and love into the project, and I build each one of them by hand. The circuit is fun and unique, and captures the absolute best qualities of a noise synthesizer: harsh, wacky unpredictability combined with clear results from your input. It's an illogical system that you can learn to navigate. It runs off a 9V battery (or a 9V wall wart supply), it has a built-in speaker, and the enclosure is made of durable aluminum, making it perfect for noisemaking on the go. It also has a 3.5mm output and control voltage input, meaning that it plays nice with other synth/studio gear. The engineering inside is a work of beauty, and something I feel very proud of.

For a limited time, you can get a Nuisance Engine of your very own for the discount price of $80 (later this price will go up to $100). All the money I raise will go towards purchasing the enclosures, circuit boards, and electrical components.

<p><b>Philipp Sonnleitner</b> founded Mikme so that content creators such as artists, video makers and podcasters could focus on making music, videos and recording audio wherever they are.</p>
<p>As a creative and musician, Philipp was frustrated by how long it took him to record a new idea or song. Setting up microphones in front of his acoustic piano, connecting cables, setting up sound cards and recording software simply took too long.</p>
<p>Before leaving his job to make Mikme, Philipp was a software engineer and product manager at AKG—the legendary Austrian microphone and headphone manufacturer— for 8 years.</p>

Is Mikme the GoPro of Microphones?by Joel Johnson - Fast Company

""The secret to great video is audio. In an age where your cameraphone shoots video that isn't just good enough, but actually pretty great, the tinny, flat sound that accompanies most videos remains the starkest difference between amateur and pro. Where's the GoPro or iPhone for audio?
Well, it might be Mikme.""



Mikme microphone promises studio quality sound in a tiny packageby Derek Walter - Macworld
 

 

​""...when Mikme played back a variety of recordings, ranging from interviews to music, I was impressed.​""​


 


Mikme’s Tiny Wireless Microphone Could Change Our Expectations for Quality Audio Anywhereby Jaron Schneider - Resource Magazine 


""Audio can be baffling, challenging and expensive. If you aren’t sure what you’re doing, you end up with sound that is akin to hearing a conversation through a tin can in a Miami club. “Good” audio equipment is expensive and doesn’t guarantee results. Well, that was the case until Mikme. I spent some time with the attractive little box and its creator, Philipp Sonnleitner, and have seen (or rather, heard) what it is capable of… and I was impressed.​""​

Meet Mikme's Creator, Phillip   
Philipp Sonnleitner founded Mikme so that content creators such as artists, video makers and podcasters could focus on making music, videos and recording audio wherever they are.
As a creative and musician, Philipp was frustrated by how long it took him to record a new idea or song. Setting up microphones in front of his acoustic piano, connecting cables, setting up sound cards and recording software simply took too long.
Before leaving his job to make Mikme, Philipp was a software engineer and product manager at AKG—the legendary Austrian microphone and headphone manufacturer— for 8 years.
 
 
 
Meet the Team
 
   Together, with Josef Scheider (Former head of mechanical design at AKG for 20+ years), Alex Pohl (Lead designer), Richard Pribyl (former lead acoustic engineer at AKG for 35+ years) and Manuel Gattinger (Industrial designer) we brought this project to life.Mikme consists of a passionate team of 15 designers, musicians and engineers who  brought more than 150 successful, world-class audio products to market. Such as studio  microphones and studio/consumer headphones, wireless microphones and Bluetooth speakers for companies such as AKG, JBL, Samsung, Audi, BMW and others.In sum we hold 80+ patents and won 40+ design awards. Design and engineering takes place in Austria, Germany, Netherlands, Serbia and the USA. Mikme will be manufactured in Germany. Please contact us if you have feedback, ideas or anything else that could make Mikme even better: hello@mikme.comThank you!    
 
Why We Need Your Help
 
 
 
 We have working prototypes which are recording crystal clear audio and are transmitting audio securely and reliable through our Mikme Lost & Found wireless link.
The free Mikme App is available on the Apple App store already. It works standalone using the iPhone's internal microphone and other external microphones. So you can try it already and see what we are building.
Now to get manufacturing done we need your help. We need at least $25.000 to get a minimum order quantity to order the first pieces of Mikme from our contract manufacturer from Munich, Germany.
Support Mikme at Indiegogo and soon you'll be able to record audio with one button in studio-quality.

Risks and Challenges

 
Well, if there weren’t a risk we wouldn't be on Indiegogo.

We are a team of very experienced individuals who have gone through the product development process more than once (our team designed, developed and manufactured more than 150 products). Unforeseen things sometimes happen, but we are convinced that we can start manufacturing the first series in August/September 2016.
The biggest risk eliminator is the minimum-order-quantity. This is why we need funding of more than $25.000. Every additional cent makes it safer. We have already a contract manufacturer in Munich, Germany. Again, quantity is very important.
Once produced, we will stamp ""Made in Germany"" on each box, which reinforces constant production quality.

[Bluetooth] - So the audio is compressed, because 96k/24bits is 2304kbps which is beyond the capability of Bluetooth? Is it a lossless compression?96kHz can only be recorded locally. If you want to record wirelessly the sampling rate is switched to 44.1 kHz. The Mikme microphone is recording with with to 44.1 kHz/24bit and saves the raw wav files at its internal 16GB memory. At the same time we are encoding that file into a mp4 file with an aac encoder. This decreases the files size by roughly 10 times and that file is than streamed via bluetooth to the app. The app then process the mp4 files.We made quite a lot hearing tests with audio engineers, musicians and hifi guys to find out if that compression is good enough. We found out that the aac works really well and that it’s nearly impossible to distinguish between the original and compressed files. Most of the test persons, and these were audio pros, had no chance to tell the difference.If you still want to have the raw files you can transfer them from the mic via USB onto your computer for further processing. 

[Other] - What's the housing made of?The top and the bottom parts are plastic (need to be plastic so we get the wireless bluetooth connection in and out). It's high quality plastic.The main middle part of the frame is out of metal.",30.0,7,"3 Campaigns

<p>This is not our first crowdfunding campaign. When we launched our Kickstarter campaign in October last year, we hit our goal in just 24 hours, raising $18,000 in just three days. <strong>However, we canceled our campaign at that time even though the Kickstarter campaign was a promising and successful campaign…</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>Our team seeks to provide the world's most innovative audio equipment. Our designers and engineers have worked in the audio industry for <strong>over 10 years</strong>. We have seen and made many regular boxy speakers. We believe this should be <strong>totally different from the audio community </strong>and<strong> </strong>we strongly believe this innovative speaker should be developed together by our team and the community! </p>
<p>After our first pilot production in September 2018, we sent 20 samples to top audio experts, and attended the <i>100% Design London 2018 Exhibition </i>to<i> </i>gather feedbacks! People loved our design a lot.</p>

<p>We are so grateful to the GravaStar community who provided helpful comments and suggestions to help our product development. Special thanks go to <strong>Didier Vilas, and Oh Yeon Joong</strong> for their help in developing our products！</p>
<p>The first version of GravaStar scored 9 out of 10. Some of our Gravastar community thought it was a pity to cancel the KS campaign, but <strong>we want a 100% perfect innovative speaker for our community! </strong>That's why we canceled our KS campaign and improved our products for another 6 months. </p>
<p><strong>Now we are 100% confident in the improved GravaStar design! </strong>We have sent out <strong>200 review samples</strong> to top audio experts, gamers, and technologists, receiving all positive feedback! This is why we are confident to <strong>start mass production NOW</strong>! We will <strong>ship our first batch before the campaign ends</strong>. This time, GravaStar is not a general crowdfunding project. The GravaStar speaker is in its production stage so we will be ready to ship these to you very soon! <strong>The earlier you back our campaign, the sooner you will receive these very innovative speakers!</strong> No risk.  </p>

The Story of GravaStar

This is not our first crowdfunding campaign. When we launched our Kickstarter campaign in October last year, we hit our goal in just 24 hours, raising $18,000 in just three days. However, we canceled our campaign at that time even though the Kickstarter campaign was a promising and successful campaign…
Why?
Our team seeks to provide the world's most innovative audio equipment. Our designers and engineers have worked in the audio industry for over 10 years. We have seen and made many regular boxy speakers. We believe this should be totally different from the audio community and we strongly believe this innovative speaker should be developed together by our team and the community! 
After our first pilot production in September 2018, we sent 20 samples to top audio experts, and attended the 100% Design London 2018 Exhibition to gather feedbacks! People loved our design a lot.

We are so grateful to the GravaStar community who provided helpful comments and suggestions to help our product development. Special thanks go to Didier Vilas, and Oh Yeon Joong for their help in developing our products！

No risk.  
We chose Indiegogo instead of Kickstarter because Indiegogo allows us to ship our product sooner – something that Kickstarter does not support. We don't want our fans to wait for several more months!

How do I pre-order SoundBrake 2.0? </strong></p><p><strong>On Mobile:</strong> Click on your desired Perk in the PERKS section. You will then see the pink ""GET THIS PERK"" button appear at the bottom of the Perk box you clicked. Click on this button to get to checkout. </p><p><strong>On Desktop/Tablet: </strong>Click on your desired Perk in the PERKS section on the right side of the campaign page. This will bring you to the checkout page. </p><p>Please keep in mind during checkout:</p><ul>
<li>You must enter your zip code in the credit card info section, or there will be a checkout error. </li>
<li>Using auto-fill may cause a checkout error. </li>
</ul><p><strong>2. How can I use SoundBrake with wireless headphones?</strong></p><p>You can use SoundBrake with wireless headphones using a standalone wireless transmitter or Bluetooth transmitter module. Instead of plugging wired headphones into SoundBrake's audio jack, plug the wireless transmitter into the audio jack. Then pair your Bluetooth headphones with the transmitter. A Bluetooth transmitter module is included at a higher reward level.</p><p><strong>3. How is this different than headphones with built-in ambient modes?</strong></p><p>Headphones that have ""ambient"" or ""transparency"" modes to give you awareness of your surroundings let all outside sound pass through. This impacts your audio quality by removing your isolation and not allowing you to be fully immersed in your music. On the other hand, SoundBrake allows you to be fully isolated while still letting you clearly hear outside sounds louder than the alert level. </p><p>Furthermore, when you use ambient mode headphones, your music can still distract you from hearing outside sounds, especially at higher volumes. On the other hand,  SoundBrake alerts you by streaming in outside sound while temporarily silencing your audio, so you can be aware of the outside sound and clearly hear it.</p><p><strong>4. Is this different than using open air headphones?</strong></p><p>Unlike open air headphones, SoundBrake will not let all outside sound pass through to your headphones. There is no impact to your headphone audio and you will only hear outside sound when it is louder than the alert level.</p><p><strong>5. Will SoundBrake allow me to use my headphone's built-in controls?</strong></p><p>Yes! SoundBrake has a four conductor audio plug, which allows it to be used with the headphone's built in track/volume controls.</p><p><strong>6. What is SoundBrake's battery life?</strong></p><p>The rechargeable battery lasts for 50+ hours on a single charge.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Note about International Shipping:  </strong></p><p>International shipments may be subject to import taxes, customs duties, and fees levied by the destination country. We don't have control over these charges and you will be responsible for fulfilling them. When customs clearance procedures are required, it can cause a delay beyond our delivery estimate.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/yKHUU78VzxAg8/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></p></div>","First Production Run:

I'm very passionate about delivering a high quality product that will enhance your headphone experience.         In early 2016, Sundae Electronics produced SoundBrake Generation 1.0 as the result of a successfully funded Kickstarter campaign. SoundBrake 1.0 instantly silenced your audio to alert you of outside sounds. In addition to the industrial design and LED indicators, the major improvement of SoundBrake 2.0 is that outside sound is instantly streamed into your headphones so you can clearly hear outside sound above the alert level. Funds from this project will be used for:                                                       We can't wait to let all our supporters be the first to get it. Envy Creative (www.thinkenvy.com) did a great job with video production for our campaign video.  Calpak USA (www.calpak-usa.com) is an engineering and manufacturing company that did excellent work on circuit board assembly for our prototypes.  Scicon Technologies (www.scicontech.com) is a rapid prototype and manufacturing company that was able to do the high precision and high quality 3D printing that was required for the prototype enclosure parts. Feel free to email us directly at hello@sundaelectronics.com or leave us a message if you have any questions or comments. We'd love to hear from you! Our website is http://www.sundaelectronics.comFollow us!                             Interested in writing about us and our mission? Download our press kit! FAQ1. How do I pre-order SoundBrake 2.0? On Mobile: Click on your desired Perk in the PERKS section. You will then see the pink ""GET THIS PERK"" button appear at the bottom of the Perk box you clicked. Click on this button to get to checkout. On Desktop/Tablet: Click on your desired Perk in the PERKS section on the right side of the campaign page. This will bring you to the checkout page. Please keep in mind during checkout:
You must enter your zip code in the credit card info section, or there will be a checkout error. 
Using auto-fill may cause a checkout error. 
2. How can I use SoundBrake with wireless headphones?You can use SoundBrake with wireless headphones using a standalone wireless transmitter or Bluetooth transmitter module. Instead of plugging wired headphones into SoundBrake's audio jack, plug the wireless transmitter into the audio jack. Then pair your Bluetooth headphones with the transmitter. A Bluetooth transmitter module is included at a higher reward level.3. How is this different than headphones with built-in ambient modes?Headphones that have ""ambient"" or ""transparency"" modes to give you awareness of your surroundings let all outside sound pass through. This impacts your audio quality by removing your isolation and not allowing you to be fully immersed in your music. On the other hand, SoundBrake allows you to be fully isolated while still letting you clearly hear outside sounds louder than the alert level. Furthermore, when you use ambient mode headphones, your music can still distract you from hearing outside sounds, especially at higher volumes. On the other hand,  SoundBrake alerts you by streaming in outside sound while temporarily silencing your audio, so you can be aware of the outside sound and clearly hear it.4. Is this different than using open air headphones?Unlike open air headphones, SoundBrake will not let all outside sound pass through to your headphones. There is no impact to your headphone audio and you will only hear outside sound when it is louder than the alert level.5. Will SoundBrake allow me to use my headphone's built-in controls?Yes! SoundBrake has a four conductor audio plug, which allows it to be used with the headphone's built in track/volume controls.6. What is SoundBrake's battery life?The rechargeable battery lasts for 50+ hours on a single charge. Note about International Shipping:  International shipments may be subject to import taxes, customs duties, and fees levied by the destination country. We don't have control over these charges and you will be responsible for fulfilling them. When customs clearance procedures are required, it can cause a delay beyond our delivery estimate.",48.0,7,"4 Campaigns

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">It's more than a headphone, it's an experience </h3>
<p>At Audeze, we create products that break the mold and change the rules.  We strive to create magical experiences for our customers that go beyond just being an ordinary headphone.   We have been at the forefront of the planar revolution, honoring the audiophile and exciting the audio pro.  Movies, television, and video games are all experiencing an era of unprecedented transformation. Additionally, media consumption is undergoing extraordinary changes.  </p>
<p>We wanted to create a headphone that could enhance this new frontier and provide an immersive cinematic experience that echoes the scope and grandeur the gaming and media world has become.  Mobius is our take on the ultimate gaming and media headphone.  </p>
<p>Mobius is more than a headphone, it is an experience, an opportunity to dynamically interlace your gaming audio in a 3D environment around yourself: to truly live and exist within your media.  Whether it’s a plane flying overhead or the rustling of brush from an enemy behind, the Mobius breathes life into every experience, taking the game from the screen to an entire room.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;color:#d88a29;"">ACCURATE SOUND LOCALIZATION</h3>
<p>Mobius creates a compelling surround sound experience with accurate 3D sound localization. Sound localization is a listener's ability to identify the location or origin of a detected sound, both in direction and by distance. The brain uses a variety of cues to precisely do so, the primary of these being the difference of timing and intensity of a sound as it reaches each ear.  These differences enable the brain to accurately locate sounds.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;color:#d88a29;"">CUSTOMIZABLE ROOM EMULATION</h3>
<p>The sound we hear comes directly from the source and also from multiple reflections of the sound on room walls and other objects. The brain uses the difference between the primary source and reflections to determine space. Mobius uses a very sophisticated customizable room model to create a sense of space.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;color:#d88a29;"">INTEGRATED HEAD TRACKING</h3>
<p>Adding head tracking to headphones enhances the experience of immersion in the game. Mobius precisely tracks head movements 1000 times a second and feeds the 3D emulation algorithm with head position information to aid sound localization and ultimately eliminate the cone of confusion: the brain’s inability to place sounds directly in front or behind without head movement.</p>

<p><strong>Our story begins in 2008</strong> at a small garage in the suburbs of Orange County, California with a vision and commitment to develop headphones that deliver the highest sound quality possible. We produced our first headphones in that garage. We also found our name there. Hanging on the wall was a movie poster for the classic <i><strong>2001: A Space Odyssey</strong></i>. Wanting our company to deliver a “journey through audio,” the name Audeze (pronounced “odyssey”) was a perfect fit.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>We have grown since our beginning and are now internationally recognized for our leading-edge technology and innovation. To this date, our headphones continue to be designed and engineered in our <strong>Southern California facility</strong>.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Audeze’s headphones connect you to your music in its purest form</strong>.  Many other brands of headphones add colorations to the sound, like pumped-up bass, a peaky midrange, or grating high frequencies.  That's not Audeze.  Building upon the many strengths of planar magnetic technology, Audeze has significantly advanced the art of transducer design and delivers the most exciting and engaging audio experience.  </p>

You’ve heard these songs in a million different places on a million different systems.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;color:#d88a29;"">FAQs</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong style=""color: #00a2e3;"">How is Mobius different from other headphones?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Mobius’ leading-edge technologies listed below work together to create realistic 3D audio and to produce an immersive cinematic experience.</p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Audeze's planar magnetic drivers optimized for spatial audio</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Advanced 3D sound emulation algorithm that uses 6-axis (quaternion) tracking with 3-axial accelerometer and 3-axial gyroscope for continuous, intelligent head-tracking</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Anatomically calibrated sound-field personalized based on head geometry</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Psychoacoustically motivated customization of sound-field size</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Support for surround sound modes</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The plug and play options with USB-C, Analog (3.5 mm) and Bluetooth with AAC / LDAC support allows you to get the Mobius high fidelity sound experience wherever you go, whenever you need it.   Mobius delivers a realistic 3D sound experience, in a manner consistent with real-world listening.  This means that you will hear your gaming opponent sneaking up behind you as clearly as though they were in the room with you!</p>
<p><strong style=""color: #00a2e3;"">I’ve been burned in the past with Kickstarter and Indiegogo projects that either were very, very late, or never even shipped. What is my risk with the Mobius?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Your risk is minimal because Mobius is beyond the research and development stage – Mobius is in the production stage!  Furthermore, Audeze is experienced as a company producing boundary-pushing technologies that have been tried, true, and awarded.   Currently, we are conducting safety, compliance, and other certifications.  Based on testing results, possible modifications might be required to pass said tests.  Firmware changes are relatively easy, but physical changes to Mobius might result in a small delay. Additionally, while we fully expect to start customer shipments in June, we could experience some delays in ramping up production if demand is exceedingly higher than expected based on long chipset lead times.  Regardless, Mobius is on the way and soon you can experience it too!</p>
<p><strong style=""color: #00a2e3;"">Is this Vaporware?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Most definitely not. Mobius has been tested and is undergoing final certifications as we speak.  This means we’re fully prepared to ship starting in June!  We’re ready to deliver and that time is nearly upon us.  Additionally, we expect the number of testimonials from people who have experienced Mobius to grow as the campaign continues. </p>
<p><strong style=""color: #00a2e3;"">Why is Audeze launching Mobius on Indiegogo?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Making hardware is tough.  Even though the tooling and product development is complete, estimating demand is difficult for small and large companies alike.  This is an entirely new market for us and we need exposure beyond our traditional customer base. Indiegogo has proven its effectiveness in reaching the technophile and gaming sphere.   Putting this project on Indiegogo for this thirty-day introduction gives us a chance to reach out to as many new customers as possible.  It also allows us to better estimate how much we have to plan and order for initial production.</p>
<p><strong style=""color: #00a2e3;"">Do I need any special software for this to work?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">No, this is not an encode/decode system. Mobius is designed specifically to provide you with the ease of a plug and play setup.  There is a software application for Windows that can be used to customize the headphone audio for those that so choose.  This will work without any need for external software.  However, the special Mobius Creator edition will require the plugins for VR and AR content creation. These will work with Windows, Macintosh, Linux, and Android (with correct USB audio drivers in use).</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We will release an application for Windows that will allow firmware updates, customization based on head geometry, and room size.  App support for other platforms will depend on demand. </p>
<p><strong style=""color: #00a2e3;"">Will Mobius work with my Xbox/Playstation/Switch?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Mobius will work with Xbox/PS4/Switch using only the analog cable (or Bluetooth if applicable).  USB audio will not work with these devices.  However, the headtracking, room emulation, and spatialization also work in analog and Bluetooth modes.  So, even though you don't get USB audio, the analog connection with 3D audio is very compelling.</p>
<p><strong style=""color: #00a2e3;"">Can I turn off the 3D features?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Yes.  The 3D features can be turned off if you choose and Mobius can be used as standard Audeze planar headphones.</p>
<p><strong style=""color: #00a2e3;"">Is the boom microphone included?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Yes.  It uses a standard 3.5mm TRRS plug/jack.  You can easily remove it at any time, but please note it is “keyed” and should be inserted correctly.</p>
<p><strong style=""color: #00a2e3;"">How long is the battery life, and how long does it take to fully charge?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Battery life is around 10+ hours with 3D audio enabled.  With USB usage, the battery will be charged when plugged in.  Charge time with a 1.0 Amp charger and Mobius turned off is about 3 hours from 0% to 100%.</p>
<p><strong style=""color: #00a2e3;"">If the battery runs out and I’m using the analog cable, will Mobius continue to work?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">No, due to all the features we’ve included, Mobius must either run on battery power or be plugged into a USB port.</p>
<p><strong style=""color: #00a2e3;"">What is the material on the ear pads and headband? Are the ear pads replaceable?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The ear pads and headband use memory foam covered in artificial leather.  The ear pads are contoured to provide both a good seal and comfort and are user replaceable. </p>
<p><strong style=""color: #00a2e3;"">Can I use Mobius for things other than gaming?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Absolutely.  You can use Mobius for listening to music, watching movies in 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound, mixing or mastering audio (especially multichannel audio), creating content for VR/AR applications, or to simply wear around your neck.  In fact, they work great for teleconferencing (SKYPE, Discord, TeamSpeak calls!) and even FaceTime on iPhones.  Mobius is tuned to have frequency response like our LCD series of professional headphones and is equally great if used beyond gaming.</p>
<p><strong style=""color: #00a2e3;"">Will this work over USB-C on my Android phone?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We have tested Mobius with the following phones: Google Pixel phones, Sony USB-C models, Razer, and Samsung Galaxy s9.  We cannot guarantee compatibility with every USB-C mobile phone since the Android USB Audio implementation varies between manufacturers.  It will also work using the camera adapter on iDevices.</p>
<p><strong style=""color: #00a2e3;"">Will this work with my iPhone?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Mobius will work with iDevices using the Lightning-to-USB camera adapter.  There is no native Lightning connectivity.</p>
<p><strong style=""color: #00a2e3;"">My cell phone only has a micro USB port. How do I get it to work with the USB C of the Mobius?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">A micro USB to C adapter (not included) should work for that purpose.</p>
<p><strong style=""color: #00a2e3;"">Which Bluetooth profiles are supported?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">SBC, AAC and LDAC are supported.  LDAC support is still in compliance testing.</p>
<p><strong style=""color: #00a2e3;"">Does Mobius support fast charging or wireless charging?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">No.</p>
<p><strong style=""color: #00a2e3;"">What about support for Dolby Atmos, Ambisonics, MPEG-H, etc.?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">To bring Mobius to you as soon as possible, we’ve worked hard managing the fine balance between the features we can deliver in a timely manner, content availability, and what is truly capable within chipsets that are available today.  We firmly believe Mobius offers an unbeatable combination of price for its incredible feature set.  Some features not currently included today are on our road map for the future.  At this time, we have chosen to support Ambisonics through plugins.</p>
<p><strong style=""color: #00a2e3;"">What is the warranty for Mobius?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We offer a one-year warranty unless otherwise mandated by local laws.</p>
<p><strong style=""color: #00a2e3;"">What is the battery warranty?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Battery warranty is one year from the date we ship your Mobius.</p>
<p><strong style=""color: #00a2e3;"">Will the Mobius be hand-built in Southern California like the rest of Audeze’s headphones?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The Mobius is designed and engineered in our California facility. The planar transducers and their special thin films will also be manufactured here. Other parts will be sourced from different countries including Taiwan, China, and Japan. However, due to the large quantities needed to satisfy worldwide demand, the final assembly of Mobius will be in China with our own quality control department in charge of production.</p>
<p><strong style=""color: #00a2e3;"">How much is the shipping?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We offer free shipping within the USA.  The International shipping cost will vary by country as detailed below. Additionally, <strong>you will be responsible for any additional taxes, duties, or VAT</strong> <strong>for any product shipped outside the USA</strong>. </p>
<ul style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<li>Canada: $20</li>
<li>Europe: $30</li>
<li>Australia and New Zealand: $60</li>
<li>The rest of world:  $40</li>
</ul>
<p><strong style=""color: #00a2e3;"">Why should I order now?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">During this Indiegogo campaign, we are offering incredible value and remarkable discounts for our early adopters.  Early backers will receive the deepest discounts. Actual ship dates will vary depending on your country and when you’ve placed your order. We will keep you up to date on every step of the process. </p>
<p><strong style=""color: #00a2e3;"">Where can I buy Mobius after the Indiegogo campaign ends?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">After our campaign ends, Mobius will be available directly from Audeze.com, the Audeze Amazon page, and a few select retailers in the USA (like Micro Center).  Mobius will also be available to virtually all countries via our international distributors.  However, due to different certifications required by each country, some countries may have delayed availability.</p>
<p><strong style=""color: #00a2e3;"">I can’t wait to experience Mobius.  Is there anywhere that I can listen to the Mobius?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Yes. We will be giving demos at our facility in Santa Ana, California. You can also demo Mobius at various trade shows including CanJam in LA and London, VRLA in Los Angeles, AXPONA in Chicago, among others.  We also have plans to host various gaming events in the future (details to come).</p>

Introducing Audeze Mobius:
It's more than a headphone, it's an experience 
At Audeze, we create products that break the mold and change the rules.  We strive to create magical experiences for our customers that go beyond just being an ordinary headphone.   We have been at the forefront of the planar revolution, honoring the audiophile and exciting the audio pro.  Movies, television, and video games are all experiencing an era of unprecedented transformation. Additionally, media consumption is undergoing extraordinary changes.  
We wanted to create a headphone that could enhance this new frontier and provide an immersive cinematic experience that echoes the scope and grandeur the gaming and media world has become.  Mobius is our take on the ultimate gaming and media headphone.  
Mobius is more than a headphone, it is an experience, an opportunity to dynamically interlace your gaming audio in a 3D environment around yourself: to truly live and exist within your media.  Whether it’s a plane flying overhead or the rustling of brush from an enemy behind, the Mobius breathes life into every experience, taking the game from the screen to an entire room.

 
Mobius is a Critical Hit!

Don’t just take our word for it, hear what others have shared about the incredible Mobius experience:
 


A good analogy would be comparing Mobius to an audio equivalent of what VR headsets do for the visual component of games. We played some Assassin’s Creed Origins and listened to some music and both instances sounded as if I was in the middle of whatever scenario was going on, whether it was a jazz combo playing or some angry man with a sword trying to kill me.”
 


The soundstage of the Mobius headphones exhibited was immensely wide, which is by design, but — and this is the thing that will especially appeal to gamers — it was the precise positioning of each rebound that was most impressive.""
 

 

With extremely advanced and integrated head tracking to create an uncanny sense of surround realism, the Audeze Mobius is something far greater than just a gaming headset. The Mobius is a highly sophisticated mixed media platform, and it's amazing.""
 


Instead of relying on flashing lights and other gaudy gimmicks, Audeze is entering the headphone space with meaningful innovation. Building on the foundation of its planar magnetic drivers, the company has created a headset that can deliver 3D audio and sound localization that enhance video games as well as music, videos and phone calls.""
 
 

 


 


Until you've tried Mobius, it's tough to translate what a genuinely remarkable experience it is and the differences it will make in your gaming reality. Just check out these responses to our phenomenal headphones from early product testing.""

​
 
 
 

What's inside MOBIUS?
Mobius creates immersive cinematic 3D audio using a rich assortment of technologies and features.  At the foundation of Mobius’ great sound is our cutting edge planar magnetic technology that creates an accurate, distortion free, immersive sound, one that produces a real-world listening experience.  With materials originally designed for NASA, Audeze’s drivers are the most powerful and effective transducers in the world and make the Mobius sound just as incredible.  You won’t find this driver technology in any other gaming headphone!

 
 
 
 
The most technologically advanced headphone 
Mobius’ leading-edge technologies work together to take you from inside your headphone and out of your head into your content. You need all of these technologies to create realistic 3D audio and to produce immersive cinematic experience.
 

•  Full 3D emulation with support for popular surround soundmodes (7.1, 5.1, 5.0, 2.1, 2.0)•  Integrated head tracking that tracks the tiniest movements of your head 1000 times a second•  Pin point sound localization•  Anatomy calibration to tailor the sound to the user•  Full room emulation•   Mobius integrates Waves Nx technology for real-time 3D processing in hardware
 
 
 

 
ACCURATE SOUND LOCALIZATION
Mobius creates a compelling surround sound experience with accurate 3D sound localization. Sound localization is a listener's ability to identify the location or origin of a detected sound, both in direction and by distance. The brain uses a variety of cues to precisely do so, the primary of these being the difference of timing and intensity of a sound as it reaches each ear.  These differences enable the brain to accurately locate sounds.
 

 

 
CUSTOMIZABLE ROOM EMULATION
The sound we hear comes directly from the source and also from multiple reflections of the sound on room walls and other objects. The brain uses the difference between the primary source and reflections to determine space. Mobius uses a very sophisticated customizable room model to create a sense of space.
 

 

 
INTEGRATED HEAD TRACKING
Adding head tracking to headphones enhances the experience of immersion in the game. Mobius precisely tracks head movements 1000 times a second and feeds the 3D emulation algorithm with head position information to aid sound localization and ultimately eliminate the cone of confusion: the brain’s inability to place sounds directly in front or behind without head movement.

THE MOST CRITICALLY ACCLAIMED HEADPHONE BRAND IN THE WORLD
– Audeze Ranked #1 Best Reviewed Headphone Brand –
PickyEar.com recently analyzed 310,067 headphone reviews to answer this question: What is the best headphone brand?  They looked at expert reviews. They looked at reputable forum reviews. They even looked at regular-user reviews. They collected and analyzed this data to see which of 32 brands consistently produce quality headphones, and ranked them based on this.  And what did they find:  The #1  top-ranked headphone brand is Audeze!
“Audeze is the only real champion to the throne of headphones. There's no compromise with Audeze, and if you favor the bass end of the spectrum, you have probably been dreaming about some Audeze headphones for a while now. Each Audeze headphone has its own characteristics, but they offer the same level of quality across their range of products.”

A JOURNEY INTO AUDIO
Our story begins in 2008 at a small garage in the suburbs of Orange County, California with a vision and commitment to develop headphones that deliver the highest sound quality possible. We produced our first headphones in that garage. We also found our name there. Hanging on the wall was a movie poster for the classic 2001: A Space Odyssey. Wanting our company to deliver a “journey through audio,” the name Audeze (pronounced “odyssey”) was a perfect fit.
 

 
We have grown since our beginning and are now internationally recognized for our leading-edge technology and innovation. To this date, our headphones continue to be designed and engineered in our Southern California facility.

 
Audeze’s headphones connect you to your music in its purest form.  Many other brands of headphones add colorations to the sound, like pumped-up bass, a peaky midrange, or grating high frequencies.  That's not Audeze.  Building upon the many strengths of planar magnetic technology, Audeze has significantly advanced the art of transducer design and delivers the most exciting and engaging audio experience.  
""If you’re passionate about music like we are, you’ll have songs and albums you have listened to for your whole life. You’ve heard these songs in a million different places on a million different systems. We are confident that the first time you listen to an Audeze headphone, you will discover details in the music you may have never heard before.""
 – Sankar Thiagasamudram, CEO Audeze
 
 
 

 
CUTTING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY
Every Audeze headphone employs cutting-edge planar magnetic technology for more accurate, high-quality audiophile sound. Our headphones use proprietary, custom-cast magnets placed on one or both sides of the diaphragm to create a powerful magnetic field. The result is our high-end planar magnetic technology connects you to your favorite artists and musicians as if you were right there at the original event.
 
 

 
BUILT FOR PERFORMANCE
Audeze designs every headphone with quality first and foremost in mind. Our headphones are put through exacting inspections and thoroughly tested before leaving our facility for world-wide distribution. Audeze’s advanced manufacturing process combined with the latest materials and technology produces extremely accurate and incredible sounding headphones.
 
 
 
UNCOMPROMISED AUDIO
Since we produced our first headphone in 2008, our headphones have earned multiple awards, rave reviews and are the top choice of artists and audiophiles worldwide.

FAQs
 
How is Mobius different from other headphones?
Mobius’ leading-edge technologies listed below work together to create realistic 3D audio and to produce an immersive cinematic experience.

Audeze's planar magnetic drivers optimized for spatial audio
Advanced 3D sound emulation algorithm that uses 6-axis (quaternion) tracking with 3-axial accelerometer and 3-axial gyroscope for continuous, intelligent head-tracking
Anatomically calibrated sound-field personalized based on head geometry
Psychoacoustically motivated customization of sound-field size
Support for surround sound modes

The plug and play options with USB-C, Analog (3.5 mm) and Bluetooth with AAC / LDAC support allows you to get the Mobius high fidelity sound experience wherever you go, whenever you need it.   Mobius delivers a realistic 3D sound experience, in a manner consistent with real-world listening.  This means that you will hear your gaming opponent sneaking up behind you as clearly as though they were in the room with you!
I’ve been burned in the past with Kickstarter and Indiegogo projects that either were very, very late, or never even shipped. What is my risk with the Mobius?
Your risk is minimal because Mobius is beyond the research and development stage – Mobius is in the production stage!  Furthermore, Audeze is experienced as a company producing boundary-pushing technologies that have been tried, true, and awarded.   Currently, we are conducting safety, compliance, and other certifications.  Based on testing results, possible modifications might be required to pass said tests.  Firmware changes are relatively easy, but physical changes to Mobius might result in a small delay. Additionally, while we fully expect to start customer shipments in June, we could experience some delays in ramping up production if demand is exceedingly higher than expected based on long chipset lead times.  Regardless, Mobius is on the way and soon you can experience it too!
Is this Vaporware?
Most definitely not. Mobius has been tested and is undergoing final certifications as we speak.  This means we’re fully prepared to ship starting in June!  We’re ready to deliver and that time is nearly upon us.  Additionally, we expect the number of testimonials from people who have experienced Mobius to grow as the campaign continues. 
Why is Audeze launching Mobius on Indiegogo?
Making hardware is tough.  Even though the tooling and product development is complete, estimating demand is difficult for small and large companies alike.  This is an entirely new market for us and we need exposure beyond our traditional customer base. Indiegogo has proven its effectiveness in reaching the technophile and gaming sphere.   Putting this project on Indiegogo for this thirty-day introduction gives us a chance to reach out to as many new customers as possible.  It also allows us to better estimate how much we have to plan and order for initial production.
Do I need any special software for this to work?
No, this is not an encode/decode system. Mobius is designed specifically to provide you with the ease of a plug and play setup.  There is a software application for Windows that can be used to customize the headphone audio for those that so choose.  This will work without any need for external software.  However, the special Mobius Creator edition will require the plugins for VR and AR content creation. These will work with Windows, Macintosh, Linux, and Android (with correct USB audio drivers in use).
We will release an application for Windows that will allow firmware updates, customization based on head geometry, and room size.  App support for other platforms will depend on demand. 
Will Mobius work with my Xbox/Playstation/Switch?
Mobius will work with Xbox/PS4/Switch using only the analog cable (or Bluetooth if applicable).  USB audio will not work with these devices.  However, the headtracking, room emulation, and spatialization also work in analog and Bluetooth modes.  So, even though you don't get USB audio, the analog connection with 3D audio is very compelling.
Can I turn off the 3D features?
Yes.  The 3D features can be turned off if you choose and Mobius can be used as standard Audeze planar headphones.
Is the boom microphone included?
Yes.  It uses a standard 3.5mm TRRS plug/jack.  You can easily remove it at any time, but please note it is “keyed” and should be inserted correctly.
How long is the battery life, and how long does it take to fully charge?
Battery life is around 10+ hours with 3D audio enabled.  With USB usage, the battery will be charged when plugged in.  Charge time with a 1.0 Amp charger and Mobius turned off is about 3 hours from 0% to 100%.
If the battery runs out and I’m using the analog cable, will Mobius continue to work?
No, due to all the features we’ve included, Mobius must either run on battery power or be plugged into a USB port.
What is the material on the ear pads and headband? Are the ear pads replaceable?
The ear pads and headband use memory foam covered in artificial leather.  The ear pads are contoured to provide both a good seal and comfort and are user replaceable. 
Can I use Mobius for things other than gaming?
Absolutely.  You can use Mobius for listening to music, watching movies in 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound, mixing or mastering audio (especially multichannel audio), creating content for VR/AR applications, or to simply wear around your neck.  In fact, they work great for teleconferencing (SKYPE, Discord, TeamSpeak calls!) and even FaceTime on iPhones.  Mobius is tuned to have frequency response like our LCD series of professional headphones and is equally great if used beyond gaming.
Will this work over USB-C on my Android phone?
We have tested Mobius with the following phones: Google Pixel phones, Sony USB-C models, Razer, and Samsung Galaxy s9.  We cannot guarantee compatibility with every USB-C mobile phone since the Android USB Audio implementation varies between manufacturers.  It will also work using the camera adapter on iDevices.
Will this work with my iPhone?
Mobius will work with iDevices using the Lightning-to-USB camera adapter.  There is no native Lightning connectivity.
My cell phone only has a micro USB port. How do I get it to work with the USB C of the Mobius?
A micro USB to C adapter (not included) should work for that purpose.
Which Bluetooth profiles are supported?
SBC, AAC and LDAC are supported.  LDAC support is still in compliance testing.
Does Mobius support fast charging or wireless charging?
No.
What about support for Dolby Atmos, Ambisonics, MPEG-H, etc.?
To bring Mobius to you as soon as possible, we’ve worked hard managing the fine balance between the features we can deliver in a timely manner, content availability, and what is truly capable within chipsets that are available today.  We firmly believe Mobius offers an unbeatable combination of price for its incredible feature set.  Some features not currently included today are on our road map for the future.  At this time, we have chosen to support Ambisonics through plugins.
What is the warranty for Mobius?
We offer a one-year warranty unless otherwise mandated by local laws.
What is the battery warranty?
Battery warranty is one year from the date we ship your Mobius.
Will the Mobius be hand-built in Southern California like the rest of Audeze’s headphones?
The Mobius is designed and engineered in our California facility. The planar transducers and their special thin films will also be manufactured here. Other parts will be sourced from different countries including Taiwan, China, and Japan. However, due to the large quantities needed to satisfy worldwide demand, the final assembly of Mobius will be in China with our own quality control department in charge of production.
How much is the shipping?
We offer free shipping within the USA.  The International shipping cost will vary by country as detailed below. Additionally, you will be responsible for any additional taxes, duties, or VAT for any product shipped outside the USA. 

Canada: $20
Europe: $30
Australia and New Zealand: $60
The rest of world:  $40

Why should I order now?
During this Indiegogo campaign, we are offering incredible value and remarkable discounts for our early adopters.  Early backers will receive the deepest discounts. Actual ship dates will vary depending on your country and when you’ve placed your order. We will keep you up to date on every step of the process. 
Where can I buy Mobius after the Indiegogo campaign ends?
After our campaign ends, Mobius will be available directly from Audeze.com, the Audeze Amazon page, and a few select retailers in the USA (like Micro Center).  Mobius will also be available to virtually all countries via our international distributors.  However, due to different certifications required by each country, some countries may have delayed availability.
I can’t wait to experience Mobius.  Is there anywhere that I can listen to the Mobius?
Yes. We will be giving demos at our facility in Santa Ana, California. You can also demo Mobius at various trade shows including CanJam in LA and London, VRLA in Los Angeles, AXPONA in Chicago, among others.  We also have plans to host various gaming events in the future (details to come).",40.0,3,"1 Campaign

<p>'Actual Outputs'</p>
<p>We will explain what those are. These are called PP(Pre-Production) product. Basically, they are the outcomes right before the actual mass production. Every manufacturing company has to go through the PP process before they actually start any mass production if they care about the quality. </p></figure></div><p>The PP product is made for the experimental production phase. It is produced to find out problems that we did not expect from our designing stage with the modeling data that we shared last time. Sometimes what we see from the computer screen is different once it comes out to the real life. If we find out any issue from the PP product, we indicate the problems to the manufacturer and they compensate the defects. Also, by assembling the product, we can check out the details of each component. Most importantly, every component has a design intended function and we must double check whether it works well or not by assembling them. In our case, we are producing 1,000 PP product and some of them are already compensated it's defect.</p><p><strong>2. Lens Frame</strong></p><p>We would like to show a hidden wire.

Current Status (As of Feb 1st)
We will show you the actual images of every single part of our product up to date.
1. Exploded View v. Actual Outputs

'Exploded View'

'Actual Outputs'
We will explain what those are. These are called PP(Pre-Production) product. Basically, they are the outcomes right before the actual mass production. Every manufacturing company has to go through the PP process before they actually start any mass production if they care about the quality. The PP product is made for the experimental production phase. It is produced to find out problems that we did not expect from our designing stage with the modeling data that we shared last time. Sometimes what we see from the computer screen is different once it comes out to the real life. If we find out any issue from the PP product, we indicate the problems to the manufacturer and they compensate the defects. Also, by assembling the product, we can check out the details of each component. Most importantly, every component has a design intended function and we must double check whether it works well or not by assembling them. In our case, we are producing 1,000 PP product and some of them are already compensated it's defect.2. Lens FrameWe would like to show a hidden wire. The wire is installed inside of the frame. The wire connects the battery to the PCV module. Thus, we cut the lens frame in half to show you the wire that we put inside. The frame is holing the wire so tight that it will not be moving around the frame. 3. Right LegThe right leg has a touch pad, a PCV module, a power button and etc. As you see from the images below, some of you may ask us why the right leg has more components than the other side. It is because to keep the balance equal to the left leg. Also because there are more right handed people in the world, the control pad is on the right side.4. Left LegThis is where the battery goes inside. The battery is one of the heaviest components of Zungle Panther.(BUT, it is still light :)) As it is mentioned above, keeping the balance is one of our goals and it worked well. Check out the images below.5. SpeakersThe speakers, the most important part of Zungle Panther, are located at the end of each leg. The silver round shaped ones are the speakers. Then, a couple of silicon components and plastic components are surrounding the speakers. The surroundings prevent delivering the vibration from the speakers to the lens frame. Then, you will only be able to feel the vibration from the speakers. 6. Complete ProductWe all know you have been waiting for this. We won't talk much. Let's see it.",39.0,7,"2 Campaigns

Duo Speakers™ Utilize Advanced Bluetooth Technology to Connect Two Wireless Speakers, to the Same Device, resulting in True Stereo Sound. 


Backers of our Rebel and Mighty Speaker Campaigns have been asking for the ability to pair two speakers to one device so they can enjoy stereo sound and listen to the same song in two adjoining rooms...we listened.
""Finally, a wireless Bluetooth speaker that can be split in two and placed in separate locations, providing true stereo sound and room-to-room streaming music."" ~ Mike D. 






Product Details:
Duo Speakers™ consist of two Wireless Bluetooth Speakers that come packaged as one unit which can then be split into two separate speakers, both sharing the same Bluetooth connection.

The two speakers are located on opposite ends of the combined unit and held together by a magnetic connection in the middle.



You can enjoy standard stereo sound that other two-speaker bluetooth ""pills, tubes and boxes"" provide by using the Duo Speakers™ connected end to end as one unit facing apart or angled forward, or you can split the two speakers up and position them as close or far away from each other as you would like, to enjoy True Stereo Sound. 








Want to enjoy the same music in two adjoining rooms or areas?
Duo Speakers™ can be placed up to 32 feet apart (distance varies based on density of obstructions) allowing for both speakers to be located in different rooms while sharing the same Bluetooth connection and playing the same track.

Muse Auto is featured at the Target Open House in San Francisco. If you are in the area, come experience it first-hand!

THE POWER OF ALEXA - IN YOUR CAR
What would you do if you had an intelligent and highly versatile assistant in your car? Unlike your phone's native assistant, Alexa does not ask you to unlock your phone. It has over 25,000 skills that work with just your voice.


NO SUBSCRIPTION REQUIRED
Muse Auto offers the best hands and eyes-free audio entertainment in the car without requiring a paid music subscription. Voice control music from your favorite artists, popular radio stations, millions of podcasts with free services like iHeartRadio and TuneIn.

Muse Auto uses your iPhone or Android phone's standard data plan, and it works with a free Amazon account. Want on-demand music? Amazon Music ($7.99) and Prime Music (free for Prime members) are already supported. Spotify and Pandora support is planned as a free update.
HANDS-FREE CALLING
Safety in the car is of paramount importance to us. That's why we've included hands-free calling in Muse Auto. Hear the caller from your car stereo and speak with confidence with our best-in-class noise-canceling microphone.

EVERYTHING IS INCLUDED
The box includes everything you need to get set up in most cars. It includes the Muse Auto device and the magnetic mount. We've also included a dual USB car charger so you can power Muse Auto and charge your phone! All you need is an Android or iOS phone with cellular data plan, and of course, a car.

SUPER EASY INSTALLATION
Muse Auto fits nicely into any car and takes less than 3 minutes to set up. It comes with a 6.5-foot long cable and removable magnetic mount that gives you the flexibility to place it on the dash, in the center console, or wherever you like. 


 

PRIVACY WHEN YOU NEED IT
Muse Auto features hardware-level mute so that you can turn off any and all audio going into Muse Auto. Just hold and release the Microphone button to turn on mute and neither Muse Auto nor Alexa will hear anything.

 
MUSE AUTO PRODUCT DESIGN
Inside the modest case is a highly-capable car accessory that is packed with innovative features and unparalleled smarts.  

Muse Auto runs on a powerful Qualcomm processor that is loaded with our innovative voice recognition, noise cancellation, hands-free calling and Bluetooth technology. It seamlessly integrates with the Muse Auto app on your smartphone for setup, connectivity, and visuals feedback.

At that time, those devices were either very pricey or lacking in quality. In order to produce a superior, and affordable pocket HiFi audio device, a group of technicians with experience in HiFi audio R&amp;D teamed up to create the Hidizs brand. In early 2010, the Hidizs team started researching the global HiFi audio market; in Oct 2012, the Hidizs R&amp;D team became official. In Jan 2014, Hidizs’ first pocket HiFi audio player AP100 was officially launch at CES, Las Vegas. After fine-tuning our designs, the AP200 was born.</p><div data-id=""17894555""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1502734570/grvz9k8yicp8dnt2fa3s.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p></div>","Pусский | 日本語Why we've built the AP200:Audio that comes from portable devices tend to not sound great. At Hidizs, we’re trying to change this by designing our own portable music player that enhances the music listening experience. We believe that no one should ever compromise on sound quality.After spending two years on more than 50 design sketches, 10 prototypes, we present to you:The AP200’s Hi-Res Audio certification was issued by JAS (Japan Audio Association) and CEA (Consumer Technology Association), showing our commitment to crafting a high quality sound equipment.AP200's mission is to provide the best possible listening experience of your favorite digital music.This tiny device allows you to unleash high fidelity sound from every music device.Comparison Chart  From the very beginning, the HIDIZS AP200 was designed to be a totally breakthrough product in numerous aspects. First and foremost is the one-piece CNC’d stainless-steel/aluminium-alloy structure.Once the solid stainless-steel/aluminium-alloy blocks have been selected they are clamped to the machining brackets. The high precision CNC milling machine then bevels the four sides in accordance with our customized computer design. The main chassis alone takes 120 minutes to cut into shape.The AP200 brings a unique physical and aesthetic experience. We designed the AP200 with symmetrical buttons so you can operate AP200 without looking to the device. This makes the AP200 is an easy-to-operate, smart Hi-Fi music player. Single click the up & down buttons for volume adjustment, double click the up & down buttons to skip to the next/previous song.The AP200 utilizes USB Type-C, the most up-to-date USB connection type, for faster data transfer and charging speeds. It also offers one micro SD card slot, supporting up to 256GB.

Hidizs AP200 features a 3.54-inch (960x640, 325 PPI) touch screen, a perfect portable size for using the AP200. With a 2.28x0.62x4.17 inch product dimension, Hidizs AP200 is perfect for one hand operation.

 

 
Hidizs AP200 lasts 10 hours on a single charge. Enjoy uninterrupted music for as long as you need. Coupled with Japanese precision protection circuit, this makes the 3100mAh lithium battery extra safe and reliable.

 

The AP200 is the first high resolution music player to utilize individual flagship ESS ES9118C DAC chips for each channel (Left/Right). Perfect channel separation is achieved as the sound field reaches an unprecedented broad width, both in the vertical and horizontal planes.

Vocal and instrument reproduction is exceptionally accurate, which allows the AP200 to effortlessly playback a wide range of music genres, from pop to orchestral symphonies. Enjoy music as though you are in the middle of a concert, right in front of your favorite singer, band or orchestra.

 

To further improve the sound quality of the AP200, HIDIZS specifically custom-made a 24K gold-plated shield for each ES9118C DAC chip. This means that each DAC chip operates within a fully shielded environment, eliminating interference from surrounding signals, which gives a cleaner music sound without any noise and signal interference. 


The AP200 utilizes two separate crystal oscillators - one for DSD/44.1/88.2/176.4/352.8 kHz sampling-rates, and the other for 48/96/192/384 kHz sampling-rates. This results in significantly reduced jitter, improved clock accuracy, and more stable operation, which equates to a faithful reproduction of the original sound. Experience sound like never before.

 

Other hardware specs and features include a 3.54-inch (960x640, 325 PPI) touch display, 1GB of internal RAM, 32GB/64GB/128GB internal storage and expandable up to 256GB with external Micro SD card slot. Additionally, the AP200 utilizes Rockchip’s 28nm RK3188 SoC, which contains 4 Cortex-A9 cores, resulting in an increase of 35% processing speed as compared to the previous generations.It also features Android™ OS 5.1 with Google Play™.

 

The AP200 supports most Hi-Res lossless formats, including FLAC, APE, WMA, WAV, ALAC, Apple LOSSLESS, DSF, and DSDIFF. Native support for DSD 64/128, PCM up to 384Khz/32bit, ISO DSD format

 

The AP200 supports two-way transmission for both Bluetooth 4.0 and the apt-X lossless transmission protocol. This versatility means that the AP200 has the capability to both transmit, as well as receive audio signals over Bluetooth. When connected to a Bluetooth equipped smartphone or computer, the AP200 will decode the signal via its dual DAC chips. Enjoy your wireless music experience like never before.

The AP200 can also be used as a high-quality music source by connecting it to headphones/IEMs via a wired connection or over Bluetooth, as well as an in-vehicle device when connected to a Bluetooth-equipped vehicle audio system. (Please note that your headphones or other Bluetooth devices must support the apt-X protocol in order to take advantage of the AP200’s apt-X lossless transmission)

The AP200 utilizes an IEEE 802.11 b/g/n 2.4GHz WiFi module. This allows users to listen to their favourite online streaming services, or install any online 3rd-party music app, such as streaming through Spotify, Tidal, Pandora, or any other music streaming app, allowing for an immediately upgraded sound experience. With the HIDIZS AP200 you can enjoy your HiFi music anytime, anywhere. Break the bondage of conventional wired connections, and become immersed in wireless music heaven.

Comparative Measurements 

To understand the sound quality difference between AP200 and smartphone, it is useful to compare the objective performance between APP200 and the iPhone 6 directly. We used professional equipment Audio Precision APX515 to measure all of the acoustic data below.

Channel Separation
For the audio system, lower crosstalk brings better stereo image and channel separation. Hidizs AP200 has lower channel separation date than the iPhone 6 which means it can provide clearer sound that’s more crisp. 
Frequency Response
The AP200 can reach the Hi-Res standard 40kHz, while the iPhone 6 can only reach the 20kHz, this means AP200 contains much more detail of the original track.

SRN
The signal-to-noise ratio is defined as the ratio of the power of a signal (meaningful information) and the power of background noise (unwanted signal). The AP200 has a higher SRN than the iPhone 6, which means that AP200 can provide a purer sound. Some high-end supra-aural headphones require the source to have a certain SRN to be able to maximize the headphone’s capabilities.
THD+N Ratio
The THD (Total harmonic distortion) ratio of AP200 is only half of the iPhone 6. In audio systems, lower distortion means the equipment produce a more accurate reproduction of an audio recording.
AP200 Versions 
We have developed two body versions for AP200.

<p>Just like every human face and voice are unique, so too is the structure of everyone’s inner ear. These variations in anatomy result in us hearing sounds differently. There’s a very wide range in our sensitivities to different frequencies - normal hearing range is &gt;20dB at each frequency (that’s about seven clicks on the volume button of a smartphone).</p>
<p>When soundwaves enter your ear canal, they vibrate the eardrum. These vibrations are transferred through a series of small bones to the cochlea - our favorite organ in the body.</p>

<p>Being a lifelong music lover and engineer, Kyle started systematically looking for the perfect pair of headphones and discovered that headphones are like shoes - perfection depends on who’s wearing them. This led to the realization that headphones need to be able to understand the person’s hearing so that they can adapt and match the listener.</p>
<p>Kyle approached Luke to explore whether it would be possible to squeeze a hearing measurement machine into a pair of headphones and make a closed-loop music experience. They found out it could be done and started working on the core technology to make it possible.</p>

Did you know that your hearing is as unique as your fingerprint, your face and your voice? Each of us has different sensitivities to different frequencies of sound. This means the same pair of headphones sound different for each person. And the difference is significant.
How the listening experience can differ between two people
 

How do you choose the right pair of headphones when we all hear differently? Sound and hearing are very hard to objectively self-assess. How do you know what you’re missing? Audiophiles are skilled at the art, but this takes them years of experience. 
Nura empowers everyone who loves music to find their perfect sound - automatically. Nura actually knows which sounds are getting through fully and which sounds are not. It uses this information to fill in your musical black spots.
 








Our backers spoke! We are proud to announce the addition of wireless (Bluetooth) and analog (3.5mm) connectivity!

Our technology combines deep hearing and neuroscience, psychoacoustics, signal processing and acoustics. Nura does not require you to answer a test. You sit there and listen for 30s. That’s it.

The first time you put them on your head, they’ll measure your hearing - a process that takes about 30 seconds.
Nura headphones actually know you. Any time you put them on, Nura will recognize you in less than two seconds.
Once Nura identifies you, they load your profile. Any music you listen to (no matter the app) will be optimized for your hearing, so you can hear every note perfectly.


 



You don’t have to spend countless hours and lots of money to find great audio. It’s not necessary to be a sound expert either (that’s where we come in). Nura is designed for music enthusiasts. So, if you love music, Nura is for you!


Please share your thoughts with us. And if you’re passionate about music, please share our story with the world.
 
 
 
 
 


Music has the power to unite. It has brought together our team of experts in engineering, acoustics, biology, hearing science, and product delivery.

 

Being a lifelong music lover and engineer, Kyle started systematically looking for the perfect pair of headphones and discovered that headphones are like shoes - perfection depends on who’s wearing them. This led to the realization that headphones need to be able to understand the person’s hearing so that they can adapt and match the listener.
Kyle approached Luke to explore whether it would be possible to squeeze a hearing measurement machine into a pair of headphones and make a closed-loop music experience. They found out it could be done and started working on the core technology to make it possible.

 
 We’re passionate about music and enabling people to experience it fully.
 
In January of this year, we were accepted into theHAX Accelerator, which has lower acceptance rate (3%) than Stanford (4.7%) or Harvard (5.2%). We dropped everything, leaving our friends, families, and careers to come to China for four months to work on development and prototyping.

We’re now ready to move ahead with manufacturing and plan to start production at the end of 2016. This includes tooling, sourcing and regulatory certifications. Our product will be ready to ship to our Indiegogo InDemand supporters by May 2017.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>About</strong></p>
<p>Welcome, fans and friends! We are Strip66, the jazz-funk band from New York who needs your help to make a music video for our song <i>Minimal Drizzle</i>! Here's a link to the song on BandCamp: <a href=""https://strip66.bandcamp.com/releases"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://strip66.bandcamp.com/releases</a></p>
<p>The continuous flow of nature represent many facets of love, relationships, careers, and life in general. Our song, Minimal Drizzle, is about how our surroundings and environment can affect our mood and change with the flexibility of our daily lives. But it’s also a spiritual song, with nature symbolizing continuity of life, which is free-flowing and fluid. The song is a positive reflection to sinking beneath water, it’s easy to begin feeling heavier and more weighted, with an overwhelming sense of pressure and force. But if you relax, it can be freeing, you feel beside yourself, and there is a calming knowledge that as long as you keep yourself awake, something bright is waiting for you above the surface when you float back up.</p>
<p>We are choosing to film this video in the wintertime because even though physically, nature is less fluid, it is continuous in terms of its lifetime. The water, trees, and flowers will soon wake up again, like they always do. This song is very important to us because when we play it, we feel the audience connecting with us. We want to make a music video that is personifying of nature, allowing anybody who watches it to interpret it in any way they want.</p>
<p>We need your help to make this project happen, so please donate anything you can. Thank you!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Our Vision for the Video</strong></p>
<p>We hope to produce a video where the band is trapped inside a snow-globe that they break out of. We will be using special effects to do this. The video will be filmed in Madison, NH. We chose to film it in Madison because it has very beautiful spots that we hope to feature in the song. We will also feature shots from a drone. We hope to convey the message that even though things might get hard, you can still find ways to enjoy life. The video is also about letting the stresses of everyday life is and enjoying the environment around you. </p>
<p>Feel free to reach out for a more in-depth description of the music video.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Budget</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>To make this project happen, we will need money for transportation to Madison, NH. We will also need money to get food for everyone involved during the production shoots. The money will also be used to pay some of the crew members.</p>
<p>If you donate to our project, there are several perks that you will receive. If you cannot donate, you can still help by sharing this campaign!</p>
<p>If we do not reach our entire goal, we will still make this music video, but we will cut our budget down.</p>

<p>Hello INDIEGOGO! My name is Rob and this is my pre-production campaign for </p>
<p><strong>TOPshelf - the universal media device mounting system!</strong></p>
<p> What is TOPshelf? TOPshelf is the answer to the question</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""Where do I put this?""</i></p>
<p>The development of this project came from my 1 year old playing with cables on a Fire TV box sitting on a cabinet in the open. Of course we did not want her to play with this for obvious safety reasons so I needed to figure out somewhere to put the device out of the little ones reach. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507952877/jxu27cgffqb55xtdiasb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>What I eventually came up with is something that I think there is a real need for and from my success with my first campaign I feel that the concept is valid and I am moving forward with tooling up for production. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507951457/ey2yzhrjswfmkuqowapk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>What I didn't realize is that starting a business has so many hidden costs!  I am moving forward with getting this production ready but my funds are limited. I've got an almost 2 year old (the culprit above) and I will have a newborn the beginning of December so most of my income is not, let's say, spendable. The more support I can get with this pre-production campaign the easier it will be for me to really get the business details finalized and get TOPshelf out there. </p>
<p>You may need this and I want to get this out there to help people because it does solve that question... not like this!</p>

<p>No drilling, no exposed wiring, no complicated installation, and this works for almost any device. Small cable boxes, Direct TV Genie, line-of-sight devices are ideal for this but it also works for any of the streaming devices like Apple TV, Fire TV, Roku, etc. </p>
<p>TOPshelf is the answer!</p>

<p>Crowdfunding is new to me and I am learning along the way and it has been fun, challenging, and rewarding. I've learned that responding to questions and actually delivering are obviously very important... Yes, as a consumer I agree 5000%!</p>
<p>Since I can't answer your questions before they are asked I can say that as of today my delivery for December is still on plan. Only concern I have at this point is if I could run out of parts... I might put an extra 500 on order just to be safe but not sure yet.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As I have worked through this there have been many challenges but realistically the only challenge that I have now is delivery if orders are higher than I expect. Part of this add-on campaign for me is to see what the level of interest is and if I can get a decent feel for inventory needs.</p>
<p>Not knowing monthly order forecasting for this leaves me open to early delivery issues... This campaign could help me to better understand and plan my stock levels a little early which I would love to be able to do.  </p>
<p>Last thing for me on this is that if you see somewhere that TOPshelf could be used, take a pic and send it to me! I'm a novice at social media marketing but I am trying and feedback of any kind is really appreciated.</p>

I am also author of a handful of books about the use of flowers in the therapeutic field.

His musical explorations range from solo piano, choral and concert music to Contemporary Christian and worship music for the church. Peter has already recorded four solo piano albums: <a href=""http://www.petervantine.com/release/prayerful-improvisations-1/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong><i>Prayerful Improvisations</i></strong></a>, <a href=""http://www.petervantine.com/release/prayerful-improvisations-2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i><strong>Prayerful Improvisations 2</strong></i></a> , <a href=""http://www.petervantine.com/release/prayerful-improvisations-christmas/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i><strong>Prayerful Improvisations: Christmas</strong></i></a> and <a href=""http://www.petervantine.com/release/peaceful-classics/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i><strong>Peaceful Classics</strong></i></a>. I learned of Peter and his music from his previous Kickstarter campaigns, as a musician who is gifted to translate into music what flowers can tell us. I have been using his music in my practice for about two years now and love to see people find new hope and inner strength through listening to it in the therapeutic setting.</p><h3>
<br/>WHY IMPROVISATION?</h3><p>Improvisation doesn’t mean there’s an absence of structure. When I was teaching, I’d often have conversations with my students about improvising within the structure. So often a young musician wants to just go hog wild and play any blessed thing they feel like playing, but this is not true improvisation. Sure, some of the more <i>avant garde </i>musicians will push the boundaries . . . but though they are pushing the limits of the structure, there is STILL structure. When improvising within a structure, there is a freedom that is more profound and more rewarding than if there was an absence of structure. Playing notes randomly without any structure is just that: random. Structure, in this case, births freedom. I realize on the surface it sounds contradictory, but when the musician learns to be free within a particular structure, it is empowering. This musical process provides a more free, almost spiritual, approach to recording and lends itself well to the creation of music for healing.</p><h3>
<br/>FLOWERS &amp; LISTENING</h3><p>Like the famous French otolaryngologist Dr. Tomatis said, <i>""The ear is not just another piece of skin - The skin is a specialized part of the ear.""</i> How right he is. Scientists found out that the special cells in the inner ear called the cochlea that enable us to hear are very much the same as the ones in our skin that let us notice touch and vibration. With a little training everyone can listen with his whole body. That is what I teach clients who come for help. But there is more to it. Music has a special effect on the brain, it kind of switches off the amygdala, the part where traumas, bad memories and fear are stored. The amygdala’s task is to make us avoid danger. However it all too often takes action when we are challenged and keeps us from achieving what we really desire. It is meant as a kind of protection, but in fact sometimes it protects problems from being solved. This often causes people to avoid facing painful issues. Music is a means to relax the amygdala and help people to cope with pain.</p><p>The archetypal language of flowers can support the healing process. When I researched the impact of certain flowers on pregnant women in the 1990s I was amazed, for example, how often pomegranate came up spontaneously in their dreams and visualizations. An artist who had become a mother even gave me a painting of pomegranates as a little thank you. That was no accident. I learned that pomegranate was the fruit of the Greek Goddess Aphrodite and others. A friend of mine came back from a journey to Jordan and told me how girls use the fruit as a kind of oracle. They throw the fruit on the ground and the number of seeds that fall out indicate the number of children they will have. So it came hardly as a surprise that scientists discovered estrogen-like ingredients in them. People know intuitively about the essence of flowers. This is why one of the inspirational tunes will be about pomegranate, which will help to get in touch with the inner woman. Another one will be about sunflower, the inner man.</p><p>Along with the pomegranate and sunflower, the accompanying archetypal plants and flowers to be included on this album are:</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Pear – the mother<br/>Bougainvillea – the poet<br/>Sunflower – the man<br/>Pomegranate – the woman<br/>Cherry – the lover<br/>Touch-Me-Not Balsam – the innocent<br/>White Yarrow – the hero<br/>Fireweed – the healer<br/>Borage – the mourner<br/>Pineapple Weed – the student</i></p><h3>

His songs will be used in my practice, too, and they will be the basis for further sonic developments. Some of these will be available at a later date for supporters of this campaign. For example, Peter’s songs embedded in meditative tunes of 15-minute length using so-called binaural beats (associated with alpha brainwave patterns) that will gently guide you into states of relaxation.</p><p><strong>For those living in the Netherlands or near the border</strong>, another way to support the production of the album is to schedule a hypnotic session with me.

Warum „Flowers“? Das war meine Idee. Ich, Dirk Albrodt, erforsche als Naturheilkundler die Geschichte und die Heilkräfte von Pflanzen. Ich habe eine Handvoll Bücher über die Anwendung von Blüten auf dem therapeutischen Gebiet geschrieben. Über 25 Jahre lang verwende ich Musik nun schon in meiner Praxis, um eine stützende und heilsame Atmosphäre für meine Klienten zu schaffen. Mir wurde schnell klar, dass Musik nicht allein beruhigende Wirkung besitzt.</p><h3>Wer ist Peter Vantine?</h3><p>Peter Vantine, Komposer, Pianist und Leiter von Gottesdiensten, komponiert, spielt und nimmt seine Musik seit 30 Jahren auf. Seine musikalische Bandbreite umfasst Solopiano, Choräle und Konzerte bis hin zu Contemporary Christian und Musik für Gottesdienste.<br/>Peter hat bisher drei Soloalben eingespielt: »Prayerful Improvisations«, »Prayerful Improvisations 2« und »Peaceful Classics«. Ich lernte Peter durch seine früheren Kickstarter Kampagnen kennen. Er ist ein Musiker mit dem ausgesprochenen Talent, die Botschaft der Blüten musikalisch auszudrücken. In meiner Praxis verwende ich seine Musik seit über zwei Jahren. Es ist eine große Freude zu sehen, wie Klienten in einem therapeutischen Setting durch sie neue Hoffnung und innere Kraft finden.</p><h3>Warum Improvisation?</h3><p>Improvisation ist nicht gleichbedeutend mit Abwesenheit von Struktur. Im Unterricht fragen mich meine Schüler oft nach Improvisation innerhalb einer Struktur. Oft wollen junge Musiker wild drauflos spielen und alles, was ihnen in den Sinn kommt, hören lassen, aber das ist nicht wahre Improvisation. Sicher, einige der avantgardistischen Musiker testen ihre Grenzen aus ... aber auch wenn sie die Grenzen der Struktur erweitern, bleibt es dennoch Struktur. Improvisieren innerhalb einer solchen Struktur gibt eine viel tiefere und befriedigerende Freiheit als die komplette Abwesenheit davon. Einfach irgendwelche willkürlichen Noten zu spielen ist am Ende nur eins: Willkür. Struktur hingegen gebiert Freiheit. Mir ist schon klar, dass dies bei oberflächlicher Betrachtung widersprüchlich klingen mag. Wenn ein Musiker jedoch lernt, innerhalb einer gewissen Struktur frei zu sein, ist das enorm kräftigend. Der musikalische Prozess bietet eine freieren, beinahe spirituellen Zugang zur Aufnahme und eignet sich ausgezeichnet für die Erschaffung von Musik, die heilsam wirkt.</p><h3>Blüten &amp; Lauschen</h3><p>Der französische HNO-Arzt und Begründer der Audio-Psycho-Phonologie sagte einmal „Das Ohr ist nicht einfach ein Stück Haut - die Haut ist ein spezialisiertes Stück Ohr.“ Wie Recht er hat. Wissenschaftler fanden heraus, das besondere Zellen im Innenohr (genauer: der Cochlea = Hörschnecke), die unser Hören ermöglichen, denjenigen Zellen in der Haut, die die Wahrnehmung Berührung und Vibration möglich machen, deutlich ähneln. <br/>Mit ein wenig Training kann jeder Mensch mit seinem ganzen Körper hören. Das gehört zu den Fähigkeiten, die ich die Menschen lehre, die zu mir in Behandlung kommen. Doch das ist nicht alles. Musik hat eine besondere Wirkung auf das Gehirn, man könnte beinahe sagen, sie knipst die Amygdala aus, also den Teil, der Traumata, schlechte Erinnerungen und Angst speichert und steuert. Die Aufgabe der Amygdala ist, uns Gefahren vermeiden zu lassen. Andererseits kann eine Art Überaktivität uns auch vom Handeln abhalten, wenn wir vor einer Herausforderung stehen, und uns so von dem fernhalten, was wir ersehnen. Die schützend gemeinte Funktion kann sich damit auch problemkonservierend erweisen, denn das Problem wird nicht gelöst sondern gemieden. Menschen vermeiden dann, sich schmerzhaften Bereichen in ihrem Leben zu stellen, womit diese ihnen jedoch erhalten bleiben. Musik ist ein wunderbares Hilfsmittel, die Amygdala zu entspannen, und dies wiederum ermöglicht es den Klienten, sich der Auseinandersetzung mit dem Schmerz zu stellen.<br/>Die archetypische Sprache der Blüten kann den Heilungsprozess unterstützen. Als ich in den 90er Jahren die Wirkung bestimmter Blüten auf schwangere Frauen erforschte, erstaunte mich beispielsweise, wie oft der Granatapfel spontan in ihren Träumen und Meditationen vorkam. Eine Künstlerin schenkte mir nach der Geburt ihres Kindes als Dankeschön ein Stillleben mit Granatäpfeln. Das konnte kein Zufall sein. Ich lernte, dass der Granatapfel die Frucht der griechischen Göttin Aphrodite war. Zurück von einer Reise nach Jordanien berichtete eine Freundin vom dortigen Gebrauch der Frucht als Orakel. Junge Mädchen werfen einen Granatapfel auf den Boden und zählen die herausfallenden Samen. Deren Anzahl soll der Anzahl der zu erwartenden Kinder entsprechen. Es war dann keine Überraschung mehr zu erfahren, dass Wissenschaftler östrogenartige Stoffe im Granatapfel entdeckt hatten. Die Menschen erkennen die wesentlichen Charakteristika einer Pflanze intuitiv. Kein Wunder, dass eines der inspirierenden Stücke Granatapfel zum Thema haben wird. Es soll den Zuhörern helfen, Zugang zur inneren Frau in sich selbst zu finden. Ein anderes wird die Musik der Sonnenblume hören lassen, gewissermaßen die Stimme des inneren Mannes.<br/>Neben Granatapfel und Sonnenblume werden folgende archetypische Pflanzen musikalisch portraitiert:</p><p><strong>Birne</strong> – die Mutter<br/><strong>Sonnenblume</strong> - der Mann<br/><strong>Granatapfel </strong>- die Frau<br/><strong>Bougainvillea</strong> – der Poet<br/><strong>Kirsche</strong> – der Liebende<br/><strong>Echtes Springkraut</strong> – der Unschuldige<br/><strong>Weiße Schafgarbe</strong> – der Held<br/><strong>Weidenröschen</strong> – der Heiler<br/><strong>Borretsch </strong>– der Trauernde<br/><strong>Strahlenlose Kamille</strong> – der Lernende</p><h3>Mehr über das Projekt</h3><p>Das Album wird als CD und als Download erhältlich sein. Es wird mit Peters Bösendorfer Grand Piano aufgenommen, einem handwerklichen Meisterstück und ausgezeichnet klingendem Instrument (mit vier zusätzlichen Noten am unteren Ende des Keyboards). Auch wenn das gesamte Album in Peters eigenem Studio aufgenommen wird, fallen doch einige ganz reale Kosten an. Dazu gehörendas Stimmen des Instruments, das Mixen und Mastern, das Graphikdesign, das Pressen der CD und weitere administrative Kosten wie Versand u.ä.</p><p>Das Album, das Peter aufnehmen wird, ist für alle, die inspirierende, beruhigende und meditative Pianomusik lieben. Seine Lieder werden auch in meiner Praxis Verwendung finden, und sie dienen als Basis für weitere klangtherapeutische Entwicklungen. Einige davon werden den Unterstützern der Kampagne erhältlich sein. Zum Beispiel werden Peter Lieder in therapeutische Klangsessions von ca 15 Minuten Länge mit sogenannten binaural Beats unterlegt, die einen sanft in Entspannungszustände bringen, die mit Alpha Gehirnwellen assoziiert sind, wie man sie beispielsweise beim autogenen Training entwickelt.<br/>Diejenigen Unterstützer, die in den Niederlanden oder nahe der Grenze leben, können eine hypnotherapeutische Session bei mir buchen, bei der Flowers Anwendung finden wird, um unser Produktion möglich zu machen. Ich werde diejenigen in einen Trancezustand führen, in dem man eine audio-taktile Synästhesie erleben kann, was den gesamten Körper zum Resonanzkörper für Musik macht, kurzum: Man lernt mit dem ganzen Körper zu hören. Auf Wunsch können wir natürlich auch andere Musik verwenden.<br/>Diejenigen, die deutsch sprechen, können das Projekt durch die Bestellung eines meiner Bücher fördern. Sie können mit der Musik zusammen signierte Exemplare von „Blütenessenzen in der Schwangerschaft“ und/oder „Illustrierte Enzyklopädie der einheimischen Blütenessenzen“ vorbestellen.</p><h3>Risiken und Herausforderungen</h3><p>Das Recording wird nach Beginn dieser Kampagne 4 bis 6 Wochen dauern, danach folgt noch eine Phase, in der Zweitaufnahmen gemacht und weiteres Material aufgenommen wird, das für die endgültige Produktion verwendet werden wird. Insgesamt wird mehr Musik aufgenommen als letztendlich auf CD erscheinen wird. Auch der Zeitplan des Technikers spielt im Ablauf eine wichtige Rolle, schließlich muss das Instrument vor jeder Aufnahmesession neu gestimmt werden.<br/>Peters Erfahrung bei der Musikproduktion ermöglicht ihm, alles bis ins kleinste Details zu planen und durchzuführen. Natürlich gibt es immer wieder unvorhergesehene Hindernisse, welche den Fortgang des Projekts verzögern können, aber wir sind beide sehr zuversichtlich, dass alles wie geplant im anvisierten Zeitraum verlaufen wird.<br/>Ich werde gerne alle Fragen bezüglich des Projekts beantworten und alle Unterstüzter auf dem Laufenden halten.</p><p>..................................</p><h2>FLOWERS – SOLO PIANO ALBUM</h2><p>Rustige en ontspannende solo piano improvisaties geïnspireerd door helende planten en bloemen. »Flowers« zal een verzameling van 10 solo piano improvisaties op basis van bepaalde planten en bloemen, uitgevoerd door pianist / componist Peter Vantine zijn. Waarom bloemen? Dat was mijn idee. Ik, Dirk Albrodt, ben een therapeut en onderzoeker van de geschiedenis en de helende eigenschappen van bloemen en planten. Ik ben ook de auteur van een handvol boeken over het gebruik van bloemen op het therapeutische gebied. Al meer dan 25 jaar heb ik muziek in mijn praktijk gebruikt met het oog op een ondersteunende en genezende sfeer te creëren. Het werd al snel duidelijk dat er meer in muziek zit dan alleen haar rustgevend effect.</p><h3>Wie is Peter Vantine?</h3><p>Peter Vantine, componist, pianist en godsdienstleider schrijft muziek en neemt haar al meer dan 30 jaar op. Zijn muzikale verkenningen variëren van solo piano, koor en concert muziek Contemporary Christian en aanbidding muziek voor de kerk.<br/>Peter heeft al drie solo piano albums opgenomen: »Prayerful Improvisations«, »Prayerful Improvisaties 2« en »Peaceful Classics«. Ik leerde Peter en zijn muziek door zijn vorige Kickstarter campagne als een muzikant kennen die kan wat bloemen ons vertellen vertalen in muziek. Ik heb zijn muziek nu meer dan twee jaar lang in mijn praktijk gebruikt en houd ervan om te zien how mensen nieuwe hoop en kracht vinden door het beluisteren in een therapeutisch setting.</p><h3>Waarom improvisatie?</h3><p>Improvisatie betekent niet dat gebrek aan structuur. Toen ik les gaf, had ik vaak gesprekken met mijn studenten over improviseren binnen de structuur. Zo vaak wilde een jonge muzikant gewoon heel wild spelen van hem te binnen schot en wat hij voelde, maar dit is niet echte improvisatie. Zeker, sommige van de meer avant-gardistische muzikanten verleggen de grenzen. . . maar hoewel ze tegen de grenzen van de structuur botsen, is er desondanks nog structuur. Wanneer je binnen een structuur improviseert, is er een vrijheid die dieper en bevredigender is dan wanneer er structuur helemaal afwezig is. Noten willekeurig spelen zonder enige structuur is alleen dat: willekeurig. Structuur, in dit geval, baart vrijheid. Ik realiseer me dat dit op het oppervlak tegenstrijdig klinkt, maar wanneer de muzikant leert om vrij te zijn binnen een bepaalde structuur, is het machtigend. Deze muzikale proces zorgt voor een meer vrije, bijna spiritueele benadering van het opnemen en eigent zich goed voor de creatie van muziek voor genezing.</p><h3>Bloesems en luisteren</h3><p>De beroemde Franse KNO-arts Dr. Tomatis zei »Het oor is niet zomaar een stukje huid - De huid is een gespecialiseerd deel van het oor« en gelijk heeft hij. Wetenschappers ontdekten dat de speciale cellen in het binnenoor, het slakkenhuis, die ons in staat brengen om te horen in grote lijnen dezelfden zijn als die in onze huid, die ons aanrakingen en trillingen laten opmerken. Met een beetje training kan iedereen met zijn hele lichaam luisteren. Dat is wat ik cliënten leer die voor hulp komen. Maar er is meer aan de hand. Muziek heeft een bijzonder effect op de hersenen, je kunt haast zeggen dat ze de amygdala uitschakelt, het deel van ons brein waar trauma, slechte herinneringen en angst worden opgeslagen. De taak van de amygdala is om ons te helpen om gevaar te vermijden. Helaas wordt al te vaak de amygdala actief wanneer we worden uitgedaagd en weerhoudt ons van het bereiken van wat we echt willen. Het is bedoeld als een soort bescherming, maar in feite beschermt het problemen van opgelost worden. Dit veroorzaakt vaak dat mensen alles doen om de confrontatie met pijnlijke kwesties te vermijden. Muziek is een middel om de amygdala te ontspannen en mensen met pijn te kunnen helpen.<br/>De archetypische taal van bloemen kan het genezingsproces ondersteunen. Toen ik de impact van bepaalde bloemen op zwangere vrouwen in de jaren 90 onderzocht was ik verbaasd hoe vaak bijvoorbeeld granaatappel spontaan in hun dromen en visualisaties voorkwam. Een kunstenaares die net moeder was geworden gaf me zelfs een schilderij van granaatappels als een bedankje. Dat was geen toeval. Ik heb geleerd dat granaatappel de vrucht van de Griekse godin Aphrodite en anderen was. Een vriend van mij kwam terug van een reis naar Jordanië en vertelde me hoe meisjes de vrucht als een soort orakel gebruiken. Ze gooien het fruit op de grond en het aantal zaden die er uitvallen geven het aantal kinderen aan dat ze zullen krijgen. Dus kwam het nauwelijks als een verrassing dat wetenschappers oestrogeen-achtige ingrediënten in hen ontdekten. Mensen kennen over het wezenlijke van planten intuïtief. Geen wonder dat een van de inspirerende stukken granaatappel als thema zal hebben. Het zal helpen in contact te komen met de innerlijke vrouw. Een ander zal over zonnebloem gaan, de innerlijke man.<br/>Samen met granaatappel en zonnebloem worden de volgende bijbehorende archetypische planten en bloemen op dit album opgenomen:<br/><strong>Peer</strong> - de moeder<br/><strong>Bougainvillea</strong> - de dichter<br/><strong>Kers</strong> - de minnaar<br/><strong>Groot springzaad</strong> - de onschuldige<br/><strong>Wit Duizendblad</strong> - de held<br/><strong>Wilgenroosje</strong> - de genezer<br/><strong>Komkommerkruid</strong> - de rouwende<br/><strong>Schijfkamille</strong> - de student</p><h3>Meer over dit project</h3><p>Het album zal beschikbaar zijn als download en hardcopy (CD). Het zal worden opgenomen op Peter’s Bösendorfer vleugel, een prachtig vormgegeven en klinkend instrument (met vier extra noten aan de onderkant van het toetsenbord!).Hoewel het hele album in Peter’s thuisstudio zal worden opgenomen, zijn er een aantal zeer reële extra kosten die nodig zijn voor het produceren van een album project. Deze omvatten piano tuning, mixen, mastering, grafisch ontwerp voor het CD hoesje, productie kosten voor de CD’s (1000 stuks), en een aantal administratieve kosten inclusief verzendkosten en verdere benodigdheden.<br/>Het album Peter gaat nemen is voor iedereen die houdt van inspirerende, kalmerende en meditatieve pianomuziek. Zijn songs worden ook in mijn praktijk gebruikt, en ze zullen de basis vormen voor verdere sonische ontwikkelingen. Sommige ervan zullen op een later tijdstip voor de aanhangers van deze campagne beschikbaar zijn. Bijvoorbeeld, Peters songs ingebed in een meditatief achtergrond van 15 minuten lengte met behulp van zogenaamde binaural beats, die je zachtjes in toestanden van ontspanning zullen leiden, die worden geassocieerd met alpha hersengolfpatronen.<br/>Degenen die in Nederland wonen of in de buurt van de grens kunnen ter ondersteuning van de productie van het album een hypnotische sessie met mij boeken. Ik zal je naar een trance toestand begeleiden waarin je door audio-tactiele synesthesie kunt ervaren, wat het betekent om de muziek met je huid te horen. We kunnen Peters muziek gebruiken of een andere die je op deze manier wilt beleven.<br/>Voor degenen onder u die de Duitse taal begrijpen kunnen dit project steunen door het bestellen van een van mijn boeken (die ik zal signeren) samen met het album, zoals „Blütenessenzen in der Schwangerschaft“ en / of „Illustrierte Enzyklopädie der Blütenessenzen“.</p><h3>Risico’s en uitdagingen</h3><p>Het opnemen van het album zal ongeveer vier weken tijdens de maand van juli duren. Dit moet voldoende tijd om meer materiaal dan wordt gebruikt in het eindproduct op te nemen. Zo kunnen de beste opnamen worden geselecteerd om te worden opgenomen in het album. Uiteraard zal dit afhangen van het plannen van de piano technicus, omdat de piano moet voor elke sessie worden afgestemd, maar de gecontracteerde technicus is zeer betrouwbaar. <br/>Peters ervaring in de muziek productie heeft hem geleert om een project met succes tot in de kleinste details te plannen en uit te voeren. Terwijl onbekende factoren hebben de neiging om tijdens een project op te duiken en de voortgang te vertragen, We zijn beiden overtuigd dit project soepel zal verlopen in de aangegeven tijd.<br/>Ik ben blij om eventuele vragen of opmerkingen te beantwoorden en zal u steeds over de voortgang van het project op de hoogte houden.</p></div>","Die deutschsprachige Beschreibung finden Sie mit ein wenig scrollen...De nederlandse vertaling vind je iets verder beneden.FLOWERS – SOLO PIANO ALBUMPeaceful and relaxing solo piano improvisations inspired by healing flowers.Flowers will be a collection of 10 solo piano improvisations based on certain plants and flowers, performed by pianist/composer Peter Vantine. Why flowers? That was my idea. Me, Dirk Albrodt. I am a therapist and researcher of the history and the healing qualities of flowers. I am also author of a handful of books about the use of flowers in the therapeutic field. For more than 25 years I have used music in my practice in order to create a supportive and healing atmosphere. It quickly became obvious that there is more to  music than just its soothing effect.
WHO IS PETER VANTINE?Peter Vantine, a composer, pianist and worship leader has been writing and recording music for over 30 years. His musical explorations range from solo piano, choral and concert music to Contemporary Christian and worship music for the church.

Wissenschaftler fanden heraus, das besondere Zellen im Innenohr (genauer: der Cochlea = Hörschnecke), die unser Hören ermöglichen, denjenigen Zellen in der Haut, die die Wahrnehmung Berührung und Vibration möglich machen, deutlich ähneln. Mit ein wenig Training kann jeder Mensch mit seinem ganzen Körper hören. Das gehört zu den Fähigkeiten, die ich die Menschen lehre, die zu mir in Behandlung kommen. Doch das ist nicht alles. Musik hat eine besondere Wirkung auf das Gehirn, man könnte beinahe sagen, sie knipst die Amygdala aus, also den Teil, der Traumata, schlechte Erinnerungen und Angst speichert und steuert. Die Aufgabe der Amygdala ist, uns Gefahren vermeiden zu lassen. Andererseits kann eine Art Überaktivität uns auch vom Handeln abhalten, wenn wir vor einer Herausforderung stehen, und uns so von dem fernhalten, was wir ersehnen. Die schützend gemeinte Funktion kann sich damit auch problemkonservierend erweisen, denn das Problem wird nicht gelöst sondern gemieden. Menschen vermeiden dann, sich schmerzhaften Bereichen in ihrem Leben zu stellen, womit diese ihnen jedoch erhalten bleiben. Musik ist ein wunderbares Hilfsmittel, die Amygdala zu entspannen, und dies wiederum ermöglicht es den Klienten, sich der Auseinandersetzung mit dem Schmerz zu stellen.Die archetypische Sprache der Blüten kann den Heilungsprozess unterstützen. Als ich in den 90er Jahren die Wirkung bestimmter Blüten auf schwangere Frauen erforschte, erstaunte mich beispielsweise, wie oft der Granatapfel spontan in ihren Träumen und Meditationen vorkam. Eine Künstlerin schenkte mir nach der Geburt ihres Kindes als Dankeschön ein Stillleben mit Granatäpfeln. Das konnte kein Zufall sein. Ich lernte, dass der Granatapfel die Frucht der griechischen Göttin Aphrodite war. Zurück von einer Reise nach Jordanien berichtete eine Freundin vom dortigen Gebrauch der Frucht als Orakel. Junge Mädchen werfen einen Granatapfel auf den Boden und zählen die herausfallenden Samen. Deren Anzahl soll der Anzahl der zu erwartenden Kinder entsprechen. Es war dann keine Überraschung mehr zu erfahren, dass Wissenschaftler östrogenartige Stoffe im Granatapfel entdeckt hatten. Die Menschen erkennen die wesentlichen Charakteristika einer Pflanze intuitiv. Kein Wunder, dass eines der inspirierenden Stücke Granatapfel zum Thema haben wird. Es soll den Zuhörern helfen, Zugang zur inneren Frau in sich selbst zu finden. Ein anderes wird die Musik der Sonnenblume hören lassen, gewissermaßen die Stimme des inneren Mannes.Neben Granatapfel und Sonnenblume werden folgende archetypische Pflanzen musikalisch portraitiert:Birne – die MutterSonnenblume - der MannGranatapfel - die FrauBougainvillea – der PoetKirsche – der LiebendeEchtes Springkraut – der UnschuldigeWeiße Schafgarbe – der HeldWeidenröschen – der HeilerBorretsch – der TrauerndeStrahlenlose Kamille – der LernendeMehr über das ProjektDas Album wird als CD und als Download erhältlich sein. Es wird mit Peters Bösendorfer Grand Piano aufgenommen, einem handwerklichen Meisterstück und ausgezeichnet klingendem Instrument (mit vier zusätzlichen Noten am unteren Ende des Keyboards). Auch wenn das gesamte Album in Peters eigenem Studio aufgenommen wird, fallen doch einige ganz reale Kosten an. Dazu gehörendas Stimmen des Instruments, das Mixen und Mastern, das Graphikdesign, das Pressen der CD und weitere administrative Kosten wie Versand u.ä.Das Album, das Peter aufnehmen wird, ist für alle, die inspirierende, beruhigende und meditative Pianomusik lieben. Seine Lieder werden auch in meiner Praxis Verwendung finden, und sie dienen als Basis für weitere klangtherapeutische Entwicklungen. Einige davon werden den Unterstützern der Kampagne erhältlich sein. Zum Beispiel werden Peter Lieder in therapeutische Klangsessions von ca 15 Minuten Länge mit sogenannten binaural Beats unterlegt, die einen sanft in Entspannungszustände bringen, die mit Alpha Gehirnwellen assoziiert sind, wie man sie beispielsweise beim autogenen Training entwickelt.Diejenigen Unterstützer, die in den Niederlanden oder nahe der Grenze leben, können eine hypnotherapeutische Session bei mir buchen, bei der Flowers Anwendung finden wird, um unser Produktion möglich zu machen. Ich werde diejenigen in einen Trancezustand führen, in dem man eine audio-taktile Synästhesie erleben kann, was den gesamten Körper zum Resonanzkörper für Musik macht, kurzum: Man lernt mit dem ganzen Körper zu hören. Auf Wunsch können wir natürlich auch andere Musik verwenden.Diejenigen, die deutsch sprechen, können das Projekt durch die Bestellung eines meiner Bücher fördern. Sie können mit der Musik zusammen signierte Exemplare von „Blütenessenzen in der Schwangerschaft“ und/oder „Illustrierte Enzyklopädie der einheimischen Blütenessenzen“ vorbestellen.Risiken und HerausforderungenDas Recording wird nach Beginn dieser Kampagne 4 bis 6 Wochen dauern, danach folgt noch eine Phase, in der Zweitaufnahmen gemacht und weiteres Material aufgenommen wird, das für die endgültige Produktion verwendet werden wird. Insgesamt wird mehr Musik aufgenommen als letztendlich auf CD erscheinen wird. Auch der Zeitplan des Technikers spielt im Ablauf eine wichtige Rolle, schließlich muss das Instrument vor jeder Aufnahmesession neu gestimmt werden.Peters Erfahrung bei der Musikproduktion ermöglicht ihm, alles bis ins kleinste Details zu planen und durchzuführen. Natürlich gibt es immer wieder unvorhergesehene Hindernisse, welche den Fortgang des Projekts verzögern können, aber wir sind beide sehr zuversichtlich, dass alles wie geplant im anvisierten Zeitraum verlaufen wird.Ich werde gerne alle Fragen bezüglich des Projekts beantworten und alle Unterstüzter auf dem Laufenden halten...................................FLOWERS – SOLO PIANO ALBUMRustige en ontspannende solo piano improvisaties geïnspireerd door helende planten en bloemen. »Flowers« zal een verzameling van 10 solo piano improvisaties op basis van bepaalde planten en bloemen, uitgevoerd door pianist / componist Peter Vantine zijn. Waarom bloemen? Dat was mijn idee. Ik, Dirk Albrodt, ben een therapeut en onderzoeker van de geschiedenis en de helende eigenschappen van bloemen en planten. Ik ben ook de auteur van een handvol boeken over het gebruik van bloemen op het therapeutische gebied. Al meer dan 25 jaar heb ik muziek in mijn praktijk gebruikt met het oog op een ondersteunende en genezende sfeer te creëren. Het werd al snel duidelijk dat er meer in muziek zit dan alleen haar rustgevend effect.Wie is Peter Vantine?Peter Vantine, componist, pianist en godsdienstleider schrijft muziek en neemt haar al meer dan 30 jaar op. Zijn muzikale verkenningen variëren van solo piano, koor en concert muziek Contemporary Christian en aanbidding muziek voor de kerk.Peter heeft al drie solo piano albums opgenomen: »Prayerful Improvisations«, »Prayerful Improvisaties 2« en »Peaceful Classics«. Ik leerde Peter en zijn muziek door zijn vorige Kickstarter campagne als een muzikant kennen die kan wat bloemen ons vertellen vertalen in muziek. Ik heb zijn muziek nu meer dan twee jaar lang in mijn praktijk gebruikt en houd ervan om te zien how mensen nieuwe hoop en kracht vinden door het beluisteren in een therapeutisch setting.Waarom improvisatie?Improvisatie betekent niet dat gebrek aan structuur. Toen ik les gaf, had ik vaak gesprekken met mijn studenten over improviseren binnen de structuur. Zo vaak wilde een jonge muzikant gewoon heel wild spelen van hem te binnen schot en wat hij voelde, maar dit is niet echte improvisatie. Zeker, sommige van de meer avant-gardistische muzikanten verleggen de grenzen. . . maar hoewel ze tegen de grenzen van de structuur botsen, is er desondanks nog structuur. Wanneer je binnen een structuur improviseert, is er een vrijheid die dieper en bevredigender is dan wanneer er structuur helemaal afwezig is. Noten willekeurig spelen zonder enige structuur is alleen dat: willekeurig. Structuur, in dit geval, baart vrijheid. Ik realiseer me dat dit op het oppervlak tegenstrijdig klinkt, maar wanneer de muzikant leert om vrij te zijn binnen een bepaalde structuur, is het machtigend. Deze muzikale proces zorgt voor een meer vrije, bijna spiritueele benadering van het opnemen en eigent zich goed voor de creatie van muziek voor genezing.Bloesems en luisterenDe beroemde Franse KNO-arts Dr. Tomatis zei »Het oor is niet zomaar een stukje huid - De huid is een gespecialiseerd deel van het oor« en gelijk heeft hij. Wetenschappers ontdekten dat de speciale cellen in het binnenoor, het slakkenhuis, die ons in staat brengen om te horen in grote lijnen dezelfden zijn als die in onze huid, die ons aanrakingen en trillingen laten opmerken. Met een beetje training kan iedereen met zijn hele lichaam luisteren. Dat is wat ik cliënten leer die voor hulp komen. Maar er is meer aan de hand. Muziek heeft een bijzonder effect op de hersenen, je kunt haast zeggen dat ze de amygdala uitschakelt, het deel van ons brein waar trauma, slechte herinneringen en angst worden opgeslagen. De taak van de amygdala is om ons te helpen om gevaar te vermijden. Helaas wordt al te vaak de amygdala actief wanneer we worden uitgedaagd en weerhoudt ons van het bereiken van wat we echt willen. Het is bedoeld als een soort bescherming, maar in feite beschermt het problemen van opgelost worden. Dit veroorzaakt vaak dat mensen alles doen om de confrontatie met pijnlijke kwesties te vermijden. Muziek is een middel om de amygdala te ontspannen en mensen met pijn te kunnen helpen.De archetypische taal van bloemen kan het genezingsproces ondersteunen. Toen ik de impact van bepaalde bloemen op zwangere vrouwen in de jaren 90 onderzocht was ik verbaasd hoe vaak bijvoorbeeld granaatappel spontaan in hun dromen en visualisaties voorkwam. Een kunstenaares die net moeder was geworden gaf me zelfs een schilderij van granaatappels als een bedankje. Dat was geen toeval. Ik heb geleerd dat granaatappel de vrucht van de Griekse godin Aphrodite en anderen was. Een vriend van mij kwam terug van een reis naar Jordanië en vertelde me hoe meisjes de vrucht als een soort orakel gebruiken. Ze gooien het fruit op de grond en het aantal zaden die er uitvallen geven het aantal kinderen aan dat ze zullen krijgen. Dus kwam het nauwelijks als een verrassing dat wetenschappers oestrogeen-achtige ingrediënten in hen ontdekten. Mensen kennen over het wezenlijke van planten intuïtief. Geen wonder dat een van de inspirerende stukken granaatappel als thema zal hebben. Het zal helpen in contact te komen met de innerlijke vrouw. Een ander zal over zonnebloem gaan, de innerlijke man.Samen met granaatappel en zonnebloem worden de volgende bijbehorende archetypische planten en bloemen op dit album opgenomen:Peer - de moederBougainvillea - de dichterKers - de minnaarGroot springzaad - de onschuldigeWit Duizendblad - de heldWilgenroosje - de genezerKomkommerkruid - de rouwendeSchijfkamille - de studentMeer over dit projectHet album zal beschikbaar zijn als download en hardcopy (CD). Het zal worden opgenomen op Peter’s Bösendorfer vleugel, een prachtig vormgegeven en klinkend instrument (met vier extra noten aan de onderkant van het toetsenbord!).Hoewel het hele album in Peter’s thuisstudio zal worden opgenomen, zijn er een aantal zeer reële extra kosten die nodig zijn voor het produceren van een album project. Deze omvatten piano tuning, mixen, mastering, grafisch ontwerp voor het CD hoesje, productie kosten voor de CD’s (1000 stuks), en een aantal administratieve kosten inclusief verzendkosten en verdere benodigdheden.Het album Peter gaat nemen is voor iedereen die houdt van inspirerende, kalmerende en meditatieve pianomuziek. Zijn songs worden ook in mijn praktijk gebruikt, en ze zullen de basis vormen voor verdere sonische ontwikkelingen. Sommige ervan zullen op een later tijdstip voor de aanhangers van deze campagne beschikbaar zijn. Bijvoorbeeld, Peters songs ingebed in een meditatief achtergrond van 15 minuten lengte met behulp van zogenaamde binaural beats, die je zachtjes in toestanden van ontspanning zullen leiden, die worden geassocieerd met alpha hersengolfpatronen.Degenen die in Nederland wonen of in de buurt van de grens kunnen ter ondersteuning van de productie van het album een hypnotische sessie met mij boeken. Ik zal je naar een trance toestand begeleiden waarin je door audio-tactiele synesthesie kunt ervaren, wat het betekent om de muziek met je huid te horen. We kunnen Peters muziek gebruiken of een andere die je op deze manier wilt beleven.Voor degenen onder u die de Duitse taal begrijpen kunnen dit project steunen door het bestellen van een van mijn boeken (die ik zal signeren) samen met het album, zoals „Blütenessenzen in der Schwangerschaft“ en / of „Illustrierte Enzyklopädie der Blütenessenzen“.Risico’s en uitdagingenHet opnemen van het album zal ongeveer vier weken tijdens de maand van juli duren. Dit moet voldoende tijd om meer materiaal dan wordt gebruikt in het eindproduct op te nemen. Zo kunnen de beste opnamen worden geselecteerd om te worden opgenomen in het album. Uiteraard zal dit afhangen van het plannen van de piano technicus, omdat de piano moet voor elke sessie worden afgestemd, maar de gecontracteerde technicus is zeer betrouwbaar. Peters ervaring in de muziek productie heeft hem geleert om een project met succes tot in de kleinste details te plannen en uit te voeren. Terwijl onbekende factoren hebben de neiging om tijdens een project op te duiken en de voortgang te vertragen, We zijn beiden overtuigd dit project soepel zal verlopen in de aangegeven tijd.Ik ben blij om eventuele vragen of opmerkingen te beantwoorden en zal u steeds over de voortgang van het project op de hoogte houden.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

With Elites, it's easy to dial in the fine details when recording, and mixes come together much more quickly and translate flawlessly.</p><p style=""margin-left:-4.5pt;"">Some of the key ingredients that set Klawitter Designs Elite monitors apart from competing brands:</p><p><strong>Cabinets. </strong>The Acoustic Cabinet Control™ enclosure forms the foundation of the Elite sound. Constructed from multiple precision-milled layers of HDF assembled “glulam-style,” the enclosure’s curved sides and computer-designed interior surfaces virtually eliminate the nodes and problem reflections inherent in traditional straight-side cabinet designs. The Elite's multi-layer design also yields a remarkably rigid, sturdy cabinet with exceptionally low-resonance, so the sound you hear is pure and clean, uncolored by enclosure-induced artifacts.</p><p> </p><center><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/xUPGcHsYKXEIzKO4ZW/giphy.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></center><p> </p><p><br/><strong>Drivers.  </strong>Elite monitors boast custom carbon fiber/Kevlar low frequency transducers that provide extraordinarily accurate response down to an amazing 29Hz @ -1dB (!) on the 8” model and 39Hz (also @ -1dB) on the 6.5” version. These outstanding performers are paired with our custom Ultra High Definition high frequency driver, a 1” inverted dome that’s coated, using a proprietary process, with titanium nitrate. The coating process imparts not only the beautiful gold color to the driver, but dramatically lowers 2nd and 3rd order harmonic distortion to a previously unattainable level. The end result is a system that delivers unrivaled frequency response: 29Hz – 24kHz, +/-1dB on the Elite 8s and 39Hz – 24kHz, +/-1dB on the 6s. <br/> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492555913/grgb9lqfiv3eycee2bmb.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/><strong>Amplification. </strong>The biamplified KD Elites are driven by state-of-the-art Class D amplifiers that provide 500 Watts of super clean power per side (390 Watts LF / 110 Watts HF), yielding output levels of &gt;108dB RMS (&gt;113dB peak) on the 8s and &gt;106dB RMS (&gt;110dB peak) on the 6s. In other words, these monitors can play LOUD. Of course, they can play softly too, and their frequency linearity across the entire volume range will simply blow you away---low volume reproduction on the Elites is as full, punchy, and accurate as higher level playback, meaning your ears will last after long hours in the studio…day after day.</p><p><strong>192kHz DSP.</strong> System control is provided courtesy of advanced 192kHz DSP. This Ultra High Definition processing allows for exceptionally fine resolution adjustments to be made at all critical points in the system. Nowhere is this essential capability more evident than in the Elite crossover, which is managed entirely in the digital domain. Comprised of multiple sharp-sloped filters (custom-programmed by Keith), the Elite crossover eliminates the distortion and frequency loss problems inherent in traditional crossover designs, both active and passive. This UHD DSP is also used to precisely dial in system performance (equalization, driver time-alignment, etc.), ensuring that each Elite monitor performs not only to its own exacting specifications, but is also perfectly matched to other Elites in a system, from a simple stereo setup to a full-blown surround-sound array. <br/> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492560628/thximnmf2e1krt0idzon.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/> </p><p><strong>Sonic Signature.</strong> Over the past 30+ years, scores of leading producers, engineers, and artists have regularly relied on their Klawitter-designed monitors to deliver world-class results.

Klawitter revolutionized the recording arts with the introduction of his first-of-its-kind near-field monitoring system. To this day, his namesake KRK Systems speakers are the largest selling studio monitors in the world. Now, Keith and the team at his new company, Klawitter Designs, are on a trajectory to again totally disrupt the recording industry with a flagship monitor system that represents a quantum leap in the art and science of audio reproduction.Introducing the Elite 192kHz Ultra High Definition Titanium Nitrate Transducer studio reference monitors---speakers in which technical performance details such as frequency response, imaging, dynamic response, linearity, and phase coherence are so expertly dialed-in and executed that they disappear into the sound and let you just feel the music. Our first run of Elite speakers will go to backers of this campaign. After that, they'll be sold via a worldwide network of professional music and audio retailers and systems contractors/integrators, We're asking for your help in bringing Keith's innovative and convention-shattering new products to recording musicians eager to advance their art---and we're offering a bit of ""motivation"" in the form of a 33% price discount for participants in this pre-launch campaign: Save $2,000 on a pair of Elite 8s or $1,875 on a pair of Elite 6s.Click a logo to view coverage....                                                                                                    The Elite series represent the culmination of Keith Klawitter's 30+ years of industry-leading speaker design, with multiple Grammy®-award winning engineers, producers, and artists calling them “the best speakers I’ve ever heard” and regularly making comments like “I can’t mix without them!” All of our early adopters agree that adding Elites to their studio setups has greatly streamlined the production process, thanks to the substantially increased accuracy the monitors provide. With Elites, it's easy to dial in the fine details when recording, and mixes come together much more quickly and translate flawlessly.Some of the key ingredients that set Klawitter Designs Elite monitors apart from competing brands:Cabinets. The Acoustic Cabinet Control™ enclosure forms the foundation of the Elite sound. Constructed from multiple precision-milled layers of HDF assembled “glulam-style,” the enclosure’s curved sides and computer-designed interior surfaces virtually eliminate the nodes and problem reflections inherent in traditional straight-side cabinet designs. The Elite's multi-layer design also yields a remarkably rigid, sturdy cabinet with exceptionally low-resonance, so the sound you hear is pure and clean, uncolored by enclosure-induced artifacts.  Drivers.  Elite monitors boast custom carbon fiber/Kevlar low frequency transducers that provide extraordinarily accurate response down to an amazing 29Hz @ -1dB (!) on the 8” model and 39Hz (also @ -1dB) on the 6.5” version. These outstanding performers are paired with our custom Ultra High Definition high frequency driver, a 1” inverted dome that’s coated, using a proprietary process, with titanium nitrate. The coating process imparts not only the beautiful gold color to the driver, but dramatically lowers 2nd and 3rd order harmonic distortion to a previously unattainable level. The end result is a system that delivers unrivaled frequency response: 29Hz – 24kHz, +/-1dB on the Elite 8s and 39Hz – 24kHz, +/-1dB on the 6s.  Amplification. The biamplified KD Elites are driven by state-of-the-art Class D amplifiers that provide 500 Watts of super clean power per side (390 Watts LF / 110 Watts HF), yielding output levels of >108dB RMS (>113dB peak) on the 8s and >106dB RMS (>110dB peak) on the 6s. In other words, these monitors can play LOUD. Of course, they can play softly too, and their frequency linearity across the entire volume range will simply blow you away---low volume reproduction on the Elites is as full, punchy, and accurate as higher level playback, meaning your ears will last after long hours in the studio…day after day.192kHz DSP. System control is provided courtesy of advanced 192kHz DSP. This Ultra High Definition processing allows for exceptionally fine resolution adjustments to be made at all critical points in the system. Nowhere is this essential capability more evident than in the Elite crossover, which is managed entirely in the digital domain. Comprised of multiple sharp-sloped filters (custom-programmed by Keith), the Elite crossover eliminates the distortion and frequency loss problems inherent in traditional crossover designs, both active and passive. This UHD DSP is also used to precisely dial in system performance (equalization, driver time-alignment, etc.), ensuring that each Elite monitor performs not only to its own exacting specifications, but is also perfectly matched to other Elites in a system, from a simple stereo setup to a full-blown surround-sound array.   Sonic Signature. Over the past 30+ years, scores of leading producers, engineers, and artists have regularly relied on their Klawitter-designed monitors to deliver world-class results. Just ask Bob Clearmountain, Elliott Scheiner, Peter Gabriel, Stevie Wonder, Trent Reznor, Graham Nash, Taylor Swift, Allison Krause, Martina McBride, and countless others...   Klawitter Elite monitors continue this storied legacy with a true next-generation monitor designed to provide--and significantly improve upon---that relied-upon Klawitter sound. In the Elites, that legendary sound is augmented by depth, linearity, imaging, frequency response, and power handling that can only be considered revolutionary---delivering an advanced level of performance that is simply unheard of in a two-way system.In short: KD Elites deliver deliver the most accurate, inspiring, and trustworthy sound available for today's audio recording professionals.Low Frequency Driver: 6.5"" Custom CF/Kevlar sandwichHigh Frequency Driver: 1"" Custom TitaniumNitrate Inverted DomeFrequency Response: 39Hz - 24kHz, +/-1dBAmplification: KD Custom; 310W LF / 190W HFMaximum SPL (Peak): > 110dB; >106dB RMSInputs: Balanced XLR AnalogInternal DSP Resolution: 192kHzEnclosure: Custom High Density w/ Acoustic Cabinet Control™Power Supply: Universal SwitchingDimensions: 14.75"" H x 12"" W x 13"" D; 35lbs Low Frequency Driver: 8"" CustomCF/Kevlar SandwichHigh Frequency Driver: 1"" Custom TitaniumNitrate Inverted DomeFrequency Response: 29Hz - 24kHz, +/-1dBAmplification: KD Custom; 310W LF / 190W HFMaximum SPL (Peak): > 113dBPeak; >108db RMSInputs: Balanced XLR AnalogInternal DSP Resolution: 192kHzEnclosure: Custom High Density w/ Acoustic Cabinet Control™Power Supply: Universal SwitchingDimensions: 17.5"" H x 14"" W x 15"" D; 45lbs  We understand that purchasing a pair of monitors without first hearing them might require a bit of a leap of faith.

They fit under any helmet, stay comfortable, cut down the wind noise, and deliver next-level sound quality and precision. We’ve seriously prioritized making RiderBuds the smallest earphones ever.In order to make earphones that are guaranteed to work with even the tightest helmets, never dislodge, and stay comfortable, we had no other choice - we had to make earphones that would hide entirely inside the ear canal.  Size is what really differentiates RiderBuds from any other earphones.With our earphone disappearing entirely inside your ear canal, there’s nothing to come in interference with your helmet liner. This means no more dislodging, no pressure points, and no vibrations being transferred from the helmet at high speeds. Our earphones are the first ones to be able to clear even the tightest helmets out there. They will never fall out or break seal while putting your helmet on, period.  Most earphones easily break their seal with even a lightest pull on the wire. RiderBuds seal up inside your ear canal so well that it takes a far greater effort to break their strong seal compared to ordinary earphones. Ordinary in-helmet speakers that come with the popular intercom headsets have been the bane of existence for most riders who’ve tried them.The sheer logic behind how they’re supposed to work - by producing the sound outside of your ear in a high noise environment (often reaching 110dB+), while fighting through protective earplugs - is so utterly counterproductive, it might as well be a bad joke....except it has been the reality for many riders.  With RiderBuds, we’ve taken a fundamentally different approach with delivering audio into your ears. Instead of having the source of the sound outside of your ear, it’s deep inside your ear.The combination of superior noise attenuation and use of our extremely precise audio driver means one thing. Enjoy the quality and crispness of sound that’s never been experienced before on a bike. At any speed. We’ve tested every single available Balanced Armature driver on the market before deciding on the absolute best one.It wasn’t an easy process - the driver had to be small enough to fit inside the ear canal rather than outside of it like in conventional earphones.After a long and stringent selection process, we’ve decided to go with the single best driver on the market for its size, made in USA. The end result is very impressive - extremely crisp, precise audio, with a decent bass response. Studies have shown that it only takes 15 minutes of wind noise exposure at highway speeds to lose some of your hearing permanently, without wearing any protection.Wind noise is not a joke. It’s also called a “silent killer” for a reason. The hearing loss happens slowly and gradually, over long time. We don’t really notice it until it’s already too late.The damage has already been done, and it's irreversible.That’s why an adequate level of noise attenuation is absolutely key for protecting our hearing as riders.Most ordinary earphones or In-Ear Monitors don’t offer the same level of hearing protection as a set of a good industrial foam earplugs does.Thanks to our unique silicone and foam ear tips design, we were able to match the level of noise reduction normally only seen in protective earplugs.
Every rider has individual preferences. Some prefer the rock solid seal and durability of the triple-flanged high grade silicone tips, while some prefer the comfort and cushiness of memory foam tips.We’ve made the ear tips entirely replaceable, and both of them are washable. Foam tips will always degrade faster with use and washing, but that’s why we’re throwing in an extra spare set into each shipped RiderBuds unit. Replacements will be obviously also available, so you can continue on using our earphones season after season.Where most of the earphones have a hard plastic housing that digs into your ears under tight helmets, ours have a soft and rounded silicone shell. This ensures that your ear tips of choice will stay comfortable, even on those very long rides and adventures.   We know that our users will put RiderBuds through their paces.Building our earphones extremely tough was a big priority during the design process.We’ve achieved an unseen-before strength of connection between the cable and the speaker. Since RiderBuds need to be pulled by the cable every time when removing them from your ears, it’s absolutely essential that they can withstand that kind of use and abuse over a long time.No more replacing your earphones every riding season. After collecting nearly a thousand responses on our survey for the cable modules, we’ve listened and picked the riders’ absolute favorites.Here are the modules you’ve told us to make - and we’re including all of them with each shipped unit of RiderBuds!Intercom headset user? Our short cable module does the trick. No extra wires hanging around and getting all tangled up. Easily connect and disconnect your RiderBuds with your helmet already on. Using other devices? Just use one of the two longer modules - with or without the remote controller. Our uniquely over-sized volume remote controller is easily operated with all kinds of gloves. The modular cable design we've used also has another very important added feature.Imagine what could happen in a crash with the Kevlar-reinforced wires attached to earphones deeply anchored inside your ears - not a pretty picture.With RiderBuds, the wire simply disconnects at the mid-way connection point as soon as enough force is applied. It won't disconnect on its own, but will save your ears from some serious pain in an event of any sudden pull - whether it's a dismount, or any other scenario. With ordinary earphones, once you're all geared up, the cable of the earphones usually ends up being ""trapped"" between the jacket and your body.This creates a very easy opportunity for the cable to get pulled as soon as you move or twist your head - and ultimately, have the earphones dislodge or break their seal.That's all about to change now. RiderBuds are the first mass production earphones to feature a unique coiled cable section that stays around your neck area.This is the final step that guarantees your earphones will never get dislodged again. Some people have asked us why we didn't go with wireless earphones - it's 2018 after all, right?Except that Bluetooth earphones have serious challenges when used on a bike. 
 The battery has to go somewhere, which is usually around your ears, neck, or somewhere in between - not a good idea to have any bulky parts where a tight helmet meets your head. 
Once under the helmet, the quality and reliability of connection becomes an issue. 
Once the battery is dead, they're useless. (And many won't even last a whole day of riding).
(Plus, over 2,000+ surveyed riders and 1,000+ conversations say that most riders prefer the all-important advantages of wired earphones: low profile, reliability, ability to connect to their intercom.) You can have the best of both worlds with above setups:
The extreme low profile of RiderBuds - unrivaled fit and comfort under a helmet
Superior battery life and connection quality
Once battery runs out, you can still use the earphones 
 As motorcycle riders, we have a very unique set of challenges around our audio.We need:
Something that fits under our helmet and stays comfortable.

Precise and crisp sound - at any speed - whether we’re listening to music, communicating with each other, or hearing navigation commands.

Adequate hearing protection. Far too many riders develop hearing loss over their years in the saddle.

A solution that's reliable and won't start breaking up on us in the middle of a season, a commute, or - especially - a long trip.
The in-helmet speakers that come with all intercom headsets are always a big disappointment. With earplugs in, the sound is barely audible at high speed. It’s utterly counter-productive to have the speakers fight through both the wind noise, and protective earplugs. With no earplugs in, the audio is still mixed with the wind and exhaust noise.The currently available earphones don’t fit well under the helmet. They dislodge, break seal, become uncomfortable, put too much pressure on your ears, and transfer vibrations from the helmet - straight into your ear canals. They don’t offer as much hearing protection as earplugs do.

<p>Consumer electronics are hard to make. I have a lot of experience testing products like this one and it is a long, arduous process to get it right. I will be using the money from this campaign to help fund these items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Certification Testing - Those little marks and tags on all our new products we so easily overlook. The tests behind them keep us safe, and they are not free.</li>
<li>Production Readiness - Finalizing design work to make the product easier to build and ship on time.</li>
<li>Packaging - Another often overlooked hurdle and one I am not familiar with. Everybody loves that new box in the mail; it's the moment you've been waiting for and the moment for me to shine!</li>

My name is Robert, and I really like music. I have about 6 years of electrical engineering experience and I want to use that to bring you great audio for your headphones.We are not ready to break up with our headphone jacks. We are also not ready to pay hundreds of dollars for ""Hi-Fi"" systems promising the world. Quality audio does cost money, but not as much as the big manufacturers make you think.What I will do for you is handle the low level, nerdy, mundane tasks of picking DAC hardware, power supplies, suppressing noise, etc. All you have to do is snap it on and enjoy Simply Great Audio.

What You Get
This is part of the Motorola campaign to transform how smartphones are made. The idea is that you get the parts of the phone that are most important to you. I am focused on these areas:

Drive a wide range of headphones
Don't sacrifice battery life
Don't sacrifice your wallet

You also get options! I will be making two exciting and equally beautiful models

level.</p><p><b></b></p><h3><b>The Value of 'IP' has on an Industry and Business </b></h3><p></p><h3><b>
</b></h3><p>It has been well documented  'significant' Earnings 
and CAGR stories predominately come from 'ideation' and   creation of 
intellectual property (IP)  providing a ‘competitive advantage' within 
the global marketplace and thus preserving development of a 
'high-growth' and 'high-margin' business model for that particular 
business entity. </p><h3>Our Ideation</h3>
<p> Intellectual Property (IP) creation and management – has been a central part of Tattoo Audio's®
  ‘Corporate Value Creation' specifically within the current $3 billion 
 Premium Headphone market and the projected $70 billion global market 
for wearable technology in 2024, up from $14 billion in 2014. </p>

and utilization the Premium Headphone market will grow to  $8 billion   
by 2020. </p><h3>Global Collaboration</h3>

<b>Why We Chose Indiegogo</b>?</h3>
<p><b>Prior to Indiegogo</b> - the world of fund raising and bringing innovative

this world a better place! </p>

We incorporated NFC® technology into our premium headphones making it (tap-easy automatic connection) to configure its Bluetooth® connection to a ‘smart-device'. Just touch-and-go! If you hate tediously manually-pairing your headsets required for standard Bluetooth® headsets you know what we're talking about.<br/><br/>If you jump between multiple types of smart-connected-devices at different times of the 'day' and 'night, (like we do), ubiquitous NFC® touch-and-go pairing of devices is the only way to go!<br/><br/><b>Q.</b>  <b>Are Tattoo Audio® headphones Bluetooth enabled?  </b><br/></p><p><b>A. </b> Yes. All models of Tattoo Audio® premium wireless over-ear headphones are both Bluetooth® v4.0.<br/><br/><b>Q.</b>  <b>Does Tattoo Audio® headphones offer high-quality audio coding?  </b><br/></p><p><b>A.  </b>Yes. Integrated with both Tattoo Audio® premium over-ear wireless headphones TA-200 and TA-800, AAC and aptX® audio coding (audio codec compression algorithms) delivers high-quality coding wirelessly over Bluetooth®, enabling users to lose the wires without compromising on audio quality. To find out more go to: <a href=""http://www.csr.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.csr.com</a><br/><br/>We tried our very best to eliminate the lag, delay, or break in music or other audio traditionally experienced using Bluetooth by integrating high-quality coding technologies wirelessly over Bluetooth® with our premium over-ear headphones.<br/><br/><b>Q.  Does Tattoo Audio® headphones have any type of integrated intelligent sensor?</b>  <b><br/></b></p><p><b>A.  </b>Yes. <b>Set Them Down.. really!</b> And tad-a! Music and phone conversations immediately stop and Tattoo Audio's® intelligent headphones hibernate to conserve power resources.<br/><br/><b>Pick Them Back Up.. and WOW!</b> Music starts playing right where you left off and never missing a 'beat'.<br/><br/>Tattoo Audio's® 'ingeniously' integrated smart-sensor is at your command. On/Off integrated button to the ear-cups makes it quick and convenient to turn the sensor On/Off for cases when you listen to music or watch a movie lying down.<br/><br/><b>Q.  What does (tri-connection) mean?  </b><br/></p><p><b>A.  </b>'Tri-connection' means our premium over-ear headphones can be connected wirelessly to your smartphone while simultaneously being connected wirelessly to our integrated smartwatch. Android compatible smartphones can simultaneously connect to more than just one device by wireless configuration.<br/><br/>Tattoo Audio® is the World's First (tri-connected) premium headphone with integrated smartwatch. (Wow, this is ingenious!)<br/><br/><b>Q.  Are iOS devices able to connect to multiple devices simultaneously?</b>  <br/></p><p><b>A. </b> Currently No. Apple's iOS, built on CSR 8670 platform, only allows one iOS device (such as iPhone, iPad, iPod, etc...) to be simultaneously configured. (There are rumors Apple might be updating their iOS to enable multiple wireless device configuration. As soon as this update is made, iOS users will be able to experience simultaneously connecting to multiple devices by wireless connection).<br/><br/><b>Q.  How long does the battery last for the premium headphones?  </b><br/></p><p><b>A.</b>  The internal rechargeable lithium ion battery keeps our headphones going for about 15 – 16 hours typical use. <br/><br/><b>Q.  How long does it take to recharge the headphones battery? </b> <br/></p><p><b>A. </b> Typical charge time is 2-3 hours by micro-USB connection or A/C adapter included (in the Box).<br/><br/><b>Q.  Can the headphones lithium ion battery be removed for charging or replace with another?  </b><br/></p><p><b>A.</b>  No. In order for us to pass the ‘Safety Drop Test' we had to build the lithium ion battery as non-removable to our premium headphones. ‘It's a safety issue, not a technical issue'.<br/><br/><b>Q.  Are Tattoo Audio® headphones ANC enabled?  </b><br/></p><p><b>A. </b> Sorry, not the first two models. Including ANC technology will increase development costs and test-validation time frame 2-3 months. Plus, every ANC headset when QC inspected during production has to be individually hand tested one-by-one increasing unit costs above our budget.<br/><br/>If consumer demand is there, we will certainly come out with a 3rd generation headphone model specifically catering to ANC (Active-Noise Cancellation). <br/></p><p>However since ANC headsets are currently less than 10-percent of the ‘Premium' headphone market, we can only cater to the much smaller niche ANC market with later versions. We have already created Six-Generations of headphones and our IP supports more than twelve-generations, so the ANC feature will be addressed within our 'six-year product development plan'. *Remember, crawl, walk, and then run!<br/><br/><b>Q.  Are the ear-cup padding to the headphones replaceable?  </b><br/></p><p><b>A.</b>  Yes. We designed our soft memory foam ear-cup padding to be replaceable over time as the memory foam wears out.

You can listen and speak with incoming calls (wirelessly or in-line) with our premium headphones from your smartphone.<br/><br/><b>Q.  How far away from the Smartphone can I be?  </b><br/></p><p><b>A. </b> The industry predominately utilizes Bluetooth wireless protocol providing up to 10-meters (or 30-feet) range between wirelessly configured devices. As such, a person can be this far away from their smartphone while wearing and enjoying our premium over-ear wireless headphones and integrated smartwatch (simultaneously or individually).<br/><br/><b>Q.  How long does the battery last for the integrated smartwatch?  </b><br/></p><p><b>A.  </b>The internal rechargeable lithium ion battery keeps the TA-220 model smartwatch going for 1-2 days full-time use and 3-days standby. <br/></p><p>The TA-200 and TA-800 model has 3-4 days normal usage and 5-7 days standby. Yes, we realize other smartwatches provide up to 7-days standby, however they utilize a different OS, processor, e-paper screen, (not a vibrant 65k full-color screen), and battery size.<br/><br/><b>Q.  Does the integrated smartwatch display stay on all the time?  </b><br/></p><p><b>A.</b>  Yes. The display shows a watch face at all times.<br/><br/><b>Q.  </b>What type of display are you using?  <br/></p><p><b>A. </b> A vibrant 1.6” TFT, 65k (16bit) – pixels (240 x 240) touch-sensitive display.<br/><br/><b>Q.  Is the watch waterproof? </b> <br/></p><p><b>A.</b>  Yes. Our smartwatches will be Certified water resistant to IP57 standard. The same Standard as multi-billion dollar conglomerates smartwatches on the market today.<br/><br/><b>Q.  Scratchproof?  </b><br/></p><p><b>A.</b>  Our smartwatches have a scratch and shatter resistant lens with an anti-glare optical coating.<br/><br/><b>Q.  Does it use up my smartphones battery?  </b><br/></p><p><b>A.  </b>Our premium wireless headphones with integrated smartwatch are both wireless Bluetooth® devices.

Although we had to ingeniously design an integrated docking station to our premium headphones for quick and convenient (removal and storage) of the smartwatch and bands, this unique feature making it impossible to use standard belt-type watch bands found in the market (they won't fit within the incorporated docking station), we resolved this issue by offering replaceable 6-color watch band sets as an Accessory item to match your clothes, mood or even smartphone. <br/></p><p>Color 'theme' packages are being developed to 'trend' with iPhone and Android color variations and popularity. As time goes on, we will introduce a plurality of replaceable watch band sets including fashionable graffiti artwork designs in our famous 'Designers Series'.<br/><br/><b>Q.  Are Tattoo Audio® smartwatches Bluetooth enabled?  </b><br/></p><p><b>A. </b> Yes. <br/></p><ul>

</ul><p><b><b>Q.  Can TA-220 model Bluetooth v2.1 &amp; v3.0 also work with Bluetooth v4.0 or later model Android smartphones?  </b><br/></b></p><p><b><b>A. </b> </b>Yes. Absolutely. <br/></p><p>Thus far, we have tested all major brands of Android model smartphones (such as;  Samsung, HTC, Sony, LG, Huawei, and more) and Note 1, 2, and 3. <br/></p><p><b>Q.  What kind of functions can the integrated smartwatch provide?  </b><br/></p><p><b>A.</b>   Keeping you intelligently informed, on-the-fly user controls - are directly at your command from the integrated smartwatch.<br/><br/>With Voice, Vibrate and Display - Call record, answer, end, reject, dialing,  (SMS), SMS or social communications, Music, in-phase Phonebook, call logs and Search features, anti-loss, find my smartphone - and so much more faster than it takes to pull your smartphone out of your pocket or purse!<br/><br/><b>Q.  Can I speak into the integrated smartwatch for user-control-functions?  </b><br/></p><p><b>A.</b>   No. Just like market leaders, we tested and found that the sound quality for such a small speaker is not that good, (you have to actually hold the smartwatch up to your ear to listen and then hold the smartwatch to your mouth to speak). <br/></p><p>Our IP approach by integrating a premium over-ear headphone with a smartwatch is a more brilliant way of resolving device audible sound quality issues.<br/><br/><b>Q.  Can I use the premium headphones with integrated smartwatch while my smartphone is charging or in another room or while I'm outside?  </b><br/></p><p><b>A.</b>  Yes. Your smartphone can be in another room recharging or just safe in the house, while you're outside washing the car or working in the yard, freely enjoying MUSIC, reading the latest SMS and Social happenings, and even answering or making phone calls! <br/></p><p>- Try doing that with your top branded $400 to $450 Premium headphone! <br/><br/><b>Q.  Do I have to use both the premium headphones and integrated smartwatch both at the same time?  </b><br/></p><p><b>A.  </b>No. You can chose to use both the premium headphones and integrated smartwatch simultaneously or one at a time. It's really up to you. <br/></p><p>The point of inventing and developing our IP is to give you the advantages of utilizing both devices simultaneously - in keeping up with Youth Markets active lifestyles, trends and social happenings.<br/><br/><b>Q.  Do I have to use the Premium headphones wirelessly?  </b><br/></p><p><b>A.  </b>No. You can chose to use our premium over-ear headphones wirelessly or in-line to a smartphone, tabletPC, digital music player, or other smart-connected-device. It's really up to you. The point is we give you a choice, while the world does not. <br/><br/><b>Q.  I love your smartwatch, can I buy the smartwatch only?  </b><br/></p><p><b>A.</b>  Yes. As requested by Tattoo Audio's® Fans, TA-100SW model enables consumers to purchase just our 'sexy' Smartwatch on our website. Simply click on TA-100SW section of our website to place an order after our Indiegogo Campaign at <a href=""http://www.tattooaudio.com/ta-100sw.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.tattooaudio.com/ta-100sw.html</a>.<br/><br/><b>Q.  Will you ever sell your Premium Headpones only?  </b><br/></p><p><b>A.</b>  Yes. Our Country Sole Agents have significant demand generation from their distributors, dealers, wholesalers, importers and retailers to support such product introductions at a global level model is TA-800-HD.  Although the functions to our premium over-ear wireless headphones are being sold for $400 to $450 each by market leaders, our Intellectual Property, IP, does enable us to develop next-generation headphones which are actually intelligent, like us, not year-after-year producing old-school brainless in-line, wireless and (brail) control function headphones like market leaders.  <br/><br/><b>Q.  Does the smartwatch possess voice control functions? </b> <br/></p><p><b>A. </b> Sorry, but No. All technologies providing voice recognition or speech enabled navigation we tested the accuracy rate was not high enough to be confident in adding this feature with our products or Brand at this time.<br/><br/>We would rather do it right, than have critics complaining our 'Voice Control' accuracy rate is less than 80-percent as global market leaders products have experienced. (Remember, crawl, walk, and then run!)<br/><br/><b>Q.  Does your smartwatch possess integrated sensors for fitness tracker? </b><br/></p><p><b>A.</b>  No . We chose not to integrate 'sports or fitness' tracking functions such as 'accelerometer' to our initial premium wireless over-ear headphones and integrated smartwatches because;<br/><br/>• health and fitness is such a small percentage of the overall user mass-market for premium headphones and smartwatches;<br/>• higher certified water and dust resistant design is mandatory so users can jog, run or play in the rain, snow, or other extreme weather conditions;<br/>• it would be more logical to come out with a line of premium headphones with integrated smartwatch 'specifically designed' for the Health &amp; Fitness market after our patent portfolio is more fortifyed blocking inevitable competitors; and<br/>• design and development costs to introduce high-quality premium headphones with integrated smartwatch within the Health &amp; Fitness market is actually more expensive than the mass-market line. Unfortunately we're not a multi-billion dollar multinational conglomerate with an almost unlimited R&amp;D budget. Remember, crawl, walk then run!<br/><br/>The next premium headphone with integrated smartwatch for the 'Health &amp; Fitness' market is scheduled to be our next model introduced under our six-year product development plan. Careful patent mapping is required to secure our IP development processes.  <br/><br/><b>Q.  Does your smartwatch possess an integrated digital camera? </b><br/></p><p><b>A.  </b>No . We chose not to integrate a digital camera to our smartwatch device because the quality attained from smartwatches that do possess an integrated digital camera pales in comparison to the level of quality attained from a smartphone today.<br/><br/><b>Q.  Does your smartwatch possess an integrated GPS chip? </b><br/></p><p><b>A.</b>  No . We chose not to integrate a GPS chip to our smartwatch because this would drive up BOM, unit costs, and MSRP pricing that would drastically reduce volume sales for our initial models. GPS functions will be integrated into our next-generation  'Health &amp; Fitness' model scheduled to out in 2015. <br/><br/><b>Q.  What are the methods of notification for the smartwatch device? </b><br/></p><p><b>A.  </b>Audible, vibrate and full-color back-lit touch-sensitive display.</p><p><b>Q.  How do you handle developing the global markets? </b><br/></p><p><b>A.  </b>We appoint Country Sole Agents who either handle a specific Country or Region (group of countries) who are in charge of all aspects of sales, marketing, distribution, advertising, public relations and event management.</p><p><b>Q.  What Countries have already been taken?</b></p><p><b>A.  </b>United Kingdom, Germany, France, Belgium, Japan, Australia, Middle East (region), Scandinavia (region) and (in discussions) for People's Republic of China ( PRC ).<br/><br/><b>Q.  Can the integrated smartwatch provide push-notifications? </b><br/></p><p><b>A.  </b>Yes. Our TA-220, TA-200, and TA-800 models integrated smartwatch all provides push-notifications for users, however.<br/><br/><b>Compatible smartphones and OS :</b> Many Tattoo Audio® Smartwatch features require an internet connection via Bluetooth™ tethering. Tattoo Audio® TA-200 model Smartwatch requires Android 4.0+ operating system and TA-800 model Smartwatch requires Android 4.0+ or iOS® 4+ operating system.<br/><br/><b>Important :</b><br/>• Not all smartphone models allow Bluetooth™ tethering.<br/>• Not all versions of the same Operating System allow Bluetooth™ tethering.<br/>• Not all smartphone versions allow Bluetooth™ tethering.<br/>• There are at least 16 different types of the same (model) smartphone sold by region around the world.

Q.  How long does it take to recharge the headphones battery?  A.  Typical charge time is 2-3 hours by micro-USB connection or A/C adapter included (in the Box).Q.  Can the headphones lithium ion battery be removed for charging or replace with another?  A.  No. In order for us to pass the ‘Safety Drop Test' we had to build the lithium ion battery as non-removable to our premium headphones. ‘It's a safety issue, not a technical issue'.Q.  Are Tattoo Audio® headphones ANC enabled?  A.  Sorry, not the first two models. Including ANC technology will increase development costs and test-validation time frame 2-3 months. Plus, every ANC headset when QC inspected during production has to be individually hand tested one-by-one increasing unit costs above our budget.If consumer demand is there, we will certainly come out with a 3rd generation headphone model specifically catering to ANC (Active-Noise Cancellation). However since ANC headsets are currently less than 10-percent of the ‘Premium' headphone market, we can only cater to the much smaller niche ANC market with later versions. We have already created Six-Generations of headphones and our IP supports more than twelve-generations, so the ANC feature will be addressed within our 'six-year product development plan'. *Remember, crawl, walk, and then run!Q.  Are the ear-cup padding to the headphones replaceable?  A.  Yes. We designed our soft memory foam ear-cup padding to be replaceable over time as the memory foam wears out. Replacements will be made available on our global e-commerce web sites.Q.  Can Tattoo Audio® headphones be used to listen and speak with incoming Calls?  A.  Yes, absolutely. You can listen and speak with incoming calls (wirelessly or in-line) with our premium headphones from your smartphone.Q.  How far away from the Smartphone can I be?  A.  The industry predominately utilizes Bluetooth wireless protocol providing up to 10-meters (or 30-feet) range between wirelessly configured devices. As such, a person can be this far away from their smartphone while wearing and enjoying our premium over-ear wireless headphones and integrated smartwatch (simultaneously or individually).Q.  How long does the battery last for the integrated smartwatch?  A.  The internal rechargeable lithium ion battery keeps the TA-220 model smartwatch going for 1-2 days full-time use and 3-days standby. The TA-200 and TA-800 model has 3-4 days normal usage and 5-7 days standby. Yes, we realize other smartwatches provide up to 7-days standby, however they utilize a different OS, processor, e-paper screen, (not a vibrant 65k full-color screen), and battery size.Q.  Does the integrated smartwatch display stay on all the time?  A.  Yes. The display shows a watch face at all times.Q.  What type of display are you using?  A.  A vibrant 1.6” TFT, 65k (16bit) – pixels (240 x 240) touch-sensitive display.Q.  Is the watch waterproof?  A.  Yes. Our smartwatches will be Certified water resistant to IP57 standard. The same Standard as multi-billion dollar conglomerates smartwatches on the market today.Q.  Scratchproof?  A.  Our smartwatches have a scratch and shatter resistant lens with an anti-glare optical coating.Q.  Does it use up my smartphones battery?  A.  Our premium wireless headphones with integrated smartwatch are both wireless Bluetooth® devices. Yes, it does affect the battery life of your Smart phone, usually using up an extra 5-10% per day.Q.  How do I charge the smartwatch?  A.  We include (in the Box) x1 connection-pin cable for the smartwatch.Q.  How long does it take to recharge the smartwatch battery?  A.  Typical charge time is 2-3 hours.Q.  Can I replace the watch band? A.  Yes. Although we had to ingeniously design an integrated docking station to our premium headphones for quick and convenient (removal and storage) of the smartwatch and bands, this unique feature making it impossible to use standard belt-type watch bands found in the market (they won't fit within the incorporated docking station), we resolved this issue by offering replaceable 6-color watch band sets as an Accessory item to match your clothes, mood or even smartphone. Color 'theme' packages are being developed to 'trend' with iPhone and Android color variations and popularity. As time goes on, we will introduce a plurality of replaceable watch band sets including fashionable graffiti artwork designs in our famous 'Designers Series'.Q.  Are Tattoo Audio® smartwatches Bluetooth enabled?  A.  Yes. 
TA- 220 smartwatch is Bluetooth v2.1 & v3.0, 

TA-200 smartwatch is Bluetooth v4.0 and later, and 

TA-800 model smartwatch is Bluetooth® v4.0 and later.
Q.  Can TA-220 model Bluetooth v2.1 & v3.0 also work with Bluetooth v4.0 or later model Android smartphones?  A.  Yes. Absolutely. Thus far, we have tested all major brands of Android model smartphones (such as;  Samsung, HTC, Sony, LG, Huawei, and more) and Note 1, 2, and 3. Q.  What kind of functions can the integrated smartwatch provide?  A.   Keeping you intelligently informed, on-the-fly user controls - are directly at your command from the integrated smartwatch.With Voice, Vibrate and Display - Call record, answer, end, reject, dialing,  (SMS), SMS or social communications, Music, in-phase Phonebook, call logs and Search features, anti-loss, find my smartphone - and so much more faster than it takes to pull your smartphone out of your pocket or purse!Q.  Can I speak into the integrated smartwatch for user-control-functions?  A.   No. Just like market leaders, we tested and found that the sound quality for such a small speaker is not that good, (you have to actually hold the smartwatch up to your ear to listen and then hold the smartwatch to your mouth to speak). Our IP approach by integrating a premium over-ear headphone with a smartwatch is a more brilliant way of resolving device audible sound quality issues.Q.  Can I use the premium headphones with integrated smartwatch while my smartphone is charging or in another room or while I'm outside?  A.  Yes. Your smartphone can be in another room recharging or just safe in the house, while you're outside washing the car or working in the yard, freely enjoying MUSIC, reading the latest SMS and Social happenings, and even answering or making phone calls! - Try doing that with your top branded $400 to $450 Premium headphone! Q.  Do I have to use both the premium headphones and integrated smartwatch both at the same time?  A.  No. You can chose to use both the premium headphones and integrated smartwatch simultaneously or one at a time. It's really up to you. The point of inventing and developing our IP is to give you the advantages of utilizing both devices simultaneously - in keeping up with Youth Markets active lifestyles, trends and social happenings.Q.  Do I have to use the Premium headphones wirelessly?  A.  No. You can chose to use our premium over-ear headphones wirelessly or in-line to a smartphone, tabletPC, digital music player, or other smart-connected-device. It's really up to you. The point is we give you a choice, while the world does not. Q.  I love your smartwatch, can I buy the smartwatch only?  A.  Yes. As requested by Tattoo Audio's® Fans, TA-100SW model enables consumers to purchase just our 'sexy' Smartwatch on our website. Simply click on TA-100SW section of our website to place an order after our Indiegogo Campaign at http://www.tattooaudio.com/ta-100sw.html.Q.  Will you ever sell your Premium Headpones only?  A.  Yes. Our Country Sole Agents have significant demand generation from their distributors, dealers, wholesalers, importers and retailers to support such product introductions at a global level model is TA-800-HD.  Although the functions to our premium over-ear wireless headphones are being sold for $400 to $450 each by market leaders, our Intellectual Property, IP, does enable us to develop next-generation headphones which are actually intelligent, like us, not year-after-year producing old-school brainless in-line, wireless and (brail) control function headphones like market leaders.  Q.  Does the smartwatch possess voice control functions?  A.  Sorry, but No. All technologies providing voice recognition or speech enabled navigation we tested the accuracy rate was not high enough to be confident in adding this feature with our products or Brand at this time.We would rather do it right, than have critics complaining our 'Voice Control' accuracy rate is less than 80-percent as global market leaders products have experienced. (Remember, crawl, walk, and then run!)Q.  Does your smartwatch possess integrated sensors for fitness tracker? A.  No . We chose not to integrate 'sports or fitness' tracking functions such as 'accelerometer' to our initial premium wireless over-ear headphones and integrated smartwatches because;• health and fitness is such a small percentage of the overall user mass-market for premium headphones and smartwatches;• higher certified water and dust resistant design is mandatory so users can jog, run or play in the rain, snow, or other extreme weather conditions;• it would be more logical to come out with a line of premium headphones with integrated smartwatch 'specifically designed' for the Health & Fitness market after our patent portfolio is more fortifyed blocking inevitable competitors; and• design and development costs to introduce high-quality premium headphones with integrated smartwatch within the Health & Fitness market is actually more expensive than the mass-market line. Unfortunately we're not a multi-billion dollar multinational conglomerate with an almost unlimited R&D budget. Remember, crawl, walk then run!The next premium headphone with integrated smartwatch for the 'Health & Fitness' market is scheduled to be our next model introduced under our six-year product development plan. Careful patent mapping is required to secure our IP development processes.  Q.  Does your smartwatch possess an integrated digital camera? A.  No . We chose not to integrate a digital camera to our smartwatch device because the quality attained from smartwatches that do possess an integrated digital camera pales in comparison to the level of quality attained from a smartphone today.Q.  Does your smartwatch possess an integrated GPS chip? A.  No . We chose not to integrate a GPS chip to our smartwatch because this would drive up BOM, unit costs, and MSRP pricing that would drastically reduce volume sales for our initial models. GPS functions will be integrated into our next-generation  'Health & Fitness' model scheduled to out in 2015. Q.  What are the methods of notification for the smartwatch device? A.  Audible, vibrate and full-color back-lit touch-sensitive display.Q.  How do you handle developing the global markets? A.  We appoint Country Sole Agents who either handle a specific Country or Region (group of countries) who are in charge of all aspects of sales, marketing, distribution, advertising, public relations and event management.Q.  What Countries have already been taken?A.  United Kingdom, Germany, France, Belgium, Japan, Australia, Middle East (region), Scandinavia (region) and (in discussions) for People's Republic of China ( PRC ).Q.  Can the integrated smartwatch provide push-notifications? A.  Yes. Our TA-220, TA-200, and TA-800 models integrated smartwatch all provides push-notifications for users, however.Compatible smartphones and OS : Many Tattoo Audio® Smartwatch features require an internet connection via Bluetooth™ tethering. Tattoo Audio® TA-200 model Smartwatch requires Android 4.0+ operating system and TA-800 model Smartwatch requires Android 4.0+ or iOS® 4+ operating system.Important :• Not all smartphone models allow Bluetooth™ tethering.• Not all versions of the same Operating System allow Bluetooth™ tethering.• Not all smartphone versions allow Bluetooth™ tethering.• There are at least 16 different types of the same (model) smartphone sold by region around the world. Not all smartphones even of the (same) model provides actual SMS and Social message. Some provide - Notification Only.• Not all mobile network operators allow Bluetooth™ tethering.Note : Tattoo Audio® Smartwatch is not a standalone smartphone and therefore needs to connect to smartphones.",94.0,0,"1 Campaign

Opening them out in two seconds. No more wasting time over tangled wires. Undo the SPARK cord, and the wires will instantly unwind, ready for use.
 

 
All you need to do is bring your (NFC compatible) smarphone close to the SPARK NFC chip to read the data on it. This will reduce any set of repetitive actions down to one single movement.


For example, the simple motion of bringing your phone close to your NFC tag before going to sleep will set off your predefined set of actions, such as turning off the WiFi, switching the phone to silent mode, and setting your alarm for the next morning, all by itself
 


 
In a single movement, you can transform SPARK into a Smartphone stand.
The standing mode is ideal for watching films in trains or planes, for Skype videoconferences, for using your Smartphone as a clock or wake-up alarm, etc. 

 
After one year of design and development, over one hundred prototypes and one patent, we are proud to introduce the best possible accessory for your earbuds.",27.0,5,"1 Campaign

Desde entonces no he parado de soñar y trabajar para abrirme paso y sacar adelante una carrera musical independiente con todo lo que ello implica. Es así como logré grabar y publicar mi primer álbum de estudio “Amuleto” en 2018, con colaboraciones musicales de grandes amigos como Vicente García, Catalina García y Elkin Robinson.Descubrí en las canciones el poder de crear mundos y de transformarlo todo, de la compañía, la reflexión y el goce. Siento que mi música ha logrado eso en mi y en algunas personas y es por esto y por el amor profundo que tengo por ella que decidí escribir este segundo disco.I live to sing and create songs, I have dedicated myself to this for a little more than 6 years. Since then I have not stopped dreaming and working to break through and carry on an independent musical career with all that implies. This is how I managed to record and publish my first studio album ""Amuleto"" in 2018, with musical collaborations from great friends such as Vicente García, Catalina García and Elkin Robinson.I discovered in songs the power to create worlds and transform everything, company, reflection and enjoyment. I feel that my music has achieved that in me and in some people and it is because of this and the deep love I have for her that I decided to write this second album.De la necesidad de cantarle a la vida, a los lugares que amo y en los que crecí (Colombia y Latinoamèrica), nace la idea de la “Tierra de promesas”, título de la canción que le da nombre a este disco.Este álbum tiene como factor diferenciador el hecho de ser pensado, escrito, producido y soñado desde su origen con una idea y propòsito puntual: Celebrar la vida y volver a la tierra, al pàramo, al desierto, al mar, al nevado y al manglar a sembrar nuestras promesas de la mano de todos los seres que la habitan. Las canciones necesitan terrenos ferties para pelechar y esos terrenos fértiles solo se puede construir a partir de la amistad, de consolidar equipos de trabajo con propósitos comunes. Se que este disco va a ser muy especial, va a venir con muchas sorpresa que desde ya quiero compartir con ustedes!From the need to sing to life, to the places I love and where I grew up (Colombia and Latin America), the idea of the “Land of Promises” was born, the title of the song that gives this album its name.This album has as a differentiating factor the fact of being thought, written, produced and dreamed from its origin with a specific idea and purpose: Celebrate life and return to the land, the moor, the desert, the sea, the snow and the mangrove to sow our promises hand in hand with all the beings that inhabit it. Songs need fertile lands to fight and these fertile lands can only be built from friendship, from consolidating  teams with common purposes.I know this album is going to be very special, it is going to come with many surprises that I want to share with you from now on! Este proyecto está estructurado en tres etapas  de producción y financiación: La primera correspondiente a la composición, pre producción y primera parte de la producción musical, la cual realizamos entre Cali y Miami este año; la segunda que es en la que nos encontramos en estos momentos, corresponde a los arreglos musicales, colaboraciones y la segunda parte de la producción musical. Y la tercera a la pos producción, mezcla, mastering, prensa, lanzamientos y promoción. Mi objetivo es recaudar dinero para mi album cada etapa equivale a un 33.3 % aproximado del costo total del disco. Unos $12,000 USD por etapa, $40.000.000 COP. Decidí  optar por la plataforma Indiegogo por su reputación y facilidad. Allí, hemos proporcionado a nuestros colaboradores recompensas e incentivos que han sido pensados y diseñados con el propósito de  la conservación, protección y reconocimiento del la la fauna y flora Colombiana, por medio del arte hemos abrazado está causa, grandes organizaciones  como ProColombia nos acompañan en este camino y que ahora quiero que  ustedes también hagan parte de el, por esto  es muy importante para mi sus donaciones y contribuciones, estoy  buscando recursos, apoyo y tiempo prestado para ayudar a hacer realidad este sueño. ¡Ayúdame a compartir!  ¡A publicar!  ¡Espero con gran amor y gratitud tu donación!  Si tiene alguna pregunta, o si le gustaría involucrarse, no dude en contactarme directamente. Dentro de las recompensas encontraran piezas únicas que fueron creadas para esté proyecto.

After a year off we are ready to bring back the music and the mighty ol' craic with this year's theme camp venture: 'Enchanted Kingdom'. Celtic Chaos is a community of like-minded, electronic music loving, banter-filled folk, but it is also simply a group of hard working friends with Irish roots who have chosen to take on another creative project in their favorite city.</p><p>The group is headed up by Tipperary man Billy Vaughan, who will be putting in his sixteenth year at the Burning Man festival in 2017. After building a 70 foot Irish castle in 2013 and bringing it back to the playa for 2014 and 2015, the Celtic Chaos community has grown worldwide. They are a true collaboration of creative talents, with more and more of the Irish community of San Francisco and beyond getting involved every day. Electricians, painters, sound engineers, musicians, you name it have joined from all over the world.</p><p>This year Celtic Chaos are ready to show you what is beyond the castle walls and introduce you to their 'Enchanted Kingdom'. Their world of Celtic mysticism and magic will be a domain of fairy forts, a magic toadstool, a causeway and a forest of enchantment that will leave you spellbound. Of course they wouldn't be Celtic Chaos without a touch o'blarney...you can expect a mighty good session and EPIC SOUND.</p><p>As luck would have it they have been given a prime spot again (10:00 and DANCE)!!! Not only that but Celtic Chaos will be throwing down some of their best parties yet; just wait until this year’s lineup is released!  </p><p>Of course, with this epic sound comes an epic sound system, which the crew are investing heavily in this year. To assist with the additional cost of this new sound system, Celtic Chaos are hoping to crowdfund $2,500 through this page.

After a year off we are ready to bring back the music and the mighty ol' craic with this year's theme camp venture: 'Enchanted Kingdom'. Celtic Chaos is a community of like-minded, electronic music loving, banter-filled folk, but it is also simply a group of hard working friends with Irish roots who have chosen to take on another creative project in their favorite city.The group is headed up by Tipperary man Billy Vaughan, who will be putting in his sixteenth year at the Burning Man festival in 2017. After building a 70 foot Irish castle in 2013 and bringing it back to the playa for 2014 and 2015, the Celtic Chaos community has grown worldwide. They are a true collaboration of creative talents, with more and more of the Irish community of San Francisco and beyond getting involved every day. Electricians, painters, sound engineers, musicians, you name it have joined from all over the world.This year Celtic Chaos are ready to show you what is beyond the castle walls and introduce you to their 'Enchanted Kingdom'. Their world of Celtic mysticism and magic will be a domain of fairy forts, a magic toadstool, a causeway and a forest of enchantment that will leave you spellbound. Of course they wouldn't be Celtic Chaos without a touch o'blarney...you can expect a mighty good session and EPIC SOUND.As luck would have it they have been given a prime spot again (10:00 and DANCE)!!! Not only that but Celtic Chaos will be throwing down some of their best parties yet; just wait until this year’s lineup is released!  Of course, with this epic sound comes an epic sound system, which the crew are investing heavily in this year. To assist with the additional cost of this new sound system, Celtic Chaos are hoping to crowdfund $2,500 through this page. If you aren’t going to make it back to the playa this year but want to participate and be a part of the Celtic Chaos family then this is the way to do it.

With the ground-breaking ability to translate 37 languages in real-time, these earbuds are a pioneering industry first – there’s nothing out there quite like it. Mymanu CLIK will help drive collaboration and break down language barriers in new and exciting ways, allowing for comfortable travel, freedom of movement, amazing music experience and communication with everyone.           CLIK is ideal for a multitude of scenarios, whether you’re enjoying the best music on-the-go or planning an international business trip.        Music lovers: enjoy crystal-clear sound quality wherever you are in the world, and make the most of the ergonomically designed ear buds, which are gentle to the ears all day long.       Travellers: enjoy travel as it should be – with no language barriers, no phrasebooks and no apps, just real-time translations delivered directly to your ear.       Business users: conducting business internationally has never been easier. Break down those language barriers and strike up new global partnerships with CLIK at your side.       CLIK also has scope to be developed into an enterprise solution, which could revolutionise a number of industries and sectors. Imagine how international conferences and exhibitions could be revolutionised if the language barriers were totally demolished? Language is the last barrier to full globalisation and with everyone literally talking the same language potential for growth is incredible.      In the medical/ aid industry  – staff having the ability to understand and interact with those speaking another language in a time of real stress and trauma could boost patients’ peace of mind in stressful situations. The military could also make use of CLIK in a tangible way, reducing the need for translators in the field and ensuring that nothing is ‘lost in translation’ when it matters most.                  1. A stylish charging case with USB port for extra device charging2. A pair of CLIK earbuds3. Small, medium or large ear covers4. A micro USB charging cable Wireless earbuds are no new creation – but the vast majority of the existing models are riddled with problems. The sound quality is poor, many of them rely on outdated Bluetooth technology, and some of them cut out mid-call or mid-song. Put simply, the wireless earbud market needs a hero product.         Mymanu CLIK uses dynamic new technology to offer the most reliable wireless option on the market. There are no cut-outs, no over reliance on Bluetooth, and the quality of every sound, whether it’s a notification, a translation or your favourite song, is perfectly clear.          Too many wireless headphones are let down by touch pads, which confuse the users and often don’t live up to expectations. Mymanu CLIK utilises intelligent touch control, with an advanced sensor embedded into the buds themelves. All of the most common gestures and commands are supported: a single tap will play or pause your music, answer a call or check your notifications. A directional swipe will take you to the last or next track, as well as declining any incoming calls. Tapping and holding the sensor will activate the voice command feature, for simple and efficient control over the buds.          Mymanu CLIK has been designed to be highly ergonomic, so you won’t experience that telltale soreness that often comes after a day of wearing uncomfortable earbuds. You can choose from small, medium or large silicone ear tips to suit your own dimensions, and the covers make a wide contact with your ears, reducing the pressure points and ensuring a reliable, comfortable fit.Ear covers are also available in different finishes, from glossy silicone (a tighter fit, ideal for exercise or strenuous activity) to matte silicone (smooth and soft, great for everyday wear)
The stunning charging case is as much a part of the product as the buds themselves. This beautifully designed capsule case features a magnetic alignment system, which ensures that the buds are charging correctly.

The case also comes with a single USB output, so you can charge your smartphone or tablet simultaneously. CLIK works most effectively when synced with one of these devices and the charging case ensures you’ll never be without your earbuds or your mobile devices.    
         Live translation to break down language barriers.One of Clik’s most exciting features is its ability to translate different languages, with the translation delivered to the earbuds in real-time.          Whether you’re asking for directions in another country, striking a deal at an international business meeting or taking an order from a tourist at a hotel or restaurant, Clik ensures that language no longer stands in the way of efficient interaction. Interact with multiple people in different locations at one time.
CLIK uses its own patented embedded software and application to make translation possible.
User connect the CLIK translate app to the earbuds using Bluetooth® technology.
Enter a unique passcode and share it share it with the one you want to talk to.
Select out of the 30 different languages the one you want to hear in.(eg. French, Spanish, German etc)
User join you with the passcode provided and select preferred language.
Mymanu CLIK early translation prototype using external driver and mic.Translation with only one earbuds where the other hasn't got Mymanu CLIK in Arabic.          Configure your Clik so that you only hear the notifications that are important to you. When synced with your smartphone, Clik will deliver notifications like text messages and incoming calls directly to the earbuds – so there’ll be no more scrabbling around in a briefcase or backpack when you receive a notification.
 CLIK is as beautiful as it is functional. The seamless integration of all parts, from the touch panel and LED ring to the body itself, is streamlined and stylish, for a smooth fit. There is a beautiful harmony of materials and finishes combined into one unique design that exudes contemporary sophistication. All charging points are unobtrusive, so ensuring the earbuds are full of juice is simple, and won’t take up too much space.                 The team behind CLIK understand that technology users in this day and age want their devices to feel personal and individual.      That’s why CLIK comes with a multitude of customisation options which allow users to tailor their earbuds to their own style and personality. There are a variety of ear covers to choose from, with a diverse array of colours, materials and finishes – so you’ll never get your CLIK earbuds mixed up with a pal. Users can also select from 16m RBG colors thanks to the built-in patented LED ring light – so whenever you receive a notification, you’ll know exactly who it’s from by the colour you’ve chosen. These additions are part of our reach goals               In the past, when consumers came to choose their earbuds, there was a distinct compromise to be made. Those who wanted great sound quality had to sacrifice wireless abilities. Those who were desperate for truly wireless earbuds were subject to poor sound quality with unreliable connections.          CLIK ensures there’s no need to compromise. With APTX® audio codec the audio is of the highest possible quality, so whether you’re receiving a call or listening to your favourite tracks you’ll never miss a beat.     The accompanying app complements and enhances every feature of Clik effortlessly. Packed with dynamic features, the app gives users total control over their earbuds. Play Music – The Clik app syncs music files saved in the phone, allowing users to select any of their music to transmit to the earbuds with ease. Using simple gestures within the app, users can play, pause, skip and rewind for ultimate control over their music.          The app is compatible with iOS and Android smartphone devices.         – there is currently no compatibility for iPads or other tablets.          Every Kickstarter campaign needs its own stretch goals. At the moment, we’re concentrating on raising the initial funds we need for tooling and certification of CLIK, but we’re also looking to the future, with a number of possibilities for CLIK development:         If we reach £1m, we will add a halo LED light. We are also considering releasing a rose gold and gold version of the earbuds, for the seriously style-savvy.              The team at Clik understand that anything can happen in the world of tech manufacturing – that’s why we’ve set ourselves some realistic completion dates and a full schedule of when we expect production and distribution to be completed. Here’s what we’ve been up to so far…          Here’s how we expect the rest of the production process to run:  Please note that shipping to any country outside the United Kingdom, Europe, North America and Canada may be delayed or cancelled depending on the feasibility of local product approval requirements or local import regulations.

You may need to take care of them yourself when receiving the shipment.       Once we’d completed our first prototype, we were thrilled to be selected for the TNW Boost Programme, an innovative start-up.

<p><b>Q: Is it just louder?</b></p>
<p>A: Well, no. Louder is just louder.  What Aumeo provides is tailored audio. </p>
<p>Like all things biological, there are variations in everyone's hearing.  </p>
<p>Here's a typical case: Joe has a much stronger ability to perceive low tones than high tones on his left ear.  He could listen to his music at a level which is just fine for his right ear, but that means he would not be able to hear the entirety of the soundtrack (specifically the high tones) clearly with his left.</p>
<p>Without Aumeo, our friend could just jack up the volume so his left ear can hear the high tones more clearly, but at the same time he's increasing the sound level of the low tones as well, maintaining the distortion of his perceived music.  Let's not forget that his right ear (which unlike his left ear can perceive both low and high tones at the same level) is needlessly receiving louder music as well, which can lead to short-term hearing discomfort and/or long-term damage.  <br/></p>
<p>What Aumeo does is measure your unique hearing for each of your ears, and then tailor your music to provide the best, custom-fit audio experience. That way, you can hear all the frequency ranges with unprecedented clarity and enjoy music as it was intended to be heard, without having to hurt your ears.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span><b>Q: How is Aumeo different from any equalizer? Can’t I just make these audio adjustments on my own?</b></span></p>
<p>A: Aumeo is much more than an equalizer for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. Aumeo measures your left and right ears’ hearing individually and tailors your music according to each of your ear’s hearing. So far we haven’t seen a product that does that on the market aside from ours.</p>
<p>2.Our audio-tailoring technology is also verified and based on actual science and expertise of audiologists and ENT doctors. We have done trials and analyzed hearing profiles to ensure the accuracy (97%) and reliability (95%) of our technology. This is much better than if a non-audiologist were to figure out on his own how well he hears with respect to each frequency and adjusting the EQ settings on his own, particularly if he is not familiar with the field of audiology. Aumeo can save you time and effort by taking care of your ears with our proven audio-tailoring process.</p>
<p>3. Finally, Aumeo has an amplifier built-in to ensure you won’t be limited to your phone’s output capabilities, and can enjoy better, clearer audio.</p>
<p><b>Q: So if you can redistribute audio based on my hearing strengths, does that mean I can get more clarity and a better audio experience with lower total volume?</b></p>
<p>A: Exactly.  Not only do you get clearer and fuller sound, you can also enjoy this improved audio experience while preventing unnecessary volume damage to your hearing. Our clinical trial data confirms that people with normal hearing get better music appreciation and more accurate comprehension at a lower total volume.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q: Is this like what Samsung phones have with their Adapt Sound?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Yes and no. Samsung phones do have a similar hearing test, but no data on the Samsung test has been published. Aumeo’s audio-tailoring technology on the other hand has been validated through clinical trials and proven to be 97% accurate and 95% reliable.</p>
<p>Also, as far as we know Samsung’s hearing adjustments only work on voice calls and their music player, whereas Aumeo the device can be used with your phone, your computer and other audio equipment."" </p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Q: Where can I read the peer-reviewed medical papers on Aumeo's technology?</b></p>
<p>A: Our audiologists are excited to know you're interested in their work! Here are the links to the papers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22676699"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22676699"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Clinical evaluation of a computerized self-administered hearing test</a>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately we are not allowed to distribute the papers ourselves even though we authored them, since the copyright now belongs to the academic publications.  For this reason we can only provide the links to the medical journals, and there may be costs associated to viewing or downloading the papers. </p>
<p></p>
<p><span><b>Q: What's the effective frequency range of Aumeo's EQ, and how much can it amplify or attenuate at different frequencies?</b></span></p>
<p>A: Aumeo's effective frequency range is from 50Hz-20kHz, though we are measuring only 8 points from 125Hz to 12.5kHz in the hardware during calibration. The rest of the points will be ""predicted"" from the existing medical data for hearing print patterns, as we'd like to save time for the user so the test wouldn't take longer than necessary. Our amplification is around 25dB max on each of the frequencies.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q: What if I want to share Aumeo with my friends or family? Can we create multiple audio profiles?</b></p>
<p>A: Yes, you can create multiple audio profiles in our companion app and choose whichever one you want to use with Aumeo the device.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q: Do I need batteries for Aumeo?</b></p>
<p>A: No, we have a lithium battery built into our device.</p>
<p><b>Q: How long does it take for the battery to charge and can I use Aumeo while it’s charging? </b></p>
<p>A: The battery takes around 2 hours to charge, but we have taken special care that you can still use it while plugged in, and that it won’t hurt your battery life in the long run.</p>
<p><b>Q: What’s the battery life? </b></p>
<p>A: Fully charged, the device can run for about 8 hours on Bluetooth and 10 hours on jacks. The exact time may change as we may be adding new features to the device, but rest assured we’ll be making sure your on-the-go tailored audio experience will be as usable and convenient as possible.</p>
<p><b>Q: When will I get access to the companion app? </b></p>
<p>A: We’ve just submitted the latest version of the app to the App Store for Apple’s approval on June 9, so if all goes well it should be out before early July 2015. The Android app will be coming out at the same time as Apple.</p>
<p><b>Q: When will Aumeo be shipped to us?</b></p>
<p>A: We'll start production right after our campaign ends, and will start shipping out Aumeo to funders in November 2015! For more details, please see the ""Roadmap to Delivery"" section above.</p>
<p><b>Q: Will it pass-through microphone signals?</b></p>
<p>A: Yes it will.</p>
<p><b>Q: I have severe hearing loss. Will Aumeo work for me?</b></p>
<p>A: Our device can improve audio experience if you have mild to moderate hearing loss (below 70 dB), but as of right now it is not meant to be a substitute for hearing aids.</p>
<p><b>Q: What is the version of the Bluetooth component? </b></p>
<p>A: The Bluetooth component is Bluetooth 3.0 for audio transmission.</p>
<p><b>Q: Does the device support aptX codec?</b></p>
<p>A: Currently our prototype does not support the aptX codec as it costs more to produce, but since so many have been asking for it we're considering making it a stretch goal, so if we do well enough our engineers will include that capability in the final product. </p>
<p><b>Q: In terms of amplifier used, what is the headphone support in terms of ohm?</b></p>
<p>A: The built-in amp in Aumeo can do 100mW at 16 ohm.</p>
<p><b>Q: What is the signal to noise ratio in terms of dB numbers?</b></p>
<p>A: The amplifier used in Aumeo has a signal to noise ratio of 96dB.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q: If I'm listening to hi-res audio (say, 320kbps) will any of the audio quality be lost when I use Aumeo?</b></p>
<p>A: Our sampling rate is 48000 samples per second, and we are using 24 bit sampling. 320kbps is an encoding setting, which means it is of better quality than 128kbps, but the actual sampling rate and resolution may vary. Our DSP is fully capable of doing better than CD quality, so in most cases it should not affect the quality of sound. The device also has automatic gain control to avoid overpowering output.</p>
<p><b>Q: Is there a line-out for Aumeo?</b></p>
<p>A: There is no line-out for Aumeo at the moment as Aumeo is originally designed to be used with headphones. However, to avoid the double amplifications from the internal amp and the external high-end amp (which is something a lot of people have asked us about), we will be adding a setting to lower the internal amp's amplification to avoid that situation.</p>If this current crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo goes well, we may create a new version of Aumeo without the internal amplifier, and re-design some of the internal routing so it can be used with desktop speakers and separate amps. This version of Aumeo is still in the early planning stage however, as it'll require a lot of engineering and testing to ensure the audio-tailoring is accurate.</div>
<div>
<p><b>Q: All this sounds great, but why aren't you making a headphone product?</b></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">A: </span>We hear you loud and clear (because we use Aumeo)!  We may indeed have plans for that down the road.  For our debut product however we want a separate device because of the following reasons:<br/></p>
<p>1. Our core value is ""individualized hearing"" and we want it to be the focus of this product.  If we made a pair of headphones and people like it, it is very easy to be confused what contributes to the improved enjoyment - is it the foam?  The shape of the headphone?  The gold-plated phone jack?  </p>
<p>By being a separate device that integrates into your existing setup, it is clear that any improvement comes from Aumeo’s technology.</p>
<p>2. Aumeo is a friend of all things audio.  We understand that audiophiles and music lovers have their own preferred headphones, speakers, and music players. Some have taken a lot of time to set up their audio systems. By building a separate device as an ""audio companion"", we can tailor music to your ears’ unique hearing—allowing you to experience the audio as it was intended to be enjoyed—while you can continue to use your existing audio setup and components.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><span><b>Q: Why do you need it to be in hardware form? Is the software not enough?</b></span></p>
<p>A: You’ll want Aumeo the device for two reasons:</p>
<p></p>
<p><span>1. It is not possible to use our phone app to apply our tailored audio technology on anything other than the songs in your music library. The app can only modify music that iOS and Android allow us to touch, which are only the songs physically loaded onto the phone.  Our app cannot tailor audio outside of your phones library: it cannot be used with music on your iCloud, phone calls or apps like YouTube, Spotify, or Angry Birds. (That is, not unless they incorporate our tech into their end.) That is why Aumeo the device is designed to take your tailored audio experience beyond your phone's music library.  With the device, you can apply your audio profile to all audio output, whether it is from your phone, your computer, or your hifi system. </span></p>2. Some phones (most notably Android phones) simply cannot handle the boost in the app’s audio-tailoring effect. On some occasions, the powered up sound can exceed the phone’s output capabilities, leading to clipping issues and static noise. Aumeo the device has a built-in sound chip that are better than what’s in those phones PLUS a built-in amplifier, which means it can provide you with a better, more accurate tailored audio experience.<p></p>
<p><b>Q: How can I use the app for all my audio needs, like phone calls?  YouTube?  Spotify?  Angry Birds?</b></p>
<p>A: The answer is similar to the first part of the previous one:  It is not possible to use our phone app to apply our tailored audio technology on anything other than the songs in your music library. The app can only modify music that iOS and Android allow us to touch, which are only the songs physically loaded onto the phone (i.e. your phone's music library). With Aumeo, you can tailor all audio output to your ears.</p>

Why you need Aumeo


How Aumeo works


Pre-order now


















Here's what the journalists who have tried our technology have to say:

“This author has tried it, and the result was pleasantly surprising.”
Richard Lai, Engadget


“Switching between the two settings … reveals a clear difference between the unfettered and filtered audio, with the latter seeming clearer and louder.”
Ben Woods, The Next Web





Why do you need Aumeo?

Because it's a well-known fact that everybody hears differently. Like our eyes, nose, mouth and all our sensory organs, not all ears are built the same.

But your audio equipment has no way of knowing just exactly how differently you hear.


Therefore your audio equipment can't take your unique hearing into account when they deliver sound to you, and have to assume that their users have the same ""standardized"" hearing.
But that one-size-fits-all approach means music lovers whose hearing don't fit that ""standard profile"" can't hear all the music.


What does this mean?
It means that you either listen to music at a normal level and miss out on certain sounds...




...or you jack up the volume to the point where you hurt your ears.




Not only does the lack of audio-tailoring produce a distortion in the perceived music, but the hearing damage is also a grave concern for music lovers and audiophiles everywhere—especially when you consider the World Health Organization's latest findings:


Your ears are THE most important part of your audio experience. Why trade short-term listening pleasure for long-term damage? 



Aumeo corrects sound to your personal hearing sensitivity in the audio signal path from your music player to your ears. It unlocks your best hearing potential so you can hear your favorite tunes the way they were meant to be heard—in all their fullness and richness.





With Aumeo, you can tailor music to your unique audio profile. Start enjoying sound clarity for the rest of your lifetime without sacrificing your hearing.




Here's how you set up Aumeo:
Step 1: Connect your phone and any pair of earbuds or headphones to Aumeo.


Step 2: Create your unique audio profile with the companion app, AumeoPlayer (available for iOS and Android), in a quiet place.




Done! Your audio profile is now stored on Aumeo. You can now disconnect Aumeo and use it with any headphones or music player to enjoy tailored audio.




Aumeo can be used with any audio equipment as long as they can be connected with a 3.5mm jack cable.





Aumeo can also be used with music players with bluetooth capabilities.






Connect it to your computer to enjoy tailored audio with services like Spotify, Youtube or Netflix.



Hook it up to your current audio setup to hear music the way it's meant to be heard.




You can also use it with your phone to have sound tailored to your ears when you are talking with your loved ones.



With Aumeo, you can enjoy tailored audio anytime and anywhere you want.
























Back us today to enjoy music tailored to your ears! 
OUT OF STOCK


Estimated delivery date for the first batch of pre-orders (placed on or BEFORE February 12 2016) is March 2016. As is customary for crowdfunded projects we will be reaching out to you via email to finalize order details, such as shipping address and colors.



We made our third stretch goal! Thanks to everybody who funded us and referred their friends!















Our audio-tailoring technology has been winning awards since 2011, back when we were still known as ACEHearing. We were a winner of the 2014 Talent Unleashed Awards.  It was an honor to have been chosen by judges such as Sir Richard Branson and Steve Wozniak.

We have also won not one, but TWO of the Wall Street Journal Asian Innovation Awards. 








Chief inventor of Aumeo's technology Professor Andrew van Hasselt is a world-renowned figure in Otology and an Honorary Advisor at the Hong Kong Society of Audiology.  His audio-tailoring invention, created in partnership with ACEHearing and now used in Aumeo, is based on three decades of expertise and has the full support of his colleagues.





We've also been working with professionals such as DJs and sound designers, who have been giving us their feedback and insights. They love what Aumeo is able to do for their audio experience!









Our hearing mapping technology is verified by an official 100-subject clinical trial at Prince of Wales Hospital's Audiology Centre to be 97% accurate and 95% reliable (you can find the links to the journals in FAQ section).
A separate trial (currently submitted for publication) concluded that with our audio enhancement, music lovers achieve better audio comprehension and music enjoyment.
We've also been asking people who have tried Aumeo what they think. Here's a playlist of videos on what they have to say:





Our team has been working on Aumeo since 2011. During these years we have developed 6 prototypes as we fine-tune our device for the best, most accurate tailored audio experience.






It has been a long wait, but we are now confident that Aumeo is more than ready for the music lovers' discerning ears.








Everything is in place. All that we're missing right now is your help.
If you want to enjoy your favorite music with unprecedented clarity AND preserve your hearing, please back us.
Help us meet our goal so that we can start manufacturing Aumeo, and let music lovers around the world experience music tailored to their ears.
Back us and pre-order Aumeo now.





Patented technologyOne of the biggest problems crowdfunding projects face is project-killing IP issues. That's why we've already secured patents for Aumeo's technology in multiple countries such as the United States, Korea, South Africa and Taiwan.
Working prototypes
As you can see in our video and testimonials, we already have working prototypes of both Aumeo the device and its companion app, AumeoPlayer. You can be sure that when you receive Aumeo, it will perform as promised.
Hardware manufacturing expertise
To ensure that we manufacture and distribute Aumeo on time, we're on track to become Brinc Certified and partnering with the best in the business: Brinc to oversee our entire manufacturing and production process to distribution and Brinc hardware expert and advisor Conrad Lee with over two decades of experience in hardware manufacturing and product design.

Complete transparency

We love the community's involvement in our project and we love to listen. As a backer, you'll be informed of every step of our journey—from manufacturing to fulfillment—through social media, our e-newsletters, our blog and of course, our Indiegogo campaign page. And as always, feel free to ask us anything by emailing us at info@aumeoaudio.com.

















Aumeo Audio has partnered with Brinc, an IoT accelerator and fund based in Hong Kong with offices in Shenzhen and Guangzhou.

Q: Is it just louder?
A: Well, no. Louder is just louder.  What Aumeo provides is tailored audio. 
Like all things biological, there are variations in everyone's hearing.  
Here's a typical case: Joe has a much stronger ability to perceive low tones than high tones on his left ear.  He could listen to his music at a level which is just fine for his right ear, but that means he would not be able to hear the entirety of the soundtrack (specifically the high tones) clearly with his left.
Without Aumeo, our friend could just jack up the volume so his left ear can hear the high tones more clearly, but at the same time he's increasing the sound level of the low tones as well, maintaining the distortion of his perceived music.  Let's not forget that his right ear (which unlike his left ear can perceive both low and high tones at the same level) is needlessly receiving louder music as well, which can lead to short-term hearing discomfort and/or long-term damage.  
What Aumeo does is measure your unique hearing for each of your ears, and then tailor your music to provide the best, custom-fit audio experience. That way, you can hear all the frequency ranges with unprecedented clarity and enjoy music as it was intended to be heard, without having to hurt your ears.

Q: How is Aumeo different from any equalizer? Can’t I just make these audio adjustments on my own?
A: Aumeo is much more than an equalizer for the following reasons:
1. Aumeo measures your left and right ears’ hearing individually and tailors your music according to each of your ear’s hearing. So far we haven’t seen a product that does that on the market aside from ours.
2.Our audio-tailoring technology is also verified and based on actual science and expertise of audiologists and ENT doctors. We have done trials and analyzed hearing profiles to ensure the accuracy (97%) and reliability (95%) of our technology. This is much better than if a non-audiologist were to figure out on his own how well he hears with respect to each frequency and adjusting the EQ settings on his own, particularly if he is not familiar with the field of audiology. Aumeo can save you time and effort by taking care of your ears with our proven audio-tailoring process.
3. Finally, Aumeo has an amplifier built-in to ensure you won’t be limited to your phone’s output capabilities, and can enjoy better, clearer audio.
Q: So if you can redistribute audio based on my hearing strengths, does that mean I can get more clarity and a better audio experience with lower total volume?
A: Exactly.  Not only do you get clearer and fuller sound, you can also enjoy this improved audio experience while preventing unnecessary volume damage to your hearing. Our clinical trial data confirms that people with normal hearing get better music appreciation and more accurate comprehension at a lower total volume.

Q: Is this like what Samsung phones have with their Adapt Sound?

A: Yes and no. Samsung phones do have a similar hearing test, but no data on the Samsung test has been published. Aumeo’s audio-tailoring technology on the other hand has been validated through clinical trials and proven to be 97% accurate and 95% reliable.
Also, as far as we know Samsung’s hearing adjustments only work on voice calls and their music player, whereas Aumeo the device can be used with your phone, your computer and other audio equipment."" 


Q: Where can I read the peer-reviewed medical papers on Aumeo's technology?
A: Our audiologists are excited to know you're interested in their work! Here are the links to the papers:


Clinical evaluation of a computerized self-administered hearing test


J Med Automated hearing screening for preschool children


Unfortunately we are not allowed to distribute the papers ourselves even though we authored them, since the copyright now belongs to the academic publications.  For this reason we can only provide the links to the medical journals, and there may be costs associated to viewing or downloading the papers. 

Q: What's the effective frequency range of Aumeo's EQ, and how much can it amplify or attenuate at different frequencies?
A: Aumeo's effective frequency range is from 50Hz-20kHz, though we are measuring only 8 points from 125Hz to 12.5kHz in the hardware during calibration. The rest of the points will be ""predicted"" from the existing medical data for hearing print patterns, as we'd like to save time for the user so the test wouldn't take longer than necessary. Our amplification is around 25dB max on each of the frequencies.

Q: What if I want to share Aumeo with my friends or family? Can we create multiple audio profiles?
A: Yes, you can create multiple audio profiles in our companion app and choose whichever one you want to use with Aumeo the device.

Q: Do I need batteries for Aumeo?
A: No, we have a lithium battery built into our device.
Q: How long does it take for the battery to charge and can I use Aumeo while it’s charging? 
A: The battery takes around 2 hours to charge, but we have taken special care that you can still use it while plugged in, and that it won’t hurt your battery life in the long run.
Q: What’s the battery life? 
A: Fully charged, the device can run for about 8 hours on Bluetooth and 10 hours on jacks. The exact time may change as we may be adding new features to the device, but rest assured we’ll be making sure your on-the-go tailored audio experience will be as usable and convenient as possible.
Q: When will I get access to the companion app? 
A: We’ve just submitted the latest version of the app to the App Store for Apple’s approval on June 9, so if all goes well it should be out before early July 2015. The Android app will be coming out at the same time as Apple.
Q: When will Aumeo be shipped to us?
A: We'll start production right after our campaign ends, and will start shipping out Aumeo to funders in November 2015! For more details, please see the ""Roadmap to Delivery"" section above.
Q: Will it pass-through microphone signals?
A: Yes it will.
Q: I have severe hearing loss. Will Aumeo work for me?
A: Our device can improve audio experience if you have mild to moderate hearing loss (below 70 dB), but as of right now it is not meant to be a substitute for hearing aids.
Q: What is the version of the Bluetooth component? 
A: The Bluetooth component is Bluetooth 3.0 for audio transmission.
Q: Does the device support aptX codec?
A: Currently our prototype does not support the aptX codec as it costs more to produce, but since so many have been asking for it we're considering making it a stretch goal, so if we do well enough our engineers will include that capability in the final product. 
Q: In terms of amplifier used, what is the headphone support in terms of ohm?
A: The built-in amp in Aumeo can do 100mW at 16 ohm.
Q: What is the signal to noise ratio in terms of dB numbers?
A: The amplifier used in Aumeo has a signal to noise ratio of 96dB.

Q: If I'm listening to hi-res audio (say, 320kbps) will any of the audio quality be lost when I use Aumeo?
A: Our sampling rate is 48000 samples per second, and we are using 24 bit sampling. 320kbps is an encoding setting, which means it is of better quality than 128kbps, but the actual sampling rate and resolution may vary. Our DSP is fully capable of doing better than CD quality, so in most cases it should not affect the quality of sound. The device also has automatic gain control to avoid overpowering output.

A: There is no line-out for Aumeo at the moment as Aumeo is originally designed to be used with headphones. However, to avoid the double amplifications from the internal amp and the external high-end amp (which is something a lot of people have asked us about), we will be adding a setting to lower the internal amp's amplification to avoid that situation.If this current crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo goes well, we may create a new version of Aumeo without the internal amplifier, and re-design some of the internal routing so it can be used with desktop speakers and separate amps. This version of Aumeo is still in the early planning stage however, as it'll require a lot of engineering and testing to ensure the audio-tailoring is accurate.

Q: All this sounds great, but why aren't you making a headphone product?
A: We hear you loud and clear (because we use Aumeo)!  We may indeed have plans for that down the road.  For our debut product however we want a separate device because of the following reasons:
1. Our core value is ""individualized hearing"" and we want it to be the focus of this product.  If we made a pair of headphones and people like it, it is very easy to be confused what contributes to the improved enjoyment - is it the foam?  The shape of the headphone?  The gold-plated phone jack?

Q: Why do you need it to be in hardware form? Is the software not enough?
A: You’ll want Aumeo the device for two reasons:

1. It is not possible to use our phone app to apply our tailored audio technology on anything other than the songs in your music library. The app can only modify music that iOS and Android allow us to touch, which are only the songs physically loaded onto the phone.  Our app cannot tailor audio outside of your phones library: it cannot be used with music on your iCloud, phone calls or apps like YouTube, Spotify, or Angry Birds.

<p>Several musical genres are played to show how the Super Buoy performs in comparison. You should listen to the test using headphones to get the real effect. Music played from an iPhone 6S Plus via airplay. Both speakers connected via Bluetooth. Volume was set at 50%.You should know the Bose SoundLink Mini 2 retails in Australia  for AUD$290 or about USD$215. Now you can imagine what the Super Buoy Plus sounds like.</p>

<p>In July 2015 we
finished technical design for the MOKiN Soundlink, which could improve the
iPhone’s audio quality. We used DAC IC CS43L36 to convert the digital audio
from the iPhone’s lightning output. The power dissipation is lower than 1000ma
meeting Apple’s requirements. It can output audio 114-dB &amp; 24-bit/192kHz.</p>

</div></div>","MOKiN Soundlink
HiFi Digital Audio Converter  Wish you could get more out of the audio from your iPhone, we did too!  So we invented a solution for this problem with the MOKiN Soundlink.
This is a high-dynamic range/low power HiFi digital audio converter with best-in-class amplifier, which presents a 114-dB & 24-bit/192kHz quality sound bringing you a perfect listening experience.
NOTE - Normal iPhone audio output is only 16-bit/48kHZ





Sound Quality is 30% Higher w/MOKiN Soundlink!


Here is what makes our product one of a kind...



Stereo Headphone Output w/114-dB Dynamic Range

Supports 24-bit/192kHz High-Definition Audio Output
Supports Multiple Audio Formats
Headphone Load Detection of 15 or 30Ω
Headphone Insertion/Removal Detection w/WAKE
Audio Serial Port (ASP): Supports Up To 32-bit Audio Inputs Includes Bypassable SRC's
Sample Rate Support For 8 to 92kHZ
Ultra Low Power Consumption w/No Need For External Battery
Kickstand Perfect For Watching Videos

Works with iPod Touch 5th Generation, iPhone 5, iPhone 5s/5c, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPad 4th Generation, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPad Air, iPad Air 2nd Generation,
iPad Mini, iPad Mini 2nd Generation, iPad Mini 3



In July 2015 we
finished technical design for the MOKiN Soundlink, which could improve the
iPhone’s audio quality. We used DAC IC CS43L36 to convert the digital audio
from the iPhone’s lightning output. The power dissipation is lower than 1000ma
meeting Apple’s requirements. It can output audio 114-dB & 24-bit/192kHz.



From a design aspect
we wanted to focus not only on the inside of the device, but also on it’s
exterior appearance.

</div>","Your search for the perfect pair of earphones has finally come to an end! Revols are the world’s first Quick Custom-Fit Wireless Earphones that mold to the unique shape of your ears in exactly 60 seconds. The coolest part? The entire molding process is controlled by YOU using our companion app on your phone! These revolutionary earphones are designed to provide you with the perfect fit, delivering the unparalleled comfort and sound you’ve been searching for.

Compromising on nothing, Revols bring you the same comfort benefits as traditional custom-fit earphones while saving you tons of time and money!
Traditional Custom-Fit Earphones

1-month process
$1000+

Traditional approach
Involves you, an audiologist and a whole lot of patience!
Revols Custom-Fit Earphones

60-second process
$214 (Indiegogo Special)

REVOLutionary approach 
Involves you, your ears and a simple app on your phone!





































Our ears are as unique as our fingerprints and so they can’t  be satisfied by a one-size-fits-all earphone mold. The Revols proprietary shaped molding tip combines a specially formulated nanocomposite and a unique ergonomic design to achieve the desired perfect fit.









Generic (left) versus Revols custom-fit (right)


Generic Earphones
They’re either too big, too small or simply don’t fit right. This poor fit causes generic earphones to put pressure, cause pain and often fall out. 
Custom-Fit Earphones 
They’re designed just for you so they fit perfectly every time. They mold to the unique grooves of your ears, sitting comfortably and never falling out!






We’ve designed Revols to be the perfect fit for you and your lifestyle! By combining sleek aesthetics with durable materials, we’re giving you the versatility you want and need. Whether you’re going for a run, catching a flight, commuting to work or sitting at your desk, you can wear Revols anywhere, anytime.




Don't fall out





Ultimate comfort





Extra scratch, sweat & water protection





Passive noise isolation





Lightweight





Premium aesthetics







To truly deliver great earphones, we knew that the sound had to be as perfect as the fit. That’s why we’re proud to announce our partnership with Onkyo, the esteemed Japanese corporation known for over 70 years of experience in high-end audio technology. We’re working alongside their team of acoustic engineers to deliver world-class audio and craft the ultimate listening experience.













Left to right: Navi (Revols), Jason (Onkyo), Daniel (Revols)


















You’re in the driver’s seat - all you have to do is press the start button on the app to activate the molding process. In just 60 seconds, the tips will transform from their initial gel-like state to their permanently hardened, customized shape… It’s really that easy, promise!




The earphones are equipped with 8 hours of reliable playtime. But to keep you company on those long journeys abroad, we’re introducing the Revols Revive battery pack. An industry first, this battery extender simply clips on to the back of the earphone wire for an extra 6 hours of listening!




Whether you’re in the midst of a movie marathon or binge watching your favorite show - don’t let your earphones stop you! Revols allow you to charge while listening! Clip the charging cable on the back of the earphone wire and plug the usb into your computer or a charging outlet to enjoy unlimited playback!












The Revols Sports Skin adds an extra layer of protection and an extra flare of personality! Effortlessly attach the silicone skin to your Revols earphones and get a whole new look with a whole new purpose. Rain or rugged terrain can’t stop these skins from protecting your earphones against scratches, sweat and water damage.  






Why so many color options? WHY NOT!
Fashion and function have never been more in sync than with the Revols Sports Skins! Besides, who wouldn’t want to match their earphones to their running shoes?











Live in a big city? Love to exercise outdoors? Your workout regime just got a whole lot safer with the Revols Adjustable Soundscape. The mics mounted on each ear will allow you to control the amount of surrounding noise played back over your music. With this feature, not only will you hear external noise, but you’ll also know exactly which direction it’s coming from.









Reasons why you’d want to change the molding tips:


Change tip size (every pair comes with extra tips in an alternate size) 
Share your earphones with a friend
Have a separate pair for a separate purpose (ex: working out)

Because why the heck not?!







Do you like when it hangs or when it hooks? Or a little bit of both? YOU CHOOSE!
Customize how you wear the connecting wire with the Revols Rotating Bezel.





Left: 6 o'clock position - Right: 10 o'clock position





 








A compact carrying case that includes a battery and an attached USB cable. This REVOLutionary charging case combines storage and power to provide your earphones with up to two full charges on the go!
















Revols app home screen





Pair, customize and wait only 60 seconds!





Adjustable soundscape





Equalizer







Within minutes of taking them out of the box, you can have your very own pair of custom-fit earphones! In just 4 simple steps you will achieve the perfect fit and be able to enjoy revolutionary,  long lasting and more comfortable listening!




























































Molding Testing:
Perfecting our nanocomposite and optimizing our molding tip geometry.

Device Fitting:
Our ears are as unique as our fingerprints. In order to achieve the optimal design for the Revols molding tip, we underwent months of device fitting testing on ears of all shapes and sizes.


Our 2 sizes of molding tips allow everyone to enjoy earphones that fit perfectly resulting in enhanced passive noise isolation. This makes it possible for people to listen to their music at safer volume levels for extended periods of time.

<div>We are a committee dedicated to seeing that the controversial and discriminatory motorcycle only noise bylaw enacted June 9, 2010 in Edmonton is either expanded to include all forms of vehicles or repealed until it can be applied equally to all. We feel it goes against the Canadian Charter of Rights &amp; Freedoms which states clearly we have the right to be held to and protected by the same laws equally and without discrimination.<br/><br/>Why are other forms of vehicles allowed to commit the same infraction without receiving the same penalties? Why did City Council feel it was necessary to target one group of people when there were already sufficient noise laws in existence?<br/><br/>All information stated on our website is information that could be found by any person in the general public.

<p>Conventional karaoke machines are always plagued by limited song availability, restricted by CDs, DVDs, or a subscription model. More often then not, even as we are willing to put up with the extra costs and hassle, songs we want frequently aren't available. Overly complex technical components, coupled with difficulty in setting up usually is enough to put us off having a karaoke system at home.</p>
<blockquote style=""border-left:4px solid #009ccb;"">Wouldn’t it be great if you could karaoke to any song you like, whenever you feel like doing so? Moment lets you to do this, with ease.

<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Unlike conventional systems, Moment™ works any file, app, or online streaming site that your devices play, enabling you to let loose and sing your heart out.

<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">On the road to making Moment, we referenced tons of sound bars &amp; speakers currently in the market and found that most of these lack mid-bass, often heard with snares and certain types of drums - especially so at the 180 - 200hz range. Utilising hardware and software tuning, Moment represents sounds as they should be heard, for a clean, crisp audio experience.</p>

</div>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">A pair of 3.5"" drivers focuses on vocals and mid-frequency notes, while two 1"" soft dome tweeters supply the high notes (up to 20kHz). We then dedicated the 6.5"" driver in Moment's wireless subwoofer to handle all low notes, cutting off at 180hz, resulting in a deep, clean-sounding bass that you can enjoy for hours.<br/>Moment, in spite of its 16” footprint, is a sound bar with audio prowess capable of filling up an entire room.</p>

 What is Moment™?
Moment is a high-fidelity sound bar, only more versatile. This world's first compact sound bar comes with a built-in mixer, complete with a wireless microphone & subwoofer to serve your entertainment needs. Whether it's singing karaoke, listening to music, enjoying a movie at home or even gaming - Moment does it all minus the cable mess. Isn't that awesome?

True karaoke experience.

Conventional karaoke machines are always plagued by limited song availability, restricted by CDs, DVDs, or a subscription model. More often then not, even as we are willing to put up with the extra costs and hassle, songs we want frequently aren't available. Overly complex technical components, coupled with difficulty in setting up usually is enough to put us off having a karaoke system at home.
Wouldn’t it be great if you could karaoke to any song you like, whenever you feel like doing so? Moment lets you to do this, with ease.

Unlike conventional systems, Moment™ works any file, app, or online streaming site that your devices play, enabling you to let loose and sing your heart out. This means you have access to an unlimited, and always up to date karaoke song library with apps like Smule, YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music, Google Play Music, Pandora, and more.





Wireless Microphones.
Moment's wireless microphones uses dual-band UHF frequencies, you are able to switch between the bands, minimising occurrences of a signal conflict amongst other UHF products in the household, like your TV or radio receiver for example.

Designing our microphones, we made sure to be extra critical of today's microphones. That's why we designed Moment's microphone to include volume controls, so you don't have to reach for the remote control every time it's your turn to sing.
And because we are karaoke enthusiasts ourselves, we included active feedback cancellation into Moment's microphones - so you can sing a duet in harmony without fear of that irritating, high pitch feedback when 2 microphones are near each other.
No cable mess.
What do you think of when wanting to set up a sound system? Difficult, costly, messy?
Not this time. Moment™ comes with a wireless subwoofer and microphone that automatically pairs up once in range. No setup required.




Because no one likes to deal with cable mess.




Compatible with any device.
Moment™ connects to any device you have, and produces quality audio no matter the connection. The built-in AUX port as well as Optical Audio port accepts connection with your analog or digital devices. Bluetooth aptX technology provides CD-like quality audio when streaming wirelessly.

Enhanced home movies.

Utilising technology from DTS TruSurround™, we tuned Moment™ for peak performance, accurate extraction and placement of audio cues, resulting in a realistic and immersive virtual surround experience.

The post-processing and psychoacoustic techniques implemented for bass and dialog enhancement with DTS TruSurround™ provides a high frequency definition for maximum realism and clarity to complete the audio entertainment experience.


Moment™ + DTS TruSurround™ = Better sounding movies, tv shows, music & karaoke.
 


For Gamers, too.


Moment is designed to fit under most desktop monitors - it is even compact enough to sit on a stool - yet provide enough oomph for sounds and effects.

Heart-pumping bass provided by Moment's wireless subwoofer and DTS TruSurround technologies enhances your gaming experience, making sure audio cues are placed more accurately - so you can not only see, but hear and feel your enemy approaching. Never lose sight of the objectives again.

EQ personalised.
Whether you’d like to attempt those high falsetto notes, feel the explosion as the fighter jet flies by, or quietly catch up on the latest Game of Thrones episode while your baby naps.

That is why we carefully thought out 4 preset equaliser modes which should cover most moments. In case that's not enough, Moment comes with a free Moment app where you can customise your own equaliser settings to your liking.



Utilising the free Moment app on your iOS or Android device, a full spectrum equaliser lets you adjust finer things such as treble and bass, volume and even echo levels for the microphones.

Bigger size ≠ better sound.

Conceptualising Moment, one of the first realisations we had was space constraints. Moment was created with modern homes in mind, packing a true karaoke experience, DTS TruSurround technology, wireless streaming, digital and analog interfaces, all into one sleek, compact design. The result is a 16-inch footprint - space we can all afford.

Delivering clean, crisp audio.
On the road to making Moment, we referenced tons of sound bars & speakers currently in the market and found that most of these lack mid-bass, often heard with snares and certain types of drums - especially so at the 180 - 200hz range. Utilising hardware and software tuning, Moment represents sounds as they should be heard, for a clean, crisp audio experience.



A pair of 3.5"" drivers focuses on vocals and mid-frequency notes, while two 1"" soft dome tweeters supply the high notes (up to 20kHz). We then dedicated the 6.5"" driver in Moment's wireless subwoofer to handle all low notes, cutting off at 180hz, resulting in a deep, clean-sounding bass that you can enjoy for hours.Moment, in spite of its 16” footprint, is a sound bar with audio prowess capable of filling up an entire room.



Indiegogo Story.
We seeded the idea for Moment™ back in early 2014. Avid karaoke lovers ourselves, we wanted to make karaoke simple and fun - like it was intended to be - and so we set out on Project Moment™.

Conventional karaoke setups were limited by song availability, and required too many other components to work.



The project went through numerous iterations before we identified what Project Moment™ stood for: a chance to express yourself.
 Our entire team rallied behind Project Moment™ and we managed to create our first prototype earlier this year. In Summer 2015, we successfully created a fully functional prototype. Despite having the initial costs for tooling, audio tuning and hardware development covered, we still came up a little short. We now turn to the Indiegogo community's help. Help re-define karaoke, and make Moment a reality.

<p>With a successful crowdfunding of Lofree Keyboard on Indiegogo, we are confident that we can get support across the globe if we continue to make great stuff. That’s why we are launching the Poison on Kickstarter. We want to prove that a tiny speaker can pump out superior sound by improving the housing structure and sound tuning. Since this is our first time making a speaker, we faced lots of challenges, such as molding, user experience, battery consumption and acoustic tuning. Our team worked around the clock in the past few months. Finally, we have overcome all of the problems, hence our Kickstarter campaign, and mass production soon!<br/><br/> </p>

The Poison can play up to six hours of CD quality music wirelessly. Or you can instantly back the good ol’ days of radio channel surfing.It comes with Venetian Red Pure WhiteOlive GreenTurquoise Blue  Let us pay tribute to items from the past and give them new meaning today while memorizing ol’ good melodies.Lofree Poison is a blend of 1950s radio with innovative modern technology which makes for a nostalgic classic gadget a modern coating.   Designed with acoustics in mind, we engineered the Bass Enhancement System that lets the Poison produce mids and trebles from the front, while an ultra large diaphragm in the back pumps out powerful, deep, full-bodied bass.
The meticulously designed housing went through five iterations. It’s been perfected to ensure a long lasting and stable bass performance.
Does a tiny speaker mean weaker sound? No. With 20-watt amplifiers (two pieces of 10-watt amplifiers) processing audio output, the Poison sounds more vast than other speakers of similar size.We’ve engineered renowned Waves® MaxxAudio Acoustic Solution that’s built into the speaker, so it can produce richer and full-bodied sounding content. The algorithms of sound perception(including noise and music) create a perceived low bass and compensate for the acoustic limitations of tiny devices. Waves received a Technical GRAMMY® Award in recognition of its outstanding contributions to the recording industry.With a 2000mAh built-in rechargeable battery, Poison can play up to six hours of CD quality music wireless and portable. If you prefer to connect in another way, the Poison also lets you connect via the aux cable.
 
Like a fine wine that became even more valuable with age. With a physical rotating dial for channel scanning, the Poison will bring back nostalgic memories of the good ol’ days of radio channel surfing.Credit to @SuperphenblogDesign IterationA little change for a better experienceIn order to have the Poison more durable that last for years and lower defective rates in production, we’ve decided to engrave functional symbols on the device’s buttons instead of the original silk printing.We understand you may love the previous design. But after we tested three prototypes in the past few weeks, we think the latest version offers the best user experience.When you combine love and free, you get lofree. We all come from a designer's background - as reflected in our product. We dedicate ourselves to keep the most sophisticated product simple and elegant, in order to benefit and reach more people. We push boundaries in product design and have won several Red Dot and iF design awards. We love the way of life. This is lofree.
