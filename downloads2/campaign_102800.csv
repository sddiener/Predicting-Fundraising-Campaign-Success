<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>We are <a href=""http://slashie.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">slashie</a> and <a href=""http://jucarave.com/blog/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">jucarave</a> (a.k.a Slashing Dragon and Exodus Destiny Dragon from the Ultima Dragons Internet Chapter UDIC). We are two game developers who love classic RPGs and we have quite a bit of indie game development experience behind, including <a href=""http://ananiasgame.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ananias Roguelike</a> (a game available on Steam, iOS and Android with over 100.000 installs), a gamedev youtube <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/jucarave"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">channel</a> with over 1700 subscribers and many other game projects done for the past 10 years or so.</p>
<p>In the past, we have worked together in a couple of fan projects including a 3D dungeon crawler remake of Ultima 4 (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmWnIsz-wPA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Stygian Abyss</a>), and a demake of Ultima VIII into an even more classic engine. (<a href=""https://blog.slashie.net/category/my-games/morgaelin/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Morgaelin</a>) </p>
<p>For a long time, we have wanted to create a tool which allows fans from classic game franchises to bring their reconstruction and fan projects into reality. With your help this can be a reality!</p>
<p>We are planning to create an open source game engine from scratch with which you'll be able to create your own adventures. It will come packed with ready to use content based on Denzi's cc-by-sa  3.0 <a href=""https://opengameart.org/content/denzis-16x16-oblique-tilesets"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">oblique tileset</a>, so you can jump straight into map making, NPC design and scripting to develop your game. (Note that you can use your own graphics too if you want!)</p>
<p>You can see demonstrations of the engine <a href=""http://slashware.net/oax6/demos.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> (we'll be posting more as development goes onward with your contributions)</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What kind of game will you be able to create?</h3>
<p>The engine will allow you to create 2D top down RPGs using orthogonal grid maps with an hybrid real time / turn based mode (real time for normal gameplay, turn based for combat).</p>
<p>The core of the engine is inspired by the Ultima VI engine, which means you can model your game world as a continuous single scale map where all action takes place (including combat) and you will be able to engage in conversation with NPCs to obtain information and advance through the game and its plot, using plot items to resolve puzzles and uncover secrets and exploring the vast world to find surprises.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need funding for the following</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing the game engine (and potentially the Game Editor)</li>
<li>Expanding the tile set as needed</li>
<li>Creating a library of reusable pieces of content</li>
</ul>
<p>All the development (both software and art) will be released under an open license so you can use it in both free and commercial projects.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496206460/fu2eovcdhxo3g8xue2du.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Base Goal ($2.000)</strong></p>
<p>We will deliver a free, open source game engine which you can readily use for your project including a content pack (Medieval Fantasy). This version of the engine would not include any tools to manage your game data (characters, monsters, object definitions), everything would be done at code level using data files and Tiled.</p>
<p><strong>Stretch Goals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>$3.000 - Game editor including Objects and Monsters managers</li>
<li>$4.000 - Full game editor including Character and Magic System managers.</li>
<li>Beyond - each 500$ will be used to create a new themed content pack (Space, Modern, Futuristic, Western, Steampunk, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p><strong>Graphics</strong></p>
<p>Supported graphic styles include the oblique perspective characteristic of the Ultima IV engine, as well as a 3/4 front facing perspective similar to traditional jRPGs ala RPGMaker, and a full top down perspective for more symbolic, old school games similar to Ultima V.</p>
<p>The game will include two medieval fantasy art packs from Denzi: one will allow creating maps with an oblique, Ultima VI like perspective, while another one will allow creating older school looking top down games. New art packs will be released as allowed by the campaign budget.</p>
<p><strong>Music and SFX</strong></p>
<p>The engine will support situational music triggered by game events or tied to game locations, as well as sound effects for the game actions. Supported formats are MP3, OGG and WAV.</p>
<p>The engine comes bundled with a basic SFX pack. Music is left to the game developer to find for his own game.</p>
<p><strong>Other Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple characters party: You will be able to have NPCs and pets join your party, they will follow you around and you'll be able to command them in combat if needed.</li>
<li>NPC Schedules: They wake up every day to go to their jobs and come back home in the night. Schedules are customizable per NPC.</li>
<li>Day and Night cycles: Reduced visibility during the night, different enemies activity.</li>
<li>Camping: Make camp in the wilderness to recover your strength, beware being ambushed!</li>
<li>Party AI: When in battle mode, other party members can act on their own optionally, selecting a proper target for attack or running away based on general parameters.</li>
<li>Dialogs: Create an history which is unveiled by talking with NPCs, finding clues and using the information you obtain from the to travel the world.</li>
<li>Crafting: Gather elements from the world and combine them between themselves or other items to create new items. Obtain leather from dead animals and create clothing from it, bake bread (of course!), create weapons using metals in a forge, and more!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Platforms</strong></p>
<p>The games created by the engine will be accessible for desktop (Windows, Mac, Linux), mobile (Android, iOS) and also playable from modern browsers.</p>
<p><strong>Supported input modes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Keyboard: Movement will be done using the arrow keys, numpad or WASDpad.</li>
<li>Mouse and touch interfaces: Movement will be done by touching the map in the cardinal direction the player wants to move (without pathfinding). Drag and drop will be supported for inventory management.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scripting and Programming</strong></p>
<p>The engine is made on JavaScript, and in case you are going to use it directly (without the scenario creation tools), it will provide a JavaScript API which you could use from your own game's code. JavaScript is also used for scripting events and behaviors.</p>
<h3>Licensing</h3>
<p>The engine will be released under the MIT License, allowing you to use the engine for both commercial and non-commercial works, without you having to include any modifications or additional source code. All community contributions will be welcome of course.</p>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p><strong>Why make another RPG creation kit?</strong></p>
<p>We want to enable enthusiast developers to create RPGs of this particular style more easily and bring them into many platforms. Since we are seeking a particular style of games, we decided to start from scratch in order to not be bound by the limitation of existing engines.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you go for this particular style of engine?</strong></p>
<p>We feel this kind of engine strikes a good balance between a visually pleasing world while still allowing the developers to expand the content at a lower cost (for example creating new art by themselves or hiring a pixel artist). Work on 16x16 tiles on a limited color palette is much cheaper than higher res, higher color depth, (although the engine is not limited by resolution, but that's what the starter content kits will look like)</p>
<p>Also, we already have a pretty cool and complete cc-by-sa tileset available that we can use as a basis for people to create their games.</p>
<p><strong>Will I be restricted by the provided tilesets?</strong></p>
<p>No, you can add custom tilesets for your game. </p>
<h3>Engine Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Turn based movement with scrolling.</li>
<li>Keyword based dialogues with conditions and prompts.</li>
<li>Up to 6 party members with AI settings for battle and the ability to move in solo mode.</li>

As time passed, more and more members, ourselves included, expressed more and more frustration and disappointment with certain practices within our niche of the gaming community. There was a general consensus that things can be done better - that WE could do better.“We should make our own game!”What started as a passing thought in the comment section evolved into Airtight Alibi Productions LLC.We wish to create a mystery adventure game that offers a meaningful and engaging experience for our players. While also promoting a strong female character in a traditionally male-dominated role, the Amelia Darnell game will further improve the development of critical thinking skills, comprehension, and problem-solving. We intend it to be for a family audience of ages 10+.Amelia Darnell: Secrets of Silvercrest Village is the story of a recent criminal justice graduate from Michigan who has a special goal in life: to gain enough experience out in the field to become an FBI agent! As if by providence, Amelia is almost immediately granted the opportunity to chase this dream when her university test scores grabs the attention of a mysterious “mentor.” Due to his own recent promotion to head a special task force within the FBI, he insists that Amelia pick up where he left off and sends her to Silvercrest Village in the remote Henry Mountains of Utah to investigate a series of strange occurrences. Amelia soon finds herself neck-deep in a case stranger than any she could have fathomed. There are several reports of tourists suddenly vanishing from a nearby state park, Goblin Valley. In the village itself, there have been a number of recent break-ins and random acts of vandalism at Summit High School. And to top it all off, a strange, white, yeti-like creature has been repeatedly spotted wandering the village at sundown! Strange disappearances, mysterious villagers, a highly paranoid FBI contact, a secretive student, an ornery teacher, a frustrating mentor… and even a mythological monster. Just what has Amelia gotten herself into?Amelia Darnell – 21 y.o.Amelia is a recent university graduate of a criminal justice program. She is from Grand Rapids, Michigan, and aspires to become an FBI agent. Immediately upon her graduation, she is approached via phone by the mysterious “Mr. Yellow,” who somehow acquired her impressive college test scores, and is assigned her first investigation.Mr. Yellow (a.k.a.

  In SMACH Z you can install Windows 10 or Linux.
Windows 10:  With Windows you have more compatible games and programs.
Linux (SMACH Z OS): We're able to modify and adapt the OS to SMACH Z, creating a better interface and experience.
The button layout will use two haptic touch pads, a joystick (clickable), 4 action face buttons, 4 trigger buttons and 2 additional action buttons on the back.Anyone will be able to create their own custom control schemes. The touch pads are also buttons with different areas of detection, so they can be used in many ways.If you are a ""classic"" gamer, and you prefer more traditional controls, you can use the Z-Pads add-ons. They are adapters to configure the SMACH Z controls by attaching them to either touchpad.If you are a ""classic"" gamer, and you prefer more traditional controls... you can use the Z-Pads add-ons. They are adapters to configure the SMACH Z controls by attaching them to either touchpad.This simple yet magic solution will permit you to play with a real D-Pad on your SMACH Z, add a second stick or add more buttons. There are plenty of combinations!The following benchmarks have been run on the final hardware of the SMACH Z PRO: AMD Ryzen™ V1605B with Radeon™ Vega 8 graphics, running on Windows 10.

<h3>Story/Features</h3>
<p>Disgraced soldier Demetri is exiled to Secren, a dangerous world devoid of women. Earthlings are smaller and weaker than the violent men of Secren. Demetri's only hope for survival is to bond with a strong mate who can love and protect him. The heterosexual Italian-American refuses to do that. He's not a homophobe, but he won't have gay sex to survive--or will he?</p>

<p>Play as Demetri. He disobeyed an order to try to save the lives of his squadron. They died, and he ended up court martialed. He has 20 years hard labor on Secren and things he can get by without becoming someone's boyfriend. It's not like he's a homophobe, he just isn't into dudes--for now.<br/><br/>Sadly, having to bond with a man may be the least of Demetri's problems. Planet Secren is a violent and dangerous world. Things become real for him fast, and he doesn't know what he's going to do.</p>

<p>Helix (aka Maelstrom) was the only love interest in the original novel series and is the 'cannon' route here. Helix is the hero you need to survive this horrible planet. How long can you resist this charming mine-lord?</p>

<p>Jader isn't evil, he's just a victim of the horrible circumstances on his planet. When he injured his leg he couldn't mine anymore and had to join a biker gang of cannibalistic criminals. He doesn't like what he's become, and takes drugs to numb his pain. He'd become clean and walk away from it all for a guy like Demetri.</p>

<p>Zheng Li is the reason Secren is such a terrible planet. He lives in his lofty fortress above all the suffering. For him, miners are just disposable assets. He thinks it's fine for the weak ones to die. That just lets stronger miners take their place. Now that he wants Demetri he'll have to open his eyes to how horrible he let things get.</p>

Characters

Play as Demetri. He disobeyed an order to try to save the lives of his squadron. They died, and he ended up court martialed. He has 20 years hard labor on Secren and things he can get by without becoming someone's boyfriend. It's not like he's a homophobe, he just isn't into dudes--for now.Sadly, having to bond with a man may be the least of Demetri's problems. Planet Secren is a violent and dangerous world. Things become real for him fast, and he doesn't know what he's going to do.

Helix (aka Maelstrom) was the only love interest in the original novel series and is the 'cannon' route here. Helix is the hero you need to survive this horrible planet. How long can you resist this charming mine-lord?

Jader isn't evil, he's just a victim of the horrible circumstances on his planet. When he injured his leg he couldn't mine anymore and had to join a biker gang of cannibalistic criminals. He doesn't like what he's become, and takes drugs to numb his pain. He'd become clean and walk away from it all for a guy like Demetri.

Zheng Li is the reason Secren is such a terrible planet. He lives in his lofty fortress above all the suffering. For him, miners are just disposable assets. He thinks it's fine for the weak ones to die. That just lets stronger miners take their place. Now that he wants Demetri he'll have to open his eyes to how horrible he let things get.

Nönnönnöö is the someone who does everything but not necessarily as best as one can, but You are the one who has the power to affect where Nönnönnöö is headed. Will You be the best of the best who gets accepted to RUK, the Reserve Officer School, or will You throw in the towel and go home with your tail between your legs? How you survive in the Finnish Army is up to You.</p><p> </p><h3>Other characters</h3><p>In every group of conscriptees, youngsters from all walks of life are thrown in the same boat. On their first steps to adulthood, young people are handling the turmoil of finding themselves as people and figuring out the mysteries of being an adult, but first they have to survive the Finnish Army. Among the differences and similarities conflict and camaraderie spark to life. Here you can meet some of the many characters with whom you share your once-in-a-lifetime experience in the Finnish Army.</p><h3>
<br/>Jortikka - The Displeased Drama Queen</h3><p>The capital of capitals, the cream of the crop of cities in Finland, is Helsinki (at least according to the people living there themselves). Everything outside the outermost of highway rings around the capital area, is countryside full of brainless country bumpkins. People outside Helsinki see the locals as spoiled snobs though. When you meet Jortikka, you can’t help but think that there’s at least some truth to it.<br/> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1614413738/ysmeqilwjxvfcglgtxnz.jpg"" src=""""/><strong><i>“Ugh, really? Do I, like, seriously have to?”</i></strong></p><p>Jortikka is the drama queen who whines and complains about literally everything with the conscription. No time to put on makeup in the morning? Total disaster. Jewelry and fab clothes are banned? So lame. No way to actually look like a decent human being? Disgusting. Despite her negative attitude, she succeeds exceptionally in athletic exercises and often ends up ranking in the top 10 in them. However the conscription is voluntary for women, why is she even here? No one can really figure that out.<br/> </p><h3>Supela - The Merry Medic</h3><p>People from the Karelian area of Finland are seen as happy-go-lucky, jolly and friendly to all. Supela certainly has taken the happy attitude of all the people from his hometown when he joined the army to complete his civic duty.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1614413801/av6p9gmajkk8o1sag1ql.jpg"" src=""""/><strong>“Ye’ll live. Nae, on second thought let’s dress it a bit”</strong></p><p>If it’s mainly how it’s supposed to, it’s just fine for Supela. He is the medic who you wouldn’t exactly trust with your broken leg or unfortunate night-time march accident wounds, but you can’t really be mad at the guy. Although he’s half-assing his duties 99% of the time, he’s too jolly for it to be a problem and always manages to make you laugh despite the situation. He’s here just because he has to and he’s doing his job. Kind of. But there will be casualties.<br/> </p><h3>Koikkalainen - The Garrison Gossip</h3><p>There’s a saying that when a Savonian speaks, responsibility falls on the listener, and Koikkalainen is living proof of it. When he puts his wordy arsenal to use, there is no end to it and the amount is definitely more important than the quality of his stream of ramblings.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1614413750/mf2oezmtcguwvf0nro8d.jpg"" src=""""/><i><strong>“I’ve a word fer the authorities if they’ll hear me”</strong></i></p><p>The mischief-maker and biggest gossip of the garrison. A pantry thief? Scandalous relationships? Crazy conspiracies? Ghosts in the infirmary? Koikkalainen most likely started it. He makes more empty promises than there’s lakes in Finland, so you can’t trust this man with anything.<br/> </p><h3>Strandén - The Big Bad Bully</h3><p>Lahti, “the Chicago of Finland”, the city with the scientifically proven highest amount of drug residue in sewage. The harsh battle royale environment Strandén has grown up in has rubbed off on his attitude, and he is most certainly not the nicest person to be around. It’s very hard to get in his good graces, and it’s not recommended to even try if you have any amount of common sense.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1614413815/q9i5j9wrdpt0gvix5xfm.jpg"" src=""""/><i><strong>“Alright you little shits, let’s go, gimme your snus”</strong></i></p><p>A bulky guy the size of a wardrobe and with the attitude of your classic school bully: Strandén clearly thinks that high school, indeed, never ends. His numerous (and often totally unrealistic) hookup stories get frustrating after about the 11th time you hear the same story over and over again. If someone ends up “generously” getting your group some “extra training”, it’s definitely this guy. You don’t want to get on his bad side, or you’ll end up in the same category of prime bullying targets as poor Nallukka.<br/> </p><h3>Nallukka - The Pathetic Pantywaist</h3><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1614413763/fjnmalgxfk6ckfua1ty1.jpg"" src=""""/><i><strong>“Sir Lieutenant, sir, I think I pooped a little…”</strong></i></p><p>Nallukka is one of the most, if not the most, cowardly members in this batch of conscriptees. Thanks to his soft personality, general disinterest in macho man stuff and unfortunate bowel issues, he is sadly the target of frequent ridicule and bullying, especially by Strandén. Mostly he wants to get the conscription over and done with, does the absolute bare minimum and focuses on his life after this ordeal. The few things helping Nallukka get through the conscription are donuts from the canteen and his beloved plushie, Norppis.<br/> </p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1614415202/azse5bvwmrlh1ejpgua4.png"" src=""""/></h3><p>What happens in the Army, stays in the Army? Well, quite the opposite. In fact, the Army is a place of constant gossip. Rumours fly around the garrison faster than you can reassemble your trusted assault rifle. While the word of your superiors should be considered the word of God, it may be a good idea to carefully consider who you trust and who to follow.</p><p>In FAS, you’ll get to experience life in the army without the help of fact-checking sources like Wikipedia or Google.

As an added bonus, you’ll feel fresh and ready to be back wearing your uniform come Monday morning. Or, if you spent your weekend drinking with your buddies, you may find that you’ve lost some of that hard-earned discipline and the next few days things might feel a little bit harder to do. It’s all up to you to decide, how you want to spend your time inside as well as outside the garrison gates.</p><p>As well as rumours and stories told by your fellow conscripts, there is also an underlying story to follow in FAS.

By the 2000’s, this hasn’t changed in Finnish armed service. You’ll be surprised how little else has.Count how many precious days of service remain with an in-game morning comb. Other inseparable aspects of Finnish military service, such as tent stove duty, roundabout group punishment and ""intti slang"" are brought vividly to life.  Training includes conscript favorites such as NBC gear leak testing with tear gas.And fire training with napalm, as well as the ever-present cooper test. Many facets of training are included as minigames. Orienteering, combat training (taisteluammuntaharjoitus) and military drill (sulkeisjärjestysharjoitus) among them.Kilometers of Finnish country roads are modeled in luscious detail.And terrain exercises are complete with, well, terrain.As well as defensive structures for training.It is a well-known aspect of Finnish military service that the shortest service of 180 days includes approximately 300 nights sleeping in the woods. Or more often than not, spent in the woods guarding the empty forest.The barracks area is free to roam during the day, but during the night, the military police do their best to make sure anyone moving about is only doing so on actual business. That may not stop you.If you play your cards right, you may get to shoot dozens of live rounds. Dozens! Hundreds of pieces of military kit and other items, from weapons, live and simulated, to protective equipment and clothes, camping implements and packs, all the way to candy and snacks, perhaps even contraband…Kit enters the player’s inventory as it does in actual service, through regular visits to the equipment warehouse (varusvarasto). That is not to say that extra items and special equipment isn’t possible to come by.Barracks housing is modeled after the bunks, stools and steel cupboards every Finnish conscript knows and loves. Cleaning service (siivouspalvelus), folding the soldier’s blanket (pinkka) and making the bed are all in the game.The barracks grounds are complete with a soldier home (sotilaskoti), a distinctive Finnish breed of combined canteen and commissary. This is the closest you’re likely to get to civilization and normal life most evenings. The soldier home commissary offers small creature comforts such as videogames, petty gambling (slot machine, payazzo) and tasty treats.What little remnants of the outside world exists on the barracks are modeled after actual Finnish popular culture, tongue firmly in cheek. Outside events do, however, have an effect on your service, and the game has several storylines that may take several playthroughts to fully uncover.Even in the unlikely event that a Finn knows nothing else about military service, the two things they are likely to know are that the jam doughnuts in the canteen are delicious and cheap, and that the coffee is undrinkable. There are things that some conscripts cannot live without that cannot be bought in the soldier home. Tins of Swedish snus, for example, may be bought from platoon mates.Nönnönnöö - Your Average JoeIn “Finnish Army Simulator”, you play as recruit Nönnönnöö, the average Joe, the standard Sam, the textbook Tom. Nönnönnöö is the someone who does everything but not necessarily as best as one can, but You are the one who has the power to affect where Nönnönnöö is headed. Will You be the best of the best who gets accepted to RUK, the Reserve Officer School, or will You throw in the towel and go home with your tail between your legs? How you survive in the Finnish Army is up to You. Other charactersIn every group of conscriptees, youngsters from all walks of life are thrown in the same boat. On their first steps to adulthood, young people are handling the turmoil of finding themselves as people and figuring out the mysteries of being an adult, but first they have to survive the Finnish Army. Among the differences and similarities conflict and camaraderie spark to life. Here you can meet some of the many characters with whom you share your once-in-a-lifetime experience in the Finnish Army.
Jortikka - The Displeased Drama QueenThe capital of capitals, the cream of the crop of cities in Finland, is Helsinki (at least according to the people living there themselves). Everything outside the outermost of highway rings around the capital area, is countryside full of brainless country bumpkins. People outside Helsinki see the locals as spoiled snobs though. When you meet Jortikka, you can’t help but think that there’s at least some truth to it. “Ugh, really? Do I, like, seriously have to?”Jortikka is the drama queen who whines and complains about literally everything with the conscription. No time to put on makeup in the morning? Total disaster. Jewelry and fab clothes are banned? So lame. No way to actually look like a decent human being? Disgusting. Despite her negative attitude, she succeeds exceptionally in athletic exercises and often ends up ranking in the top 10 in them. However the conscription is voluntary for women, why is she even here? No one can really figure that out. Supela - The Merry MedicPeople from the Karelian area of Finland are seen as happy-go-lucky, jolly and friendly to all. Supela certainly has taken the happy attitude of all the people from his hometown when he joined the army to complete his civic duty.“Ye’ll live. Nae, on second thought let’s dress it a bit”If it’s mainly how it’s supposed to, it’s just fine for Supela. He is the medic who you wouldn’t exactly trust with your broken leg or unfortunate night-time march accident wounds, but you can’t really be mad at the guy. Although he’s half-assing his duties 99% of the time, he’s too jolly for it to be a problem and always manages to make you laugh despite the situation. He’s here just because he has to and he’s doing his job. Kind of. But there will be casualties. Koikkalainen - The Garrison GossipThere’s a saying that when a Savonian speaks, responsibility falls on the listener, and Koikkalainen is living proof of it. When he puts his wordy arsenal to use, there is no end to it and the amount is definitely more important than the quality of his stream of ramblings.“I’ve a word fer the authorities if they’ll hear me”The mischief-maker and biggest gossip of the garrison. A pantry thief? Scandalous relationships? Crazy conspiracies? Ghosts in the infirmary? Koikkalainen most likely started it. He makes more empty promises than there’s lakes in Finland, so you can’t trust this man with anything. Strandén - The Big Bad BullyLahti, “the Chicago of Finland”, the city with the scientifically proven highest amount of drug residue in sewage. The harsh battle royale environment Strandén has grown up in has rubbed off on his attitude, and he is most certainly not the nicest person to be around. It’s very hard to get in his good graces, and it’s not recommended to even try if you have any amount of common sense.“Alright you little shits, let’s go, gimme your snus”A bulky guy the size of a wardrobe and with the attitude of your classic school bully: Strandén clearly thinks that high school, indeed, never ends. His numerous (and often totally unrealistic) hookup stories get frustrating after about the 11th time you hear the same story over and over again. If someone ends up “generously” getting your group some “extra training”, it’s definitely this guy. You don’t want to get on his bad side, or you’ll end up in the same category of prime bullying targets as poor Nallukka. Nallukka - The Pathetic Pantywaist“Sir Lieutenant, sir, I think I pooped a little…”Nallukka is one of the most, if not the most, cowardly members in this batch of conscriptees. Thanks to his soft personality, general disinterest in macho man stuff and unfortunate bowel issues, he is sadly the target of frequent ridicule and bullying, especially by Strandén. Mostly he wants to get the conscription over and done with, does the absolute bare minimum and focuses on his life after this ordeal. The few things helping Nallukka get through the conscription are donuts from the canteen and his beloved plushie, Norppis. What happens in the Army, stays in the Army? Well, quite the opposite. In fact, the Army is a place of constant gossip. Rumours fly around the garrison faster than you can reassemble your trusted assault rifle. While the word of your superiors should be considered the word of God, it may be a good idea to carefully consider who you trust and who to follow.In FAS, you’ll get to experience life in the army without the help of fact-checking sources like Wikipedia or Google. Your only source of truth is a weekly news broadcast in the break area, but be careful - some of the news may affect your time inside. There is a world outside the garrison, after all, even though conscription is the main thing in your life right now.Life in the army is hard on your mental well-being, too. You may want to venture back into the real world whenever you get the chance. Going on weekend breaks can have a positive effect on your sanity and you may be even able to see the people you care so much about. As an added bonus, you’ll feel fresh and ready to be back wearing your uniform come Monday morning. Or, if you spent your weekend drinking with your buddies, you may find that you’ve lost some of that hard-earned discipline and the next few days things might feel a little bit harder to do. It’s all up to you to decide, how you want to spend your time inside as well as outside the garrison gates.As well as rumours and stories told by your fellow conscripts, there is also an underlying story to follow in FAS. Whether you manage to uncover the truth behind a conspiracy theory involving several high-ranking officers and their secrets, time will only tell… Right now, we are creating this game as a side project. Most of us in the team have a day job and can only give so much of our free time to build this project. Even though we are really passionate about completing this game, by doing it on our spare time, the completion of the game will take longer. By funding us, you would be helping us be able to spend more time on the project and give our utmost dedication to it.

<p>After the <a href=""https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/10/30/the-developer-of-retro-rpg-skald-says-he-doesnt-care-if-it-makes-money/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rock Paper Shotgun interview</a>, SKALD is getting a lot of attention. I’m getting daily requests from people who want to know how they can support the project and if it’s still possible to get their hands on a physical edition of the game.</p>
<p>This is fantastic and I would love to swell the already awesome community even more!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Adding more funding will also allow me to take more time off of my full-time dayjob. This means that the game will be much more polished at release and that post release features (such as modding support) will arrive much sooner!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>With any project there is always a risk of the project failing to complete or severely under-performing. For SKALD the biggest risk stems from this being a solo-project. As a result, if something happens to me, there is nobody to fill my shoes and finish the project.</p>
<p>That being said, during the entire development process, I have adopted a stance of risk aversion.</p>
<p>The game is developed on Unity 3D: A leading and well established game development tool. Unity 3D is well supported in terms of having a large community and a robust technical support system. There is also every reason to believe that Unity 3D will remain supported in the future.</p>
<p>Furthermore, an advantage to developing a retro-style game is that mechanics and graphics are considerably easier to produce for small teams. I keep a very strict line on avoiding feature creep, and the graphical constraints limit bloating on the production of art assets.</p>
<p>The same can be said for backer rewards: the focus is on keeping the (physical) rewards limited and easy to handle. My goal is, first and foremost, to bring you the actual game!</p>
<p>Finally, development on SKALD: Against the Black Priory is already well under way and I maintain a playable build at all times. The project has successfully undergone a semi-open alpha and moves into beta-testing in early 2020. </p>

Thank you for joining us, and please read on!<br/><br/>You may have seen this page and thought, “Wasn’t Sun Haven fully funded and THEN some?” Well, you’re correct! Our Kickstarter campaign was a resounding success thanks to the generosity of our amazing supporters. We reached almost 200% of our goal at an unbelievable $85,440!<br/><br/>Here’s a list of everything we have been able to do so far with our increased funding:</p><ul>
<li>Bring FOUR new faces into the Pixel Sprout Studios family</li>
<li>Add the Elven world Nel’Vari into the game</li>
<li>Create space for TONS of additional quests and NPCs</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>And while we were ecstatic with reaching this level of support, tons of people in our discord community were still hoping we’d reach that one last stretch goal. Now that our community is calling for it, we can’t help but answer!<br/><br/>That’s right folks, we’re talking about MOUNTS!<br/><br/>So many people wanted mounts in the game that our Director Bruce changed his mind on not including them. We were originally just using magic for quick movement around the world. But, due to so many player requests, we’re now looking to use both magic and mounts. Funnily enough, Bruce actually keeps a counter to track how many times the word “mount” is brought up in our Discord! Just take a look at our Mount Count™ below.<br/> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606889156/etqsb4sp3jkybn63z8q3.png"" src=""""/><br/> </p><p>This campaign is our response to the community. The fans wanted it, so we chose to go the route of Indiegogo InDemand. Consider it an extension of the Kickstarter campaign, or basically just “finishing up” our Kickstarter campaign here on Indiegogo. The sole goal here is to get mounts into the game. But while we’re here, we may as well use this platform to show you what we’ve been up to in the meantime! </p><p>If you saw our Kickstarter campaign, much of what lies ahead will be familiar - but not everything!

Frankly, Sun Haven has seen better days. Traffic through town has been low lately due to rumors of monsters on the road. The citizens of Sun Haven have stayed afloat so far, but nobody has been able to return the city to its former glory – and this is where you come in.</p><p>While working to revive the town, you can be whoever you want to be. Try your hand at farming, mining, fishing, fighting as a warrior, or honing your magic power as a mage. The decision is entirely yours. Your skills will grow with whatever you choose, whether you’re raising crops and animals, engaging in RPG-style questlines, or even pursuing romantic relationships. And your skills only get stronger as you level up!</p><p>In your exploration, you may find yourself in the forests outside of Sun Haven. As you delve deeper into these woods, there's a change to the energy in the air. You swear you heard the trees whispering around you, but that can't be, unless...  you've found the entrance to the enchanted city of Nel'Vari! Take time to convene with the forest, learn about the Elves, and you might be deemed worthy of entry.</p><p>It seems like no matter where you go, though, one thing remains the same – dark rumors of monsters. You know that somewhere nearby Sun Haven is the monster city of Withergate. Rumors are that strange creatures have been flocking to this city. Could this be why people are staying off the roads lately? An urgent request befalls you, and now you must decide if you will heed the rumors or seek the truth yourself…</p><p>But in all your adventuring, don't forget to take a break and gather your strength! There is always time between quests to relax and nurture your farm. Take some time to engage with your new community. Maybe you can even get a meal with the dashing doctor on the other side of town!<br/><br/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606189371/qklak8ibhc9vyemt736x.png"" src=""""/></p><p><br/>Sun Haven’s <strong>level</strong> <strong>progression system</strong> has taken shape in the form of an <strong>RPG-style skill/talent tree</strong>. As your skills grow on your adventures, you will receive points to invest in yourself however you see fit. You choose where to focus your growth, what your <strong>specialty </strong>will be, and what kind of adventurer you will become.</p><p>That’s enough just talking about skills, go ahead and take a look at some of the skills you can invest in below!<br/> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Farming</strong></p><p>Farming in Sun Haven is unlike farming in any other game. As lovers of farming sim games, we're committed to delivering a charming and refreshing new take on the genre. </p><p>On release, we expect to ship with around 50 kinds of crops including the classics like corn, potatoes, and the like. But Sun Haven is a fantasy game as much as a farming game after all, so we’re going beyond the classics with some added specialties that will bring the spice back to an age-old gameplay staple like farming. Here are some of our current design concepts we think you'll enjoy (or remember from the video!): <br/> </p><ul></ul><p><strong>A Few Crop Designs:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Gem Seed Crop:</strong> Plant a gem seed that produces gems later (so you don't have to accidentally fall in cave lava for the second time this week!)</li>
<li>
<strong>Snappy Crop:</strong> Plant seeds that jump up and down when planted and watered (they're alive!). When they fully grow, they occasionally snap at players passing by</li>
<li>
<strong>Forest Nut Crop:</strong> Passively attracts more forest wildlife like deer to your farm! Deer would drop antlers for you to use in crafting! </li>
<li>
<strong>Magic Acorn Crop:</strong> Passively attracts more squirrels to hang out on your farm. Squirrels would drop nuts or other collectibles for you!</li>

Animal lovers will have lots of options for their fantasy ranch, too. There are plenty of animals to raise in your barn - including some unconventional choices such as monster animals from Withergate and magical, exotic creatures from Nel’Vari!<br/> </p><p><strong>Potential Withergate Farm Animals:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Silk Moth:</strong> Drops silk, which is used to make cloth</li>
<li>
<strong>Gem Frog:</strong> Grows and drops gems</li>

We want mining to be a relaxing way to discover hidden treasures and unique items to bring back to your farm.</p><p>In open-world games, it’s important to add more than just space to explore, but also a variety of environments to keep you interested. We’re investing in this idea, even when it comes to our mines.</p><p>Mines and underground caverns are a great place to improve art and aesthetic (not to mention lore!). So, we’re treating it the same way we would treat any other environment. To hit that adventuresome vibe, we’re making unique underground rivers, wild plant life, magma flows, and shiny gems all specially stylized to this aesthetic. The only thing you won’t find in the mines is a player bed!<br/> </p><p><strong>Mining Summary:</strong></p><ul>

The sanctuary is curated by Pete, Sun Haven’s veteran fisherman and Lighthouse operator. You'll collect rare fish from Sun Haven, Withergate, and Nel’Vari to help Pete with his goal of completing the sanctuary. And don’t forget to lend Pete your ear as he recounts tales from the sea.

You retire for the night as well… until you’re awoken by a voice in the dark.</p><p>Who could that be?</p><p>A mysterious energy manifests in your home and leads you to a wishing well not far from town.

But first, a little history…</p><p>In the beginning, dragons dominated the land and people stayed hidden in the dark corners of the world. Because of their tiny presence - and because they hid themselves from the dangers of the world - people went unnoticed by the dragons for many years. However, there came a time when people and dragons were brought together by circumstance. </p><p>A Human village tucked inside a forest was discovered by a dragon during a raging firestorm - a storm that the dragon itself caused. Realizing that the little Humans would not survive the storm, this dragon shielded them under its wing out of mercy. </p><p>It wasn’t known by the Humans then, but most dragons are not naturally malicious. In actuality, they are considerate and intelligent beings. </p><p>Soon after that event, dragons realized that their immense power was endangering vulnerable civilizations of people and they took pity on them. At that, there was a turning point. Dragons decided to help people thrive and took on noble roles as guardians of cities and villages all over the world. In doing so, dragons established a peaceful era to the benefit of all living beings. The virtuous dragons have upheld this service for thousands of years, and continue it to this day.</p><p>Elios is the guardian of Sun Haven. He claims the title of Sun Dragon and vigilantly protects the town from his vantage point on Dragon's Meet. The journey to Dragon's Meet is a dangerous ascent crawling with monsters, but if you can brave the trek to his mountainous refuge then you will have earned Elios's blessing. A blessing like that means different things for different people - what will it mean for you?</p><p>By his presence alone, Elios brings goodwill to Sun Haven. The magical energy surrounding him is enough to bring growth to crops, health to animals, and clean flowing waters. However, it is when the Sun Dragon bestows his blessing to an individual person that we see the true effect of a dragon's magic. By imprinting his magical energy on someone, Elios unlocks the true abilities hidden in that person’s soul. In this same way, Elios gives you your first magical spell.</p><p>Elios senses something ancient and mysterious in you, a power somehow familiar to him and yet unlike anything seen in a human before. Will you join Elios on Dragon's Meet to earn his blessing and unlock your fortune?</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/8866xLNQl8CK3jtPrW/source.gif"" src=""""/>  <i>Elios the Sun Dragon - Guardian of Sun Haven</i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606189477/fxaei8qw4nc994esvxbg.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Let me tell you about the Elven city of Nel'Vari…</p><p>Nel'Vari is an Elven town hidden in the deep forests west of Sun Haven.

It's Bruce, the Director for Sun Haven writing this section!<br/><br/>For the last year, I've paid for everything out of pocket by saving up where I could over the last few years. With a bit of hard work and some extra hours each week, I am neatly and indefinitely able to staff a core functioning team to complete this project. <br/><br/><strong>So, to be clear: Sun Haven WILL release IN MAY. Period.</strong><br/><br/><strong>In terms of funding support at this point, increased support means we will reliably be able to deliver on all these gems, sparkles, and scope of the game in time.</strong><br/><br/>Currently, we’ve already finished our last hiring spree (picking up FOUR new sprouts in the studio!) and I believe we’ve done this right on track for the development curve of completing Sun Haven on time. As both a director and a player dying to play a new farming sim with my friends, I would much rather a studio hire an extra person or two ahead of time to make sure the game comes out great, and on time-- so that’s exactly what we’ve done.</p><p><br/>While we CAN eventually ship a full scoped Sun Haven over time, I think what’s best for players is getting the chance to play the full scoped game right at release.<br/>(If you're gonna put magic, dragons, fantasy, quests, and two worlds into a farming sim... you can't just go halfway, right?)</p><p><br/>The dev side of things for us right now (outside of marketing) is pushing to flesh out our Alpha versions as fast as we can-- As such, I would say this game will be shippable by the end of this month, December. In terms of early access, we probably won't do early access because we really want the game to have its full vision when players first get their hands on it. I'd hate to come off as developers that aren't thoughtful in execution just because we didn’t allow ourselves enough time to polish a beta version of the game we’d later throw away.<br/><br/>Our 14 person team needs community support to make Sun Haven the fantastic game at the scope that includes everything that we (and players) have been wanting. And to make this game at the scope that's going to fully satisfy the farming sim AND the RPG elements, we're going to need to make enough quests, items, and thoughtfully immersive settings for the combat and worldbuilding. Please help us make our dream game the absolute best it can be!<br/><br/>In terms of actual financial breakdown, the allocation of funds received by our <i>very attractive</i> backers would look like this:</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><br/><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1604641148/wuknlk9xf7afb7kjbcdx.png"" src=""""/><br/>Where Funds will be allocated!</i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><br/> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607037005/nnvtoglio47back7syfu.png"" src=""""/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1604641262/u77g2d3tfea7w0luzopi.png"" src=""""/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1604641282/cfszwmvsdpfqc24fntzr.png"" src=""""/><br/> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Thanks so much for your support!</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>- The Pixel Sprout Studios Team</strong></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>SOCIALS</strong></p><p><strong>Our Site: </strong><a href=""https://pixelsproutstudios.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://pixelsproutstudios.com/</a></p><p><strong>Patreon</strong>: <a href=""https://www.patreon.com/SunHaven"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.patreon.com/SunHaven</a></p><p><strong>Discord:</strong> <a href=""http://discord.gg/BqTCygE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://discord.gg/BqTCygE</a></p><p><strong>Twitter:</strong> <a href=""https://twitter.com/SunHavenRPG"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://twitter.com/SunHavenRPG</a></p><p><strong>Instagram:</strong> <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sunhavenrpg/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.instagram.com/sunhavenrpg/</a></p><p><strong>Facebook:</strong><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=108956407514643&amp;ref=br_rs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1089564...</a></p><p><strong>Tumblr:</strong> <a href=""https://sunhavenrpg.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://sunhavenrpg.tumblr.com/</a></p><p><strong>Pinterest</strong>:<a href=""https://www.pinterest.com/SunHavenRPG/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.pinterest.com/SunHavenRPG/</a></p><p> </p><p>Questions about this project? Check out the FAQ here, on the discord, or read more on the website!</p></div>","Farm Sims just got more magical!Make yourself at home in Sun Haven, the monster city Withergate, and - now thanks to Kickstarter - the elven town Nel'Vari!Magic is the best watering can!There's something strange about those cows...      The Wishing Well!--- Elios, The Sun Dragon! Pet Baby Dragon Reward! --- Pet Baby Tiger Reward!     Phoebe likes pie!  --- Catherine, too! Sun Haven Town Center!  ---  Withergate City! Multiplayer Farming (Elf, Dog Amari)!  ---  Elios Statue in Sun Haven!       These dummies sure had it coming?! --- Naga Player going to buy some s-s-seeds.                                                                   Iris and Vaan, 2 elven romance options3 more of the 16 romanceable characters, as featured in the video!Player customizations for days.   Release Platforms: PC/Mac Intended Platforms: Switch/Mobile Number of Players: (1-8) Release Date: May 2021 Primary Languages: EnglishDescriptors: Farming Sim, RPG, Life Sim, Dating Sim, Magic, Relaxing, Open World, Character Customization, Online Multiplayer Welcome friends, old and new! Before biting into the meat of this page, we wanted to offer a little perspective and explain what’s new. Thank you for joining us, and please read on!You may have seen this page and thought, “Wasn’t Sun Haven fully funded and THEN some?” Well, you’re correct! Our Kickstarter campaign was a resounding success thanks to the generosity of our amazing supporters. We reached almost 200% of our goal at an unbelievable $85,440!Here’s a list of everything we have been able to do so far with our increased funding:
Bring FOUR new faces into the Pixel Sprout Studios family
Add the Elven world Nel’Vari into the game
Create space for TONS of additional quests and NPCs
 And while we were ecstatic with reaching this level of support, tons of people in our discord community were still hoping we’d reach that one last stretch goal. Now that our community is calling for it, we can’t help but answer!That’s right folks, we’re talking about MOUNTS!So many people wanted mounts in the game that our Director Bruce changed his mind on not including them. We were originally just using magic for quick movement around the world. But, due to so many player requests, we’re now looking to use both magic and mounts. Funnily enough, Bruce actually keeps a counter to track how many times the word “mount” is brought up in our Discord! Just take a look at our Mount Count™ below.  This campaign is our response to the community. The fans wanted it, so we chose to go the route of Indiegogo InDemand. Consider it an extension of the Kickstarter campaign, or basically just “finishing up” our Kickstarter campaign here on Indiegogo. The sole goal here is to get mounts into the game. But while we’re here, we may as well use this platform to show you what we’ve been up to in the meantime! If you saw our Kickstarter campaign, much of what lies ahead will be familiar - but not everything! We’ve sprinkled our newest assets and concepts throughout the page, so get scrolling and take a gander at the goods!  Withergate Mounts Concept Art.  Withergate Mask Reward! Pet Baby Dragon Reward!   ---  Pet Baby Tiger Reward!  Exclusive Sparkling Sun Dress!   ---   Exclusive Sparkling Sun Armor! Greetings, Adventurer! Welcome to Sun Haven, a trading town in the height of its prosperity! … Well, it used to be. Frankly, Sun Haven has seen better days. Traffic through town has been low lately due to rumors of monsters on the road. The citizens of Sun Haven have stayed afloat so far, but nobody has been able to return the city to its former glory – and this is where you come in.While working to revive the town, you can be whoever you want to be. Try your hand at farming, mining, fishing, fighting as a warrior, or honing your magic power as a mage. The decision is entirely yours. Your skills will grow with whatever you choose, whether you’re raising crops and animals, engaging in RPG-style questlines, or even pursuing romantic relationships. And your skills only get stronger as you level up!In your exploration, you may find yourself in the forests outside of Sun Haven. As you delve deeper into these woods, there's a change to the energy in the air. You swear you heard the trees whispering around you, but that can't be, unless...  you've found the entrance to the enchanted city of Nel'Vari! Take time to convene with the forest, learn about the Elves, and you might be deemed worthy of entry.It seems like no matter where you go, though, one thing remains the same – dark rumors of monsters. You know that somewhere nearby Sun Haven is the monster city of Withergate. Rumors are that strange creatures have been flocking to this city. Could this be why people are staying off the roads lately? An urgent request befalls you, and now you must decide if you will heed the rumors or seek the truth yourself…But in all your adventuring, don't forget to take a break and gather your strength! There is always time between quests to relax and nurture your farm. Take some time to engage with your new community. Maybe you can even get a meal with the dashing doctor on the other side of town!Sun Haven’s level progression system has taken shape in the form of an RPG-style skill/talent tree. As your skills grow on your adventures, you will receive points to invest in yourself however you see fit. You choose where to focus your growth, what your specialty will be, and what kind of adventurer you will become.That’s enough just talking about skills, go ahead and take a look at some of the skills you can invest in below!  FarmingFarming in Sun Haven is unlike farming in any other game. As lovers of farming sim games, we're committed to delivering a charming and refreshing new take on the genre. On release, we expect to ship with around 50 kinds of crops including the classics like corn, potatoes, and the like. But Sun Haven is a fantasy game as much as a farming game after all, so we’re going beyond the classics with some added specialties that will bring the spice back to an age-old gameplay staple like farming. Here are some of our current design concepts we think you'll enjoy (or remember from the video!):  A Few Crop Designs:

Gem Seed Crop: Plant a gem seed that produces gems later (so you don't have to accidentally fall in cave lava for the second time this week!)

Snappy Crop: Plant seeds that jump up and down when planted and watered (they're alive!). When they fully grow, they occasionally snap at players passing by

Forest Nut Crop: Passively attracts more forest wildlife like deer to your farm! Deer would drop antlers for you to use in crafting! 

Magic Acorn Crop: Passively attracts more squirrels to hang out on your farm. Squirrels would drop nuts or other collectibles for you!
Watch out for the Jumping Seeds... you never know what might sprout!If you prefer ranching to farming, don’t worry! Animal lovers will have lots of options for their fantasy ranch, too. There are plenty of animals to raise in your barn - including some unconventional choices such as monster animals from Withergate and magical, exotic creatures from Nel’Vari! Potential Withergate Farm Animals:

Silk Moth: Drops silk, which is used to make cloth

Gem Frog: Grows and drops gems

Mimic Treasure Chest: Drops one random item from the game everyday

Baby Griffon: Produces griffon eggs and feathers

Loyal Werewolf: Fetches a random crafting item every once in a while
Farming Summary:
A multitude of crops including monster crops from Withergate
Fertilizers to boost your farm’s output
Farming spells to speed things up even more
Upgradable farm
Barn for your farm animal family
 Some crops taste good and some crops taste YOU!​All that hard work paid off!Can you find all four animals in this pen?  MiningMining in Sun Haven has a sense of adventure, progress, and accomplishment. We want mining to be a relaxing way to discover hidden treasures and unique items to bring back to your farm.In open-world games, it’s important to add more than just space to explore, but also a variety of environments to keep you interested. We’re investing in this idea, even when it comes to our mines.Mines and underground caverns are a great place to improve art and aesthetic (not to mention lore!). So, we’re treating it the same way we would treat any other environment. To hit that adventuresome vibe, we’re making unique underground rivers, wild plant life, magma flows, and shiny gems all specially stylized to this aesthetic. The only thing you won’t find in the mines is a player bed! Mining Summary:
Multiple mines throughout the world to explore 
Gems and ores to use in smithing your next armor set (yes, the gems too!)
Mining spells to optimize your trips
Minecarts to help you get into the mines
       Gems (so sparkly)!  --- Mining made easy with magic.Your ""home office""! FishingA Croc's got to eat! Fishing in Sun Haven feels like a relaxing and light challenge. The “hook” is that you never know what you're going to catch next! We currently have over 44 fish available in fishable oceans, rivers, and lakes. To give you a better idea, check out the highlight reel:
Pufferfish
Popeyed Goldfish
Hooked Bottle (contains letters, lore, or quests)
Sharks
Ribbon Eel
Golden Trash Boot! 
While we're still building it, we also plan on having a ""museum"" type system just for fishing. We call it the Fishing Sanctuary, an aquarium for you to keep your fishy friends safe. The sanctuary is curated by Pete, Sun Haven’s veteran fisherman and Lighthouse operator. You'll collect rare fish from Sun Haven, Withergate, and Nel’Vari to help Pete with his goal of completing the sanctuary. And don’t forget to lend Pete your ear as he recounts tales from the sea. With over 30 years of sailing and storytelling under his belt, they’re sure to be good! One fish down, DOZENS to go!The sea is full of surprises - like golden boots and bottled messages!Fishing Summary:
Rivers, ponds, lakes, oceans, even tropical islands to fish from
Use fish for cooking or to add to your personal collection
Catch each type of fish to earn special rewards
 CookingCooking in Sun Haven feels cozy, warm, novel, and selfless. We want players to relish in their cooking no matter what’s on the menu. There is a community aspect to cooking in Sun Haven. This approach is managed through the “Leftovers” feature.When crafting certain meals, there will be a chance to get an EXTRA meal (non-consumable by the player who made them). This meal is gift-able to NPCs and other players in the game, which will either give your friend a nice boost for their adventure or help you make some fast (and full) friends in town! Cooking Summary:
48 different recipes and counting
Save leftovers for neighbors and allies
Grow ingredients for use in cooking or buy them from the shop
Give meals as gifts to impress your neighbors and increase relationships
Bring meals on your adventures to give you a boost in times of need
 What's for lunch? Fish and rice! The Chef's Hat doesn't make you a better cook, but it sure feels like it does.Someone say.... Leftovers??  CombatCombat in Sun Haven melds challenge, skill, and fluidity. Farming sim games in the past have generally come with the price tag of stiff movement. Sun Haven is bringing elements from platformer games to make character inputs smoother - especially during combat. In our game, you'll be able to jump, dash midair, and attack all at the same time. This means that if you optimize correctly, you should be able to move while attacking almost constantly. Just watch out when using those heavy two handed swords!The depth of weapons, armor, and spells is sure to suit your playstyle no matter what it is. Ranged combat, melee combat, and magical combat are all very viable paths to keep the cutting edge over your foes. Level up! Sun Haven’s monster compendium will have you itching to reach those upper levels of combat. In terms of monster diversity, we're working through 30-50 enemy concepts that will be placed all throughout the world for you to face. Because of the flexibility Sun Haven’s setting provides, we’re able to really go outside the box here. Between the monster town, Elven town, and medieval Human town, there’s plenty of room for enemies of all kinds.The main storyline includes 3 planned story bosses to defeat. Outside of those bosses, there are roaming bosses throughout the world that might be encountered at any time! So make sure to pick up every item you can get along your journey - you never know when you might need it… Combat Summary:
Melee combat (swords, two-handed swords, flails, axes)
Ranged combat (with crossbows!)
Magic combat (spells including fireballs and chain lightning!)
An array of armor to buy or smith yourself
A range of monsters depending on your terrain
Legendary boss monsters
Zap 'em with the Chain Lighting Spell! Watch out for the leaves, they're.... dangerously cute?Legendary heroes need legendary armor!RomanceRomance in Sun Haven feels dynamic and interactive. As you grow deeper roots into your community, your relationships will develop naturally as with anyone in life – we're talking about real friendship here!Dynamic dialogue options will affect how your neighbors get along with you. Be an attentive conversationalist to make fast friends!With 16 romance-able NPCs including 10 Humans, 4 Demons, and 2 Elves, you’re bound to find your match somewhere. Seek your partner out by talking to people in town and getting to know them all individually, then take them on dates to see if you really click. And when the time comes, you can take your partnership to the next level. Get married and live with your perfect match – regardless of gender!Our romance system is something we’re giving a lot of attention to. By the time we release Sun Haven in May, we expect to have over 1000 pages of character dialogue. This content is how your connections will blossom just as they would in real life - by engaging with people on a personal level.  Bonus: if you’re both wearing your wedding rings then you will get this cute heart effect when you pass by each other! Phoebe likes pie!  ---  Catherine, too! Romance Summary:
16 Romance-able NPCs - including Elven and Demon options!
Dialogue-based reward system - earn quests and gifts by interacting with your neighbors
Dynamic conversation - paying the right compliment will land you in someone's good graces, but saying the wrong thing could get you the cold shoulder
Build complex relationships - gifts and small talk will only get you so far here; genuinely engaging in conversation is the best way to fan the flames of romance
Date system - choose a date spot and play your cards right to make some major progress on your relationships
Marry your real life partner in game! 
Oh and before we move along too quickly, we want to showcase a couple new characters we were unable to unveil in our previous Kickstarter campaign. Grab your inhalers and paper bags, people, it’s time to meet our Elven heartthrobs - Iris and Vaan!    IrisIris is an Elven enchanter in Nel’Vari. Nature is central to her work, experimenting and discovering things about how nature and magic interact. Proudly independent, she values weighing options and making a choice of her own.  VaanVaan is an Elven air mage living by his own moral code. He indulges his free-spirit by spending time in the wind above the trees, trusting emotion to guide him. Elusive and whimsical, he feels he doesn’t really belong to any society. Don't be late to meet your date!16 romanceable characters. Just three of the eligible heartthrobs in our game! The Center of Sun Haven Town! You’ve just arrived in Sun Haven, your new home. After your arrival, you receive a warm welcome in the tavern by the townsfolk. A lively evening ends with Sun Haven’s Archmage - a powerful fire mage named Lucia - lighting your way home before calling it a night. You retire for the night as well… until you’re awoken by a voice in the dark.Who could that be?A mysterious energy manifests in your home and leads you to a wishing well not far from town. The well pulses with a potent magic and you feel a vibrant energy building within yourself.What is this strange power?It isn’t until you make the journey to Dragon’s Meet that you get some clarity. There rests the Sun Dragon Elios, guardian and protector of Sun Haven. Elios senses an ancient power inside you, but it’s up to you to hone your abilities and unlock your magical potential - the fortune of Sun Haven may depend on it.Will you answer the Sun Dragon’s call?Your journey through Sun Haven’s story will put your abilities to the test. Use your wits to solve puzzles and unlock new worlds. When facing powerful story bosses, you may conquer them through combat or negotiate a peaceful solution. Secret treasures are just waiting to be discovered by anyone willing to dive deep into lore and myth. By scouring the vast world, you can find rare resources to be repurposed into powerful gear for your next quest. Most importantly, learn to harness the inherent power within yourself and battle the mysterious darkness spreading across the land.But every hero needs a home, after all. By immersing yourself in Sun Haven’s warm fellowship, you’ll see that strength can also be found in community. As a farmer, you have the chance to boost Sun Haven’s prosperity with your own sweat. The crops and animals you raise will benefit Sun Haven’s growth and your crafted goods may even bring new trade to town. All the while, your home becomes more your own with every hand-picked decoration you choose. Once your place is fully furnished, why not finally invite that shy baker over for a meal?Adventure belongs to the bold, and community to the noble. In Sun Haven, you will have both!    All right adventurer, it's time you met Elios. But first, a little history…In the beginning, dragons dominated the land and people stayed hidden in the dark corners of the world. Because of their tiny presence - and because they hid themselves from the dangers of the world - people went unnoticed by the dragons for many years. However, there came a time when people and dragons were brought together by circumstance. A Human village tucked inside a forest was discovered by a dragon during a raging firestorm - a storm that the dragon itself caused. Realizing that the little Humans would not survive the storm, this dragon shielded them under its wing out of mercy. It wasn’t known by the Humans then, but most dragons are not naturally malicious. In actuality, they are considerate and intelligent beings. Soon after that event, dragons realized that their immense power was endangering vulnerable civilizations of people and they took pity on them. At that, there was a turning point. Dragons decided to help people thrive and took on noble roles as guardians of cities and villages all over the world. In doing so, dragons established a peaceful era to the benefit of all living beings. The virtuous dragons have upheld this service for thousands of years, and continue it to this day.Elios is the guardian of Sun Haven. He claims the title of Sun Dragon and vigilantly protects the town from his vantage point on Dragon's Meet. The journey to Dragon's Meet is a dangerous ascent crawling with monsters, but if you can brave the trek to his mountainous refuge then you will have earned Elios's blessing. A blessing like that means different things for different people - what will it mean for you?By his presence alone, Elios brings goodwill to Sun Haven. The magical energy surrounding him is enough to bring growth to crops, health to animals, and clean flowing waters. However, it is when the Sun Dragon bestows his blessing to an individual person that we see the true effect of a dragon's magic. By imprinting his magical energy on someone, Elios unlocks the true abilities hidden in that person’s soul. In this same way, Elios gives you your first magical spell.Elios senses something ancient and mysterious in you, a power somehow familiar to him and yet unlike anything seen in a human before. Will you join Elios on Dragon's Meet to earn his blessing and unlock your fortune?   Elios the Sun Dragon - Guardian of Sun Haven   Let me tell you about the Elven city of Nel'Vari…Nel'Vari is an Elven town hidden in the deep forests west of Sun Haven. This enigmatic place is guarded by a secret puzzle that will test your knowledge of Elven culture. Only those familiar with Elven society can find entry, that way the Elves keep out anyone seeking to disrespect their way of life.The Elves have based their lifestyle heavily on the natural world. Eternally grateful and reverent to the power of nature, they build their structures among the plants and animals instead of clearing forests for their homes. The guardian dragon of the Elven town is Nivara. Her deep connection to the natural world makes her a wise and valuable resource for the Elves of Nel’Vari, who have based their entire existence around her teachings regarding the energy that connects all life.Nel'Vari is also home to unique forms of magic and crafting. Elven mages work with magic to discover the secrets of nature. Their research fuels Elven culture and society, keeping them in harmony with the ecosystem that gives them life. This balance sustains the forest from which they take their resources so the forest may thrive alongside Elven society. Elves are also master artisans and use nature’s resources to craft the finest woodworks. Elven woodworking is regarded as the highest quality craftsmanship in the world.What can you learn from the Elves? Will you humble yourself to Nivara’s teachings? Can you solve the puzzle and earn your entry into the enchanted city of Nel'Vari?  Nel'Vari  Early Concept Art.                   Vaan's House!  ---  Iris's House! Nel'Vari Grand Tree Concept Art.    When the sky stays dark, you can be sure you've reached the rumored monster town of Withergate! Compared to many towns, Withergate is a more technologically advanced city. It is home to a diverse population of monsters and unique creatures who have pooled their knowledge and talents together to thrive. Here, you can discover more concentrated magic, purchase monster crop seeds, or even try your hand at romance with a Lycan or two.Withergate is a world where individuals of all shapes and sizes decided to work together. Here, bookkeepers at the library are tall Cyclops (who else can grab books from the top shelf for you?), the local tailor is a silk spinning spider, and the local haberdasher has three heads for modeling his wears! Withergate's seamstress and  haberdasher! The City of Darkness is ruled by the fierce Demon King, a figure known even to the fearful Humans in Sun Haven. The royal bloodline has been in power for generations - which is a very long time for Demons! Upon entry, you’re brought to face this powerful Demon in his throne room. Let’s hope you stay on his good side...Make no mistake, Withergate is our big bet in trying to revamp the farming sim genre. By leaving the lights off, we’re able to really show off some magic and glowing effects that wouldn’t look the same in the daylight. This also allows us to support some special members in our cast who prefer the night life (see our Spectral Knight and Ghost Girl characters in the video!). Additionally, Withergate will be home to a monster carnival with games and attractions for all the creatures of the night! Your new buddy awaits you in the pet shop! Donovan, Spectral Knight, and the Ghost Girl livin' that night life! A lovely night for a stroll through the spooky forest.   A fun game is a game with variety. Sun Haven’s customization offers a ton of variety with over 20 skin colors and dozens of eye combinations for your original character’s creation. There are plenty of other options for each of the 7 playable races with no restrictions based on gender!As an Angel, you'll mix and match your halos to your wings until you've found the perfect pair. Demons of course have plenty of tails and horns to choose from. Not to mention the in-depth customization offered by the Amari race – from birds, dogs, lizards, and aquatic animal parts at your disposal, you're certain to find a combination that suits you. By the time we're done, you'll have no problem creating your unique aesthetic. Just be yourself! Race options galore! Rest assured, we've got you covered with customization outside of character building as well. Your home can be upgraded up to 3 tiers to give you plenty of room to stretch out. By the time we're finished with development, there will be hundreds of decorative items to choose from. Furthermore, we aren't restricting furniture placement by snapping it to floor tiles. Instead, the decoration is done with free placement so you can really dial it in when setting up your home base.Free placement makes decorating a snap. Furthermore, if we hit our stretch goals then both Withergate and Nel’Vari will include space for a home and farm of your very own. That’s right, you can party it up every night in Withergate, the City of Darkness! Or if you’re really trying to cleanse yourself of negative energies these days, you might find balance between your life and all life around you by immersing yourself in the Elven culture of Nel’Vari.Still not convinced? Or, convinced but just craving more? Let us break it down for you:
7 different playable races - Demon, Angel, Elf, Naga, Elemental, Human, and the animal race Amari
Highly customizable appearance - create an avatar that represents whoever you want to be
Customizable homes in all three worlds (if we hit those stretch goals!) - a well-decorated home can increase your social standing with your neighbors
Pets - choose a buddy to join you on your adventures
IF THIS CAMPAIGN IS A SUCCESS - Mounts to carry you along your journey
 Even your pet has their own aesthetic.Not just dogs and cats here - clouds make great pets, too!Pet Concept Arts.Who says it's weird to have three refrigerators?Player race variations...and counting!  You’re certain to face many challenges on your journey in Sun Haven, but you don’t have to face them alone!Your friends and fellow adventurers can join your town to aid your quest. We’re designing the game for multiplayer from the get-go so you and your friends can jump into the adventure together right away. We expect to support up to 8 heroes together at once on one player-hosted server. Adventuring, treasure-seeking, farming, and making a life for yourself is always easier - and more fun - with back up!We’re accounting for the immensity of 8-player multiplayer wherever we can. To start, we’re developing a multiplayer game mode with a larger starting farm space for all of your friends to spread out comfortably. Furthermore, we’re toying with the concept of respawning treasure chests in the wild to encourage exploration for all involved players. Farming is better with friends... like 7 of them! A big part of Sun Haven is the unique and magical Wish-Granting mechanic. With this ability, you have the power to make real change by granting wishes. With a Wish, you can make impassable obstacles disappear or help a neighbor find a new home. This power belongs to you alone, so it’s your decision how you’ll use it to help the town. Harness your power to make Wishes come true! Wishes Summary:
Bring new shops to town
Increase the number of goods sold in shops
Help neighbors in need to maintain your community
And for goodness sake, wish the sick puppy back to health!
 Make a Wish! Pre-Wish Café vs Post-Wish Café!   Take a peek at these various concepts and WIPs.Our art speaks for itself, but that doesn’t mean it can’t be explained a little bit.Like many other sim games, we started with 16x16 pixel per unit resolution. But then we decided that just wouldn’t cut it. We want this game to look amazing, so we stepped up the visual aesthetic. To make sure our magical effects would really shine, we bumped the resolution up to 24x24 - that’s 225% of the old pixel density and, well, the results speak for themselves: One of these things is not like the other...Withergate Pumpkin Monster, as featured in the video! Anne's House concept art - or more like concept cart! Watercolor concepts of the Wishing Well  and the Player Home starting area. We agreed that the best way to capture the whimsical and relaxing atmosphere of Sun Haven would be to create its music from scratch using the sounds of real instruments, so that’s how we’re doing it - with no old school pixel-y or arcade-y sounds. All of the music and sound effects in Sun Haven are being composed in-house from the ground up by our talented Sound Designer, Alex (see his handsome mug at the bottom of the page!). Below, you can listen to some of his work. Here we have 2 versions of one of our themes - one concept and one (slightly) more polished iteration.Check them out here: The beautiful track you're listening to is one of the concepts for the Winter Festival event, just one of the town events we're hoping to create in Sun Haven. When we were planning for the game originally, we wrote a story for what the first 20 minutes of gameplay would feel like (Day 1 of Spring), and what the last 20 minutes of the first gameplay year would feel like (ending with the town's Winter Festival). What you're listening to is one of the concepts for what we might want the conclusion of year 1 to feel like. Can you feel it?This cow is in the moo-d for the season!  Hey all! It's Bruce, the Director for Sun Haven writing this section!For the last year, I've paid for everything out of pocket by saving up where I could over the last few years. With a bit of hard work and some extra hours each week, I am neatly and indefinitely able to staff a core functioning team to complete this project. So, to be clear: Sun Haven WILL release IN MAY. Period.In terms of funding support at this point, increased support means we will reliably be able to deliver on all these gems, sparkles, and scope of the game in time.Currently, we’ve already finished our last hiring spree (picking up FOUR new sprouts in the studio!) and I believe we’ve done this right on track for the development curve of completing Sun Haven on time. As both a director and a player dying to play a new farming sim with my friends, I would much rather a studio hire an extra person or two ahead of time to make sure the game comes out great, and on time-- so that’s exactly what we’ve done.While we CAN eventually ship a full scoped Sun Haven over time, I think what’s best for players is getting the chance to play the full scoped game right at release.(If you're gonna put magic, dragons, fantasy, quests, and two worlds into a farming sim... you can't just go halfway, right?)The dev side of things for us right now (outside of marketing) is pushing to flesh out our Alpha versions as fast as we can-- As such, I would say this game will be shippable by the end of this month, December. In terms of early access, we probably won't do early access because we really want the game to have its full vision when players first get their hands on it. I'd hate to come off as developers that aren't thoughtful in execution just because we didn’t allow ourselves enough time to polish a beta version of the game we’d later throw away.Our 14 person team needs community support to make Sun Haven the fantastic game at the scope that includes everything that we (and players) have been wanting. And to make this game at the scope that's going to fully satisfy the farming sim AND the RPG elements, we're going to need to make enough quests, items, and thoughtfully immersive settings for the combat and worldbuilding. Please help us make our dream game the absolute best it can be!In terms of actual financial breakdown, the allocation of funds received by our very attractive backers would look like this:Where Funds will be allocated!   Thanks so much for your support!- The Pixel Sprout Studios Team  SOCIALSOur Site: https://pixelsproutstudios.com/Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/SunHavenDiscord: http://discord.gg/BqTCygETwitter: https://twitter.com/SunHavenRPGInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/sunhavenrpg/Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1089564...Tumblr: https://sunhavenrpg.tumblr.com/Pinterest:https://www.pinterest.com/SunHavenRPG/ Questions about this project? Check out the FAQ here, on the discord, or read more on the website!",99.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Hello, my name is Russell Vint, the founder of Ninox. I'm excited to reveal Ninox's third product, the Astrum - a medium sized modular mouse. This mouse is a little different to the previous ones that Ninox has produced, since it has been designed and prototyped entirely in house, both in software and hardware.</strong></p>
<p><img alt=""Astrum Black Knight"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ninox.co/files/indiegogo/astrum/photos/blknight.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>In order to make the best mouse that I possibly could, I needed to take control of all aspects of its design, something which hasn't been possible in the past. I'm hoping that with your help, I can make the Astrum a reality. The Astrum has been fully designed and prototyped, the only thing it needs are the funds to create the molds necessary for production. Please take a moment to read through the features below, or watch the video above to find out more!</strong></p>
<div style=""height:60px;""> </div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Modular</h3>
<p>When designing the Astrum, the focus was on gaming performance and comfort, with a grown up, classic design. You can choose from three main shapes - Alpha, Beta and Beta Ergnomic. Then, you can choose where you would like side buttons - on the left side, the right side, both sides, or no side buttons at all, for a total of 4, 6 or 8 mouse buttons. Left handed people are fully catered for. <strong>Everything you need is included in the Astrum's box!</strong></p>
<p><img alt=""Astrum Overview"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ninox.co/files/indiegogo/astrum/photos/ninox-astrum-02.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><img alt=""Astrum Parts"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ninox.co/files/indiegogo/astrum/photos/ninox-astrum-03.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The Astrum's shapes each have names, and symbols which represent the options, so that you can quickly identify each variant. The name represents the overall shape, and the symbols after the name represent the configuration. For example, Alpha IX is the Alpha shape, with side buttons on the left, and no side buttons on the right. Another example, Beta IE, is side buttons on the left, and an ergonomic attachment on the right. The diagram below illustrates the different shapes and configurations that the Astrum offers:</p>
<p><img alt=""Astrum Shapes"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ninox.co/files/indiegogo/astrum/photos/shapes.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<div style=""height:60px;""> </div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Lightweight</h3>
<p>When you're playing to win, and for extended periods of time, a lighter mouse can be very helpful. Not only is it less straining over time, it also responds more quickly, is generally easier to use, and requires less of a firm grip to lift. It is therefore less distracting, allowing you to forget about everything else, and focus on the game. Weighing under 80 grams no matter which shape you choose, the Astrum is one of the lightest gaming mice available, despite it being so customisable.</p>
<div style=""height:60px;""> </div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Optical microswitches and scroll wheel</h3>
<p>The Astrum uses optical microswitches for its left and right mouse buttons, and an optical scroll wheel encoder. This means that they'll last much longer than traditional mechanical alternatives. The microswitches are rated at over 90 million clicks, and the scroll wheel at 50 million scrolls - <strong>over four times the lifespan of most gaming mice currently available</strong>. Being optical, they also require less error protection, so they respond much faster than their traditional mechanical counterparts.</p>
<p><img alt=""Astrum Photo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ninox.co/files/indiegogo/astrum/photos/opticalswitch.gif"" src="""" style=""width: 345px;height: auto;""/> <img alt=""Astrum Photo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ninox.co/files/indiegogo/astrum/photos/opticalencoder.gif"" src="""" style=""width: 345px;height: auto;""/></p>
<div style=""height:60px;""> </div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Top tier sensor: The Pixart PMW-3360</h3>
<p>You can't make a top tier gaming mouse without the top tier sensor. <strong>It is the highest performing sensor available</strong>, with the fastest tracking speeds, lowest amount of processing for the rawest feel, and plenty of tuning options, which are fully unlocked on the Astrum software.</p>
<p><img alt=""Astrum Sensor"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ninox.co/files/indiegogo/astrum/photos/sensor.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<div style=""height:60px;""> </div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Lowest latency possible</h3>
<p>The firmware for the Astrum has been created with the help of Miodrag, a programmer employed by Ninox, and is based on a very low latency firmware written by an Overclock.net forum member Qsxcv. With full control over how it is coded, we are able to squeeze the very best from every aspect of the mouse. A lot of mice are programmed by companies which are outsourced by the factory who makes the mouse, where there are many different companies involed, very little control, and no chance to see the source code. Being deeply involved in the programming process, along with using low latency components such as optical micro switches, allows the Astrum to be one of the lowest latency mice ever created, <strong>with around 200% improvement over most other mice</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt=""Astrum Programming"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ninox.co/files/indiegogo/astrum/photos/programming.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<div style=""height:60px;""> </div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Change settings with hardware or software</h3>
<p>If you need to change basic settings, such as DPI and LED colour, or lift distance cutoff, you can accomplish that with the Astrum <strong>without needing to install software</strong>. Simply hold down the profile button (the button behind the scroll wheel), while the profile you wish to change options for is active, and press buttons on the mouse to change settings. For example, pressing the side buttons will switch between different LED colours, and the front buttons will switch between different DPI levels. Please see the video below for an example:</p>
<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bat7olKDiE0"" width=""560""></iframe></div><p>For those who prefer more control, an optional software program will be available, which you can install on your <strong>Windows, Linux or Mac</strong> computer. In this software, you'll have full access to all of the options that the Pixart 3360 sensor offers, and also full LED control, profiles, and macros. You'll even have access to advanced options, such as setting the button debounce timing, activating or deactivating power saving, and manually fine tuning your lift distance cut-off.</p>
<p><img alt=""Astrum Sensor"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ninox.co/files/indiegogo/astrum/photos/software.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<div style=""height:60px;""> </div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Super flexible cable</h3>
<p>There's no point in having a lightweight mouse, if the cable isn't flexible. I started working on a flexible cable with our previous mouse, the Venator, which was one of the most flexible cables available on a gaming mouse. For the Astrum, a lot of progress have been made to improve it even further.</p>
<p><img alt=""Astrum Cable"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ninox.co/files/indiegogo/astrum/photos/cable.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<div style=""height:60px;""> </div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Adjustable Sensor Position</h3>
<p>The small details matter. When researching which sensor position people preferred, there was no clear winner. Some people prefer it close towards the front, some prefer it in the middle, some prefer it towards the rear. These were strong preferences! So, rather than picking one position, and disappointing two thirds of customers, I decided to create a way for the sensor position to be adjustable, so you can have it where it best suits you.</p>
<p><img alt=""Astrum Sensor Position"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ninox.co/files/indiegogo/astrum/photos/ninox-astrum-04.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<div style=""height:60px;""> </div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Split trigger buttons</h3>
<p>Rather than making the buttons part of the shell, split trigger buttons are connected internally, which allows their stiffness to be tuned, by how thick the plastic is where they bend. Making the buttons part of the shell means this isn't possible. Split trigger buttons give a purer representation of the microwitch used, so they don't make them artificially harder or easier to click, resulting in more intuative and satisfying operation.</p>
<p><img alt=""Astrum Buttons"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ninox.co/files/indiegogo/astrum/photos/buttons.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<div style=""height:60px;""> </div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">3D print your own creation</h3>
<p>With the Astrum, you are free to design your own parts, and recreate the mouse however you like! <strong>Templates will be available on the Ninox website</strong>, which you can download, and use them in CAD software to design new parts. Simply have your designs 3D printed, and you have yourself a bespoke mouse! Don't feel like designing parts? Designers are free to share their creations with anyone they like, and they can submit their designs to the Ninox website, so after some time, there could be a lot of different designs to choose from!</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Changing the shape of the Astrum</h3>
<p><img alt=""Astrum Modular"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ninox.co/files/indiegogo/astrum/photos/modular.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Changing the side parts is easy! Simply remove the screw from the base, so that the top cover can be removed. Once the top cover is removed, the side parts can be detached by pulling them outwards from the mouse's sides. To attach new side parts, align the locating pins with the holes in the side of the mouse, and push on. They will clip into place. The top cover can now be attached, and secured by replacing the screw in the base. <strong>To see it in action, please view the below video!</strong></p>
<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/yTVaHGwdgyc?rel=0"" width=""560""></iframe></div><p>Some people may ask, 'Why not use magnets?'. There are two main reasons why. Firstly, weight - magnets add weight, theres no getting around that! Secondly, strength - using magnets can cause the parts to wobble, and accidentally detach. One of the main goals during the design of the Astrum was a high quality and sturdy feel, something that would have been difficult to achieve with magnets alone. Magnets were a part of the development process (to see if they offered any extra stability), in fact, you can see them in the above video if you look closely, however, they were found to be unnecessary.</p>

<p>The Astrum's shapes were designed by myself, and then sent to a CAD design studio in England, to complete the 3D models. We went through numerous different ways to have the parts of the mouse attach, it wasn't easy, but we eventually found a way which works very well. Throughout the design and development process, we used 3D printing, to test the shapes and functionality of the mouse. We used one of the highest accuracy 3D printers available, to get the best idea of what the mouse would be like once it's been injection molded, so we could be confident in the dimensions.</p>
<p>For the internal circuitry, we used the Teensy 2.0 development board, and a specially made sensor board, along with custom PCBs for the microswitches. The final PCB for the Astrum is pretty much an exact duplicate of these boards, so it allowed us to use this setup for the whole process, which was very useful, since it makes things very easy to change if necessary. The only downside is the amount of wires (but of course, they aren't like that in the final product).</p>
<p>There will be continual updates during the final stages of the Astrum's development and manufacturing progress, in the updates section! Please see below for some photos of the Astrum protoype:</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Please note that the below photos are of 3D printed prototypes, with prototype circuit boards. The production version will have smooth surfaces, and a lot less wiring, using neat ribbon cables where needed.</h3>

<p><img alt=""About Title"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ninox.co/files/indiegogo/astrum/titles/about.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">About the Founder</h3>
<p>I've always had a passion for technology and design, for most of my life after college, I worked with computers, starting out with web design, which was a nice mix of the two things I like most. However, I always wanted to design an actual physical thing, rather than graphical. When I started Ninox, it was because I felt it was something I would enjoy doing. Designing the Astrum has involved a lot of hard work, but it never really felt like it!</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Ninox History</h3>
<p>Ninox launched its first product in 2014, it was the first time I had ever started a company, made a product, ordered from factories, pretty much everything about it was new to me. It took a long time to develop the first product, the Aurora gaming mouse, and learnt a lot in the process. However, I realised that the Aurora, being my first attempt, had room for improvement. After allowing everything I had learnt to sink in, I wanted to release a new product that gave people more confidence in the brand. So a year and a half ago, I worked with a new factory and developed the second product, the Venator. The development time was just three months, about 15 months faster than the Aurora, and overall the mouse has been very well received, winning many top awards in reviews. I've also improved things like customer support, shipping, returns, and worldwide availabilty.</p>
<p><img alt=""Ninox Venator Awards"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ninox.co/files/indiegogo/astrum/venator-awards.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The problem with the Aurora and the Venator, is that they're ""ODM"" mice, which are mice already made by a factory, which can be customised. I can instruct the factory which sensor and components I need, and how I would like the firmware to be programmed, but what can be done is quite limited. I have no say in how the shell is designed, aside from improving a couple of small areas.</p>
<p>Now the company is at the point where I wanted it to be a long time ago. It's not ideal to rely on factory mouse shells, and factory outsourced programming. To really make the products I envision, I need to be deeply involved in the entire design process. This is what the Astrum is, a mouse designed by someone with a huge amount of passion and enjoyment in what they do!</p>
<p>I hope I have proven with the Venator, that Ninox can be a serious brand, and that I am more than capable of seeing through many great projects, leading to products that people would be excited and proud to own.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why crowdfunding?</h3>
<p>Making a mouse like the Astrum is expensive. The tooling for the plastic parts alone costs around $40,000. The factory where its made, require a minimum order quantity of 1000. The design costs are more than $10,000. I have funded some of this, but I can't fund the entire amount, so thats why I need your help to bring the Astrum to life!</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">One man?</h3>
<p>So how does one person run Ninox?</p>
<p>Of course, it would be impossible to run if it were a larger company. But at the moment, I have a couple of products, and it's not so difficult. A lot of the heavy lifting, like distribution, industrial design, programming, manufacturing, is outsourced - but outsourced to the right, carefully selected people and companies. I have an active role in all aspects of the company, in that I manage everything, but in many ways, its not so different to having employees. In the past, running a company like this would have been impossible, but these days, its a lot easier. I carefully interview, and continually monitor each and every person and company who I work with, and I will only work with professionals who are clear and honest communicators and capable of seeing a project through to completion.</p>

<p> </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>How long is the warranty on the Astrum?</strong><ul><li>The Astrum comes with a two year warranty.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Will I have to pay import duties and/or taxes?</strong><ul><li>The Astrum will be shipped from within the US, UK, EU, Canada, and Australia. Deliveries within those countries are delivered with all taxes and duties paid. Outside of those countries, you may be charged import duties and/or taxes.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Can you be more specific about the weight of the mouse?</strong><ul><li>It's not possible to be more specific about the weight at this stage, since there may yet be slight changes which will affect it. However, once the final weight is known, an update will be posted to inform everyone, with photos.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>What plastic is the mouse made from?</strong><ul><li>The Astrum is made from ABS plastic, since it offers a good strength to weight ratio.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>With all of these attachable parts, won't the mouse be unstable, and rattle or creak?</strong><ul><li>Great care has been taken to prevent any issues like this. For example, the internal structure of the Astrum is coated in rubber, for a dampening and gripping effect, completely eliminating any unwanted noises. Once the Astrum's parts are in place, it is very strong, and won't rattle or come apart! Most mice you can buy are clipped together, the Astrum just makes it easier to unclip the different parts and exchange them for different ones.</li></ul>

<strong>How do the optical microswitches and scroll wheel feel?</strong><ul><li>The microswitches are similar to the Omron D2FC feel, which is a common mouse microswitch, they need the same kind of force to operate, and are just as quiet. The optical scroll wheel has a very smooth yet tactile feel, and is quiet. The scroll wheel button has also had careful attention, to make sure it isn't too difficult, or too easy to press.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>I don't play any games, but could I use the Astrum as a home or office mouse?</strong><ul><li>Absolutely. A high end gaming mouse generally has excellent quality, comfort and features which are perfect for home or office use. The one thing you may miss, is horizontal scrolling, but that can be assigned to the side buttons on the right side of the mouse. However, other than that, it can easily handle anything you throw at it!</li></ul>

<p><img alt=""Future Developments Title"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ninox.co/files/indiegogo/astrum/titles/future.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Given the Astrum's modular design, future products can be designed around it, without incurring too much cost or development time. For example, a rear humped version only needs new exterior panels, and a wireless version only needs fairly minor alterations to the internal parts and software. A smaller version of the Astrum would take more time than either of those, but when a new project is ready to begin, people who are interested will be given the opportunity to vote for what they'd like to see.</p>
<p>Whether or not these future projects happen, depends on the original Astrum's crowd funding success. If it is extremely successful, then the future products below would not even need to be crowd funded! Please take a look at the list below to see what the potential future has in store:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Astrum S</strong><ul><li>A smaller version of the Astrum, lower and shorter, with a more curved front for those who like to wrap their fingers around.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Astrum R</strong><ul><li>A version of the Astrum which has its highest point (its 'hump') further towards the rear of the mouse, like the Ninox Venator. It may be possible to convert original Astrum mice with the Astrum R parts, which could be sold separately.</li></ul>

</div></div>","Hello, my name is Russell Vint, the founder of Ninox. I'm excited to reveal Ninox's third product, the Astrum - a medium sized modular mouse. This mouse is a little different to the previous ones that Ninox has produced, since it has been designed and prototyped entirely in house, both in software and hardware.

In order to make the best mouse that I possibly could, I needed to take control of all aspects of its design, something which hasn't been possible in the past. I'm hoping that with your help, I can make the Astrum a reality. The Astrum has been fully designed and prototyped, the only thing it needs are the funds to create the molds necessary for production. Please take a moment to read through the features below, or watch the video above to find out more!
 
Modular
When designing the Astrum, the focus was on gaming performance and comfort, with a grown up, classic design. You can choose from three main shapes - Alpha, Beta and Beta Ergnomic. Then, you can choose where you would like side buttons - on the left side, the right side, both sides, or no side buttons at all, for a total of 4, 6 or 8 mouse buttons. Left handed people are fully catered for. Everything you need is included in the Astrum's box!


The Astrum's shapes each have names, and symbols which represent the options, so that you can quickly identify each variant. The name represents the overall shape, and the symbols after the name represent the configuration. For example, Alpha IX is the Alpha shape, with side buttons on the left, and no side buttons on the right. Another example, Beta IE, is side buttons on the left, and an ergonomic attachment on the right. The diagram below illustrates the different shapes and configurations that the Astrum offers:

 
Lightweight
When you're playing to win, and for extended periods of time, a lighter mouse can be very helpful. Not only is it less straining over time, it also responds more quickly, is generally easier to use, and requires less of a firm grip to lift. It is therefore less distracting, allowing you to forget about everything else, and focus on the game. Weighing under 80 grams no matter which shape you choose, the Astrum is one of the lightest gaming mice available, despite it being so customisable.
 
Optical microswitches and scroll wheel
The Astrum uses optical microswitches for its left and right mouse buttons, and an optical scroll wheel encoder. This means that they'll last much longer than traditional mechanical alternatives. The microswitches are rated at over 90 million clicks, and the scroll wheel at 50 million scrolls - over four times the lifespan of most gaming mice currently available. Being optical, they also require less error protection, so they respond much faster than their traditional mechanical counterparts.
 
 
Top tier sensor: The Pixart PMW-3360
You can't make a top tier gaming mouse without the top tier sensor. It is the highest performing sensor available, with the fastest tracking speeds, lowest amount of processing for the rawest feel, and plenty of tuning options, which are fully unlocked on the Astrum software.

 
Lowest latency possible
The firmware for the Astrum has been created with the help of Miodrag, a programmer employed by Ninox, and is based on a very low latency firmware written by an Overclock.net forum member Qsxcv. With full control over how it is coded, we are able to squeeze the very best from every aspect of the mouse. A lot of mice are programmed by companies which are outsourced by the factory who makes the mouse, where there are many different companies involed, very little control, and no chance to see the source code. Being deeply involved in the programming process, along with using low latency components such as optical micro switches, allows the Astrum to be one of the lowest latency mice ever created, with around 200% improvement over most other mice.

 
Change settings with hardware or software
If you need to change basic settings, such as DPI and LED colour, or lift distance cutoff, you can accomplish that with the Astrum without needing to install software. Simply hold down the profile button (the button behind the scroll wheel), while the profile you wish to change options for is active, and press buttons on the mouse to change settings. For example, pressing the side buttons will switch between different LED colours, and the front buttons will switch between different DPI levels. Please see the video below for an example:
For those who prefer more control, an optional software program will be available, which you can install on your Windows, Linux or Mac computer. In this software, you'll have full access to all of the options that the Pixart 3360 sensor offers, and also full LED control, profiles, and macros. You'll even have access to advanced options, such as setting the button debounce timing, activating or deactivating power saving, and manually fine tuning your lift distance cut-off.

 
Super flexible cable
There's no point in having a lightweight mouse, if the cable isn't flexible. I started working on a flexible cable with our previous mouse, the Venator, which was one of the most flexible cables available on a gaming mouse. For the Astrum, a lot of progress have been made to improve it even further.

 
Adjustable Sensor Position
The small details matter. When researching which sensor position people preferred, there was no clear winner. Some people prefer it close towards the front, some prefer it in the middle, some prefer it towards the rear. These were strong preferences! So, rather than picking one position, and disappointing two thirds of customers, I decided to create a way for the sensor position to be adjustable, so you can have it where it best suits you.

 
Split trigger buttons
Rather than making the buttons part of the shell, split trigger buttons are connected internally, which allows their stiffness to be tuned, by how thick the plastic is where they bend. Making the buttons part of the shell means this isn't possible. Split trigger buttons give a purer representation of the microwitch used, so they don't make them artificially harder or easier to click, resulting in more intuative and satisfying operation.

 
3D print your own creation
With the Astrum, you are free to design your own parts, and recreate the mouse however you like! Templates will be available on the Ninox website, which you can download, and use them in CAD software to design new parts. Simply have your designs 3D printed, and you have yourself a bespoke mouse! Don't feel like designing parts? Designers are free to share their creations with anyone they like, and they can submit their designs to the Ninox website, so after some time, there could be a lot of different designs to choose from!

 
Changing the shape of the Astrum

Changing the side parts is easy! Simply remove the screw from the base, so that the top cover can be removed. Once the top cover is removed, the side parts can be detached by pulling them outwards from the mouse's sides. To attach new side parts, align the locating pins with the holes in the side of the mouse, and push on. They will clip into place. The top cover can now be attached, and secured by replacing the screw in the base. To see it in action, please view the below video!
Some people may ask, 'Why not use magnets?'. There are two main reasons why. Firstly, weight - magnets add weight, theres no getting around that! Secondly, strength - using magnets can cause the parts to wobble, and accidentally detach. One of the main goals during the design of the Astrum was a high quality and sturdy feel, something that would have been difficult to achieve with magnets alone. Magnets were a part of the development process (to see if they offered any extra stability), in fact, you can see them in the above video if you look closely, however, they were found to be unnecessary.
 


Standard Colours and Coatings
The Astrum is available as standard in matte metallic black, or matte white. The paint is UV cured for extra durability.

The Astrum's shapes were designed by myself, and then sent to a CAD design studio in England, to complete the 3D models. We went through numerous different ways to have the parts of the mouse attach, it wasn't easy, but we eventually found a way which works very well. Throughout the design and development process, we used 3D printing, to test the shapes and functionality of the mouse. We used one of the highest accuracy 3D printers available, to get the best idea of what the mouse would be like once it's been injection molded, so we could be confident in the dimensions.
For the internal circuitry, we used the Teensy 2.0 development board, and a specially made sensor board, along with custom PCBs for the microswitches. The final PCB for the Astrum is pretty much an exact duplicate of these boards, so it allowed us to use this setup for the whole process, which was very useful, since it makes things very easy to change if necessary. The only downside is the amount of wires (but of course, they aren't like that in the final product).
There will be continual updates during the final stages of the Astrum's development and manufacturing progress, in the updates section! Please see below for some photos of the Astrum protoype:
Please note that the below photos are of 3D printed prototypes, with prototype circuit boards. The production version will have smooth surfaces, and a lot less wiring, using neat ribbon cables where needed.

About the Founder
I've always had a passion for technology and design, for most of my life after college, I worked with computers, starting out with web design, which was a nice mix of the two things I like most. However, I always wanted to design an actual physical thing, rather than graphical. When I started Ninox, it was because I felt it was something I would enjoy doing. Designing the Astrum has involved a lot of hard work, but it never really felt like it!
Ninox History
Ninox launched its first product in 2014, it was the first time I had ever started a company, made a product, ordered from factories, pretty much everything about it was new to me. It took a long time to develop the first product, the Aurora gaming mouse, and learnt a lot in the process. However, I realised that the Aurora, being my first attempt, had room for improvement. After allowing everything I had learnt to sink in, I wanted to release a new product that gave people more confidence in the brand. So a year and a half ago, I worked with a new factory and developed the second product, the Venator. The development time was just three months, about 15 months faster than the Aurora, and overall the mouse has been very well received, winning many top awards in reviews. I've also improved things like customer support, shipping, returns, and worldwide availabilty.

The problem with the Aurora and the Venator, is that they're ""ODM"" mice, which are mice already made by a factory, which can be customised. I can instruct the factory which sensor and components I need, and how I would like the firmware to be programmed, but what can be done is quite limited. I have no say in how the shell is designed, aside from improving a couple of small areas.
Now the company is at the point where I wanted it to be a long time ago. It's not ideal to rely on factory mouse shells, and factory outsourced programming. To really make the products I envision, I need to be deeply involved in the entire design process. This is what the Astrum is, a mouse designed by someone with a huge amount of passion and enjoyment in what they do!
I hope I have proven with the Venator, that Ninox can be a serious brand, and that I am more than capable of seeing through many great projects, leading to products that people would be excited and proud to own.
Why crowdfunding?
Making a mouse like the Astrum is expensive. The tooling for the plastic parts alone costs around $40,000. The factory where its made, require a minimum order quantity of 1000. The design costs are more than $10,000. I have funded some of this, but I can't fund the entire amount, so thats why I need your help to bring the Astrum to life!
One man?
So how does one person run Ninox?
Of course, it would be impossible to run if it were a larger company. But at the moment, I have a couple of products, and it's not so difficult. A lot of the heavy lifting, like distribution, industrial design, programming, manufacturing, is outsourced - but outsourced to the right, carefully selected people and companies. I have an active role in all aspects of the company, in that I manage everything, but in many ways, its not so different to having employees. In the past, running a company like this would have been impossible, but these days, its a lot easier. I carefully interview, and continually monitor each and every person and company who I work with, and I will only work with professionals who are clear and honest communicators and capable of seeing a project through to completion.

The graphic below is the projected timeline of the Astrum project, beginning with the crowd funding, and ending in delivery to your door. Please note that the timeline is an estimate, and it could potentially take a slightly longer, or shorter amount of time (for example, hitting the funding goal earlier, allows the tooling stage to begin earlier), however, I have worked closely with the factory and shipping company to create this, and we feel it is a good estimate of how long the project will take. All backers will be notified of any changes that will affect the timeline.

 


 


 


How long is the warranty on the Astrum?The Astrum comes with a two year warranty.


Will I have to pay import duties and/or taxes?The Astrum will be shipped from within the US, UK, EU, Canada, and Australia. Deliveries within those countries are delivered with all taxes and duties paid. Outside of those countries, you may be charged import duties and/or taxes.


Can you be more specific about the weight of the mouse?It's not possible to be more specific about the weight at this stage, since there may yet be slight changes which will affect it. However, once the final weight is known, an update will be posted to inform everyone, with photos.


What plastic is the mouse made from?The Astrum is made from ABS plastic, since it offers a good strength to weight ratio.


With all of these attachable parts, won't the mouse be unstable, and rattle or creak?Great care has been taken to prevent any issues like this. For example, the internal structure of the Astrum is coated in rubber, for a dampening and gripping effect, completely eliminating any unwanted noises. Once the Astrum's parts are in place, it is very strong, and won't rattle or come apart! Most mice you can buy are clipped together, the Astrum just makes it easier to unclip the different parts and exchange them for different ones.


How do the optical microswitches and scroll wheel feel?The microswitches are similar to the Omron D2FC feel, which is a common mouse microswitch, they need the same kind of force to operate, and are just as quiet. The optical scroll wheel has a very smooth yet tactile feel, and is quiet. The scroll wheel button has also had careful attention, to make sure it isn't too difficult, or too easy to press.


I don't play any games, but could I use the Astrum as a home or office mouse?Absolutely. A high end gaming mouse generally has excellent quality, comfort and features which are perfect for home or office use. The one thing you may miss, is horizontal scrolling, but that can be assigned to the side buttons on the right side of the mouse. However, other than that, it can easily handle anything you throw at it!


 


Given the Astrum's modular design, future products can be designed around it, without incurring too much cost or development time. For example, a rear humped version only needs new exterior panels, and a wireless version only needs fairly minor alterations to the internal parts and software. A smaller version of the Astrum would take more time than either of those, but when a new project is ready to begin, people who are interested will be given the opportunity to vote for what they'd like to see.
Whether or not these future projects happen, depends on the original Astrum's crowd funding success. If it is extremely successful, then the future products below would not even need to be crowd funded! Please take a look at the list below to see what the potential future has in store:


Astrum SA smaller version of the Astrum, lower and shorter, with a more curved front for those who like to wrap their fingers around.


Astrum RA version of the Astrum which has its highest point (its 'hump') further towards the rear of the mouse, like the Ninox Venator. It may be possible to convert original Astrum mice with the Astrum R parts, which could be sold separately.


Astrum RSThe same as the Astrum R, but designed to work with the smaller Astrum S mouse.


Astrum Wireless EditionsAll Astrum mice would have a wireless version available.

<p>While the game does have enemy encounters, <strong>grinding will never be required</strong> as the characters do not level up, but learn stronger skills and upgrade their weapons as the story progresses. When planning your team formation for upcoming battles, you don’t have to worry about having under leveled team members.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/rX42eqA.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Every character comes with their own set of skills, some which will make your life easier outside of battles, like the <strong>Interpreter class</strong>, which allows you to communicate with non-English speaking NPCs. You’ll also be able to <strong>craft</strong> and <strong>upgrade</strong> weapons and armor using the items you have collected.</p>
<p>Instead of magic, Long Gone Days uses ""<strong>Morale</strong>"". This stat affects the characters performance in battle. <strong>High Morale</strong> means better chance of critical attacks and higher evasion, while <strong>Low Morale</strong> will drop their accuracy and defense. If their Morale reaches zero, the character will lose their will to fight. To keep their Morale high, you must get to know your party members in order to understand how to motivate them during dialogues. A pessimistic character will not be motivated by mindless encouragement.</p> <p> </p>

</div></div></div></div>","Long Gone Days is a 2D modern-day character-driven RPG that combines elements from visual novels, shooters and dystopian fiction.   The game casts the player as Rourke, a soldier from the Core, a highly isolated place below the surface of the Earth. Just like everybody else in his homeland, Rourke has been trained from birth as a sniper, and knows almost nothing about things unrelated to his job.After finding out the awful truth about the operation he’s part of in Kaliningrad, he takes the decision to abandon his post, not really knowing the overall consequences of deserting. 

In order to prevent the imminent war, the player must join forces with people from different parts of the world, who will assist you with battle tactics, language barriers, and overall teamwork.

 
 

Besides classical RPG elements, Long Gone Days borrows mechanics from other genres, like visual novels, puzzles and shooters.

While the game does have enemy encounters, grinding will never be required as the characters do not level up, but learn stronger skills and upgrade their weapons as the story progresses. When planning your team formation for upcoming battles, you don’t have to worry about having under leveled team members.

Every character comes with their own set of skills, some which will make your life easier outside of battles, like the Interpreter class, which allows you to communicate with non-English speaking NPCs. You’ll also be able to craft and upgrade weapons and armor using the items you have collected.
Instead of magic, Long Gone Days uses ""Morale"". This stat affects the characters performance in battle. High Morale means better chance of critical attacks and higher evasion, while Low Morale will drop their accuracy and defense. If their Morale reaches zero, the character will lose their will to fight. To keep their Morale high, you must get to know your party members in order to understand how to motivate them during dialogues. A pessimistic character will not be motivated by mindless encouragement.  

● Multiplatform Support: Windows, Mac and Linux. Porting to other platforms will be considered if stretch goals are reached.
● Two battle systems: Front-view turn-based combats and a Sniper Mode, which consists of Seek and Find mechanics.

● No random encounters or grinding: The battles are directly related to the plot. Instead of leveling up, your party members will learn new skills, upgrade their weapons and craft new items.
● Keep the team’s morale high: Choosing certain dialogue options will affect your team members' Morale, altering their performance in battle. While doing so, keep in mind every character has different personality traits and motivations.

● Immersion: As you continue your journey through real world locations, some NPCs will speak in their native tongue. This means you’ll need specific party members (interpreters) to help you out to buy at shops and complete quests.

● Non-Fantasy: There are no magical or supernatural elements, only science and technology.
● Battle Strategies: Plan your party lineup accordingly to exploit your enemy’s weaknesses.

● Take care of your team members: Taking quests from your own party or engaging in conversations with them will improve their morale and thus their performance in battle.
● Keyboard and controller support.  

These are only the first four party members you get use:
 
Rourke is 22-year-old hot-blooded sniper from the Core. Up until the beginning of the story, he had never been deployed, being shadowed by the other snipers. Rourke is usually self-absorbed and nothing seems to interest him, unless he can benefit from it. His only motivation is being deployed to escape his monotonous life. 
 

Adair is a 21-year-old combat medic from the Core. While he might come as a rude person because of his serious personality and lack of humour, he’s actually an honest guy who cares about others.
 

Lynn is a 23-year-old strategist living in Kaliningrad. She arrived to the shelters a couple of months before the start of the story. Besides planning defense strategies, she's an expert at bomb crafting.
 

Ivan Cherevatenko is a 29-year-old English-Russian interpreter from Kaliningrad. He works at the shelters, and lives with Lynn. While he refuses to fight, he helps the party by being their translator, and teaching them about the world.
There's more playable characters, but those will be revealed within the story!
 
 

Unlike the demo, the game is being developed on a 16:9 resolution (like most modern games) and the UI has gone through some changes:

Turn-Based Combat System

Exploration


In-Game CGs

Sniper Mode

Dialogues (now with bigger portraits)

One of the distinctive marks of Long Gone Days is its music. We always pictured the story alongside a cinematic prog & post-rock influenced soundtrack.
 
Here's the soundtrack he scored for the film ""El Vuelo de los Cuervos"":

Please note that shipping costs are separate for BackerKit add-ons; if you have any questions or concerns about your final shipping costs, don't hesitate to send us a message!</p><ul><li>What name will you use for the credits?</li></ul><p style=""font-size:14px;"">Any contribution of $70 or more entitles you to have your name in the game's credits! The name we'll be using for this is the <strong>Contributor Name</strong> for your Indiegogo account.

You can also use this method to purchase add-ons only without selecting any reward tiers.What's the deal with censorship and patches?We're very happy to be able to offer Corona Blossom Vol.3 uncensored and entirely mosaic-free in the west, as we did with Vol.2!Here's a little breakdown of the game's versions for you:・Steam version ($9.99): all-ages, adult scenes are not included・Indiegogo exclusive DVD-ROM package ($20): 18+, uncensored/without mosaic censorship (for customers outside of Japan only)・Japanese physical download card package (2000yen plus tax): 18+, with mosaic censorship・18+ patch ($9.99/1000yen plus tax): restores 18+ content (mosaic-free for customers outside of Japan only) to the Steam versionPlease note again that the uncensored 18+ patch will only be available outside of Japan, and will be distributed on J-List, a platform which does not allow access from Japanese IP addresses.We also know a number of people expressed dissatisfaction with the pricing model for Corona Blossom Vol.1's 18+ patch; we are definitely keeping this feedback in mind for future products, but we felt that in the case of Corona Blossom it would not be fair to our all-ages customers to change the pricing model in the middle of the series' release. The discounted $15 set of the Steam version and 18+ patch will be available during and after the campaign (via InDemand), and we hope you can agree that this is a fair compromise given the circumstances.What are shipping costs like?For the Corona Blossom Vol.1 campaign, we only offered EMS as a shipping method. We still find EMS to be the quickest and most reliable method of shipping; however, a number of you were concerned about its high cost, so we decided to make SAL available as well for our future campaigns. Unfortunately there's no way to set multiple shipping options on Indiegogo, so we've set the default shipping costs as those for SAL. If you would prefer your rewards to be shipped via EMS, please send us a message and we'll walk you through getting your shipping upgraded! Please note that shipping costs are separate for BackerKit add-ons; if you have any questions or concerns about your final shipping costs, don't hesitate to send us a message!What name will you use for the credits?Any contribution of $70 or more entitles you to have your name in the game's credits! The name we'll be using for this is the Contributor Name for your Indiegogo account. If you would like to use a different name, or do not want your name in the credits, please contact us before the campaign ends. We may not be able to facilitate any name change or removal requests after the campaign period.",27.0,0,"4 Campaigns

Our primary goal is to publish a polished and bug free game.  We reached that goal ! Now we will finish the Mims Beginning for sure! 






Additional game mode. In survival mode you choose a stage, build your own colony, defend it against waves of predators and face unpredictable dangerous events. We reached that goal!  You could still support us and help to reach next goals!





Five additional mythical and funny adventures (missions) for you to enjoy. 




Will come out shortly after the release of “The Mims Beginning”. Additional missions follow the adventures of the tragically lost Mims crew. This pack will be free for all backers.


""Fortunately, you’re god! Or at least, you’re basically god. I doubt the Mims can tell the difference. This means that on top of being in charge of RTS-like defense and expansion, you’ve got various “PSI” powers at your disposal – for instance, rain clouds, crowd control explosions, and buffs that turn your citizens from baby Oompa Loompas to this version of Carrot Top.""
Rock Paper Shotgun - Nathan Grayson""Everything in a game has been crafted in a gorgeous way. From creature to building, you will find the Mims to be one of the best indie games of the year 2014. ""
Rx6Gaming News - Dolores McLaren

""The Mims: Beginning has become the latest indie hopeful to head down the crowd-funding route, popping up on Indiegogo. And it’s a bit of a looker, putting many so-called “AAA” games to shame with a visual style which brings to mind titles as diverse as Spore and Black & White."" 
Indie Game Magazine - Dale Morgan

 ""In the spirit of brevity, if you like Populous and/or found Bullfrog titles of yore to be up your alley, heave coin into the construction pool and stay tuned. The Mims: Beginning does justice to the Molyneux heyday – arguably the zenith of the quirky simulation – by being both irrepressibly charming and filled to the brim with those curious mechanical subsystems we rarely see in contemporary gaming.""
D22-zone - Max Downton
""The gameplay so far feels pretty solid, and is very much in line with what you’d expect from a city builder.The Mims Beginning is on Greenlight and could use some love. Head on over and give it a thumbs up! It is also currently on Indiegogo so if you’d like to get involved, head on over there as well.""Greenlit Gaming - Alex Coccia“The Mims Beginning” is a Real Time Strategy game with a dose of cosmic humor. The story takes place in an unknown space and time. In this galaxy mythical floating islands give shelter to all kinds of unusual and dangerous creatures.The game combines numerous types of gameplay. Your colonists act on their own most of the time, they do their duties without order from the leader. However, you can control them directly by issuing simple commands.With a use of godlike PSI powers the leader can influence living things in his range of power and strengthen his colony. This feature is quite similar to the “Populous the Beginning” game.The game focuses mainly on expansion and defense of the the colony. Every building or plant placement is important, but still the game is to be considered a light strategy. There are also elements known to more casual gamers, that will require fast reactions from the player.As a player you act as the current leader of a Mims settlement. The Mims are sympathetic creatures traveling through outer space in search of a friendly world to settle.During the intergalactic journey their spaceship is destroyed by an asteroid and the crew is forced to evacuate on nearby planets which are not always friendly.Your goal is to perform various tasks required to reconstruct the spaceship. You can help them by properly developing your new colonies. Every mission takes place on a different planet where separate groups of castaways face their own fate.
""The Mims Beginning started off as an idea for a strategy game and evolved into a beautiful world with a beautiful story. You play a God-like caretaker of a colony of creatures called Mims who are space travelers stranded in a strange place when their ship was hit by a meteor""  Biasbear.com 
The basic element which is crucial for the colony’s existence and development is energy. The energy is necessary to replenish the Mims’ vitality used up while performing work, also for proper functioning of the infrastructure. It is produced in a generator using Bio Mass derived from special fruit processed in the Extractor. Part of the energy can also be obtained from the wind flow thanks to correct placement of Wind Turbines.The tasks performed by the Mims should include the expansion of the colony and picking up the Bio fruit.Some of the Mims act as a protection against various and dangerous creatures attracted to our planet by the scent of fruit and animals.The Mims’ knowledge allows them to create animals that feed on appropriate sets of fruit. Grown animals can be sent to the ‘Space Market’ and exchanged for crystals necessary for further development of the colony. In order to grow fruit for the animals they need to sow seeds from various plant species. Among others, an exploding plant that throws fruit around. Choosing good planting sites is important.A clever ruler is able to use topography thereby avoiding excessive scattering of fruit all over the planet. In case of a bad placement crop is lost due to fruit rolling off the edge of the planet. As the ruler of the colony you govern from the Psi Tower which greatly reinforces your supernatural abilities. As a result you have a range of powers that can affect the environment of our planet.If the crops are not harvested on time they will rot and you will lose important resources. In the game you can develop buildings, plants, acquire new Psi powers, as well as invent new skills for your Mims.
We want to finish creating our light strategy game placed in a fantastic world filled with humor and interesting adventures.We want our game to be seriously challenging but also to have a cartoonish eye-candy style.Badly governed colony expansion may end with a crisis and chaos on our planet, in which case you might be forced to restart a map.Even though the game has a lot of fancy buildings with different functions, it holds the typical strategy game rules. You can build structures, plant, invent technologies and seeds, protect your animal herds and sell them when they’re grown.Your colony citizens can be converted into a special class - the guardians, whose sole purpose is to defend the rest of the population.During the story, Mims also have to face threats from outer space. One of them is a meteor storm that can wreak havoc among your colonists. But when luck is on your side, they might encounter showers of valuable fruits or gems. In order to be prepared you can invent technology that allows you to foresee future events.Mims are little, crazy creatures with a good sense of humor. They got lesser PSI powers that allow them to do some basic colony work and listen to leader's commands. In spite of their good intentions their clumsiness often makes them fail miserably in carrying out their orders.

 
• Expansion of a colony • Autonomy of characters • Researching new technologies• Upgrading buildings • Simulation of God • Special powers at player's disposal • Protecting colony from wildlife predators and vermin • Planting your own fruit crops • Various species of plants with different ways of yielding fruit • Creating and taking care of livestock • Selling livestock at the intergalactic market • Timeline allowing to predict the future events • Keeping away pests and predators by controlling smell sensor • Various floating islands with many unusual adventures (campaign Mode)                                                                   

We are a team of three people sharing a mutual dream of developing our own game.One day, about 18 months ago, we decided to create our own game. It was not an easy task, but from the very beginning we were engaging in it with passion and persistence. Even after our accounts dried out, we loaned to cover our life expenses. Since our situation became so complicated we decided to try crowdfunding to help us finish our project and deliver it to the gamers. We need YOUR support in order to complete our project without haste and pressure.Together, let’s make the world a little more fun!

Jakub -  Uses his lunch break to feed a starving bear.I think that my experience with creating graphics is little compared to the scale of The Mims Beginning. I'm 21, the first strategy game I have played was ""Knight's and Merchants"". I always loved to draw with a pencil and film editing was my passion since primary school. Against the will of my family and teachers I decided to become a part of an Indie game team instead of going to university.

Tomek - When he is not programming, he is teaching Mims catback-riding.My first interest in game programming was a long time ago in primary school after playing “Prince of Persia” in DOS. From that time on I invested most of my time in learning about game programming. Making such a complicated project like The Mims Beginning was a big task but years of experience helped me accomplish it.
Krzysztof - In this picture he just failed to show a bunch of Mims how to play the piano.
I don't really like to write about myself, but if I must...I've been interested in music since childhood so I joined music school. I've been studying for about 6 years gaining basic knowledge about rules in music.One day my friend asked me if I want to help him with his game project. I agreed and my adventure with composing began. Since then, I have broadened my knowledge about sound design and sound engineering mostly by reading magazines or watching tutorials on theInternet. My plans for future are ambitious. I want to finish sound engineering in AGH Univeristy in Cracow.The process of creating sounds and music in The Mims Beginning isn't simple, especially when it comes to the unique Mims language. It requires a lot of tests and experiments. I hope the sound design is going in the right direction. But this is only a hope. You will verify it…


 


Our first plan scheduled that we would work on this game for about 6 months. It ended up as always – we were too optimistic and since the beginning we have been working for about 18 months now. When we started out, our team consisted of only two people. We are now working full-time on this project and we are living off our limited savings. The game is 90% complete but we still need funds for the final stage of The Mims Beginning.We do not have any publisher, and our advertising budget is non-existent. Still we want to maintain our independence and make The Mims Beginning the best we can. Because of that, we need some funding to get us through winter so we can complete the game without excessive strain on our health.Supporting us and joining the Mims family will grant you our product at a cheaper rate, also you can have some influence on the game itself if you decide to support us by investing into more advanced perks.
They say that time is money and we need some more time to finish the game. We want to add more interesting stories, more graphics and features
Voice actor for some of our cutscenes
Quality cutscenes - we would like to prepare better cutscenes that will provide better experience during storytelling
Professional translation

Longer testing period that will allow us to find all possible in-game bugs

Additional game mode for people still hungry for the Mims after completing the main story



We want to present our work to the vast world

Steam Greenlight we are counting on you to vote on us
We want to reach a community of people interested in The Mims Beginning




Our game idea was born about half a thousand days ago. After creating a game design document we started full-time work on our game in 2012. Since then we have been working full-time on this project. It is quite touching to see how far we have come on our own terms. Below we provide some of the early drawings from about 18 months ago.

Description of exemplary adventure in The Mims Beginning.  One group of castaways landed on unknown land. In its center the Mims sighted a strange canyon with strange looking plants. They scouted that it swallowed the psionic engine from their destroyed ship and mutated into a dangerous being threatening their future.They decided to solve this problem by extracting the psionic engine out of the plant. Unfortunately the only passage is completely overgrown with plants and it is simply not possible to pass through it.To solve the problem, as a player you have to expand our PSI powers to a degree that will allow you to use it on plants and completely destroy them to make a way passable for your guardians.You must hurry because it releases more and more dangerous predators to defend itself! This is simply an exemplary adventure that the player will face during the story. There are things you cannot even imagine in The Mims Beginning exquisite world. It's your duty to solve all the puzzles and neutralize all dangers in order to rebuild the spaceship.

<h3><strong>Plague Road Rebirth</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The</strong> <strong><i>Rebirth</i>:</strong></p>
<p>Back in 2017, production of the original game was lamentably cut short due to deadlines, releasing a game that was complete but lacking all the features originally planned. Haunted by the potential of what the game could have been, we decided to completely redo and rerelease it. This is Plague Road but rebooted, and rebirthed!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Features</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leveling up of all survivor units</li>
<li>Unlimited survivors to find to join your team, each with their own stats and skills</li>
<li>Find perks in the world to fully customize each unit to your playing style</li>
<li>Procedurally generated levels and survivor units, so every run is different</li>
<li>12 Areas to explore (unlike 5 like the original)</li>
<li>100's of different Relic's you will find on your runs</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1625135169/w6hcbkdsiq1hvxmtlnur.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Survivors</strong>: </p>
<p>One of the most frequent requests received after launch was the ability to level up. In Plague Road Rebirth, you will receive XP after each battle to level up your survivors. Use the XP to unlock skills and perks, or change them back at the farm.</p>
<p>But be warned, like the original, if your survivor dies in battle, <u>they are gone forever</u>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1625135204/sq7lvwistiy0pasbjkpv.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>New areas</strong>:</p>
<p>Revisit familiar levels that are now less busy and newly redone with ray tracing and added shaders, or see if you are brave enough to survive 7 new levels, and explore the grim city, Pestepolis.</p>
<p>Injured and worn from your travels? You can now stop at camps to recuperate and heal for battles to come!</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Shrines</strong>:</p>
<p>One new feature you will come across on your runs is Shrines which grant you relics that will either help or hinder you on your journey. Will you be awarded extra health or the ability to cause fire damage? Or will you be poisoned and scrambling to craft a cure in time?</p>

Back in 2017, production of the original game was lamentably cut short due to deadlines, releasing a game that was complete but lacking all the features originally planned. Haunted by the potential of what the game could have been, we decided to completely redo and rerelease it. This is Plague Road but rebooted, and rebirthed!
 
Features:

Leveling up of all survivor units
Unlimited survivors to find to join your team, each with their own stats and skills
Find perks in the world to fully customize each unit to your playing style
Procedurally generated levels and survivor units, so every run is different
12 Areas to explore (unlike 5 like the original)
100's of different Relic's you will find on your runs

 

 
Survivors: 
One of the most frequent requests received after launch was the ability to level up. In Plague Road Rebirth, you will receive XP after each battle to level up your survivors. Use the XP to unlock skills and perks, or change them back at the farm.
But be warned, like the original, if your survivor dies in battle, they are gone forever.

 
New areas:
Revisit familiar levels that are now less busy and newly redone with ray tracing and added shaders, or see if you are brave enough to survive 7 new levels, and explore the grim city, Pestepolis.
Injured and worn from your travels? You can now stop at camps to recuperate and heal for battles to come!

 
Shrines:
One new feature you will come across on your runs is Shrines which grant you relics that will either help or hinder you on your journey. Will you be awarded extra health or the ability to cause fire damage? Or will you be poisoned and scrambling to craft a cure in time?

 
Perks:
After gaining XP, you will unlock slots you can fill with perks you can purchase from wandering vendors, or you might be rewarded with rare perks in battle- if you're skilled enough.

 
New Survivors:
Save and gather new survivors to aid you on your runs.  Find and recruit 7 new survivors, including a genius inventor,  and a powerful grand witch.

<h3>Plays Nice with Others </h3>
<p>We made the Genki Arcade app to be truly simple to use, but for those that need more complexity you’ll be happy to know that ShadowCast is compatible with popular professional capture card applications such as Open Broadcaster Software (OBS), Streamlabs OBS, XSplit, and much more. This will allow you to capture video with detailed customizations and even overlay various webcam feeds, graphics, and animations.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1611658216/qghn6gmbuhnwtoz3xqpy.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>It's pretty much compatible with everything you throw at it</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3>Begin Your Career as an Influencer</h3>
<p>Ultimately the main reason for anyone to capture video is so that they can share it with the world. ShadowCast can easily upload your previously recorded or edited videos and even stream live to your favorite platform - whether your team Twitch, YouTube, or FaceBook, we got you covered.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1611802518/mrkgfaqucbsvsi6kcbt2.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>To maximize compatibility across as many platforms as possible, we’ve disguised ShadowCast as a webcam so that it can do a few more party tricks. This means it can actually be selected as a webcam under many typical apps popular today thanks to all the remote working, including Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and FaceTime - and further even supports video players like QuickTime and VLC if you don’t have our app installed.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Video Chat Your Gameplay</h3>
<p>This allows you to not only share your gameplay live with anyone, but you can actually play with your friends and see them on split screen just as if you were playing in couch co-op mode in-person.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>You can play any of your favorite games in split-screen even without being on a couch</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3>Don’t Settle for a Weak Webcam</h3>
<p>As an additional benefit, ShadowCast works with all HDMI output devices beyond gaming consoles, including better cameras.  This means you can upgrade your video conference by swapping out your poor built-in webcam for most digital cameras, including DSLRs, camcorders, and action cameras - as long as it supports HDMI out (some cameras require a HDMI-mini/micro converter).  No more grainy, low resolution videos with poor lighting. </p>

<p>We actually had the idea of ShadowCast back in 2019 and started to collaborate with  manufacturers of the top video streaming and capture card brands. The timing was a bit too early as the components needed were overly expensive and had originally intended to make a Super Dock. Since then, we've refined the idea, dived into software and made something that we're quite excited to share here.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1611658792/z1uve1fdgkgojm27najt.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Here's also a video showcasing the latency between a TV and ShadowCast. We setup a powered HDMI splitter to show the screens simultaneously with the same baseline:</p>

As an additional benefit, ShadowCast works with all HDMI output devices beyond gaming consoles, including better cameras.  This means you can upgrade your video conference by swapping out your poor built-in webcam for most digital cameras, including DSLRs, camcorders, and action cameras - as long as it supports HDMI out (some cameras require a HDMI-mini/micro converter).  No more grainy, low resolution videos with poor lighting. 

Kickstarter compresses these images, but hopefully you get the idea!
 
The Perfect Stay-at-Home Camera Assistant
It’s also quite useful for situations where you just need to see what you're photographing or recording on a bigger laptop screen - no need for expensive wireless monitors! 

A better view of your DSLR in real-time so you can skip the expensive screen monitor
Other Cool Things You Can Try

Turning a laptop into a second monitor

Great for Classic /Retro Console Remakes & Raspberry Pi

You can even maker a Super iPad Switch using Sidecar

 
We actually had the idea of ShadowCast back in 2019 and started to collaborate with  manufacturers of the top video streaming and capture card brands. The timing was a bit too early as the components needed were overly expensive and had originally intended to make a Super Dock. Since then, we've refined the idea, dived into software and made something that we're quite excited to share here.

Might as well make it as small as possible right?
 
Here's also a video showcasing the latency between a TV and ShadowCast. We setup a powered HDMI splitter to show the screens simultaneously with the same baseline:

 

 

If you need a more visual adventure we've prepared a short video showing the 3 simple steps in real-time to setup ShadowCast.

The Phantom Trigger series follows a group of misfit girls who have been placed in a special school to be trained as ""specialist"" operatives by the new SORD division of anti-terror organization CIRS. The games give us a glimpse into the lives of these girls as they train to hone their skills, embark on dangerous missions, and enjoy everyday life (when they get the chance!).</p><p>The purpose of this campaign is to make English physical copies of the game, as well as other related goods, including an Indiegogo-exclusive soundtrack CD, available to fans across the world. Most of these items would not otherwise be available for international purchase, so this is the perfect chance to get your hands on hard-to-find goodies and support the game in the process!</p><p>Grisaia: Phantom Trigger is the follow-up to the acclaimed, best-selling Grisaia trilogy. The first two volumes of the series had an extremely successful crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter, and have been received very well by fans since their launch.

The Phantom Trigger series follows a group of misfit girls who have been placed in a special school to be trained as ""specialist"" operatives by the new SORD division of anti-terror organization CIRS. The games give us a glimpse into the lives of these girls as they train to hone their skills, embark on dangerous missions, and enjoy everyday life (when they get the chance!).The purpose of this campaign is to make English physical copies of the game, as well as other related goods, including an Indiegogo-exclusive soundtrack CD, available to fans across the world. Most of these items would not otherwise be available for international purchase, so this is the perfect chance to get your hands on hard-to-find goodies and support the game in the process!Grisaia: Phantom Trigger is the follow-up to the acclaimed, best-selling Grisaia trilogy. The first two volumes of the series had an extremely successful crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter, and have been received very well by fans since their launch. Both Vol.1 and Vol.2 are available on Steam now, so if you're new to the world of Phantom Trigger, please check them out!While Rena and Maki recover from their injuries, the other SORD members jet off overseas for a school trip. Within moments of their arrival, though, the Mihama gang are pulled into a manhunt for a SORD deserter, assisted by students Sylvia and Velvet of St. Aile's International School.Tohka's the star of the show this time round, but she's wrestling with her own issues – old memories of her parents, and a promise to a friend that she wasn't able to keep...""You're right. There's a reason we need to get back... even if it means crawling home on our hands and knees.""And introducing Sengoku Ayame - Sengoku Ichiru's brother, and a handler at St. Aile's:""If takin' her in alive's too much of a challenge, just get rid of her - I don't give a damn. I wanna see this mess cleaned up.""What answers will Tohka find? She has the truth in her sights...Check out the official Grisaia: Phantom Trigger website for more details!Ordering the figure is very easy - a new reward tier, ""Tohka 1:8 Scale Figure P/O"" has been added (we've set it as the featured perk, so it's at the top of the page!). Regardless of whether you've already made a contribution to the campaign, you can simply make a new contribution by selecting this reward. The figure will also be available to preorder as an add-on on BackerKit, but the discounted early bird price is exclusive to the Indiegogo campaign! We do plan to open InDemand on the campaign for about 2 weeks after the main campaign period ends, so you'll still be able to get the discounted price then (if slots are open). Please note that shipping costs unfortunately can't be combined with other rewards, as this item won't ship until production has been completed in early 2018.*Please note that additional shipping costs do apply for the above add-on items.Vol.3 Add-On/Reward ImagesPhysical Package ArtworkArtbook CoverPrinted ShikishiTohka TapestryHeroine Trio TapestrySoundtrack Artwork (coming soon!)Vol.1&2 Add-On ImagesGrisaia: Phantom Trigger Artbook Vol.1Rena Printed ShikishiRena Tapestry ARena Tapestry BRena Tapestry CTohka Tapestry ATohka Tapestry BChris TapestryMurasaki TapestryTitleGrisaia: Phantom TriggerCompanyFrontwingArtwork/Character DesignAkio WatanabeSD Artworknanaca maiStoryRyuta FujisakiEnglish LocalizationFrontwing Localization TeamOpening Theme""Edge Of My World""Vocals: Marina KawanoComposition & Arrangement: Hitoshi FujimaLyrics: Yoshikazu KuwashimaEnding Theme""A Simple Wish""Vocals: Hiromi SatoLyrics: Yoshikazu KuwashimaComposition: Noriyasu Agematsu (Elements Garden)Arrangement : Hitoshi Fujima (Elements Garden)BGMHitoshi Fujima (Elements Garden)Fuminori MatsumotoBackgrounds & Original Weapon DesignMAGNUMCopyright©FrontwingDoes Grisaia: Phantom Trigger have H-scenes?

<p>Ever since the first creative meeting, the first draft of the business plan, the first meeting with our business partners, <strong>two whole years have passed</strong>. During this time, <strong>not only did we manage to set up working conditions to develop</strong>, we also have, effectively,<strong> developed over half of our game.</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile<strong>, we have been working non-stop</strong> (with the mandatory coffee break here and there, of course), creating <strong>concept art</strong>, designing <strong>mechanics </strong>and all <strong>the bells and whistles</strong> that are <strong>part of making a good game</strong>.</p>

<p> </p>
</div></div>","Pecaminosa is a Police Action RPG, based on a Film Noir concept with a Pixel Art aesthetic. As John Souza – a former detective succumbed to the pleasures of alcohol and flesh – you will explore the city and its unique environments, as well as fight ordinary thieves, chase smart criminals, and even some forces of… the occult.
 

 
Pecaminosa is a dark gambling city that smells of death, sex, and gunpowder. And you know what? Once you are there, you’ll get the opportunity to experience this fictional open-ended city, all the while living through a humorous, provocative and rich story, full of twists, turns and…a lot of liquor.


Aside from the rewards that you receive from your chosen tier, you can also choose to complement it with add-ons as follows (prices don't include international shipping).




Complementary experiences. Want to take home the pot playing Poker and Blackjack? With your help, we make it happen!
Guns & Apparel. Dozens of weapons and garments will allow you to improve your attributes and defeat the most powerful foes…in style!
Boss Battles. Let’s raise a glass or two to the good old times! Besides taking part in an intense and dashing narrative, you also get to fight against big, bad, bosses!
 
    
 

This is no hero story. Actually, John Souza is more of the anti-hero kind of guy: he gambles at casinos and spends his money on smokes and liquor (did we mention a lot of liquor already? We did? Ok… good… just making sure). 
 

 
That is until, one night, he is visited by Charlie ‘Two Angels’, back from the dead. Turns out even the vilest of men got one last chance for a ticket to the Heaven lottery... Aided by a mysterious Dark Book,  Souza will have to help him in taking down his former associates,
 

 
Maybe now, both of you have a shot at redemption (take this as a free tip, Johnny-boy)...

Charlie ‘Two Angels’: A vile and ruthless mob boss in life, always followed by his Two Angels behind his shadow: Vinnie “Questions” and Paul “Dice”. Back from the dead, he seeks out Souza to help him get admittance into the Pearly Gates.
Vinnie ‘Questions’: Vinnie was never the sharpest tool in the shed…He is constantly asking ridiculous and unnecessary questions. But don’t let him hear you say that, otherwise he’ll introduce you to his trusty baseball bat he affectionately calls “Dolores”.
Paul ‘Dice’: The other Charlie’s ‘Angel’. Never seen without his bloodstained pair of dice, he lets ‘Lady Luck’ decide things for him. A man resigned to the fate his dice cast.
Sharleena Bluebird: The highest-ranking prostitute of ‘La Joie de Vivre’. She’s reserved for eminent politicians and the most respected gangsters, however, her heart beats for you only. She possesses knowledge that will surely help you in your quest…
 
        



 

The main goal of Pecaminosa is to have you living the story through the gameplay. We wrote the story. You own it!
 

 
Dress up in gear that complements your gameplay! Make use of trusty revolvers, deadly shotguns, and lead-spitting machine guns to mow down anyone (or anything) that stands in your way!
 

 
But be wary! Some enemies might require less than conventional weaponry to take out. Learn when to say the right things at the right times, and you will see new paths open before you.
 

 

The game is divided into chapters, progressively unlocked according to the evolution of the character and the story itself.
By exploring the scenario, you’ll find more effective weapons and clothing to improve your attributes.
Be sure to build a rapport with people that might help you down the line. There’s only so much one man can do on his own, after all.
 

 

Control your own L.I.F.E. (Luck, Intelligence, Force, Endurance). Customizing L.I.F.E. stats allows you to choose your gameplay approach.
Luck: Lucky guys dodge bullets and find money everywhere.
Intelligence: Lets you understand quantum physics.
Force: Increases your HP, your melee damage, and the knockback you deal against enemies.
Endurance: Increases Stamina and overall Speed. Reduces Perk Cooldowns.
 

 
The player can unlock two perks permanently, depending on which L.I.F.E.  attributes he levels up. 

It is with great pleasure that we're sharing with you a small clip of a recording session of one of Pecaminosa's themes made at Nordela Studio, the cozy habitat of Cristovão Ferreira, azorean musician and composer, that has come to be a part of our team, and help bring to life the original vintage jazz musical palette we had envisioned for our game.
 

Inspired by such soundtracks as Les Liaison Dangereuses (Art Blakey), Ascenseur pour l'échafaud (Miles Davis) and Touch of Evil (Henry Mancini), we wanted Pecaminosa  to employ a sonorous environment that would be sufficiently intense and mysterious, in order to further bring out the noir aesthetic that we have in mind.

Ever since the first creative meeting, the first draft of the business plan, the first meeting with our business partners, two whole years have passed. During this time, not only did we manage to set up working conditions to develop, we also have, effectively, developed over half of our game.
Meanwhile, we have been working non-stop (with the mandatory coffee break here and there, of course), creating concept art, designing mechanics and all the bells and whistles that are part of making a good game.
To complete the game as it is currently envisioned, we foresee a 6-month development cycle. We are 100% committed to bringing you a great game by the end of the year, It will be released on PC, MAC, Linux and Nintendo Switch.

Cereal Games is a technology development company based in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean and we are ‘ceriously’ proud to label our products with the “Made in Azores” stamp. We keep developing serious games (with emphasis on educational games, advergames and health games) but we are still gamers and dreamers too.
 
 
 
Pecaminosa is sort of our first big dream. Perhaps we are being romantic and utopian, but we do like to think that we’ve created a different game, with a singular story that deserves to be lived beyond our laptops and remote archipelago.

Here we are: in the middle of nowhere
 

To amass players. This is the main reason we have chosen to use Indiegogo as a platform.  The number of backers are more important to us than the money amounts (which doesn't mean it ceases to be important to us, all the same!). Our intention is to unite and involve as many people around the game, so that we can show our community's commitment to potential publishers, noting that Pecaminosa has potential and market.
Apart from that, we'll be straight with you, we see Indiegogo as an excellent channel to communicate and disseminate our game, so we can gain access to the opinion of a passionate community. This means we do not see you as just another number, or a simple backer: your feedback is important and we want to hear about it!
Having doubts where your hard-earned cash is heading towards? You can find out next:


Risks

Small, mostly untapped game development market in country of origin.
Unforeseen development difficulties are surely bound to occur.
Dependency on Indiegogo campaign to show there is an interested target audience for the game.

 
Challenges 

Relatively small team: 9 members currently involved in the project.
First game being developed outside of a serious game/edutainment context.
First game being developed where we are looking to build and nurture a community around.
...Also, we will be very very sad if we don’t make the cut with the campaign… You don’t want to see us sad, do you? Please consider becoming our trusted backer!

The first confrontation between M.C. and the leader of The Ascended severely injured M.C. and left him crippled. They also managed to seize the mind of his daughter.

You can also <strong>upgrade your MAG</strong> and its weaponry at the workshop, and discover possible <strong>side quests</strong> by talking to the crew. It's however not required to leave the planet for upgrades or changing weapons - that can be done directly from landing points down on the surface. These landing points also allow fast traveling between any discovered landing point on any visited planet.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1569491537/y58knbsxcmjfp2iqxamc.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p><strong>Here's a look at how the gameplay on one of the 4 planets could look like:</strong></p><ul>
<li>Mission briefing at the space ship, conversations with the crew</li>
<li>Upgrading your equipment at the garage</li>
<li>Landing to the planet, first contact with it</li>
<li>Exploration, combat, bossfights - the core gameplay</li>
<li>Eventual return to the space ship - the story advances</li>
</ul><p> </p><p><strong>Combat</strong></p><p>Combat is one of the most important aspects of MindSeize and makes up the core gameplay together with exploration. Thus, we have invested a lot into the combat mechanics. Drawing inspiration from Mega Man X and Zero titles, the core idea was to make the player very mobile and give them multiple possibilities of how to tackle any combat situation. The MAG is always equipped with one <strong>ranged</strong> and one <strong>melee</strong> weapon. There are multiple wildly varying weapons to be found in the game worlds. The player can freely mix &amp; match their favorite weapons, provided they acquire them first.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1569531103/f22ta0umim0kyn7ipa8e.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Players can focus on either melee or ranged weaponry if they so choose, but the combat system truly shines when using both in tandem. This 'dual combat system' makes for a very fluid and fun gameplay; players can damage enemies from afar and then come in with melee to finish the job. Having both melee and ranged weapons in player's disposal at all times also means that we can be very creative when it comes to enemy &amp; boss design. </p><p>The pair of weapons is complemented with variety of special weapons and abilities, including stuff like EMP, flamethrower, grenade launcher, a support drone and various movement abilities that help in combat as well. These can be found hidden in the nooks and crannies of the planets and some can be crafted by NPCs using scrap, a resource dropped by enemies.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1569491934/yj1k1rozb7oz0xkecsjo.png"" src=""""/></p><p>The MAG uses three types of main resources in combat; <strong>health, shield</strong> and <strong>power</strong>. Health is self-explanatory and is supported by an additional amount of health called ‘shield’, which basically acts as a regenerating part of health. Power is used by abilities, and doesn't regenerate on it’s own; the batteries of the MAG are recharged by hitting enemies with your weapons and by collecting power packs. Every weapon in the game has its own unique charge ability, a powerful blow or shot that drains power but deals a massive amount of damage.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1569531137/gnq0n2lkefeimzvumlhw.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>STORY</strong></h3><p>MindSeize is a <strong>story-driven game</strong> that takes place in distant future, where transferring human consciousness to mechanical brains and robots is possible.

Remember to wishlist if you want to support us!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------MindSeize is a single player 2D Metroidvania game set in a sci-fi universe.The player explores untamed planets and fights against a mysterious organization, which for unknown reasons is stealing minds of innocent people. The story is centered around the private investigator M.C. Fox, who is chasing a dangerous criminal organization 'The Ascended' across unexplored planets. The first confrontation between M.C. and the leader of The Ascended severely injured M.C. and left him crippled. They also managed to seize the mind of his daughter. This left only one choice for our protagonist: hire a crew, connect his consciousness into a robotic body called MAG and continue the chase!Key Features

Smooth and fast-paced combat and exploration
Dozens of different abilities, weapons and mods to upgrade your MAG with
Varied gameplay: take a break to relax at your base ship and chat with the crew
Original sci-fi world: explore 4 unique planets, each with their own sub-areas and secrets to find

Physical release through First Press Games shortly after the digital release beginning of 2020
 We are developing MindSeize for PC and Switch, with other consoles in mind. GAMEPLAYThe gameplay of MindSeize is varied and divided to 2 different parts: the planet surface and the space ship.While combat and exploration on the planet surface makes up the majority of the gameplay, some of the time is spent on the space ship, where M.C. is free of his robotic body with a possibility of relaxing a bit and getting to know the crew better. Most of the time spent on the space ship is voluntary, but required for getting everything out of the story. You can also upgrade your MAG and its weaponry at the workshop, and discover possible side quests by talking to the crew. It's however not required to leave the planet for upgrades or changing weapons - that can be done directly from landing points down on the surface. These landing points also allow fast traveling between any discovered landing point on any visited planet. Here's a look at how the gameplay on one of the 4 planets could look like:
Mission briefing at the space ship, conversations with the crew
Upgrading your equipment at the garage
Landing to the planet, first contact with it
Exploration, combat, bossfights - the core gameplay
Eventual return to the space ship - the story advances
 CombatCombat is one of the most important aspects of MindSeize and makes up the core gameplay together with exploration. Thus, we have invested a lot into the combat mechanics. Drawing inspiration from Mega Man X and Zero titles, the core idea was to make the player very mobile and give them multiple possibilities of how to tackle any combat situation. The MAG is always equipped with one ranged and one melee weapon. There are multiple wildly varying weapons to be found in the game worlds. The player can freely mix & match their favorite weapons, provided they acquire them first. Players can focus on either melee or ranged weaponry if they so choose, but the combat system truly shines when using both in tandem. This 'dual combat system' makes for a very fluid and fun gameplay; players can damage enemies from afar and then come in with melee to finish the job. Having both melee and ranged weapons in player's disposal at all times also means that we can be very creative when it comes to enemy & boss design. The pair of weapons is complemented with variety of special weapons and abilities, including stuff like EMP, flamethrower, grenade launcher, a support drone and various movement abilities that help in combat as well. These can be found hidden in the nooks and crannies of the planets and some can be crafted by NPCs using scrap, a resource dropped by enemies.The MAG uses three types of main resources in combat; health, shield and power. Health is self-explanatory and is supported by an additional amount of health called ‘shield’, which basically acts as a regenerating part of health. Power is used by abilities, and doesn't regenerate on it’s own; the batteries of the MAG are recharged by hitting enemies with your weapons and by collecting power packs. Every weapon in the game has its own unique charge ability, a powerful blow or shot that drains power but deals a massive amount of damage. STORYMindSeize is a story-driven game that takes place in distant future, where transferring human consciousness to mechanical brains and robots is possible. Connecting his mind to a robotic body called MAG (Mind-Action-Gear), the paralyzed protagonist of the story, M.C. Fox, aims to save his daughter Taryn, whose mind was stolen by an organization called The Ascended. This quest takes him to multiple dangerous locations all over the universe, revealing that The Ascended are a much greater threat to the humankind as anyone thought possible. The Crew The AscendedA mysterious organization believed to be behind multiple incidents, where the consciousness of an seemingly innocent victim has been removed, leaving behind only a body without mind. They believe, that the humankind should take control of their evolution and exchange their biological bodies with mechanical ones. The Ascended are fanatical in their belief, claiming that it would be better for the society to cast aside the old and weak, letting the strong-minded continue evolution with robotic bodies, without illness and fatigue - almost immortal. Worlds MUSICThe vivid soundscapes of MindSeize are composed by award winning Adam Al-Sawad, who combines both old and new electronic genres to create MindSeizes Soundtrack.   COMMUNITY GOALSIf you tell the world about us, we will tell you more about our world! If the community goals are reached, we will add an in-game log book, where you can read more about the world of MindSeize, its planets and their inhabitants.We hope you could support our project in the following ways:

<p>For over 14 years, the global cult phenomenon CHIKARA has dazzled wrestling fans with its over-the-top high-flying lucha libre style. Now, we are excited to announce the development the officially licensed CHIKARA video game… CHIKARA: Action Arcade Wrestling!</p>

<p><strong>Why CHIKARA: Action Arcade Wrestling?</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes fans of football video games are in the mood to play simulation games like Madden. Other times, they’re in the mood to play crazy arcade interpretations like NFL Blitz. Both are a tribute to the game of Football, but each of them takes a totally different and very fun approach to the sport.</p>
<p>Similarly, there have been many great simulation wrestling games over the years. We, like many wrestling fans (and fans of video games in general) have enjoyed games like No Mercy, Fire Pro Wrestling and the latest WWE 2K series. CHIKARA: Action Arcade Wrestling (CAAW) takes the video game interpretation of professional wrestling in a totally “CHIKARA” direction… over-the-top, no-limit, arcade action. It’s the NFL Blitz of wrestling!</p>
<p>CAAW’s ultimate goal is to bring back the fun, old-school arcade-style pro wrestling games once found in arcades and 16-bit home consoles. But we want to bring it back in a way that also takes advantage of features found in modern wrestling and fighting games as well... including online play, an extensive creation suite and multiple match variations.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473010198/x5kev23yhgd2ljbwbrjz.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>More details...</strong></p>
<p>Check out the article from iDigitalTimes about CHIKARA Action Arcade Wrestling:</p>
<p><i>One of the biggest goals David Horn, Producer and Creator of CAAW , has for the game isn’t to make a better wrestling game than his competition, but to make something altogether different. “I'm not one of those angry developers shaking his fist saying ‘We deserve a better wrestling game!! I'll show you how it's done!!’ Quite the contrary,” he said. “I have nothing but respect for the awesome work 2K is doing as well as the old N64 and PlayStation simulation wrestling games. I just want to make something different.”</i></p>
<p><i>Horn draws a comparison to what the gaming scene used to look like for football games. “I want CAAW to be the the go-to arcade wrestling compliment to those games when you might be in the mood for a more NFL Blitz-style arcade interpretation of wrestling,” he said.</i></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to create the animations for the game, a flat $5,000 will be used to purchase custom-made animations.</p>
<p>With the remaining money earned, funding will be broken down into the following categories:</p>
<p>40% programming / development</p>
<p>20% specific to the creation suite development</p>
<p>20% specific to online / research / development / servers / etc.</p>
<p>10% 3D asset creation</p>
<p>10% design / UI</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473985121/jjkxpfl2jflvtcdjvpgx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Platforms</h3>
<p>CAAW has been greenlit on Steam. Fans of CHIKARA and CAAW greenlit the game in only 10 days.</p>
<p>CAAW will be available for PC (Steam) and consoles. The timing of these releases depends greatly on the success of this funding campaign (see Risks &amp; Challenges below).</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>The following are features of our game that we’d like to be included in both the initial release of the game as well as continual free updates. Depending on the success of funding, we will be able to include as many of these features in the initial release of the game as possible.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.actionarcadewrestling.com/s/cc_images/cache_895316420.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Cell-shaded look.</strong><br/>This has been chosen for several reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>It promotes the fact that this is a fun arcade game and NOT a slow simulation.</li>
<li>CHIKARA is about fun. This look fits more with the ""fun"" ""super-hero"" branding of CHIKARA</li>
<li>It will be MUCH easier for players to mod and create their own textures/wrestlers/rings using the creation suite edit mode</li>
<li>It is a nod to the nostalgia of the arcade games that inspired it.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>A simple 2-action-button control scheme</strong><br/>Again, this is ideal for gamepad or keyboard as well as representing the simplified control schemes of the arcade machines that came before it.</p>
<p><strong>Hundreds of unique animations</strong><br/>We already have hundreds of animations created and imported into the engine from the very talented Erik Novak, animator for the second Action Arcade Wrestling. With the funding, we will be adding even more - specific to our incredibly talented roster.</p>
<p><strong>Tons of game modes/match types</strong><br/>Fans of CHIKARA will see their favorite match types well represented.</p>
<p>Our planned initial line-up of match types includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>One vs. One</li>
<li>Tag Team</li>
<li>Three-way match</li>
<li>Four-way match</li>
<li>Four-way elimination</li>
<li>Trios match (6-man tag team)</li>
<li>6-man elimination</li>
<li>Infinite Gauntlet</li>
<li>Battle Royal</li>
<li>Cage Match</li>
</ul>
<p>Many more matches are planned in upcoming free updates. But we want to make sure that we have a solid foundation before we branch out to make tons of match types. When we do, they will all be available as part of free updates.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473010231/mjw0t8bgllezyollexep.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Realistic cloth and Rope physics</strong><br/>Using the built-in physics of Unreal Engine 4 as well as the custom-built VICODynamics soft-body physics plugin, we are able to simulate very realistic cloth and rope physics.</p>
<p><strong>The zany and colorful cast of characters from the global cult phenomenon, CHIKARA!</strong><br/>While we’re not ready to reveal the entire roster, you can be sure that the top stars of CHIKARA will be well-represented!</p>
<p><strong>“Wrestle Factory” Creation Suite</strong><br/>We are incredibly excited to announce a Creation Suite for players to create and share rings and wrestlers with friends across PC and consoles!  So we’re planning on making the creation suite a free PC download.</p>
<p>Wrestler creation includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Image texture import</li>
<li>Body morphing</li>
<li>Moveset assignment</li>
<li>3D Parts (hair, horns, masks, flowing capes &amp; pants, etc.)</li>
<li>And much more</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are many challenges to creating a wrestling game. However, since this will be the third wrestling game made by David Horn and Eugene Tchoukhrov, most, if not all, of the pitfalls of creating this type of game have already been discovered and solved.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge now is time. We are currently working on CAAW part time. The money will allow Eugene to dedicate resources full-time in order to create a great initial release along with the other development costs like animation, user interface and 3D asset creation listed in the above funding section.</p>

Both are a tribute to the game of Football, but each of them takes a totally different and very fun approach to the sport.
Similarly, there have been many great simulation wrestling games over the years. We, like many wrestling fans (and fans of video games in general) have enjoyed games like No Mercy, Fire Pro Wrestling and the latest WWE 2K series. CHIKARA: Action Arcade Wrestling (CAAW) takes the video game interpretation of professional wrestling in a totally “CHIKARA” direction… over-the-top, no-limit, arcade action. It’s the NFL Blitz of wrestling!
CAAW’s ultimate goal is to bring back the fun, old-school arcade-style pro wrestling games once found in arcades and 16-bit home consoles. But we want to bring it back in a way that also takes advantage of features found in modern wrestling and fighting games as well... including online play, an extensive creation suite and multiple match variations.

 
More details...
Check out the article from iDigitalTimes about CHIKARA Action Arcade Wrestling:
One of the biggest goals David Horn, Producer and Creator of CAAW , has for the game isn’t to make a better wrestling game than his competition, but to make something altogether different. “I'm not one of those angry developers shaking his fist saying ‘We deserve a better wrestling game!! I'll show you how it's done!!’ Quite the contrary,” he said. “I have nothing but respect for the awesome work 2K is doing as well as the old N64 and PlayStation simulation wrestling games. I just want to make something different.”
Horn draws a comparison to what the gaming scene used to look like for football games. “I want CAAW to be the the go-to arcade wrestling compliment to those games when you might be in the mood for a more NFL Blitz-style arcade interpretation of wrestling,” he said.

What We Need & What You Get
In order to create the animations for the game, a flat $5,000 will be used to purchase custom-made animations.
With the remaining money earned, funding will be broken down into the following categories:
40% programming / development
20% specific to the creation suite development
20% specific to online / research / development / servers / etc.
10% 3D asset creation
10% design / UI

Platforms
CAAW has been greenlit on Steam. Fans of CHIKARA and CAAW greenlit the game in only 10 days.
CAAW will be available for PC (Steam) and consoles. The timing of these releases depends greatly on the success of this funding campaign (see Risks & Challenges below).
Features
The following are features of our game that we’d like to be included in both the initial release of the game as well as continual free updates. Depending on the success of funding, we will be able to include as many of these features in the initial release of the game as possible.

 
Cell-shaded look.This has been chosen for several reasons.

It promotes the fact that this is a fun arcade game and NOT a slow simulation.
CHIKARA is about fun. This look fits more with the ""fun"" ""super-hero"" branding of CHIKARA
It will be MUCH easier for players to mod and create their own textures/wrestlers/rings using the creation suite edit mode
It is a nod to the nostalgia of the arcade games that inspired it.

A simple 2-action-button control schemeAgain, this is ideal for gamepad or keyboard as well as representing the simplified control schemes of the arcade machines that came before it.
Hundreds of unique animationsWe already have hundreds of animations created and imported into the engine from the very talented Erik Novak, animator for the second Action Arcade Wrestling. With the funding, we will be adding even more - specific to our incredibly talented roster.
Tons of game modes/match typesFans of CHIKARA will see their favorite match types well represented.
Our planned initial line-up of match types includes:

One vs. One
Tag Team
Three-way match
Four-way match
Four-way elimination
Trios match (6-man tag team)
6-man elimination
Infinite Gauntlet
Battle Royal
Cage Match

Many more matches are planned in upcoming free updates. But we want to make sure that we have a solid foundation before we branch out to make tons of match types. When we do, they will all be available as part of free updates.

Realistic cloth and Rope physicsUsing the built-in physics of Unreal Engine 4 as well as the custom-built VICODynamics soft-body physics plugin, we are able to simulate very realistic cloth and rope physics.
The zany and colorful cast of characters from the global cult phenomenon, CHIKARA!While we’re not ready to reveal the entire roster, you can be sure that the top stars of CHIKARA will be well-represented!
“Wrestle Factory” Creation SuiteWe are incredibly excited to announce a Creation Suite for players to create and share rings and wrestlers with friends across PC and consoles!  So we’re planning on making the creation suite a free PC download.
Wrestler creation includes:

Image texture import
Body morphing
Moveset assignment
3D Parts (hair, horns, masks, flowing capes & pants, etc.)
And much more


Risks & Challenges
There are many challenges to creating a wrestling game. However, since this will be the third wrestling game made by David Horn and Eugene Tchoukhrov, most, if not all, of the pitfalls of creating this type of game have already been discovered and solved.
The biggest challenge now is time. We are currently working on CAAW part time. The money will allow Eugene to dedicate resources full-time in order to create a great initial release along with the other development costs like animation, user interface and 3D asset creation listed in the above funding section.

<h2>Major improvements:</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Major improvements:</p>
<p>For this game, I will make substantial improvements in reference to the previous games:</p>
<ul>

<p> </p>
<h2>The Music</h2>
<p>For this new game I have two excellent music composers. </p>
<p>Cesc  Mozota  and Oscar Latorre are the composers of the music and sounds FX  of the  game ""Where is my body?"". They were classmates at EUMES, a music  school  in Girona, in the Advanced Music and Sound degree. Cesc Mozota,  with a  more orchestral background, facing productions for audiovisuals  and  video games, while his partner, Oscar Latorre comes from more  electronic  roots, and dominates the technical part and the sound design.</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>cartridge games have quite a few limitations. I share with you some of the Requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Screen resolution: 160x144 pixels</li>
<li>The VRAM is limited to 8KB.</li>
<li>The whole game weights from 32kb to 1MB. This game will size 512MB.</li>
<li>Console powered by a 4MHz CPU, but despite the 4Mhz speed, games are displayed in constant 60fps.</li>
<li>Limitation a maximum on 40 sprites on screen.</li>
<li>Cannot display more than 10 sprites on the same line.</li>
<li>Only 4 colors! I can only use 4 colors to draw all the scenarios.</li>
<li>Only 3 colors in characters !! ... and all the images are built by   assembling loads of ""tiles"", in this game 8x8 pixels squares (this   technique is designed to reduce the amount of video RAM needed to display images)</li>
</ul>
<p> Note to previous backers - (Where is my body?) </p>
<p>If you backed the previous KS campaign (Where is my body?) and you received a defective box or manual, do not hesitate to contact me and I will send you one at no cost. Deliveries have taken longer than usual, and in some cases it has been able to affect the good condition of the package.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>Developing for old consoles is almost obsolete, but there are a lot of people that still use this old systems and have another perspective of the history of video games and old tech.</p>
<p>Being alone in this whole process, I need support and resources to help me during development. </p>
<p>My mission is keeping alive the origin of portable video games:</p>
<p>This project brings innovation and new fun to the first extended portable system.</p>
<p>Currently there are not many other projects developing for this console. </p>
<p>To protect the continuity of new video games for old handheld consoles.</p>

<h2>Note</h2>
<p>You can play the game in Analogue Pocket (<a href=""https://www.analogue.co/pocket"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.analogue.co/pocket</a>), Game Boy®, Game Boy Color®, Game Boy Advance®, Super Game Boy®,  and other consoles compatible with this type of cartridge.</p>

<h2>Risks and challenges</h2>
<p>It is always a challenge to develop a project entirely by one person. Developing cartridge video games can be quite slow. I need to spend time on the idea, game concept, design, programming, music, assembly, and finish mounting the ROM to the cartridge. After this, Instruction booklet, cardboard boxes, printing, etc. until the last phase of distribution and order shipment. Well... it takes time.</p>

So, yes, thank you, from us all. Mobile scent messaging is extremely new. We would not be here, and absolutely would find less joy and meaning in the experience, if we did not smell the rose, or the coffee bean, or the seascape. Can it really enter global communications?

oPhone?</b></p>
<p>Think about what happens when you walk into a great cafe, experience a terrific meal, or walk on an amazing beach. Beyond the terrific sights and sounds there are the magical aromas. And it turns out that aromas do something to our minds and bodies that sounds and sights simply cannot. They elicit memories, diminish stress, and excite our emotions. Imagine sharing these memories and emotions with friends. This is what the oPhone allows you to do. Are you a foodie? A coffee lover? Ever take a picture of a memorable culinary experience? With the oPhone your experience can live on. Inside each oPhone is an ""aromatic vocabulary"". This is what allows you to create over 300,000 unique aroma combinations. Not only is it powerful, it is also beautifully designed and will look great wherever you decide to put it.</p>

<p>David Edwards teaches a class at Harvard called “How to
Create Things and Have Them Matter”. The class is commonly oversubscribed, as
it brings together students from a variety of disciplines to focus on realizing blue sky dreams. Rachel Field, a mechanical engineering undergrad, signed up for
the class in 2012, never thinking she’d be launching a commercial product with
her professor 2 years later. David encouraged Rachel and her classmates to think about creating a virtual world of aroma. The idea evolved over the summer in Paris. </p>
<p>After she graduated in 2012, Rachel moved to Paris with her Harvard classmate Amy Yin to continue work on developing the oPhone with David. Designers Baptiste Viala
and Laurent Milon of Studio Milimetre joined the project shortly thereafter. By the next spring a first oPhone, a small device able to generate just a few aromas, was exhibited at David's Laboratoire in Paris. This was a good start as a
proof-of-concept, but there was still more work to do.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Over the summer, David &amp; Rachel figured out the key to eventually making a much more powerful oPhone, one that would ultimately be able to reproduce any aroma, and be carried in your pocket. With the ""oChip"" in hand, they worked with Laurent and Baptiste to create a second oPhone for David's talk at the Wired conference in London in October of 2013. See <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/17/le-laboratoires-ophone-is-a-smartphone-for-the-nose-that-knows/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tech Crunch</a> review. </span></p>
<p>The oPhone DUO is our first commercial oPhone. It contains a set of revolutionary oChips inside of it. We made this first oPhone for a table or countertop.  </p>
<p><b></b></p><p></p><p></p><p><b>How it Works</b></p>
<p>The oPhone DUO is able to diffuse over 300,000 unique
aromas thanks to the small, inexpensive circular cartridges we call oChips, that fit inside the device. The oPhone DUO works with 8 oChips and each oChip contains 4 aromas - so the oPhone DUO works with 32 primitive aromas. They last for hundreds of uses, sort of like link cartridges, but for aroma. You can swap them in and out and capture any scent for which we have designed an oChip. And while we are starting with oChip families (what we call ""aromatic vocabularies"") around specific foodie and coffee experiences, we will soon be diversifying these in exciting ways. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Using oSnap with oPhone is like using an aroma palette with a paintbrush and canvas. You will want to try your hand at it, or as we say, ""aroma doodle"". And with the oPhone, you'll quickly get the hang of how it all works. </span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/652672/files/20140616073833-oPhone_website.jpg?1402929513"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>Past Attempts at Aromatic
Communication</b></p>
<p>Smell-O-Vision, Odorama, iSmell... There is a landfill
somewhere filled with all the products that have miserably failed in their quest
to deliver a high quality aromatic communication experience. So
much so that Google launched an April Fool’s product, just before our first oPhone exhibition, called ""Google Nose"". Actually, it's interesting to see how much things have changed in 2 years from when Google published their great <a href=""https://www.google.com/landing/nose/index.html#video"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a> and <a href=""http://www.fastcodesign.com/3031865/harvard-professor-to-send-the-worlds-first-scent-message-across-the-pond"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">now</a>.</p><p>So why have the others failed?</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The challenge with aromas is that they linger and diffuse, stick to your clothes, and don't rapidly dissipate. If we share with you the aroma of a freshly peeled orange, it is very hard to quickly share with you the aroma of a terrific espresso, then a moist chocolate cake without creating a single orange/espresso/chocolate aroma cloud. Aromas are great environment creators. They are, however, less adapted to delivering complex messages than audiovisual signals (pictures, words, sounds...)</span><br/></p><p>With the oPhone, this has changed. The oPhone delivers very small volumes of aroma, in rapid sequences, and never delivers more than you need to identify the aroma. There are other great things about the oPhone (long-lasting inexpensive cartridges, broad range of aromas, etc.), but the ability to deliver ""aroma words"" is especially key,  Here is why.</p><p>Think about the way we communicate. We start with words. From these we build sentences, paragraphs, essays, etc. Each word comes and goes.  One sentence leads to the next, and so on. We experience aromas this way, too, a<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">s when we eat a great meal, or move through a food market, or walk outside on a summer day. But until the oPhone, we could not have or share that experience in our electronic communications. Now we can. </span></p><p>Experiencing an aroma with the oPhone is something like smelling a flower. Except that you experience the aromas only if you want to. When the aroma message is finished, you no longer smell it. This is why we call it a ""phone"". It delivers a message to you, and when you ""hang up"", the ""call"" is over. Until you pick it up again.</p><p></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////</span></p><p><b>So let’s review…</b></p>
<p>1) 
Support our campaign and get the
oPhone DUO for $149.</p>
<p>2) 
Download oSnap in the Apple App Store. Here’s
the <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/osnap-scent-based-mobile-messaging/id883187890?mt=8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">link</a></p>
<p>3) 
Take a picture with oSnap using your iPhone.
Once you’ve tagged that picture with aromas and added a title, we call the
photo + text + aromas an “oNote”.</p>
<p>4) 
Share your oNote with your friends via email,
Facebook or Twitter.</p>
<p>5) 
From now until April 2015, come to one of our
HotSpots to experience the aromas you have created. By the time we deliver your oPhone to you in April 2015, you'll be conversing ""stereo-aromatically"" with your friends in ways we have only dreamed of until now. </p>

<p>We’re really excited about this. If we reach $2,000,000
raised on Indiegogo, we will design and build a 4<sup>th</sup> iteration of the
oPhone that is smaller and portable. Help us reach this goal so we can bring
you a more personal and more powerful oPhone that fits in your pocket!</p>
<p><b>$5,000,000 – The
Aromatic Camera</b></p>
<p>This is what we’re really excited about. Imagine a future in which you can take a picture using oSnap and the software in the app can detect the objects in the image and their automatically tag them with their corresponding aromas. Recent advances in computer vision at leading universities point to a future in which such an ""aromatic camera"" can be made into a real commercial product. Help us get to $5,000,000 and we can develop this!</p>
<p>///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////</p><p><b>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Why the oPhone?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>We
communicate in many ways, via sight, sound, touch, and more.  Among these is the process of olfaction, or
smelling, and has a very special physiological effect on us.  It influences our emotions, our health, and
our appreciation (or dislike) of many experiences that are fundamental to us -
like eating. If we could integrate aroma communication into the handy framework
of global communications we can communicate better, more emotively, and lots of
things would be easier.  Like buying a
coffee, or remembering a place, or feeling better.  You can help make oPhone a reality by
pre-purchasing one via our Indiegogo campaign.</p>
<p><b>Can the oPhone capture
aromas in the air?</b></p>
<p>The oPhone can only diffuse the aromas that you create
on oSnap. When you take a picture on oSnap, you choose the aromas that you want
to add to the picture – the app does not choose them for you. One technological
advancement we’re excited to implement when the time is right are computer
vision algorithms that can detect objects within a picture and automatically
tag them with their corresponding aromas. We’re not quite there yet, but help
us meet our stretch goal and we’ll get there!</p>
<p><b>Why is it
launching over a whole year?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Aromatic communication, in the
sense we imagine it, is very new. We tend to think today of aromas as sensual
environments that enclose us, remain with us, and in a way define a space and
time. That’s not how we think of aromas. We are interested in aromas as words,
sentences, and paragraphs.  We are
interested in being able to deliver many aromas over a short period of time and
by this to communicate in a way that is similar to how we communicate with
sounds and images.  It actually takes
just a few seconds to identify an aroma. Eventually our olfactory receptors
saturate. So our noses are really well designed for “aroma tweets” and we want
to see how people adapt to this idea. We are bringing this technology for free
to people and will be watching, listening, following reactions and designing
our devices, our vocabularies, our platform to make this work.  We finally want the platform that emerges in
2015 to be one that we really do use.  </p>
<p><b>Will I be able
to send or receive “any” scent or scent composition?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Yes,
eventually. Right now you will only have a “Foodie” vocabulary on your oSnap
app.  By October 2014 you will be able to
choose other vocabularies, notably a great coffee vocabulary or two.  Then by 2015 there will be many others.  You will also eventually be able to design
your own vocabulary and get us to make whatever you like.  </p>
<p><b>What will this
ultimately be (or mean to electronic communications)?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>We
will integrate oNotes into our communications just like we do images and movies
today.  Sometimes we share a photo all by
itself.  We’ll do this with aromas,
too.  Media forms with have oNotes.  Like, oBooks, oSongs, oFilms.  Any tweet, any email, any electronic
communication that touches on a subject with aromatic content, will simply be
better expressed, with an oNote.  </p>
<p><b>Can anything bad
happen to me (like, can I now receive a bad aroma)?</b></p>
<p>Nobody
can send you a scent you do not wish to perceive.  Why? 
You need to have placed inside your oPhone the aroma cartridges (oChips)
with the very aroma you are looking to avoid. 
That is, you choose your aroma vocabulary, and if someone sends you an
oNote with a different aroma vocabulary, you simply do not smell it. </p><p><b>Who are you guys?</b></p><p><em>We are a team of creators working to bring olfactory wonder to mobile messaging.

We are delighted to announce that, with over 10,000 oNotes created, shared, and experienced during our summer Indiegogo sprint, and far more global enthusiasm than we could have hoped for (we had over 80,000 views of our oPhone video alone), we are, now, getting ready for the beta launch. So, yes, thank you, from us all. Mobile scent messaging is extremely new. We would not be here, and absolutely would find less joy and meaning in the experience, if we did not smell the rose, or the coffee bean, or the seascape. Can it really enter global communications? In the beta phase (starts November 1), we promise you will begin to see how. Please follow the oNotes revolution at www.oNotes.com -- and, meanwhile, enjoy this last glimpse of our alpha launch. This video, taken during a Saturday afternoon at the American Natural History Museum in July, will give so many of you, who have not yet experienced oPhone, a sense of the viral pleasure of it. And come to Café ArtScience (www.cafeartscience.com) from November to experience it yourself.The oPhone TeamVideo Credit: Raphael EdwardsWhat is the oPhone?The oPhone is a revolutionary device that, in
combination with our free iPhone app “oSnap”, allows you to
send and receive electronic aroma messages. Think of it as a kind of telephone for
aromas. With the oPhone, you can now bring complex scent texting into your mobile messaging life, and share sensory experience with anyone, anywhere. 
Click here on your iPhone to download oSnap for free from the Apple App Store.Why would I want an
oPhone?
Think about what happens when you walk into a great cafe, experience a terrific meal, or walk on an amazing beach. Beyond the terrific sights and sounds there are the magical aromas. And it turns out that aromas do something to our minds and bodies that sounds and sights simply cannot. They elicit memories, diminish stress, and excite our emotions. Imagine sharing these memories and emotions with friends. This is what the oPhone allows you to do. Are you a foodie? A coffee lover? Ever take a picture of a memorable culinary experience? With the oPhone your experience can live on. Inside each oPhone is an ""aromatic vocabulary"". This is what allows you to create over 300,000 unique aroma combinations. Not only is it powerful, it is also beautifully designed and will look great wherever you decide to put it.
What’s in it for me?

During our Indiegogo campaign, the oPhone DUO is available
for a reduced price - $149 rather than $199 for commercial launch next year.

We are offering free shipping to first supporters! (See details on individual perks)

This is Thomas Edison
stuff, and you’ll be among the first in the world to try this!


With your support, we’ll be able to launch our tooling /
first full production run and get these into your hands so we can get your
feedback on how we can do an even better job of capturing and sharing the world
around us.History of the oPhone
David Edwards teaches a class at Harvard called “How to
Create Things and Have Them Matter”. The class is commonly oversubscribed, as
it brings together students from a variety of disciplines to focus on realizing blue sky dreams. Rachel Field, a mechanical engineering undergrad, signed up for
the class in 2012, never thinking she’d be launching a commercial product with
her professor 2 years later. David encouraged Rachel and her classmates to think about creating a virtual world of aroma. The idea evolved over the summer in Paris. 
After she graduated in 2012, Rachel moved to Paris with her Harvard classmate Amy Yin to continue work on developing the oPhone with David. Designers Baptiste Viala
and Laurent Milon of Studio Milimetre joined the project shortly thereafter. By the next spring a first oPhone, a small device able to generate just a few aromas, was exhibited at David's Laboratoire in Paris. This was a good start as a
proof-of-concept, but there was still more work to do.
Over the summer, David & Rachel figured out the key to eventually making a much more powerful oPhone, one that would ultimately be able to reproduce any aroma, and be carried in your pocket. With the ""oChip"" in hand, they worked with Laurent and Baptiste to create a second oPhone for David's talk at the Wired conference in London in October of 2013. See Tech Crunch review. 
The oPhone DUO is our first commercial oPhone. It contains a set of revolutionary oChips inside of it. We made this first oPhone for a table or countertop.  
How it Works
The oPhone DUO is able to diffuse over 300,000 unique
aromas thanks to the small, inexpensive circular cartridges we call oChips, that fit inside the device. The oPhone DUO works with 8 oChips and each oChip contains 4 aromas - so the oPhone DUO works with 32 primitive aromas. They last for hundreds of uses, sort of like link cartridges, but for aroma. You can swap them in and out and capture any scent for which we have designed an oChip. And while we are starting with oChip families (what we call ""aromatic vocabularies"") around specific foodie and coffee experiences, we will soon be diversifying these in exciting ways. Using oSnap with oPhone is like using an aroma palette with a paintbrush and canvas. You will want to try your hand at it, or as we say, ""aroma doodle"". And with the oPhone, you'll quickly get the hang of how it all works. Past Attempts at Aromatic
Communication
Smell-O-Vision, Odorama, iSmell... There is a landfill
somewhere filled with all the products that have miserably failed in their quest
to deliver a high quality aromatic communication experience. So
much so that Google launched an April Fool’s product, just before our first oPhone exhibition, called ""Google Nose"". Actually, it's interesting to see how much things have changed in 2 years from when Google published their great video and now.So why have the others failed?
The challenge with aromas is that they linger and diffuse, stick to your clothes, and don't rapidly dissipate. If we share with you the aroma of a freshly peeled orange, it is very hard to quickly share with you the aroma of a terrific espresso, then a moist chocolate cake without creating a single orange/espresso/chocolate aroma cloud. Aromas are great environment creators. They are, however, less adapted to delivering complex messages than audiovisual signals (pictures, words, sounds...)With the oPhone, this has changed. The oPhone delivers very small volumes of aroma, in rapid sequences, and never delivers more than you need to identify the aroma. There are other great things about the oPhone (long-lasting inexpensive cartridges, broad range of aromas, etc.), but the ability to deliver ""aroma words"" is especially key,  Here is why.Think about the way we communicate. We start with words. From these we build sentences, paragraphs, essays, etc. Each word comes and goes.  One sentence leads to the next, and so on. We experience aromas this way, too, as when we eat a great meal, or move through a food market, or walk outside on a summer day. But until the oPhone, we could not have or share that experience in our electronic communications. Now we can. Experiencing an aroma with the oPhone is something like smelling a flower. Except that you experience the aromas only if you want to. When the aroma message is finished, you no longer smell it. This is why we call it a ""phone"". It delivers a message to you, and when you ""hang up"", the ""call"" is over. Until you pick it up again.//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////So let’s review…
1) 
Support our campaign and get the
oPhone DUO for $149.
2) 
Download oSnap in the Apple App Store. Here’s
the link
3) 
Take a picture with oSnap using your iPhone.
Once you’ve tagged that picture with aromas and added a title, we call the
photo + text + aromas an “oNote”.
4) 
Share your oNote with your friends via email,
Facebook or Twitter.
5) 
From now until April 2015, come to one of our
HotSpots to experience the aromas you have created. By the time we deliver your oPhone to you in April 2015, you'll be conversing ""stereo-aromatically"" with your friends in ways we have only dreamed of until now. 
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////STRETCH GOALS
$300,000 – New Sets
of Aromas
We will crowdsource the development of a new aromatic
vocabulary. If you’re passionate about aromas, help us reach this goal and tell
us what aromas you want us to include in the next oChips!
$2,000,000 – oPhone
4.0
We’re really excited about this. If we reach $2,000,000
raised on Indiegogo, we will design and build a 4th iteration of the
oPhone that is smaller and portable. Help us reach this goal so we can bring
you a more personal and more powerful oPhone that fits in your pocket!
$5,000,000 – The
Aromatic Camera
This is what we’re really excited about. Imagine a future in which you can take a picture using oSnap and the software in the app can detect the objects in the image and their automatically tag them with their corresponding aromas. Recent advances in computer vision at leading universities point to a future in which such an ""aromatic camera"" can be made into a real commercial product. Help us get to $5,000,000 and we can develop this!
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS


Why the oPhone?

We
communicate in many ways, via sight, sound, touch, and more.  Among these is the process of olfaction, or
smelling, and has a very special physiological effect on us.  It influences our emotions, our health, and
our appreciation (or dislike) of many experiences that are fundamental to us -
like eating. If we could integrate aroma communication into the handy framework
of global communications we can communicate better, more emotively, and lots of
things would be easier.  Like buying a
coffee, or remembering a place, or feeling better.  You can help make oPhone a reality by
pre-purchasing one via our Indiegogo campaign.
Can the oPhone capture
aromas in the air?
The oPhone can only diffuse the aromas that you create
on oSnap. When you take a picture on oSnap, you choose the aromas that you want
to add to the picture – the app does not choose them for you. One technological
advancement we’re excited to implement when the time is right are computer
vision algorithms that can detect objects within a picture and automatically
tag them with their corresponding aromas. We’re not quite there yet, but help
us meet our stretch goal and we’ll get there!
Why is it
launching over a whole year?

Aromatic communication, in the
sense we imagine it, is very new. We tend to think today of aromas as sensual
environments that enclose us, remain with us, and in a way define a space and
time. That’s not how we think of aromas. We are interested in aromas as words,
sentences, and paragraphs.  We are
interested in being able to deliver many aromas over a short period of time and
by this to communicate in a way that is similar to how we communicate with
sounds and images.  It actually takes
just a few seconds to identify an aroma. Eventually our olfactory receptors
saturate. So our noses are really well designed for “aroma tweets” and we want
to see how people adapt to this idea. We are bringing this technology for free
to people and will be watching, listening, following reactions and designing
our devices, our vocabularies, our platform to make this work.  We finally want the platform that emerges in
2015 to be one that we really do use.  
Will I be able
to send or receive “any” scent or scent composition?

Yes,
eventually. Right now you will only have a “Foodie” vocabulary on your oSnap
app.  By October 2014 you will be able to
choose other vocabularies, notably a great coffee vocabulary or two.  Then by 2015 there will be many others.  You will also eventually be able to design
your own vocabulary and get us to make whatever you like.  
What will this
ultimately be (or mean to electronic communications)?

We
will integrate oNotes into our communications just like we do images and movies
today.  Sometimes we share a photo all by
itself.  We’ll do this with aromas,
too.  Media forms with have oNotes.  Like, oBooks, oSongs, oFilms.  Any tweet, any email, any electronic
communication that touches on a subject with aromatic content, will simply be
better expressed, with an oNote.  
Can anything bad
happen to me (like, can I now receive a bad aroma)?
Nobody
can send you a scent you do not wish to perceive.  Why? 
You need to have placed inside your oPhone the aroma cartridges (oChips)
with the very aroma you are looking to avoid. 
That is, you choose your aroma vocabulary, and if someone sends you an
oNote with a different aroma vocabulary, you simply do not smell it. Who are you guys?We are a team of creators working to bring olfactory wonder to mobile messaging. Our technology is the brainchild of inventor and Harvard professor David Edwards, and led by his former student and co-inventor Rachel Field, with the talented designers Baptiste Viala, Laurent Milon and Robin Barata, our sensitive nose, Marlene Staiger, our production leader Manuella Passard, our business team Blake Armstrong and Antoine Mahy, and the very special team of Laboratoire Paris. Our company is Vapor Communications.Past UpdatesThis is where we will be chronicling our updates throughout the campaign so you can see how far we've come.//////////////////////////  July 27 UPDATE  //////////////////////////Hello Everyone! We are almost at the end of our campaign! And the good news is -- we're just beginning!  Over the last week and a half we have traveled with the oPhone between New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and back to New York.  On Wednesday David will be on CNBC.  And after Thursday we all go on a little vacation … Meanwhile, at the American Natural History Museum, this weekend and last, over 1500 people came through and tested their noses on various oNotes, from enchiladas to lemongrass tea.  See the pictures below -- and the fun interview. Kids were amazing.  Many had perfect scores.  With the thousands of oNotes people have made these last weeks all around the world, the thousands of oPhone encounters, your contributions, and some emerging partnerships we will start to announce in the months to come, we couldn't be more excited.  About the next phase of the launch, we'll share more in a few days.  For now, thanks again from all of us!David, Rachel, BlakePhotos&Video Credits: Raphael Edwards//////////////////////////  July 15 UPDATE  //////////////////////////Announcing the oPhone UNO! Get the amazing UNO for $1 with your oPhone DUO order during our Indiegogo campaign!We have hinted at it -- now here it is.  The oPhone UNO, what the oPhone DUO is leading up to.  We are then excited to announce that all purchasers of the oPhone DUO, between June 17th to the end of our Indiegogo campaign, can opt-in to receive an oPhone UNO for $1 by purchasing the new oPhone UNO perk!//////////////////////////  July 4 UPDATE  //////////////////////////Hello Everyone and Happy 4th of July!This week, our third, brought some very exciting news. An important contribution just happened, the first HotSpot Perk purchase, to bring the oPhone to a great city in the USA that we will announce very soon.  And while we're super excited to be traveling with oPhone to some of the thousands who have made oNotes these last couple weeks, we're especially excited to be doing it in the context of healthcare.  What exactly this means (scents, as you probably know, are not just essential to how we experience food, they also influence our health, our memory, and more) we'll explain very soon, particularly once David & Rachel begin their little tour of the USA. When is that? Starts next weekend.  Yep, in another week we open our first HotSpot in America, in New York's amazing American Natural History Museum! At the AMNH all you New Yorkers are going to have a chance, from next Saturday (noon to 5pm), to download your oNotes -- and learn a lot about olfaction, and your own noses! More on this next week. For now, thank you, for all your oNotes, for your contributions, and for your support of sensorial sharing. David, Rachel, Blake//////////////////////////  June 27 UPDATE  ///////////////////////////Hello Aroma Doodlers! Well we doubled our campaign contributions this week -- thank you! -- and had an amazing party this evening in Paris.  Students, creators, dreamers from around the world came to Paris for an annual creator workshop. This happens ever year. It started in 2008 with the visit of David's class at Harvard. Then students from the Boston Public Schools joined, and since many other schools and organizations have joined, from Singapore, London, Dublin, Brussels, and all around the USA via the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. Students dream with David (and Rachel and lots of us) for a week. We ended the week with an oNote party. The most amazing oNotes were made. The Paris HotSpot overrun. Lots of aroma and emotion and memory.On to next week! Some very cool gifts are in the works. Not sure if we'll be able to announce next week, but, maybe!David, Rachel, Blake & The oNotes Team////////////////////////  June 23 UPDATE   /////////////////////////Hello Everyone! Thank you for making our first days of our Campaign a success. Breaking the $10K mark last Friday (June 20), we broke through our goal of $20k yesterday (June 27)!Beyond the buzz around our first transatlantic oNotes (see the Fast Company and WIRED articles) and the launch in Paris (a few photos below), an amazing thing happened. Thousands of people around the world downloaded oSnap since it became available early in the week. Right now an oNote is being created somewhere every two or three minutes.  And the content is just amazingly emotive.  We'll have some oNotes uploaded by next weekend on our site www.onotes.com.  So, thank you, updates to follow early next week! David, Rachel, Blake & The oNotes Team//////////////////////////  end June 23 update  ////////////////////////",19.0,2,"1 Campaign

So we see some challenge on keeping all deadlines, if the scope is increased significantly (what we hope, so increasing the scope, not missing the deadlines ;)), but we think this is still a good thing: maybe the development will take more time, but just because we add new features. In this case we still want to ensure that all backer get access to the game. As we can provide an early access version of the game to all backers via Steam, we are confident that we can still hold the suggested deadlines, even we will not be able to hit the final release deadline (because of much new content).</p><p>In addition, as a small indie developer we are of course quite vulnerable to tragic events, like long-term illnesses of one team member. In most cases we will be able to compensate this, but these kinds of events could still slow down the development process, too. Regarding Covid-19 we are not slowed down currently and do not expect a major slowdown in the future. We work separated at different cities mainly in Germany and will continue like that with most of the team. We work since 2 years as a remote team and therefore are home office experts best prepared for the current lockdowns. We are still a quite young team and therefore do not expect to have to handle long-term illnesses because of Covid-19.</p></div>","Our early alpha has been reviewed quite a lot already!

There will be a French version!
Fata Deum is a singleplayer god game asking  ""With the power of a god, who will you become?"".As a powerful god you fights against up to four (AI) gods to rule a fantastic world and its mortals. These mortals act self-sufficiently and need to be persuaded to follow you. But how will you achieve this? Will youBuild great armies to expand and gain new followers by force. Or establish wonderful settlements, improve their cultural value and convince others to join your path. Establish wonderful villages.Fata Deum allows you to focus on building and support aspects to raise a civilization like none before and gain new followers based on your cultural value! Build up large walls and defend towers to save your family from any villains or bloodthirsty tyrants, build farms and sawmills to let your civilization grow and prosper.  Sound boring? Become the bloodthirsty tyrant instead and build barracks to train your mortals, raise lousy shacks to gain more and more of these lazy mortals for your terrifying army and sacrifice them to summon powerful demons!Sacrifice the weak! Summon powerful demons!​With such an army  you can conquer any of these weak civilizations, which believe in education and fun - ridicilous!The more followers you gain the more power you receive to cast very different kinds of wonder! But how will you use your power?Will you support your beloved followers and work good wonders to increase their energy, health and productivity? Will you save them from any evil influence and spread love to further expand your realm of peace and happiness?Boost your mortals!​Maybe? You can also focus on weakening your enemies, by spreading fear upon the weak! Undermine their morality with dark visions, weaken their productivity or kill them directly - the most efficient thing in the end. Over time they will understand that you are the strongest god and worship you, even if you did not help them much (or at all..). In addition, it also makes sense to torture your own followers here and there, to remind them not to stop working!Lazy mortal detected? Send him a thunderstrike!It is not necessary to get control over all mortals and build up large settlements to become the god with the most followers. It can be tricky, but burning everything down (at the right moment) and ensuring the few that do survive follow you would be enough to win the match in the competition's terms; you did not make the rules, right?Burn it down!More the productive character? Show your enemies that your skillls to raise an empire, either by fear and force, or by kindness and support, are outstanding! Finalize your efforts by build up a large monument, which is percievable from every corner of the earth, so that all mortals will recognize your superiority. At last: raise an epic monument! All mortals have their own will, so they will act and evolve as they like - if you let them. You can watch them erecting their buildings, choosing their partners, their jobs, living their lives and only intervene here and there by working wonders to either support or prevent ongoing activities. These mortals are doing what they like to do: enjoying life!Become a loud and visible god, casting more and more wonders to gain their attention and convince them to follow you without controlling their minds (at least not too much). Get rid of all these kinds of micro managment aspects and totally focus on the funny side of being a god: work wonder!Or do you distrust these small minds? Or believe that your glory will lead them to a greater good? Influence their minds during the night by manipulating their dreams to ensure that everything proceeds as planned during the day. Manipulations to build a new building.Decide what buildings will be built and which mortals will fall in love with each other to have full control of which skills and physical traits are inherited. Let enemies sign a peace contract or friendly neighbours attack each other, just because you like to see it, or because you have a greater plan in mind.  The game consists of two main phases

Day Phase: this is where the action takes place. The mortals do their jobs and you can interact with them by working wonders and carrying out some minor manipulations.

Night Phase: this is where the main manipulation takes place, you can influence the dreams of mortals to decide what they will do the next day: build a building, work harder, attack a neighbour, etc..
You can either focus on one of these phases (action or manipulation) or act in both: whatever you focus on you get stronger at!The campaign will contain at least three different worlds (levels), where two different matches take place in each world. During the campaign different game mechanics will be introduced step by step. In each match you have to fight against one or more AI god character with different characteristics and skills.Custom matches can also be played in each world (skirmish), after you have finished the corresponding part of the campaign.The main target of each match is to gain more followers than your opponent until a specific, timed event. While this target always stays the same, the opponents, the general settings and the provided gameplay mechanisms will change so that each match will be different. Are these praying mortals your followers?Furthermore, you can change your gameplay style as described above. During each match you improve your skills based on your actions but these improvements will be reset after each match, so you can change your playstyle whenever you like (instead of restarting the whole campaign).Between the different matches an epic story is illustrated by in-game cutscenes (similar to those shown in the  trailer) and by additional 2.5D cutscenes based on drawn images, like the ones shown on this page.Campaign cutscene: mortal starts to raise a settlement.The campaign lets you experience the story of a young god who learns to lead his human followers and assert himself through them against divine rivals. In a process of increasing challenges, you will not only find out more and more about your opponents, but also about yourself. Campaign cutscene: mortal supported by the player god.His opponents are exaggerated, comical embodiments of the aspects of fertility, pleasure, violence and deceit, which both attract and repel one another. The divine aspects are not only representative of various European deities of ancient times, but also of old, external imprints and paradigms. Campaign cutscene: partytime with the god Pleasure.In the following we give a short introduction of the different AI character:

Related Aspects: Passion, Art, Games, Ecstasy, Wine

Mantra: ""Enjoy life! That is what it is for."" 
The AI god character Pleasure.This likeable fellow can find pleasure in everything, but mostly in fabulous feasts accompanied by various forms of artistic amusement like song, dance and theater. Even the hardships of life, like war, he is able to turn into a game - or if nothing else, a joke. His actions are as loud as his laughter and his colorful soul is nurtured by every being that feels delight or inspiration.

Related Aspects: Cruelty, War, Hate, Destruction, Death

Mantra: ""I will lead the weak onto a path of power... or wipe them out."" 
The AI god character Violence.Whenever you meet Violence, you meet open opposition coupled with unconcealed cruelty. The cries of her victims are only predominated by her own shouts of anger and orders in her eternal war. She leaves no doubt that there can never be a true, durable alliance with her, because she only accepts absolute victory - no prisoners. The annihilation of her enemies and the suppression of her followers is what infuses her with strength.

Related Aspects: Life, Growth, Agriculture, Earth, Maternity

Mantra: ""Sow the seed of love and you will grow."" 
The AI god character Fertility.This goddess feels like the mother of all, caring about every being. With her power, nature multiplies and grows, nursing all beings in her reach to physical health and mental fulfillment. Her love for creation is a quiet one, a gentle influence, a silent growth with only the results reaching the surface. Her heart swells when she is witness to the creation of life - mortal or immortal, plant or conscious soul.
 Related Aspects: Illusion, Mischief, Change, Trickery, Night
 Mantra: ""You are ignorant and transparent... and therefore vulnerable."" 
This clever god might appear differently than he really is. He is known as a master of an astounding array of impersonations. But because he veils his actions in the cloak of night and mist, whispering his wishes into the dreams of his followers, he is able to manipulate in secrecy. His mind is fed by mystery and masquerade. Outsmarting others with his tricks is his only joy. In short two reasons: 
first we want to have a very productive alpha and beta phase where we strongly interact with our community to improve gameplay, AI, balancing and create the campaign (basic budget)
second we would love to increase the scale of the game (quality and quantity) in cooperation with our community and therefore we need an additional budget (stretch goals)
Long form:In the current status of the project we have finished the technical and graphical foundation the god game Fata Deum shall be build upon. In the following month we will focus on gameplay, AI, balancing and the campaign. And that is the exact moment at which we would love to work together intensively with the community! Therefore, we are starting this Indiegogo InDemand campaign after our successful Kickstarter campaign to further increase our cooperation with gamers who would love to either support the development in general or who want to become a part of the development as alpha / beta tester with a strong influence on the ongoing development.Fata Deum at the India Arena Booth (Gamescom 2019).Since our first contact with the community during the Gamescom 2019 and the following months we have already received great input and we would love to bring this cooperation to the next level!The gathered money of the Kickstarter campaign is mainly the necessary amount to repay our efforts for this campaign, setup a proper alpha and beta test environment, create a good exchange with the community and have some budget left over to be able to realize upcoming new feature requests.In addition, we have done a detailed query about general features, the community would love to see and about the name of the game. In the future we will definetly continue with this approach as we want to develop a game for you - our gamers.Community decision: game name? Fata Deum!The result of our feature query taking place in the last months is shown below. We asked the community to do two things: first rate each feature individually from one to six (best) and second choose two out of ten features, which they would like to see in the game most. Community decision: most wanted features.As you can see there were four major features (Advanced Moral System, Advanced Building System and Production Chain, Epic Story, Own Monster), the community prioritzed and - based on these results - we have defined our stretch goals.  The development of Fata Deum is currently funded by the Film und Medienstiftung NRW (local german funding), but the provided funding is not enough to realize an intensive alpha and beta test phase with strong community interaction nor is the current budget enough to realize the additionally requested features. That is our main reason to do this Indiegogo InDemand campaign: we would love to extend the scale of the game!Even not all stretch goal have been hit during the Kickstarter campaign we are keeping this list open via this Indiegogo InDemand to get as many stretch goals done as possible!Let's get it done :) Soundtrack The soundtrack will consist of at least 10 tracks with an overall duration of more than 30 minutes! Furthermore, if we hit additional stretch goals, more tracks will be composed and added! https://soundcloud.com/nlyound/fata-deum-soundtrack-preview-1Artbook Contains a wonderful combination of artwork, concepts and renderings at high quality similar to what you have seen on this page. In addition, we provide you with some more insides on the story and art style! Developer's Diary If you want to know how it is to live and work in the Indie Apocalypse, or you want to get closer to all the dirty little secrets of game development, this diary will deliver!Alpha and Beta Access Get access to the game as earlier as possible! Provide us feedback based on your game experience and participate significantly in the development. The Alpha is accessable now!Fata Deum Development Discord Server Access Get access to current ongoing discussions and participate on the development of new features / concepts directly. Be one of the first to comment on ideas and sit close to the developers!Designer Reward Design a prayer (mini quest) in cooperation with the development team. Sit directly at our desk!Fata Deum Feature Queries Over time we will ask the community to prioritize and select which features should be put into the game via Fata Deum feature queries, similar to the ones we did before to find out how to define our stretch goals. Only difference: the higher your pledge level is, the stronger your vote!42 Bits Entertainment has been founded with one major purpose: to get the god game genre back! Even though Fata Deum is our first title, the core team has a lot of work experience in the game industry, so that alltogether we have over 40 years of game development experience and have participated in the development of over 15 titles which have been shipped and sold!This is the guy, who got it started! Mainly doing all organizational parts, game design and the software development, he still cannot stop himself from getting involved in other parts, too as well!With five years of work experience in the game industry (three years XRebirth, engine development, two years Fata Deum), equipped with a PhD in software engineering and five years of work experience in the automotive domain (where he worked as project and subproject lead with customers like BMW group, Daimler AG, ) he has already handled a lot of different things, but nothing has been as exciting and challenging as this! She is the mastermind behind the world, story and characters of Fata Deum. When talking with the team she ensures consistency and high player immersion and drives Christoph crazy by identifying all the potentials for improvement. Writers being deliberate schizophrenics, Ivonne can be as fun, motherly, aggressive and secretive as our four AI gods! With 12 years of job experience in the game industry (""The Dark Eye - Drakensang: The River of Time"", ""Drakensang Online"", ""The Parallax"", ...) she is our real industry veteran!Equipped with Italian roots his genes force him to design one artistic masterpiece after the next! All city and monument assets he designed from scratch and if Christoph would not bother him with ridicilous minor details like deadlines, they could look even more amazing! Rome was not built in a day!For the last three years he has worked in the game industry as a 3D artist and thereby is  one of our younger team members! The missing experience, he easily compensates for, with talent!Our composing masters of sound! We do not know how they do it, but its amazing! Did you watch the trailer? Have you listened to the soundtrack examples?  What else shall we say? Epic!For the last six years Paul Stähr and Felix Bachlinger have been working in the game industry as composers, sound designers and audio consultants. Under the label Only Sound they have been involved in projects like Stranded Deep, Aquanox - Deep Descent, Pizza Connection 3, Construction Simulator 3 and many more.With over ten years in the game industry (X2, X3, X3TC, XRebirth, Artist and Lead Artist) Chris is another game industry veteran supporting the project. Even his available time is very limited, he is providing very important input and shares all his knowledge and experience.With over 12 years professional experience in the field of graphic design she is creating powerful and clever brands and websites for her clients. In 2014 Anke has founded „kamphans-die KreativAgentur“. Seems to be born with a brush in his hand. He draws us crazy :) All shown drawings are his work! Just wonderful!These guys supported us with finetuning our trailer.Twentytwo Film is producing web video formats in the area of science communication. Most known format is the german YouTube channel ""Doktor Whatson"". Funded by Risk and ChallengesThere are always risks to any game development project. Especially if a new team is creating a game with a scale like Fata Deum. Nevertheless, the most important people behind Fata Deum are already very experienced in delivering games (and other software products) successfully. In addition, we are already working on this project for over two years and gained enough experience to estimate further efforts correctly.Depending on the outcome of this campaign (and depending on which stretch goals are reached) the scope of the game could be increased significantly. If this is the case new team member needs to be hired and further progress maybe need to be rescheduled. So we see some challenge on keeping all deadlines, if the scope is increased significantly (what we hope, so increasing the scope, not missing the deadlines ;)), but we think this is still a good thing: maybe the development will take more time, but just because we add new features. In this case we still want to ensure that all backer get access to the game. As we can provide an early access version of the game to all backers via Steam, we are confident that we can still hold the suggested deadlines, even we will not be able to hit the final release deadline (because of much new content).In addition, as a small indie developer we are of course quite vulnerable to tragic events, like long-term illnesses of one team member. In most cases we will be able to compensate this, but these kinds of events could still slow down the development process, too. Regarding Covid-19 we are not slowed down currently and do not expect a major slowdown in the future. We work separated at different cities mainly in Germany and will continue like that with most of the team. We work since 2 years as a remote team and therefore are home office experts best prepared for the current lockdowns.

Shy crab-like rocks, helpful turtles, maybe even a friendly dinosaur to ride?You must unlock the hero’s true potential and master unique skills to continue their journey.Your magic staff is the key to powering forgotten relics, and will allow you to dash lighting fast across platforms, glide over land, sail above the clouds and more! The game covers a wide variety of landscapes and is built with state-of-the-art development tools and tricks (I sometimes show behind the scene stuff in my newsletter if you are interested) to create vast areas while ensuring a stable framerate.   The audio of Omno features a melancholic, mysterious and at times epic  soundtrack. For the music of the trailer I worked with the versatile and experienced composer Benedict Nichols and I hope I can keep up this great collaboration with the help of the backers.I have been working on Omno for over 2 years (the last 8 months fulltime) and now I would say Omno is about 60% complete. I took a lot of time to nail down the tech behind the game which is pretty much done already! Also all the core mechanics are finished and all worlds are in a playable stage. The main thing missing is putting all pieces together, replacing placeholders with actual assets and adding way more animals, a lot of secrets to discover and overall more love to the game, which takes time of course. Omno is developed by myself (Jonas Manke), a solo indie dev from Germany. Before Omno I gained production experience as a freelance animator for 10 years on many movies and games (lately 'State of Decay' series - check my personal website or IMDB for more). Working for myself in this competitive environment not only helped me gain a lot of experience in game development but also in planning projects, setting realistic deadlines and budgets. I met great people and inspiring artists along my way who I talk to on a daily basis to receive the hardest and highly qualified feedback.RISKS AND CHALLENGESI’m probably not the first one to tell you that game development always bears certain risks. There is always a chance of unexpected problems that could occur and potentially delay the game.That being said I have already been working on Omno for over two years and the core technology and gameplay as well as the rough levels are all there, so I’m confident with the timeline I have laid out.As for the Kickstarter rewards, I have purposely kept the number of physical rewards low and realistic to ensure that backers will get their rewards on time.",20.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Preface</h3>
<p>Hey, everyone, I am Sergey Lipskiy, the author of GLideN64. GLideN64 is advanced multi-platform open-source graphics plugin for N64 emulators. It uses powerful features of modern GPUs to bring you new level of quality and authenticity of hardware-based emulation on desktops and mobile platforms. The project’s first public version was released in 2015. It became possible after successful campaign here, on Indiegogo, in 2014. Since that time the project lives on GitHub. Current public version released at the end of 2017 (<a href=""http://gliden64.blogspot.com/2017/12/public-release-30.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Blog</a>). Development continues, current work-in-progress builds also available for download on GitHub.</p>

<h3>Campaign</h3>
<p>This campaign continues our previous successful Indiegogo campaign <a href=""https://igg.me/at/swrs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Star Wars - Rogue Squadron. High Level Emulation""</a>. Last time you helped us to make HLE implementation for very large and very complex microcode, which N64 port of ""Star Wars - Rogue Squadron"" uses. This time our goal is to decode and implement microcode, which Factor 5 developed to port ""Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine"" to N64. This is very complex and unique microcode. It is slightly resemble the one for Rogue Squadron, but there is no direct correspondence. Developers pushed N64 to its limits to use high resolution and still having a really high framerate. Read those very interesting articles on IGN for details:<br/><a href=""http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/11/10/bringing-indy-to-n64"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bringing Indy to N64</a> and <a href=""http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/11/11/interview-battling-the-n64"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Battling the Naboo</a><br/>One cite: ""Our new microcode allows almost unlimited real-time lights and a much higher polygon count than the original"".</p>
<p>Olivieryuyu and me started to work on this microcode at the end of 2017. I implemented commands, which necessary to run game intro and menus. You may see the results in the campaign demo video. I need to implement remained part of microcode and fix possible issues with frame buffer emulation in this game. It is hard task, and it will require huge efforts to get it done. I need your support and encouragement to complete it. If campaign will reach the goal, the task will get top priority. I’ll complete it as soon as possible, taken into account my limited time resources.</p>
<p>Completion of this task will also provide a good basis for ""Star Wars Episode I - Battle for Naboo"" which uses a similar microcode, but has many differences and extensions. We are planning to implement it when Indy microcode is done. Star Wars Episode I - Battle for Naboo contains some hard and puzzling code. We cannot guarantee that it will be fully emulated in HLE but we will do our best to implement it as well. At this moment only the first screen of the game is emulated:</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Plan for Project Completion</h3>
<p>The plan is nearly the same as for Rogue Squadron campaign. I will implement the microcode step by step. All backers will get access to WIP builds of GLideN64 for Windows emulators. When all code will be ready, I will fix issues with frame buffer emulation and do other required polishing. Source code will go to master branch and built for supported platforms.<br/><br/>Time-line estimation: I started to work on this microcode in top-priority mode and it took circa a month to reach the current state. Remained part of microcode will take another month or two, depending on my limited time resources. Few weeks will take bug-fixing and frame buffer emulation. Thus, project completion requires circa three months of work after reaching the campaign goal. Also, completion of Indi microcode will mean that Battle for Naboo is circa 75% ready. We hope that remaining part will not take long. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We decided to reduce possible risks to minimum and not included Battle for Naboo to campaign goals. Indi microcode is almost completely understood, which makes us sure that its decoding and implementation will be completed. Implementation of any of these microcodes is “mission impossible” kind of tasks. We are going to implement both.</p>

Blackwyrm Books And Games is a publisher of experimental fiction and quality roleplaying games. In conjunction with Hero Games' release of the Star Hero 6th Edition roleplaying game at GenCon 2011, we are attempting to simultaneously release seven science fiction settings that can be played using the Star Hero rules.  
 
We're calling this entire undertaking Project WyrmStar. 


The Impact
Hero Games isn't planning on releasing any settings for Star Hero: only the core rulebook and some equipment books. We are hoping to ""fill the gap"" that leaves by releasing unique and interesting setting books that can be used to play the game immediately, rather than forcing Game Masters to take the time to create their own setting. 
 
Denver Mason's 3rd World for HERO System 6th Edition is one of these settings. ?df?%n?mo />?df?%n?mo:p>

We're calling this entire undertaking Project WyrmStar.


What We Need & What You Get
They're here...and they're not going anywhere soon!
 
Mankind once looked to the stars and wondered what, or who, might be out there. But before they could go out and seek the answers, the answers came to them. Humanity endured the onslaught of a Dark Alliance that savaged the very planet, forever changing its face. Others born of the stars came to the planet's rescue, but at a terrible cost. These savior races have divided the globe among their own, leaving Native Earthlings second-class citizens on their own planet. Former nations have been portioned out among an alien government known as the Co-Operative and broken up beyond recognition. Human cultures have faded over the decades under the rule of this or that species. The resources of Earth are no longer its own but are used to line the proverbial pockets of the newcomers. Some of these aliens spoke of Earth as a holy land promised to them, others merely as a commodity. Some saw a chance for acceptance, and still others sought to help... even if their help is not always welcome. 
 
Now it is the 23rd Century. Generations have passed where the Earth held not one, but many sentient species. The stars remain distant and, for most, inaccessible. It is on the Earth itself where colonists must craft their future. It is on this planet where the descendents of humanity must decide what of their past they hope to salvage. Wonders and terrors await them. Finally, the age of ashes has passed, and now comes a new world of clay that the brave and determined have a chance to shape. Earth is now used or ignored in turn.  It is truly a 3rd World.
 
Will you let it remain so?
 
Discover...
-The rich history of Humanity, including the fate of its lost children and the war against the Dark Alliance.
 
-The alien races of the squabbling Co-Operative. Here are the curious and brilliant F'Trana and the headstrong and passionate V'Sharl. Here are questing Drugan who require death so they might truly live, and the ruthless and material Razneeth.  Learn also of the offspring of the defeated Dark Alliance, some of whom still live on Earth; be they the rapacious Murkot, the nihilistic Glastyx, or the doomed Volvant. And learn how each of these species isn't always so easy to label. 
 
-Study the numerous new dominions built on the bones of the United States and other countries of old Earth. Perhaps you prefer the all too perfect F'Trana Utopian Projects, or wish to partake of the grand experiment of the Free Allied States? Maybe you will rebel against reptilian overlords in New Tianxia, or hope to escape from the aggro strip.
 
-The drug that makes psychic powers possible, and how its presence on Earth is both a curse, and perhaps a salvation waiting to be utilized.
 
-Mysteries and motives yet to be fully revealed in a world that mixes cyborgs and wastelands. A place that needs desperately heroes, but is not yet without hope.

<p><strong>Who am I?</strong></p>
<p>I am Eric Ruth of Eric Ruth Games; creator of Pixel Force: Left 4 Dead, Mega Man Rocks, Team Fortress Arcade, &amp; Pixel Force: Halo.  I have been an independent video game developer for 8 years and have worked on nearly 30 game projects in that time.  My goal is to become self sufficient in the world of game development so I don't need the outside aide of IndieGoGo or other sources to continue my work.  After all, this has been my dream since I was a small child, and I will work as hard as I can to bring you the entertainment you enjoy so that we can all love gaming together.  But now, on to the project!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>If I reach my full funding goal:</strong></p>
<p>Hauntlings is a game designed to be browser based in HTML5.  Each player will have an account that they will sign in with at the Hauntlings web site.  Once signed in, the player will be able to manage their settings (key bindings, audio, etc), Set up a game lobby, or join a lobby already in progress.  At launch, there will be 20 unique Hauntling characters to choose from; each with their own skills to be utilized and combo'd in battle.<br/><br/>Currently, there are 3 game modes available to play.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong><em>""The Cemetery""</em></strong> is a shorter game map with only 1 guardian statue on either side, and a mausoleum at the ends of the map on either side.  This game mode is designed for shorter play; between 8 and 10 minutes.  This mode is available in 1 v 1 or 2v2.</li>
<li>
<strong><em>""The Town Square""</em></strong> is a longer map with identical game play goals to the Cemetery.  There are 2 guardian statues on either side of the map, as well as the 2 mausoleums at either end.  Since the map is longer, game play time ranges from 10 to 15 minutes.  This mode is available in 1 v 1 or 2v2.</li>
<li>
<strong><em>""The Mansion""</em></strong> is a short map with a tower defense game play.  There are 2 guardian statues placed back-to-back in the center that must be defended from increasingly sizable waves of demon babies.  This mode is playable by 1, 2, 3 or 4 players and is entirely cooperative.  Instead of playing against your friends, play alongside them and see how long you can last.</li>
</ol><p>To win your game, you must push in on your enemy's guardian statue and destroy it before you move on to crumbling their mausoleum.  However, the other team will be hoping to do the same to you, so your defenses will have to stay up when you're on the offense.  First person/team to destroy the other team's mausoleum will taste the sweet dew of victory.</p>

<p><strong>Where are my contributions going?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong><em>Computer hardware-</em></strong> My PC is never ""in top shape,"" and has a few peices that are on the fritz, including my video card, and one of my monitors.  I need to keep my only means of game development functioning or else nothing will ever get done.</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Coding Assistance-</em></strong> I have a lot of skill in very specific types of coding, with a very specific language.  However, I am NOT a network coder and I've never understood how to take care of anything server side.  This is where the assistance comes in.  I need to be able to hire someone to kind of fill in the blanks with the things I can not do properly so that the players can have the best experience possible.</li>

<strong><em>Music Licensing-</em></strong> I will be licensing audio from the great musical duo of Midnight Syndicate.  I have had the pleasure of working with them before, and can absolutely promise you that when it comes to eerie/haunting musical ambience, no one on Earth does it better.  Don't believe me?  Go see for yourself at <a href=""http://www.midnightsyndicate.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.midnightsyndicate.com</a>

<p><strong>What if you don't reach your funding goal?</strong></p>
<p>If I don't obtain the full $35,000, Hauntlings will still see a release, but in a much more ""neutered"" state.  If I can't afford network programming, the game will simply not have online functionality.  That means that the game will retain all of its game modes, maps, characters, etc, but will not be able to entertain online challenges.  If the projects funding comes in VERY short, then music licensing will be forgone and a generic production music soundtrack will be applied in its stead.  Also, with minimal funding, the game will also lack immediate priority, and will have a longer delay until public release.</p>

<p><i>""The year is 2172. For the last century, humanity has focused it's collective energy on space exploration. Spread out across the galaxy are roughly one hundred colonies, outposts and space stations from this initiative.</i>
</p>
<p><i>Space travel however is limited to relatively few; many do not meet the regulations or have the wealth to grease the necessary hands. There's also the problem of patrols that go along established routes - officially they're there to keep the peace and ward off pirates - in reality; they've been known to open fire on anyone unfortunate enough to be passing through without the proper clearances.</i></p>
<p><i>But with such limitations, comes opportunities. A small but lucrative trade exists for transporting goods and passengers outside the usual restrictions - although not technically legal and with no guarantee of safety, they make up for it with little to no background checks and affordable rates.""</i></p>

<p>Infinite Loop is a mystery adventure game set in the near future on board a smuggling vessel. You play the captain and to your horror you find out that in 5 days time everyone on board will be dead and the ship most likely destroyed. Suspects? Well basically everyone. The regular passengers are all shady with colourful pasts and even your crew have their own personal issues. The only thing for it is to get stuck in; talk, sneak, search or physically 'interrogate' if you have to - the clock is ticking and no approach should be ruled out... will you rise above it or sink to the level of the passengers you're transporting ? <br/></p>
<p>The game will also feature RPG elements; character back stories, dialogue trees and key decisions to be made. We want to make a game with narrative complexity and some cool unique ideas (sprinkled with some dry humour) - a game that in all likelihood wouldn't be created in a big studio because it wouldn't tick the right boxes. </p>

We have two main targets when it comes to funding. A minimum one that would allow us to finish the game with a good amount of polish. At this level we would commit most of the money on music and sound effects - an area we don't have much experience with and would much rather hire in someone who knows exactly what they're doing.

</div><br/></div>","""The year is 2172. For the last century, humanity has focused it's collective energy on space exploration. Spread out across the galaxy are roughly one hundred colonies, outposts and space stations from this initiative.

Space travel however is limited to relatively few; many do not meet the regulations or have the wealth to grease the necessary hands. There's also the problem of patrols that go along established routes - officially they're there to keep the peace and ward off pirates - in reality; they've been known to open fire on anyone unfortunate enough to be passing through without the proper clearances.
But with such limitations, comes opportunities. A small but lucrative trade exists for transporting goods and passengers outside the usual restrictions - although not technically legal and with no guarantee of safety, they make up for it with little to no background checks and affordable rates.""




Infinite Loop is a mystery adventure game set in the near future on board a smuggling vessel. You play the captain and to your horror you find out that in 5 days time everyone on board will be dead and the ship most likely destroyed. Suspects? Well basically everyone. The regular passengers are all shady with colourful pasts and even your crew have their own personal issues. The only thing for it is to get stuck in; talk, sneak, search or physically 'interrogate' if you have to - the clock is ticking and no approach should be ruled out... will you rise above it or sink to the level of the passengers you're transporting ? 
The game will also feature RPG elements; character back stories, dialogue trees and key decisions to be made. We want to make a game with narrative complexity and some cool unique ideas (sprinkled with some dry humour) - a game that in all likelihood wouldn't be created in a big studio because it wouldn't tick the right boxes. 
*not 100% finalised, but close to it

















We have two main targets when it comes to funding. A minimum one that would allow us to finish the game with a good amount of polish. At this level we would commit most of the money on music and sound effects - an area we don't have much experience with and would much rather hire in someone who knows exactly what they're doing. Indiegogo and Paypal take a small cut by default (related fees) and we would also want to pay for both Steam Greenlight access (so it can be sold on Steam) and a game engine license. Finally, after all of those are paid for, we would commit the rest of the money to hire in additional help with the art side of things where possible. This is not a necessity, but it would speed up production with the aim of getting the game launched quicker than it otherwise would. Minimum Target -- £1200
Desired Target -- £2500If we can achieve this level, we really could do all the things we wanted when we first envisioned the game. Extra content can be added; in particular additional endings and more bonus stuff to unlock in game. The music and sound budget would increase by 30% and we'd also commit a small amount to online advertising as well a dedicated website when the game launches.'Is this even possible' target -- over £2500This is just us dreaming here, but if we can over even our desired target we'd commit to adding some ridiculous amounts of polish to the game.

<h3><strong><em>We all know what a Kazoo is! </em></strong></h3>
<p>A wind instrument that adds a ""buzzing"" timbral quality to your voice when you sing into it. The kazoo is a type of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membranophone"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">membranophone</a> – a device which modifies the sound of a person's voice by way of a vibrating membrane. In this way anybody can produce any sound using just their voice.</p>
<p> By replacing the membrane with a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piezo_microphone#Piezoelectric_microphone"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">piezo</a> microphone the sound can be amplified and alternated. Tunes can be converted into numbers [<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midi"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">midi</a>]. These numbers can control electronic instruments on your Smartphone, Tablet, PC or Laptop. Making such an electric kazoo might be cool for awhile, but probably it would get boring pretty quickly. That is why,we introduce <strong>the iKazoo. </strong></p>
<h1><em><br/>iKazoo</em></h1>
<p><strong>iKazoo</strong> is extremely versatile with <strong>tons of amazing functions</strong>! The flute side is a breath synthesizer. That's why iKazoo looks like a <strong>flute</strong> from one side.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The complete surface is touch and shock sensitive, so you can tap on different positions with different intensity to get a <strong>super drum computer</strong> or <strong>beat box</strong>. Plus, if you hold iKazoo in your hand instead of between your lips, the built-in <strong>microphone</strong> can <strong>record</strong> and <strong>alter your voice</strong>, while the tunes you have created previously are automatically looped. This will give you an unbelievable performance.</p>
<p>A bi-directional <strong><em>bluetooth</em></strong> transceiver connects <strong><em>wirelessly</em></strong> with your smartphone or tablet.</p>
<h1><em>Want to play a game?</em></h1>
<p><br/></p>
<p> The iKazoo's built-in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Arduino</a> platform is equipped with optical and motion sensors.  This turns the iKazoo into an <strong>Optical Game Controller</strong>. So just move the iKazoo around and play your favorite games easily. <br/>The two multicolour LEDs allow you to connect to any device that has a built-in camera, such as your Phone, Tablet, or a PC.</p>
<p>Just hold the iKazoo in front of the device, and our driver application will search and sync up! You will never have to use a touch screen again. Connect your device to your TV and you have a game console. </p>
<p> Our OGACO interface connects your iKazoo wirelessly with your favorite apps. Want to discover the OGACO universe? Every contributor becomes a member of OGACO online community (OGACO Land), a virtual gadget paradise for free.</p>

We all know what a Kazoo is! 
A wind instrument that adds a ""buzzing"" timbral quality to your voice when you sing into it. The kazoo is a type of membranophone – a device which modifies the sound of a person's voice by way of a vibrating membrane. In this way anybody can produce any sound using just their voice.

These numbers can control electronic instruments on your Smartphone, Tablet, PC or Laptop. Making such an electric kazoo might be cool for awhile, but probably it would get boring pretty quickly. That is why,we introduce the iKazoo. 
iKazoo
iKazoo is extremely versatile with tons of amazing functions! The flute side is a breath synthesizer. That's why iKazoo looks like a flute from one side.
 

The complete surface is touch and shock sensitive, so you can tap on different positions with different intensity to get a super drum computer or beat box. Plus, if you hold iKazoo in your hand instead of between your lips, the built-in microphone can record and alter your voice, while the tunes you have created previously are automatically looped. This will give you an unbelievable performance.
A bi-directional bluetooth transceiver connects wirelessly with your smartphone or tablet.
Want to play a game?

 The iKazoo's built-in Arduino platform is equipped with optical and motion sensors.  This turns the iKazoo into an Optical Game Controller.

<h3>What is Townian?</h3>
<p>If you have ever played a strategy browser game like Tribal Wars or Travian, you'll have a good understanding of what Townian is. <strong>Except, unlike almost every strategy game out there - you can actually earn real money by playing Townian!</strong></p>
<p>Most games encourage you to get bigger and bigger with the sole purpose of squashing everyone else. <strong>What if you could build an empire and then start profiting from it?</strong> Townian lets you do that. You can exchange your game resources (Food, Wood, Stone, Iron and Gold) into real money! We call it cashing out. And you can do it whenever you want, as often as you want.</p>
<p><strong>Got your attention yet?</strong> Yes, it means that if you play smart, you can actually earn money. So when your mom/girlfriend/husband/etc. tells you to stop wasting your time playing games, tell them you are earning money to buy them something nice =)</p>
<p>Townian has all the traditional components of a good strategy game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with a small town and upgrade and expand it into a kingdom</li>
<li>Settle new land or conquer other player's towns</li>
<li>Research and build troops, upgrade and equip them for battle</li>
<li>Buy and sell in the market</li>
<li>Forge Alliances, create peace pacts or declare war</li>
<li>and much more!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Current Project Status &amp; Use of Funds</h3>
<p>The game is already in beta stage - it is fully playable and 90% of the planned features are already implemented. It needs some extensive play testing for bugs and gameplay balance - and a final push to complete the list of tweaks/refinements/extras to get it ""out the door."" </p>
<p>So where is the money going? It will enable the developers to take time off from their full time jobs to commit to finishing Townian. If any of the ""Bonus"" goals are met, it will also enable us to add some pretty cool new features and upgrades too.</p>
<h3>Goals</h3>
<p><strong>$1000</strong> - reaching this goal will enable us to take time off work to develop full-time for Townian. It should give us enough time to finish everything off and bring the game out of Beta.</p>
<p><strong>$1300</strong> - this level will give us enough to add a list of our ""most requested features"" which includes: adding a combat simulator, making more buildings upgradable, upgrading the Alliance forums with more features and a better interface, resource calculator and max option, and the ability to create your first town on water or not.</p>
<p><strong>$1800</strong> - if we hit this, we'll hire a professional graphic designer to redo our ""Town"" graphics including all buildings and the main ""landscape"" background.</p>
<p><strong>$2000</strong> - we'd be able to afford to have the graphic designer upgrade the user interface by designing buttons, banners, and redoing the boring tables and otherwise sprucing up the layout.</p>
<p><strong>$2500</strong> - mobile version here we come! This level would enable us to start the development of a mobile version of the game so you can play on your phone or tablet from anywhere! </p>
<p><strong>$2500+</strong> - if by some miracle we raise even more money - it will go towards a huge add-on that we have planned. Though we can't disclose too many details, let's just say it is EPIC! It will more than DOUBLE the size and depth of Townian making it unlike any browser game in existence! </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, or you already did (thanks!) - you can still help by getting the word out and making some noise about Townian:</p>

We are creating a procedurally generated, open world game and we plan to have the first public pre-alpha release within the next month, free for all to download and try out! This initial release will only demonstrate the core mechanics that make up the game, such as fluid movement and combat in a procedurally generated dungeon, with regular releases after that which introduce more mechanics and content.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><br/> Our planned feature list;<br/><br/>   * <strong>A procedurally generated world</strong> of towns, dungeons, and endless terrain to explore.<br/><br/>   * <strong>No hidden dice rolls</strong> or gameplay based around numbers - if you swing a sword and it hits, it hits!<br/><br/>   * <strong>Full character customisation</strong>, with a perk system that allows you to give your characters abilities such as parkour-like movement, powerful magic, or brutal combat moves that knock your enemies away!<br/><br/>   * <strong>Any item that can be picked up can be used as a weapon</strong>, and dual wielded. Use swords, axes, spears, torches, shields, boxes, bags, or anything and everything else as a weapon!<br/><br/>   * <strong>A tactile experience</strong> that utilises the PhysX engine to bring the world to life. Doors must be grabbed and pulled open, levers have to be manually operated, and traps use physical presence to crush and batter the player.<br/><br/>   * <strong>Two separate magic systems</strong> for the initial release - raw elemental geomancy that let's the player release the pressure of the earth and causes rock to erupt from the ground and crush enemies or block passages, and magemancy that lets the players themselves write their own spells into books and cast them once power has been accrued.<br/><br/>   * <strong>Magical items</strong> that feel magical. Magic items will be rare, but could grant abilities such as levitation, teleportation, invisibility or direct mind control!<br/><br/>   * <strong>Enemies</strong> that often require unique strategies. Hordes of zombies that are only temporarily incapacitated by damage and require that you find and destroy the focal point of their generation. Ghosts that cannot be harmed and will move toward you when you turn from them, requiring utter vigilance while moving through their domain. Demons that can only be damaged with holy weapons, and even then spawn hordes of imps to assail those who battle them.<br/><br/>   * <strong>Mod support</strong> in the form of easily modifiable XML files that contain all the 3D tiles, clutter, monsters and items that the game populates the world with.</p>

 Our planned feature list;   * A procedurally generated world of towns, dungeons, and endless terrain to explore.   * No hidden dice rolls or gameplay based around numbers - if you swing a sword and it hits, it hits!   * Full character customisation, with a perk system that allows you to give your characters abilities such as parkour-like movement, powerful magic, or brutal combat moves that knock your enemies away!   * Any item that can be picked up can be used as a weapon, and dual wielded. Use swords, axes, spears, torches, shields, boxes, bags, or anything and everything else as a weapon!   * A tactile experience that utilises the PhysX engine to bring the world to life. Doors must be grabbed and pulled open, levers have to be manually operated, and traps use physical presence to crush and batter the player.   * Two separate magic systems for the initial release - raw elemental geomancy that let's the player release the pressure of the earth and causes rock to erupt from the ground and crush enemies or block passages, and magemancy that lets the players themselves write their own spells into books and cast them once power has been accrued.   * Magical items that feel magical. Magic items will be rare, but could grant abilities such as levitation, teleportation, invisibility or direct mind control!   * Enemies that often require unique strategies. Hordes of zombies that are only temporarily incapacitated by damage and require that you find and destroy the focal point of their generation. Ghosts that cannot be harmed and will move toward you when you turn from them, requiring utter vigilance while moving through their domain. Demons that can only be damaged with holy weapons, and even then spawn hordes of imps to assail those who battle them.   * Mod support in the form of easily modifiable XML files that contain all the 3D tiles, clutter, monsters and items that the game populates the world with.

<p>I would first like to thank you for taking the time to read this campaign. It means a great deal to me to have your attention for the next few minutes in order to share with you my passion for gaming and entrepreneurship. </p>
<h2>My Story:</h2>
<p><img alt='Everett ""Small"" Coleman' class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1204.photobucket.com/albums/bb408/MLGSmall/380639_301034606660852_1520176160_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 10px;"" title='Everett ""Small"" Coleman'/>My name is Everett Coleman, more commonly known as 'Small' throughout the competitive gaming and E-Sports community. I was born in Houston, Texas on June 4th, 1993 and lived there for 17 years. I had always played video games growing up, but until I discovered Halo, I hadn't felt passionate for gaming. Halo was a way for me to meet people from all over the world, develope a sense of competitiveness, and give myself goals to accomplish. Halo may just be a videogame to most, but I believe this game helped shape who I am today.</p>
<p>As I got older, I found myself getting better and better at competitive Halo while balancing gaming with school work - a difficult task while attending a college preparatory private school. It wasn't until high school when I found out about Major League Gaming, the largest competitive console gaming league in the world. By this time, gaming had taken over a large part of my life. I began competiting in online and local tournaments in hopes to one day set foot on stage at an MLG event. I finally made arrangements to attend and spectate MLG Columbus in 2009 where my mother drove me the 27 hours from Houston. After seeing everything in person, I knew that I wanted to pursue competitive gaming. It was fascinating to me that people would travel all over the world from all different walks of life and come together sharing the same goals, drive, and passion as everyone else in the venue. </p>
<div>My competitive gaming career started upon attending my next MLG event where my team and I placed in the top 128 - my least favorite tournament placing, but an event I will never forget. After feeling the rush of adrenaline as nothing more than a complete amateur, I wanted to find myself on top of the leaderboards establishing myself as a top player in front of thousands of spectators. I jumped from team to team looking for the perfect mix of players that would be the recipe for success. Several tournaments of increasingly better placings passed and I began to find interest in not only playing the game, but also in coaching. Coaching was a way for me to share my passion and knowledge of the game with other players. We were able to collaborate on ideas and develop strategies that could contend with the best of the best. I coached a team named Ambush and made my very first top 16 placing, considered to be ""pro."" After this exciting accomplish I underwent several different team changes and top 16 placings until I found myself coaching world renowned Str8 Rippin.<img alt='Everett ""Small"" Coleman' class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1204.photobucket.com/albums/bb408/MLGSmall/405711_177533342344313_2067059774_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin: 10px; float: right;"" title='Everett ""Small"" Coleman'/> Str8 Rippin, consisting of MLG's most successful, storied pro gamer, Tom ""Tsquared"" Taylor, was a team I looked up to as an amateur years earlier. I now had an opportunity to join forces and compete alongside this iconic team rather than just sit and watch from the stands.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This team was a life changing experience. I made it to my very first MLG championship match at MLG Columbus 2011 where we took second place. Despite not winning the event, I felt on top of the world. I competed with Str8 Rippin for a year until Halo was unfortunately removed from the MLG circuit. During this time, I moved to Glen Rose, Texas and finished my last year of High School. Soon after I graduated, I moved to Waco to attend Baylor University. After completing my first semester of college at Baylor, I returned home to start my own business and continue classes online. </div>
<div>
<h2>My Dream:</h2>
</div>
<div>
<div><img alt=""D-Pad Lan Center"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1204.photobucket.com/albums/bb408/MLGSmall/D-PadStorefront.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 10px;"" title=""D-Pad Lan Center""/></div>
Now, I am in the process of creating my own business named D-Pad which utilizes my passion and knowledge of gaming. I will be producing high quality, gaming (E-Sports) related content while also running my own LAN center in Glen Rose in attempt to spread my love for gaming on a local and worldwide scale. The content that I produce will be published on a website (coming soon) and my social media through the sponsors and partners that I have obtained as a professional gamer such as YouTube, Machinima, and Twitch.tv. This means that my consumers will be able to enjoy the content I produce while generating revenue from my partnerships. I have already completed the construction of a broadcasting studio with the help of Gelbach designs - a prestigious studio construction company.</div>
<center>
<div><img alt=""D-Pad Studio"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1204.photobucket.com/albums/bb408/MLGSmall/D-PadStudio.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin: 10px;"" title=""D-Pad Studio""/></div>
</center>
<div>Once I can come up with the equipment needed to run the studio, I will begin broadcasting podcasts, talk shows, and online tournaments (""The Weekly Challenge""). Due to the current position of the competitive Halo scene, these tournaments will be not only the highest quality and best competition, but also the most frequent. In the meantime, I am putting all of my efforts into my store.
<div><img alt=""D-Pad Lan Center"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1204.photobucket.com/albums/bb408/MLGSmall/D-PadCounter.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 10px;"" title=""D-Pad Lan Center""/></div>
The store includes the studio, LAN center, and a snack shop.  I have stocked this center with 8 Xbox's, monitors and PC's. This allows customers to sit down at a station and have a choice of playing console or PC games on top-of-the-line equipment. Our doors are always open for local gamers, but we also aim to house LAN's among top teams where members of each team will travel to D-Pad from around the country to practice. These practice sessions will also be streamed to our online audience.</div>
<h2>My Need for Donations: </h2>
<div>Now, let's cut to the point, I created this fundraising campaign in order to gather enough money to cover the high cost of equipment that I need to deliver the content in a suitable, attractive way. As you can see, the set alone has already been completed. Unfortunately, I am unable to fully take advantage of the set without proper equipment. I am working to deliver broadcasts of the highest quality with the ability to switch between different camera angles, display video assets such as intros, lower thirds, transitions, etc. and a variety of today's most popular, competitive games.</div>

<p>Hi, I'm Kevin! I like - love - to make games. I started all the way back in high school as a hobbyist, back when floppy disks were a real thing and they were floppy. Eventually I got to do it professionally, as a consultant, for NAMCO, and at Crowdstar. Now I hope to launch my own indie casual studio - Wise Old Duck Games.</p>
<p>My first independent title, Lost Spells, is going to release shortly on iOS. This game is a lot of fun and will hopefully bring a little joy and mental exercise into a lot of people's lives.</p>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<img alt=""Lost Spells Movie Poster"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://lostspells.wode.com/images/lost_spells_opt.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/><p>Lost Spells is close to ready - I've been working on this game quite a bit just on my own, but would like to sign up some supporters and pre-sales so I can get what I need to make it sparkly-polished and extra-awesome. Also, I'd like to move forward on other fronts - an Android port, a multiplayer expansion, and a version set in an underwater kingdom designed for children.</p>
<p>The perks represent a limited-time opportunity to get some upgrades in the initial game that will never be available again. There are also beautiful memorabilia at higher levels, that you can keep as a memento of your support during the early days of Lost Spells and Wise Old Duck.</p>

<div>

Wise Old Duck Games on Facebook
@WOD_Games on Twitter


Hi, I'm Kevin! I like - love - to make games. I started all the way back in high school as a hobbyist, back when floppy disks were a real thing and they were floppy. Eventually I got to do it professionally, as a consultant, for NAMCO, and at Crowdstar. Now I hope to launch my own indie casual studio - Wise Old Duck Games.
My first independent title, Lost Spells, is going to release shortly on iOS. This game is a lot of fun and will hopefully bring a little joy and mental exercise into a lot of people's lives.

What We Need & What You Get
Lost Spells is close to ready - I've been working on this game quite a bit just on my own, but would like to sign up some supporters and pre-sales so I can get what I need to make it sparkly-polished and extra-awesome. Also, I'd like to move forward on other fronts - an Android port, a multiplayer expansion, and a version set in an underwater kingdom designed for children.
The perks represent a limited-time opportunity to get some upgrades in the initial game that will never be available again. There are also beautiful memorabilia at higher levels, that you can keep as a memento of your support during the early days of Lost Spells and Wise Old Duck.

<p>We are Envision, an inde development team with alot of experienced people in our team. We are players of old games such as Diablo 2, remember in the good old days when we all loved the old games with small amounts of grinding and lots of fast paced PVP?. Now the day has come to finish developing our game Turf Battles. We as a team see no MMO's anymore that have old school PvP (player versus player action), that can satisfy our lust for PvP like in diablo 2, who wants cast times?, our game will not have cast times, except from the cast times that are part of the animation.

APRIL 14th Update:
we have gotten our first donation!!, thank you very much. Here is another picture, this is frozenland, a PvP area, it has igloos where you fight monsters too. Bosses that are very strong are in the igloos!.

 
We are Envision, an inde development team with alot of experienced people in our team. We are players of old games such as Diablo 2, remember in the good old days when we all loved the old games with small amounts of grinding and lots of fast paced PVP?. Now the day has come to finish developing our game Turf Battles. We as a team see no MMO's anymore that have old school PvP (player versus player action), that can satisfy our lust for PvP like in diablo 2, who wants cast times?, our game will not have cast times, except from the cast times that are part of the animation. The grind in our game will be fun, the game is meant to be fun.

<h1> We Are The Swarm</h1>
<p></p>

Is the internet becoming self aware? As a side effect of development and deployment of autonomous software agents on the internet, a network of self sustaining, self directed daemons has evolved and is showing evidence of pre-sentient behavior. Self discovery, self modification, intention, and other attributes of higher order cognition have been found in the behavior of this complex web of entities and information packets that appear to operate as probes of the global information space. Analysis of this web has shown evidence of larger scale behaviors akin to schooling fish and flocking birds. Also exhibited is spontaneous organization into what are best described as “factions”, competition for resources, and the evolution of probes into behaviors optimized for specific tasks (e.g. attack, defense, harvesting).

<h2>Net Neutrality</h2>
<p></p>

Hyperswarm is a computer game using an AI engine that enables emergent, un-programmed behaviors. It also has the pleasant side effect of producing a data stream that will monitor performance internet in a way that allows us to track changes in data flow as regulations for Net Neutrality are finalized and implemented. 

<p></p>

Net Neutrality is a broad ranging topic, but it essentially boils down to who gets to control the Internet and how that control affects consumers. In the end, it is the consumers that make the engine of the information age run. It's not in our best interests to cede control of the most important technology of our lifetimes to a short list of very large multinational corporations. Some of the specific issues include:

<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Bandwidth Throttling</li>
<li>Data Discrimination</li>
<li>Search Neutrality</li>
<li>Tiered Internet Service.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

The underlying AI system for this game uses the peer to peer connections between players to extract a rich data stream of internet performance metrics. From this we will develop a database that can be used to monitor information flow throughout the Internet. For more information about Internet Neutrality look at these websites:

These are the critical design issues that ultimately make a game engaging and fun or boring and lame. These items reflect our current thinking, but nothing is set.
Resources

Resource probes traverse paths to harvest
Resources available are proportional to the length of the path and previous depletion
Resources on paths replenish
Random drops - paths can have special items that are scattered randomly. Harvesting along a path harvests the item

Path Control

To control an path you must control each end. Controlling both ends confers some type of bonus. A team or faction controlling both ends gives a bonus to all team members. An individual player controlling both ends gets a bonus different from a faction.
At each end of a path is a Quantum Gate. To pass through a gate you must pay a toll to the owner of the gate.  The toll is paid in the base resource mined by resource probes. The toll could be very high to unfriendlies. Transit could be not allowed at all if hostile. Controlled gates could be bought and sold.
A path could have a level based on the levels of the two ends. So if the gates at each end are level 10 then the drops and resource allocations along that edge would be consistent with level 10 play.
A high level path could be impassable to a low level player.

Achievements - Individual Achievements, Team Achievements, Exploration, Conquering, Upgrading
Operational cost - For certain probes to continue to “live” they require a constant stream of the base resource. Upgrades can either reduce or eliminate the operational cost of probes.
Finding upgrades - In addition to a tech tree, players can mine up or find pieces of “software” floating around in the paths. Once a player finds the appropriate  pieces they can combine them at a cost and obtain the upgrade.
Proposed Daemon Types

Player Daemon 
Service Daemons - Repair or Auction Daemons or other practical services scattered through the game space by admins
Dead Daemon - Daemons of players that have exited the game
Dormant Daemons - A node still in the system but not actively played
Control Daemons - Enforcers of level compatibility and partitioning of the game space
Meta Daemons - Monitors of the System. Known for injecting instability into the information space to force evolution of lower order Daemons
Omni Daemons - God level. Special peaceful nodes that new players will create their first path to. These also control experience matching to help prevent ganking newbies. Also have other super powers invoked as needed.

Combat

Players send squadrons of probes. Gates have various defenses such as turrets and shields.
Player can strategically recall probes if they are weak against specific defenses
Probes and turrets have varying strengths and weaknesses against each other. Certain attacks are great against shields, others against armor.
More tactical probes can involve “hacking” and converting enemies to the players side.
Weapon types include: Beam weapons, ramming, being pulled apart by electrostatic force, crushing, energy draining.

What We Need


Same story, different campaign. There really are a lot of good ideas out there and we all need the same thing - the resources to go from an idea to reality.


Legal and Accounting fees. There is nothing worse than running afoul of the tax man. And every way we turn there is another form or other legal document that needs to be filed.

Patent and Trademark costs. The underlying AI technology is innovative, but if patents already exists that overlap with it, the entire project could be shut down by a lawsuit.

Development Plan

The immediate goal is to release the Internet Sensory Array as soon as possible.

These include peer to peer communications, fault tolerance, navigation and security.

 The Impact of Hyperswarm
The perceived social impact of computer games is often the victim of bad press. Glorified violence, gratuitous sex, addiction. You know - ""Computer games are destroying the world!"". We'll leave that discussion to the internet trolls, talking heads and social voyeurs. With Hyperswarm, there is a genuine social benefit. While we really want people to have fun with the game, the impact on the Internet Neutrality debate is potentially immeasurable. One of the real challenges in the controversy is that it is difficult to prove how data flow changes as Internet Service Providers modify their policies and user agreements. We believe our system will peel back the curtain and reveal things that some big players would prefer remain hidden.


Risks and Challenges

Every project has risks and challenges. Hyperswarm is no exception. These are some of the issues we have to overcome:



Intellectual property. Our core engine has to be vetted to ensure it does not infringe on current patents. We have already put a patent law firm on retainer and are completing a patent application. The initial patent search has already been performed and it looks positive.

Scalability. The core engine will not work until there are sufficient numbers of data collectors deployed in the wild. We think 1000 ""sensors"" will do, but until we get to that level the accuracy of the system is degraded.

Time delays. If we ultimately cannot fund this project, the time it takes to develop and deploy would likely kill it. Technological innovations happen with blinding speed and if we can't fast track the development, the train won't just pass us by, it will run us over.    No spare cash? You can still help!

Introducing
A Brand New Online Gamified Training Programme That Naturally Awakens Your Hidden Abilities And Powers To
Control & Design Your Life Exactly The Way You Want It!Best part: It doesn’t matter what stage of your life you are at right now,
this gamified training programme is designed to extract your reservoir of potent magnetic power that pulls you towards your destiny.Dear Friend,
Have you ever heard of Final Fantasy, World of Warcraft, Diablo, Grand
Theft Auto, Call of Duty or Pokemon? Where you start out in the beginning with
practically nothing, then you gain experience, skills, powers, equipment and
you finally become a strong, unstoppable hero to take on any challenge the game
throws at you? 
No matter if it’s fighting seemingly impossible bosses or solving
really difficult puzzles, you know you’ll be able to beat it if you had the
right hints and guides. Imagine if your life was like a game - where you live
an adventure and you get guided through life to take on those difficult
challenges to live the life you want.

Using Gamification As Your Personal Winning Strategy To Achieve Your Goals 


Gami-What?
Gamification is the use of game concepts, game design principles and game elements in non-game contexts. I'm sure you know some people who spend a lot of time on games - imagine if all the usually long, boring tasks become fun-filled engaging games and activities... you'll be auto-motivated to do extraordinary things and achieve your goals.Gamification motivates you to do extraordinary things and achieve your
goals by:



Subtly motivates and engages your entire being


Gives you clarity, understanding and meaning


Take command of your behavior


Develop your skills through play, just like how you learnt tough
skills even as a kid


Awaken your untapped innovative problem solving capabilities.



“The Awakening of Heroes” Is The First-Ever Online Gamified Training Programme
“The Awakening of
Heroes” is designed to help you take complete control of designing
your life right now just by playing. This concept of playing is not new but we’ve
taken a revolutionary spin to it by making it a totally unique experience that
summons up your potent power, for real. When you play this gamified programme, you’ll receive all the benefits from Chinese
Metaphysics, Strengths Psychology, Self-empowerment Coaching, Positive
Mindset and even Mind Doodling as “The Awakening of Heroes” is backed up
by thousands of years of history and science! “The Awakening of Heroes” has 3 game quests:


Level 1 Quest: Awakening -
Discover your hidden resources and power


Level 2 Quest: Your Calling - Live
out your true calling

Level 3 Quest: Power Up - Empower
yourself to take consistent actions

The 3 game quests are designed around a gamification framework - meaning that you'll go through a smooth seamless interconnected process, helping you change your old, destructive and negative habit patterns into new, powerful and driving forces to achieve your goals with ease and enjoyment... all while playing a game!




A Player-Centric Designed Gamified Programme!

To gauge your progress on the adventurous journey in this programme, you will start off with these 3 stats: Clarity, Passion and Drive. 
They are the key elements of achieving your goals and dreams in your real life.
In order to achieve long-lasting effect and successful change through the programme to deal with life's constant changes, we have mimicked these 3 elements. 
You will be going through game quests to increase the level for each stat.



Level 1 Quest: Awakening - Discover your hidden resources and power

“Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.” - Aristotle 
In the very first quest, let's help you gain Greater Clarity. If you feel that you deserve a better life and there is so much more to life that what you are living right now, the good news is - you can change it! Clarity is an important factor to change and being aware of it is merely the first step. When you are sure of what you want, you will know what you need to execute and change your life.In this quest, you will learn and develop the skill to be aware of
yourself with clarity, thus, helping you make better choices. On top of that, having equipped with this skill, you will also understand others better and help you to build rapport with them.What's In It For You? 


You will get to know yourself (your game character’s life codes, roles and many more) in the   form of pictures through the first ever Character Metaprofiling by just keying in your birth date and time.


Learn the universal pictorial technique of Bazi, The Eight Characters, to discover your hidden power and resources. How to unleash the power? How to boost your strengths? How to manage your weaknesses? When is the best moment of your life to reach your ultimate goal and dream?

Detect and be aware of your current level of drive and passion.

Decode the best wealth creation path for you, determine your optimum career direction and discover how you can build great relationships.


Level 2 Quest: Your Calling - Live out your true calling

 ""The things you are passionate about are 
not random. They are your calling.”


In the second quest, you will be constantly firing up your Passion!By doing what you love, what you good at, what serves the world, you
will find the sweet spot in life - that is your calling. In this quest, we
introduce you an unique and interesting story-based questioning technique to
derive your calling!

This quest will also show you how to set goals effectively to have a balanced and fulfilling life. We go deep and discover the secrets of how some are able to achieve their goals while most are not able to.
What's In It For You? 




Write your story to discover your ultimate purpose, ignite your passion and maximise your potential.


There will be step by step guide for you to determine your core values and limiting beliefs.


There will be hands-on activities to know what you really want to do and love to do now by doing your Circle of Life assessment.

Set compelling goals effectively that give you a balanced and fulfilling life.


Level 3 Quest: Power Up - Empower
yourself to take consistent actions 



""I hear and I forget. I see
and I remember. I do and I understand."" - Confucius
For the third quest, you will be empowered with ever-lasting Drive!

Many people don’t take consistent actions to achieve their goals, as they did not create appealing images in their minds that drive them to their goals. 
To reach your goals, you not only need to mind doodle your identity and goals, you also need to creatively mind doodle the process as well. 
In fact, this process ""sticks"" to your mind, constantly feeding you strength to positively empower and overcome any challenges towards your goals.

We created affirmative doodling techniques to help you to unburden your mind, stay focused and drive you to take consistent actions.
What's In It For You? 


Learn how to mind and speed doodle what's on your mind!

Create affirmative doodles for yourself as an empowering tool to solidify your identity and goal.


Use affirmative doodling technique on your strategies to overcome common challenges on your journey to achieve your goals, such as fear of rejection, fear of losing, self-doubts, lack of confidence and procrastination. 


Also, use affirmative doodling technique to drive you towards your goals with your core values, strengths and new empowering beliefs.





/ * Note: The 3 above-mentioned quests contents could change as we continue to improve on them /

<p></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Artifact
is an epic journey to stop a great and powerful lemon scented evil from taking
over and ruling the world. Your adventure will bring you to many different
locations, as you side scroll and defeat minion after minion. Each location
will have its own unique setting and contain special interactive items for you
to use and uncover. Explore, discover, and upgrade with Artifact!



How
do we give you epic, mind boggling, adrenaline quenching action? By assembling
an assortment of unusual enemies, strong characters, and interactive areas. With
different sets of characters and playable maps to choose from, you’ll have
plenty of ways to fight off evil!
















This
retro indie game would not be the same without its dynamic gameplay. We’ve
created features including:
8 Unique Characters
3 Interactive maps
Competitive
     Horde Mode
Leaderboards
Achievements
 




Artifact
comes with 8 interesting, unique, powerful characters. Each has varied attacks
and statistics, bringing their own kind of excitement to the battleground.

The awesome characters of Artifact include:

The Steambot - A robot powered by... you guessed it, steam! His attacks and movements come directly from his power source. He is a machine to be reckoned with.



The Agent - The man in disguise. No one knows his true identity. He uses the tactics of stealth and deception to take out his enemies. Who knows, he may even be watching you this very second...

The Patriot - The iconic symbol of America. Recognized for his bravery and patriotism, the Patriot’s mission is to protect liberty from evil.


The Spartan - Recognized as the greatest warrior in all of Greece, he started his training as a child. The Spartan seeks to conquer and vanquish his opponents with his sword and shield shaped by the blood and suffering of thousands of men.



The Wiz - An ancient sorcerer from the dark age. He may be old, but his mastery of the arcane arts makes him a force to be reckoned with.



The Tweeter -  The core of 21st century media and the long-lost inspiration for epic posts. Social media is a powerful tool, and it kicks butt to rule the world.

The Assassin - Highly trained in the art of death, taking out his enemies from the shadows. He doesn't even make a sound.



Maps
in Artifact use a vectored drawing style. This gives our maps a more
pixilated look, which works well with characters. It also helps the game run
efficiently. 
The
epic maps of Artifact include:
Hyper-Jump - Take shortcuts to navigate the map. These platforms let you jump high in the sky to survive against huge waves of enemies



Booster - A convenient form of transportation, boosters let the player glide upwards to reach and avoid enemy attacks



Maps in Artifact use a vectorized drawing style. This gives our maps a more pixilated look, which works well with characters. It also helps the game run efficiently. 
The epic maps of Artifact include:
Metropolis - A bustling city composed of soaring skyscrapers and cement walkways. The Metropolis is the result of financial growth and the dreams of making it big



Foundry - An urban, indoor environment nestled in the heart of the industrial complex. The Foundry serves in the manufacturing of many different products, including some available for purchase at the Superstore




Sacred Earth - The long forgotten location of the Artifact. The area remains a legend as old as the forest itself







Horde Mode is the main component of our game. You’ll fight numerous waves of enemies on the screen. As you progress through higher waves, you’ll face more and more enemies who get noticeably faster and stronger. Additionally, your score multiplier increases as you kill more enemies, pushing you to survive longer each time.

The scoring system is based off of earning points through a multiplier. The multiplier improves by 1 as you kill more enemies. For example, if you kill 100 enemies, your multiplier will earn you 100 points per kill. More enemies spawn as you get farther in the game, giving you more opportunities to earn points.



The leaderboards will post the high scores you earn from Horde Mode. Each character will have their own section for posting scores and a section for the highest scores overall. You’ll be able to brag about your high scores on Facebook and Twitter. Whether you’re competing for top spots, or just want to show off against friends, the leaderboard system adds a competitive twist to Artifact.



Achievements give the player objectives to accomplish in Artifact. These achievements consist of additional challenges that test the player’s various skills in the game. Achievements are based on the amount of points you achieve, the number of enemies you kill, your purchased items, and many more. With these goals, players can challenge themselves to achieve perfection.




Our
passion for making great games has no limit, but our budget sure does! We
happen to be a group of game designers and programmers who are currently
enrolled as Juniors and Seniors in High School. The resources available to us
simply aren't enough. Should you decide to fund us, you'll be investing
directly into our product. Funds will go to research and development
costs, software, and additional equipment to make all our endeavors for the
game, a reality! We want to produce of additional material that we had
originally intended to put in. This is why we need your support.



Baseline ($4000) - The game will include Horde Mode, 3 maps, and 8 characters. We will also begin to develop and integrate the in-game store and items into our game
Campaign ($5000) - Our game will come to life with an engaging story line. You’ll be playing on a variety of maps, facing an onslaught of minions and bosses! Keep on fighting until you come face to face with an evil enemy who has the ultimate power, the power of the Artifact.
Multiplayer ($7500) - Engage in intense 1v1 multiplayer battles on a variety of maps, challenging you to test your skills and adapt your fighting strategies. Feeling less competitive? We’ll also add a co-op option to horde mode, allowing you to kick some butt with a friend.
Donating to Charity/Non-Profits ($10,000) - If we reach a certain limit, we will donate half of our game’s future profits to local charities and non-profit organizations within our community.
No Ads ($20,000) - Artifact will have no annoying ads. Period.

<p></p>
<p style=""font-size: 16px;"">We are making the game really fun. There
are not just funny comments and scenes as in most of the other point and click
adventure games. Conversations resemble the ones from popular movies and
series, sometimes in a different context bringing them to new dimensions. There
are situations in the game that are like real-life situations and everyone can
relate to. Check the movie clip below to get an idea!</p>
<p style=""font-size: 16px;"">

<p style=""font-size: 16px;"">If you are at least a bit geek you
will find yourself in situations similar to what you have experienced, remember
the awkwardness or silliness and laugh about it. In our experience the things
that you can relate to or happened to you are the most funny. We want to make
you laugh. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/18996/files/20130818081224-Question2.png?1376838744"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""font-size: 16px;"">In the
game, you play a geeky science student Peter Frog using traditional point and
click mechanism. You can interact with almost any object in the scene as well
as talk to anyone. What is more, Peter Frog can combine objects in the scene.
For example, a cup and water pipe can be combined using drag and drop to make
Peter Frog fill the glass with water. Note that the cup is not in the
inventory. This opens even more possibilities for puzzles. We try to make all,
even not so meaningful interactions and combinations, possible, at least
resulting in a funny remark.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 16px;""></p>

<p></p>
<p style=""font-size: 16px;"">If goal is unlocked, we will be also adding another feature to the gameplay. It is called flash forward and revert. The mechanism is simple: if you try something awkward or something that would result in your end, the sequence would be played normally. At the end, however, there would be a fast playback to state before you did this awkward/wrong thing. This will bring even more fun to the game!</p>

The game
still needs polishing though. Some interactions are not in place yet and not
all animations are working as they should. Most of the conversations are
written but we need voice actors to read them out loud. We also want a really
good theme music that we can't do ourselves. Last but not least, in order to port
and test the game thoroughly on different platforms, we
need to buy hardware and software. We don't want to publish half-polished

all of game platforms out there.</p>

languages?</p>
<p style=""font-size: 16px;"">In the core version, probably not. However,
if stretch goals are reached or we find a volunteer to translate game to
another language, we would happily include it. Voice acting in other languages
is also dependent on stretch goals.</p>

For example, a cup and water pipe can be combined using drag and drop to make
Peter Frog fill the glass with water. Note that the cup is not in the
inventory. This opens even more possibilities for puzzles. We try to make all,
even not so meaningful interactions and combinations, possible, at least
resulting in a funny remark.



If goal is unlocked, we will be also adding another feature to the gameplay. It is called flash forward and revert. The mechanism is simple: if you try something awkward or something that would result in your end, the sequence would be played normally. At the end, however, there would be a fast playback to state before you did this awkward/wrong thing. This will bring even more fun to the game!







We have
been working on Geek's Lair: The Crazy Scientist for 10 months already.
Starting from nothing, a great progress has been made and the game is nearly
complete. We have been working hard!


The game
still needs polishing though. Some interactions are not in place yet and not
all animations are working as they should. Most of the conversations are
written but we need voice actors to read them out loud. We also want a really
good theme music that we can't do ourselves. Last but not least, in order to port
and test the game thoroughly on different platforms, we
need to buy hardware and software. We don't want to publish half-polished
product with bugs that doesn't work on some platforms as expected. With your
support, we will make game that you want us to make!

2.400€ - buy professional licence of the game engine Unity Pro. It will enhance performance (dynamic batching), make animations better (inverse kinematics) and allow for some other visual features.2.000€ - hardware for testing and porting.2.000€ - hire studio and voice actors.1.600€ - create theme music.1.000€ - rewards and shipping.1.000€ - Indiegogo and Paypal fees.

We kept the
team intentionally small so new ideas can be exchanged rapidly and we can work
side by side. No bureaucracy, just brotherly love. We sometimes fight but five
minutes later, we are working as if nothing has happened.

We would
also like to thank our friends for ideas and support. Most of all, we would
like to thank all contributors – YOU - for making our dreams come true and
spreading the word about Geek's Lair: The Crazy Scientist.


We have developed a large portion of the game and succesfully tackled with every obstacle we have encountered. Apart from music and voice recording (which we have tried already and works, we just need voice actors), the story of the game just needs completion and the game needs some further polishing. 
Even though this is our first professional project, we have worked on many projects like smaller games (puzzles, 3D space shooters), game engines (ZeusEngine, BaadEngine, SharpMedia) and complicated numerical school projects. We have nearly 10 years of experience in this field. All that said, we are confident that Geek's Lair: The Crazy Scientist will become a game for true adventurers. The only con is that we might not finish the project by the end of 2013 if some major issue arises, or more features than expected are implemented. This is especially true if the funding goal is not reached. But fear not, the game will be made!




What platforms will Geek's Lair: The Crazy
Scientist run on?
It is currently working on Windows and
Android. We plan to port it to iOS soon. Other platforms are easily possible
with enough funds since we are using Unity engine that has support for almost
all of game platforms out there.
When will the game be released?
We plan to release the first version by the end ob 2013.
Will the game be available in other
languages?
In the core version, probably not. However,
if stretch goals are reached or we find a volunteer to translate game to
another language, we would happily include it. Voice acting in other languages
is also dependent on stretch goals.",13.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<div>My name is Steve Pastro and I am currently a Masters student at the Centre for Digital Media in beautiful Vancouver, British Columbia.  Over the past several years I have devoted endless hours to prototyping games for web and mobile platforms and am finally ready for the big show.  I am currently developing an addictive puzzle game for iOS called Light Byte that tests your reflexes and memory by combining the excitement of a shooter with the colour-matching element found in old memory games.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>As a student (and one who has incurred an incredible amount of debt), I am unable to release this game without your help!  While I have been lucky enough to develop this game using an education license for the game engine Unity 3D provided by my school, I need to purchase my own licenses both from Unity and Apple if I want the game to ever see the light of day on the app store.  All money contributed to this campaign goes directly towards the payment of these overhead fees, while I work full time at school during the day and full time at home on this game at night in order to have the app ready for release by the second week of March.</div>
<div> </div>
</div>
<div>I wish I had the luxury of doing this completely on my own, but I need your help!  I have and will continue to work day and night on the project to ensure it's completion, but without the requisite licenses it will all be for naught!</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I am confident this game has the potential to become a hit, and with your help will do all in my power to ensure that it does!  </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><em>What I need:</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>While this project can use all the help it can get, here's the breakdown of where the money goes as it comes in:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>First $100 - Covers the cost of the Developer License from Apple which allows one to publish something to the App Store.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Next $400 - Covers the cost of the basic iOS License for Unity 3D, allowing the game to be released commercially, but with a Unity branded splash screen and lacking several optimization tools.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Next $200 - Covers the cost of various plug-ins and toolsets from Prime31 which will allow the integration of features such as Leaderboards and Facebook and Twitter integration, and the optimization of assets to keep the file size small.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Next $2600 - Here's the big one: Covers the cost of the iOS Pro Unity 3D License, allowing the game to launch with a custom splash screen (ensures a professional feel from the outset), play full screen video, and take advantage of several optimization tools to ensure the game runs smoothly on all devices.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Above and Beyond - Any money made of the game will be split between PR and marketing spending to gain exposure and ensure the app succeeds, and the purchase of an iPad 1 so that I can begin work on an HD iPad version of the game and have a proper unit to test on.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>THE PERKS:</em></p>
<p><em><br/></em></p>
<p>I wish I had more to give to you wonderful people, but here's the best I can do for now:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>$5 Donation gets you: A Light Byte themed Desktop Wallpaper (1440 x 900 pixels)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>$10 Donation gets you: A 3-track (MP3 format) .zip file containing the game's soundtrack plus the Light Byte themed wallpaper.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>$20 Donation gets you: Early acces to a beta version of the game playing on Mac and PC in a password protected .zip file, and the above items.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>$50 Donation gets you: Beta Access to the game via Test Flight, your name on a ""Special Thanks"" page in the game, and the above items.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>$100 Donation gets you: A one hour Skype conversation with me (time and date TBD and schedule dependent) where we can talk about anything you'd like, including how the game was made in Unity.  You also receive all of the above perks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Last but not least...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For the generous donation of $500: I will personally spend two complete work days (16 hours) prototyping a game of your choosing for iOS devices, and do my best to return to you a playable demo (of variable quality, depending on the game desired) in the form of a .zip file containing the entire Unity Project and source code upon completion.  Again, you receive all of the above perks in addition to your brand new game demo :) </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please spread the word and post this link to your Facebook and Twitter feeds.  I love making games but with the money needed to be able to actually release them (not to mention the ominous cloud of student loans lurking ahead) I can't do this without you!  It'd mean the world to me if you could help out in any way possible, whether it be via a donation yourself or just passing it along to a friend it truly means the world to me! </p>

I have been involved with this wonderful game for 54 years as a player and teacher. About 15 years ago I became acquainted with what is referred to as hickory golf and was smitten with it. Basically it is how the game was first played in Scotland and then brought to America. Over the past few years, hickory golf has been making a comeback and taken root across the world. The number of tournaments and players has grown year after year. The growth has good reason. The hickory game is colorful, fast, easily understood and fun. I'm asking you to be a part of that growth. 
</p><div>
</div><p>I
created the United States Professional Hickory Golf Championship to commemorate
golf’s early years in America and the men and women who popularized the sport.
The event honors our country’s first golf pro – John Shippen, an African
American who played in the first U.S Open alongside of Oscar Bunn a Shinnecock
Indian. Both men’s story I dare say are unknown to golfers of modern times. This
tournament day will serve as a call to remember the game of days gone by. And
what<strong> better way to do that than to have the men and women who
teach and play the game for a living pass on golf’s history by actually competing
like  our forbearers. </strong>In its brief
operation the tournament has attracted professionals from across the globe but
in limited numbers. I believe that by offering a larger prize fund more pros will be attracted to participate, even if only out of curiosity, but in the end will appreciate the skill of the men and women who made the game popular in its early days.</p><div>
</div><p>If your a golfer or just a fan of golf, please consider becoming a sponsor of the event. Your contribution is about heritage and tradition. Memories that can be passed on. In the previous tournaments there has been a lot of interest from local and national media. Radio, newspaper and television. The New York Times did a front page cover on their sports section in 2012. By increasing the prize fund substantially, more pros and likely well known pros will participate and make securing sponsors for the future easier. It just needs some help to get to the next level. That's where you as a contributor come in. This can become a permanent tribute to history and heritage going forward for generations to come.</p><ul> </ul><p><br/></p> <div> </div> <div> <h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<h3></h3>
<p>I hope to raise $25,000 to operate the tournament and to increase the prize fund which I feel will make the tournament more attractive to male and female golf professionals, and possibly more high profile players. The prize fund up to this point has been $5,000. I have had some members of the PGA Tour and European Tour participate but to attract more of them will require something with more incentive. After all professionals make their living competing for a portion of the purse. If I get a few more high profile players to participate then that most likely will attract more media coverage and my goal of keeping history alive has the best chance of success. The tournament will get bigger and then it will be easier to get sponsors and possibly television coverage for subsequent editions. The origins of the game will not be lost or forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>Your dollars will do a lot of things which include providing authentic vintage golf clubs and balls for the players, cover course rental and provide a prize fund to attract and reward male and female professionals. I do not keep any money for myself. Any excess money left over after the the tournament has concluded is donated to a local charity. In the first four years of operation I have distributed $2,800 to support military families of wounded veterans.</strong></p>

<h3>Why Do This?</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Studies suggest that the
occasional detour down memory lane can give our spirits a significant lift. Memories, in turn, inspire positive feelings
of joy, high self-regard, belonging, and meaningfulness in life. Today,
the arts, artists, and culture do not seem as valued as in the past. Because of
the incredible technological achievements of recent years, we forget to be
thrilled and amazed. So this is a trip down memory lane and although specific
to golf, it will instill in each of us involved a sense of belonging, a positive reminiscence and part of a cycle that also includes
savoring the present and looking forward to the future.<br/></p>

One of the most common applications of the 555 timer is the astable mode, which is unfortunately rather clunky to build on a breadboard. This 555 breakout board does more than expose the 555's eight pins: it sets you up to run your 555 timer in astable mode with slots to insert two resistors and a capacitor of your choice.

<p></p><p></p></div>","Get the schematicsHello, my name is Patrick Grady and I'm a highschool senior in the US. I'm an avid programmer and tinkerer and love anything related to electronics and computers. This past winter I took a class in Digital Electronics and was introduced to the 555 timer. One of the most common applications of the 555 timer is the astable mode, which is unfortunately rather clunky to build on a breadboard. This 555 breakout board does more than expose the 555's eight pins: it sets you up to run your 555 timer in astable mode with slots to insert two resistors and a capacitor of your choice. This board eliminates all the wiring for the 555 timer. The 555 Timer Breakout Board Plus will cut out the tedium of setting up the 555 timer and will allow hobbyists to dig straight in to their projects.As a electronics hobbyist myself, I recognize the usefulness of this simple device, but also acknowledge its relevance is limited to the niche market of hobbyist electronics. If you want this device or think a friend could use it, please contribute to the campaign and buy a 555 timer breakout board!We have built a fully functional prototype board, which you can check out above in the campaign images. The board is 0.88 inches by 0.82 inches. NOTE: This board does not necessarily reflect the exact final design of the board.Here you can see the Eagle board layout. We will be using the NE555P made by Texas Instruments. For C1, R1 and R2 we will be using three, 2 pin female headers so that the user can easily stick in whatever resistors or capacitors they want to use in the circuit. The power, ground, and output headers will be male so that this board can easily be used with a breadboard. TRG will be left open to allow the user to use the timer in monostable mode.NOTE: This board does not necessarily reflect the exact final design of the board.This board worked flawlessly, so I soldered the other 2 boards with their components. I also figured out how to avoid making a mess with the solder and discoloring the silkscreen.The result looked like this, and this is what your boards will look like (minus the bits of PCB sticking out to the top and right).Astable Mode: to use this board in astable mode, switch the switch to the ""A"" side and plug a capacitor into C1, and resistors into R1 and R2.Period = ln(2)*C*(R1+2R2)Monostable Mode: to use in monostable mode, simply switch the switch to the ""M"" side, insert a capacitor into C1, put a resistor into R1, a piece of wire into R2, and a trigger signal into TRG.Output duration = R*C*ln(3)The only thing we need to get started on these boards is demand. Funding contributed to the project will go into producing a batch of PCBs which will be populated and distributed to the contributors of this campaign. In addition each user will get a short guide for using the board. Even if we don't reach the goal, we will still run off all the boards that were ordered and ship them out(because of Flexible Funding).  PCB & Components: The most significant cost of these boards are the PCB board and the components that are soldered onto it.Shipping: This section includes the postage required to ship your board to you in an ESD protected bag. Labor: Depending on how many orders I get, I may have to recruit help for soldering the components.Once again, this project will make it easier for you (and other hobbyists like yourself) to get started with the 555 timer and make it easier and simpler to implement in your projects. This means it is easier for hobbyists to use the 555 timer and generally makes the 555 timing circuit more accessible and useful to the average hobbyist.

<h2>NEW PERK LEVELS ADDED!</h2>
<div><b><i>Please see below, you can now get a smaller perk of JUST a couple of the awesome Mechabrick mech kits or JUST the original boxed board-game!</i></b></div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>What is Mechabrick?</h3>
<p>Mechabrick is a board-game (launched earlier this year) that uses precision plastic robot models which you build and customise to fight epic battles in a futuristic city environment. The unique point of the game and the associated models is that every part of the mechs and every accessory component we make is compatible with leading plastic building brick brands and minifigs. The scenery around which the game is played is also built from your favorite plastic building bricks, bringing a unique element of creativity to the game.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448877439/ucutqxxgmcqegq3knsen.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>At the core of the game, having taken over two years to develop and produce, are the 22-part precision molded plastic mech models. They are fully articulated and every component is compatible with your favorite plastic building brick components. You can even use a minifig torso and legs in the core of the mech model if you wish.<br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448877392/cztysbv1cumsfuo4imd2.jpg"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/><br/></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px; background-color: initial;"">Playing the game:</span><br/></p>
<p>The Mechabrick game is a simple strategy board game designed to be accessible for ages 10+ but with enough options to keep even hardened tabletop gamers interested. It is a turn based game that focuses on the choices you make about what weapons and upgrades you will give to your mechs and how those affect its abilities in the game. <br/>The game itself sees two or more players commanding an equal number of mechs to try and eliminate their opponent's forces. Every mech has two 'action points' to be used per turn for moving or shooting. Their speed of movement around the grid-based board is determined entirely by their speed attribute (which is reduced by adding lots of upgrades to a mech) and combat is undertaken through a dice-based system with modifiers added or subtracted due to the upgrades each mech has been given.</p>

<h3>What is Mechabrick UPGRADED?</h3>
<p>The focus of this campaign is to launch the first expansion for the Mechabrick game. Mechabrick UPGRADED includes a range of seven new precision-moulded plastic upgrade components to add to your Mechabrick mechs and give them new powers and abilities in the game. The expansion also includes a new rule-sheet detailing the specifications and rules for these new upgrades as well as a set of 20 playing cards for use with the brick-compatible 'upgrade crates' that are also in the pack. These crates are randomly placed around the board before the game and can be either opened to reveal an upgrade or shot when an enemy mech is near them to potentially make them explode and cause damage.</p>

<div>The new upgrade parts are precision molded in colours to match the existing mechs and upgrade parts in Mechabrick. As with all Mechabrick parts, every joint and attachment point is engineered to fit with standard building brick and minifig accessory parts. The details of the new components and their stats for the game are as follows (the stats are subject to minor change as play-testing continues):</div>

<div><br/></div>
<br/><h3>Why back this campaign?</h3>
<p>If you have not yet been introduced to Mechabrick, this campaign offers you an opportunity to get a copy of the original game (at well below retail price) along with a copy of the new expansion in a bundle pack that lets you jump straight in and get the most from this awesome game and model range.<br/>If you already have Mechabrick, you can just get the expansion pack to add the new upgrades to your mechs and the exciting new rules to your games.<br/>Whichever level you pledge at there are also some unique and exclusive bonus items we will be including at every perk level that you will not be able to get anywhere else. The <b>bonus items are listed in the perk levels below</b> and we will be adding extra bonuses to the perks as we unlock stretch goals through the campaign!</p>

</div></div>","NEW PERK LEVELS ADDED!
Please see below, you can now get a smaller perk of JUST a couple of the awesome Mechabrick mech kits or JUST the original boxed board-game!

What is Mechabrick?
Mechabrick is a board-game (launched earlier this year) that uses precision plastic robot models which you build and customise to fight epic battles in a futuristic city environment. The unique point of the game and the associated models is that every part of the mechs and every accessory component we make is compatible with leading plastic building brick brands and minifigs. The scenery around which the game is played is also built from your favorite plastic building bricks, bringing a unique element of creativity to the game.


At the core of the game, having taken over two years to develop and produce, are the 22-part precision molded plastic mech models. They are fully articulated and every component is compatible with your favorite plastic building brick components. You can even use a minifig torso and legs in the core of the mech model if you wish.



Playing the game:
The Mechabrick game is a simple strategy board game designed to be accessible for ages 10+ but with enough options to keep even hardened tabletop gamers interested. It is a turn based game that focuses on the choices you make about what weapons and upgrades you will give to your mechs and how those affect its abilities in the game. The game itself sees two or more players commanding an equal number of mechs to try and eliminate their opponent's forces. Every mech has two 'action points' to be used per turn for moving or shooting. Their speed of movement around the grid-based board is determined entirely by their speed attribute (which is reduced by adding lots of upgrades to a mech) and combat is undertaken through a dice-based system with modifiers added or subtracted due to the upgrades each mech has been given.
You can find out more about the game and models at: www.mechabrick.com




What is Mechabrick UPGRADED?
The focus of this campaign is to launch the first expansion for the Mechabrick game. Mechabrick UPGRADED includes a range of seven new precision-moulded plastic upgrade components to add to your Mechabrick mechs and give them new powers and abilities in the game. The expansion also includes a new rule-sheet detailing the specifications and rules for these new upgrades as well as a set of 20 playing cards for use with the brick-compatible 'upgrade crates' that are also in the pack. These crates are randomly placed around the board before the game and can be either opened to reveal an upgrade or shot when an enemy mech is near them to potentially make them explode and cause damage.


The new upgrade parts are precision molded in colours to match the existing mechs and upgrade parts in Mechabrick. As with all Mechabrick parts, every joint and attachment point is engineered to fit with standard building brick and minifig accessory parts. The details of the new components and their stats for the game are as follows (the stats are subject to minor change as play-testing continues):


Why back this campaign?

   Risks and challenges: This will be the third crowd-funding campaign we have run and the 6th we have provided products for so we have a good level of experience in running and delivering campaigns and know what can go wrong. To avoid the production delays experienced following our initial Mechabrick campaign (caused by unforeseen financial issues and an unexpected increase in the cost of tooling for the plastic robot kits)  we have invested in all tooling to manufacture these parts already. They are tested, prototyped and ready for production and shipping immediately following the campaign to make this as risk-free and rapid as possible. There are no up-front costs still to raise funds for and we are seeking funding JUST for initial production of the parts and to cover shipping costs and production of the printed materials that go with the new game expansion.
We have listed March 2016 as the expected ship date for the rewards however we hope to begin shipping MUCH faster than that, hopefully by the end of January 2016. The only element of the perks involving a 3rd party  is the printing of the custom printed parts and mechs.

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p><strong>The Legend of Zomba</strong> is an action-adventure game inspired by the gems of retro gaming. In the game, you will travel to ancient ruins, laboratories, fight mad scientists and solve multitudes of puzzles in your quest to find the three ancient artifacts prophesized to return the dead to the dust of the earth! The game is being developed with Adobe Flash CS5.5, but if stretch goals are reached a console port will be made possible.</p>
<p>The game is being developed as a <strong>PC, Mac and Linux</strong><strong> </strong>game, but with enough funding a mobile port and console release will be possible!</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8196/8110756705_695a59edea.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8333/8110763712_eafb6ceb9a.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<p>In <strong>The Legend of Zomba</strong> you take the role of Dr. Mann as he travels the world to locate three pieces of an ancient key said to unlock the gates of Hell and send the undead back to the dust of the Earth. You will explore <strong>three</strong><strong> unique ""dungeons"", each with its own puzzles, key item and boss battle.</strong> in addition to the dungeons, there will be a large overworld with several cities to explore and numerous side-quests to complete!</p>
<p>The game itself features many adventure elements, such as an expansive overworld, tons of cool locales to find, loads of quests and items and a deep backstory regarding the undead. It also features many action elements, as fighting all sorts of zombies is central to the game.</p>
<p>A key feature to the action is that weapons degrade over a long amount of time. Without proper maintenence they will break and become unusable, but maintained they become stronger! Your wooden club, for example, will turn into a studded club and then a spiked club!</p>
<p><strong>The more funding raised, however, the more the game can be expanded!</strong></p>
<p><strong>This means more content, another dungeon, cool new types of loot and weapons and more side-quests and side-stories!</strong></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Hayden Morris and i am an indie games developer. My main project is called Broken Council and it is a 3d fantasy game based around wizards and magic. Players take on the role of a young wizard Called Regan Valdor and guide him on a journey all the way from training to becoming a master wizard.</p>
<p>Broken Council is all about a deep magic system. The basis of the design is that you have a series of small rocks called runes. Each rune contains power and a magical effect. Mages operate by calling forth the power within these runes. On top of that they can combine the runes to create differnt forms of magic. There is also a skill system for a set of very specific and very unique set of abilities that mages can use.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Currently the game code sits at around 85% complete but to progress futher we need to purchase media to replace our temporary content. In order to do this we require money. Your funds will be spent on:</p>
<p>- Character models</p>
<p>- Sound Effects</p>
<p>- Textures</p>
<p>- Map models</p>
<p>In return i am offering copies of the game, extra content, merchandise and personalised interactions with people who help out the project. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Releasing a commerical game has been a dream for me and given this opportunity i believe i can create many more exciting and stimulating adventures for everybody to play and enjoy. Not only is this an investment in a single game but its an investment which might start a career of great games development.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I would be greatful for any help to advertise and comment on the game as it develops and when it is released.</p>

<p>Warbirds is Outrider Studio's latest RPG. It is a diesel-punk air combat adventure game that focuses on fighter pilots as they chase after fame and fortune. It combines the action and excitement of early adventure serials with chaos and heroism of World War 2 dogfights.</p>
<p>The game is set amongst the sky islands of Azure. It is an alternate reality version of the Caribbean islands (and the Florida and Yucatan peninsulas), floating in the sky above an endless murk.

</ul><p> </p><h2>Campaign:</h2><p>In the most distant reaches of the world, magic still exists, embodied by spirits of the land, of the sky, and of every natural thing. As the great powers of Europe stretch their colonial empires further and further, they will inevitably lay claim to a place where spirits still hold power - and when they do, the land itself will fight back alongside the islanders who live there.</p><p><i><strong>Spirit Island</strong></i> is a cooperative settler-destruction strategy game designed by R. Eric Reuss and set in an alternate-history world around A.D. 1700. Players become different spirits of the land, each with their own unique elemental powers, forced to defend their island home from colonizing Invaders spreading blight and destruction. Your spirits work with the native islanders to increase your power and drive the invading colonists from your island in this strategic area-control game.</p><p><strong>Handelabra Games</strong> and <strong>Greater Than Games</strong> are once again uniting to bring an amazing cooperative game to the digital tabletop!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1569859288/cqw5jkcan6jcmwikh0py.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>In Spirit Island, players choose between 1-4 spirits to control.

However, you can always cancel your pledge before the campaign is complete for a full refund, or if you wish to change your perk selection. You can also pledge multiple times to claim multiple perks, in contrast to Kickstarter where you can only back a given campaign once.</p><p>This campaign is being run as ""<strong>All or Nothing</strong>"" – just like how Kickstarter campaigns work. If we do not reach our funding goal by the end of the campaign, all pledges will be refunded.</p><h3>Why Indiegogo?</h3><p>We are running this campaign on Indiegogo, in contrast to our previous campaigns on Kickstarter, and some folks might wonder why.

 Campaign:In the most distant reaches of the world, magic still exists, embodied by spirits of the land, of the sky, and of every natural thing. As the great powers of Europe stretch their colonial empires further and further, they will inevitably lay claim to a place where spirits still hold power - and when they do, the land itself will fight back alongside the islanders who live there.Spirit Island is a cooperative settler-destruction strategy game designed by R. Eric Reuss and set in an alternate-history world around A.D. 1700. Players become different spirits of the land, each with their own unique elemental powers, forced to defend their island home from colonizing Invaders spreading blight and destruction. Your spirits work with the native islanders to increase your power and drive the invading colonists from your island in this strategic area-control game.Handelabra Games and Greater Than Games are once again uniting to bring an amazing cooperative game to the digital tabletop!In Spirit Island, players choose between 1-4 spirits to control. The number of spirits determines the size of the island. A single spirit game uses a single island board like this:*Pre-alpha screenshots. Subject to change before release.*Spirits start with limited options but grow in power over the course of the game. The Invaders will spread across the land, destroying Spirit Presence and Dahan, and Blighting the land. You will not be able to contain them forever.*Pre-alpha screenshots. Subject to change before release.*At the start of the game, Victory can only be obtained by obliterating all of the Invaders, which is extremely difficult! However, as you grow in power and escalate the fear in the hearts of the Invaders, progressively easier victory conditions will become available. The game ends immediately in Defeat if no more Blight is left in the Blight pool, if any player is knocked out of the game (by losing all Presence from the map), or if you take too long to rout the Invaders.*Pre-alpha screenshots. Subject to change before release.*Here's a short overview of how the game plays on the tabletop:..As you have come to expect from Handelabra Games, the digital version of Spirit Island is planned to be a faithful adaptation of the core game experience. Spirit Island for Steam is planned to cost $25 and include the following:

8 different Spirits, each with 4 Power Cards unique to that Spirit

Over 50 distinct Major and Minor Power Cards which Spirits can grow into
Modular Island map with 4 double-sided boards
Digital components representing the Invaders and Dahan (native islanders)

15 Invader cards, driving a distinctive Invader expansion system

15 Fear cards, showing what happens as you terrify the Invaders

3 multi-tier Adversaries (specific Invaders) for play variety and fine-tuned challenge: England, Brandenburg-Prussia, and Sweden

4 optional Scenarios for even more play variety
Local co-op play with 1-4 spirits

Interactive tutorial so you can learn the game while you play
Brand-new music composed by Jean-Marc Giffin

Windows, Mac, and Linux support
Steam Achievements

Steam Cloud Saves
All bonus features unlocked via the campaign
All the above are included with every perk that includes a Steam key for the game.The exclusive digital playmat is a cosmetic game background item that reflects your status as a backing supporter at the deluxe edition level and above.What does it mean to become a member of the beta team?Becoming a beta team member means you will get access to the private beta of the game via Steam ahead of any retail or Early Access launch. You will play the game to help us discover bugs, report them, and help us make sure the game is as good as it can possibly be. Choose your perk from the list on the right.We’ve secured 2/3 of the development budget for the base game already, but we need your help to get version 1.0 completed and shipped in the first half of 2020. But fully funding isn’t the end of the story. The other reason we are using crowdfunding for this project is the list of stretch goals you see below. With your help we can make the game even better!About Backing on Indiegogo:Indiegogo works differently than Kickstarter in that your card will be charged immediately when you back the campaign. However, you can always cancel your pledge before the campaign is complete for a full refund, or if you wish to change your perk selection. You can also pledge multiple times to claim multiple perks, in contrast to Kickstarter where you can only back a given campaign once.This campaign is being run as ""All or Nothing"" – just like how Kickstarter campaigns work. If we do not reach our funding goal by the end of the campaign, all pledges will be refunded.Why Indiegogo?We are running this campaign on Indiegogo, in contrast to our previous campaigns on Kickstarter, and some folks might wonder why. Put most simply, Kickstarter's work force is currently attempting to form a union, and Kickstarter management is opposing the process. We support Kickstarter's employees' efforts to decide for themselves whether to unionize, and the choice to use Indiegogo for this campaign is not a boycott of Kickstarter.Given the timing of our campaign and the possibility that the union may call for a boycott (they have not yet done so), we made the decision to use Indiegogo now so that we could keep this campaign as simple and stable as possible. We know that some people have strong feelings about which companies they support, and our hope is that using Indiegogo for this campaign will give the largest number of people the opportunity to support Spirit Island Digital in a way they feel comfortable with.Updated November 8th: 40k - Fully Funded!42k - PROMO SPIRIT: Heart of the Wildfire

We grew up playing Nintendo, Super Nintendo, and Sega Genesis as kids and wanted to really capture that old-school feeling.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The game is a blend of top-down adventure and space shoot-em-up games. One of the most prominent features is that abilities obtained in one game mode carry over to the other, offering a dual purpose for every new upgrade. Using this as our basic model we began working on interesting mechanics that would appeal to a more modern audience, taking notes from more recent titles.  </p>

<h1><br/></h1>
<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">The Inspiration</h1>
<p>A lot of the inspiration for The Omega Imperative comes from a lesser-known, yet much beloved game on the classic Nintendo Entertainment System; a game known in the U.S as The Guardian Legend. That game was a fantastic blending of the top-down action adventure genre and the vertical scrolling shooter genre. The Omega Imperative aims very much to capture that same engaging and action-packed blending of genres, into one exhilarating game. This exciting fusion of genres is a great attribute to the overall uniqueness of our game.    </p>
<p>The design of The Omega Imperative is also significantly influenced by other classic games from the 8 and 16-bit eras. We have a genuine appreciation for the classics and we want to share that in the form of a quality title that we hope many can enjoy. We want to share that feeling that we had when we were kids, compelled by a great game to keep on playing until we had blisters on our thumbs.</p>
<h1><b><br/></b></h1>
<h1 style=""text-align: center;""><b>The Funding</b></h1>
<p>To make this project a reality we need your help. We came up with the modest figure of 4200 to fund this game. The money raised in this campaign will go toward paying publishing costs, production and development expenses, and hiring contracted artists. We have a vast network of creative people to draw upon to bring this game to a polished and complete state.</p>
<p>While we haven't included stretch goals, we are open to expand our scope if we do break our goal. The foremost mission is to gather support for a promise and scope we know we can deliver on before trying to branch further. That said, we'd very much like to publish to as many platforms as possible. Playing the game with a controller feels very natural, and it would be exiting to release on console markets if the community has interest. There are also many features on the cutting room floor that we would love to be able to add back in from a wake of overwhelming support.</p>

<p><b>Mike Bonafede</b></p>
<p>Mike Bonafede grew up in a small town in western New York where he spent most of his time playing classic video games. His love for games came from his grandfather, who taught him how to play games of strategy like Chess at a young age. His love for entertainment came from his father, a musician, and helped foster his creativity.</p>
<p>After getting his associates degree in Multimedia Design he moved east and worked as a game tester for several years on titles like Guitar Hero and Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 before moving on to pursue a bachelors in Game Design. Now an undergrad, he’s looking to use his talents to make games and put his skills to the test. With this project he seeks to join the community of independent developers in shaping the future of the game industry.</p>
<p><b>Mike Lamark</b></p>
<p>Mike Lamark was born and raised in southwestern Pennsylvania, and played his first Atari 2600 game when he was roughly 2 years old. That was the beginning of his lifelong passion for games, and as he got older and played more games, he became increasingly curious about how they were made. This intrigue and passion for games evoked in him his greatest dream and aspiration; to one day become a game designer.</p>
<p>With that goal ever-present in his mind, he decided to pursue a degree in game design. Now, after having earned his degree, he is putting his skill and knowledge to work to create a fun and exciting game experience that he can’t wait to share with everyone. For him, making games is the ultimate dream come true.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>These two designers met at Full Sail University and immediately recognized that their skills, passions, and backgrounds aligned in that special blend that formed this dynamic duo. Now, here they are ready to take on the world with your help.   Check out this interview on Obsolete Gamer for more about us!</p>

</div></div>","The GameThe Omega Imperative is a game that we are developing with the golden age of games in mind. We grew up playing Nintendo, Super Nintendo, and Sega Genesis as kids and wanted to really capture that old-school feeling.  
The game is a blend of top-down adventure and space shoot-em-up games. One of the most prominent features is that abilities obtained in one game mode carry over to the other, offering a dual purpose for every new upgrade. Using this as our basic model we began working on interesting mechanics that would appeal to a more modern audience, taking notes from more recent titles.  


 The hero Kobayashi and the Omega Drone




The Features  

6 top down adventure areas with upgrades and secrets to find in the Omega Facility
5 action packed vertical shooter levels to fight through with the Omega Drone
Over 20 enemy types in both game modes to test your skills, including epic boss fights
Combine the 5 Fusion Cores for 15 unique abilities to aid in fighting off the alien invasion
All abilities and upgrades are usable in both the Facility and Drone levels
Original retro soundtrack and pixel art will hit you right in the nostalgia feels.


 These alien invaders have all but conquered the planet

The Inspiration
A lot of the inspiration for The Omega Imperative comes from a lesser-known, yet much beloved game on the classic Nintendo Entertainment System; a game known in the U.S as The Guardian Legend. That game was a fantastic blending of the top-down action adventure genre and the vertical scrolling shooter genre. The Omega Imperative aims very much to capture that same engaging and action-packed blending of genres, into one exhilarating game. This exciting fusion of genres is a great attribute to the overall uniqueness of our game.    
The design of The Omega Imperative is also significantly influenced by other classic games from the 8 and 16-bit eras. We have a genuine appreciation for the classics and we want to share that in the form of a quality title that we hope many can enjoy. We want to share that feeling that we had when we were kids, compelled by a great game to keep on playing until we had blisters on our thumbs.

The Funding
To make this project a reality we need your help. We came up with the modest figure of 4200 to fund this game. The money raised in this campaign will go toward paying publishing costs, production and development expenses, and hiring contracted artists. We have a vast network of creative people to draw upon to bring this game to a polished and complete state.
While we haven't included stretch goals, we are open to expand our scope if we do break our goal. The foremost mission is to gather support for a promise and scope we know we can deliver on before trying to branch further. That said, we'd very much like to publish to as many platforms as possible. Playing the game with a controller feels very natural, and it would be exiting to release on console markets if the community has interest. There are also many features on the cutting room floor that we would love to be able to add back in from a wake of overwhelming support.

The Designers
Mike Bonafede
Mike Bonafede grew up in a small town in western New York where he spent most of his time playing classic video games. His love for games came from his grandfather, who taught him how to play games of strategy like Chess at a young age. His love for entertainment came from his father, a musician, and helped foster his creativity.
After getting his associates degree in Multimedia Design he moved east and worked as a game tester for several years on titles like Guitar Hero and Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 before moving on to pursue a bachelors in Game Design. Now an undergrad, he’s looking to use his talents to make games and put his skills to the test. With this project he seeks to join the community of independent developers in shaping the future of the game industry.
Mike Lamark
Mike Lamark was born and raised in southwestern Pennsylvania, and played his first Atari 2600 game when he was roughly 2 years old. That was the beginning of his lifelong passion for games, and as he got older and played more games, he became increasingly curious about how they were made. This intrigue and passion for games evoked in him his greatest dream and aspiration; to one day become a game designer.
With that goal ever-present in his mind, he decided to pursue a degree in game design. Now, after having earned his degree, he is putting his skill and knowledge to work to create a fun and exciting game experience that he can’t wait to share with everyone. For him, making games is the ultimate dream come true.

These two designers met at Full Sail University and immediately recognized that their skills, passions, and backgrounds aligned in that special blend that formed this dynamic duo. Now, here they are ready to take on the world with your help.   Check out this interview on Obsolete Gamer for more about us!

Some of our projects


What kind of a game is it?
Syrian Warfare is a real time strategy with a high degree of realism. This game is not about a base construction or units production. The player will have to determine their forces characteristics before they go into action. And during the mission they would be able to select reinforcements in order to support the troopers.
The troops and machinery crews move from mission to mission and gain experience, which helps them increase their effectiveness.
Trophies captures by the player on the battlefield can be used throughout the whole campaign.
Importantly enough, there are no «life bars» for vehicles in the game. Damages are calculated by taking into account the protection module and the power of adverse factors. Inflicted damages affect the functioning of the module. In the battle field, it is impossible to repair the armor, but one can 
repair the modules by using a limited stock of spare parts.By the way, ammunition and fuel are also limited.A system of high-quality physical demolition of buildings and other objects is used in the game (it does not only look spectacular, but it has a serious influence on the tactics during the missions, especially in urban areas). 
The game has a wide set of tactical possibilities: storming of buildings,usage of smokescreens, infantry lift by helicopters and APC/IFV, air strike calls, capturing of trophy weapons and equipment, usage of heat flares and active defence complexes.


And of course the story itself. We will try to show the conflict not from a point of view of a general, located somewhere at the ‘top’. No, it will be a story of a man, who lived in the country that descended into hell. A story of struggle, loss and regained hope. This game does not claim to be a history lesson, but it shows the 
course of the war in all its seriousness through the major milestones, 
from the first days till the latest important victories over terror.When will the game be released?

<p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></b></p>
<p><b>Q: Will it be free?</b><span><br/></span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">A: Yes. We will release this app on Google Play and Apple Store for FREE; without ads and without Lite or Pro version. It will be absolutely FREE for you.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Q: When is the expected release date?</b><span><br/></span></span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">A: We already marked our calendar on <b>June, 2014 for BETA version.</b> Although the initial release may be for one platform, we will try to bring both versions on the same day. </span></p>
<p>BETA version means we will give you a link to install and test the app on your device before it becomes officially available on the App Store or Google Play Store. If everything works perfectly within next 30 days after BETA launch, we will submit it to the stores then all of your networks can download it for FREE, as promised.</p>
<p><b>Q: Is Sociyo an MLM company?</b><span><br/></span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">A: No, we are not. We are a group of people who can't let more people fail in network marketing business. We have seen our friends and family fail and return to their daily jobs, tear their dream books and try to accept the bitter pill. We just want to support people like them by giving great apps to run network marketing with a better chance of success.</span></p>

We believe that network marketing is one of the greatest business plans on earth in the present global economy. This is because network marketing makes it possible for anybody to start a home-based business with small amount of money. Its compensation plan is also exceptional. It allows leaders who have already succeeded in their businesses to support their downlines or groups. In short, you become successful by helping other people to get successful too.If we get support from leaders who are already successful, there are high chances for us to become successful too, right?Logically, yes that's true, but in the practical world, the reality is not that simple. Here's why :We've experienced this problem ourselves and seen it in our friends and even family. This is why we started the Sociyo project. Our intention is to connect more and more successful people to become mentors to their downlines and help them with valuable information until they can change their own lives.Using Sociyo is very simple. You can start by searching or inviting your uplines or downlines. When you find people you know, add them 'as downline' or 'as upline' and when they approve your request, you'll see them on your network tree.Once you're connected with people you know, you'll be able to send them messages, see their updates or even learn new marketing technique from them.Imagine yourself as upline : With Sociyo, now you can reach your downlines to an unlimited level of depth. You can see their faces; you can see what they're doing; and you can give them new marketing skills or product information. You can nurture them using the device that's already in your hand. You can help them change their lives! And of course, if you help more people succeed in network marketing, you will achieve your own success too.Imagine yourself as a downline : If you're new to the network marketing business, the support from uplines is very important. They are great people who are willing to spend their time helping you from zero until you can make your first sale. Now, imagine something greater than that. With Sociyo installed on your phone, you can track many of your 'ancestors' and you will be able to learn how to succeed more intensely with them.Imagine yourself as network marketer : If the network marketing industry increases its success rate as more uplines get connected with their downlines, can you imagine what other people would say about this business? That's right... They will describe network marketing using great words, and they will see this industry differently.Be part of this project and let's make a great impact in network marketing… together.Some people who we know on network marketing, including ourselves, promised their children, spouses or parents that they would change their lives forever. Unfortunately, some of them chose to give up down the line for lack of tools to help them achieve their dreams.We just can't let them fail and get back to their daily jobs while we have something that can help them. No, we can't... It’s frustrating to see other people's hopes get dashed like that simply because we don’t have enough money to fund this project.That's why we need your support to make their hopes, their dreams and maybe yours too, remain alive.This is not our first project. We developed a small project in 2012, named Emivo. It's a Web-based project that is particularly focused on providing an appropriate site building platform for network marketers.We want to take what we have learned from the Emivo project to next level. We want to help more people by creating a FREE app for all, which we have named Sociyo.Currently, we're funding this project from our own pockets. We have spent our time doing research and making concept of this app. We have also done the programming codes on the server side. However, to accelerate the development process, include additional features and carry maintenance or updates in the future, we need to hire more full time programmers. We tried to outsource this project last month but did not find those who could fulfill our standards. So, the best way to do this is by having full-time programmers on our side. We also want to take this project seriously, which means we want to provide updates and more features to run network marketing more easily in the future.For us, this is not just about making a great app but it's a mission to make our friends, family and other people out there become successful in achieving their dreams in the network marketing business.You can help us by spreading the word about this campaign in many different ways. Here are just some examples of what you can do :
Share this campaign to your Facebook, Twitter and Google+ friends.


You can also inform your uplines or downlines via email. Tell them that this campaign needs their support too.

Post to your blog. If you're a blogger, kindly make a post to your own blog about the impact of this campaign to the network marketing business.
If you have any question about this contest, feel free to contact us by email : ask@sociyo.com.We have several plans and features to be executed in months ahead to make this project more complete than you see it today. We can push the development process as long as we have more programmers to hire. When we reach a certain level of donation, here's what you will have in return :

We have been thinking hard about the kinds of perks that can we give to you in return of your donation. What came first to mind was giving you tons of merchandise. However, those will not help you to grow your business, and it will cost you more for shipping and handling.So we try to give you more valuable things in return...We will give you what we have done for the last 5 years. We have been teaching people how to sell their products on the Internet, and today, we want you to have our training module as our perk to you.We give you perks with technical knowledge to make your network marketing visible on the internet. Starting with simple stuff such as : resizing your product images, editing video, hosting a webinar, building your own website, etc. If you need something more advanced than that, we have marketing tutorials : how to advertise your product on Google Adwords and Facebook so that you can be reached by people around the world without leaving your home. Plus, if you want to automate the follow-up process on the internet, you will enjoy our 'REMARKETING' training module. 'REMARKETING' technique will help you bring your prospects back to your website. We will give you detailed screenshots on how to do it correctly.All the tutorials are in PDF format and MP4 (video), which is DRM free (downloadable). This means you can read it on your iPad, smartphone, laptop or any other devices that can read PDF files and MP4 videos.

Q: Is this for Android or Apple device?A: Both. Sociyo requires Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) or later, iPod Touch or iPhone with iOS 7 or later.


Q: Will it be free?A: Yes. We will release this app on Google Play and Apple Store for FREE; without ads and without Lite or Pro version. It will be absolutely FREE for you.
Q: When is the expected release date?A: We already marked our calendar on June, 2014 for BETA version. Although the initial release may be for one platform, we will try to bring both versions on the same day. 
BETA version means we will give you a link to install and test the app on your device before it becomes officially available on the App Store or Google Play Store. If everything works perfectly within next 30 days after BETA launch, we will submit it to the stores then all of your networks can download it for FREE, as promised.
Q: Is Sociyo an MLM company?A: No, we are not. We are a group of people who can't let more people fail in network marketing business. We have seen our friends and family fail and return to their daily jobs, tear their dream books and try to accept the bitter pill. We just want to support people like them by giving great apps to run network marketing with a better chance of success.
Q: Can I contact you if I have great idea to share?A: Sure, why not! Check our 'contact us' below.

<p>This is a little crowdfunding. The idea is to produce an amount of 28 mm resin honker miniatures that will be only available during this Indiegogo campaign. They won't be available in stores, as the idea is to share some luv, not to create an imperium.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/101277/files/20130928130127-FIGHT_2.JPG?1380398487"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><h3>WHAT WE NEED?</h3>
<p>Money for producing the miniatures ;] All money will be used for producing perks. And if we get enough of those green papers, we'll do some special miniatures ( as space colonist or Bixo eggs ) as rewards, and continue with next steps in this weird project.</p>
<p><strong>A Plan</strong></p>
<p>The first step is to do a pack of 10 different models of Colonial Tercios and 10 different models of Bixos.</p>
<p><strong>B Plan</strong></p>
<p>If we reach the goal, and people keep interested, our next step will be place a new goal and to do a pack of 5 more different models of Colonial Tercios with special weapons and 2 Characters, and 5 more different models of mutant Bixos and ""Known"" Bixos.</p>
<p><strong>C Plan</strong></p>
<p>If we reach that goal, our next step will be place a new goal and to do rules and maps for playing with all those miniatures. Of course, with your help.</p>
<p><strong>D Plan</strong></p>
<p>If we reach that goal, our final step will be place a new goal and to do rules for playing with centimetres and a pair of big special miniatures.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474197587/1_w1f1hp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>BI-XO... WHAT?</h3>
<p>People out there ( in Spain, most of them ) remember those honker miniatures in the 90s. There is no way to get them now, but maybe these, altough different, could fit that little hole in their hearts ( and glass cabinets ).</p>
<p>Bi-xo Wars is about opening doors, shoot, run and scream when one of your infected partners become a Bixo near to you. If you have seen Alien, you got it. That's all. Isn't enough?</p>

""Colonial Tercios and Bixos are fighting in a lost colony of BI-XO quadrant. Would you help them? ... Any of them will be fine""
Bi-Xo Wars is about using honkers and stupid sense or humour for doing some sci-fi fun.
This is a little crowdfunding. The idea is to produce an amount of 28 mm resin honker miniatures that will be only available during this Indiegogo campaign. They won't be available in stores, as the idea is to share some luv, not to create an imperium.WHAT WE NEED?
Money for producing the miniatures ;] All money will be used for producing perks. And if we get enough of those green papers, we'll do some special miniatures ( as space colonist or Bixo eggs ) as rewards, and continue with next steps in this weird project.
A Plan
The first step is to do a pack of 10 different models of Colonial Tercios and 10 different models of Bixos.
B Plan
If we reach the goal, and people keep interested, our next step will be place a new goal and to do a pack of 5 more different models of Colonial Tercios with special weapons and 2 Characters, and 5 more different models of mutant Bixos and ""Known"" Bixos.
C Plan
If we reach that goal, our next step will be place a new goal and to do rules and maps for playing with all those miniatures. Of course, with your help.
D Plan
If we reach that goal, our final step will be place a new goal and to do rules for playing with centimetres and a pair of big special miniatures.BI-XO... WHAT?
People out there ( in Spain, most of them ) remember those honker miniatures in the 90s. There is no way to get them now, but maybe these, altough different, could fit that little hole in their hearts ( and glass cabinets ).
Bi-xo Wars is about opening doors, shoot, run and scream when one of your infected partners become a Bixo near to you. If you have seen Alien, you got it. That's all. Isn't enough?

""Tercios Coloniales y Bixos luchan en una colonia olvidada del cuadrante BI-XO. ¿Les ayudarás? ... A cualquiera, eso es lo de menos""Bi-Xo Wars va de usar narizones y un estúpido sentido del humor para crear un poco de diversión en ciencia ficción.
Esta es una pequeña campaña de mecenazgo. La idea es producir un montón de miniaturas de narizones de resina de 28 mm. que estarán disponibles sólo para esta campaña de Indiegogo. No estarán disponibles en tiendas, ya que la idea es repartir hamor, no crear un imperio.QUÉ NECESITAMOS?
Dinero para producir las miniaturas ;] Todo el dinero se usará para producir los perks. Y si conseguimos bastantes de esos papelajos verdes, haremos algunas miniaturas especiales ( como colonos espaciales o huevos de Bixo ) como recompensas, y continuaremos con los siguientes pasos de este proyecto de locos.
Plan A
El primer paso es hacer un pack de 10 modelos diferentes de Tercios Coloniales y otros 10 modelos diferentes de Bixos.
Plan B
Si llegamos hasta el primer goal, y la gente sigue interesada, el siguiente paso será establecer un nuevo goal y hacer un pack de 5 nuevos modelos de Tercios Coloniales con armas especiales y 2 Personajes, y 5 nuevos modelos de Bixos mutantes y Bixos ""Conocidos"".
Plan C
Si conseguimos ese nuevo goal, el siguiente paso será establecer un nuevo goal y hacer reglas y mapas para jugar con todas esas miniaturas. Por supuesto, con vuestra ayuda.
Plan D
Si conseguimos ese nuevo goal, el siguiente paso será establecer un nuevo goal y hacer reglas para jgar con centímetros y un par de miniaturas especiales grandes.BI-XO... QUÉ?
La gente ( en España, la mayoría de ellos ) recuerda aquellas miniaturas de narizones de los 90s. No hay forma de conseguirlas hoy día, pero puede que estas otras, aunque no iguales, cierren esa heridas en sus corazoncitos ( y vitrinas ).
Bi-xo Wars trata sobre abrir puertas, disparar, correr y gritar cuando uno de tus compañeros infectados se convierte en Bixo a tu lado. Si has visto Alien, ya sabes de qué va. Eso es todo. ¿No es suficiente?


OTRAS FORMAS DE AYUDAR

<li>Hi there, my name is Kwame Nkrumah-Acheampong [a.k.a. The Snowleopard], as I have been told I am a bit of an endangered species when it comes to skiers you see on slopes, and especially at an Olympics. I am Ghana's first winter Olympian and just in case you are wondering where Ghana is, its a little country on the coast of West Africa, bordering the Atlantic ocean known for its Black Stars football team, cocoa and gold. I am professionally a tourism management professional having worked at Snozone Milton Keynes [an indoor ski centre in UK, and also Planet Ice Milton Keynes [an ice rink]. I have held managerial positions in a number of establishments. I am the holder of 2 degrees in Tourism Management including a masters degree from Westminster University, London.</li>
<li>Well enough of Kwame the professional and more of The Snowleopard. I got into skiing whilst working at the ski slope and due to a comment made that I could not become a good skier, I decided to take things one step further by attempting to qualify for an Olympics in record time. I missed out on the Turin Olympics by about 87 points.

<strong>YOUR CONTRIBUTION</strong> - It's not everyday that one gets the chance to say I helped build that historic monument.

<strong>PLACING YOUR TRUST IN ME</strong> - I am pretty aware that the question of 'can this chap really build a ski slope' must be rattling around somewhere in your brain. Against all odds and a mountain of obstacles, I made it to the Olympics. I qualified through months of hard work on and off the slope. I campaigned and got sponsorship from companies mostly in the form of equipment and I can say the biggest support when it finally came to the actual Olympics was from my family and fans.

Hi there, my name is Kwame Nkrumah-Acheampong [a.k.a. The Snowleopard], as I have been told I am a bit of an endangered species when it comes to skiers you see on slopes, and especially at an Olympics. I am Ghana's first winter Olympian and just in case you are wondering where Ghana is, its a little country on the coast of West Africa, bordering the Atlantic ocean known for its Black Stars football team, cocoa and gold. I am professionally a tourism management professional having worked at Snozone Milton Keynes [an indoor ski centre in UK, and also Planet Ice Milton Keynes [an ice rink]. I have held managerial positions in a number of establishments. I am the holder of 2 degrees in Tourism Management including a masters degree from Westminster University, London.
Well enough of Kwame the professional and more of The Snowleopard. I got into skiing whilst working at the ski slope and due to a comment made that I could not become a good skier, I decided to take things one step further by attempting to qualify for an Olympics in record time. I missed out on the Turin Olympics by about 87 points. My failure hit me real hard, especially after battling through a lot of negative comments about the impossibility of going from none skier to top level skier in a matter of 2 years. However I did not give up and managed to make qualification for the 2010 Olympics. I think its a testament to my never give up attitude and willingness to give things a committed try.
 WHY A SKI SLOPE -           One of the concept drawings for the ski slope project in Mamfe            I want to keep the flame I kindled in lots of people and youngsters not only in Ghana but around Africa burning, by building on what I was able to achieve through the Olympics and bringing snow to West Africa.

strategic survival, set during a present day zombie apocalypse. Staying 
alive is your only goal in this game, and you must work with your allies
 to search for human survivors, abandoned locations, and lifesaving 
equipment to fend off the zombie horde.  Teamwork is the key to victory,
 for if you can't trust your fellow players none of you will reach the 
CDC... alive!</i><br/><br/>Dead Apocalypse is a fully cooperative deckbuilding game, meaning all players strive for the same goal and either win together or lose together. Dead Apocalypse is  1-4 players so if there isn't someone in your company you still have the opportunity to try to fight for survival all alone. Don't fret though because there are other game variants for those seeking an easier game or a more competitive game.<br/><br/><p>With the help from my amazing artist, Joel Wittlif, and the support 
of many friends and family who helped cut lots of paper and playtest, 
we've been able to accomplish all the game design, the rulebook, all 87 
card illustrations, all card design and the packaging design! The next 
milestone is manufacturing. Since I'm keeping the project local and not 
outsourcing any work, there happens to be a well renowned and 
professionally experienced game manufacturer right here in Battle Creek,
 Michigan where I'm located! Delano Services has been an industry leader
 in printing many popular games now including Fluxx and Killer Bunnies. 
Nothing would be greater than to see Dead Apocalypse printed alongside 
such great games!</p><p>Currently I can account for about a 3rd of the 
manufacturing costs, all hard earned cash at my day job that I'm 
personally investing in this project. I need help jumping this last 
hurdle, but I'm not going to ask for you to account for the remainder of
 my costs. Instead, I'm going to ask that you help me get just what I 
need to have the manufacturer print the project. This happens to be half
 the actual cost - they require half up front and the other half once 
finished printing. This will significantly help me on my conquest to put
 a game on the market and make something of myself. We've all worked 
hard to try to achieve our goals and aspirations, that goes without even
 being said. So this is my dream and goal, to have something tangible to
 show for all the hard work and time I've invested in games. I've been 
creating games since I was a boy and always had the same ambition, that 
someone might one day recognize me and connect me with the game I've 
created, because the game meant something to him or her.</p><p></p><p></p><h3><br/></h3><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Want to help but don't have the spare change? Here's what you can do.<br/><br/><ol>

One thing to know about me is that I've always been unnaturally passionate about board/card games, so much that I decided to get off my butt and make one of my own game concepts a reality!This campaign is to help us raise funds to pay for the upfront manufacturing costs for the game so that we can take the proof of concept (prototype) to GenCon 14' and other game conventions this summer to gain exposure. Provided are a variety of perks you'll receive for your generosity.Zombie and Human Perks!We're setting out to raise $6000 to fund the preliminary manufacturing costs required for printing to begin. I especially want to meet this goal so that I can have a proof of concept in time for GenCon which is August 14-17 in Indianapolis, Indiana. I'm planning to hold events in which people can sign up to play the game! It'd be the perfect first exposure to introduce Dead Apocalypse to the world.Manufacturing CostsOriginally I had Delano Services quote for 275 cards. 1000 copies was quoted at $18,070.50 and 1500 copies was quoted at $20,828.20. This includes the cost for the box packaging, the rulebook, all 275 cards, a platform in the box to organize the cards and shrink wrap.Now there are only 242 cards per game, which should knock down the price significantly. I'm roughly estimating about $16,000 for 1000 copies.Half of that is due upfront  (about $8000) and the rest after printing is finished. Your proceeds will contribute to this preliminary upfront cost. The remainder will come directly out of my pocket as it should since I'm publishing the game myself. But don't think for once that your contributions go unnoticed.RewardsDue to your selflessness and generosity, we offer spectacular rewards! Rewards include:
Recognition and High Praise on our website and rulebook!!
Digital Wallpaper

Digital Artbook
Complete Full Color Print and Play

One of a kind Dead Apocalypse T-Shirt

The Dead Apocalypse game with promos upon release

Your face in the game!
(Any image and name submitted must not be a copyrighted work, and is subject for approval to ensure we protect our image)For ""The In-Game Experience"" perk, choose one of these Human cards and give us the name you would like the card changed to!For ""The Living Dead Guy"" perk, choose one of these Zombie cards and give us the name you would like the card changed to!The ImpactDead Apocalypse is one of the first fully cooperative deckbuilding games of 
strategic survival, set during a present day zombie apocalypse. Staying 
alive is your only goal in this game, and you must work with your allies
 to search for human survivors, abandoned locations, and lifesaving 
equipment to fend off the zombie horde.  Teamwork is the key to victory,
 for if you can't trust your fellow players none of you will reach the 
CDC... alive!Dead Apocalypse is a fully cooperative deckbuilding game, meaning all players strive for the same goal and either win together or lose together. Dead Apocalypse is  1-4 players so if there isn't someone in your company you still have the opportunity to try to fight for survival all alone. Don't fret though because there are other game variants for those seeking an easier game or a more competitive game.With the help from my amazing artist, Joel Wittlif, and the support 
of many friends and family who helped cut lots of paper and playtest, 
we've been able to accomplish all the game design, the rulebook, all 87 
card illustrations, all card design and the packaging design! The next 
milestone is manufacturing. Since I'm keeping the project local and not 
outsourcing any work, there happens to be a well renowned and 
professionally experienced game manufacturer right here in Battle Creek,
 Michigan where I'm located! Delano Services has been an industry leader
 in printing many popular games now including Fluxx and Killer Bunnies. 
Nothing would be greater than to see Dead Apocalypse printed alongside 
such great games!Currently I can account for about a 3rd of the 
manufacturing costs, all hard earned cash at my day job that I'm 
personally investing in this project. I need help jumping this last 
hurdle, but I'm not going to ask for you to account for the remainder of
 my costs. Instead, I'm going to ask that you help me get just what I 
need to have the manufacturer print the project. This happens to be half
 the actual cost - they require half up front and the other half once 
finished printing. This will significantly help me on my conquest to put
 a game on the market and make something of myself. We've all worked 
hard to try to achieve our goals and aspirations, that goes without even
 being said. So this is my dream and goal, to have something tangible to
 show for all the hard work and time I've invested in games. I've been 
creating games since I was a boy and always had the same ambition, that 
someone might one day recognize me and connect me with the game I've 
created, because the game meant something to him or her.Other Ways You Can HelpWant to help but don't have the spare change? Here's what you can do.

<p><strong>The Game’s Plot:</strong></p>
<p>The plot follows Fijleh, a radish monk. He is a sword master and weapon specialist. His character is aggressive and easily angered; he hates people getting in his way. Fijleh is found sitting in his cave, searching for inner peace when his world is turned upside down by the ‘Idols’. The Idols are fallen Gods who were once worshipped but have lain dormant for a long period of time. Their arrival once more disrupted Fijleh’s meditation and his temperament leads him to seek revenge, armed with his Broccoli sword.</p>
<p>The game art is a cartoon-stylized form of animation, complementing the theme of the world. The game follows Fijleh on his quest where he meets multiple characters; allies, enemies and scary bosses. The game includes a Multiplier function, encouraging players to play together in Co-Op or against one another competitively.</p>

<p><strong>The aim of this mode is to spark the competition; should an ‘NPC’ deny the main player from finishing the mission in the time challenge.

<h3>KURDISTAN'S ANSWER TO THE SYRIAN WAR</h3>
<p><em><strong>This is a joint project of photographer Jeffry Ruigendijk and Belgian journalist/arabist Annabell Van den Berghe. </strong></em></p>
<div>Soon we will be heading to Kurdistan to write down the stories of the Kurds. The Syrian civil war has caused a lot of damage, and a lot of changes also within the Kurdish region. The relation between several minorities in the region became even more tense than before. Fear is finding its way to the farest outskirts of the area, and political instability is a fact. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Together we will put down in words and in images what life means nowadays in Kurdistan. We work together on a profound story and on a tvdocumentary. The last preparations are being made. We are buying our bullet proof jacket, getting insured and last but not least buying a lots of antibiotics and blankets for the inhabitants who cannot reach medical support if needed and we insure ourselves.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This is a call to all of you to share this project and to follow us through twitter  @Annabellvdb and @JeffRuig. And for those who want to contribute, we made this possible through this website. For every fund there will be a reward. A big thank you, mentioning your name at the credits of the documentary, and even a personal photoshoot. </div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Please spread the word, and thanks a lot for your support!</div>
<p><em><strong> </strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>When did we start this project?</em></strong></p>
<p>Right before Christmas Jeffry got smuggled into Syria to make a photo documentary. What he saw blew him away. His explaination:</p>
<p>""The area I got smuggled into is known to the Kurds as Western-Kurdistan. And what I saw here was a brand new democracy. Idealistic, young, fragile. Every governmental council or organisation was divided by a minimum of 40% elected women, 40% elected men. In the middle of the Middle East! The garbage was being collected, judges made their rulings, police patrolled the streets. Normal for us, but bizarre over there!</p>
<p>I tried to capture all this in images. But then I had to go. I want to go back, and capture the happenings. Both the successes and failures. And I want to contribute where possible by bringing them medicins and blankets."" </p>
<p>By funding this project, you make it possible for us to bring this story to the world. We will spread the news and give it the international attention it needs and deserves. And meanwhile, we can already do something about the bad health situation of a lot of the Kurdish people.  </p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What you gonna do with that cash?</h3>
<p>Of course, it's not all peace in Kurdistan. They regularly get attacked by islamist rebels and by the government soldiers and planes. That is why this democracy is so fragile. The Kurds also blame Turkey in aiding the islamists to break their newly founded democracy. And they got oil. Bad position to be in. So they fight both Assad's army, and the islamists. Part of your money will go to insurance for both of us, the other part will go to antibiotics and blankets for those in need.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Basically we need</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li> as much as possible for aid to the local people</li>
<li> 1000 euro in airline tickets</li>
<li> 700 euro to get smuggled over the border twice</li>
<li> 600 euro for 2 go-pro camera's that I can strap to myself or to the     Kurdish rebels</li>
<li> 800 euro a month for the fixer</li>
<li> 170 a month in insurances</li>
<li> 400 a month for my rent</li>
<li> 300 a month for gasoline (prices tripled overthere!)</li>
<li> 100 a month for food</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>As a contriber you get:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>-Over 10 euro: <em>A big fat 'Thank You' on twitter and on this page. </em>
</li>
<li>-Over 25 euro: <em>That fat 'Thank you' and an awesome mobile phone sticker. The sticker sports a 'Kurdish sun' on it. It will make you shine! </em>
</li>
<li>-Over 100 euro: <em>A 'Thank You' for you or your company on my website during, and months after, the trip. A limited (1/50) photo of your choice (after return), A4 size. </em>
</li>
<li>Over 500 euro: <em>That 'Thank You' from above, plus that photo from above, plus a portrait of yourself, or someone you want photographed, shot in Amsterdam. This will be after the trip, upon my return. </em>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><em><strong>!!!Keep checking this campaign for new photo's!!! </strong></em></p>

<h3><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Who are these Kurds? </span></strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>The Kurdish territory is spread over Syria, Turkey, Iran and Iraq. The world counts approx. 45 million Kurds. In Syria many Kurds are stateless. That means they are foreigners on their own land. They are not allowed to speak Kurdish, they have no passports, their identity card identifies them as a foreigner. This means they cannot own a business, or a house. Being active in Kurdish social organisations could get them imprisoned before the revolution. When the revolution started many of Assad's soldiers left to fight elsewhere. The YPG rebels, who are Kurdish, filled in this gap. They fought against the remaining Assad soldiers, and with the Free Syrian Army. Their area is still not totally Assad free. What happens after the revolution is unclear. Kurds fear being overrun by islamists, because of their oil. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>And who are we?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Annabell: </strong></p>
<p><span>Annabell Van den Berghe is a journalist and Arabist/Hebraist. She started working as a producer and journalist in Egypt for the Belgian broadcast channel Canvas. Since then she has been active as a freelance producer and journalist for Dutch, Arabic and English media. She is also sworn translator for Arabic and Egyptian colloquial and teaches Arabic as a guest lecturer at K.U.Leuven.</span></p>
<p><strong>Jeff: </strong></p>
<p>After traveling the world to surf, from age 22 to age 35, I returned to Holland in November 2012. In this time of travel, freedom had become an important part of my life. Something not only I should have, but all people. The single most important human right, if you ask me.</p>
<p>Photography had been a hobby during all those travels, but back in Holland I decided to see if I could make a living of it. I started assisting the renown Dutch portrait photographer Tessa Posthuma de Boer to learn more. One day, after assisting Tessa with the making of a portrait of Dutch MP Diederik Samson, I met a demonstrating Syrian outside the minister’s offices. He told me about the Kurdish struggles, and their current attempt at self-rule. This made me curious, so I went there. </p>

Who are these Kurds? 


The Kurdish territory is spread over Syria, Turkey, Iran and Iraq. The world counts approx. 45 million Kurds. In Syria many Kurds are stateless. That means they are foreigners on their own land. They are not allowed to speak Kurdish, they have no passports, their identity card identifies them as a foreigner. This means they cannot own a business, or a house. Being active in Kurdish social organisations could get them imprisoned before the revolution. When the revolution started many of Assad's soldiers left to fight elsewhere. The YPG rebels, who are Kurdish, filled in this gap. They fought against the remaining Assad soldiers, and with the Free Syrian Army. Their area is still not totally Assad free. What happens after the revolution is unclear. Kurds fear being overrun by islamists, because of their oil. 
 
And who are we?

Jeff: 
After traveling the world to surf, from age 22 to age 35, I returned to Holland in November 2012. In this time of travel, freedom had become an important part of my life. Something not only I should have, but all people. The single most important human right, if you ask me.
Photography had been a hobby during all those travels, but back in Holland I decided to see if I could make a living of it. I started assisting the renown Dutch portrait photographer Tessa Posthuma de Boer to learn more. One day, after assisting Tessa with the making of a portrait of Dutch MP Diederik Samson, I met a demonstrating Syrian outside the minister’s offices. He told me about the Kurdish struggles, and their current attempt at self-rule. This made me curious, so I went there.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>Responses
to the Vega Project </b></p>
<p>Our
Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign for the <b>Sinclair
Spectrum Vega</b> games computer has been a great success.  We raised £149,521, which is 50% more than
our target.</p>
<p>We
also received a lot of <span>positive media coverage
for the <b>Vega</b> project, as well as
many comments of support. Here is a sample group of recent postings by Spectrum
fans.</span></p>

<p>Excellent idea!</p>
<p><b>The
Manufacturing Process Begins</b></p>
<p>Our
manufacturer, SMS Electronics Ltd of Beeston, Nottinghamshire, has now started
the various procedures necessary to put the <b>Vega</b> onto their assembly line. They are ordering the electronic
components, they are working with the plastics factory to ensure that the
tooling drawings are complete and accurate, and once the tools for the plastics
have been made SMS will be checking to ensure that the various parts of the <b>Vega</b>’s case and key arrangements fit
together perfectly. These are just a few of the tasks that need diligent
management and quality control at every stage, in order to deliver thoroughly
tested <b>Vega</b> computers.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1185842/files/20150131022838-factory.jpg?1422700118"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>Inside
the SMS Electronics Ltd factory in Nottinghamshire</b></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>In the
meantime we have been inundated with many offers from the owners of rights to
Spectrum games. By the end of January we had already been given permissions
from these rights owners for <span>many hundreds of tried and tested games, many of them famous games
from the 1980s. And more games are being offered to us almost every day, please
do still contact us if you would like to see your games added to the <b>Vega</b>.</span></span></p>
<p><b>More
Features Added</b></p>
<p>During
the two months when our Indiegogo campaign was running we received many
suggestions and questions from Spectrum fans about various features that they
would like to see added to the <b>Vega</b>’s
specification. It is very important to us to satisfy as many as possible of
these Spectrum fans, so we have considered all of their suggestions, and as a
result we have decided to add two of their suggested features to the
specification of the <b>Vega</b>.</p>
<p><b>1  ZX
Spectrum games often make use of the keyboard to perform additional game
operations. We are therefore adding extra buttons to the Vega, giving the user
direct access to such operations for the majority of games.</b></p>
<p><b>2   We
are designing the Vega with the capacity for expansion by providing a hardware
interface on it's circuit board, and by allowing future software upgrades.</b></p>
<p>These
improvements to our original specification have now been completed in the
circuitry, on the printed circuit board layout, and in the plastics designs and
the tooling drawings.</p>
<p>We will
be making more announcements about the manufacturing process from time to time
in order to keep you up to date with our progress.</p><p></p><p><b>FIRST ENQUIRIES FROM RETAIL DISTRIBUTORS</b></p>
<p>Even before we could think
seriously about our retail distribution plans we began to receive enquiries
from companies in the UK
and abroad, companies interested in the possibility of distributing the Vega
via retail channels. We are having our first meetings with UK-based retail
distributors in the coming weeks but we expect it will be another few months
before we decide on the optimal distribution policy for retail distribution –
whether to work through many retail outlets or whether to make exclusive
distribution deals for a whole country or region. Either way, we expect the
Vega to be in the shops, in the UK at least, around September 2015. </p>
<p>And of course we will
definitely be selling the Vega from our web site and, for the foreseeable
future, from the Indiegogo site.</p>
<p><b>AND FINALLY</b></p>
<p>Thank you again for your interest
in the Vega project and for your support. We will be providing regular news
updates on the project as time goes on.</p><br/><div>

<p>The <b>Sinclair Spectrum Vega</b> is a new low
cost games <span>computer based on Sir Clive’s hugely
successful Spectrum products of the early 1980s.</span></p>
<p>The <b>Sinclair Spectrum Vega</b> takes advantage
of major advances in technology to achieve big cost savings by replacing most
of the electronics in the earlier computer products. Instead the <b>Vega</b> uses a <span>low
cost micro-controller and a clever piece of software
that combine to enable the <b>Vega</b>
to run all of the games, 14,000 or more of them, which were developed during
the years when some 5 million of the original <b>Sinclair Spectrum</b> were being sold.</span></p>
<p><span>
</span></p>
<span><p>The <b>Sinclair Spectrum Vega</b> is being
marketed by Retro Computers Ltd, a Luton-based start-up in which Sir Clive’s
company, Sinclair Research Ltd, is a shareholder. The development and marketing
of the <b>Sinclair Spectrum Vega</b> is
under licence from Sky In-Home Service Ltd, who inherited the intellectual
property rights to the Spectrum computers from Amstrad.<span>  Development of the product is complete, and a
fully-functioning prototype is ready to go into production.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The <b>Sinclair Spectrum Vega</b> is as simple to
use as any of the popular games consoles, but far less expensive. It plugs into
a TV, so no computer monitor is necessary, and comes complete with around 1,000
games built-in. The <b>Vega </b>has
sufficient memory to allow the user to download the many additional games we
will be making available from time to time free of charge.</p></span>
<p><span>
</span></p>
<span><p>The <b>Vega</b> has been developed by a former ZX Spectrum games developer who is the world's leading expert on
Sinclair Spectrum technology.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Retro
Computers Ltd is making arrangements with the owners of the software rights to
Spectrum games to donate a combined software royalty to a charity – Great Ormond
 Street Hospital
for Children. The company’s Chairman, Dr David Levy, had his life saved by the
hospital when he was diagnosed with meningitis as a 3-year-old.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This
Indiegogo campaign is to raise funds to <span>manufacture the first 1,000
units of the <b>Vega
</b>within the UK and to prepare us for the second
production run.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This is your
opportunity to be one of the first to own a <b>Vega</b>, as well as a range of other exciting <span>perks.
These include: concept art, signed by Sir Clive Sinclair, of our
original concept designs; a copy of a new book about the creation of the <b>Sinclair Spectrum Vega</b>; an invitation
to the Vega launch party next spring; and an invitation to ‘come to dinner’ and
meet some of the Retro Computers Ltd team. In addition those who pledge <b>£50</b> or
more will have their names added to the ‘Digital Role of Honour’ which will be
embedded into the Vega’s memory, displayed on our web site (unless you choose to be anonymous) and can be displayed on
the TV when using the Vega.</span></p></span>
<p><span>
</span></p>
<span><p><b><u>Current Status</u></b><b><span>  </span></b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The
development of the <b>Sinclair Spectrum
Vega</b> is complete, <span>and we have a fully
working prototype waiting to go into
production within the UK.
We are making contact with thousands of the original
Spectrum game developers in order to secure their permission to use their games
on the <b>Vega</b>, for which a combined
software royalty will be donated to charity </span>‒
Great Ormond Street
 Hospital for children.</p>
<p>Once the first 1,000 Limited Edition Vegas have been manufactured and shipped, and we move on to 
the next 3,000 units and thereafter to batches of 10,000 or more, the retail price of 
the Vega will reduce. But even at £100 the cost of the limited edition Vega, 
with its 1,000 games built-in, represents a huge saving over the cost of the 
original product plus the cost of 1,000 of the original Spectrum games. What 
cost thousands of pounds back in the 1980s is now available for around 1 per 
cent of that amount.<br/></p></span>
<p><span>
</span></p>
<span><p><b><u>Inspiration for the Sinclair Spectrum
Vega</u></b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The <b>Vega</b> is a culmination of many years of
work and perseverance by our team, who have come together to create something
special that resonates with <span>those who grew up with the original <b>Sinclair Spectrum</b>, as well as being
accessible to today’s gamers who are looking for some nostalgic game play while
having the ease of use of modern technology at an
incredibly low price. For enthusiasts
who would like to know more about the project you can pledge to receive, as one of the perks, the book <b>‘Creating The Sinclair ZX Vega’</b>which has been written
by the team about our journey to create the <b>Vega</b>. </span></p>

The
<b>Sinclair Spectrum Vega </b>has been
designed and developed by the world’s leading expert on the
technology behind the Sinclair ZX Spectrum range of computers.</span></p>
<p><span>
</span></p>
<span><p><b><u>Features of the Sinclair Spectrum
Vega</u></b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Vega is
very simple to operate. Just connect it to your TV with the cables provided and
off you go. Games are accessed through a menu based system and are easy to
access. Games <span>load automatically, taking you directly
into the game play mode. When you wish to play another game, simply
press the centrally placed reset button and this takes you back to the main menu. Nothing could be simpler.</span></p></span>

Responses
to the Vega Project 
Our
Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign for the Sinclair
Spectrum Vega games computer has been a great success.  We raised £149,521, which is 50% more than
our target.
We
also received a lot of positive media coverage
for the Vega project, as well as
many comments of support. Here is a sample group of recent postings by Spectrum
fans.
Paul Vincent 
I have all the spectrum
computers and they still work now and I have a massive collection of the old
tapes and love it just as much now as I did when I first got them
Steven Bohme 
Thanks brought back
memories. Hope they have Top Gun as one of the 1000 games, spent many hours on
that one. Cheers Steve.
Thorlak Barfod 
Keep the ZX Spectrum alive
– one of the greatest memories from my childhood :-) What a brilliant idea the
ZX Spectrum VEGA is!
Keep up the good work!

Vic Howlett 
As an grey surfer this
appeals to me it’s a great idea full of retro games brilliant – what next?
Fee Sturrock 
I use an Emulator for the
Nintendo DS, But Cant wait for this , Keep up the good work guys . ZX Spectrum
rules :)
Richard Townley 
I remember have the 16k ZX
Spectrum when it was released and then upgrading it to 48k with the chips. I
now use an Emulator now but this would be so much better!!
Ben James 
Very nostalgic about this.
I’d love to think I can excite my kids about playing Pssst or Atic Atac
Stewart Byron 
Can’t wait until June!
silelf 
Excellent idea!
The
Manufacturing Process Begins
Our
manufacturer, SMS Electronics Ltd of Beeston, Nottinghamshire, has now started
the various procedures necessary to put the Vega onto their assembly line. They are ordering the electronic
components, they are working with the plastics factory to ensure that the
tooling drawings are complete and accurate, and once the tools for the plastics
have been made SMS will be checking to ensure that the various parts of the Vega’s case and key arrangements fit
together perfectly. These are just a few of the tasks that need diligent
management and quality control at every stage, in order to deliver thoroughly
tested Vega computers.

Inside
the SMS Electronics Ltd factory in Nottinghamshire
In the
meantime we have been inundated with many offers from the owners of rights to
Spectrum games. By the end of January we had already been given permissions
from these rights owners for many hundreds of tried and tested games, many of them famous games
from the 1980s. And more games are being offered to us almost every day, please
do still contact us if you would like to see your games added to the Vega.
More
Features Added
During
the two months when our Indiegogo campaign was running we received many
suggestions and questions from Spectrum fans about various features that they
would like to see added to the Vega’s
specification. It is very important to us to satisfy as many as possible of
these Spectrum fans, so we have considered all of their suggestions, and as a
result we have decided to add two of their suggested features to the
specification of the Vega.
1  ZX
Spectrum games often make use of the keyboard to perform additional game
operations. We are therefore adding extra buttons to the Vega, giving the user
direct access to such operations for the majority of games.
2   We
are designing the Vega with the capacity for expansion by providing a hardware
interface on it's circuit board, and by allowing future software upgrades.
These
improvements to our original specification have now been completed in the
circuitry, on the printed circuit board layout, and in the plastics designs and
the tooling drawings.
We will
be making more announcements about the manufacturing process from time to time
in order to keep you up to date with our progress.FIRST ENQUIRIES FROM RETAIL DISTRIBUTORS
Even before we could think
seriously about our retail distribution plans we began to receive enquiries
from companies in the UK
and abroad, companies interested in the possibility of distributing the Vega
via retail channels. We are having our first meetings with UK-based retail
distributors in the coming weeks but we expect it will be another few months
before we decide on the optimal distribution policy for retail distribution –
whether to work through many retail outlets or whether to make exclusive
distribution deals for a whole country or region. Either way, we expect the
Vega to be in the shops, in the UK at least, around September 2015. 
And of course we will
definitely be selling the Vega from our web site and, for the foreseeable
future, from the Indiegogo site.
AND FINALLY
Thank you again for your interest
in the Vega project and for your support. We will be providing regular news
updates on the project as time goes on.
_________________________________________________________________________



Sir Clive Sinclair and Retro
Computers Ltd are pleased to announce the launch of the Sinclair ZX Spectrum
Vega

Every Vega sold will contribute to a 
children's charity


(Render of Sinclair Spectrum Vega)




(Photo of 3D model prototype not final model)
The Sinclair Spectrum Vega is a new low
cost games computer based on Sir Clive’s hugely
successful Spectrum products of the early 1980s.
The Sinclair Spectrum Vega takes advantage
of major advances in technology to achieve big cost savings by replacing most
of the electronics in the earlier computer products. Instead the Vega uses a low
cost micro-controller and a clever piece of software
that combine to enable the Vega
to run all of the games, 14,000 or more of them, which were developed during
the years when some 5 million of the original Sinclair Spectrum were being sold.


The Sinclair Spectrum Vega is being
marketed by Retro Computers Ltd, a Luton-based start-up in which Sir Clive’s
company, Sinclair Research Ltd, is a shareholder. The development and marketing
of the Sinclair Spectrum Vega is
under licence from Sky In-Home Service Ltd, who inherited the intellectual
property rights to the Spectrum computers from Amstrad.  Development of the product is complete, and a
fully-functioning prototype is ready to go into production.


The Sinclair Spectrum Vega is as simple to
use as any of the popular games consoles, but far less expensive. It plugs into
a TV, so no computer monitor is necessary, and comes complete with around 1,000
games built-in. The Vega has
sufficient memory to allow the user to download the many additional games we
will be making available from time to time free of charge.


The Vega has been developed by a former ZX Spectrum games developer who is the world's leading expert on
Sinclair Spectrum technology.


Retro
Computers Ltd is making arrangements with the owners of the software rights to
Spectrum games to donate a combined software royalty to a charity – Great Ormond
 Street Hospital
for Children. The company’s Chairman, Dr David Levy, had his life saved by the
hospital when he was diagnosed with meningitis as a 3-year-old.


This
Indiegogo campaign is to raise funds to manufacture the first 1,000
units of the Vega
within the UK and to prepare us for the second
production run.


This is your
opportunity to be one of the first to own a Vega, as well as a range of other exciting perks.
These include: concept art, signed by Sir Clive Sinclair, of our
original concept designs; a copy of a new book about the creation of the Sinclair Spectrum Vega; an invitation
to the Vega launch party next spring; and an invitation to ‘come to dinner’ and
meet some of the Retro Computers Ltd team. In addition those who pledge £50 or
more will have their names added to the ‘Digital Role of Honour’ which will be
embedded into the Vega’s memory, displayed on our web site (unless you choose to be anonymous) and can be displayed on
the TV when using the Vega.


Current Status  


The
development of the Sinclair Spectrum
Vega is complete, and we have a fully
working prototype waiting to go into
production within the UK.
We are making contact with thousands of the original
Spectrum game developers in order to secure their permission to use their games
on the Vega, for which a combined
software royalty will be donated to charity ‒
Great Ormond Street
 Hospital for children.
Once the first 1,000 Limited Edition Vegas have been manufactured and shipped, and we move on to 
the next 3,000 units and thereafter to batches of 10,000 or more, the retail price of 
the Vega will reduce. But even at £100 the cost of the limited edition Vega, 
with its 1,000 games built-in, represents a huge saving over the cost of the 
original product plus the cost of 1,000 of the original Spectrum games. What 
cost thousands of pounds back in the 1980s is now available for around 1 per 
cent of that amount.


Inspiration for the Sinclair Spectrum
Vega


The Vega is a culmination of many years of
work and perseverance by our team, who have come together to create something
special that resonates with those who grew up with the original Sinclair Spectrum, as well as being
accessible to today’s gamers who are looking for some nostalgic game play while
having the ease of use of modern technology at an
incredibly low price. For enthusiasts
who would like to know more about the project you can pledge to receive, as one of the perks, the book ‘Creating The Sinclair ZX Vega’which has been written
by the team about our journey to create the Vega. 


Sir Clive
Sinclair talks to David Levy about the original Spectrum –



Development of the Vega

The
Sinclair Spectrum Vega has been
designed and developed by the world’s leading expert on the
technology behind the Sinclair ZX Spectrum range of computers.


Features of the Sinclair Spectrum
Vega


The Vega is
very simple to operate. Just connect it to your TV with the cables provided and
off you go. Games are accessed through a menu based system and are easy to
access. Games load automatically, taking you directly
into the game play mode. When you wish to play another game, simply
press the centrally placed reset button and this takes you back to the main menu. Nothing could be simpler.

Manufacture of the Sinclair Spectrum
Vega


We already
have a fully functioning prototype of the Vega.
You can see a game running on the prototype here -





We
have a short-list of four UK electronics manufacturing companies, and will soon
be making our choice between them to commence assembly of the Vega in the UK.  Following our initial run of 1,000 units we
plan to increase production steadily, with 3,000 units in the second production
run followed by batches of 10,000 or more. All of our initial sales will be via
our web site but subsequently we will be seeking marketing arrangements with
distributors in the UK, USA
and elsewhere.

Delivering the Vega  
The first
1,000 backers who pledge £100 or more in support will receive the limited
edition Vega as one of their perks.
Some of the other perks available are: Having your name added to the roll of honour on the Vega, Concept art
signed by Sir Clive Sinclair, copies of the book about the Vega’s creation,
come to the official launch of the Vega, or come and meet some of the team over
dinner!

Risks and Challenges
We have
worked very hard to minimize the risks and challenges to this project. We have
contracted with Sky In-Home Service Ltd to ensure the correct hardware
permissions are in place. We are seeking permissions from the software rights
holders to incorporate their games in the Vega.
Members of our team have many years of experience in creating, developing, and
selling electronic devices, as well as experience in publishing and retail
sales. 
In
the very unlikely event that we do not raise sufficient funding to manufacture
the first 1,000 units we will return all pledged money to those who picked a Vega as their perk.

</div></div>","You pick the celebrity, the occasion, and your loved one's name.
Here's An Example.
How cool would it be if you gave your friend named Meredith, who's favorite celebrity is Fergie, a card that, when you open, has Fergie's actual voice, inside the card, saying her name and wishing her Happy New Year?

""Hey what's up Meredith! It's your girl Fergie! Happy New Year!"" 



100% Of Greeting Card Profits To Charity
Each celebrity that joins the giveStars family picks the charity they are most passionate about. 
 
Just A Few Of The Charities GiveStars Supports:
Every celebrity who joins the giveStars family will bring a new charity into the fold. 



We Need Your Help
Our main goal is to work hand-in-hand with celebrities to make a real difference in the world by giving 100% of our greeting card profits to the causes they care about most.
By crowdfunding, we are ensuring that our model remains intact and is being supported by others who feel the same way we do.

<h1>What are RepliCade Amusements?</h1>
<div>
<p>At New Wave Toys, we believe that bringing home the arcade experience means more than simply playing the original arcade ROM. The video arcade experience is a blend of many things, and to truly bring that experience into your home requires great attention to detail. </p>
<p>RepliCade Amusements combine a blend of traditional design and materials with modern technology to recreate your favorite arcade classics in sixth scale. </p>
<p>These miniaturized arcade machines are fully playable and officially licensed by the original manufacturers. Every detail in these amazing works of arcade art has been painstakingly reproduced, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wooden cabinet in perfect profile</li>
<li>Accurately reproduced control system</li>
<li>Backlit LED marquee with authentic art</li>
<li>Authentic metal coin door</li>
<li>Vividly reproduced side panel art, bezel, and control panel overlay graphics </li>
</ul>
<p>For our RepliCade X Centipede Collector's Edition, the Trackball and push buttons have been resized to coordinate with the sixth scale cabinet while retaining a fully-functional and satisfying gameplay experience. </p>
<p>And of course all RepliCade machines run the original arcade game ROMs you expect! </p>
<p>Our goal is to give you the ability to recreate classic video game arcade ambiance in your own home for a fraction of the cost and size of full-sized, vintage arcade cabinets. </p>
<p>With RepliCade Amusements, you can finally build your very own collection of classic arcade machines from the 70's, 80's and 90's, the perfect complement to your toy collection, game room, home or office. </p>

At New Wave Toys, we believe that bringing home the arcade experience means more than simply playing the original arcade ROM. The video arcade experience is a blend of many things, and to truly bring that experience into your home requires great attention to detail. 
RepliCade Amusements combine a blend of traditional design and materials with modern technology to recreate your favorite arcade classics in sixth scale. 
These miniaturized arcade machines are fully playable and officially licensed by the original manufacturers. Every detail in these amazing works of arcade art has been painstakingly reproduced, including:

Wooden cabinet in perfect profile
Accurately reproduced control system
Backlit LED marquee with authentic art
Authentic metal coin door
Vividly reproduced side panel art, bezel, and control panel overlay graphics 

For our RepliCade X Centipede Collector's Edition, the Trackball and push buttons have been resized to coordinate with the sixth scale cabinet while retaining a fully-functional and satisfying gameplay experience. 
And of course all RepliCade machines run the original arcade game ROMs you expect! 
Our goal is to give you the ability to recreate classic video game arcade ambiance in your own home for a fraction of the cost and size of full-sized, vintage arcade cabinets. 
With RepliCade Amusements, you can finally build your very own collection of classic arcade machines from the 70's, 80's and 90's, the perfect complement to your toy collection, game room, home or office.

I know this is complex so please contact me or post a comment if you have any questions.





         The risks and challenges to bring Kardland to life have already been addressed. The Production ""molds"" have been completed. All of our 3D characters are made here,  so we won't have to deal with any problems.
We don't have any specialist to come and say: ""Hey, this is a good or a bad game!""We let you to judge all the aspects of Kardland Board Game and more than that we are open to your preference suggestions as well as the constructive criticisms.
Throughout the Indiegogo (as well as after it ends) we will be available to answer any questions, and will do our best to keep everyone informed about the status of this project. I  will be live in the comments section as often as possible, and I will also be monitoring any messages sent through Indiegogo or Facebook.
We have worked very hard to bring this game in your hands, and we are almost at the finish line. We just need your help.

 
                                       
           We are a family team which work in Design/Game field firfiricastudio.com . We have almost ten years of experience and Kardland is ""our child"" because is our first Tabletop Game project.
Since last year we decided to begin this challange because we considered to have enough experience designing for other companies.
That's why we need your help for this project.





Folks please get the word out and make some noise about our campaign.

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>My brother Scott has suffered autism all his life, he's very uncomfortable in any in-person social experience, he struggles to hold down a vocal conversation and often interprets what you say as an attempt to upset him.</p>
<p>Because of this he prefers to spend a lot of his time indoors on the decayingly old family PC, he either plays video games or chats to a few people from different corners of the globe. In the past when the PC has broke he has becoming very bored, and somewhat depressed.</p>
<p>At the moment he is studying cooking under a special needs education provider called CASE. Because Scott has chosen a different path of education than computers/IT he has been refused funding to buy a PC from his disability payers as they believe he doesn't need one. </p>
<p>Whilst he doesn't need a PC I still find it to be essential as it is his only enjoyable form of entertainment and the only way he feels comfortable talking to people.</p>
<p>By donating to this campaign you'll be helping buy and build a new PC for Scott to play games and communicate with his friends.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need?</h3>
<p>To build Scott a decent PC I only need £400 to cover the components and delivery cost the £500 is an imposed minimum set by indiegogo. I will help Scott to build the PC as he has always taken an interest in such a thing.</p>
<p>If the funding goal<strong> is not</strong> reached then the money will be placed in my savings account and I will look at alternate sources to cover the remainder of the funding.</p>
<p>If the funding goal <strong>is</strong> reached or exceeded then the extra cash will be used to pay off the IndieGoGo Charge/fee, and any excess cash will be spent on better components, any further cash which is insufficient for purchasing hardware will be spent on buying software/games for Scott or donated to charity (depending upon Scotts choice).</p>
<p>The list of parts I currently plan to buy for Scott are:</p>

<p>Keep in mind the parts may change as per availability or extra funding recieved but all contributions WILL be spent on the PC or Software/Games for Scott.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Whilst I can't say your contribution will cause a globewide difference or help improve the living conditions for a huge amount of people I can say that It will help keep Scott happy and also prevent the worry of the family PC dying in the near future as well as eliminate the monthly break downs the current PC is having.</p>

<h3>Why Communism?</h3>
<p>Creating a game about communism just seemed like the perfect idea, by purchasing, funding, and playing the game, you are using the benefits of capitalism, all while shoving communism in the dirt. The game over all started as just a funny thought to try to bash communism but we quickly realized it could actually turn into a real game that could be really fun. While this is by no means a AAA game it is made with care and giving the player a unique experience was one of our top priorities.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our funding goal will be set at $1,500, this will facilitate our hiring of another coder as well as getting some of the more custom art pieces made, for example many of the cut scenes are placeholder or non-existent at this point.</p>
<p>By funding this game you will, along with helping us create an awesome game, receive a game code for itch.io as well as steam code once the game makes it through steams admission process. The higher level donations also have bonuses such as a smattering of our concept art or our complete soundtrack featuring some of our originally composed music.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This type of game is relatively rare these days, our game may look like the many other political games on steam and itch.io but ours will be back up with actual substance. Right now we're looking at a 6-8 hour long story line when complete. This is still with the relatively small price tag of $5 or (3.9 pounds) </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>This game has some relatively large challenges to over come at this point the first being the garnering of more funds to assist in our production of the game. We could also run into unforeseen difficulty with any one of the many aspects of the game, art or coding or even sound. These will all however be sorted out in due time, the worst thing that could happen would be a delayed release. Our biggest hurdle currently is getting the game on steam through steam direct. If this does not happen however you WILL still receive your game, it will just be through itch.io instead of steam.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can help by spreading this indieGoGo page and telling your comrades about the game</li>
<li>Help share on social media too!</li>
</ul>
</div><h3>The Story</h3><p>The game follows a small band of upstart rebels known as the hoppean resistance first operating out of a small village in the Ural mountains near western russia. After the resistance is confident enough (through your help as their lead operative) they overtake the town finally moving into Moscow and setting their eyes on Stalin, the tyrant of the time. This story is made up of 5 central acts with 3 chapters in each. At this point we're looking at a run time of 5-8 hours.</p><h3>Gameplay</h3><p>The game is an action RPG that follows your custom character through his development from down trodden peasant to upstart hero to full fledged rebellion leader. Along the way you'll meet several colorful personalities (a few of which can be customized with a high enough donation) and gain their trust and aid in helping you on your personal journey through the communist oppression. The game play centers around our fighting system which will feature numerous period firearms and other goodies. However on some missions going loud won't get you very far and you must stealthily evade the Red star police while completing your mission. The game will also focus around gaining the support of the local citizenry usually through doing side missions for valuable members of the community.</p><h3>Budget</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500875818/t4rqfftjvr8hwpjcdkqs.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>Our Team</h3><p>Our team is comprised of talented  individuals who are able to help progress the game with their own unique skills. Our head programmer teaches and takes classes at DigiPen, one of America's top video-game schools. We also have a talented musical lineup including Brett Ambler, you may not know him by his real name, but you probably know him as the ""Kazoo Kid"".</p></div>","Why Communism?

After the resistance is confident enough (through your help as their lead operative) they overtake the town finally moving into Moscow and setting their eyes on Stalin, the tyrant of the time. This story is made up of 5 central acts with 3 chapters in each. At this point we're looking at a run time of 5-8 hours.GameplayThe game is an action RPG that follows your custom character through his development from down trodden peasant to upstart hero to full fledged rebellion leader. Along the way you'll meet several colorful personalities (a few of which can be customized with a high enough donation) and gain their trust and aid in helping you on your personal journey through the communist oppression. The game play centers around our fighting system which will feature numerous period firearms and other goodies. However on some missions going loud won't get you very far and you must stealthily evade the Red star police while completing your mission. The game will also focus around gaining the support of the local citizenry usually through doing side missions for valuable members of the community.BudgetOur TeamOur team is comprised of talented  individuals who are able to help progress the game with their own unique skills. Our head programmer teaches and takes classes at DigiPen, one of America's top video-game schools. We also have a talented musical lineup including Brett Ambler, you may not know him by his real name, but you probably know him as the ""Kazoo Kid"".",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h1><span lang=""EN-ZA"">whatisfiction?</span></h1>
<p><span lang=""EN-ZA"">Hi my name is Jonny Eaglefeather and I am the brains behind one of the craziest, most ambitious gaming projects ever conceived. whatisfiction is a hybrid medium that combines alternate reality, augmented reality, mediated reality &amp; personal reality gameplay experiences. What this means in laymen’s terms is that the ‘<em>ultimate game</em>’ takes place in the real world in multi reality universe.</span></p>
<p><span lang=""EN-ZA"">The premise of using the real world as gaming platform is not a new idea. ARG’s have been around for well over a decade and they have already inspired some pretty<span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span><a href=""http://www.cracked.com/article_19346_the-5-most-insane-alternate-reality-games.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">insane</a><span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span>experiences. What makes us instantly different, is our approach… whatisfiction is a mixed media movement, operating within a bold new partnership that bridges the gap between dance culture, gaming, reality television, film &amp; the art of illusion.</span></p>
<p><span lang=""EN-ZA""> </span></p>
<h1><span lang=""EN-ZA"">A World First?</span></h1>
<p><span lang=""EN-ZA"">As you may have gathered this has never been attempted before and is clearly a ‘WORLD FIRST.’ The medium is powered by a clothing label called Deeper Meaning, which acts as an organic dispersal mechanism to distribute clues and items throughout the world itself; while simultaneously acting as one of the primary revenue streams to fund the whatisfiction universe.</span></p>
<p><span lang=""EN-ZA"">It is a universe populated by players, the audience, brands and the various underpinnings of the five realities. I can promise you one thing, this will be like no other game you have ever played, or will ever play. If you dare to venture deep enough into our universe, it will inevitably change your ideas about reality itself.</span></p>
<p><span lang=""EN-ZA""> </span></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-681 lazy"" data-src=""http://www.whatisfiction.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/whatisfiction-metacultureas.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""whatisfiction""/></p>
<h1><span lang=""EN-ZA"">Inside the whatisfiction Universe...</span></h1>
<p><span lang=""EN-ZA"">I bet most of you have imagined being some character on television or in the movies, perhaps even the hero or heroine. Traditionally the hero is on a mysterious quest, battling unknown forces, while travelling the four corners of the earth in search of the ultimate ‘prize’. whatisifiction takes this classic tale &amp; digitally re-masters it for the 21st Century in a new medium that will take you well beyond virtual reality itself. whatisfiction is a hybrid medium that combines alternate reality, augmented reality, mediated reality &amp; personal reality gameplay experiences.</span></p>
<p><span lang=""EN-ZA"">An alternate reality game or ARG is an interactive narrative that uses the real world as a platform &amp; makes use of ‘transmedia’ to deliver a story that can be altered by the ‘participants’ ideas or actions. Augmented reality or AR is a live, direct or indirect, view of the physical, real-world environment whose elements are fundamentally augmented by computer generated sensory input such as video, sound, graphics or GPS data.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h1><span lang=""EN-ZA"">A Future Game?</span></h1>
<p><span lang=""EN-ZA"">The whatisfiction universe consists of five levels of reality; the first two realities introduce you to the various levels of the Mind Game, the basic interactions of the new medium &amp; also allow us to share key information about the whatisfiction universe. The other three realities will be where Ultimate Reality takes place, and where the game evolves even further, as the audience &amp; players have to work closely together to unravel the inner mystery of whatisfiction.</span></p>
<p><span lang=""EN-ZA"">The idea of a futuristic game isn’t new or even remotely farfetched by Hollywood standards. One of the earliest examples was 1975’s Roller Ball, but it didn’t end there. We also had The Running Man, Escape from New York, Starship Troopers, Star Wars Ep. 1 Phantom Menace, Death Race, Real Steel, Gamer &amp; the Hunger Games, to name but a few.</span></p>

<h1><span lang=""EN-ZA"">A Race?</span></h1>
<p><span lang=""EN-ZA"">When I created whatisfiction I didn’t think that anyone else would be in the race toward the ultimate game, primarily because of the nature of the format. I was pleasantly surprised when Will Wright shared his game concept ‘<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqUkMsYL1Yc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HiveMind</a>’ towards the end of 2011.  </span></p>
<p><span lang=""EN-ZA"">For those of you who don’t know him by name, he is the legendary creator of the live simulation video games Sim City, the Sims &amp; Spore. While our approaches differ radically we do still share a number of common ideas, primarily because he is one of my inadvertent teachers. </span></p>
<p><span lang=""EN-ZA"">You can click the hyperlink above to get an idea of how Will wants to shape the future of gaming… </span></p>

<h1>DISCOVERING ‘Our’ Deeper Meaning?</h1>
<p>Deeper Meaning is the culmination of that vision. It represents the ‘<em>remarkable triumph</em>’ of a fledgling creative movement to give life to a reality altering idea without ever having had ‘any real money’ to pursue, or even create said idea...</p>
<p>The key to the whatisfiction universe is a label called Deeper Meaning, which is VERY IMPORTANT...</p>
<ul>
<li>Because we only ever make one hundred of any design.</li>
<li>The shirts are customised to suit your individuality with a personalised 6 digit code</li>
<li>The first edition shirts feature only twelve designs.</li>
<li>There are two types of special edition shirts: the first has hidden clues &amp; the second comes with a unique graphical novel that offers vital clues to unlocking the twelve digital realms.</li>
<li>whatisfiction acts as a platform for artists to have their art immortalised as part of the whatisfiction Universe forever.</li>
<li>A dollar ($) from every piece of whatisfiction (Deep Meaning) merchandise sold is used to create the ‘greatest crowd funded jackpot of all time’ for the Ultimate Game. This jackpot will also be amplified through sponsorship deals with other affiliate brand partners. The deeper meaning label will see an exponential organic growth, without sacrificing the exclusivity of the experience &amp; leading to over commercialisation.</li>
<li>We never waste money on advertising but rather choose to reinvest in your experience.</li>
</ul><p> </p>

<h1><span lang=""EN-ZA"">The Crux of the Matter</span></h1>
<p><span lang=""EN-ZA"">This campaign serves two purposes: (1stly) it is a funding tool to add much needed resources so we can grow our community before the launch of the Ultimate Game &amp; (2ndly) to create global awareness about the project so we can secure the relevant big brand partners to create the entire whatisfiction universe.  </span></p>
<p><strong><span lang=""EN-ZA"">Why should you invest the time or the money to help us?</span></strong></p>
<p><span lang=""EN-ZA"">You should support us because we are the under dogs, the unknowns, the x-factor that no one anticipated and we are not offering you a one dimensional experience. While it may not be the easiest concept to wrap your head around, the chances of anyone ever attempting this again are slim to none. </span>I can honestly say we not doing this to make ourselves rich and this experience goes way beyond money, so we feel that counts for something.</p>
<p><span lang=""EN-ZA"">We want to make it to the number one spot on Indiegogo with your help, to do this we need to get back into the gaming section which means we need another $30 this week to feature in the gaming category (followed by another $400 for the following week to stay in the running). We could artificially push ourselves over this point, but I think that defeats the spirit of crowd funding and that’s not what we are about.</span></p>
<p><span lang=""EN-ZA""> </span></p>
<p><strong><span lang=""EN-ZA"">Getting Super Social </span></strong></p>
<p>What we are asking is for you to be active, to spread the word and to share the campaign via the Indiegogo tools, on social networks, blogs, and forums, &amp; everywhere you think it will make an impression. Talk to your friends and other gamers about it, like this campaign, love it, champion it and we will reinvest in your experience over and over again.</p>

That’s where my story should have ended had it not been for friends &amp; fellow creatives who decided to rally around me &amp; help me chase down this seemingly impossible dream. They are my ‘<a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/What-Is-Fiction?a=14828"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fictionaries</a>’ &amp; they have sacrificed their time &amp; resources for just over a year, so we could finish what I had started.</span></p>

<p><span lang=""EN-ZA"">This project has been blessed by the diverse talents of a handful of amazing people, and we have undoubtedly had our fair share of ups and downs. I can honestly say there have been points where I wanted to quit because the challenge of creating without financial backing was almost unbearable. But thankfully we didn’t and we never sold out to get the job done…  </span></p>

<h1><span lang=""EN-ZA"">Leading the way</span></h1>
<p><span lang=""EN-ZA"">They say it takes 10 000 hours to become a master at something. In my journey to get here I have amassed more than twice that amount. Seth Godin helped me to take ownership of what I had learned &amp; inspired me to dare to dream big enough &amp; change everything in my reality. </span></p>
<p>I began to realise that the economics of this new medium would have to be different in order for it to realise its full potential. There would need to be more balance &amp; constant redistribution of resources. So I made a rather selfless decision. I would own whatisfiction as much as it owns me. Fifty percent of all profits are mandated by the movement to be reinvested into the whatisfiction universe for the benefit of its patrons, while the remaining fifty percent will be paid out in remuneration for the work of active members, on a project-by-project basis.</p>
<p><span lang=""EN-ZA"">whatisfiction’s ground breaking nature means that the technology we were planning to incorporate into the whatisfiction universe would allow us to build a ‘New System’. Perhaps this may be very controversial to you or not, but it is inherently true.</span></p>

<h1>What is the Art of Revolution?</h1>
<p>We live in a world where material things have greater value than human life. Yet the irony is that Art is the only priceless commodity in our world - a resource that cannot be mined or mass produced that arises out of the tireless pursuit of seemingly impossible things, &amp; can never be ‘synced.’ Standing at the proverbial gates of our own Social Creative Revolution, some of us will choose to take responsibility &amp; begin to fix the mistakes of our forefathers.</p>
<p>The rules exist to be broken &amp; we must learn to live our own ‘fiction’. And when we do, the rules will begin to change. So my advice to you is that you keep evolving; start your own movement; lead your own tribe; build your own system; connect with us &amp; make this a global revolution. Mankind is now faced with new problems that can only be solved using new ways of thinking.</p>
<p>It’s time we start to make new choices &amp; change everything. I believe that one of the truest forms of Freedom is expressed by the choice to do something different. I am a man with nothing to lose &amp; if that’s what true Freedom tastes like, then think I shall drink my fill...</p>
<p>For those of you working in the film, TV, gaming, magic, music, IT &amp; other creative industries, the message is simple - ‘This project is history in the making’. Building it changes everything. The big question remains... Will you be a spectator or will you join us in breaking the mould forever???</p>

<h1>Here's to the crazy ones by Jack Kerouac...</h1>
<p>Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can praise them, disagree with them, quote them, disbelieve them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They invent. They imagine. They heal. They explore. They create. They inspire. They push the human race forward. Maybe they have to be crazy. How else can you stare at an empty canvas and see a work of art? Or sit in silence and hear a song that’s never been written? Or gaze at a red planet and see a laboratory on wheels? While some may dismiss this sort of behaviour as sheer madness, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are usually the ones who Do...</p>

<h1>RISE, The Revolution Starts Within</h1>
<h2>#BeatTheSystem</h2></div>","whatisfiction?
Hi my name is Jonny Eaglefeather and I am the brains behind one of the craziest, most ambitious gaming projects ever conceived. whatisfiction is a hybrid medium that combines alternate reality, augmented reality, mediated reality & personal reality gameplay experiences. What this means in laymen’s terms is that the ‘ultimate game’ takes place in the real world in multi reality universe.
The premise of using the real world as gaming platform is not a new idea. ARG’s have been around for well over a decade and they have already inspired some pretty insane experiences. What makes us instantly different, is our approach… whatisfiction is a mixed media movement, operating within a bold new partnership that bridges the gap between dance culture, gaming, reality television, film & the art of illusion.
 
A World First?
As you may have gathered this has never been attempted before and is clearly a ‘WORLD FIRST.’ The medium is powered by a clothing label called Deeper Meaning, which acts as an organic dispersal mechanism to distribute clues and items throughout the world itself; while simultaneously acting as one of the primary revenue streams to fund the whatisfiction universe.
It is a universe populated by players, the audience, brands and the various underpinnings of the five realities. I can promise you one thing, this will be like no other game you have ever played, or will ever play. If you dare to venture deep enough into our universe, it will inevitably change your ideas about reality itself.
 

Inside the whatisfiction Universe...
I bet most of you have imagined being some character on television or in the movies, perhaps even the hero or heroine. Traditionally the hero is on a mysterious quest, battling unknown forces, while travelling the four corners of the earth in search of the ultimate ‘prize’. whatisifiction takes this classic tale & digitally re-masters it for the 21st Century in a new medium that will take you well beyond virtual reality itself. whatisfiction is a hybrid medium that combines alternate reality, augmented reality, mediated reality & personal reality gameplay experiences.
An alternate reality game or ARG is an interactive narrative that uses the real world as a platform & makes use of ‘transmedia’ to deliver a story that can be altered by the ‘participants’ ideas or actions. Augmented reality or AR is a live, direct or indirect, view of the physical, real-world environment whose elements are fundamentally augmented by computer generated sensory input such as video, sound, graphics or GPS data.
 
A Future Game?
The whatisfiction universe consists of five levels of reality; the first two realities introduce you to the various levels of the Mind Game, the basic interactions of the new medium & also allow us to share key information about the whatisfiction universe. The other three realities will be where Ultimate Reality takes place, and where the game evolves even further, as the audience & players have to work closely together to unravel the inner mystery of whatisfiction.
The idea of a futuristic game isn’t new or even remotely farfetched by Hollywood standards. One of the earliest examples was 1975’s Roller Ball, but it didn’t end there. We also had The Running Man, Escape from New York, Starship Troopers, Star Wars Ep. 1 Phantom Menace, Death Race, Real Steel, Gamer & the Hunger Games, to name but a few.

A Race?
When I created whatisfiction I didn’t think that anyone else would be in the race toward the ultimate game, primarily because of the nature of the format. I was pleasantly surprised when Will Wright shared his game concept ‘HiveMind’ towards the end of 2011.  
For those of you who don’t know him by name, he is the legendary creator of the live simulation video games Sim City, the Sims & Spore. While our approaches differ radically we do still share a number of common ideas, primarily because he is one of my inadvertent teachers. 
You can click the hyperlink above to get an idea of how Will wants to shape the future of gaming… 
FATE = whatisfiction
 

DISCOVERING ‘Our’ Deeper Meaning?
Deeper Meaning is the culmination of that vision. It represents the ‘remarkable triumph’ of a fledgling creative movement to give life to a reality altering idea without ever having had ‘any real money’ to pursue, or even create said idea...
The key to the whatisfiction universe is a label called Deeper Meaning, which is VERY IMPORTANT...

Because we only ever make one hundred of any design.
The shirts are customised to suit your individuality with a personalised 6 digit code
The first edition shirts feature only twelve designs.
There are two types of special edition shirts: the first has hidden clues & the second comes with a unique graphical novel that offers vital clues to unlocking the twelve digital realms.
whatisfiction acts as a platform for artists to have their art immortalised as part of the whatisfiction Universe forever.
A dollar ($) from every piece of whatisfiction (Deep Meaning) merchandise sold is used to create the ‘greatest crowd funded jackpot of all time’ for the Ultimate Game. This jackpot will also be amplified through sponsorship deals with other affiliate brand partners. The deeper meaning label will see an exponential organic growth, without sacrificing the exclusivity of the experience & leading to over commercialisation.
We never waste money on advertising but rather choose to reinvest in your experience.

The Crux of the Matter
This campaign serves two purposes: (1stly) it is a funding tool to add much needed resources so we can grow our community before the launch of the Ultimate Game & (2ndly) to create global awareness about the project so we can secure the relevant big brand partners to create the entire whatisfiction universe.  
Why should you invest the time or the money to help us?
You should support us because we are the under dogs, the unknowns, the x-factor that no one anticipated and we are not offering you a one dimensional experience. While it may not be the easiest concept to wrap your head around, the chances of anyone ever attempting this again are slim to none. I can honestly say we not doing this to make ourselves rich and this experience goes way beyond money, so we feel that counts for something.
We want to make it to the number one spot on Indiegogo with your help, to do this we need to get back into the gaming section which means we need another $30 this week to feature in the gaming category (followed by another $400 for the following week to stay in the running). We could artificially push ourselves over this point, but I think that defeats the spirit of crowd funding and that’s not what we are about.
 
Getting Super Social 
What we are asking is for you to be active, to spread the word and to share the campaign via the Indiegogo tools, on social networks, blogs, and forums, & everywhere you think it will make an impression. Talk to your friends and other gamers about it, like this campaign, love it, champion it and we will reinvest in your experience over and over again.
Ideas that spread WIN – So if you believe in us then so will you…
 

Where is the Money Going?

‘whatisrevolution’ sticker pack campaigns for all new registrations on the whatisfiction.org website. So you can help us get super visible in a really awesome way for all concerned
The second goal will be to actualise our social media initiatives where we give back to our community as they create awareness about the project
Our third goal will be to setup a permanent base of operations for the movement to work from  
 

What is impossible?
This is not my first attempt at Indiegogo project my last campaign ‘Road to Fiction’ failed epically except for a solitary pledge of $20 by Emilio Barden. That’s where my story should have ended had it not been for friends & fellow creatives who decided to rally around me & help me chase down this seemingly impossible dream. They are my ‘fictionaries’ & they have sacrificed their time & resources for just over a year, so we could finish what I had started.
#teamwhatisfiction Present & Past 
Deniel Briers, Hamza Jacobs, Adrain Gemini, Antonio Del Rossi, Hadie Ismail, Marco Del Rossi, Duncan Nieuwstadt, Simone Maharaj, Peter JV R, Ashok Bali, Nanette Pistor, Jacques Sueur, Lea Z Frost, Michael Dupre, Ilse Violin, Armien Fakier, Zehra Fakier, Greg Boyle, Gizelle Loots, Taryn Conway Naurattel, Paul Wentzel, Michael Bredenhand, Jason Van Wyk, Karen Bouwer, Helene Fourie, Bianca Griebenow, Tahier Variawa.
This project has been blessed by the diverse talents of a handful of amazing people, and we have undoubtedly had our fair share of ups and downs. I can honestly say there have been points where I wanted to quit because the challenge of creating without financial backing was almost unbearable. But thankfully we didn’t and we never sold out to get the job done…  
 

Leading the way
They say it takes 10 000 hours to become a master at something. In my journey to get here I have amassed more than twice that amount. Seth Godin helped me to take ownership of what I had learned & inspired me to dare to dream big enough & change everything in my reality. 
I began to realise that the economics of this new medium would have to be different in order for it to realise its full potential. There would need to be more balance & constant redistribution of resources. So I made a rather selfless decision. I would own whatisfiction as much as it owns me. Fifty percent of all profits are mandated by the movement to be reinvested into the whatisfiction universe for the benefit of its patrons, while the remaining fifty percent will be paid out in remuneration for the work of active members, on a project-by-project basis.
whatisfiction’s ground breaking nature means that the technology we were planning to incorporate into the whatisfiction universe would allow us to build a ‘New System’. Perhaps this may be very controversial to you or not, but it is inherently true.

What is the Art of Revolution?
We live in a world where material things have greater value than human life. Yet the irony is that Art is the only priceless commodity in our world - a resource that cannot be mined or mass produced that arises out of the tireless pursuit of seemingly impossible things, & can never be ‘synced.’ Standing at the proverbial gates of our own Social Creative Revolution, some of us will choose to take responsibility & begin to fix the mistakes of our forefathers.
The rules exist to be broken & we must learn to live our own ‘fiction’. And when we do, the rules will begin to change. So my advice to you is that you keep evolving; start your own movement; lead your own tribe; build your own system; connect with us & make this a global revolution. Mankind is now faced with new problems that can only be solved using new ways of thinking.
It’s time we start to make new choices & change everything. I believe that one of the truest forms of Freedom is expressed by the choice to do something different. I am a man with nothing to lose & if that’s what true Freedom tastes like, then think I shall drink my fill...
For those of you working in the film, TV, gaming, magic, music, IT & other creative industries, the message is simple - ‘This project is history in the making’. Building it changes everything. The big question remains... Will you be a spectator or will you join us in breaking the mould forever???
 

Here's to the crazy ones by Jack Kerouac...
Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can praise them, disagree with them, quote them, disbelieve them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They invent. They imagine. They heal. They explore. They create. They inspire. They push the human race forward. Maybe they have to be crazy. How else can you stare at an empty canvas and see a work of art? Or sit in silence and hear a song that’s never been written? Or gaze at a red planet and see a laboratory on wheels? While some may dismiss this sort of behaviour as sheer madness, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are usually the ones who Do...
 

In Closing
If you want to know why I chased this idea, it’s because I know & believe that we can get there. I have done my best, given everything I have to give & more. This experience has undoubtedly been one of the hardest, most amazing experiences of my life & I really can’t say I have any regrets. I think that above all, I wanted to show people that you don’t need money to do remarkable things & that if you try hard enough you can make a difference in a unique way.

<h2>About the Game</h2>
<p><strong>Go Go Monkey Squad</strong> is an Endless Run &amp; Shooter game where you play as four monkeys interchangeably. You change between characters through swipe gestures.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to shoot enemies continuously to build up your combo. Once your combo ends, it rewards you with score depending on how long you managed to keep the combo going.</p>
<p>You also collect Bananas to unlock hats which work as upgrades to each monkey, providing bonuses such as an increase in rate of fire, or unlocking a special double jump ability!</p>
<h3>The Combo System</h3>
<p><img alt=""Combo System GIF"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/Zz1zA4z.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Shoot &amp; slash enemies continuously maintain a combo. The larger your combo is, the more points you get at the end of it. You must only take mere seconds between each hit, to count as part of a combo.<br/><br/>Once a long combo is broken, the environment will change and you will face new enemies and terrain.</p>
<h3>The 4-Monkey System</h3>
<p><img alt=""Switching GIF"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/2hpOySj.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>You are be able to swipe the screen upwards and downwards to switch between monkeys. It is an interesting mechanic, and a new concept, never before done in an endless runner game!</p>

<p>Each Monkey has their own Health Bar and you lose the game when all 4 monkeys die, or when you get pushed out of the screen.</p>
<h3>The Hat System</h3>
<p><img alt=""Hats GIF"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/hFrNYFj.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Each monkey can equip one hat item at once. Each hat has a unique design, and works as a unique upgrade to that monkey. For example, Equip Rico with a Cybotech Visor, and you may increase his attack range. Equip Malfozzo with a wizard hat, and he will shoot ice attacks instead of fire attacks. We're still looking into possibilities!</p>
<h3>Interactive Enemies</h3>
<p><img alt=""Interactive Enemies GIF"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/NMcnPLw.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We spend time and thought into each enemy and right now, we have an arsenal of enemies and ideas for enemies that involve more complex mechanics than simply - shoot this and it dies. We have Spike Turtles which die but remain as a ""spike"" obstacle. Bandit Turtles which throw axes while they are alive, but become a tool to attack enemies once they die!<br/><br/>We want to make each enemy special, and make the in-game experience truly challenging with replay value.</p>

<p>We're working on this full-time right now, we spend all our time creating a game that we hope you will want to play! We don't have any income, besides the money we earn from freelance work!</p>
<p>Despite this, we would really like to work with other artists, animators and musicians to create content for the game.</p>
<p>Right now we've got a gameplay demo fleshed out, and we have developed 2 levels and created art assets for another 3 out of the final 10 we're aiming for before release. We have no finalised Sound Effects and Music, and there is still a ton of polishing to do.</p>
<p>Your contribution will matter a lot to us now as it will allow us to focus all our time into developing the game.</p>
<p>It will allow us to hire a musician to create some great soundtracks for the game, it will take the burden off the licenses we need to purchase and so much more.</p>

For example, Equip Rico with a Cybotech Visor, and you may increase his attack range. Equip Malfozzo with a wizard hat, and he will shoot ice attacks instead of fire attacks. We're still looking into possibilities!
Interactive Enemies

We spend time and thought into each enemy and right now, we have an arsenal of enemies and ideas for enemies that involve more complex mechanics than simply - shoot this and it dies. We have Spike Turtles which die but remain as a ""spike"" obstacle. Bandit Turtles which throw axes while they are alive, but become a tool to attack enemies once they die!We want to make each enemy special, and make the in-game experience truly challenging with replay value.


Rory Soh is the main artist and programmer of Couch Knight. He has collaborated on many small projects with other game developers around the world, and created the engine ""Eclipse Origins"" alongside Robin Perris. He has a strong love for pixel art, illustration and any art. He is also the programmer for the game, using a tool called Construct 2, he is out to prove that anyone with an idea, can make a game.Yeo Xie Hang is the artist and level designer of Couch Knight, working alongside Rory to create more content and levels for the game. He is a passionate game developer who wants to pixel art his way into your hearts. In his free time, he plays tabletop games and hits the bar once very so often. But while he is working on the game, he will try not to be under the influence of alchohol.

We're working on this full-time right now, we spend all our time creating a game that we hope you will want to play! We don't have any income, besides the money we earn from freelance work!
Despite this, we would really like to work with other artists, animators and musicians to create content for the game.
Right now we've got a gameplay demo fleshed out, and we have developed 2 levels and created art assets for another 3 out of the final 10 we're aiming for before release. We have no finalised Sound Effects and Music, and there is still a ton of polishing to do.
Your contribution will matter a lot to us now as it will allow us to focus all our time into developing the game.
It will allow us to hire a musician to create some great soundtracks for the game, it will take the burden off the licenses we need to purchase and so much more.

<p>My name is Aaron Bolyard. I’m a 21-years-old self-educated programmer with years of experience in C, C++, C#, and Lua, and I’ve constructed my game, <em>Eight Seasons</em>, from scratch over the past two years, on and off. The unique experience delivered by my game is unparalleled, from one area to the next. Everything is carefully constructed by me—gameplay, graphics, storyline, and dialogue—except for audio (which is expertly composed by my brother). Regardless, the cohesive experience offered in <em>Eight Seasons</em> is truly unique once the adventure starts.</p>
<p>As the pitch video points out, I’m a games developer from the US with a passion for classic literature, such as <em>Paradise Lost</em> and the <em>Iliad</em>. Reading was not always my strong point, but when the “light bulb” finally turned on, I have had an endless thirst for literature of all kinds. Still, the classics always remain close to my heart.</p>
<p>My video game strives to be a modern rendition of the classic epic form. However, unlike <em>Paradise Lost</em> in which there is only one outcome, my game will have many ways of interacting and changing the progression of events.</p>
<p>You can get a feel of the game already by trying out a recent demo! <a href=""http://commaexcess.com/games/13/eight-seasons"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Check it out here.</a></p>

<p>Much of the inspiration of <em>Eight Seasons</em> comes from my mom—a strong-willed woman who is close to finishing her English Literature degree. Indeed, her very personality is entwined within the game’s protagonist, Haiku.</p>
<p>So, contributions to my game—be it a small comment, constructive criticism, or funds—will ensure that I can realize the dream of sharing my passion with others. I wholeheartedly believe that poetry is not reserved for English class, and my game strives to reinforce this sentiment.</p>
<p><strong>So, why do I need help?</strong></p>
<p><em>Eight Seasons</em> may be a game, but it is also an experience. To properly render this experience, I need resources that unfortunately are generally a bit pricy. A large portion of the goal is to be used on sound effects and music.</p>
<p>My brother is the composer of this project, and the tools he uses are dated. Reaching the goal would ensure I can get him the software (such as Reason), the content (such as samples and sounds), and even hardware (such as a MIDI keyboard) that would allow him to fully realize the musical potential of the game.</p>
<p>There’s also other miscellaneous costs, such as submission to Steam Greenlight and software licensing, that add up.</p>
<p>Contributions are not unrewarded, however! Each contribution will be rewarded, be it with thanks or a gift:</p>
<ul>
<li>At $8, you get to updated beta copies of the game, and when the full game is released, you’ll get to have it.</li>
<li>A little more and you get  specialized wallpapers featuring concept art.</li>
<li>Up from there and you get prints of game artwork.</li>
<li>The last notch is a copy of the soundtrack to be released upon completion of the game!</li>
</ul><p>Of course, there is always the threat of the game not reaching its funding goal. In this case, the game will take longer to realize than intended (by how much is to be seen). I will still continue updating the game, but it would have to be put on the backburner, which sadly means that progress will be much slower.</p>
<p><strong>How helping me will help you!</strong></p>
<p>Aside from the perks, each contribution is a small (or large) step towards seeing the game completed. The game itself, as stressed previously, is an experience that strives to merge two seemingly different forms—poetry and interactivity—into one unique rendition.</p>

<b>What is ""Missing Translation""?</b>  // <b>¿Qué es ""Missing Translation""?</b><br/>
</h3>
<br/>It's an upcoming game that will be launched on Android and PC.<br/><br/>It's inspired on classic PC point &amp; click games, but also on FEZ <img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>
 and other modern titles. There's some plot behind it but it's pretty 
abstract, it's all centered around puzzles. The game introduces a couple
 of different sets of mental challenges, each of these sets has 
different rules and mechanics, if you get stuck or don't like a certain 
type of puzzle you can just skip it and come back later.<br/><br/>We are 
making it accessible to everyone(not too hard to complete with some 
effort), but we'll also add several hardcore puzzles with really cool 
rewards for people who seek a greater challenge. It doesn't mind what 
kind of player you are, we'll have suitable content for everyone to 
enjoy if you give us a chance.<br/><br/>//<br/><br/>Es un juego que lanzaremos próximamente en Android y PC.<br/><br/>Está inspirado en juegos clásicos de aventuras para ordenador, pero también en FEZ y otros títulos modernos. Hay un argumento, pero es bastante abstracto, todo está centrado alrededor de los puzles. El juego presenta varios sets distintos de retos mentales, si te atascas o no te gusta un cierto tipo de puzle puedes saltártelo y volver luego.<br/><br/>Estamos haciendo el juego accesible para todos los jugadores(no es demasiado difícil con un poco de esfuerzo), pero también añadiremos algunos puzles más hardcore con recompensas interesantes para la gente que quiera un reto mayor. No importa el tipo de jugador que seas, si nos das la oportunidad, tendremos contenido de sobra para que todo el mundo lo disfrute.<br/><br/>BSO Preview<br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""580"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fw.soundcloud.com%2Fplayer%2F%3Fvisual%3Dtrue%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fapi.soundcloud.com%252Ftracks%252F148864444%26show_artwork%3Dtrue&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Falbert-fv%2Fthe-town-is-sleeping&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.sndcdn.com%2Fartworks-000079034223-wvkc8s-t500x500.jpg%3Fe76cf77&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=soundcloud"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><br/><p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Why do we need the money? // ¿Por qué necesitamos el dinero?<br/>

<h3>Why should I give you money? // ¿Por qué debería daros dinero?<br/>

<br/>We're just three developers who don't have much experience yet, but we're doing what we love and we are pretty sure you'll enjoy ""Missing Translation"".

We need 240€ for the booth, but the minimum we can ask on Indiegogo is 500 USD (~370€). The whole campaign was made in a few hours, so we might need to fix some details.

Update #1: A message from the artist 
What is ""Missing Translation""?  // ¿Qué es ""Missing Translation""?

It's an upcoming game that will be launched on Android and PC.It's inspired on classic PC point & click games, but also on FEZ 
 and other modern titles. There's some plot behind it but it's pretty 
abstract, it's all centered around puzzles. The game introduces a couple
 of different sets of mental challenges, each of these sets has 
different rules and mechanics, if you get stuck or don't like a certain 
type of puzzle you can just skip it and come back later.We are 
making it accessible to everyone(not too hard to complete with some 
effort), but we'll also add several hardcore puzzles with really cool 
rewards for people who seek a greater challenge. It doesn't mind what 
kind of player you are, we'll have suitable content for everyone to 
enjoy if you give us a chance.//Es un juego que lanzaremos próximamente en Android y PC.Está inspirado en juegos clásicos de aventuras para ordenador, pero también en FEZ y otros títulos modernos. Hay un argumento, pero es bastante abstracto, todo está centrado alrededor de los puzles. El juego presenta varios sets distintos de retos mentales, si te atascas o no te gusta un cierto tipo de puzle puedes saltártelo y volver luego.Estamos haciendo el juego accesible para todos los jugadores(no es demasiado difícil con un poco de esfuerzo), pero también añadiremos algunos puzles más hardcore con recompensas interesantes para la gente que quiera un reto mayor. No importa el tipo de jugador que seas, si nos das la oportunidad, tendremos contenido de sobra para que todo el mundo lo disfrute.BSO Preview   Why do we need the money? // ¿Por qué necesitamos el dinero?

We need 240€ to showcase our game at Madrid Games Week, a huge gaming event with AAA games. Since ""Missing Translation"" is going to be free, we don't have enough money for the booth.//Necesitamos 240€ para presentar nuestro juego en Madrid Games Week, un evento enorme de videojuegos con muchos proyectos comerciales. Como ""Missing Translation"" va a ser gratis, no podemos pagar el stand.
  
Why should I give you money? // ¿Por qué debería daros dinero?

We're just three developers who don't have much experience yet, but we're doing what we love and we are pretty sure you'll enjoy ""Missing Translation"". Supporting the campaign you will help us get more exposure and keep growing as devs :)//Sólo somos tres desarrolladores que no tienen mucha experiencia todavía, pero estamos haciendo lo que amamos y estamos bastante seguros de que disfrutaréis ""Missing Translation"". Apoyando la campaña nos ayudáis a ser conocidos y a crecer como desarrolladores :)
  Risks and challenges // Riesgos y desafíos
The game should be finished before October ends, we might wait for a month to fix some bugs before releasing it. All the campaign rewards are separated from the game, so even if something happened to the project you'd get what you paid for.//El juego deberia estar acabado antes de que acabe Noviembre, puede que esperásemos un mes más antes de lanzarlo para arreglar errores. Todas las recompensas de la campaña están separadas del juego, así que si algo le pasase al proyecto obtendríais lo pagado.

<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>Abandoned is a 2d top down puzzle horror game about a guy called Nick. For more information about the story, please read 'The Story' down below.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>The Beginning:</h3>
<p>I started talking with a friend about how cool it would be to make my own horror game, because normally I only make shooters and puzzle games. So he said that it would be pretty awesome, so a week later I went on vacation and I started to write the story line. I kinda wanted to affect the story line on my biggest fear: horror movies/games. I played Amnesia: The Dark Descent, and I was horrified. So I wrote the story, and added all the things that I personally find scary so that I could know that the finished product would be my game. Not a random game, but my game.</p>

It was raining and he couldn't open the door, the busses didn't come at this late hour and it was too far to walk home. He had to find shelter, but how?</span></p>
