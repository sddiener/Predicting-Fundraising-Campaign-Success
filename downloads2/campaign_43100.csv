But its not only about selling, Right? When we all started Útopy we only had one goal in mind: to create a clothing store in the image and likeness of Instagram community, in which anyone, anywhere and anytime could take part ofÚTOPY is an idea that arose spontaneously from the market itself, from its demands. Observing the internet, its needs, tendencies and its people, and following with naturality the way of our society in this internet era we soon understood that people do demanded new clothes and styles, but in a different way World changes, market changes,the consumer changes and companies as well must do so. We understand that nowadays a clothing store can not just promote clothes and send it into a box, but also cultivate a community to contribute something to the consumer besides the mere product. As informing you about global styles at real time, meeting you with people of similar tastes, or even alowing you to monetize your time on social media with your own products or collections (more below) In response to the lack of brands disposed to adapt to new audiovisual media, the UTOPY project took a step forward to integrate itself into social networks as just another user. Environments intended for people such as Facebook or Instagram have gone from having a clean atmosphere to becoming invasive and direct advertising spaces for companies that have not renewed their ways of treating people We believe that there are other ways and we refuse to enter the game of traditional advertising media, Our utopian objective, only possible in the century of the commercial revolution, can not be more than one: to change the world of fashion and to create community by a social way by listening to our people and formenting interactions between our own clients Neon is light, youth and the symbol of our 90's generation,Útopy is multi-style, however there are things that we not debate: Youthful style, energetic and lively. To please the senses without obeying canons. Chaos within an order. Ordered chaos. Emphasis on colors pleasing aesthetically through the atmosphereÚTOPY is a labyrinth of designs and trends where we show the most commented and trendy clothes in every country at real time. If you know ÚTOPY, you know the prevailing style in social media, always with our youthful and colorful aesthetic bet, we do not just keep up appearances moving in a generic spectrum of styleSome of our FOR HIM collection.Some of our FOR HER collection.  Finally monetize instagram influence!,In ÚTOPY there are permanent and seasonal collections, awesome designs, trendy products but ... as ÚTOPY was Made in Instagram and for Instagram ÚTOPY is a mirror of it: it is molded in the likeness of its medium and will allow you (influencer or private) to open your own collection or present your own design with which, as with the photos on your profile, try to convince friends, acquaintances and strangers, or maybe, to the whole world!

Each one will be free to give visibility or promote their collection or designs and thanks to the 50-50 commission of each sale they will be able to monetize their time and interactions in their preferred social app  We value the world in which we live, and we are aware that we must take care of it. We do not live outside the concerns of out there. With your help we want to:

A perfectly tailored look that could be worn in a casual or professional setting
The highest quality fabrics. 
Offering the T-Shirts at a price less than half what our competitor's cost

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>STORY</strong></h3>
<p>Hi there! I'm Lorenda. I came up with the idea for the Ella Dane diaper bag during my search for the perfect fashionable diaper bag while expecting my first child. I wanted something unique, functional and affordable so this inspired me to start work on my own design. </p>
<p>Within a year, I created the very first design which I decided to sell on etsy in small quantities. My customers loved this bag and it soon became popular among some mom groups. However, through my experience as a mom, I realized it needed more functional features, so I decided to improve  the design.</p>
<p>After 3 years of constant improvements, driven by market research and feedback from moms, I've arrived at the perfect design. A durable, stylish and lightweight leather diaper bag that meets the needs of moms on the go. The original version has evolved into something I know you'll love! This bag’s versatility makes it much more than a diaper bag. It’s perfect for anyone!</p>
<p>Demand for this bag continues to increase and in order to produce the new edition of the bag at a higher volume, we need to reach our campaign goal. With your help and contribution, we can manufacture the next batch of these amazing bags.</p>

<p><b><u>OUR STORY</u></b></p>

Years later after both finished their university degrees, Gracia and her brother were planning to create their fashion brand, the idea came alive again after Gracia and her brother used to go shopping for Frank’s daughters dresses since she was a baby. Gracia was looking for classy dresses at an affordable price to teach her niece to dress chic. They had great difficulty finding the perfect dress designs made with the perfect material for a reasonable price, she either found that the dresses were made with high quality but not reasonably priced or the dresses were not chic or classy and made of poor quality but affordable. While Gracia and Frank were working on the launch of their project Frank was unexpectedly taken from his family. In Frank’s loving memory and in honor of her brother’s greatest love, Gracia and her husband decided to continue with the project and named the fashion house with his 3-year-old daughter’s name. In 2017, “ Maya Montero “ was established in <a href=""#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Toronto</a>, <a href=""#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Canada</a>.</p>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","We always make trade-offs when we buy girls dresses, either we buy expensive designer dresses made of expensive material for special occasions that we don’t want the kids running around in or playing outside while wearing or we buy them low cost clothing which usually isn’t pretty enough to wear to special occasions.
At Maya Montero - Toronto we don't like those choices, so we provide designer dresses for women and their little angels, made from the finest materials, with the newest design trends for a reasonable price.

<h2>What Will We Do With the Funds?</h2>
<p>After a year of research and development, we've designed 6 timeless pieces to meet all the needs of your daily life. All sustainable production materials have been sourced and prototypes are in its final stage. We have partnered with an all-female production team who have the same values to ensure everything is handled with care.<br/><br/>We're launching on Indiegogo as a pre-order with the slow fashion mindset. In order to reduce our carbon footprint, only materials required in production will be ordered. We're excited to embark on our journey of sustainable fashion with you. Select your reward now at the exclusive Indiegogo price!</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Risks and Challenges</h2>
<p><strong>Production</strong>: There are a multitude of risks in apparel production. We've partnered with a local manufacturing team to minimize lead times. As two perfectionists, we have strict quality control in place and will not ship out a piece that has not passed our tests. We thank you in advance for your patience and kindness while we work through running a small business, given the current situation. Some delays may arise due to the changing restrictions and regulations, but we will keep you updated on a monthly basis.</p>
<p><strong>Fit</strong>: We understand there is a risk to buying clothes online. We've selected materials with stretch to accommodate all body types. </p>
<p><strong>Sizing</strong>: We will gladly accept exchanges for the same pieces in a different size if they are unworn with tags on.</p>

 We tested several different types of Tourbillon movements before choosing the automatic Tourbillon caliber #3C40E.  The limited edition Strumenti Nautici Automatic Tourbillon will only be available in limited quantities of 100 pieces per color variation.  Each case will be individually numbered.    CASE for STRUMENTI NAUTICI TITANIUM TOURBILLONWe chose to use Titanium because it's around 30% stronger and around 40% lighter than steel. Combined with other metals to produce high performance alloys, Titanium is commonly used by the aerospace industry and military for its lightweight strength and ability to withstand extreme temperatures.  

Diameter:  Approximately 46mm  

Height:  Approximately 15mm

Material:  Grade 2 Titanium with Cerakote coating finish

Crown:  Double crown seal

Crystal:  Flat sapphire glass coated with anti-glare.

Date Setter:  Quick change date setter located on the right side of the case around the 2 o'clock position.  3D printed pusher included.  The pusher is 3D printed in the United States.

Water Resistance:  Up to 20ATM / 200M / 660FT 
  CERAKOTE for STRUMENTI NAUTICI TITANIUM TOURBILLONCerakote is a process using ceramic and a polymer to create a coating that allows us to achieve the dynamic colors on our Titanium cases.  You'll have the option to choose between a single solid color or a two color combination of the shown examples in this project.
Solid grade 2 Titanium Cerakote engraved case back
Screw down case back
Individually numbered case back 
     WATER RESISTANCE of STRUMENTI NAUTICI TITANIUM TOURBILLONThe Strumenti Nautici Tourbillon is rated up to 20 ATM / 200 M / 660 FT which allows you to enjoy a variety of outdoor activities and water sports.      The Titanium Strumenti Nautici Automatic Tourbillon features a date setter on the right side of the case located around the 2 o'clock position.  This is great for quick changing the date without having to turn the hands for a full 24 hours until you reach the desired date.  We created and tested pin pushers in various lengths.  We found the short pin pushers work the best.  We 3D print our pin pushers in the United States and only print as many as we need.  Our unconventional pin pushers are more expensive and take longer to receive, however it allows us to cut down on waste.  It takes approximately 3 to 4 weeks to 3D print our pin pushers.    REWARDS with YOUR STRUMENTI NAUTICI TITANIUM TOURBILLONYour color choice of either a solid Cerakote colored case or a two colored Cerakote case - red and black, black and white, yellow and white, blue and white.  You also have an option of titanium only without Cerakote.  Choose your case color at the end of the project.  Choose the strap color you want for your watch - red, black, or grey.
PRODUCTION and DELIVERY SCHEDULE

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our goal was to create a filament for 3D printing with high percentage of wood content.

</div>
<div>
<h3>TESTING PROCEDURE</h3>
<p>When trying to come up with a new mixture for 3D printing filament, a lot of different parameters were had to be taken into consideration. </p>
<p>Step by step, we established a testing protocol, which every wood type had and will have to pass in order to be even considered for a later test extrusion. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We tested the temperature responsiveness of wood types themselves, the interaction of wood, the lignin inside the wood, and the added bio adhesives, all according to different temperature changes. Than we tested the wood type’s interaction with PLA and other bio polymers as a function of temperature, and the material’s durability was tested before and after each test. </p>
<h3>BIODEGRADABLE</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Those biopolymers are 100% biodegradable, naturally that goes for the wooden part of the filament as well. The tests of biodegradability and recyclability were conducted in controlled laboratory environment - respirometer (controlled air temperature, humidity and atmospheric pressure) under changing boundary conditions. The product will decay in 60-90 days when exposed to the right outdoor conditions. So don’t make any support beams for your shed with it, or you may find your roof on the ground in a month or so. </p>
<h3>COLOUR CHANGE/TEMPERATURE</h3>
<p>When doing our lab experiments, we were already aware, that certain types of filament change their colour due to temperature of printing. We were however surprised, when we found out, that this mixture of biopolymers and wood reacts consistently with the right temperature.</p>
<p>In other words, the colour stays the same when the extruder head’s temperature does not deviate too much. So, want to print in different colour with the same filament? Choose WO-FI!</p>
<h3>COMPATIBILITY</h3>
<p>The mixture that is latter used in our filament was carefully chosen, so that the characteristics of the filament would not differ too much from the existing ones on the market. We wanted to create something new, but still compatible with most 3D printers – meaning, that the diameter will be set at 1,75 mm, and that the printing temperatures will be set at 170° C to 210°C. The filament will come in 0,5 kg and 1 kg variety, so that you can test it first completely before moving on and buying a larger filament more suitable for you needs. The first prototype was tested on multiple 3D printers, and the results were encouraging.</p>

Hi everyone, we are       
        Jure                  and Rok.             
As for the movie goes: ""Dammit Jim, I am an engineer, not an actor!""
We are two young engineers from Slovenia, each specialised in its own field of study (Rok studied chemical engineering, and Jure studied geology). Our combined knowledge was enough to get us through most of the obstacles in the field and in the laboratory.
We would like to introduce our idea, in which we are trying to produce a 3D printing filament, that would have a high percentage of wood in it and would consist of only one wood type.


Nowadays, 3D printing is already knocking on your own front doors, it has become affordable to almost anybody. The eye to hand coordination is no longer needed, you don’t have to excel in sculpture or in carpentry. You only need to know how to get your idea from your head on to a computer, and 3D printing capabilities to extract it from your computer into reality. 
But (this may sound old to you) there is a catch. The filaments for the 3D printers are very expensive, the special hybrid ones in particular, but NOT WO-FI. It will be affordable for everyone. 
WO-FI (as we like to call it), stands for wood filament and is a new type of filament for 3D printing. It has the highest percentage of wood content on the world market, it is made entirely of one wood type (example: pine, spruce, beech) It is biodegradable, recyclable and above all, environmental friendly!



FEATURES 

(Why should you choose WO-FI?)


Highest wood % on the market



Biodegradable

Recyclable







Different wood types are used (would you like some pine with that oak, Sir?)



Different colour according to the printing temperature


(Note that the colours on the Chart are not the ones you get during printing)
No odour







IN DEPTH ANALYSIS
(get to know WO-FI quite a bit better)

WOOD CONTENT
Our goal was to create a filament for 3D printing with high percentage of wood content. As you know, the highest nowadays wood filaments made by others have reached a good 38 % of wood content. But our formula is better – we have reached a 50% wood content! The other half consist of a mixture of biopolymers.

Bringing an extra insulated lunch bag is not only inconvenient, but it is also not very fashionable!!</p><h3>Problem solved:</h3><p>ISOLARÉ bags are high quality, fashion-forward handbags that all have a secret insulated compartment where you can stash your healthy snacks so that no matter where you end up in your day, you will be prepared. You can truly grab and go, avoid the blood sugar melt-down, stay focused, stay on your diet, or even sneak your treats into the movie theatre! Not only is the compartment insulated, it is completely isolated so you can store items that you don’t want to co-mingle with the rest of your purse contents:</p><ul>
<li>Isolate your makeup and cosmetics from the rest of your purse</li>
<li>Prevent candy or protein bars that are covered in chocolate from melting</li>
<li>Take your leftovers from the restaurant without worrying about spilling in your purse or having to “carry the box”</li>
<li>Grab a snack or meal for later when you are in a place where you won’t have a chance to buy food</li>
<li>Bring healthy choices to the movie theatre</li>
<li>Stick to your diet by making it easy to pack food from home</li>

I took a break, got my MBA, and decided I wanted to learn how to make things, all sorts of things…from Starbucks aprons, to FDA approved medical devices, to tablet computers…and that’s just what I did. The next 11 years, I experienced countless visits to China and other countries around the world (all while eating things you couldn’t imagine!), sourcing safe and reliable factories and manufacturers for major brands, discovering my passion. I love making products for people that you can touch, test, smell and fall in love with.</p><p>The next step in this evolution, was to find partners to make my own products instead of doing it for the big boys. Fortunately, I found Liz, who complements me in the things I lack. I will be making these purses with the highest quality in mind and done in a safe working environment. I know this because I will be there on the line when we make these purses. I hope you enjoy them as much as I love making them, and I hope to hear from you.</p><p><strong>Liz Fitzwater – Design, Marketing, Product Development</strong></p><p>Before college I worked in retail. I loved everything about the signage, merchandising, the products and the shopping experience. So much so, that I went to school for graphic design so that I could be a part of the retail industry.

Bringing an extra insulated lunch bag is not only inconvenient, but it is also not very fashionable!!Problem solved:ISOLARÉ bags are high quality, fashion-forward handbags that all have a secret insulated compartment where you can stash your healthy snacks so that no matter where you end up in your day, you will be prepared. You can truly grab and go, avoid the blood sugar melt-down, stay focused, stay on your diet, or even sneak your treats into the movie theatre! Not only is the compartment insulated, it is completely isolated so you can store items that you don’t want to co-mingle with the rest of your purse contents:
Isolate your makeup and cosmetics from the rest of your purse
Prevent candy or protein bars that are covered in chocolate from melting
Take your leftovers from the restaurant without worrying about spilling in your purse or having to “carry the box”
Grab a snack or meal for later when you are in a place where you won’t have a chance to buy food
Bring healthy choices to the movie theatre
Stick to your diet by making it easy to pack food from home
A place to stick your kid’s (or your own) retainer or another gross thing that you don’t want in your purse!
Cut down on one of the many bags you need for your day!

And devices, built-in shorts, work as a compact solar power storage (SPS). SPS is made of eco-plastic, which are biodegradable materials.Your support very important for us!Solar power storage can charged only from the sun and will always be at your fingertips. And what is the most important, SPS can help you out at any time if you need to recharge any gadget.Eco Shorts are sewn in the only one color ""Royal Blue"", which perfectly blends with the surface of solar panels.Eco Shorts are suitable for all occasionsEco Shorts are perfect for going for a walk, for travelling, running or just relaxing outside. If you are planning a romantic evening and you need stricter outfit - Eco Shorts will cope with this task!The advantage for travelers in our Eco Shorts is the Solar Power Storage. It doesn't matter where you go and for how long, there will always be a rechargeable source of power with you.Why Eco Shorts?The initial goal was to create shorts with environmentally friendly material, which is produced without harming to the environment. Our choice has become a hemp fabric, made from agricultural industrial hemp.Its useful to note - hemp is not weed. Hemp is more likely marijuana’s friend which does not contain cannabis cells, that makes it absolutely legal throughout the world.Few people know that, for many centuries, people have used hemp for the production of various products, because it has incredible features of a medicinal plant! And on the basis of its seeds, many healthy food products and just things are produced all over the world.Eco fabric is 100% naturalClothing made from hemp - is primarily a natural environmentally friendly product. Cannabis stems consist of two parts - fiber and pulp. It is from fiber made the fabric for all types of clothing. And most importantly - all the useful properties of hemp saved when processing it into fabric.Durability & HypoallergenicHemp material is soft and very durable, absorbs moisture quickly and is hypoallergenic. It has healing effects on the human body (calms the nervous system and has an antiseptic effect and UV protection), and with prolonged use they increase. For good reason manufacturers of children's goods are gradually introduce hemp into children's hygiene items.Using hemp fabric constantly, it is activated and maintains the ability to neutralize toxins, preventing development of pathogenic microbes, does not create obstacles for the metabolic processes in the skin.HygienicHygienic provides natural membrane: natural fabric does not create a ""greenhouse"" effect on the surface of the body under clothing which allows the skin to breathe freely. And what is the most interesting thing that hemp fabric eliminates overheating of the body in hot weather and hypothermia in the cold time of the year.100% Pure HempOur country, like many others around the world, included in the list of countries prohibited to grow hemp, but only from the Canabis family. We use technical hemp varieties for the production of fabrics.It should be noted, if you look at the history of 400 years ago, you can make sure that technical hemp varieties were mandatory for growing. The fabric of these varieties was considered the most durable and useful for the skin.Usefulness in all areas of lifeHemp is used in construction: decoration, plaster and insulation. Also medicine from cancer related diseases develops on the base of hemp. Specifically, hemp oil is actively used as the main ingredient in cosmetics and cooking.Our shorts are sewn exclusively from 100% hemp fiber, without adding additional threads and other materials. You can make sure in declared quality - supporting us and our project.Every detail of EcoShorts is uniqueUseful properties of EcoShorts
The fabric of technical varieties of hemp fibers differs in durability.
Endurance of material is supported by the special structure of hemp fibers from which the fabric is made. It is resistant to external influences, does not deform and does not deteriorate in the washing machine.
Wash at 40°C. Washing at a higher temperature can slightly settle fabric.
Eco fabric from hemp is ideal for sensitive skin and for allergy. It is breathable, soft and hardwearing. It doesn’t irritate the skin and has an antimicrobial effect.
It warms in the cold and cools in the heat.
Does not get bobbles and does not need special care.
It wrinkles like all natural fabrics, as it is not treated with caustic soda against creasing. Caustic soda is prohibited by BIO certificates.
It is pleasant to wear and easy to care.
Organic natural dye is certified by the GOTs standard, free of heavy metals and harmful substances. The fabric doesn’t change its view with proper care for many years.
Eco Shorts have the property of protection against ultraviolet rays. The fabric filters most of the spectrum of ultraviolet rays. In particular, UV-B rays that affect premature skin aging and may be carcinogenic.
Therapeutic and prophylactic qualities of hemp fabric

Hypoallergenic. It is achieved due to the absence of toxic chemicals in plant materials used to control weeds, pests and diseases of cultivated plants.

Hygiene. It is provided by the features of a natural membrane. Natural tissue doesn’t create a “greenhouse” effect on the body surface under clothing, which allows the skin to breathe freely.

Protection. It is installed with the help the barrier properties of hemp as a medicinal plant. The fabric protects the skin from the harmful effects of the external environment (heavy metal salts, unfavorable combination of temperature and humidity, damaging effect of excessive ultraviolet radiation).
Additional benefits: refreshing and softening action of living tissue, which beneficially affects the body's work during the day; lack of irritation on the skin; general tonic effect at constant wear.
Ecological cultureHemp is a completely ecological culture. It is grown without the use of chemistry, which guarantees high-quality fibers without toxic residues. After all, toxic residues are a source of allergies and skin irritations.Pricing policy for hemp fabricDue to the fact that hemp fabric produces a fairly small percentage of companies around the world, its prices are higher than other fabrics.

</div></div>","Buying VISUAL ASSISTANT (VA/VA glasses) provides you with not only a prescription-ready eyewear frame, but a choice of a variety of interchangeable polarized sunscreen filters as well as a filter for bad weather conditions.     If you broke or lost any parts of your system - you can easily order any part you need from our online store as well as any additional new clip-ons. All new clip-on filters will always be compatible with our one universal VA frame!    
90% of all the information that our senses deliver to us is picked up via our eyesight. More interestingly, 60% of people wear glasses, contact lenses or both.  
FACT: More than 1 million car accidents occur each year in the United States alone - with poor eyesight being identified as the sole cause for nearly 20% of all auto accidents.       
VA glasses use strong magnets to easily attach clip-on filters that provide perfect high definition vision, protection from the sun and most importantly - increased perception of your surroundings on the road in bad weather conditions.   
 
VA glasses are prescription-ready. Just take them into your optometrist and they will be able to add prescription lenses into your VA frame for you (read our FAQs).     In the frame and clip-on filters are embedded small but strong magnets that provide an instant, convenient and reliable attachment of the clip-on filter onto the VA frame.    
VISUAL ASSISTANT will instantly attach the clip-on and can be changed with a single hand in order to ensure your attention is always on the road. 
 
Entering a tunnel or a parking garage? Quickly remove your clip-on to regain the appropriate vision necessary for whatever environment you may be in!
 
(VA glasses do use magnets. If you have any condition that precludes using magnets near your head or body, you should talk to your doctor)
 
 


 
We all know what it's like to drive with obstructed vision due to extreme weather conditions. 
VISUAL ASSISTANT eliminates this type of dangerous and distracted driving that claims the lives of so many people each year.
 

 
Our versatile optic frame can be instantly customized via polarized magnetic clip-ons that are used to adapt it to any environment you may find yourself in.
 

 
 

 


 
VISUAL ASSISTANT offers several unique filters created for different weather environments.
 

 
As stated above, the filters can quickly be swapped out with each other with a single hand.
 

Unlike competitors, VA’s filters fit the single frame, eliminating the need to purchase additional frame shapes and sizes. 
 

VISUAL ASSISTANT features a universal black squared frame with a bridge in the form of a keyhole that fits virtually every customer. 

Just take an eye exam and order lenses with your prescription to fit the VA frame.
 

While it is true that the VA frame is available in one universal style, the variety of magnetic & polarized clip-ons available to be installed makes VISUAL ASSISTANT one of the most customizable pair of sunglasses ever to hit the market. 
Each filter is unique in terms of both color and the degree of dimming that it offers. As different environments & individual preferences call for different filters, these clip-ons allow VISUAL ASSISTANT to be the only versatile sunglasses you’ll ever need.
 

 
We are also working on expanding the list of clip-on filters!
All new filters will be compatible with the VA frame and will be available for purchase separately. 
 
The following 6 colors will be available for VA glasses at launch (expected)*: 

 

 With the exception of those clip-ons made for smog and bad weather conditions.
 
The smog & bad weather clip-on (the yellow lens tint) makes your environment appear brighter and is commonly used in low-light conditions. These lens’ tint block blue light, reduce glare, enhance contrast and depth perception, which make them helpful for overcast, hazy and foggy conditions. 
 

(*The colors could be different from the picture. Final color schemes will be provided in updates. Your colors of clip-on lenses will be selected in a survey that will be sent out at the end of the campaign.)

Poly-carbonate lenses are the perfect choice for driving, cycling and sports activities. They are valued for exceptional durability, lightness, optical transparency and large tolerance of high temperatures. They offer 100% protection from UV rays. 
 

Polarized lenses are the most high-tech type of lens product that allow you to equip your eyes with maximum protection from excessive sunlight and reflected light.

Despite all of the known benefits we receive from the sun, its light can still cause serious vision problems. Sunlight reflecting off of smooth water, snow or flat roads can create glare which is not only annoying but can often be dangerous. Blinding sun glare can cause accidents, snow blindness and can even give your eyes sunburn.  
 

 
Polarized lenses effectively block glare resulting from light reflecting from flat and smooth surfaces. Consequently, they provide increased transparency of vision. 
Polarized sunglasses can be helpful for driving, because they reduce glare-causing reflections from flat surfaces, such as the hood of the car or the road's surface.
 


 
One of the main advantages of polarizing lenses is the effect of reducing eye strain. Since most harmful rays of light are blocked, the eyes strain less and their fatigue decreases.  Eye strain often leads to headaches and a general deterioration of well-being.
 


Whether you spend your time driving or jogging, in-line skating or mountain biking - polarized sunglasses are the right choice to help you enjoy your life outdoors.
In terms of comfort, polarizing lenses are superior to ordinary sunglasses, which, although they protect the eyes from bright sunlight, do not remove the interfering glitter.
 

Only the most high-quality, lightweight and safe materials are used for the production of VA Glasses, ensuring maximum comfort for long periods of wear. There are no hooks or other heavy constructions to the frame. 

VISUAL ASSISTANT is made of ULTEM® (Polyetherimide Plastic) - an extremely light and durable material that offers exceptional thermal-resistance, stiffness and resistance to chemicals. This material is Eco-friendly, light, and flexible.
 


You will never have to overpay for bundles with filters you don’t need to replace your current one.  
Each filter is unique in terms of both color and the degree of dimming that it offers. As different environments  & individual preferences call for different filters, these clip-ons allow VISUAL ASSISTANT to be the only versatile sunglasses you’ll ever need.   
 

Do you want to try a new lens color? 
Broke the frame or lost your favorite clip-on filter? 
With VA Glasses it's not a problem!
 

 

 We are still working on the final list of clip-on color tints. Any additional color in the future will be compatible to VA frame and can be purchased separately from VISUAL ASSISTANT online store.

<p>Have you ever felt that you knew someone’s character by just looking at their shoes?</p>
<p>Footwear is a <strong>symbol of identity </strong>that reveals a vast part of our <strong>personalities</strong>. At Zulus Republic we do not just aim at producing a product that becomes simply a fashion trend, but rather a shoe  with a historical significance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558354200/hcnzzsy5xgti1qrzgeb3.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The birth of Zulus Republic all started with my love for shoes, creating my own designs with brilliant patterns and my passion about the African &amp; Spanish culture and making our environment sustainable.</p>
<p>Born in <strong>Edo state, Nigeria </strong>where colors represent not just our clothes but culture, music,and simply everything that we are.</p>

<p>Each design is inspired by a different location in<strong> Nigeria and some other cities in Africa </strong> showcasing the essence of our culture, customs &amp; cities through our PATTERNS!<br/>A great example is the below Lagos Model,  the multi-colors pattern on the solid black demonstrates the  peaceful coexistence of over 20 million vibrant and forward-looking people of diverse culture, race, tribe, religion and social status living together in harmony. </p>

<p><strong>Unique: </strong>A great example of Globalization,  a fusion of two cultures, the Spanish traditional espadrilles and Nigerian cultural textiles.  They are handcrafted and made with a lot of love and attention; therefore, each pair is unique, as you will not find two identical pairs. Moreover,each pair can be customized by the client's choice. </p>
<p><strong>Be Eco-friendly: </strong> Made with Natural elements. The manufacturing process of espadrilles takes place without the application of any chemicals, which is not detrimental to the environment. Soles made from recycled tires, this way you help in keeping our planet safe. They are responsible manufacturing.</p>
<p><strong>Extraordinary grip.</strong> The soles have an extraordinary resistance to wear and great grip on any type of surface and they are light weight.</p>
<p><strong>Comfortable, adaptable &amp; fresh</strong>: Fabric is 100% cotton and the insole is made of jute fiber. It's a natural product, therefore it breathes easily, and it allows your feet to be comfortable &amp; fresh and it prevents allergies. With stepping on the jute you are able to connect to the earth, in a magnetic way, which is part of our biology.</p>
<p><strong>Durable &amp; Trendy</strong>: In order to increase durability, the jute sole is finished in vulcanized recycled tires. Take them with you anywhere, it's <strong>enormous versatility,</strong> you get the possibility to combine with almost any type of look. </p>

</div></div>","Have you ever felt that you knew someone’s character by just looking at their shoes?
Footwear is a symbol of identity that reveals a vast part of our personalities. At Zulus Republic we do not just aim at producing a product that becomes simply a fashion trend, but rather a shoe  with a historical significance.
 

The birth of Zulus Republic all started with my love for shoes, creating my own designs with brilliant patterns and my passion about the African & Spanish culture and making our environment sustainable.
Born in Edo state, Nigeria where colors represent not just our clothes but culture, music,and simply everything that we are.

Each design is inspired by a different location in Nigeria and some other cities in Africa  showcasing the essence of our culture, customs & cities through our PATTERNS!A great example is the below Lagos Model,  the multi-colors pattern on the solid black demonstrates the  peaceful coexistence of over 20 million vibrant and forward-looking people of diverse culture, race, tribe, religion and social status living together in harmony. 
 
 
 


 
Unique: A great example of Globalization,  a fusion of two cultures, the Spanish traditional espadrilles and Nigerian cultural textiles.  They are handcrafted and made with a lot of love and attention; therefore, each pair is unique, as you will not find two identical pairs. Moreover,each pair can be customized by the client's choice. 
Be Eco-friendly:  Made with Natural elements. The manufacturing process of espadrilles takes place without the application of any chemicals, which is not detrimental to the environment. Soles made from recycled tires, this way you help in keeping our planet safe. They are responsible manufacturing.
Extraordinary grip. The soles have an extraordinary resistance to wear and great grip on any type of surface and they are light weight.
Comfortable, adaptable & fresh: Fabric is 100% cotton and the insole is made of jute fiber. It's a natural product, therefore it breathes easily, and it allows your feet to be comfortable & fresh and it prevents allergies. With stepping on the jute you are able to connect to the earth, in a magnetic way, which is part of our biology.
Durable & Trendy: In order to increase durability, the jute sole is finished in vulcanized recycled tires. Take them with you anywhere, it's enormous versatility, you get the possibility to combine with almost any type of look. 
 


You can customize your own design, by choosing from the below fabrics(I - XVI), e.g choosing to have just the sides, front or whole pair made of African fabric, while the other a plain color or as you desire.

 

 

 

All fabrics are limited, should in case we are out of your chosen fabric,you would be able to choose a different fabric or we would replace it for a very similar pattern.
 
MODELS:


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 

 
 

 

 

 
 

 

Hmmm! a basket  handbag what can be inside or held in it? A bag full of tricks!!!!Made of natural materialsHandmade by artisans in Northern Nigeria.
A must have  for the summer! 
 

Selection of raw materials is done meticulously to offer high quality footwear and a means to support local manufactures.
We use high quality African textiles, which are durable and 100% cotton like:

Adire, cloth from the Yoruba of SW Nigeria
Daviva, Indigo cloth from the Yoruba of SW Nigeria 
Kente,Woven appliqued cloth from the Asante and Ewe of Ghana 
Andinkra,Stamp printed cloth from the Asante of Ghana 

 


They are manually sewed and we use first grade quality materials, hereditary techniques and tools that have been transmitted from generation to generation using ""Punta de Ojal"", the Spanish traditional technic, with natural materials and this way the Espadrilles last for a very long time. 
 

 
Our concern & awareness of the environmental problems was the key of using rubber soles made from used TIRES, this way you can look COOL and do your bit for the environment at the same time :)

They are Eco-friendly,
 Sole made from recycled TIRES, this way you help in keeping our planet safe, 
 Tire soles are  resistant to water 
 They are light weight.

 

We recommend that you use your shoe size number. In case you are in between 2 sizes, or  not sure of the exact size, we advise that you chose your normal shoe size, because the Espadrilles will expand and adapt to your feet.
Choose your preferred design/color, after the campaign ends, we will send you an email with the sizing chart & color options.

Sean is an MBA student at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. This is his first venture where Sean gets to apply what he's learned from school to the real world. The top priority of our company is to have a thorough understanding of customers and in turn deliver a product that's original and adds value to supporters in our community. 
John works at GE Healthcare and is a seasoned veteran in operations, manufacturing, and project management. He is also Sean's stepdad. John taught Sean how to speak English when Sean came to the US as a little kid. Going down memory line, they used to read the Catcher in the Rye together line by line! Now it's time for the father and son to work on a project together!
You might've noticed, the main character from the video's name is also Naomi. That's because we named her after our lovely marketing director! Naomi is also Sean's better half. The two of them got married last summer. Guess what? Their honeymoon was spent visiting suppliers for PopTime! You can imagine the sacrifice Naomi made for her husband and for this project to work out :)


 
Risks and challenges
We have set our funding goal to be fixed. That means if we don't meet this goal amount by the end of the campaign, all backers will get a refund within 5-7 business days from Indiegogo. But if we are lucky enough to meet our goal, the raised capital will cover production costs and getting PopTime delivered to you :) We sincerely appreciate your support along the way and your time spent checking out this campaign. It's our wish that you can join us in bringing this product to life.",21.0,2,"1 Campaign

When we did some research , we found that almost no one was using recycled tires to make shoes. We aimed to change that. Then we discovered materials such as Hemp and Cactus Leather and started with the objective to make durable, stylish Vegan footwear, all using recycled tire rubber for our outsoles. We started work on the idea when the COVID 19 pandemic began in March 2020 and had formed a partnership with a family owned factory in Mexico that had experience of more than 25 years making footwear.</p><p>By November 2020, we had our first prototypes. After 4 iterations , in December 2020 , we had the perfect shoes and were ready to begin working on our Launch. Our Kickstarter video was ready in April 2021 and we formally launched in May 2020 and hope to count on your support in making our dream a reality and delivering awesome Vegan shoes you can be proud of by September 2021.</p><p> </p><h2>Risks and challenges</h2><p> </p><p>We have spent the last 18 months developing these shoes and our team has been working night and day to nail down and perfect the design, production, and logistics. We have worked closely with our manufacturers to ensure that quality control is met at every step of the production line. We are working with a factory that has more than 25 years experience in footwear manufacturing allowing us to have a well organized operation and ready to confront any situation that may arise. Our team has seen it all. We understand that no campaign comes without challenges. We promise to communicate with transparency and to work around the clock to ensure your expectations are met. The most common risk in manufacturing is production delays. And with COVID 19, the strain on Global supply chains has increased tenfold. However, 90% of our components are made in Mexico including the final shoes so we are relatively protected from potential global shortages.

The aforementioned reason is why we turned to crowdfunding to make our dream a reality.  Our Story: Hey everyone, we’re Faizan and Neha, husband and wife and the Founders of Malkry Footwear. We’re both originally from Karachi, Pakistan but have made Mississauga, Ontario, Canada as our full time home since August 2018.One of the reasons we made Canada our full time home is because of our love of Nature and the great outdoors. Both of us are obsessed with shoes and Faizan is a HUGE animal lover so we thought we would combine our two favorite passions into something awesome and that is how Malkry Footwear was born.Faizan holds a Masters Degree in Operations Management from Cardiff University , UK and Neha holds a Masters in Human Resources from Sheridan College, Mississauga, Canada. Both have extensive experience and complement each other with sound technical and operational knowledge and strong administrative skills which will help immensely in making our project a reality.The idea began in 2018 with using recycled tire rubber for making the shoe outsoles. When we did some research , we found that almost no one was using recycled tires to make shoes. We aimed to change that. Then we discovered materials such as Hemp and Cactus Leather and started with the objective to make durable, stylish Vegan footwear, all using recycled tire rubber for our outsoles. We started work on the idea when the COVID 19 pandemic began in March 2020 and had formed a partnership with a family owned factory in Mexico that had experience of more than 25 years making footwear.By November 2020, we had our first prototypes. After 4 iterations , in December 2020 , we had the perfect shoes and were ready to begin working on our Launch. Our Kickstarter video was ready in April 2021 and we formally launched in May 2020 and hope to count on your support in making our dream a reality and delivering awesome Vegan shoes you can be proud of by September 2021. Risks and challenges We have spent the last 18 months developing these shoes and our team has been working night and day to nail down and perfect the design, production, and logistics. We have worked closely with our manufacturers to ensure that quality control is met at every step of the production line. We are working with a factory that has more than 25 years experience in footwear manufacturing allowing us to have a well organized operation and ready to confront any situation that may arise. Our team has seen it all. We understand that no campaign comes without challenges. We promise to communicate with transparency and to work around the clock to ensure your expectations are met. The most common risk in manufacturing is production delays. And with COVID 19, the strain on Global supply chains has increased tenfold. However, 90% of our components are made in Mexico including the final shoes so we are relatively protected from potential global shortages. The manufacturing process relies on multiple components coming together at the same time. While we are very well versed in managing production and delivering on-time, there is always the possibility of a slight delay. However, we will be providing updates every step of the way to keep you fully informed.",44.0,0,"1 Campaign

The Edutape is taking the tape measures to the next level. The width of the tape will be wider than the normal tape used on tape measures and the length starts from 50cm upwards c/w locking function and slow tape return .This surface allows to print information and pictures on the tape and stored in a robust compacted body.
Some idea for the Edutape :

Education -  Kids information within there age groups such as pictures, numbers and alphabets will be flashed before there eyes several times a minuet as the enjoy the motion of opening the tape.

Baking and Cooking - Recipes and measurements .

Company business card - Give more company information and technical info.

Emergency - First aid and emergency information.
There are hundred other ideas but hope you get the picture. Hi I'm Dean, married to Sharon, we have a daughter Danya and two boys Jon and James. My technical background and creative mind keeps me awake many nights with ideas constantly bouncing around my head.
Often when busy in my workshop, my boys were always digging around in my tools and I noticed they were obsessed with my tape measures. They played with them non stop, they carried them around the house and I could never find them. Then one day the idea hit me, this could be used as great learning tool for children.
It's been a dream for several years to manufacture the Edutape and see kids from all different tribes and tongues enjoying fun learning. Quality and safety are top of priority. It is compacted, robust and can just about go anywhere. 

I am looking for US$ 100000.00 to get the Edutape into the commercial market. The spending breakdown is as follows;


$20 000 for six month overheads 
$ 5 000 for graphic design and mould design.
$10 000 for travel and hotels to manufactures.
$30 000 for moulds manufacture and raw materials.
$10 000 for marketing
$10 000 packaging shipping and handling.
$ 5 000 I have a provisional patent and would like to strengthen my protection. 
$10 000 for unexpected costs.

Perks of investing in Edutape?  A once off special limited design set that will be produced specially for investors during the selected time frame. The collectors set will have my personal signature. Once the limit is reached the mould will never be used again. My belief is that this will increase the value as it will be a collectors item/limited edition.

If we don't reach your entire goal we have opted to raise funds after the deadline until we can for-full our contributors investments and see our dream realised. The deadline may have to be extended .    We have books, flash cards and electronic learning products and believe there a massive market for Edutape. It is a simple and fun educational toy. The basic units don't need a power source and they are robust and compact.

We have many ideas for the Edutape beyond children's toys, for example; train time tables, emergency information, distances and direction and many more. 
It is a totally new concept and easy to copy, therefore we want to hit the industry by storm .



In solving these challenges we would look at getting stronger patent protection, work with cutting edge manufacturers and getting distribution contracts signed internationally. We have the services of graphic design company and accountant on board ready to assist.     Any contributions large or small will be a major blessing. Please help us spead the word about Edutape so that we can make this great concept a reality.

<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: How long is the battery life?</strong></p>
<p>Battery life per shoe is up to 3 hours. For a total of 6 hours play time if you play 1 shoe at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Are the BoomS waterproof?</strong></p>
<p>The BoomS will be water resistant. Some sweat and light rain shouldn't do it any harm. Like most electronics, take it easy around water.</p>

At the Skate Park

Who we are
We are sneaker lovers, music lovers, fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters. All working towards one goal, and that's bringing BoomS to life. With the help of friends and family. Input, suggestions and other wacky ideas. We came up with something that's worth talking about. Or something you can just listen to because BoomS sound great.
Who are we working with
We are working with an enthusiastic group of people. It's a great feeling to work with companies that actually believe in you and what you're trying to accomplish.  With the latest in shoe factory equipment, they offer great reliability and suggestions on meeting our quality goals and deadlines. With your help, we could make this all possible.

What can you do with BoomS
Get out there and play. Go with the music. In the 80s they carried boom boxes. Now we got BooMs. You can play soccer, basketball, football, tennis, baseball, and volleyball. Or you can go skating, running, do some yoga, dance or just walk.

Your Impact
Your funding goes toward finalizing designs, creating a production mold, and setting up a production line to create BoomS. Your help will also give us the push we need to get out there in front of the world. 
Song Selection
Due to copyright issues, we could not play many songs in the video. We are working on this. We look forward to playing different songs in update video clips. 
 
Risks & Challenges
Timing is everything, with any production item, you will always have ups and downs. Small or big, they're all time consuming. I know this very well because I have worked in the production business for over 10 years now. 
The best solution is communication, keeping you informed, and up to date. Nobody likes waiting for that package in the mail. We like to know when the product is on the way. To make things easier. We will do just that. Keep you informed, one update at a time until you have the product at your door.
Not only do we want to get it right, we want to make sure it's a product built with quality and stability.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
Tell a friend, tell a family member, tell a stranger. Okay, okay, don't talk to strangers.  Just make sure you tell somebody about us. The more people we reach. The higher our odds will be of having a successful campaign. 
Thanks in advance for you support.

FAQ
Q: How long is the battery life?
Battery life per shoe is up to 3 hours. For a total of 6 hours play time if you play 1 shoe at a time.
Q: Are the BoomS waterproof?
The BoomS will be water resistant. Some sweat and light rain shouldn't do it any harm. Like most electronics, take it easy around water.

<p> </p>
<p>Wir sind <a href=""http://bojkuwemhoff.de/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BojkuWemhoff</a> - drei Freunde aus dem Münsterland, die Euch dabei helfen wollen, gut auszusehen. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504354350/ihli8frw3veaywcx6n9w.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Wir sind ein BWL Student, ein Architektur Student und ein Immobilienkaufmann und zusammen sind wir BojkuWemhoff - oder eben kurz: <strong>BW Watches</strong>.</p>
<p>Während eines gemeinsamen Shoppingausflugs haben wir gemerkt, dass alle Uhren die uns gefallen haben, entweder unser Budget sprengen oder von jedem Zweiten am Handgelenk getragen werden und somit keine Individualität ausstrahlen. Mit unserem Projekt wollen wir genau das ändern! </p>
<p>Daher haben wir uns zusammengesetzt und sechs verschiedene Uhren mit eigenen Persönlichkeiten designed und uns Gedanken gemacht, wie wir Euch ein besonderes Erlebnis und eine schöne Zeit mit Eurem neuen Begleiter am Handgelenk bieten können - das Folgende hat sich daraus ergeben:</p>
<h3>Die Uhr</h3>
<p>Schaut Euch <a href=""https://1drv.ms/b/s!Aisb9UUBly2MjmmVlJJx506RqGDh"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hier</a> unser LookBook für die 1. Collection an.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Unsere Uhren fallen auf - sie sind anders.</h3>
<p><br/>Sechs Uhren, die den Geschmack aller Leute treffen sollen. Von eleganten und klassischen Uhren, wie der ""Samuel"", bis hin zu komplett goldenen, wie der ""Leonardo"".</p>

<h3>Samuel</h3>
<p>Der Anzug sitzt? Die Schuhe poliert? Die Krawatte gerichtet? Jetzt fehlt nur noch die richtige Uhr. Was ein Zufall, dass wir genau die Richtige haben! Mit der ""Samuel"" reicht es vielleicht nicht für den ""Man of the Year"" aber ""Man of the Office"" bist Du garantiert. Und nach der Arbeit gehst Du mit der süßen Blondine noch etwas essen und am Ende des Abends gehst Du sicher nicht allein nach Hause.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504354469/grccpa0ikjb4f3plc2hc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Channing</h3>
<p>Die ""Channing"" besticht durch ihr dezentes Auftreten. Egal wo Du bist - bei der Party, wo Du die hübsche Blondine oder den süßen Typen aus der BiB triffst, im Büro, wo Du durch Leistung überzeugst oder einfach wenn Du mit deinen Freunden unterwegs bist: Mit der ""Channing"" bist Du immer bestens gerüstet, alles erreichen zu können!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504354491/bcrp3q5vtxrjolbnzkgg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Roségoldene Farben und ein zeitloses klassisches Design werden Dir auch an regnerischen Tagen ein Lächeln auf die Lippen zaubern. Also: Schnapp Dir Deine Freunde, Lippenstift drauf und mach den Tag zu Deinem Tag oder die Nacht oder Beides, das bleibt Dir überlassen! You rule the world, girl!</p>

<h3>Neal</h3>
<p>Dein Outfit sitzt zu jeder Tageszeit perfekt? Deine Schuhe sind immer top gepflegt und Du bestichst durch ein tolles Auftreten? Dann solltest Du Dir ""Neal"" näher anschauen. Klassisches Design und dezente Farben helfen Dir, jedem Deiner Outfits den letzten Schliff zu geben.

<h3>Rachel</h3>
<p>Sommerkleid, Eis, Sonnenbrille, Sonne und Deine besten Freunde - was fehlt da noch? Richtig, der letzte Schliff. Das kleine Etwas. Und zufälligerweise haben wir da etwas für Dich. Die ""Rachel"" komplettiert jedes Outfit und schmeichelt Dir mit ihren sanften, femininen Farben. Worauf wartest Du noch, Süße? Dieser Sommer ist Dein Sommer!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504354546/a5nbehgc081eqcqu7ldz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Leonardo</h3>
<p>Understatement ist nicht so Dein Ding? Dann bist Du hier genau richtig.  Golden wie der Oscar, aber leichter zu kriegen. Die ""Leonardo"" fällt einfach auf, egal wo Du Dich bewegst. Von den roten Teppichen vor den Clubs Deiner Stadt oder kombiniert mit einem schlichten Shirt - mit dieser Uhr gehst Du nicht unter. </p>
<p>Alle unsere Uhren teilen jedoch einiges:</p>
<h3>1. Die hohe Qualität.</h3>
<p>Alle unsere Uhren haben ein mechanisches Präzisions-uhrwerk, eine Scheibe aus Saphir Glas und sie sind wasserdicht. Wir sind so überzeugt, dass wir Eure Uhren mit einer Garantie liefern. Sollte innerhalb des ersten Jahres das Uhrwerk einen Schaden nehmen, dann bekommt Ihr eine neue Uhr als Ersatz. Ohne Wenn und Aber.</p>
<h3>2. Der Preis</h3>
<p>Alle unsere Uhren werden zu dem gleichen Preis angeboten. Du musst Dich also nicht bei jeder Uhr fragen, ob sie in Deinem Budget liegt. Liegt eine Uhr in Deinem Budget, hast Du die freie Wahl bei der gesamten Kollektion.</p>
<h3>3. Der Versand</h3>
<p>""Der Versand sollte schnell und kostenlos sein"" - Jesus.</p>
<p>Diesem Wunsch sind wir nachgegangen. Ihr zahlt keinen Cent für den Versand - egal wo Ihr auf der Welt seid. Von Amsterdam bis nach Zypern, Eure neue Uhr kommt schnell und gratis zu Euch.</p>
<h3>4. Das Soziale Engagement</h3>
<p>Wir wollen die Chance nutzen und den Leuten etwas geben, die es schwerer im Leben haben als Du und ich, also schaffen wir Arbeitsplätze für wundervolle geistig und körperlich beeinträchtigte Menschen.<br/>Unsere Versandpakete werden von sozialen Einrichtungen verpackt und versandt und so können wir Menschen helfen, einen Job zu finden und eine hoffentlich langjährige Beziehung mit uns und unseren Kunden einzugehen. Uns geht es nicht nur um die Zahlen, uns geht es um die Menschen, die wir mit unserer Uhr begeistern und glücklich machen können.</p>
<h3>5. Die einzigartige Verpackung</h3>
<p>Unsere Uhr kommt in einer massiven, wunderschönen Holzbox, die einmalig in diesem Preissegment ist. Diese schützt die Uhr nicht nur, sondern sieht auch später in deiner Wohnung unglaublich gut aus. Velours-Untergrund und Leder inklusive.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504525777/yi9maxlteexwqunkikwm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>6. Personalisiertes Shopping-Erlebnis</h3>
<p>Für uns sind unsere Kunden mehr als nur ein Name im System. Für uns seid Ihr ein Teil der BW Family. Daher liegen jedem Paket ein persönliches Geschenk und ein Anschreiben sowie weitere Extras bei. Generische Anschreiben sind unpersönlich und bedeuten nichts, also haben wir das geändert.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Was Du uns gibst &amp; was Du bekommst</h3>
<p>Hier ist es ein einfaches ""Geben und Nehmen"".</p>
<p>Du bekommst eine tolle Uhr, persönliche Accessoires, eine exklusive Uhrenbox und kostenlosen Versand. Du bist komplett auf der sicheren Seite - wir haben bereits Prototypen der Uhren und haben sie auf Herz und Nieren getestet - und wir sind sehr zufrieden! Zusätzlich haben wir uns verschiedene Meinungen eingeholt und Juweliere gefragt, was diese von unseren Uhren halten. Die Rückmeldungen waren allesamt positiv.</p>
<p>Du investierst in ein nachhaltiges Unternehmen, das sich um seine Mitarbeiter und Mitmenschen kümmert. Du hilfst uns und vielen anderen Menschen und bekommst eine tolle Uhr, es ist also eine Win-Win-Situation. </p>
<p>Für den späteren Verkauf peilen wir einen Verkaufspreis von 140 € an, hier habt Ihr die Möglichkeit, Euch eine Uhr für 90 € zu sichern - inklusive Versand und gutem Gewissen.<br/> <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p>

<h3>Was passierte und was noch kommt</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504156138/l6siypapxo9a9jb2l3xp.png"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p>
<p><br/>Im Dezember 2016 wurde die Idee ins Leben gerufen. Es folgten ein paar Monate, in denen wir die Uhren designed und einen Hersteller gesucht haben. Nach Verhandlungen mit dem Hersteller haben wir unsere Prototypen bestellt. Auf Grund des chinesischen Neujahrs verspätete sich die Lieferung jedoch. Wir sind froh, dass wir solche Schwierigkeiten erlebt haben, bevor wir live gegangen sind, damit Ihr solche Probleme nicht erlebt. Nachdem die Prototypen bestellt wurden, haben wir uns um das ganze Paket gekümmert. Welche Boxen möchten wir nehmen? Welche Zugaben gibt es? Wie machen wir das ganze Shopping-Erlebnis persönlich und ansprechend? Das waren einige Herausforderungen, denen wir uns stellten. Anschließend ging es darum, eine soziale Einrichtung zu finden, die wir unterstützen können und die uns auch helfen kann, den Versand zu bewerkstelligen. <br/>Nachdem wir unsere Prototyp Uhren erhalten haben, haben wir angefangen, Fotos und Videos zu machen, damit wir unsere sozialen Kanäle und die Website mit Content füllen können.<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> Anschliessend haben wir Blogs geschrieben, Websites erstellt und diese Kampagne geschrieben. Zusätzlich haben wir mit verschiedenen Einzelhändlern gesprochen, um auch physisch in einigen Läden vertreten zu sein.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Sollten wir unser Ziel nicht erreichen können, bekommt Ihr Euer Geld natürlich direkt zurück.</span><br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risiken &amp; Herausforderungen</h3> <p>In den vergangenen 10 Monaten haben wir definitiv viel gelernt. Wir haben viel über die Schwierigkeiten des Gründens gelernt. Wir haben gelernt, wieviel Bürokratie es ist, wieviel Zeit und Aufwand man investieren muss, doch trotz all der Rückschläge sind wir unglaublich froh, dass wir jetzt da stehen, wo wir sind. Wir haben ein fertiges Produkt, einen funktionierenden Prototyp!</p>
<p>Wir sind zudem eine eingetragene Unternehmung, haben alle Social Media Kanäle erstellt und eine Website designed - und da sind wir mächtig stolz drauf. Wir sind als Team zusammengewachsen, haben viel über uns gelernt und gemerkt, dass wir ein junges &amp; dynamisches Team sind, das viel bewegen kann. Wir sind bereit für etwas Grosses und Anderes, etwas, dass einzigartig und authentisch ist.</p>
<p>Natürlich kann es sein, dass Euch unsere Uhren nicht gefallen oder Ihr nicht warten wollt, vielleicht erreichen wir auch unser Funding Ziel nicht, doch das sind Faktoren, die wir nur bedingt beeinflussen können. Wir haben unser Bestes gegeben, Uhren zu designen und zu produzieren, die Euren Geschmack treffen - jetzt liegt es an Euch!</p> <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span><br/> </div><div>
<h3>Andere Wege, wie man helfen kann</h3> <p>Euch gefällt unsere Idee, aber momentan seid Ihr einfach knapp bei Kasse oder Ihr braucht gerade keine neue Uhr?</p>
<p>Dann folgt uns auf Facebook oder Instagram - jedes Like und jeder Click bringt uns ein Stück näher an unser Ziel. </p>
<p>Vielleicht kennst Du ja auch jemanden, der eine neue Uhr möchte, dann erzähl ihm doch von uns!</p>

<p><br/>We are <a href=""http://bojkuwemhoff.de/en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BojkuWemhoff</a> - 3 friends from a small town in Germany and we want to help you look stunning.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504354569/cy3jxmzbwk93e2vnfaoj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We are one business student, one architecture student and one real estate business man and together, we are BojkuWemhoff - or shorter: <strong>BW Watches</strong>.</p>
<p>During a collective shopping trip, we experienced a big problem. Every watch we liked would either kill our budget or it would be worn by every second person we see - and that was really frustrating because we wanted to express our individuality, our personal style and that is why we started this project. We want to change that.</p>
<p>So we got together and created 6 different watches with individul looks and personalities. We were thinking: How can we give You a special shopping experience and a new companion for Your wrist, without making You sell a kidney. That´s what we came up with:</p>
<h3>The Watch</h3>
<p>Take a look at our first collection on our <a href=""https://1drv.ms/b/s!Aisb9UUBly2MjmmVlJJx506RqGDh"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lookbook here.</a></p>

<h3>Our watches are different - They will catch everyone´s attention.</h3>
<p>6 watches that are made to meet everyone´s taste. From elegant and classy like ""Samuel"" to complete golden and striking - like our ""Leonardo"".</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504354618/biq329qgk2hstgh6tczh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Samuel</h3>
<p>Your suit fits perfectly? Your tie is on point? Now You are only missing the right watch.</p>
<p>What a coincidence that we offer Your new partner in crime. Maybe You will not be ""Man of the Year"" right away, but You will definitely become ""Man of the Office"". And at the end of the day, You will take the cute blonde coworker of Yours out for dinner. You will definitely not go home alone. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504354646/iidmz4iabsmwhpqusjhj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Channing</h3>
<p>""Channing"" comes with an unbeatable elegance.</p>
<p>No matter where You are, You will always look stunning. Whether You are partying and flirting with that blonde girl or that cute boy You like, or in the office, where this watch perfects Your outfit. ""Channing"" will help You to reach Your goals!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504354666/sgx4egiuomkgaojy1mud.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Donna</h3>
<p>You are just stunning and never let anything slip? Then we have something just for You. Rose golden colours and a timeless design will make You smile even on the rainiest of days. So: Get together with Your friends, put some lipstick on and make this day Yours. You rule the world, girl!</p>

<h3>Neal</h3>
<p>Your outfit is always on fleek? Your shoes are perfectly clean and whenever You enter a room, all eyes are on You? Then take a closer look at ""Neal"".  Classic design and clear colours will make Your outfit perfect.  What are You waiting for - ""Neal"" is always ready, just like You!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504354739/rtwypaizpeenxkrvnb3s.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Rachel</h3>
<p>Summer dress, ice cream, sunglasses and Your girls - but something is still missing: The last step to perfection. And what a coincidence that we have something for You! Our ""Rachel"" completes every outfit and adds elegance and joy with her warm, feminine colours. What are you waiting for, Cutie? This summer is Your summer.</p>

<h3>Leonardo</h3>
<p>You don´t really like understatement? Then do not look further. Golden like the Oscar, but easier to get. Our ""Leonardo"" will always shine - on the red carpets in front of the clubs in Your city or if You combine it with a plain black T.</p>
<p>But since our watches are one big family, they also share a few aspects:</p>
<h3>1. The high quality</h3>
<p>All our watches come with a precision movement, saphire glas and they are waterproof. We are so convinced by the quality of our watches that we offer You a 1 year ""No Questions Asked"" guarantee. If Your watch happens to have a problem within that period, we will replace it.</p>
<h3>2. The price</h3>
<p>All our watches are offered for the same price. You do not have to check Your budget for every watch. Do it once and You have the free choice.</p>
<h3>3. Delivery</h3>
<p>""Delivery should be fast and free"" - Jesus.</p>
<p>OK Jesus, we heard you. You do not pay any cent extra for fast and worldwide delivery. From Amsterdam to Zimbabwe - Your watch is delivered for free.</p>
<h3>4. Social engagement</h3>
<p>We wanted to use the chance and give back to the people that have a harder life than You and I - So we found a way to create workplaces for handicapped people. Our packages will be assembled and shipped by a social institution in our hometown that employs handicapped people with whom we hope to establish a long-term relationship. For us it is not only about the numbers - it is about making people happy.</p>
<h3>5. The unique packaging</h3>
<p>All our watches come in a massive wooden box that is unique in this price segment. It protects the watch during travelling and will definitely earn a top spot in Your room because it just looks incredible.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504525805/cpygr6su7dftazrzyrfj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>6. Personalized shopping experience</h3>
<p>For us, our customers are more than just a number in the system. You are a part of the BW family. That´s why every box comes with a personalized gift, a letter, directly addressed to You and other extras. Generic was yesterday - we care about You.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What You give and what You get</h3>
<p>This is easy - give and be rewarded with Your new best friend.</p>
<p>You receive a great watch, personalized accessories, a great box and free delivery. <br/>And You are on the safe side - we do already have the watches as prototypes at home and wear, test and love them every day. We went out and got many feedbacks on our watches and they were very positive.</p>
<p>You are also investing in a sustainable company that cares for its people. You are helping many people and receive a watch for a great price. It is a win-win situation.</p>
<p>The retail price will be around 140€- You have the chance to save Yourself a watch for 90€ only - including free delivery and the feeling of having helped many people.<br/> <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How it all started</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504156171/onjmjihseydknqh8p98q.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>It all started in December 2016, followed by a few tough months of research and Skype calls until we finally found a producer for our watches and we ordered our prototypes. Due to the Chinese New Year, our delivery was delayed heavily, but we are happy to have made this experience, so You do not have to experience it Yourself. After we had ordered the samples, we took care of the whole package - which extras we will put in the package? Which box will we use? How can we make buying our watch a personalized shopping experience? We tackled those challenges and overcame them all. Now it was time to find a social institution that will help us do good and that will take care of the distribution.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">After having received our prototype, we started to take pictures and created videos, so that we can fill our social media channels and websites with content now. Then we wrote blogs, finished our website and wrote the campaign. In addition, we talked to retailers to make the watch also available in physical stores.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Should we not meet our target, of course, You will be refunded your money,</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We have definitely learned a lot in the last 10 months! We learned, what it means to found a company - with all its ups and downs, wins and losses. But now we have the final product and we are very proud and extremely happy with the result.</p>
<p>We are a registered business, filled all our social media channels and designed a website to deliver You the full coverage of what we do and to engage with our customers. We grew as a team and we figured out that we can make an impact! We are ready for something big, something fresh and authentic.</p>Of course it could happen that You do not like our watches or that You do not want to wait. Maybe we will not reach our funding goal, but we cannot influence those factors. We did everything we could to design and produce watches that will be great for everyone - now it is up to You.<br/> </div>
<div>
<h3>Other ways to help</h3>
<p>You like our idea, but Your wallet disagrees with You? Maybe You just do not need a watch at the moment. Then follow us on Facebook and Instagram - every like and every click helps us to reach our ambitious goal.</p>
<p>If You know someone that needs a watch, spread the word!</p>

Alle unsere Uhren teilen jedoch einiges:
1. Die hohe Qualität.
Alle unsere Uhren haben ein mechanisches Präzisions-uhrwerk, eine Scheibe aus Saphir Glas und sie sind wasserdicht. Wir sind so überzeugt, dass wir Eure Uhren mit einer Garantie liefern. Sollte innerhalb des ersten Jahres das Uhrwerk einen Schaden nehmen, dann bekommt Ihr eine neue Uhr als Ersatz. Ohne Wenn und Aber.
2. Der Preis
Alle unsere Uhren werden zu dem gleichen Preis angeboten. Du musst Dich also nicht bei jeder Uhr fragen, ob sie in Deinem Budget liegt. Liegt eine Uhr in Deinem Budget, hast Du die freie Wahl bei der gesamten Kollektion.
3. Der Versand
""Der Versand sollte schnell und kostenlos sein"" - Jesus.
Diesem Wunsch sind wir nachgegangen. Ihr zahlt keinen Cent für den Versand - egal wo Ihr auf der Welt seid. Von Amsterdam bis nach Zypern, Eure neue Uhr kommt schnell und gratis zu Euch.
4. Das Soziale Engagement
Wir wollen die Chance nutzen und den Leuten etwas geben, die es schwerer im Leben haben als Du und ich, also schaffen wir Arbeitsplätze für wundervolle geistig und körperlich beeinträchtigte Menschen.Unsere Versandpakete werden von sozialen Einrichtungen verpackt und versandt und so können wir Menschen helfen, einen Job zu finden und eine hoffentlich langjährige Beziehung mit uns und unseren Kunden einzugehen. Uns geht es nicht nur um die Zahlen, uns geht es um die Menschen, die wir mit unserer Uhr begeistern und glücklich machen können.
5. Die einzigartige Verpackung
Unsere Uhr kommt in einer massiven, wunderschönen Holzbox, die einmalig in diesem Preissegment ist. Diese schützt die Uhr nicht nur, sondern sieht auch später in deiner Wohnung unglaublich gut aus. Velours-Untergrund und Leder inklusive.

6. Personalisiertes Shopping-Erlebnis
Für uns sind unsere Kunden mehr als nur ein Name im System. Für uns seid Ihr ein Teil der BW Family. Daher liegen jedem Paket ein persönliches Geschenk und ein Anschreiben sowie weitere Extras bei. Generische Anschreiben sind unpersönlich und bedeuten nichts, also haben wir das geändert.

Was Du uns gibst & was Du bekommst
Hier ist es ein einfaches ""Geben und Nehmen"".
Du bekommst eine tolle Uhr, persönliche Accessoires, eine exklusive Uhrenbox und kostenlosen Versand. Du bist komplett auf der sicheren Seite - wir haben bereits Prototypen der Uhren und haben sie auf Herz und Nieren getestet - und wir sind sehr zufrieden! Zusätzlich haben wir uns verschiedene Meinungen eingeholt und Juweliere gefragt, was diese von unseren Uhren halten. Die Rückmeldungen waren allesamt positiv.
Du investierst in ein nachhaltiges Unternehmen, das sich um seine Mitarbeiter und Mitmenschen kümmert. Du hilfst uns und vielen anderen Menschen und bekommst eine tolle Uhr, es ist also eine Win-Win-Situation. 
Für den späteren Verkauf peilen wir einen Verkaufspreis von 140 € an, hier habt Ihr die Möglichkeit, Euch eine Uhr für 90 € zu sichern - inklusive Versand und gutem Gewissen.  

Was passierte und was noch kommt
 

Im Dezember 2016 wurde die Idee ins Leben gerufen. Es folgten ein paar Monate, in denen wir die Uhren designed und einen Hersteller gesucht haben. Nach Verhandlungen mit dem Hersteller haben wir unsere Prototypen bestellt. Auf Grund des chinesischen Neujahrs verspätete sich die Lieferung jedoch. Wir sind froh, dass wir solche Schwierigkeiten erlebt haben, bevor wir live gegangen sind, damit Ihr solche Probleme nicht erlebt. Nachdem die Prototypen bestellt wurden, haben wir uns um das ganze Paket gekümmert. Welche Boxen möchten wir nehmen? Welche Zugaben gibt es? Wie machen wir das ganze Shopping-Erlebnis persönlich und ansprechend? Das waren einige Herausforderungen, denen wir uns stellten. Anschließend ging es darum, eine soziale Einrichtung zu finden, die wir unterstützen können und die uns auch helfen kann, den Versand zu bewerkstelligen. Nachdem wir unsere Prototyp Uhren erhalten haben, haben wir angefangen, Fotos und Videos zu machen, damit wir unsere sozialen Kanäle und die Website mit Content füllen können. Anschliessend haben wir Blogs geschrieben, Websites erstellt und diese Kampagne geschrieben. Zusätzlich haben wir mit verschiedenen Einzelhändlern gesprochen, um auch physisch in einigen Läden vertreten zu sein.
Sollten wir unser Ziel nicht erreichen können, bekommt Ihr Euer Geld natürlich direkt zurück. 

Risiken & Herausforderungen In den vergangenen 10 Monaten haben wir definitiv viel gelernt. Wir haben viel über die Schwierigkeiten des Gründens gelernt. Wir haben gelernt, wieviel Bürokratie es ist, wieviel Zeit und Aufwand man investieren muss, doch trotz all der Rückschläge sind wir unglaublich froh, dass wir jetzt da stehen, wo wir sind. Wir haben ein fertiges Produkt, einen funktionierenden Prototyp!
Wir sind zudem eine eingetragene Unternehmung, haben alle Social Media Kanäle erstellt und eine Website designed - und da sind wir mächtig stolz drauf. Wir sind als Team zusammengewachsen, haben viel über uns gelernt und gemerkt, dass wir ein junges & dynamisches Team sind, das viel bewegen kann. Wir sind bereit für etwas Grosses und Anderes, etwas, dass einzigartig und authentisch ist.
Natürlich kann es sein, dass Euch unsere Uhren nicht gefallen oder Ihr nicht warten wollt, vielleicht erreichen wir auch unser Funding Ziel nicht, doch das sind Faktoren, die wir nur bedingt beeinflussen können. Wir haben unser Bestes gegeben, Uhren zu designen und zu produzieren, die Euren Geschmack treffen - jetzt liegt es an Euch!   
Andere Wege, wie man helfen kann Euch gefällt unsere Idee, aber momentan seid Ihr einfach knapp bei Kasse oder Ihr braucht gerade keine neue Uhr?
Dann folgt uns auf Facebook oder Instagram - jedes Like und jeder Click bringt uns ein Stück näher an unser Ziel. 
Vielleicht kennst Du ja auch jemanden, der eine neue Uhr möchte, dann erzähl ihm doch von uns!

Website: http://bojkuwemhoff.de/en Who we are and why we are here. Let's keep it short.
We are BojkuWemhoff - 3 friends from a small town in Germany and we want to help you look stunning.

We are one business student, one architecture student and one real estate business man and together, we are BojkuWemhoff - or shorter: BW Watches.
During a collective shopping trip, we experienced a big problem. Every watch we liked would either kill our budget or it would be worn by every second person we see - and that was really frustrating because we wanted to express our individuality, our personal style and that is why we started this project. We want to change that.
So we got together and created 6 different watches with individul looks and personalities. We were thinking: How can we give You a special shopping experience and a new companion for Your wrist, without making You sell a kidney. That´s what we came up with:
The Watch
Take a look at our first collection on our Lookbook here.

Our watches are different - They will catch everyone´s attention.
6 watches that are made to meet everyone´s taste. From elegant and classy like ""Samuel"" to complete golden and striking - like our ""Leonardo"".
 

Samuel
Your suit fits perfectly? Your tie is on point? Now You are only missing the right watch.
What a coincidence that we offer Your new partner in crime. Maybe You will not be ""Man of the Year"" right away, but You will definitely become ""Man of the Office"". And at the end of the day, You will take the cute blonde coworker of Yours out for dinner. You will definitely not go home alone. 

Channing
""Channing"" comes with an unbeatable elegance.
No matter where You are, You will always look stunning. Whether You are partying and flirting with that blonde girl or that cute boy You like, or in the office, where this watch perfects Your outfit. ""Channing"" will help You to reach Your goals!

Donna
You are just stunning and never let anything slip? Then we have something just for You. Rose golden colours and a timeless design will make You smile even on the rainiest of days. So: Get together with Your friends, put some lipstick on and make this day Yours. You rule the world, girl!

Neal
Your outfit is always on fleek? Your shoes are perfectly clean and whenever You enter a room, all eyes are on You? Then take a closer look at ""Neal"".  Classic design and clear colours will make Your outfit perfect.  What are You waiting for - ""Neal"" is always ready, just like You!

Rachel
Summer dress, ice cream, sunglasses and Your girls - but something is still missing: The last step to perfection. And what a coincidence that we have something for You! Our ""Rachel"" completes every outfit and adds elegance and joy with her warm, feminine colours. What are you waiting for, Cutie? This summer is Your summer.

Leonardo
You don´t really like understatement? Then do not look further. Golden like the Oscar, but easier to get. Our ""Leonardo"" will always shine - on the red carpets in front of the clubs in Your city or if You combine it with a plain black T.
But since our watches are one big family, they also share a few aspects:
1. The high quality
All our watches come with a precision movement, saphire glas and they are waterproof. We are so convinced by the quality of our watches that we offer You a 1 year ""No Questions Asked"" guarantee. If Your watch happens to have a problem within that period, we will replace it.
2. The price
All our watches are offered for the same price. You do not have to check Your budget for every watch. Do it once and You have the free choice.
3. Delivery
""Delivery should be fast and free"" - Jesus.
OK Jesus, we heard you. You do not pay any cent extra for fast and worldwide delivery. From Amsterdam to Zimbabwe - Your watch is delivered for free.
4. Social engagement
We wanted to use the chance and give back to the people that have a harder life than You and I - So we found a way to create workplaces for handicapped people. Our packages will be assembled and shipped by a social institution in our hometown that employs handicapped people with whom we hope to establish a long-term relationship. For us it is not only about the numbers - it is about making people happy.
5. The unique packaging
All our watches come in a massive wooden box that is unique in this price segment. It protects the watch during travelling and will definitely earn a top spot in Your room because it just looks incredible.

6. Personalized shopping experience
For us, our customers are more than just a number in the system. You are a part of the BW family. That´s why every box comes with a personalized gift, a letter, directly addressed to You and other extras. Generic was yesterday - we care about You.


What You give and what You get
This is easy - give and be rewarded with Your new best friend.
You receive a great watch, personalized accessories, a great box and free delivery. And You are on the safe side - we do already have the watches as prototypes at home and wear, test and love them every day. We went out and got many feedbacks on our watches and they were very positive.
You are also investing in a sustainable company that cares for its people. You are helping many people and receive a watch for a great price. It is a win-win situation.
The retail price will be around 140€- You have the chance to save Yourself a watch for 90€ only - including free delivery and the feeling of having helped many people.  


How it all started

It all started in December 2016, followed by a few tough months of research and Skype calls until we finally found a producer for our watches and we ordered our prototypes. Due to the Chinese New Year, our delivery was delayed heavily, but we are happy to have made this experience, so You do not have to experience it Yourself. After we had ordered the samples, we took care of the whole package - which extras we will put in the package? Which box will we use? How can we make buying our watch a personalized shopping experience? We tackled those challenges and overcame them all. Now it was time to find a social institution that will help us do good and that will take care of the distribution.
After having received our prototype, we started to take pictures and created videos, so that we can fill our social media channels and websites with content now. Then we wrote blogs, finished our website and wrote the campaign. In addition, we talked to retailers to make the watch also available in physical stores.
Should we not meet our target, of course, You will be refunded your money,


Risks and challenges
 
We have definitely learned a lot in the last 10 months! We learned, what it means to found a company - with all its ups and downs, wins and losses. But now we have the final product and we are very proud and extremely happy with the result.
We are a registered business, filled all our social media channels and designed a website to deliver You the full coverage of what we do and to engage with our customers. We grew as a team and we figured out that we can make an impact! We are ready for something big, something fresh and authentic.Of course it could happen that You do not like our watches or that You do not want to wait. Maybe we will not reach our funding goal, but we cannot influence those factors. We did everything we could to design and produce watches that will be great for everyone - now it is up to You. 

Other ways to help
You like our idea, but Your wallet disagrees with You? Maybe You just do not need a watch at the moment. Then follow us on Facebook and Instagram - every like and every click helps us to reach our ambitious goal.
If You know someone that needs a watch, spread the word!

Meet RECO Mask, a wearable air purifier that can provide you high-quality air filtration and a free-breathing experience.

 
RECO Mask’s built-in active airflow module effectively guides your exhaling out of the mask, which allows for high breathability in different occasions. Combined with a replaceable N95 grade filter and a sleek, ergonomic outer skin, RECO Mask can provide you up to months of comfortable protection. 

 

 
We believe that you deserve to breathe better.
In this post quarantine world, masks have become a necessity for people to do just about anything in public from shopping, dining, to socializing. However, the experience of wearing masks has not been so pleasant.
 
 If you are reading this, chances are that you have felt the stuffiness and moisture when wearing a mask. You have smelled your own bad breath behind the mask, which makes you wonder if others have noticed when you are not wearing one. Your glasses are always foggy no matter how many times you adjust the mask. Why do people have to choose between safety and breathe freely? What is wrong with your current mask? Nothing. Most face masks can effectively filter particles in the air for you, because a mask is essentially multiple layers of fabrics that capture various sizes of particles before they enter your nose or mouth. However, when you exhale, the fabrics block the air from leaving the mask, which creates a high-pressure zone on your face. Without a “proper” way to vent out, this trapped exhaling causes you to feel the stuffiness and moisture. “The New Normal”RECO Mask was created by a team of like-minded fresh graduates from Boston University, Emerson College, University of Pennsylvania, and many renowned universities. We experienced the discomfort from wearing face masks, and we were inspired to develop a breathable, reusable, and stylish mask that can be incorporated into people's daily lifestyle. As the world reopens, a new normal of human mobility will emerge, and we believe that it is time to introduce “the new normal” of face masks.       Air Module Test Footage RECO is more than a regular mask. It is a wearable air purifier that will change the way you perceive face masks. The moment you press the power button and activate the air module, it will vent out all the hot air and moisture accumulated in the mask, leaving you a refreshing feeling.   One Filter = 10 to 14 Days of Protection   Every curve of RECO Mask is carefully designed and crafted.  Wearing a mask with style is no longer a dream.  RECO Mask vs. Other masks  To make your breathing experience more pleasant, we have designed the scented botanical filters that are infused with natural essential oils.

<p>The sourcing of hemp materials has been the biggest challenge for us so far.  Hemp fibers are very robust and resistant. Processing it to become a soft material is very difficult. Due to the low demand for hemp textiles there are very few manufacturers worldwide. We looked at productions from all over the world and in the end we chose the best one. </p>

Be Sustainable. Be Free.After 10 months of development, many prototypes, many discussions and opinions, we have developed the 1st modern backpack with an outer material made of 100% hemp.     A lot of space for the daily lifestyle and beyond. The outer material is made of 100% hemp. The inside is fastened with a robust mixed fabric made out of hemp & organic cotton. The accessories, such as the handle and ribbons, are made out of recycled materials. When choosing the fabrics, special attention was paid to quality and ecological footprint.We have used high quality and durable STS zippers. The shoulder straps and the laptop compartment are both padded.Our fabrics are also odorless, so they do not smell of Marijuana.     Hampley I Rush - BlackNo matter what color you choose, turning heads is guaranteed.    Designed for everyday use, the Hampley Rush, measuring 38.5 x 30 x 11 cm and with a capacity of 13 litres, is ideal for city and country trips.To create additional storage space, it has an anti-theft pocket on the back, two side pockets and a front pocket with zip. The back compartment measures 20 x 12 cm.Inside, the backpack also has a laptop compartment that can easily accommodate a 13"" laptop.   Polyester and other synthetic materials, such as nylon and artificial leather (polyurethane), are made from crude oil and are therefore pure plastic.  They contribute to the destruction of the environment.  Plastic damages the environment during production, during and after use.According to Greenpeace, about 49% of all textiles today are made of polyester, and the trend is rising. Although we now have the ability to recycle old plastic and synthetic textiles, material is only recyclable to a limited extent and this does not solve the problem of microplastics. 1 Million Sold Plastic BackpacksOver 1 million backpacks made of synthetic materials were sold in Germany in 2017. In the backpack industry, almost all backpacks are made of synthetic fibers. Why not save resources and avoid pollution?    Since 2016 we have been working on sustainable materials and are convinced that hemp has the greatest chance, as a fiber plant, of replacing synthetic material completely.  Hemp has almost completely disappeared from the textile industry over the last 100 years, despite hemp fibers being the most sustainable and durable fibers out there.
According to the Consumer Initiative Germany, 25% of all pesticides are used in cotton fields. Hemp does not require any environmentally harmful pesticides or herbicides for cultivation. This protects the farmers, protects the groundwater, and prevents bee mortality.  
Growing hemp saves one of the most important resources on our planet: water. Compared to cotton we can save up to 80% water during the growth phase. 
Hemp is very efficient. It uses sunlight better than almost any other plant. Therefore it grows very fast and we have high yields. Hemp can grow about 4 meters in 100 days. 
Hemp can be grown almost everywhere on the earth. Cotton, on the other hand, can only grow in very warm areas of the earth, i.e. where pests have particularly good climatic conditions and where there is often a shortage of water anyway. 
 
 
 
 
A long way - But we made it.
 
The sourcing of hemp materials has been the biggest challenge for us so far.  Hemp fibers are very robust and resistant. Processing it to become a soft material is very difficult. Due to the low demand for hemp textiles there are very few manufacturers worldwide. We looked at productions from all over the world and in the end we chose the best one. 
The quality of our fabrics is excellent and our production is committed to social responsibility. Employees are treated fairly and in addition to the many certifications, social projects are supported.
After 10 months of development, many prototypes, many discussions and opinions, we have developed the 1st modern backpack made from 100% hemp.
     It is important to us that a sustainable and social supply chain is maintained.Our suppliers are therefore awarded with one of the most important certifications.               DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS - ONE GOALIt is our mission to provide the best sustainable backpacks. We all come from different backgrounds and combine our strengths to make the backpacks of tomorrow.    Be part of the movement!   This picture was taken during the shooting of our crowdfunding video.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Bonjour!</strong></h2>
<p>We created our online company<strong> Avenue Petit Lou, LLC</strong> two years ago. We are an <u>eco-friendly business</u> and our goal is to only use <strong>high-quality natural fabrics like organic cotton, bamboo, and hemp.</strong></p>
<p>Anne-Marie Martens and Marjorie Joys are the mother/daughter team behind <strong>Avenue Petit Lou, LLC</strong>, a collection of organic and natural children’s boutiques that offer clothing, home décor, toys, and baby products. The pair is also the co-authors of<strong> the bilingual children’s book</strong> <u>The Twins Mia &amp; Mateo: Daddy’s Little Helpers</u> and are currently working on a second and third book that continue these series of adventures.</p>
<p><i>Anne-Marie is a mother of four and a grandmother; Marjorie is a mom herself. Together, they have a strong background in design, early childhood education, and fashion. Both grew up and lived in Belgium before coming to the U.S., which has delightfully influenced their fashion tastes. </i></p>
<p>The clothing line was initially Anne-Marie’s idea. Sewing and fashion design have always been a part of her family heritage, with a grandmother who designed and made ballroom dresses for her six daughters, and her own mother’s children's boutique, selling a variety of chic, stylish, French apparel. Anne-Marie's inspiration began in her childhood, spending her evenings' sewing, knitting, and crocheting. Her dream has always been to design her own clothing line.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Growing our own clothing line is our next step to support parents, children, and the environment. And one that involves families in the process!</strong></p>

<p>You will get to <u>choose </u>your own fabrics and <u>personalize</u> each item through color choices offered on our website.<i> For example, with the Foxy Overall, the pockets, tail, and ears will be optional; you will be able to mix and match different fabrics to your own personalized preference.</i></p>

About the Buddysaurus

Buddysaurus was started as a comic series on Facebook to remind everyone how important our buddies are, and how we can become better buddies. 






The Buddysaurus have a dream:
Their dream is to propel themselves to a higher dimension - from 2D (comics) to 3D (products), to be mass produced and live meaningfully with you, serving you through their unique features while reminding you about your Buddies !




Introducing Long Neck & Spiky in their product forms:


Long Neck can take different types of phones (Apple, Samsung, LG... etc)
The slot is 10.5mm wide, which can accommodate most types of cord and jet :-)






You may add eyes onto them !
Long Neck & Spiky are in ""minimalistic"" product form, while we will include a set of stickers (of eyes) so that you can have some fun with them, and even custom design their eyes !





Behind the Buddysaurus
Hello, this is YC Chan who drew the Buddysaurus comics and developed them into  products. I am an Industrial Designer and an Inventor, also teaching at the Emily Carr University of Art & Design in Vancouver Canada.



I’m glad that I have someone walking with me in my life, just like the Buddysaurus.

I learned a lot from my buddies, and I want to share with everyone how important our buddies are; through the Buddysaurus products, I also want to bring some inspiration to you so that you can become a better buddy !






Show your Buddies you cherish them, using the Buddysaurus

Your ""buddies"" may be your best friends, your spouse, your parents, your mentors... show them and tell them they mean so much to you !
Gift them Long Neck & Spiky to remind them about you, and to give thanks to their support through your life !!
We can make this world a better place, by performing an act of kindness at a time, starting with your buddies !






Please back us !


Your support is the key to materialize the Buddysaurus - by adopting Long Neck & Spiky, or pick one or more items from the perk list:


















On top of the 4 basic Perks, here are combos for you to choose:


Multiple sets are great as gifts to multiple friends, large families and for retail sales !



Where will your support (the funds) go ?

This Indiegogo campaign actualizes the Buddysaurus by funding for the tooling and manufacturing costs - these diagrams can explain what ""tooling"" is about:




Your support covers these expensive solid steel tools, and also other items such as the development costs for the electronics (circuit design and tooling for the USB Hub + SD reader in Spiky), and the material + labour costs to manufacture the products, and the printing and set-up fees etc for the storybooks and cards... 
You probably prefer we do not go into detail here.


The most important part of this project is your participation - the Buddysaurus Team cannot do this campaign alone.
We need you ! 
Please tell your Buddies about this project, ask them to support it and spread the Buddysaurus idea: ""to remember your Buddies, and to become a better Buddy"" !!













About manufacturing: getting it done with quality assurance
We have partnered up a manufacturing company in Hong Kong who has great reputation. They have an experienced engineering team to get everything done to the highest quality - from the bodies of Long Neck & Spiky (injection folded in quality recyclable plastic) to the electronic components of Spiky (which will be supplied from reliable manufacturers).
To assure you our team is capable of putting it through, here are some references - a toy vehicle series, an electronic product YC Chan designed in the past, and of course the development sketches and models / prototypes of the Buddysaurus:

Thanks you very much for your support, especially taking your time to read it to the end here - please back the Buddysaurus Project now !
Let's change the world  TOGETHER, by performing one act of kindness at a time, starting with your buddies !! 
Every bit of your participation counts !!!

<p>Welcome to Tubes! Here in the Canadian prairies we can have painfully cold winters.</p>
<p>Do you spend countless hours in cold arenas for hockey, or in outdoor football stands - where the football season ends after winter begins? How about trying to enjoy other winter activities or spectator sports, or working outdoors? There are many days where gloves aren't enough to keep away the frigid bite of the cold. Some of us have difficulty wearing, or even finding our gloves. There are just not enough cups of hot chocolate or coffee to keep the pain of cold hands away . We know because we have felt this pain.</p>
<p>We know there are others who share our pain and Tubes can help.</p>

<p><strong>Why Tubes? </strong>What makes Tubes unique is Tubes have an <strong>INTERIOR POCKET FOR HEAT PACKS</strong>, <strong>thick thermal layers</strong>, and interior tabs for the<strong> detachable, adjustable Body Strap</strong> for Grab and Go ease.

<p>Whether you are on the sidelines, in the stands, at the rink, enjoying a walk in the park, time at the ski hill, a teacher at outdoor supervision - Tubes are the answer. Tubes cuddly soft plush interior and thick thermal layers make it the perfect solution to protect cold hands from the elements.</p>
<p><i>A ""Muff"" you say</i>? Visually, Vintage Tubes appear to be a twist off a Vintage Muff, hence the name 'Vintage'.  </p>

<p>    And our impact doesn’t end there! We donate all our net profits to women entrepreneurs in 11 developing countries. We chose to help women primarily because they are statistically more likely to invest in the “important things” including nutrition, housing and education. This leads to a two-pronged result: a better quality of life for the children and empowering the women behind them.</p>

</div> <div> <p>   Why did we call this bra Zarina, you ask? As a nice touch, we name all the pieces in our collection after the names of the women we invest in. In this case we are investing in Zarina Bibi whom lives in Pakistan and creates an income for herself by recycling knitwear. You can see her story on the RubyMoon blog (<a href=""http://www.rubymoon.org.uk/blog"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.rubymoon.org.uk/blog</a>)</p>
<h3>Our campaign<br/>
</h3> <ul> <li>
<p>We aim to raise enough money to manufacture the first production run of 300 bras - delivered to you this July. This will allow RubyMoon to fund our first full collection launch. This will take us, as a company, from the 'ethical edge' to mainstream retailers and beyond!</p>
</li> <li>
<p>We have an exciting range of perks including the bra itself. RubyMoon have spent a long time researching what makes a  bra desirable- whether it's for swimming, yoga, aerobics- in and out of the water, a kick-boxing session or that you just want a good-looking bra that's completely comfortable and supportive, including for larger women. We will ask you your bra size after the campaign ends- and send you a how to measure tutorial so that you will be confident that you are ordering correctly.</p>
</li> <li>
<p>If we do not reach our goal we will use the donations to make samples of leggings and swimwear that we will then crowd fund in early summer- we won't give up!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> If we do go over our target we will be able to offer a selection of swim bottoms and active leggings to match your bra!  </p>

<p>    RubyMoon are ready to go and can deliver your product by early July. We can't wait to bring this exciting product to
 market and thank you for your support.<br/></p>

<p>    The biggest potential challenge comes down to sizing and ensuring our customers select the right size for them and we have wearer tested the product for over one year and on over 50 women of all various cup sizes with a particular focus on small backs and larger cup sizes. We are happy to help guide customers in choosing the correct size for you. If you are unhappy with your purchase for any reason, we want to make it right.

We've been making ethical & sustainable swim and active wear for 5 years and due to high demand, we are now offering a new high-tech supportive bra called 'Zarina'.




 

   With over 25 years of experience in lingerie/swim design, our team has perfected the art of creating a comfortable and supportive bra, whether it be in the office, the commute home, the pool or the gym.




Please see international size charts in our image gallery

    Using an innovative new fabric with exceptional benefits, the Zarina bra will be brought to life through your help and kind donations – (and you can be the first wear this innovative bra!) We were challenged to bring the very best versatile bra to market, that's both aesthetically and ethically pleasing. Research shows that there is a higher demand for a clean cut bra, smooth bra without the seams, stripes and panels – that’s where Rubymoon’s Zarina bra comes in!






   As a result of the campaign, RubyMoon will be able to launch an entire new collection for Summer 2017! Meaning everyone will be able to enjoy the entire new range of swimwear, leggings & sports gear - proudly made in Europe in a transparent and ethical supply chain with 42% less carbon emissions. 




    And our impact doesn’t end there! We donate all our net profits to women entrepreneurs in 11 developing countries. We chose to help women primarily because they are statistically more likely to invest in the “important things” including nutrition, housing and education. This leads to a two-pronged result: a better quality of life for the children and empowering the women behind them.



     Why did we call this bra Zarina, you ask? As a nice touch, we name all the pieces in our collection after the names of the women we invest in. In this case we are investing in Zarina Bibi whom lives in Pakistan and creates an income for herself by recycling knitwear. You can see her story on the RubyMoon blog (www.rubymoon.org.uk/blog)
Our campaign
  
We aim to raise enough money to manufacture the first production run of 300 bras - delivered to you this July. This will allow RubyMoon to fund our first full collection launch. This will take us, as a company, from the 'ethical edge' to mainstream retailers and beyond!
 
We have an exciting range of perks including the bra itself. RubyMoon have spent a long time researching what makes a  bra desirable- whether it's for swimming, yoga, aerobics- in and out of the water, a kick-boxing session or that you just want a good-looking bra that's completely comfortable and supportive, including for larger women. We will ask you your bra size after the campaign ends- and send you a how to measure tutorial so that you will be confident that you are ordering correctly.
 
If we do not reach our goal we will use the donations to make samples of leggings and swimwear that we will then crowd fund in early summer- we won't give up!


 If we do go over our target we will be able to offer a selection of swim bottoms and active leggings to match your bra!

 market and thank you for your support.

<p>More recently, as dramatized in the 2005 film “The World’s Fasted Indian”, a number of land speed records were set by Burt Munro from New Zealand between 1962 and 1967 using a 1920’s modified Indian Scout. The Indian Motorbike was still able to set the pace 50 years on. Truly timeless! </p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Many designs were considered and rejected after canvassing comments from friends, relatives and acquaintances, as they didn't capture the essence of what we were about.

<p>Finally, drawing on the inspiration of the Indian Motorcycle speedometer design, we came up with four options that we believe will become classics in their own right. </p>

<br/>
<p><b>•	Affordability:</b> We wanted to be able to sell the Camissi Watch at under $US 150. Important in achieving this goal was to find a manufacturer that could deliver top quality at an affordable price. We partnered with a 25 years plus veteran of watch manufacturing to successfully find the right watch manufacturer for the price and quality we wanted to achieve. </p>
<p><b>•	Practicality</b>: While styling was important, we also wanted a practical timepiece that was usable for everyday wear. It needed to be made from quality components that could withstand the rigours of day to day use, and be more than just a dress watch. We also wanted to have in-built flexibility so that a different look could be achieved simply through a change of the watch band. </p></span><h4><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;""><b>The End Result:</b></span></h4>

<p>For secure transport and future storage to protect your investment, the watches are supplied in a curved retro style black P.U. leather watch case. </p>
<p>The matte solid stainless steel case is designed to look stylish when used as a dress watch, yet durable enough to handle outdoor or physical activities. The case’s robust qualities are complemented by mineral glass to provide strength in a cost effective material. </p>
<p>We have chosen the Citizen Miyota Movement to power the watch, as it has proven to be very accurate and built to last for many years. These movements are made with mercury-free batteries and in RoHS compliant facilities. </p>
<p>The battery is of Japan origin with an expected life of 3 years. Changing the battery in the future is a simple 5 minutes’ exercise. </p>

The three of us have long been fans of classic styling. Looks and designs which recall eras and fashions of times past, where quality was a standard and things were built to last. 
We love items which are antique yet modern in look, and sophisticated enough to feel at home in today's fashion stakes. We wanted to bring this passion for classic style into developing a range of merchandise that would capture this essence of yesteryear, and over time build a brand and range of products that would be synonymous with timeless styling and quality at an affordable price.
Our starting point is the Camissi Watch which we hope can be the forerunner of a range of highly sort after timepieces and other quality merchandise as we expand and grow.

Many designs were considered and rejected after canvassing comments from friends, relatives and acquaintances, as they didn't capture the essence of what we were about. We also looked into practicality of design vs function, as a watch should not only look good, but it should work well as a timepiece.
Finally, drawing on the inspiration of the Indian Motorcycle speedometer design, we came up with four options that we believe will become classics in their own right. 
The Camissi range of Retro Style watches;



•	Affordability: We wanted to be able to sell the Camissi Watch at under $US 150. Important in achieving this goal was to find a manufacturer that could deliver top quality at an affordable price. We partnered with a 25 years plus veteran of watch manufacturing to successfully find the right watch manufacturer for the price and quality we wanted to achieve. 
•	Practicality: While styling was important, we also wanted a practical timepiece that was usable for everyday wear. It needed to be made from quality components that could withstand the rigours of day to day use, and be more than just a dress watch. We also wanted to have in-built flexibility so that a different look could be achieved simply through a change of the watch band. The End Result:

We believe that we have met our challenges and reached our goals with the Camissi Watch. Quality, design and an affordable price.


The watch design echoes the speedometers found on the classic Indian Motorcycles. A choice of 4 different Dial and Leather Band options allows you to select the look that best suits you. 
The Camissi range consists of: 
1. Daytona: Named after the Daytona Beach International Speedway in Florida USA. Used for motor cycle racing in 1964 - 1965.

A speedometer inspired face in black with white in-filled hands and time markings. Numerals are 0800 to 0400. Fitted with a black leather padded band with cream contrast side stitch. Bonus contrast leather band supplied with pin removing tool and two spare pins. 
 2. Monza: Named after the Monza Circuit in Italy. Used for motor cycle racing from 1949 - 1987.

A speedometer inspired face in Indian Red and Cream background. Numerals are 0800 to 0400. Cream in-filled hands and black time markings. Fitted with brown leather padded band with cream contrast side stitch. Bonus contrast leather band supplied with pin removing tool and two spare pins.
3. San Marino: Named after the San Marino motorcyle Grand Prix held on the Rimini Coast of Italy since 1981.

A speedometer inspired minimalist face Indian Red and Cream background featuring the numerals 08 to 04. Cream in-filled hands and black time markings. Fitted with a brown leather padded band with cream contrast side stitch. Bonus contrast leather band supplied with pin removing tool. 
4. Indianapolis: Named after the Indianapolis Circuit, which has featured 8 Grand Prix motor cycle races since 2008.

A speedometer inspired face in a Cream background. Numerals are 0800 to 0400. Cream in-filled hands and black time markings. Fitted with brown leather padded band with cream contrast side stitch. Bonus contrast leather band supplied with pin removing tool.     
Common Features on all Models:
All styles will be supplied with a bonus contrast leather band that can be easily changed over using the supplied pin removing tool. The Pin Removing Tool is supplied in a clear pouch with 2 extra band pins. 
The look of each watch can therefore be changed according to the occasion or to fit in with whatever you are wearing. 
For secure transport and future storage to protect your investment, the watches are supplied in a curved retro style black P.U. leather watch case. 
The matte solid stainless steel case is designed to look stylish when used as a dress watch, yet durable enough to handle outdoor or physical activities. The case’s robust qualities are complemented by mineral glass to provide strength in a cost effective material. 
We have chosen the Citizen Miyota Movement to power the watch, as it has proven to be very accurate and built to last for many years. These movements are made with mercury-free batteries and in RoHS compliant facilities. 
The battery is of Japan origin with an expected life of 3 years. Changing the battery in the future is a simple 5 minutes’ exercise. 

Miyota 3 hand Quartz Movement

The watch is also water resistant to 10ATMs or 100 meters. Resistant enough to accompany you to the beach or for general swimming. We do not recommend diving however!

Camissi Watch 2 years Warranty:
We believe in the quality of our watches, which is why we will offer a 2 Year Warranty on the watch’s internal parts and workmanship. If anything should happen to your watch within the first 2 years, you can send it back to us for repair or replacement.    
Timeline:
April 2016:   Backers Surveyed by email for Design Choice
May 2016:   Funding Campaign Concludes. Book Production and Order Materials
June 2016:   Production Begins. Stock Shipped to Us for Final QC Inspection.               Early Bird Backers' Watches are Shipped Out.
July 2016:    Balance of First production Shipped Out.

Risks & Challenges We are confident that we have covered all aspects of the manufacturing process as our chosen manufacturer has a proven history of supplying according to the quality and specification levels set. Any non-conforming product will be picked up during the Quality Inspection stage and replaced prior to dispatch. There may be some minor delays in leaving the manufacturing facility should this occur. Once production has been completed, and we receive the watches, we will post these out to our backers straight away. There may be some postal delays, depending on the postal service, but we will keep a record of what has been sent out and when, so that if there is a delay in receipt, we can follow through to try to locate where the package may be. For Camissi in the medium to longer term, the most prominent challenge we will have will be marketing our product and getting the word out there. Individually and collectively we do have extensive marketing experience with other products and brands, so this is something which we can confidently address over time. 
    Other Ways You Can Help To get sufficient backing on this project we need people to know about it. If you like the look of these watches and know someone else who also might, please let them know about Camissi Watches. Pass the word around and you can help us get this off the ground using the Indiegogo share tools or any other way you can make a noise about this.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Manufacturing and Testing</h2>
<p>Unlike commonly used complex additive manufacturing processes such as Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) for making custom shoes and insoles, <strong>we use a fast and cost effective extrusion based 3D printing process to fabricate OneSoles</strong>. The synthetic skin material (US Patent Pending 15/204,353) which can be range from ultra soft to hard, can be dispensed via nozzle attachments at specific sections of our insoles, using our proprietary manufacturing process. The resulting insoles are extremely durable with minimal tear propagation.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks and Challenges</h2>
<p>We have created multiple working prototypes of OneSoles and tested them on Beta users around the world. We have set conservative dates for delivery, and we are very confident that we can reliably deliver OneSoles to backers within the timelines we have promised.</p>
<p>We have a finalized bill of materials, meaning we know what the fixed costs will be for fabricating the first 1000 pairs of insoles. All of our teammates being college students with limited budget, we would require funding for purchasing multiple 3D printers, silicone based materials, and packaging materials.</p>
<p>In the event of a highly successful campaign with a large volume of orders (internationally), there is a risk of delays in fulfillment as we scale up our manufacturing capacity. In order to address this risk, we have provided conservative timelines for delivery.</p>
<p>Every project has risks. We feel we have done what we can to manage them and are completely confident in our ability to meet our commitments to our backers.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
<p><strong>   1. What if the insole doesn't fit me?</strong></p>
<p>Ans: We will get your feedback and ship you a new one for free in less than a week.</p>
<p><strong>   2. I have heard about three or four other 3D Printed insole brands in the market. How is OneSoles different?</strong></p>
<p>Ans: The novelty of our technology is not just the 3D printing process, but <strong>our patent pending ""Skin-Like"" material</strong>. To date, all 3D printing processes use a standard material (hard or flexible). We are the first ones to be able to print soft ""Skin-Like"" materials just for your foot skin type (any stiffness-ultra soft/soft/medium/hard) and that too at different sections of your insole to ensure effective foot stress reduction. <u>Also, all other 3D printed custom insoles typically come in a price range of <strong>$80-$500</strong>, which conform to your foot shape, but does no better to your foot than standard insoles due to the use of standard materials</u>. <strong>OneSoles</strong> are just for <strong>$29/pair</strong> and designed for your foot with the right structural and material supports.</p>
<p>   <strong>3<strong>. Why </strong>do I need different materials in an insole?</strong></p>
<p>Ans: Every section of your foot (Heel, Mid-foot, Arch, Metatarsals and Toes) goes through different levels of stresses due to your specific daily activities. Incorporating softer materials at high stress sections will provide adequate cushioning and ensure effective pain relief.</p>
<p> <strong>  4. How do I know which foot section needs what material support?</strong></p>
<p>Ans: First way is based on your feelings (heel pain or arch pain etc.). Second way is to wet your feet and stand on a sheet of paper which will indicate to the high stress points on your foot. If you communicate this information to us (via picture attachment), we will make your custom insole accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>   5. I don't know what I want out of my insole?</strong></p>
<p>Ans: Let us know your foot problems, and we will send our recommendation for you.</p>
<p><strong>   6. Why not Dr. Scholl's or any other custom insole brand?</strong></p>
<p>Ans: They don't really make custom insoles. They have 4-5 standard options for you, not a specific design for your foot need. Only we have this!</p>
<p><strong>   7. My friend does fine just with the $10 moldable insoles in the market, why do I need OneSoles?</strong></p>
<p>Ans: First, everyone's daily activities and foot needs are different. Thus, an insole which works for one person may not work for another. Second, if you like to buy $ 50- $ 200 shoes every six month to look good, why not invest $29 for a year or two to feel good! </p>
<p><strong>   8. I have blisters/sores on my foot. Can you make me an insole to wear with that?</strong></p>
<p>Ans: Just share with us the location and size of the blister/sore on your foot as additional information when you order, and we will work with you to get a perfect insole for you.</p>
<p><strong>   9. What after Indiegogo/Kickstarter?</strong></p>
<p>Ans: If we are able to reach our funding goals, we plan to set up an online store to sell our custom insoles. We will also try to further reduce the prices to help people in poor countries, where $29 is still a lot to pay for any shoe or insole. Additionally, we will be looking for partnerships to expand our business in the US and internationally.</p>
<p><strong>   10. Will your App work on an I-Phone?</strong></p>
<p>Ans: Our App is currently available for Android users, and needs further improvements and updates for ios users, which will happen in the next 2 months.</p>
<p> <strong>  11. I have diabetic ulcer, will OneSoles work for me?</strong></p>
<p>Ans: For very specific foot conditions such as severe diabetic ulcers and cancerous sores, medical prescriptions may be required before we recommend an insole for you.</p>

Join us in our journey to make the most affordable high quality custom insoles for everyone, including developing countries where they cannot afford over $10 for shoes 
The Ultimate Customizable Insoles
OneSoles insoles are the highest quality custom insoles in the market and affordable for everyone at just $29/pair. The most unique product features are:

Extremely High Durability (with negligible tear propagation) 
Washable via washing machine/hand wash (say no to foot odor!)
Custom support for High Arch/Flat Foot
Custom ""Skin-Like"" materials for your specific foot needs (US Patent Pending 15/204,353)
Wearable with Blisters/Soars/Ulcers
Most Efficient Process (Needs 2 Pictures of your foot) 


At OneSoles, we like it simple and feel that insoles doesn't have to be cool looking or high-tech! They should be affordable, last long, easy to maintain, and specifically address YOUR foot problems, not global foot problems!   
Our 3-STEP Process
Our 3-step ordering process uses an App which will take you less than a minute of your time to complete your order:

Take two pictures of your foot (Top and Side View)
Attach Third Picture (Bottom View: for Blisters/Sores/Ulcers)
Attach Fourth Picture (Foot Stress Map: Wet your foot and step on a white paper) 


Select your foot Size/Add Extra Details 
Order Confirmation and Processing (Less than a day)


We DON'T create complex 3D foot models with 20+ pictures, as its a waste of your and our time! Our inbuilt algorithm with two-pictures gets your foot shape and arch information, that's all we need.

Why OneSoles?
Why should you buy OneSoles when their are so many insole brands and so called ""custom insole"" brands out there?

What can you Customize?
With OneSoles, you can customize:

Foot Shape (Arch)
Materials at High Stress Points (Synthetic Skin, US Patent Pending 15/204,353)
Blister/Ulcer Isolation (Any size or location, US Patent Pending 62/360,773)
Colors


Beta Testing
We have tested our insoles on beta users around the world and this is what they have to say:

I have been working for important designer labels for twenty years.  So, I have decided to create my brand and sell it around the world with the name Michelangelo.Thanks to my knowledge in the manufacturing of the leather and shoe goods, I have familiarity with suppliers and craftsmen, who are necessary for the production.
The goal of this campaign is to offer you a leather footwear of top quality, completely handmade. 
I have chosen, exclusively for this campaign,four new models of the Collection 2016, in limited edition . The names of the models are: Firenze, Roma, Milano and Venezia.In this campaign, I would like to suggest you the Michelangelo collection, which is available in two different colors and four models.Michelangelo is made with finest raw materials: calfskins and lining calfskins, which are powered and tanned in Italy. The sole is in genuine leather with a rubber and leather heel. The footwear is made with nails in the sole, as only the local and expert craftsmen do.For my shoes, I have chosen the following colors: Black and Brown. The shoes are sized from 38 to 48 extra large.Michelangelo Project:In the picture below, you can see the skin cut models, the soles, the yellow inner liners and the plantars. You can also notice the prototypes for the fit test.Manufacturing phases:

Cutting: the cutting is made with an auto cad-cam machine, numerically controlled.
Skiving: it
consists in the skin thinning, for the following working phases, to assure a
perfect donning.
Connecting: it consists in the assembling and sewing the vamp in
all its part.
Assembling:
it consists in the assembling the vamp to the sole
in order to clean and dress the shoe and finish it to have a top quality
product. To do this, I will use only raw materials.In  addition to a top quality footwear, which is completely handmade, you can also choose the sole that you like the most! In fact, you can select the sole and then the model of Milano, Roma, Firenze, Venezia shoes.Shown below, you can see the three different models of tip:Round TipSweet Tip

What We Need & What You Get 

I need your help in order to realize my project and to achieve the following goal. I would like to create the Michelangelo’s shoes brand and place it around the world. I know, in fact, how is important to wear a comfortable footwear in order to fight the stress of the daily life. That is why, I have decided to create shoes of the highest quality, made in Italy, with only selected materials in order to prevent allergies. You can wear it also without socks! I will use your funds in this way:


With this campaign I have the chance to create my
shoes, reduce the costs of the production and  realize other models of the same
quality at a very low price.
I will offer you these footwear at the special launch
prize of $ 429 USD. The selling price is $ 900 USD. Other brands sell the same
shoes at $ 1900 USD.

elegant for man who loves to distinguish himself. Then, I will produce other
stylish footwear in different colors.

The production is estimated to 6- 10 pairs of shoes a
day. I will give a sets of lots, following the order of the perk’s booking.

The shipping costs are calculated exceptionally for the following countries:

<h3>THE FLIPMO STORY</h3>
<p>Over the last 12 months, we've thought about nothing else but creating the best device which can be held in the palm of your hand, and be able to carry power, sync data and store your files. </p>
<p>We had to do something about this. We thought about applications to carry this device which led us to lean on creating a super slim device for a wallet or a purse but after carrying out months of market research realized that not everyone carried a wallet, some prefer to carry cards and cash in the pocket, so what was the one essential item apart from our phones we all had to keep with us or we weren’t getting in? </p>
<p>THE KEYS and there it started… the vision of creating a super product sized close to the newer style of car keys, but how were we going to incorporate all the functions we were looking to achieve in a shape which could blend into the keys?</p>
<p>One morning our CEO is sitting there pushing his Zippo lid back and forth and there it was – this set our designer Tom off!!!  Creating countless concepts and working with our Polymer battery and circuit board partners to create a super fit perfectly sized shape to meet our vision.  At this stage we still didn’t know what this super device was going to be called and only as we were creating the story board of the Promo video we thought FLIP MORE which evolved into FLIPMO. Whether it be carrying around more music that your phone memory can’t handle anymore, that extra charge to keep you on that essential phone call before the battery runs out or just the pure usefulness of having an easy to carry and sturdy cable to hand that won’t break. ONE DEVICE INTEGRATED WITH ALL OUR ESSENTIALS is how the team at FLIPMO would best describe this product.</p>

<h2>The Journey</h2>
<div align=""justify"">The
path from a simple idea to a full working device is quite cumbersome.
We spent many hours, holidays, sleepless nights, and long
negotiations together to develop a product we could be proud of.<br/>The
biggest challenge was to integrate all of our features in combination
with qualitative hardware. We have seen many devices, but none of
them compiled all of our requirements. Some looked cheap, others were
poor quality and others not suitable for kids. The results were quite
disappointing!<br/><p>There
was one crucial question that remained unanswered: “What would be
the best device that could, at the same time integrate our features
and safe people? A device that could easily be used and worn by
kids?”<br/>After
our market research in Europe and Asia, the solution was obvious: a
Smart-watch…<br/>From
that moment on, we started with the concept and design of the Junior
Safewatch™, while our engineers worked to integrate all our
features into this small device.<br/>Today
we are at the final stage to get the Junior Safewatch™ on the
world-wide market. Unfortunately, we are missing one important thing,
your help...</p>

negotiations together to develop a product we could be proud of.The
biggest challenge was to integrate all of our features in combination
with qualitative hardware. We have seen many devices, but none of
them compiled all of our requirements. Some looked cheap, others were
poor quality and others not suitable for kids. The results were quite
disappointing!There
was one crucial question that remained unanswered: “What would be
the best device that could, at the same time integrate our features
and safe people? A device that could easily be used and worn by
kids?”After
our market research in Europe and Asia, the solution was obvious: a
Smart-watch…From
that moment on, we started with the concept and design of the Junior
Safewatch™, while our engineers worked to integrate all our
features into this small device.Today
we are at the final stage to get the Junior Safewatch™ on the
world-wide market. Unfortunately, we are missing one important thing,
your help...

<p>Hi Everyone! My name is Timi Komonibo and I'm the founder &amp; Chief Philanthropist at <a href=""www.stylelottery.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">STYLE LOTTERY</a>. Studies show that Americans send <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/07/where-does-discarded-clothing-go/374613/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">10.5 million tons of clothing to landfills every year</a>. But why should clothes be thrown away when they can be used to empower and connect people? I started STYLE LOTTERY to connect people to their community and fashion to philanthropy. I'm vying for a spot on the <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/style-lottery-the-wearweshare-tour/millennialtrain.co"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Millennial Train </a> this summer because I want to share the opportunity to ""restyle, reuse, and reward (TM)"" through fashion.</p>

</div><p>I am fundraising to be one of the entrepreneurs aboard the Millennial Train this summer. The train will be stopping in 5 cities from August 1-8th. There is a race for the first 30 people to fundraise $5,000 to get aboard the train and I want to be one of them! For me, MTP is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be inspired by my fellow entrepreneurs and change agents. Being on this train will allow me to expand STYLE LOTTERY to new cities and spark an important dialogue around fashion and philanthropy. Along this journey, I will get access to mentors, community leaders, as well as funding opportunities to help my team and I develop STYLE LOTTERY into the dynamic fashion philanthropy startup that I know it can be.</p><div>

<p>For my MTP project, I will be hosting ""pay-what-you-can"" pop-up swaps in 5 U.S. cities. I invite you to meet up with me in the city closest to you (Pittsburg, Chicago, Kansas City, Alberquerque, or Los Angeles). Bring your lightly used clothing items so you can swap with people in your community. We're adding a fun twist and giving our guests the option to ""Pay-What-You-Can"" for their items. On the road, we will share the stories of the people we meet under the #wearweshare hashtag</p>
<p>Statistics show that people have a alarming amount of clothing in their closet that they don't wear (i.e. a study showed that 85% of women had clothes in their closets that don't fit.). When I first started swapping, I hosted events where women could swap clothes and purge out their closets. Style Lottery aims to change the way people get rid of clothing they no longer want. We live in a fast-fashion world that follows trends in the fashion world and sends unwanted clothes to landfills. I'm using the #WearWeShare Tour to put an end to that. Throughout my travels, I want to highlight the stories of your favorite clothes--- where you got them, where you've been in them, and where you're taking them next. </p></span>

<p>In 2015, Syracuse University gave Style Lottery the annual Orange Circle Award for our philanthropic work in the community. I have been doing pop-up closet swaps for several years. I have been working closely with community partners, as well as local Universities and charities to increase Style Lottery's reach and impact. By adopting a ""pay-what-you-can"" model, I am giving everyone a chance to participate at a level where they are comfortable. I believe removing the pressure of a fixed price will create social value and a sense of community. I believe every individual has something they give, as well as much that they can receive. Whether it is their clothes, money, or time, all contributions are welcome and appreciated.</p>
<p>With this MTP journey, we'd be taking Style Lottery on tour and asking strangers to share their closets with one another. What's different about our project is that we're essentially conducting a social experiment. I'm exploring the (monetary and social) value people place on their clothes. I'll also discovering ways to reduce the carbon footprints of our closets. We've tested out our methods in Texas, New York, and D.C. and now I'm looking forward to the opportunity to take Style Lottery on the road to see if we can spread fashion philanthropy to even more cities.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
</div><p>Getting people to give up items from their closets can be a challenge. We've found that once our guests release clothes they no longer wear, they open up room for items and interactions that truly spark joy! I love watching our guests discover new aesthetics and venture into new styles. They meet their neighbors and find hidden gems in their community (not to mention all the inexpensive clothes at their disposal).</p><p>But we can't have a pop-up without you! We want to meet as many people as possible so we can swap clothes and stories. This project has the potential to bridge so many gaps and we can only do it with your help.</p><div><div>

Hi Everyone! My name is Timi Komonibo and I'm the founder & Chief Philanthropist at STYLE LOTTERY. Studies show that Americans send 10.5 million tons of clothing to landfills every year. But why should clothes be thrown away when they can be used to empower and connect people? I started STYLE LOTTERY to connect people to their community and fashion to philanthropy. I'm vying for a spot on the Millennial Train  this summer because I want to share the opportunity to ""restyle, reuse, and reward (TM)"" through fashion.



I am fundraising to be one of the entrepreneurs aboard the Millennial Train this summer. The train will be stopping in 5 cities from August 1-8th. There is a race for the first 30 people to fundraise $5,000 to get aboard the train and I want to be one of them! For me, MTP is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be inspired by my fellow entrepreneurs and change agents. Being on this train will allow me to expand STYLE LOTTERY to new cities and spark an important dialogue around fashion and philanthropy. Along this journey, I will get access to mentors, community leaders, as well as funding opportunities to help my team and I develop STYLE LOTTERY into the dynamic fashion philanthropy startup that I know it can be.

The #WearWeShare Tour



For my MTP project, I will be hosting ""pay-what-you-can"" pop-up swaps in 5 U.S. cities. I invite you to meet up with me in the city closest to you (Pittsburg, Chicago, Kansas City, Alberquerque, or Los Angeles). Bring your lightly used clothing items so you can swap with people in your community. We're adding a fun twist and giving our guests the option to ""Pay-What-You-Can"" for their items. On the road, we will share the stories of the people we meet under the #wearweshare hashtag
Statistics show that people have a alarming amount of clothing in their closet that they don't wear (i.e. a study showed that 85% of women had clothes in their closets that don't fit.). When I first started swapping, I hosted events where women could swap clothes and purge out their closets. Style Lottery aims to change the way people get rid of clothing they no longer want. We live in a fast-fashion world that follows trends in the fashion world and sends unwanted clothes to landfills. I'm using the #WearWeShare Tour to put an end to that. Throughout my travels, I want to highlight the stories of your favorite clothes--- where you got them, where you've been in them, and where you're taking them next. 


To get our #WearWeShare tour on the road, I need to raise $5K to secure my seat on the train.

If this campaign is among the first 30 to reach its $5K goal, all funds raised will go to Millennial Trains Project, which is a 501(c)3 organization. Any donation you make to this campaign is tax-deductible. 
Your donation will help cover the costs of the journey and its associated programming, transportation, and hospitality fees. 
If I am not among the first 30 applicants to reach my crowdfunding goal, you will not be charged your donation.



The Impact




 
In 2015, Syracuse University gave Style Lottery the annual Orange Circle Award for our philanthropic work in the community. I have been doing pop-up closet swaps for several years. I have been working closely with community partners, as well as local Universities and charities to increase Style Lottery's reach and impact. By adopting a ""pay-what-you-can"" model, I am giving everyone a chance to participate at a level where they are comfortable. I believe removing the pressure of a fixed price will create social value and a sense of community. I believe every individual has something they give, as well as much that they can receive. Whether it is their clothes, money, or time, all contributions are welcome and appreciated.
With this MTP journey, we'd be taking Style Lottery on tour and asking strangers to share their closets with one another. What's different about our project is that we're essentially conducting a social experiment. I'm exploring the (monetary and social) value people place on their clothes. I'll also discovering ways to reduce the carbon footprints of our closets. We've tested out our methods in Texas, New York, and D.C. and now I'm looking forward to the opportunity to take Style Lottery on the road to see if we can spread fashion philanthropy to even more cities.

Getting people to give up items from their closets can be a challenge. We've found that once our guests release clothes they no longer wear, they open up room for items and interactions that truly spark joy! I love watching our guests discover new aesthetics and venture into new styles. They meet their neighbors and find hidden gems in their community (not to mention all the inexpensive clothes at their disposal).But we can't have a pop-up without you! We want to meet as many people as possible so we can swap clothes and stories. This project has the potential to bridge so many gaps and we can only do it with your help.


Other Ways You Can Help



I realize that some of you may not be able to financially support our campaign, but I'd still love your help. Here's how you can help:



HOST A CLOSET SWAP:  I'm in search of a venue to host each swap. If you're open to me using your shop or public space to set-up a walk-in closet, please let me know. Don't worry, I'm a master pop-up artist, and I can set-up and clean up in a flash. We'll be sure to give your location a lot of media attention and social media love. If you're in the area (Pittsburg, Chicago, Kansas City, Albuquerque or Los Angeles) leave me a comment or tweet me @timikomo.


ATTEND A LOCAL EVENT: We might be in your neighborhood this summer and we'd love to have you experience one of our closet swaps! Make sure you like us on our Facebook page to get updates about our pop-up locations for the MTP tour.

TELL YOUR STORY of your favorite clothing item. It only takes 15 seconds.
Upload it to Instagram or Facebook using the hashtag #WearWeShare.
SHARE OUR CAMPAIGN with your friends. Please spread the word to help our campaign get more views. Use the Indiegogo share tools to get started!



How You Can Follow The Journey
On the MTP journey, Style Lottery fans will be able to follow me on the road and see our #WearWeShare updates on our Snapchat (@StyleLottery). I will also be sharing the stories of the people I meet under Style Lottery's hashtag #wearweshare. You can also find me on Twitter and Instagram.

After the journey is completed, I will write a post dedicated to the experience on both my personal blog and Style Lottery's website. I will also share pictures and videos from the journey on my YouTube page.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>My name is Bert Woodson.  I live on St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Sublime STX Sun Protective Clothing is produced.  </p>
<p>Sublime STX is the result of two years of research, development, and testing.  We are unique in the market.</p>
<p>I have always loved the sun...I grew up in Florida and have lived in the Caribbean and Central America.  As a kid, I could be in the sun for six hours and just tan.  I'm a bit older now and I find that about an hour is all I can handle without starting to cook. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566397131/xoszae2as4pxnu0ygovr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>When I get to the point where I feel that I've had enough sun, I wear our stuff.  It's great for fishing, snorkeling, diving, windsurfing, swimming, sailing, windsurfing, horseback riding, cycling, running--you name it.  I wear a big hat, I use SPF30+ reef-friendly, organic sunscreen, UV blocking sunglasses, and rock on.  No need to cut my day short.</p>
<p>Our clothes dry very quickly.  They provide UPF50+ protection, are moisture wicking, lightweight, and treated with zinc as an antimicrobial to inhibit body odor.</p>
<p>The vibrant images are digitized from original paintings we have licensed, and the artists receive a royalty for each garment sold.  This is what makes us stand out of the crowd.</p>
<p>We have long and short sleeved men's and women's shirts, youth rash guards, shirts for kids and toddlers, buffs, hoodies, hats, and sarongs, all made with UPF50+ fabric.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566397356/lrdiipi8ldjvpijcbvda.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We also offer fashion-fit beach dresses--great as a bathing suit cover-up or casual occasions.</p>
<p>Our process is called dye-sublimation.  Each garment is dyed individually and is the result of computer-generated prints using special inks and paper.  One for the front, and one for the back.  The garment is placed in a high-pressure heat press, which turns the ink into a vapor.  It permeates the fabric and never fades or wears off.  We offer all-over prints as well as panel prints.</p>
<p>We sell our products online and we are excited to have opened our first retail store in downtown Christiansted on St. Croix on May 5th, featuring ""All Things Under The Sun"".  Although we opened in the off season, the store has been extremely well received.  The majority of our sales are the result of people seeing our customers wearing our clothing on the beaches, sailing, and out about town.  They ""have to"" know where to buy our stuff.  We are very pleased about that!</p>
<p>We are under full production and look forward to expanding our markets to include more stores, as well as wholesaling to resort-oriented boutiques.  </p>
<p>We are addressing several needs in the marketplace:</p>
<p>The Skin Cancer Foundation and Mayo Clinic--to name just two of the many respected cancer research organizations--concur that UPF50+ clothing is your first and best defense against Basil Cell and Squamous Cell Carcinomas, as well as Melanoma.  UVA and UVB rays (radiation) are the primary causes of these skin cancers.  Cellular damage is cumulative throughout our lives.  Our fabric blocks 98% of these harmful rays.</p>
<p>Standard sunscreens contain harmful chemicals, some of which are carcinogens.  Considering that your skin is the largest organ on your body, this is cause for concern.  Slathering your skin with these products is harmful.  These chemicals also kill our coral reefs.  For this reason, these products have recently been outlawed in the Hawaiian Islands, Key West, and the Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>For these reasons we highly recommend a reef-safe organic and ayurvedic sunblock.  Our favorite is Pura Veda Sun Protect 30+.  It is actually good for your skin.</p>
<p>And, we have all seen the effects of too much sun on aging...</p>
<p>Finally, there is a real void in the marketplace for great looking sun wear.  Aesthetics seem to be an afterthought.  Our designs are unique and appealing.  Everyone likes to look good.  Our vibrant designs make people happy and it's contagious....</p>

</div></div>","My name is Bert Woodson.  I live on St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Sublime STX Sun Protective Clothing is produced.  
Sublime STX is the result of two years of research, development, and testing.  We are unique in the market.
I have always loved the sun...I grew up in Florida and have lived in the Caribbean and Central America.  As a kid, I could be in the sun for six hours and just tan.  I'm a bit older now and I find that about an hour is all I can handle without starting to cook. 

When I get to the point where I feel that I've had enough sun, I wear our stuff.  It's great for fishing, snorkeling, diving, windsurfing, swimming, sailing, windsurfing, horseback riding, cycling, running--you name it.  I wear a big hat, I use SPF30+ reef-friendly, organic sunscreen, UV blocking sunglasses, and rock on.  No need to cut my day short.
Our clothes dry very quickly.  They provide UPF50+ protection, are moisture wicking, lightweight, and treated with zinc as an antimicrobial to inhibit body odor.
The vibrant images are digitized from original paintings we have licensed, and the artists receive a royalty for each garment sold.  This is what makes us stand out of the crowd.
We have long and short sleeved men's and women's shirts, youth rash guards, shirts for kids and toddlers, buffs, hoodies, hats, and sarongs, all made with UPF50+ fabric.

We also offer fashion-fit beach dresses--great as a bathing suit cover-up or casual occasions.
Our process is called dye-sublimation.  Each garment is dyed individually and is the result of computer-generated prints using special inks and paper.  One for the front, and one for the back.  The garment is placed in a high-pressure heat press, which turns the ink into a vapor.  It permeates the fabric and never fades or wears off.  We offer all-over prints as well as panel prints.
We sell our products online and we are excited to have opened our first retail store in downtown Christiansted on St. Croix on May 5th, featuring ""All Things Under The Sun"".  Although we opened in the off season, the store has been extremely well received.  The majority of our sales are the result of people seeing our customers wearing our clothing on the beaches, sailing, and out about town.  They ""have to"" know where to buy our stuff.  We are very pleased about that!
We are under full production and look forward to expanding our markets to include more stores, as well as wholesaling to resort-oriented boutiques.  
We are addressing several needs in the marketplace:
The Skin Cancer Foundation and Mayo Clinic--to name just two of the many respected cancer research organizations--concur that UPF50+ clothing is your first and best defense against Basil Cell and Squamous Cell Carcinomas, as well as Melanoma.  UVA and UVB rays (radiation) are the primary causes of these skin cancers.  Cellular damage is cumulative throughout our lives.  Our fabric blocks 98% of these harmful rays.
Standard sunscreens contain harmful chemicals, some of which are carcinogens.  Considering that your skin is the largest organ on your body, this is cause for concern.  Slathering your skin with these products is harmful.  These chemicals also kill our coral reefs.  For this reason, these products have recently been outlawed in the Hawaiian Islands, Key West, and the Virgin Islands.
For these reasons we highly recommend a reef-safe organic and ayurvedic sunblock.  Our favorite is Pura Veda Sun Protect 30+.  It is actually good for your skin.
And, we have all seen the effects of too much sun on aging...
Finally, there is a real void in the marketplace for great looking sun wear.  Aesthetics seem to be an afterthought.  Our designs are unique and appealing.  Everyone likes to look good.  Our vibrant designs make people happy and it's contagious....

Our target for funding for this campaign is $25,000.  This will pay for production of our perks, as well as increase our production capabilities.  We will also add exciting new products to our line.
Sorry--due to expected volume of orders we will be unable to make perk substitutions, but visit our website for additional stuff.
It's important to get a great start at the gate.  For anyone who joins us as a backer during the first 48 hours of going live, we're throwing in a panel shirt of the painting ""Cool Blue"" by Brian Sylvester ($58.00 value) on us.  We appreciate your support!  This offer expires at 12:00 PM on August 22nd.

""Cool Blue""
First, we will fulfill our orders for our contributors.  In addition, we will offer our contributors a lifetime 10% discount on our website and free shipping when you register on our site.  We have an exciting selection to choose from and we will be adding new products and designs.
Very importantly, part of the proceeds of this campaign are being donated to the St. Croix Nature Conservancy's Coral Nursery and Reef Restoration Project.  You can read more below about the amazing work they are doing to help save our coral reefs .
If we exceed our target, funds will be used to expand the business into other markets.
If we do not reach our target funding, your contribution will be refunded.  but you can order from our site.  We'll enjoy the extra boost in business and the additional sales generated when your friends see you wearing our clothing.
Your contribution will accomplish several things.
*You'll be helping to protect your skin from cancers and premature aging.
*You'll help to protect and regenerate coral reefs by contributing to coral nurseries and reef restoration.  
*You'll reduce damage to the ocean and estuaries in general by not applying harmful sunscreens.
*You'll be supporting the arts.  Our artists receive a royalty on each garment sold.
*You'll look damn good.  Be prepared for people stopping you to ask where you got your   Sublime STX gear....
Risks and Challenges
Since we are in production, there is no risk to you.  Your contribution will be a welcome augmentation to our existing business, and to expand.  With our fundraising target amount, we will be able to fulfill perk package orders promptly.
If your response exceeds our funding goal, perks will be produced and mailed out in the order received.  If delivery time is longer than expected, will we communicate with you and keep you up to date with production progress.
Other Ways You Can Help
If you are unable to contribute, we would be very appreciative of any help you give us making some noise about our campaign!  Indiegogo has some great sharing tools.  Help us blast social media!
Love your skin and look damn good doing it!
****Please note:  Sublime STX is not affiliated with St. Croix Nature Conservancy.  We are acting solely as a donor.

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Hi.  My name is Alejandra.  I am the founder of Monteverde Watches.  I am also a wife, mother and entrepreneur living in Costa Rica, a country in Central America that is small (only 51,100 square kms), peaceful (we have no army) and green (more than 25% of its land is protected forests and reserves and it has 4% of the total estimated species in the world!.)   </p>

<h3>Our Campaign</h3>
<p>As we mentioned before, the story of ""Lola"", our baby girl´s blue morpho, inspired us to design a watch that could be unisex, that could be worn in a casual or elegant way, and that could must certainly honor the beautiful fauna we have in our country and in the world.    A timepiece that will show you a new species every day and that will also be manufactured with high quality materials such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stainless Steel case and case back</li>
<li>Interchangeable straps so it can be worn with leather or stainless steel straps.</li>
<li>Sapphire glass</li>
<li>5 ATM water resistant. </li>
<li>Miyota Japanese movement.   EVERY DAY, YOU WILL SEE A NEW SPECIES ON YOUR DIAL.</li>
<li>All packed in a box that will simply make you say ""WOOW"" when you unpack your new watch, since you will be transported to the Cloud Forest of Monteverde, where our brand takes its name from.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our first collection, <strong>NATURA</strong>, will honor butterflies and beautiful, colorful and poisonous little frogs better know as Dart Frogs.  Everyday you will have a new one on your dial.   The watches will come in two different sizes:  38mm and 41mm.   They will also be available in silver and rose gold.   All of them with the options of leather strap (navy blue, black, dark brown, tan) or stainless steel mesh strap.</p>

<p><i>Every 24 hours, you will see on your dial a new species of either butterflies or dart frogs, depending on the watch you request.  </i></p>

It also helps parents track their baby’s health through monitoring their child’s behavior and sleeping patterns. Unlike other baby monitoring solutions out there, Lovey’s offers not only a baby sensor band to monitor the baby’s status and activity, but also includes a wristband for parents to receive alerts as they happen, a mobile app (for both iOS and Android) that helps parents set alerts for an industry-best range of variables, including skin temperature, breathing, body movement, sleeping position, and even room’s temperature and humidity level, and last but not least, Lovey’s bridge, a voice-activated device that keeps parents updated about their baby’s health, and it is considered the brain of our technology, as it processes the information received, to generate data and health tracking reports. On top of all that, there is no charging required with Lovey’s. Thanks to our innovative sensor and wireless technology package, Lovey’s lasts for a long period on a single simple coin battery that can be found at any nearby convenience store, pharmacy, or hardware retailer.Lovey’s help parents know their baby is healthy and happy, no matter where they are;  even when their child is with a family member or a trusted babysitter. Once parents purchase their Lovey’s package, they attach the sensor to their child’s ankle or wrist. Downloading the mobile application to their phone will allow parents to set the alert threshold levels and receiving alerts from baby’s sensor band. The parent puts on the wristband and synchronizes it with the baby sensor and with their phone. The parent can monitor their baby’s activity via the smartphone app, and then set alerts based on their concerns and needs.If any variable exceeds parameters set by the parents, or signals that the baby is in danger (such as high temperatures or rolling onto the stomach while sleeping), the parent will receive a notification on the parent smart phone and by voice via Lovey's Bridge. If the parent doesn't respond, the parent’s wristband will start notifying via beep sound. This alert can be dismissed by placing a hand over the wristband, which will be detected by a proximity sensor. If the parent still doesn’t respond to the parent’s wrist band alerts, Lovey’s will begin to make outgoing calls or SMS messages to a list of emergency contacts, letting them know that there is an issue and no one has responded, and those number will be saved during the initial setup of the App. Lovey's will record all the anomalies to generate reports that will help parents detect health problems, and take appropriate actions when its needed and in a timely manner. Lovey's Baby Bear is our soft, small band that connects to either the wrist or ankle, without restricting baby’s movement.  All of this capability is enabled by low-power, high-reliability Bluetooth Smart technology. All without having to worry about charging. Lovey's Linke, our soft, flexible, trendy and innovative band, allows parents to receive alerts about their baby’s condition, no matter where they are. Many of today’s young parents are attached to their smartphones, but many also don’t want to carry their phone with them from room to room, all the time. You can use the bracelet, use your smartphone, or chat with Lovey's voice-activated bridge to monitor your baby.If an alert condition arises, the wristband vibrates to notify the parent, and alerts can be dismissed by simply placing a hand over the wristband. A proximity sensor recognizes the gesture and turns the vibration off. Now that the parents know there’s is a potential issue, they can respond as needed. The Lovey's Bridge connects your child's vital signs to you in real time. The Bridge is a unique small box that hosts the machine learning & Artificial Intelligence for the Lovey's system. It connects information from the baby's band to an internet server DATA BASE  internet data base, our web site to set your baby's band.The range of the Lovey's Bridge is so great it can cover your whole house. It also has a digital microphone to detect a crying baby and uses a high quality speaker to translate your baby's event to human voice and notification.Some additional features include:
Notifies the parent, by voice, if the baby's band is off
Has speech recognition for parental commands (What is the baby's temperature? Set event temperature to 102°F. How long has the baby been sleeping? Stop monitoring.)

We are giving our backers the choice to vote for the perfect box design.What We Need & What You GetThe project is currently at a good stage with all the samples, prototypes, moulds, packaging and tooling already paid for. The manufacturing team has a clear idea of vision and quality the project team is striving for. So the project is at a really good position in terms of risk, and requires a minimum amount of funds to get it off the ground! The funds will be used to hit help hit the MOQ.Our goal with Rebella is to raise $2,000 so we can continue creating unique designs at an affordable price. Thank you for your support. Thank you for your belief in our creativity and passion. For $39, super early birds get a super gorgeous bracelet watch and a free gift- a smart watch/pedometer/sleep monitoring gadget ($80 value). Yes! It is the reward for being the first to support our vision and back our project. Thanks!Hurry as there are only 5 available.Smart Watch*- The smart watch in the perks is quipped with Bluetooth 4.0 and running Android 4.3 or later, and iOS7.0 or later. It has the following features:     Fitness Tracker: Tracks steps, distance, calories burned, progress towards set goals, etc Sleep Monitoring:From how long and how well to how deep or light the sleep was. Smart Alarm: Wakes you (and not your partner) with a silent alarm and triggers important reminders ( time to take pill, time to exercise,etc). Calculates the calories you burn throughout the daySyncs wirelessly and automatically with your devices (computer, smartphone, or tablet) so that you can view your custom dashboard online or while you moveComes with multiple device Language settings: English, Spanish, Deutsch, Russian, Hebrew and Chinese.*Reward brand may be different from the one indicated in the image aboveYou get one year warranty on any Rebella watch pre-ordered through indiegogo.The ImpactA part of the money from this project goes to Save the Children International (or a member organization). “Save the Children invests in childhood-every day, in times of crisis and for our future. Around the world, we give children a healthy start, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm. ”-Savethechildren.org
Risks & Challenges
Like all projects that take products from an idea to production there are risks, how-ever, I hope to have reduced these as the fundamentals of this project are already resolved with manufacturing already sourced from multiple manufacturers and quality confirmed - there should be no delivery delays or additional costs. I will be posting regular updates to keep everyone informed on the progress!

<p>Tuby is constructed from silicone. </p>
<p>Tuby’s raindrop
design allows for easy insertion and removal of your earphone as well as nice
0.1 mm gap between your earphones and the raindrop edge so your earphones won’t
be too constricted when inserted into Tuby. Also,
silicone was chosen to prevent tangling when putting your earphones into your

</div></div>","“ Dress up your earphones “Spruce up those everyday boring earphones to match your unique style.Tuby spruces up your everyday earphones in a variety of colors with its luminous (phosphorescent) styling allowing you make a statement about you. It’s tubular construction prevents those annoying tangles you get when you put your earphones in your pocket or bag. 












       Spruce up those everyday boring earphones to match your unique style.








Tuby wasn’t designed to simply dress up your earphones. When we put our earphones away into our pocket or bag, they tend to get tangled, which can lead to damage. We’ve all seen that before. When our earphones start to tear or fray, it’s because of the constant folding and bending that goes on.








Tuby’s phosphorescent construction also allows you to see them in the dark. Show off your fashion whether it’s day or night. 

Also, silicone was chosen to prevent tangling when putting your earphones into your pocket or bag. 



You can even use Tuby to wrap up your charge cables to be visible in the dark. This will also help prevent tearing or fraying as well and keep your cables like new. 





You can cut, tie, wind-up the 70 cm provided Tuby however you like. The lengths can cover the entire earphone, but can also be cut and mix and matched in a huge variety of colors to match your style.




Tuby is constructed from silicone. 
Tuby’s raindrop
design allows for easy insertion and removal of your earphone as well as nice
0.1 mm gap between your earphones and the raindrop edge so your earphones won’t
be too constricted when inserted into Tuby. Also,
silicone was chosen to prevent tangling when putting your earphones into your
pocket or bag. 







Choose your length to match your earphones.


Once you set the length, simply wrap up your earphones


With this simple, yet innovative design, make your earphones into a fashion item. 
Change up your Tuby style daily to match your mood. 
Mix and match colors to your liking and make a statement about you. 






Hi,

<br/><h3>Por qué una Escuela Virtual de Zapatería Artística?<br/>
</h3> <p><br/></p>
<p><b>Resumen</b>:</p>
<p>Hace 15 años me independizé del consumo del zapato desechable. Decidí construir una marca de Diseño que fuera Diferente, Original y Verdadera. <br/></p>
<p>Desarrollé un innovador proceso  asistido por computadora e inventé técnicas avanzadas de personalización artística. Uso materiales de primera calidad y tengo la habilidad de transformarlos en un calzado artístico liviano, confortable y duradero.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Origen de la Marca:</b></p>
<p>Zawate es un homónimo estilizado de la palabra costarricense 'Saguate o Zaguate' que significa ""perro callejero sin pedigrí"". Los perros callejeros, como ustedes saben, tienden a mezclarse entre ellos, y de cada combinación nacen diferentes variaciones al igual que nuestros zapatos: por eso son únicos, originales y diferentes. Baso mi trabajo en 3 ejes fundamentales: la Belleza, el Confort y la Calidad. </p>
<p>Cada uno de nuestros diseños equivalen en promedio a 12 pares de zapatos desechables. El tiempo de vida varía de 3 - 5 años dependiendo del cuido y mantenimiento.<br/></p>
<p>Como Artista Independiente aprendí desde joven a trabajar solo y con muy poco dinero. Con el tiempo adquirí experiencia y diseñé un sistema de trabajo que me permitió ahorrar e invertir, multiplicándo de esta manera mis recursos. Fundé un Studio de Arte Profesional y lancé mi marca a nivel nacional. Desde entonces he creado más de 1000 ejemplares.</p>Debido al creciente aumento en la demanda de mi producto, necesito abrir una Escuela Virtual de Zapatería Artística que me ayude a formar y capacitar nuevos colaboradores. El objetivo es generar nuevas fuentes de trabajo que me ayuden a satisfacer la demanda mundial del calzado artístico personalizado.<br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FY92AQFtsYPU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DY92AQFtsYPU&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FY92AQFtsYPU%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><br/>

Resumen:
Hace 15 años me independizé del consumo del zapato desechable. Decidí construir una marca de Diseño que fuera Diferente, Original y Verdadera. 
Desarrollé un innovador proceso  asistido por computadora e inventé técnicas avanzadas de personalización artística. Uso materiales de primera calidad y tengo la habilidad de transformarlos en un calzado artístico liviano, confortable y duradero.

Origen de la Marca:
Zawate es un homónimo estilizado de la palabra costarricense 'Saguate o Zaguate' que significa ""perro callejero sin pedigrí"". Los perros callejeros, como ustedes saben, tienden a mezclarse entre ellos, y de cada combinación nacen diferentes variaciones al igual que nuestros zapatos: por eso son únicos, originales y diferentes. Baso mi trabajo en 3 ejes fundamentales: la Belleza, el Confort y la Calidad. 
Cada uno de nuestros diseños equivalen en promedio a 12 pares de zapatos desechables. El tiempo de vida varía de 3 - 5 años dependiendo del cuido y mantenimiento.
Como Artista Independiente aprendí desde joven a trabajar solo y con muy poco dinero. Con el tiempo adquirí experiencia y diseñé un sistema de trabajo que me permitió ahorrar e invertir, multiplicándo de esta manera mis recursos. Fundé un Studio de Arte Profesional y lancé mi marca a nivel nacional. Desde entonces he creado más de 1000 ejemplares.Debido al creciente aumento en la demanda de mi producto, necesito abrir una Escuela Virtual de Zapatería Artística que me ayude a formar y capacitar nuevos colaboradores. El objetivo es generar nuevas fuentes de trabajo que me ayuden a satisfacer la demanda mundial del calzado artístico personalizado.
  Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes Necesitamos recolectar $9.000. 
Con este dinero cubriremos con los costos de producción de las recompensas y la producción general de la Escuela Virtual de Zapatería Artística.Puedes colaborar de dos maneras:1 º  Puedes aportar una pequeña contribución de $2, $5 y $10. Esto nos ayuda mucho a motivar a otras personas y nos permite acercarnos un poco más a la meta.2º Puedes adquirir alguno de nuestros diseños exclusivos - Edición Especial 15 Aniversario. De esta manera no solamente nos ayudas a financiar nuestra Escuela de Arte sino que además puedes adornar tus pies con estos, tus nuevos asombrosos Zawates PeRsoNaLiZaDoS de Lujo.$40 ZawaBolso Xpress (Puedes elegir el diseño de la Tela)

<h3>Cotton farmers across the world face severe problems. We at Believe Lifestyle have pledged to donate 2% of our profit out of every product we sell, helping to eradicate their problems to some extent.</h3>

</div></div>","Over the ages, we have never seen  Class getting out of style. We at believe lifestyle make sure that the products we make are intuitive. Unlike any other brand, we add value and style to our product.
Believe Lifestyle is a clothing startup that makes garments that are functional, sustainable and looks great at the same time.
The t-shirts and denim are engineered to make life easier and making the person who wears them look good every day.



The extra-long Supima fiber produces a yarn that's extremely soft and breathable. It is highly resistant to breaking, which makes it twice as strong as regular cotton.
 

 
Supima is inherently softer and more luxurious due to its extra-long staple fiber. The length of the fiber makes for a smoother surface and produces a softer fabric that resists pilling. This means that your products will feel sumptuously soft and only get softer as time passes.

Supima is twice as strong as regular cotton, which makes for extraordinarily resilient products. The longer fiber resists pilling, breaking and tearing resulting in fashion and home products that are incredibly resilient and keep their form for a longer-lasting product.

Silver interrupts the bacteria cell’s ability to form the chemical bonds essential to its survival. These bonds produce the cell’s physical structure so when bacteria meets silver it literally falls apart.  

 

 
Silver fabric is helpful for reducing antibacterial effects on clothing and fashion accessories.

Unlike some other metals with antimicrobial properties, Siver is not toxic to humans. Silver nanoparticles have been used to impart antimicrobial activity to cotton fibers.


 
Our product is the perfect combination of style and performance
We have collected data of more than 20000 male body sizes ensuring the perfect fit. T-shirts have been designed precisely to add style to your wardrobe. We have ensured that the t-shirts and denims don't lose their fit even after repeated use therefore adding durability to our product.



 
 T-shirts have been designed precisely to add style to your wardrobe.
 



 
Our t-shirts and Jeans don't lose their original fit even after rusty use.
Every Size is individually designed to achieve a great fit.
 

 
When looking for the best pair of jeans to buy, it is important to focus on the fit and quality. With regard to fit, we want to find something that is comfortable but not too loose, and most importantly, something we feel confident in. We have collected data from around 20000 people via online surveys and finally engineered our apparels for that perfect fit. Because what fits great looks great.

All cotton used in the production of Believe Jeans is 100% organic. 


Our Jeans will last as long as you are willing to take care of it. We mean, wear and wash with consideration, and mend it when required.




 

 
Conventional cotton production has a series of social and economic risks, especially for small farmers in developing countries.
 
Cotton is only grown on 2.5% of the world’s agricultural land, it consumes 16% of all the insecticides and 6,8% of all herbicides used worldwide. Many small farmers die due to a lack of adequate equipment and knowledge about how to handle pesticides properly.

  
 
Cotton farmers across the world face severe problems. We at Believe Lifestyle have pledged to donate 2% of our profit out of every product we sell, helping to eradicate their problems to some extent.

Essentially, its a kit with all the tools necessary to divide up cosmetics, which makes it easier to travel with. Why bring a full tube of foundation or your full-sized brushes when you don't have to?</p><p>I designed the Getaway makeup clutch because I wanted to keep a separate makeup bag for work or travel but couldn’t afford to buy 2 of everything!

<p>Since June of 2013, co-founders Alex and Steven have taken WristSpotter from concept to reality by working with CAD technicians and 3-D printing companies. With feedback from over 35 weightlifters, the team developed 20+ prototypes before landing on a final design. Now we need your help to make WristSpotter available for everyone.</p>
<p>Our strong ties with the bodybuilding, weightlifting, and physical therapy communities have given us extensive access to lifters and injured athletes who are all willing to support WristSpotter. Why? Because wrist injuries in these communities are so prevalent and can tragically prevent athletes from getting back on the bench.</p>
<p>This is where we need your help. In order to press forward with industrial production, WristSpotter requires startup funding. We need to pay for molds, materials, minimum orders on parts, strength testing, and shipping costs. This accounts for $30k, the smallest budget we believe is necessary to make WristSpotter a reality. Starting at $25 per unit, WristSpotter will be competitively priced with other wrist injury prevention devices on the market.</p>
<p>But that’s not all. We’re putting the project in the hands of the Indiegogo community because it is the best way to be directly in touch with the users of our product and build this together. If we reach our goal it’ll mean that there is a real need for WristSpotter and you’ll be the signal for that. Thanks in advance for your support.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Every new product project has risks and challenges…</p>
<p>Before starting this Indiegogo campaign, the WristSpotter team spent a large amount of TIME and MONEY on prior research, patents and intellectual property, prototypes, field testing, and start-up stage presentations and marketing to gyms and fitness professionals - all of that is the riskiest part of the project, and we felt that we needed to take that risk ourselves.</p>
<p>As we move towards production and manufacturing, our main challenges are quality assurance and quality control of the final design and integration, marketing, and parts deliveries.</p>
<p>We are confident in our design and the performance benefits that WristSpotter offers. To deliver a premium product, it is sometimes necessary to spend extra time fine-tuning drawing designs, refining processes, or adjusting key strength functioning tolerances.</p>
<p>We are working with testing firms and manufacturers who have years of experience in their respective areas to make sure the material capability and structural integrity of the design is comprehensive.</p>
<p>Testing new design tweaks and materials will sometimes incur longer lead times. We have excellent relationships with these companies and are coordinating closely with them almost every day to ensure that parts arrive ON TIME and with 100% QUALITY.</p>
<p>We are extremely determined to get your WristSpotter devices off the assembly line and onto your hands! However, you will be the first to know if we run into any unexpected delays or backups.</p>

<h3>Lon Chaney “Phantom Of The Opera” Bandanna.</h3>
<p>This campaign endeavors to fund a limited production of 22 inch by 22 inch bandannas with Lon Chaney, one of the greatest actors in cinema, as <i>The Phantom of the Opera</i>, his most famous role.<br/><br/>The width of <i>The Phantom's</i> face and eye distance matches the size of that of the average person's face.  When folded in half and worn it replaces the bottom half of one's countenance with Chaney's <i>Phantom of the Opera</i>.<br/><br/>Designed to be worn over a CDC face mask or other bandannas.  Or wear it as a neck gaiter, beanie, pirate rag, sweat band, head band, and more!<br/><br/>If funded, the one sided bandannas will be custom printed in the USA.  The fabric is the easier to clean, non-shrinking polyester and printed with dye sublimation technology, which uses heat to bond the image to the fabric.  The image and fabric stand up to multiple washings.<br/><br/>The proof sample arrived in December and has been worn in public and hand washed multiple times since.  The printing is high quality, durable and attracts attention.</p>

This campaign endeavors to fund a limited production of 22 inch by 22 inch bandannas with Lon Chaney, one of the greatest actors in cinema, as The Phantom of the Opera, his most famous role.The width of The Phantom's face and eye distance matches the size of that of the average person's face.  When folded in half and worn it replaces the bottom half of one's countenance with Chaney's Phantom of the Opera.Designed to be worn over a CDC face mask or other bandannas.  Or wear it as a neck gaiter, beanie, pirate rag, sweat band, head band, and more!If funded, the one sided bandannas will be custom printed in the USA.  The fabric is the easier to clean, non-shrinking polyester and printed with dye sublimation technology, which uses heat to bond the image to the fabric.  The image and fabric stand up to multiple washings.The proof sample arrived in December and has been worn in public and hand washed multiple times since.  The printing is high quality, durable and attracts attention.
The Campaign
My name is Darren Nemeth and I've run a number of successful crowdfunders.
How To Film Moving Pictures in the 1910's, a book which was funded on Kickstarter successfully in early 2018.
1907 Chicago Projecting Co.'s Entertainer's Supplies Catalog No. 122; Deluxe Edition printed in 2015.
The Great Express Robbery, a reprint of the 1907 pulp novel funded through Kickstarter in June, 2019.

""Fritz To The Front"" (1881) and ""Dick Turpin"" (1904) a crime novel (with movie legend Lon Chaney on the cover!) and a British reader in it's original comic book sized format.  Funded at Kickstarter on April 27, 2020.RANSOM! The Story of a Lost Child; Intimate Chapters of a Film Star's Life volume one of a lost pulp trash odyssey. Partially funded here at Indiegogo in November 2020.

Funding
The backing goal covers all production costs for the proofs, the limited custom print run, Indigogo's fee and payment processing fee, taxes, shipping materials, and UPS shipping from Printology's facility on the west coast.  The number of bandannas produced depends on the amount of funds raised.  The minimum goal we hope for is 100.

Risks & ChallengesLow risk.  The proofs are in my hands and if funded Printology, the Californian company charged with producing this limited run, is ready to go.  All perks will ship in April if funded.

Sounds too good to be true? ""Cowhide - Really?"" It’s true - it’s real cowhide however you look at it.It’s the price that has made everyone baffled and suspicious. We’ve had customers buy our briefcases, chop them up and test them to see if we were lying, and then come back for repeat purchases. We’d hate to see any more of our bags go to waste like that, so we thought we might show you some cold, hard facts. All our leather has been certified genuine through KC certification by FITI Testing and Research Institute, even before the Electrical Appliances and Consumer Products Safety Control Act amendment made such certification necessary. But aren't cow leather briefcases supposed to be extravagant, price-wise? That’s true. Other cowhide briefcases out in the market cost anywhere between US$200 and US$3000. Sure, they use premium materials, but their prices drive most potential customers away.● There are numerous uses for briefcases: college students need a way to carry around their laptops and books without making their back sweat.● People just getting started at their first jobs want to look professional.● Businessmen who have frequent meetings outside the office need a bag to carry around their personal belongings.But most people can’t afford the higher-end briefcases on the market, and the more affordable alternatives tend to wear out quickly... “Why can’t a cowhide briefcase be reasonably priced?” Enter nTRES!Extravagant quality without the exorbitant prices.By this point, you’re asking yourself, “Why and how are these prices possible?”The secret to providing a genuine leather product at this price point is all in the production and distribution process.More than 14 years of know-how has allowed us to establish a production environment and designs optimized for large-scale manufacturing. This has helped to drastically reduce product costs. The scale of production - whether we produce 10 bags or 100 bags in a day - is a major determinant of product cost.In addition, we place mass orders for the materials we use, allowing us to negotiate down prices further. Our products are released in containers, allowing for savings in logistics costs. We don’t advertise unnecessarily, and employ smart sales strategy to reduce distribution margin. All of that adds up to our startlingly low prices.Of course, more important point is our sales strategy! We make less money per unit sold, but sell many units to make up for the small profits. If you thought we would sideline quality for the sake of volume, then you would be wrong. At nTRES, we're finicky about quality. Our goods are produced under strict supervision and management. ☺Indiegogo is the perfect platform for harnessing our capabilities and strengths. We bet you’re still thinking 'these prices are too good to be true?!'. Well, you can keep thinking that. Because we will present you with better products at lower prices. Keep your eye on us. “Surprised by our prices? It's too early to be surprised.
 Wait till you see our product.”  Let’s explore nTRES briefcases in more detail!Search online and offline, and you'll find hundreds, even thousands of cowhide briefcases. Most of the established brands have cowhide briefcases as their products. You’d be spoilt for choice, if only the prices weren't so crazy. Forking over so much money for a briefcase, you'll go with a design you won’t get tired of easily, and colors that match with most of the clothes you own. Ultimately, most of us end up with a dull black or brown bag. And the things are so darned heavy, too! Put your laptop and documents inside, and your briefcase becomes a burden not only on your wallet but on your shoulder as well.Our clothes get lighter in the summer. Our bags should do the same.You’re lugging around your laptop in the heat of summer, and you can’t bear to stay outside without a cold beverage in your hand. Nothing like a hefty briefcase to weigh you down and make your day even more miserable. nTRES briefcases are made with durable and lightweight materials to reduce weight, making them drastically lighter than any other cowhide briefcases on the market. Period. With our briefcases, the only thing weighing you down in the summer will be the heat. nTRES briefcase in one hand, and your favorite cold beverage in the other, and you’re good to go. So light for a cowhide briefcase! The strap makes a huge difference too.The strap is what connects your briefcase to your body. Normally, straps are made with nylon - but nTRES straps aren’t. Our straps are lined with leather strips on the outside, giving them a more luxurious look while also allowing for easy length adjustment without slippage. We’ve also added a leather shoulder pad for comfortable wearing and less shoulder fatigue. What you get :Briefcase● With separated laptop pouch● Smart inner pockets for your smartphone, pens, and keys Clutch● Smart inner pockets for your smartphone, pens, car keys etc If you like carrying around your wallet, fine. But you really won’t need to. Take a look at the photo below!  You know how things never seem to stay where you put them?You can never find anything when you need it.Spacious mobile phone pocket in which iPhone 11 Pro Max fits nTRES briefcases feature smart, compartmentalized storage spaces for neat and systematic organization of your items. The detachable laptop case is the perfect size for storing documents as well.Let's store our items securely.Slots for your cards, a pocket for your smartphone, and holders for those pens that keep disappearing in your bag. All that, and a holder for the car keys you keep misplacing. A large zipper pocket is also provided for safekeeping of valuables.Say goodbye to those days when you had to practically empty out your bag to find anything! “We respect everybody’s tastes.” Seven colors to satisfy all tastes. nTRES briefcases come in seven different colors. No one-color-fits-all nonsense with us.Choose the color that works best with you. Mustard? Orange? Conservative? We also have a basic black version.* The image with the name of the color best represents the actual color.* The photographs may differ in color from the actual product depending on the user’s monitor specs and brightness.  “They look good on anyone.” The secret is in the details. Conventional briefcases, with their sharp square corners, only pair well with formal attire. nTRES briefcases are intended to be formal yet casual at the same time, in order to match various styles. The design emphasis was placed on preserving the soft and smooth look of natural cowhide, while also giving our briefcases a proper posture. The handles are designed to fit snugly in the palm and reduce fatigue, and a handle strap has been added to keep the handles from dangling when wearing the briefcase over your shoulder using the strap. A black nickel ornament has been added for extra   flair. The zipper pocket on the back of the bag is perfect for holding frequently used items. A bag is only as good as its zippers. Nobody appreciates a broken zipper. nTRES bags use high-quality YKK zippers exclusively for more pleasant user experience. YKK Zipper detail Furthermore, our briefcases are equipped with double zippers for much easier use.  Smooth opening and closing of zippers And about our clutches,The high quality of our briefcases carries over into our clutches. They come in all seven colors too! Our clutches have also been made out of natural cowhide, and boast their compartments for smart storage. Don’t let the size fool you - you can fit more in there than you think! Large enough to comfortably fit your iPad, our clutches - like our briefcases - come with smart pockets and compartments for storage. Complete your style with our clutches - and leave everything else at home.Cards, mobile phones, pens, car keys (or AirPods) can be neatly organized in the clutch.iPad Pro fits perfectly in the clutch.A standard size book fits in as well! Card Wallets* Reminder : You will receive more benefit if you make a contribution to a SET.Just like the briefcases and clutches, our card wallets are natural cowhide products. They also come in 7 colors. Card Wallet 001This is our basic type card wallet. It includes 2 card slots and a pocket in the middle where such items like coins can be stored. Card Wallet 001 - Orange Card Wallet 002You can use this card wallet type by hanging it on your bag. Have you ever thought it’s inconvenient to take your frequently used transportation card in and out of the bag all the time? Now hang them on the bag for convenient use!  Card Wallet 002 - OrangeCard Wallet 002 - Orange Match any style!From casual to formal, our bags are a perfect match for your daily style! Briefcase - Black Briefcase - Navy, Briefcase - Orange Briefcase - Green, Clutch - Green Clutch - Brown Briefcase - Orange, Clutch - Orange Clutch - Green Briefcase - Navy, Briefcase - Orange Briefcase - Mustard Briefcase - Green Briefcase - Grey, Briefcase - Mustard Briefcase - Brown How they’re made :One-stop production from planning to design, production, and release!!Our team has been working together for more than 14 years. Given a simple sketch, they can produce exactly the samples you want on the spot. We try out the samples, fix what needs fixing and add various functions. If the end result works, then we move onto production. While factories today are highly automated, bags are still a product that requires a large amount of manual labor.Each member of our team takes responsibility for the part for which they are most skilled, and the individually crafted parts come together to complete the finished product. Perfection in the individual parts is essential. And that’s how we make our natural cowhide briefcases in the US$60 range.  Materials & Sizes Upper : 100% cowhideLining : Synthetic leather  Briefcase-Laptop pouch * fits up to 15-inch MacBook Pro    * Some models may not fit; pouches may stretch with use due to the material’s properties. Clutch * Fits up to 10.5-inch new-generation iPad Perks :This is a rare chance to get natural cowhide briefcases and clutches at these prices.We have prepared various combinations so that you can have the experience on your own, as well as with your friends and colleagues.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>1. Delivery time: In manufacturing, there's always a risk that the component suppliers do not deliver on time. There's also the risk that issues may occur during manufacturing. So, we've added some buffer into our production and delivery timeline to account for this possibility. We will be extremely hands-on with our suppliers to ensure that everything is moving forward smoothly.</p>
<p>2. Customs: Some countries are known for being very slow with customs. So please bear with us while your shipment clears the customs process.</p>
<p>3. Duty/VAT charges: If you live outside of the UK, you may incur duty or VAT charges. As per usual, you will be responsible for any applicable charges.</p>
<p>We'll update you frequently about our progress, and if any issues occur along the way, we'll keep you informed!</p>

We’re two friends, Abdullah Ahmed and Harun Asif, based in London, and we started Miraj Collections in 2018. 
We conceived the idea for Miraj through our travels across the world, our common passion for design and a deep appreciation of the Islamic artistic tradition and cultural heritage.
We want to share this timeless tradition through watches and accessories, so it can be appreciated by everyone, every day. 
This is our first crowdfunding campaign. We are very excited and hope we can offer more fantastic pieces in the near future. We can't thank you all enough for your support!

 
Risks & Challenges
1. Delivery time: In manufacturing, there's always a risk that the component suppliers do not deliver on time. There's also the risk that issues may occur during manufacturing. So, we've added some buffer into our production and delivery timeline to account for this possibility. We will be extremely hands-on with our suppliers to ensure that everything is moving forward smoothly.
2. Customs: Some countries are known for being very slow with customs. So please bear with us while your shipment clears the customs process.
3. Duty/VAT charges: If you live outside of the UK, you may incur duty or VAT charges. As per usual, you will be responsible for any applicable charges.
We'll update you frequently about our progress, and if any issues occur along the way, we'll keep you informed!",19.0,1,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","What do you know of the people who made your watch?  The men and women who designed it. The artisans who made it. Their inspirations. Their stories?  Tempus Faire are here to change that!  For years, watch enthusiasts have had to pay thousands of pounds for beautiful designer watches, not realizing that these timepieces can directly be bought from world-renowned artisans at a fraction of the cost.Tempus Faire strived to build a network of artisans and watch masters who will create exclusive timepieces, minus the unnecessary markup. We don't hide masterminds behind their craft. At Tempus Faire, we put the artists front and center so you can listen to their stories, one wristpiece at a time. Meet the creator: Clement Sinibaldi, a master craftsman who has created some of the most coveted watches on the market sold by brands like Fabergé, Garmin, and Audemars Piguet. The French designer is well-known for his eye for the modern and the mechanical. Together, we are happy to introduce our first collection inspired by the 21st-century gentleman: the Comrade collection.Every single component of your Tempus Faire watch is sourced, manufactured, designed, and assembled carefully and precisely to give you the perfect product.Watch straps are sourced directly from the finest leather tanneries in Italy. We selected the best combination of colour and texture so you can enjoy a comfortable and beautiful wrist piece.Tempus Faire watches are made from surgical grade steel offering durability and luxury that will only look better throughout the years.Nothing has been forgotten, the hands are coated with premium swiss lume so that you can read time in the dark.  

 The spirit of the modern man is embodied by our very first exclusive collection, the Comrade. Sleek, sophisticated, and suave, the Comrade is designed for the man who has it all - but deserves a little more.In celebration of the 21st-century man, we're limiting production to 2,100 beautiful watches per style. Our collection features two styles: 

 A dual-time watch that displays the date and allows for two time zones for gentlemen who are on the go.

 A skeleton style watch made for rightful watch enthusiasts who appreciate the art of watchmaking. Featuring a complex Japanese automatic movement mechanism that will wow anyone.A gift, from us to you.  All Tempus Faire purchases come with a stylish leather gift box, making it the perfect gift for yourself and others.

<p></p><p><i>We use 100% vegetable tanned full grain leather
to make our products. We work with tannery in Italy who has more 50 years of
experience and a UK tannery which has been producing vegetable tanned leather
for nearly 2 centuries. These are a few remaining tanneries in the world producing vegetable tanned leather.</i></p>
<p><i>Vegetable tanned leather has a beautiful smell to
it that develops a rich patina with use &amp; time. We use only 1.8 mm-2 mm thick
leather thereby enabling the product to last a lifetime</i>.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><u><b><i>ENGLISH BRIDLE LEATHER</i></b></u><b><i></i></b></p>
<p></p><p><i>Bridle Leather refers to the way that a piece
of leather (cow hide) is finished at the tannery. Bridle leather has both the
Flesh and Grain side of the leather stuffed with greases and finished with wax.
This is generally a labour intensive process, thus expensive! Only the best
grades of leather are treated like this, it would be uneconomic to treat poor
quality leather in this way. There are only a few tanneries producing good
bridle leather.</i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><u><b><i>ITALIAN LEATHER</i></b></u></p>
<p></p><p><i>Italian leather is often considered to be the
best kind of leather in the world. Many designer brands use Italian leather to
make high end products. Leather from Italy is traditionally known for the
quality of its craftsmanship. It is ""full grain"" leather,
which is made from the very best raw hides. As it ages,</i><i>it
gains a beautiful sheen. Most of this leather is of high
quality, and stay in beautiful condition much longer than other types of
leather. </i></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439546671/kpclhzfz1fkptbfbzina.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439568173/wee80y1eaylhofqsst4k.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439306426/zc7c4j7jrevhvvwlnmwf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438797451/awkzfqosrzkrztcuecyx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438797484/lohr5lbqyn5ljcilj0ur.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438862139/d5eaf2qhmvhfjpdmi0ql.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440297029/t09o1a6mvzf4bybozuan.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440297869/yuetnolox0rw150mfuzk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440297938/ngbszdvuobjgga0qpp4t.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 36px; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 40px; background-color: initial;""><i>                                                                                 <u>PERKS</u></i></b><br/></p><div>

All in all I am extremely happy with the
experience. Big thumbs up to the Azzuraa team”
                                                                                    Victor Calanog, New York, USA

“I received the bag last week and have been
using it extensively. It has turned out just as I had expected it and I am very
happy with it. I was also very pleased with the quick turnaround time”
                                                                                          Joshua Barza, Boston, USA


“The belts are very well made. I would recommend

                                                                                  Craig Courtie, Victoria, Australia

“The bag is very well made,
sturdy. I like the canvas a lot. Overall, good value”
                                                                             Milosz Skrzypczak, Ontario, Canada
“The bag has arrived
and looks great. Many thanks”
                                                                                           David Monger, London, UK                                                                                   ABOUT
AZZURAA “az-zur-aa”:

RAW
MATERIALS


We
use full grain, vegetable tanned leather from Italy, English Bridle leather
from UK and 100% Cotton Canvas from Europe.
 100% Cotton fabric lining, Premium brass YKK
zippers, Polyester thread from Gutermann & Solid Brass accessories.


WORKMANSHIP


We
have our own small unit where each product is individually hand-crafted by
giving maximum attention to detail and thus making a high quality product and
providing decades of use.
FAIR
PRICES
We
wish to grow on customer feedback. Our only source of marketing is mouth
publicity. Thereby cutting down the marketing and other overhead expenses, we bring
to you the products at fair prices when compared with other luxury RTW brands
and bespoke makers.



DESIGN

After
a thorough study and market research, we have come up with a few minimalistic
designs.  You also have
the option to create your own design and we take care of you. 
CREATING
YOUR OWN DESIGN

Liked
the color of a bag, but not the design? Liked the structure but thought a
little big/small, a couple of internal pockets would fit my needs. Liked a
designer RTW bag, but it’s too expensive.
At
Azzuraa, you have the liberty to select from our wide range of options or create your own design that meets your needs at no extra cost.VEGETABLE TANNED LEATHER 
We use 100% vegetable tanned full grain leather
to make our products. We work with tannery in Italy who has more 50 years of
experience and a UK tannery which has been producing vegetable tanned leather
for nearly 2 centuries. These are a few remaining tanneries in the world producing vegetable tanned leather.
Vegetable tanned leather has a beautiful smell to
it that develops a rich patina with use & time. We use only 1.8 mm-2 mm thick
leather thereby enabling the product to last a lifetime.ENGLISH BRIDLE LEATHER
Bridle Leather refers to the way that a piece
of leather (cow hide) is finished at the tannery. Bridle leather has both the
Flesh and Grain side of the leather stuffed with greases and finished with wax.
This is generally a labour intensive process, thus expensive! Only the best
grades of leather are treated like this, it would be uneconomic to treat poor
quality leather in this way. There are only a few tanneries producing good
bridle leather.ITALIAN LEATHER
Italian leather is often considered to be the
best kind of leather in the world. Many designer brands use Italian leather to
make high end products. Leather from Italy is traditionally known for the
quality of its craftsmanship. It is ""full grain"" leather,
which is made from the very best raw hides. As it ages,it
gains a beautiful sheen. Most of this leather is of high
quality, and stay in beautiful condition much longer than other types of
leather.                                                                                  PERKS

Our
Story

Hi
we are Nikhil, Neha and Megha, creators of Azzuraa.
Whenever
we were out in the market shopping for a decent leather bag either for ourselves or gifts for loved
ones, we always were at a loss. We could not find one below
$1000. Also the ones available in the market always left something unanswered. We
were introduced to the world of endless possibilities in the form of bespoke
services. 
After
a bit of research, we found out that we could easily source the best quality
raw materials which are at par with the ones used by luxury brands, but at
highly reasonable prices. We then thought of starting our own online bespoke
services for luxury leather goods. And by directly selling them online to you,
we see to it that they do not burn a hole in your pocket.
We
have been working on this concept for the past few years and have our suppliers
in place. We have set up our own production unit with highly skilled team of
experts.
We
now need your support & co-operation to make this dream into a reality and
help us all have our dream bag in our hands at very affordable prices. Straight from the factory, directly in your hands. No mark up, no middle man, no retailing, no whole-selling, no placing of the products in flimsy lights in malls or stores to push up the prices. Do help
in spreading our word out there.

</div>
<p><b>GAME</b> is
the absolute favorite toy of our hyper-active dogs, such as beagles, border collies etc. Our
test-dogs have had it for months and have completely fallen in love with it. It
was our hope that they would, at least, break less of their owners household
items, but when the owners came back and told us, that <b>nothing</b> had been broken or chewed up since they got <b>GAME</b>, we knew,
we were on to something good! </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>The
Velcro, the floppy ends and that they have to move the toy around and around, is
just what these dogs have been craving all along! </b></p>
<p>With
the toy being in soft materials, your dog doesn't have to hold back strength
when it grabs, pulls and tucks its way into the treats. Game is a real
brain-teaser as the way into the pockets is different - each time, there is a new way in! Just getting the toy opened so it lies
flat out is a challenge, where your dog gets to use its intelligence and
physique to solve the puzzle. </p>
<p>Therefore, we recommend that you start out by given your dog <b>GAME </b>in an open state - then you can step up the difficulty later! </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>     <b>Color choices coming soon! </b></p>

</div></div>","Dogs of the World have been Barking out for This! 

                 Let your dog be challenged while you're away from home!             



Leaving your dog at home while heading off to work has always been accompanied by a guilty conscience of knowing how bored your best friend is
going to be, while you’re gone all day. Maybe even bored enough to take it out
on your new shoes or  couch? 





We're introducing Pet-Pocket® as the new brainteaser for your dog
to enjoy, while you’re busy elsewhere!

The Dog Education Program











Dogs love having to work for their food - it stems from the time when they had to dig into the forest floor for food and use their brains to get fed. Activating your dog's problem-solving skills develops their intelligence and improves their self-confidence in the process. The best dog activity toys are usually the ones, that needs you as a counterpart; to throw the Frisbee, hold the sock back and so forth. But busy lives doesn't always allow time for such efforts to the extent you and your best buddy may wish for...
                           What makes Pet-Pocket® different is how much fun                                     your dog can have with our toys on it's own!

Our patent pending designs have the advantages of intriguing, while tiring your dog out with mental and physical exercise. The complexity, sturdiness and game-changing paw-closing function in the toys makes for hour-long playtime for your dog - and something fun for you to watch! Our products have been thoroughly tested and are produced with the safest and most durable phthalate-free materials and super-strong seams for continuous usage. When it becomes a bit too sticky - Rinse it out with ease!
 


Don't be surprised, when your dog carries the toy back to you and 'asks' you to ""Please refill"" - It's a great way of dividing feedings and it's really cute too!

Pet-Pocket® Products


LETTER




                   Many dogs greatly enjoy the arrival of the postman                     and who ever said mail should only be for people?






Now you can wish dog-loving friends and family 'Happy Holidays' and surprise a friend's dog with a Pet-Pocket® LETTER, that not only contains your yummy treats inside a permanent dog toy, but also a message for either the dog or your loved-ones. It also works as an add-on for some of our up-coming products! LETTER is opened by the dog pulling on the snip and then it's play-time! 

   

                               The Pet-Pocket® LETTER is a permanent toy                                       - with a permanent message! 



                  This way every time your friend refills the Pet-Pocket® LETTER                      - they'll think of you! 
 
         Besides the Red color, that's perfect for Christmas, Pet-Pocket® LETTER             will also later be available in 

                                   
Cyclamen                             Raphia                                 Céladon




TRY
Developing fine motor-skills!








TRY is one of our core introduction products, where you can make the toy more difficult as your dog gets faster at getting the treats out. When the dog gets the treat too fast, simply cut off one end of the toy to make it harder for the dog!

TRY is available in the following colors

     




                Cyclamen               Raphia                  Céladon                  Bleuet




LEARN 
Our all-purpose favorite!





LEARN is also our personal
favorite as its just as functional as it is stylish! 
It's is perfect to bring to the park or when your dog just needs to be activated for an hour or so. The product is so soft that your dog bonds with it, just like a teddy bear. Due to the treats inside, dogs show an impressive eagerness to have the product close and loves sleeping next to their new toy.


LEARN is available in colors: Army, Raphia (Beige) and Cyclamen(Pink)



GAME 
The Rubik's Cube for dogs! 




GAME is
the absolute favorite toy of our hyper-active dogs, such as beagles, border collies etc. Our
test-dogs have had it for months and have completely fallen in love with it. It
was our hope that they would, at least, break less of their owners household
items, but when the owners came back and told us, that nothing had been broken or chewed up since they got GAME, we knew,
we were on to something good! 
The
Velcro, the floppy ends and that they have to move the toy around and around, is
just what these dogs have been craving all along! 
With
the toy being in soft materials, your dog doesn't have to hold back strength
when it grabs, pulls and tucks its way into the treats. Game is a real
brain-teaser as the way into the pockets is different - each time, there is a new way in! Just getting the toy opened so it lies
flat out is a challenge, where your dog gets to use its intelligence and
physique to solve the puzzle. 
Therefore, we recommend that you start out by given your dog GAME in an open state - then you can step up the difficulty later! 

     Color choices coming soon!

Vision

Through openness and honesty, we set out to create a better quality of life for both dogs and owners.
Our goals are simple; we intend to provide dogs the opportunity to learn and develop their skill-set.
We strongly believe, that a learning dog is a happy dog!



Ready for production



We have +30 prototypes at different levels of completion and 4 products ready to go into production. Our manufacturer has supplied us with great samples of our designs and the factory is ready to commence production at any time. 


We have joined forces with companies in other industries, which acquire same materials in their production for much larger products. In collaboration, we have found a way of combining our manufacturing, so Pet-Pocket® uses the absolute best and most durable materials at an affordable cost - and it keeps the environment clean simultaneously! 








The Indiegogo Campaign


Here’s where you come in!
We have tested our prototypes and perfected them, We have sought out only the safest materials and most sustainable production methods to find our perfect match. We are now at a stage where Field Testing is behind us and our basic product portfolio is in place. 
If you support us by proving demand, we promise to market at least  10 new products within a year! 
We're now raising $30.000, which will allow us to produce Pet-Pocket® at a large enough scale to be able to offer it affordable to everyone. 
In return for your early support, you'll be among the first to get the Pet-Pocket® products, get some pretty great perks at a discounted price and support a company trying to redefine the dog toy market and quality of life for dogs!
* We expect to fulfill our crowdfunding orders by November 2015 - January 2016. The packages only including LETTER are the highest of our priorities and will be sent out in the middle of November. We do not expect any delays, but promise to update backers with the exciting steps as we proceed. 



 

Meet the Pet-Pocket® Team
Frank is the crazy inventor, Mark is our designated critic, John makes sure we don't spend too much, Martin makes all of our tech stuff work, Kasia brings great ideas to the table and Helle makes all the ends meet! 




But the most important team-members are our awesome test-dogs!


If Buster, Shaggy, Timber, Ashton, Zeus, Tejs, Ronja, Covo and Bobby love it, we'll bet your dog will too!


Risk & Challenges
If we meet our goal, we feel sure we can deliver on the promised perks. Our next goal is to give every dog-owner on the planet the chance to improve the quality of life for their dog. We hope, that you will help spread the word, so that not only your dog, but many others will get to enjoy this new playmate!

Q&A:

Q: Do the Pet-Pocket® products require a specific level of intelligence from the dog?


No, all dogs can benefit and develop mentally from our product! But, remember that your dog needs time and a little help to understand it in the beginning. Please read our 'How it works' section on our website 


Q: How do you know that this toy can be interesting for all dogs?
We have done extensive testing on dogs of varying species and sizes, from chihuahua to husky. All of them have shown great interest in the products.


Q: Is there a difference between the dog playing with the Pet-pocket while its observed and while it is alone?
Yes. When the dog is home alone, it will spend more time with the toy as it knows that it won't be refilled until you get home and do it, so it wants to make sure it gets all the treats. 

Q: What makes Pet-Pocket® different? 
The Pet-Pocket® products are designed to engage the dog in a game it finds natural. The fact that it is part of its instincts, engages the dog further than just getting the treat. Dogs enjoy using their natural senses and problem-solving skills. 
 
This doesn't just give your dog a happier life - you'll get happier from seeing your dog happy! ;-) 

Q: If Pet-Pocket® gets the funding, am I sure that you can deliver? 


Yes, our manufacturing facility is ready to produce and we are now finalizing our freight arrangements! The interest in the Pet-Pocket® products have been overwhelming and we feel confident in our business model and we can't wait to be able to offer this to every dog-owner! 

Q: How do I clean the product? 
Simply rinse out the product as described in the instruction pamphlet that follows every product. 

 Q: Are shipping fees included in the prices?

No, shipping fees are not included. International backers will be responsible for applicable tariffs and customs fees. But we're are working hard at getting our products into the States and if we reach our expected volume, we'll ship directly from the U.S to your house 

Q: Can I count on the Christmas Package arriving in time for me to send it to a loved one? 
The factory is ready, the materials are in place and as soon as we see real activity here, we'll bet it all and start production! 

Of course, we are mere humans and cannot foresee the future, but we have taken every necessary step to get the job done in time. 



Q: What happens if my dog manages to tear a hole in the toy?

No worries, a hole or two in the material doesn't make a difference. The materials         are super safe for your dog to lick, chew and hug as much as the dog wants to. The inside lining of all of our products are designed to not allow knives to cut through and several of our products are also available in Beavers Nylon (army color) for the real hard-hitters of dogs. For the real 'biters', we recommend GAME  and LEARN in army color.


Please read our materials references on our website!

 
Q: How durable are the Pet-Pocket® toys?

We've done extensive testing with positive feedback. Our materials are among the strongest within soft material, but just as all other dog toys; some manages to tear it up. Our products are lined with the same materials, used for protecting people when they cut with sharp knives in the food-industry. The products in army-color is of Beavers Nylon, that's known for it's sturdiness and increased strength. How you introduce the toy to your dog is key and done right, your dog will have a pal for life.

We also have a great relationship with a top quality manufacturing partner that maintains our high quality standards.The Belt Organizer is Patent Pending.We remind all who support this campaign that Indiegogo is not a store, but rather a place to invest in the development and execution of new ideas.Thank you for supporting ELYPRO™ and for being a part of bringing this product to life!Get in TouchThanks for taking the time to check us out!
