<h3>Hello everyone, my name is Maria and I'm the co-founder of BabooDeals.</h3>
<h3>BabooDeals is pretty awesome! We sell consumer goods at up to 90% OFF the retail price. Saving people TONS of money! We buy back all unwanted merchandise: such as customer returns, overstock and shelf pulls from some of the largest retailers in North America. In doing so, we help eliminate massive landfills and toxins that can cause cancerous effects. Since our launch BabooDeals has helped the environment by creating a secondary market for unwanted merchandise. Not only does this help our environment but also some people in need.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Help us protect our environment by re-using, reducing and recycling used consumer goods.</strong></p>

<p>Did you know that all your returned goods, or overstock merchandise could all end up in a landfill somewhere? After it ends up in landfill the next thing to happen sadly is seep into our drinking water.</p>
<p>At BabooDeals we make sure that this doesn't happen.</p>
<p>Why invest in our cause and business?</p>
<ul>
<li>We put unwanted used/overstock consumer goods into the hands of someone that needs them</li>
<li>We protect our environment, and our children’s future</li>
<li>We reduce waste, encourage recycling, and help animals live longer</li>
</ul><p>Imagine all the customer returns at your local Wal-Mart, what about Target or  Home Depot? The list goes on.. Now imagine in your entire State or Province.. How about nationwide?  This results in millions of metric tons of waste every year that can be reused, recycled, remanufactured, refurbished and resold to someone.</p>
<h2><strong><br/></strong></h2>
<h2><strong>WHAT CAN YOU DO FOR US AND WHAT DO YOU GET IN RETURN?</strong></h2>
<p>We need at least $25,000 or more to buy more of these unwanted products. We will expand and grow our cause/business and also increase our purchasing power. By buying in large volumes we keep our prices low for resale.</p>
<p>Most of the money will be used to fund more purchases from these retailers. Once we purchase this stock we will store it at our facility - NOT a landfill, and begin re-distribution.</p>
<p>By investing in us = you help our world be a greener place while getting some cool perks along with your contribution. Every contribution helps! As little as $2.00 or up to $2500.00 we can all help each other!</p>

<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<h3>This project will allow us to minimize landfills, buy products at lower costs and offer them at lower prices. Just imagine the changes we can make!</h3>

<p>Without
proper allocation of funding to research Cannabis’ uses and side effects, the
plant will continue to hold the same social and legal stigmas as heroin and cocaine.  This is more based on the limited capability
for taxation and regulation than any inherent pitfalls of Cannabis use.  The benefits of medicinal Cannabis—which has
been shown to positively affect patients suffering from cancer, dementia,
diabetes, epilepsy, glaucoma, and Tourette syndrome—will never be fully explored.<span> We also feel that Cannabis, as a
plant, should be treated as such and that a private citizen should be able to
grow and possess this plant within reasonable amounts the same as one grows and
possesses herbs like ginseng or lavender.</span></p>
<p><b>How?</b></p>
<p>The
Plant A Seed Tour is an effort to offset the challenges brought about by
Cannabis’ unlawful classification.  It
is the story of William ""Palito Blanco"" Mueller, along with Ken, Shirley, and Dakota of the Locke family, cyclists who are passionate about raising
awareness for medicinal and therapeutic Cannabis use, as they embark on a
grueling 4,200 mile journey across the U.S. from St. Augustine, Florida to San Fransisco, California, and later across the entire country of Uruguay.  The tour’s purpose is to raise money that
will go directly towards Cannabis research, education, and awareness in the U.S., as well as around the globe.  You can follow the tour in the
various YouTube videos, which will be posted in a video journal as they complete the tour, and you can follow the journey on his blog (<a href=""http://www.plantaseed.community/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.plantaseed.community</a>).

<p></p><br/></div>","Why?
Without
proper allocation of funding to research Cannabis’ uses and side effects, the
plant will continue to hold the same social and legal stigmas as heroin and cocaine.  This is more based on the limited capability
for taxation and regulation than any inherent pitfalls of Cannabis use.  The benefits of medicinal Cannabis—which has
been shown to positively affect patients suffering from cancer, dementia,
diabetes, epilepsy, glaucoma, and Tourette syndrome—will never be fully explored. We also feel that Cannabis, as a
plant, should be treated as such and that a private citizen should be able to
grow and possess this plant within reasonable amounts the same as one grows and
possesses herbs like ginseng or lavender.
How?
The
Plant A Seed Tour is an effort to offset the challenges brought about by
Cannabis’ unlawful classification.  It
is the story of William ""Palito Blanco"" Mueller, along with Ken, Shirley, and Dakota of the Locke family, cyclists who are passionate about raising
awareness for medicinal and therapeutic Cannabis use, as they embark on a
grueling 4,200 mile journey across the U.S. from St. Augustine, Florida to San Fransisco, California, and later across the entire country of Uruguay.  The tour’s purpose is to raise money that
will go directly towards Cannabis research, education, and awareness in the U.S., as well as around the globe.  You can follow the tour in the
various YouTube videos, which will be posted in a video journal as they complete the tour, and you can follow the journey on his blog (www.plantaseed.community). 
 The Route From St. Augustine, FL to San Fransisco, CA:The Route Across Uruguay:
How can you help?
You
can help by sponsoring the tour itself, and by supporting the cause of Cannabis
education.  All bikes were funded by the tour's participants.  The following is a list of

</p><p><b>Our
story </b></p>
<p>Sometime early in 2013, we happened to read about some entrepreneurs using scrap tyres to make
footwear. We thought it was a neat idea and could be replicated in India as
well. When we started working on this initiative, we had no idea of how sandals
are manufactured; neither of us had any background in the footwear industry. So
we visited the localities where the cobbler community resides and started
interacting with a few cobblers. During such interactions, we became aware of
the various issues that these cobblers were plagued with. Life is daily
struggle for most of them. Hence we took a conscious decision to use profits
from this venture towards improving the living conditions of our cobblers and
provide them with access to better healthcare and education for their children.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What We Need </b></p>
<p>Having designed, manufactured and sold a few hundred sandals we now understand
the intricacies involved in the manufacturing of a sandal with soles made of
scrap tyres. Our goal is to aggressively market our products, both in the
domestic and international markets. Additionally we also need working space to
manufacture and store our sandals. Currently the cobblers work from their own
homes, but given the space constraints, it becomes difficult to execute large
orders. We need the funds, to scale up our operations, and to increase our
marketing efforts. Additionally the funds will also help us manage our cash
flows. </p>
<p>Our estimated funds requirements are US $ 18000 (Approx in Indian Rs
1,000,000). While we hope to raise this amount, we would still continue with
our operations and marketing plans. </p>
<p><b>What you get</b></p>
<p>As a token of appreciation for your contribution we would offer you a
range of perks, from listing in our Hall of Fame contributor’s list on our
website to a complimentary sandal of your choice, based on your contribution.</p>
<p><b>Other ways you can
help</b></p>
<p>While we understand that you may not be in a position to make a financial
contribution at this moment, you can definitely help us in spreading the work

<p>[The video above is the first in a series of short videos showing what's growing at our urban farm this year, because potential funders asked to see what I've done so far, even though it's not directly related to the IPCC in Cuba.  View <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDsRk37Oduw&amp;list=PL7TLfy2vmpNCgksIzpegDN7e_Gkspco5a"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the rest of the series</a> at YouTube.  Enjoy!]</p>
<p>Hi!  I'm Ben Stallings, of <a href=""http://interdependentweb.com/content/2012_tour"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""illustrated audio tour of our farm"">Interdependent Web Urban Farm</a>.  I got my <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Wikipedia on permaculture"">permaculture</a> design certification in 2010, and since then I've been teaching <a href=""http://interdependentweb.com/content/edible_ecosystems_part_1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""slides from Edible Ecosystems class"">basic introductory classes</a> and working on my own site as well as some friends' and neighbors' sites here in Emporia, Kansas.  This year I'm raising 75 crops for market on less than a tenth of an acre, and I've got three satellite sites around town, with the potential for more this fall.  I've gotten a lot of mileage out of my design certification class, but I've been waiting for the right opportunity to pursue further training.</p>
<p>For years I've been hearing about the <a href=""http://www.powerofcommunity.org/cm/index.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Power of Community documentary"">exciting progress that's been made in Cuba</a> since they lost their access to cheap fossil fuels in the early '90s.  From what I've heard, I believe Cuba gives us a glimpse into a possible sustainable future, if the rest of the world can turn our backs on fossil fuels.  I'd love to see for myself what's going on there, but of course it's illegal for an American citizen to visit Cuba except on business.</p>
<p>So imagine my excitement when I learned that the <a href=""http://www.ipc11cuba.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""IPC 11 site"">11th biennial International Permaculture Convergence</a> will be held in Havana!  This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me to see what's happening in Cuba while extending my knowlege and connections in the world of permaculture.  It will be an amazing and life-changing week, and you can not only make it happen for me, I'm giving you the chance to secure your own part of that experience for yourselves.</p>
<p>Now, it's not going to be a cheap trip.  I don't have the option of couchsurfing or hitchhiking or cutting corners; I have to book my trip to Cuba through an agency that takes care of all the arrangements, and I have to get to Cancún before I even meet up with them.  I'm looking at a minimum of $4,000 for this nine-day trip.  That's why I need your help.</p>
<p>But what can I offer you in return?  Well, souvenirs, of course... I can't bring back cigars or rum, and space will be limited in my suitcase, but I'll send you a postcard, and I'll take requests from larger donors for artworks, books, and music, and if I can find them I'll get them to you in time for Christmas.  But more importantly I'd like to offer you the benefit of what I learn while touring Cuba and attending the Permaculture Convergence.</p>
<p>If you contribute $25 or more, I'll share with you a series of presentations about everything I've learned on the trip, either in person or over the net, and I'll answer any questions you have about it.  If you contribute $100 or more, I'll give you an equivalent discount on my permaculture design services for your own property.  Contribute $1000 or more, and I'll personally make it happen.</p>
<p>I'm setting this campaign up so that if I don't reach my full goal of $4000, the funds will still go toward the trip... I'll just have to pay the rest out of pocket.  But if I exceed the goal, I'll have enough design work through your discounts to keep on doing what I love for months after the trip!</p>
<p>So this isn't just about sending me on some kind of vacation or business trip, it's an investment in a sustainable future for all of us.  I'm going to bring back the knowledge and share it with you, to help make your own property self-sustaining while building my business to be self-sustaining.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are a group of believers. We believe in the importance of nature, the challenges we have to face, the vast range of possibilities we have to make choices, our ability to make the right choices and do good for ourselves and for our planet. We believe that we can change the world and save the planet even if only with a first step...<br/></p>
<p>One of the things we are most passionate about are bicycles! Therefore we decided to start a project which would help people recognize all the positive effects of cycling while encouraging them to commit to support bicycle mobility. <br/></p>
<p>The international team of initiators is made up of SportKreativWerkstatt GmbH, the European Cyclists' Federation, AZIMUT, ispo Munich and forum Nachhaltig Wirtschaften (media partner). </p>
<p>All of us know believers who want to make a positive change in our world. We want to unite these people and join their power to maximize the global effect and strengthen bicycle mobility worldwide!</p>
<p>Together we stated our basic reasoning and our objectives in a communique titled ""Cycling is Sustainability"". In order to reach maximum effect with it, we plan to bring it to the UN Earth Summit Rio+20 in June 2012 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to attract the attention of heads of state, politicians and other important decision-makers. <br/></p>

</div></div>","We’re Verde Urbano, a entrepreneurship initiative that proposes attitude changes and environmental awareness in the citizens and works to generate alternatives to understand how people can interact and grow the city in harmony with nature.We want to transform the cities into green cities and we’ve decided to use the walls as our main resource.The plan is to transform the unused walls into useful walls, transforming them into interaction spaces with citizens, stimulating environmental awareness and generating green positive impact in the city with the delivery of plants.With your donations we will build five green walls and bring them life. With these walls we will be able to deliver a message to generate environmental awareness to 500 people. Also, we will make replica manuals so you can take the project anywhere in the world, generating a global citizen network with people who care about the environment.WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET:
Our goal is to achieve $8.500, money that will be used to make five green walls. Each of the walls costs $800, including a free plant delivery to citizens who want to interact with the initiative.
$2.000 will be used in the design, execution and distribution of replica manuals, so the initiative can be replicated anywhere in the world, making the urban green network of stakeholders, grow.
$400 will be used for the webpage (Hosting, design, codes)
$700 will be used for working, administrative expenses and contingencies of the project.
The rest of the money will be designated to our rewards delivery and to generating more projects made by Verde Urbano Colombia team so that we can keep impacting environmental issues in cities.If we don’t get completely funded, we will do the green walls in proportion to the amount of money we get.THE IMPACTBuilding more walls that are part of buildings, parking lots, shopping malls, subway stations and other places is inevitable for a city, and this activity generates about 50% of air pollution in urban areas and we know the city growth won't stop.Verde Urbano has decided to find alternatives and different ways to offset pollution caused by cities and we saw a lot of unused built areas in the streets, parks or bridges that we call ‘’useless walls’’; we believe this is the opportunity to stop looking forward and to look up, where the walls can have life.The plan is to transform a ‘’useless wall’’ into a useful space, transforming it into a green wall through co-created and collective action, generating environmental awareness in citizen, offsetting pollution for each plant funded and also creating a global network of stakeholders.The walls we want to change are in Medellín, Colombia. In our country there are no seasons because of the geographical location and this allows the plant to grow all year round and the weather won’t alter the wellbeing of a plant.The green wall will have a question mark shape; this is a expectative strategy for citizens with the catchword: IF THE WALLS COULD TALK? For this, each plant will have a message from its backer with an idea, thought or thank you note speaking about some environmental issue. This message will be received by the citizen who decided to take out the plant and plant it somewhere.This is where If the walls could talk? becomes an experience not only to the citizen but also for the backer, because the wall won't just simply be a wall becoming a useful wall, but a wall with life and ideas from and for the people.In Verde Urbano we believe its important to find different ways to evolve with the city, find alternatives to have more healthy cities, work towards environmentally sustainability and have every wall be used as a contribution to grow with the city, the citizen and the nature.SOME OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP1.- If you like the project, help us promoting it through social media networks.

In Génesis, by average, there will be 100 trees in a sector.</p><p>This strategy allows us the accomplish several things: <br/>- Independently of your purchasing power, you can become an environmental hero because you will be the co-owner of (at least) one sector. <br/>- Therefore, no matter how many shares you hold, you can walk around the forest. And more specifically within your sector, with a feeling of fulfillment and joy knowing you helped plant all those trees and you co-own them.</p><p>Reforestum aims that anyone, no matter its budget, no matter if you came from a rich country or not, you can become an environmental hero. So if a kid of 15 years old in Congo wants to owe 0,2 square meters, he/she can do it. And he/she can go and visit (now or in 30 years) that sector of the forest; And very proudly say: ""I owe this forest, a part of this forest is mine and I am making a difference.

Each member earns badges named after mythological heroes. By being an early member of Génesis you earn an additional badge, you will become a ""forest founder"". So you are getting 2 badges. The later, can be only earned during this campaign (And the previous one in Kickstarter).Average car (per year): 5.1 tones; A year of emails: 135 kg; New York to London (per person): 610 kg; New York to LA (per person): 438 kg; Ironing a shirt (per year): 7.8 kg; Watching 28"" TV per year: 140 kg; A year of toilet roll: 75 kg; Laundry (yearly): 440 kg; Year of cellphone calls (1 hr per day): 1,250 kg; To make a laptop 200 kg; A year of coffee: 210 kg; average world citizen (yearly): 7 tones.We already lunched a Kickstarter campaign from the 15th of January to the 15th of February an we got 132% funded (41.130€). We were selling the first shares of the first forest, Génesis. Through it, we raised enough money to build the first phase of our App.  Since then, we have received many messages from people asking us to become members. We still have more than half of Génesis surface available for you, so we decided to open a second campaign meanwhile we finish building the App. Through this campaign you can get the badge to become a founder member of Génesis. And we can collect enough money to build the second phase of the App (the native version for iOs and Android).You can ask us anytime, we will be happy to answer your questions.We have also built a website providing you a beta version of the App and more well presented information. It includes a FAQ's section (At the very end of this page).Well, we have deforested so much land and released so much CO2 into the atmosphere that the amounts of carbon in it caused global warming. Even if all of us all of a sudden, would live using solar electricity, we still have to fix our atmosphere and cool down the planet. Watch this video if you want to know: A few cool things about forests; Our motivation to start the project; And why Reforestum is needed in the world.  There are three straightforward ways to create, own and manage a forest:
By a given surface area.
By a given budget.
By offsetting the carbon footprint of a given item such as a flight, driving a car, taking a taxi, using electricity, sending an email, etc.
Reforestum measures the carbon footprint of your daily activities, offering you the possibility to become carbon neutral by planning and developing your own forests.You can manage, track, expand or even offer a forest as a gift. All using your computer, tablet or smartphone.You can offset, one-off, any of your individual actions such as taking a flight, taking a taxi, driving your car or even your electric bill. We also provide a periodic subscription in order to reduce your carbon footprint on a monthly basis.   There are a number of possibilities, for example, your communications, groceries, electricity, natural gas or petrol consumption. Share your forests with your family, friends and colleagues to help us bring about environmental awareness!Even though we are an international team, we believed that it would be best to start at home, in Spain. We know the markets, the people, the climate, the land, the flora and fauna, the language and the local laws, which gives us a head start.We have chosen a piece of land that occupies 4,6 hectares (11.36 acres). It is located close to the natural park of ""Picos de Europa"".The land has a 10% slope and has a beautiful gully. At the moment it is covered with shrubs and has about 15 oak trees in it that are about 15 years old.  This is the first patch of forest that was stolen from the mountain and that we are going to reforest. Sorry for the bad quality of the take.We will be preparing the land and starting to plant the trees in March 2017, planting will last about 3 weeks. We will plant 1.100 trees per hectare with native species: 50% pine trees, 30% oak trees, and 20% with a selection of native species. All of them using certified seedlings, which are genetically adapted to the region and therefore have a high rate of success (It also implies a smaller carbon footprint). Complete species list: Scots Pine (Pinus Sylvestris), Sessile Oak (Quercus Petraea), Pyrenean Oak (Quercus Pyrenaica), Cherry Tree (Prunus Avium), Rowan Tree (Sorbus Aucuparia), Largeleaf Linden (Tilia Plathyphyllos), Walnut Tree (Juglans), Downy Birch (Betula Alba), Common Hazel (Corylus Avellana), European Crab Apple (Malus Sylvestris), Common Whitebeam (Sorbus Aria), Common Hawthorn (Crataegus Monogyna), Narrow-Leafed Ash (Fraxinus Angustifolia)  Reforestum is a global project, it concerns all of us. Therefore, next locations we will be looking at will be: the Amazon, South East Asia, Zambia and North America.The raised funds will be used to build the digital platform that will support the project, connecting all our members (environmental heroes) with their forests and reunite them in the Reforestum community. The App will host many features such as our forest/carbon calculator (already available in beta version) or the monthly subscriptions system.  We already have a beta version of the Web App working, you can visit it by clicking on the next image.  Nature has its own Rhythm and we can’t force it.  Depending on climate, there are normally two windows in which we can plant trees: Before the spring. Only in places with an adequate amount of rain. Right at the beginning of autumn.  Reforestum will plant its first forest before the spring of 2017. We’ll plant at least 1 to 4 hectares depending on the success of this crowdfunding campaign.  At the end of the campaign, all backers will receive a code to sign up to our platform and start tracking their forest.  There are so many good reasons why someone would want to own a forest. You can buy a forest simply because you love nature, because you think more forests are needed in the world, because you think it is an amazing gift to offer, because you think is a great inheritance for your family or obviously because you want to help stop climate change.Either way, whatever the reason, we will probably love it!We would like to explain to you where our motivation came from to create Reforestum through a simple example.Let’s say I buy a car for my family. During its estimated lifetime (approx. 10 years/300.000 kms) this car will expel 50 tons of CO2 into the atmosphere.That’s quite a heavy carbon footprint for one car!Quite the environmental disaster. The good news is that today that is fixable through Reforestum.It suffices to plant 5 trees! They will grow and capture 50 tons (*) of CO2 in a few years. Your car will be carbon neutral. Problem solved, couldn’t be easier!We live in a fast world and we can’t change that. The most of us can’t afford to grow our own food, build our own houses or fix our own cars, we delegate some of our duties to experts. Now you can also hand over your responsibility to us to help stop climate change.And there are many more reasons why we think the world needs massive reforestation.Here are a few: The trees that we will plant together will have the purpose of capturing CO2 and releasing oxygen, calling rain, fixing the soil, refilling and protecting the water table, reestablishing biodiversity, recovering ecosystems and ultimately regulating climate.Reforestum forests are build on private land that is shared by all Reforestum members. There are a few reasons why we have chosen this model.It’s priority is to ensure the forests protection and its well being.Reforestum forests are created with the idea that the forests are natural sanctuaries that need to be protected, we are committed to safeguarding their longevity.When a member purchases a share, a formal contract will be signed. The contract will be amended for subsequent forest extensions for the same location.Member’s shares cannot be sold or transferred in order to avoid speculation and protect the forest’s best interest.We believe that the idea of a hero has to be redefined in the 21st century.  It is no longer about a single hero fighting in a battle like David and Goliath. But rather like thousands of Davids fighting for the same cause and with one goal in mind: Ensuring a safe and abundant future for the earth and it’s future generations.  If we all stand together, as a horde of David's, with the same goal in mind, how could we not defeat Goliath?How else could we reward you for your support of the project? Of course, all rewards will result in owning a forest.So you can create your own forest today. Isn’t that awesome!We have made a selection of the most badass heroes in mythology in order to designate our rewards. We value the effort that each one of our supporters have contributed to stop climate change through Reforestum. Diego Sanz is the founder of Reforestum.

Please have a look to the corresponding section in our KS page where we provide the whole list of species we are going to plant.In the future, when we have more available locations, we will offer you a wider spectrum of options, then you will be able to choose several forest in different countries with a wide catalog of species, and you will be able to diversify your forests.Further than that we will implement a service in which we can assist you to design a forest, including many parameters, such as species. However such service needs to be developed and it will imply that the final cost of purchasing a forest will be noticeably more expensive. As a tree, we need to grow strong before facing that phase.Yes, There will be a public list.This is a way to be transparent and guarantee the members unique ownership of the forests.Of course, each member will decided its level of privacy.Meanwhile some members might choose to show their names and profile pictures, others might choose to show an avatar and nickname; And others may want to be completely anonymous, in which case only a code will be shown.Our forest engineers have established a schedule to take car of the forest along the time.The first 25 years of maintenance and taxes over the land, is included in the price per sqm that your are pledging in the campaign.As you might know, the members acquire an agreement with Reforestum for the ownership of the forest that have no limitation in time.As you might also know, our members pay only once for their forest, so, what happens after 25 years?We are designing the forests to be self sustainable, as any natural forest is. However, our governments, as opposed to nature, decided to charge us taxes.So, how is the maintenance (Including taxes) is going to be afforded after that period of time?Well, the forest will produce a yield. We are going to plant many nut trees, getting agreements with local farmers to harvest honey, and getting agreements with local hall towns.However, no one on earth can say with 100% of certainty how the markets or the taxes will be 25 in advance. Therefore, we have a plan B. In the remote case non of the former possibilities happen to be enough, we will cut down as many trees are needed. We plan that cutting 1 to 3 trees in one hectare, and selling the timber, will be more than enough to keep all running for, at least, 10 years more.Last question, what happens if the forest produces more yield than the cost is?We will share the profit with the members in a form of credits that they will be able to use to extend their forests.",42.0,2,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573813899/pqd1fdprnox7umrq4hy6.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">        <strong style=""text-align: center;font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Have you ever wondered what happens to your ""recycled"" plastic items? </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Do you really know where it goes? </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>S</strong>tatistics show over 91% of plastic isn't recycled and goes directly to landfills. And nothing is being done about it.  Between 1950 and 2015, humans produced 8.3 billion metric tons of plastics, 6.3 billion tons of which ended up in landfills. (source: <a href=""https://www.greenmatters.com/news/2017/07/21/KgtjP/plastic-study"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GREENMATTERS</a>)  The 1's and 3's that are deemed acceptable for recycling are not so easily sorted out, and unfortunately, waste management companies do not see it as worth their time or money. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Pacific Resource Recycling Systems (PACRRS ) aims to use a closed-loop gasification system to turn plastic into reusable and renewable energy and resources with <strong>zero emissions</strong>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">At PACRRS, our facility will take any plastics, clean or dirty, and use it as a fuel to create a renewable energy.  So if you are worried about where your plastics go and what happens to it, we are here to tell you that we ARE doing something about it!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">PACRRS was started to not only remove, but also reuse plastics to create a clean and reusable energy that we can all use today, and for future generations.  Our passion is to do something about this epidemic, and the oceans of plastic that are clogging the arteries of our planet.  Through new technology, and with the help of proven processes that have been around for years, we are able to provide a place where we can do just that.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The PACRRS team is committed to bringing good paying jobs to the local Lebanon community and the larger Willamette Valley as a whole while protecting the environment for all to live, work, and play.  However, our goal to work towards solving this problem of plastics and nonrenewable energy sources cannot be possible without your help and support.</p>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Our Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Each day, the PACRRS facility will be able to process 50 metric tons of plastics and generate countless quantities of renewable assets by starting off with one gasification unit using cutting edge technology.  In the future, we hope to be able to expand and scale up to 4-6 units in Lebanon as well as look into opening up more facilities in other counties and states.  The amount of processed tons of plastic will grow in size as new units evolve, growing from 50 metric tons to upwards of 100 tons or more as engineering efforts increase to create larger capacity gasification units.</p>
<p>All types of plastic would be able to be collected and used for the process, including: </p>
<ul>
<li>Straws</li>
<li>Styrofoam</li>
<li>Film Plastics</li>
<li>Carpets</li>
<li>Car Parts (plastic)</li>
</ul>
<p>With your support, PACRRS will be the first commercial operation that starts using plastic as a fuel, to spearhead the effort to clean the planet of plastic while providing much-needed resources and energy.</p>
<p>In turn, the facility's gasification process will provide specific renewable resources through our engineering efforts, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Syngas</li>
<li>Fuel</li>
<li>Electricity</li>
<li>Hydrogen</li>
<li>Renewable Natural Gas (RNG)</li>
<li>Ethanol</li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>
<strong>Our Technology</strong><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span>
</h3>
<p>PACRRS will use gasification technology, which converts organic- or fossil fuel-based carbonaceous materials into carbon monoxide, hydrogen and carbon dioxide.  This is achieved by reacting the material at high temperatures.</p>
<p>Compared to an average waste burning system, PACRRS will be using the latest technology to reach temperatures of around 4000+°​F which ensures that all waste breaks down at the molecular level.  Organic material is vaporized and collected as a clean syngas.  Inorganic material melts and is collected as metal and non-leaching vitrified stone. There are no major byproducts from the process that require additional disposal.  Our ultimate goal is to create completely clean, reusable energy and outputs that are all contained in a closed-looped system to emit zero waste.  We believe this is what sets PACRRS apart from others who use traditional gasification processes.</p>
<p><u>Gasification Overview</u>:  This is a very basic model of the gasification process.  The full ability and additional technologies that are needed to produce the energies we have outlined are not shown here, due to classifications and restrictions.</p>

<p><u>Site Model</u>:  The following is a set of different sections that will be uniform once we can share the completed model.  Due to ongoing configuration and engineering, we can only show small sections at a time.  The general idea is Receive, Ingest, Clean, and lastly Store clean energy.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Future Partnerships &amp; Education Goals</strong></h3>
<p>Our community is at the heart of our operation and drives everything that we do.  With the 46 acres of land that has already been acquired for our facility, the PACRRS team would like to set aside, study, and protect a large portion of the land and wetlands.  To do so, the team is highly interested in strategic partnerships with local companies, nonprofits, and educational institutions.</p>
<p><strong>Strategic Partnerships:</strong>   We are looking to partner with companies or nonprofits that specifically have a concern or issue with increased consumption rates, the continuing generation of plastics, and how they are disposed of or recycled.  This partnership will work closely with our executive team to build a strategy and on-going relationships that will be beneficial to both parties.</p>
<p><strong>Educational Partnerships:</strong>  We are also looking to partner with local and regional businesses, universities, community organizations, nonprofits, and K-12 schools with the overall goal to promote educational access and opportunities.  We hope to create partnerships that allow students to build on their education around Environmental Studies and Engineering Studies, in addition to creating fellowships, internships, and research opportunities either associated with the facility or the surrounding ecosystem.  To accommodate this, our plans will include establishing an R&amp;D facility that can accommodate interns, scholarship students, and local graduates working in a relevant environmental or engineering degree.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Our Budget</strong></h3>
<p>While this technology has not been used commercially before, it has been used privately.  The PACRRS team has completed a site visit and the due diligence in order to estimate that an excess of 5 million dollars will be needed.  To get started, however, we will need $500,000.</p>
<p>Money raised with this campaign will help us start the process of acquiring property and start the process of building warehouses to store collected plastic materials before they are processed through industrial shredders to become fuel, addition to recruiting help.</p>
<p>Budget Needs: </p>
<ul>
<li>Site Preparation (Cleanup, Structural &amp; Environmental Assessments) -  200k</li>
<li>Structure to House Collected Plastics - 100k</li>
<li>Industrial Shredders - 60-100k</li>
<li>Conveyor Implementation - 60-100k</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p><u>The Risks</u>:</p>
<p>There are a lot of areas we need to keep an eye on and be very aware of.  Being part of a new energy offering, there are many hurdles one can face when building in a new area that needs a lot of attention prior to the build.  We want to be diligent in our procedures, and keep a detailed account and checklist of all things that can affect the day-to-day operations.   We will be working closely with environmental and engineering companies to make sure we can offset as many potential risks as possible.</p>
<u>The Challenges</u>:<p>When building something as big as this in terms of sheer production of renewable resources, we have be aware of the hidden dangers that can rise.  Our focus is to be as transparent as possible, and to do everything accordingly.  Our potential challenges include possible rejection from the community of what we are planning, zoning problems within the city, and environmental hurdles as we start building.  However, the great thing about our campaign is that the Lebanon community and Mayor Paul Aziz have been behind our mission and vision from the beginning.  The ease of doing business and working with the City of Lebanon has been more than welcoming on many levels.  This helps us in our efforts to know we have help when we need it, and that it eases the challenges we may face.</p>

<h3> </h3>
</div></div>","Introduction

 
        Have you ever wondered what happens to your ""recycled"" plastic items? 
Do you really know where it goes? 
Statistics show over 91% of plastic isn't recycled and goes directly to landfills. And nothing is being done about it.  Between 1950 and 2015, humans produced 8.3 billion metric tons of plastics, 6.3 billion tons of which ended up in landfills. (source: GREENMATTERS)  The 1's and 3's that are deemed acceptable for recycling are not so easily sorted out, and unfortunately, waste management companies do not see it as worth their time or money. 
Pacific Resource Recycling Systems (PACRRS ) aims to use a closed-loop gasification system to turn plastic into reusable and renewable energy and resources with zero emissions.
At PACRRS, our facility will take any plastics, clean or dirty, and use it as a fuel to create a renewable energy.  So if you are worried about where your plastics go and what happens to it, we are here to tell you that we ARE doing something about it!
PACRRS was started to not only remove, but also reuse plastics to create a clean and reusable energy that we can all use today, and for future generations.  Our passion is to do something about this epidemic, and the oceans of plastic that are clogging the arteries of our planet.  Through new technology, and with the help of proven processes that have been around for years, we are able to provide a place where we can do just that.
The PACRRS team is committed to bringing good paying jobs to the local Lebanon community and the larger Willamette Valley as a whole while protecting the environment for all to live, work, and play.  However, our goal to work towards solving this problem of plastics and nonrenewable energy sources cannot be possible without your help and support.

 
Our Impact
Each day, the PACRRS facility will be able to process 50 metric tons of plastics and generate countless quantities of renewable assets by starting off with one gasification unit using cutting edge technology.  In the future, we hope to be able to expand and scale up to 4-6 units in Lebanon as well as look into opening up more facilities in other counties and states.  The amount of processed tons of plastic will grow in size as new units evolve, growing from 50 metric tons to upwards of 100 tons or more as engineering efforts increase to create larger capacity gasification units.
All types of plastic would be able to be collected and used for the process, including: 

Straws
Styrofoam
Film Plastics
Carpets
Car Parts (plastic)

With your support, PACRRS will be the first commercial operation that starts using plastic as a fuel, to spearhead the effort to clean the planet of plastic while providing much-needed resources and energy.
In turn, the facility's gasification process will provide specific renewable resources through our engineering efforts, such as:

Syngas
Fuel
Electricity
Hydrogen
Renewable Natural Gas (RNG)
Ethanol

 

Our Technology 

PACRRS will use gasification technology, which converts organic- or fossil fuel-based carbonaceous materials into carbon monoxide, hydrogen and carbon dioxide.  This is achieved by reacting the material at high temperatures.
Compared to an average waste burning system, PACRRS will be using the latest technology to reach temperatures of around 4000+°​F which ensures that all waste breaks down at the molecular level.  Organic material is vaporized and collected as a clean syngas.  Inorganic material melts and is collected as metal and non-leaching vitrified stone. There are no major byproducts from the process that require additional disposal.  Our ultimate goal is to create completely clean, reusable energy and outputs that are all contained in a closed-looped system to emit zero waste.  We believe this is what sets PACRRS apart from others who use traditional gasification processes.
Gasification Overview:  This is a very basic model of the gasification process.  The full ability and additional technologies that are needed to produce the energies we have outlined are not shown here, due to classifications and restrictions.

Site Model:  The following is a set of different sections that will be uniform once we can share the completed model.  Due to ongoing configuration and engineering, we can only show small sections at a time.  The general idea is Receive, Ingest, Clean, and lastly Store clean energy.

 
Future Partnerships & Education Goals
Our community is at the heart of our operation and drives everything that we do.  With the 46 acres of land that has already been acquired for our facility, the PACRRS team would like to set aside, study, and protect a large portion of the land and wetlands.  To do so, the team is highly interested in strategic partnerships with local companies, nonprofits, and educational institutions.
Strategic Partnerships:   We are looking to partner with companies or nonprofits that specifically have a concern or issue with increased consumption rates, the continuing generation of plastics, and how they are disposed of or recycled.  This partnership will work closely with our executive team to build a strategy and on-going relationships that will be beneficial to both parties.
Educational Partnerships:  We are also looking to partner with local and regional businesses, universities, community organizations, nonprofits, and K-12 schools with the overall goal to promote educational access and opportunities.  We hope to create partnerships that allow students to build on their education around Environmental Studies and Engineering Studies, in addition to creating fellowships, internships, and research opportunities either associated with the facility or the surrounding ecosystem.  To accommodate this, our plans will include establishing an R&D facility that can accommodate interns, scholarship students, and local graduates working in a relevant environmental or engineering degree.
 
Our Budget
While this technology has not been used commercially before, it has been used privately.  The PACRRS team has completed a site visit and the due diligence in order to estimate that an excess of 5 million dollars will be needed.  To get started, however, we will need $500,000.
Money raised with this campaign will help us start the process of acquiring property and start the process of building warehouses to store collected plastic materials before they are processed through industrial shredders to become fuel, addition to recruiting help.
Budget Needs: 

Site Preparation (Cleanup, Structural & Environmental Assessments) -  200k
Structure to House Collected Plastics - 100k
Industrial Shredders - 60-100k
Conveyor Implementation - 60-100k

 


Risks & Challenges
The Risks:
There are a lot of areas we need to keep an eye on and be very aware of.  Being part of a new energy offering, there are many hurdles one can face when building in a new area that needs a lot of attention prior to the build.  We want to be diligent in our procedures, and keep a detailed account and checklist of all things that can affect the day-to-day operations.   We will be working closely with environmental and engineering companies to make sure we can offset as many potential risks as possible.
The Challenges:When building something as big as this in terms of sheer production of renewable resources, we have be aware of the hidden dangers that can rise.  Our focus is to be as transparent as possible, and to do everything accordingly.  Our potential challenges include possible rejection from the community of what we are planning, zoning problems within the city, and environmental hurdles as we start building.  However, the great thing about our campaign is that the Lebanon community and Mayor Paul Aziz have been behind our mission and vision from the beginning.  The ease of doing business and working with the City of Lebanon has been more than welcoming on many levels.  This helps us in our efforts to know we have help when we need it, and that it eases the challenges we may face.

<p>As an Association, we have a beautiful project in our hands and we need your help! We are organizing our first volunteering trip to Thailand to go and see, with our own eyes, how one of the most active Sanctuaries of elephants in Thailand helps them live in a more decent way and takes care of them. By working as volunteers in the Kindred Spirits Sanctuary, the one chosen for this campaign, we want to put our #mover spirit into practise! But we don’t want to simply go there and that’s it… We want to show the world what is happening and our experience, recording a documentary so everyone can see the great task of the team and the volunteers working in places like this Sanctuary and how they are able to organize everything with such a low budget.</p>
</div><div>
<p>The estimated cost of this crowdfunding campaign includes budgets for recording and the cost of five volunteers who will be able to win a place in our mission. Three of the five places will be randomly offered, through a raffle, to all the people who donate more than 5€ to the campaign. The other two places will be offered on social networks, so be sure to follow us on Facebook and Instagram!  </p>
<p>You can help us make our dream possible and be a #mover as well! Starting at just 1€, the price of a simple coffee, you can make the difference and join this growing community. </p> <p>Moving the Planet - Creating #movers all around the world</p>

<p>Our campaign is focused on helping elephants, but we cannot forget the philosophy that is behind everything we do. Our main goal is to help start a change in the world and turn it into a cleaner, healthier and more solidary Earth, thanks to our positive actions. As #movers, we fight for equal rights, solidarity, sustainability and respect for nature and all the resources found on this Earth, alive or not, always inspired by a deep and active connection with our body through physical activity and positivity. And that is the impact we want to generate: raise awareness of the importance of taking care of nature and the environment, of treating people fairly and not misusing the resources we can find in this world. </p>

Both located in the Canary Islands, we share a common dream and a clear philosophy: we want to change the world through a #mover attitude or, at least, leave our #mover footprint for the generations who are to come through our three main values: sustainability, solidarity and sports - the three pillars of the #mover spirit.
Do you want to know more about us? Check our website and follow us on social networks.

As an Association, we have a beautiful project in our hands and we need your help! We are organizing our first volunteering trip to Thailand to go and see, with our own eyes, how one of the most active Sanctuaries of elephants in Thailand helps them live in a more decent way and takes care of them. By working as volunteers in the Kindred Spirits Sanctuary, the one chosen for this campaign, we want to put our #mover spirit into practise! But we don’t want to simply go there and that’s it… We want to show the world what is happening and our experience, recording a documentary so everyone can see the great task of the team and the volunteers working in places like this Sanctuary and how they are able to organize everything with such a low budget.

The estimated cost of this crowdfunding campaign includes budgets for recording and the cost of five volunteers who will be able to win a place in our mission. Three of the five places will be randomly offered, through a raffle, to all the people who donate more than 5€ to the campaign. The other two places will be offered on social networks, so be sure to follow us on Facebook and Instagram!  
You can help us make our dream possible and be a #mover as well! Starting at just 1€, the price of a simple coffee, you can make the difference and join this growing community.  Moving the Planet - Creating #movers all around the world
 


 
Our campaign is focused on helping elephants, but we cannot forget the philosophy that is behind everything we do. Our main goal is to help start a change in the world and turn it into a cleaner, healthier and more solidary Earth, thanks to our positive actions. As #movers, we fight for equal rights, solidarity, sustainability and respect for nature and all the resources found on this Earth, alive or not, always inspired by a deep and active connection with our body through physical activity and positivity. And that is the impact we want to generate: raise awareness of the importance of taking care of nature and the environment, of treating people fairly and not misusing the resources we can find in this world. 
 






 

Can't donate? You can simply help by sharing the campaign!
We know not everyone is able to donate... But we're sure you can share the campaign and participate in our contests online! So, be sure to share our campaign and spread the word!

Jewish Shepherd's Tent 

<p>
</p><p>Avraham
Herzlich came to Israel many years ago, as a young man in search of
his Jewish identity. After a long boat ride from America, he took off
his shoes and walked the width and length of the Holy Land, barefoot.
On his trek, he discovered Torah Judaism in the Yemenite community's
traditions. He found his calling in herding small cattle, like the
fathers of the nation of Israel - Avraham, Itzhak and Yaakov. He
realized that a shepherd in the field, whose livelihood is truly
reliant on the rains and seasons, can develop a sense of direct
connection between himself - a simple Jew - and G-d and His
blessings. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Avraham
has been shepherding his flock of goats and sheep in the hills of
Israel for over 40 years now - first in the Galil, and later in
Shomron. He and his wife Aviva brought up their eleven children to
value being close to the land and nature, and learning the ways of
HaShem. Thirteen years ago, major tragedy struck Avraham's family
when his daughter Talya and her husband Binyamin were killed in a
roadside ambush by terrorists. Their six children were left orphans,
to be raised by their extended family. And as if that were not
enough, four years ago, his entire herd of 400 goats was stolen and
transported into the Palestinian Authority, and lost forever. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With
the small herd he has succeeded in gathering since, Avraham spends
many hours every day out in the grazing lands near the town of Kfar
Tapuach in Shomron. He walks many kilometers each day, moving his
flock to fresh pastures, assisted by his faithful shepherd dogs and
his grandchildren, who learn Torah and read Psalms with him, while
enjoying the wonders of nature and the beautiful scenery of the hills
of Samaria.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In
short, Avraham has a unique life, and a story to tell. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The
idea:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Avraham
is not as young as he once was; his work is not getting any easier,
and he has been through a lot. His daughter and son-in-law, Mollie
and David Ha'ivri, came up with an idea that would help Avraham
transform his life’s work into something that could be shared with
people who wish to learn more about his ideals. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>They
have built a visitor's tent in the middle of his grazing land at Kfar
Tapuach, and launched a Facebook page for the Jewish Shepherd. They
have begun coordinating tour group visits with Avraham the Shepherd.
The first season of this program was a big success. Tour groups
included farmers from America, motorcycle clubs from Israel, new
immigrants from the former Soviet Union, Chabad Hasidim from New
York, and journalists from both BBC and Arabic-language Alhura TV. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In
some very unusual weather this past winter, Israel experienced two
heavy blizzards. The first one was preceded by very strong winds,
which caused major damage to the Shepherd's visitors’ tent. Now
that the winter is behind us, we need to rebuild and expand the site
to facilitate the expected flow of visitors this coming spring,
summer and fall. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We
need your help to make this happen. We plan to rebuild and expand the
visitors’ tent, build restrooms for guests, build a cooking area
and a pita bread oven, clear an area for car and bus parking, set up
a shooting range for bow and arrow archery activities, build a
holding pen for the goats, near the tent, and fence in grazing lands
nearby. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The
overall budget to do all of these things is about $75,000. But as we
are known for doing the best we can with what we can get, we are
looking to raise at least $5000, to start. Feel free to contact us
directly, if you are interested in sponsoring major parts of this

After working in Environmental Education at the San Marcos Springs with the Meadows Center for several years, organizer Ashley Wright became inspired to share the majesty of the Springs and the unique ecosystem with a greater audience.

The Festival was born out of a River’s  dream. After working in Environmental Education at the San Marcos Springs with the Meadows Center for several years, organizer Ashley Wright became inspired to share the majesty of the Springs and the unique ecosystem with a greater audience. Once she pitched the idea to her dearest friend and co-worker, Samantha Beasley, the duo became determined to reach out to the entire community about the importance of the River. Unsure of exactly how to begin such a grand endeavor, the two Texas State Alumni partnered up with their long time friend, an experienced and enthusiastic festival organizer, Thomas Waymouth, who brought all of his creative knowledge to their dynamic. With all of their powers combined, they reached out to the City of San Marcos and were invited to create River Awareness Day, the pilot event for the Texas Wild Rice Festival.In 2013 we put together River Awareness Day; which was named ""Best New Flow Festival"" by the Austin Chronicle.  It was held on August 3rd 2013 and it was made possible by the sponsorship of the San Marcos River Foundation, the Habitat Conservation Plan, and Community Impact Newspaper as well as the donation of the use of City Park by the city of San Marcos.  The three organizers put in over 2000 hours to make it happen with no remuneration other than satisfaction that comes from bringing community together over water. We received an education grant from the HCP for $5000 and with the help of local businesses, nonprofits and community volunteers we were able to create a festival that was educational, interactive, and loads of fun!This year the educational grant is no longer available so it is up to us as a community to co-create this event.  Normally this kind of opportunity to support the creation of a festival is only offered to businesses, but we wanted to offer it to all the individuals of our community as well.  This way each person has a voice.  We can show Indiegogo, our city, and the world how much the people of our community care about how we develop, what our priorities are, and how we can choose to craft and guide our identity together. Thank you Friends,Keep San Marcos Flowing! Special thanks to the Yakona team for their underwater footage and photography!",11.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Globally and more specifically in Europe, Japan and the United States of America, consumers and governments are demanding high quality and healthy food. Honey is one such food product. With the spread of pollution it is becoming more and more difficult to provide these markets with adequate quantities of honey that is raw, pure and free of pollutants.</p>
<p>Retailers in South Africa are demanding locally produced (pure and ethically traded honey) for their private labels, but are struggling to find reliable suppliers. A recent history of government rebated cheap imported honey, created barriers of entry to honey producers, because the costs of honey production in South Africa were higher than the cost of importing it. A growing consumer awareness about the plight of the honeybee and the quality (or lack thereof) of honey in general, offers beekeepers an opportunity to compete with the imported honeys. South African consumers are also becoming more and more aware of the fact that all imported honey into SA is radurised by law, making it far less healthy than locally produced pure honey.</p>
<p>African rural communities often live in areas adjacent to unpolluted prime honey producing vegetation, (capable of producing organic honey) that they do not benefit from, nor realise the potential. In identifying this opportunity, African Honey Bee (AHB) has been established as a social enterprise to roll out a biblical model that provides:</p>

<h3>Summary of the African Honey Bee Method</h3>
<p></p>
<p>African Honey Bee has been exploring ways to empower potential and existing honey producers and then link them to the honey consumers, enabling all to benefit from the relationship. First a stable platform based on a “hub-and-spoke” principle is established. Profitable incubation farms are set up to produce viable volumes of honey, enabling critical mass and thereby providing partner beekeepers access to appropriate technology, infrastructure, training, quality control, logistical support and access to markets.</p>
<p>The incubation farms not only provide a stable platform for market off-takers that require relationships with “big farmer” type operations, but also an environment for partnering with, and incubating beekeepers.</p>
<p>Beekeepers that partner with AHB are provided with:</p>

<p>AHB is able to guarantee its product quality to the consumer, because as a prerequisite for the partnership it has with its beekeepers, it requires the beekeepers to:</p>
<p>1) manage their bees according to the Afri-hiveTM system - a specific method of organic beekeeping that it has developed,</p>
<p>2) use AHB’s NektarTM management and traceability technology,</p>
<p>3) be compliant with AHB quality standards and</p>
<p>4) be managed and mentored by an AHB senior beekeeper.</p>
<p>Prospective beekeepers from rural areas with beekeeping potential, who are generally between the ages of 18 – 26, are recruited to participate in the AHB incubation programme. They spend between 4 - 18 months (depending on their prior knowledge and experience) in an incubation programme during which time they are officially employed by the incubator as salaried working interns. During their incubation, the interns complete an AHB developed, SAQA accredited NQF level 1 Learnership in beekeeping. They gain practical experience by working under guidance of senior beekeepers on an AHB commercial bee farm. During the incubation programme the interns are also assisted to either start their own beekeeping business on a small scale or expand their existing business, with the view of commercialising it once they complete the incubation process. At the end of their incubation, the beekeepers automatically become beneficiaries in the AHB Stakeholder Trust. In other words, they become shareholders in AHB Kruger Park (Pty) Ltd, the main operating entity of the group. Highly competent beekeepers also stand to be qualified as AHB senior beekeepers to supervise beekeeping activities according to AHB quality standards.</p>

<p>A beekeeper development Trust (that owns 10% of the equity in AHB Kruger Park (Pty) Ltd) raises grant funding to provide support to partner beekeepers in the form of mentorship, training, logistics, access to low cost equipment and consumables.</p>
<p>AHB’s African Honey Bee Kruger Park incubator has been operating since April 2013, and is expected to function at full capacity (2 500 hives) by July 2015. AHB plans to expand its commercial operations into the 30,000 ha of Sappi owned Eucalyptus grandis plantations that it has a tender to use.</p>
<p>During 2013 twelve beekeepers from Vhembe municipality in Limpopo Province joined AHB as beekeeper partners and have been supplying AHB with excellent quality honey ever since. Recently 27 Vhembe beekeepers under their representative – John Mudau - sent AHB a letter requesting formal engagement and membership as beneficiaries in the AHB Stakeholder Trust.</p>
<p>Early in 2014, Lima Rural Development Foundation asked AHB to consult on developing a plan to revive a number of beekeeping projects on Sappi land in KwaZulu Natal.</p>
<p>Although AHB believes that there is potential for replicating the model elsewhere in southern Africa and the developing world, I feel that AHB needs more time to prove concept and therefore do not wish to expand before June 2015.</p>

planet is being murdered. Mountains are falling. The oceans are dying. The
climate itself is bleeding out and it may be beyond repair. Industrial
civilization has entered its thrashing endgame. Technology can’t fix it and
shopping—no matter how green—won’t stop it. And we are out of time.</p>
<p>The
environmental movement has severely truncated its strategic thinking by
insisting on education, consumer choices, and legislative initiatives as the
only options for action. None of these can address the scale of the emergency
facing our planet.</p>
<p>To
save this planet, we need a serious resistance movement that can bring down the
industrial economy. Authors Derrick Jensen and Lierre Keith with filmmaker
Carson Wright are producing a film that will make the case for that movement.<b><br/></b></p><p><b>You can help us tell this story.</b><i><br/></i></p><p><i>On the Side of the Living</i> starts where
the environmental movement leaves off: civilization can never be sustainable
and is ultimately incompatible with life. People of courage and conscience are
now stranded between moral agony and moral agency: the only certainty is that
our one and only home will soon be a bare rock if we do nothing. Within that
terrible urgency, the film confronts the possibility—and possible necessity­—of
principled, militant resistance.</p>

<p>Time is short. One hundred species disappeared yesterday,
100 species are disappearing today, and another 100 will disappear tomorrow.
Meanwhile, those in power are using their control over the culture industry to
churn out story after story, book after book, film after film seducing us to
forget and encouraging the masses to snuggle back into the warm illusion of
civilization. <i>On the Side of the Living</i>
combats the lies of those in power. Your support will help us spread our

<p><b>Risks &amp;
Challenges</b></p>
<p>A
film supporting a principled, militant resistant movement will probably not be
overwhelmingly popular with the mainstream population. <i>On the Side of the Living</i>’s message will most likely prevent it
from receiving material support from traditional sources of funding like
corporations or government grants. But, as so many resistance movements have
proven – from the efforts of the women suffragists, to the IRA, and to the
Movement for the Emancipation of Niger Delta – a committed group of militant
resistors can win. </p>

In the project ""SB"" included a wide range of organizational, educational and research activities.Each work season includes block of one-day events and 30-days volunteer camp. Volunteer camp is our special pride! It is called Baikal Shore Service (BBS). During period of BSS we work at Baikal shores as public inspectors, doing clean up, territory ennoblement, education and enlightening, patrol work. We not only inhibit environmental damage but also hold efficient preventing activity. We work at most hard, popular territories as civil support to administration. We also work at barely reachable areas. Here at «Save Baikal»  we try to clean Baikal lake and reform people's minds in order to save beautiful nature. Unfourtantly, our project is not supported financially by government. We hope it will change some day, but for now we have to search for commercial sponsors every season as well as taking part at different local and international contests and grant programms. Each season is a challenge. We are doing great work but we do not show our maximum and do not actualize all the ideas we have.We hope to gain additional money so we can change that! We would like to establish on-line stream right from our camps during  «Baikal shore service» on Baikal in July of 2015. We also would love to improve our web site, translate it to different languages, create nice and interesting interactive web map that would help to establish efficient monitoring of environmental conditions, publish our methodological material so other people could use our experience, create agitation and enlightment materials for hotels, administration and other interested groups, start forest protection and fish reproduction programms! And lots more! We are also in need of money due to increasing ammount of volunteers and lack of essential supplies. We want to use funded money to give more people chance to join us and to show the world what happends inside our camps and hope to get public attention on ecological issues. 
We invite everyone to attened our camp and events. Our movement includes lots of interesting people from various countries and cultures and we always are happy to welcome new members of our growing society. It is a truely unique experience that not only lets you meet new people but also allows you to add your drop to our goal. And when it comes to environment, every drop matters.On Baikal we are admired by locals and are supported by a variety of Russian and international companies. Sometimes they help us with automobiles or other essential resources. Here is a video made by one of our major partners ""UNDP"" and ""GEF"". Check it to understand why we love Baikal so much:

developing an affordable home heating and cooling system that uses only
renewable energy sources and achieves amazing cost savings.</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>WHY YOU SHOULD CARE</b></p>
<p>The cost of heating and cooling is increasing much faster
than inflation for both electric based heating/cooling and fossil fuel based
heating such as with natural gas. For instance, in Ontario, the cost to heat
and cool our homes with electricity has been increasing by 12-15% each year in
the last few years. This trend is expected to continue for the foreseeable
future. Natural gas had a few good years recently but increased dramatically in
April 2014 for residents of Ontario (+40%) and is also expected to continue
increasing faster than inflation.</p>
<p>The longer we use sources of energy that are not
sustainable, the more we will pay for it personally (to heat and cool our
homes) and environmentally with global warming’s devastating effects. </p>
<p>We need to do something about it today, while we can still
make a difference.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>THE PROBLEM</b></p>
<p>There are no affordable green options for home owners living
in locations where the temperature reaches below 0 degree Celsius. </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>THE SOLUTION</b></p>
<p>After two and half years of research
&amp; development, we are proud to have developed an innovative heating and
cooling system that can reduce the cost to heat and cool a home by up to 80%
(depending on various parameters like the location, orientation, etc.). The
best part is that our system is truly affordable for all home owners since:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>There are no upfront costs</span></li>

monthly savings are higher than the monthly cost for our system</span>

<span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'></span>
<span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Savings
start from day 1 (no more waiting for a payback then savings)</span><br/>
</li>
</ul><p><b></b> </p><p><b>THE SYSTEM</b></p>
<p>Our system uses
gravel to increase the efficiency of a heat pump, which looks like an Air
Conditioning unit but can both heat and cool your home. Thanks to the gravel,
the heat pump can work all year round, even in climates where the temperature
dips below zero degrees Celsius. Gravel is a great storage medium with
excellent heat retention properties. It is durable, widely available, and has a
low cost. The gravel reservoir is preferable installed under the foundations
during construction, and thus does not reduce available space such as a
basement. </p>
<p><b><u>Here is how the system works:</u></b></p>
<p>During the <b>winter</b> cycle (see below), gravel
air is heated during the day as is passes through solar air heating panels. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/771449/files/20140806190656-Solar_Panel_02C.gif?1407377216"" src="""" style=""width: 583.63px; height: 337px;""/></p><br/><p>The warm air is
blown into the gravel and is used as needed. At night (or during the day), when
the inside temperature starts to fall, the heat pump is activated as needed to
transfer the stored heat from the gravel to the house. This warms up the house,
and cools down the gravel. The cycle starts over the next day.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/837199/files/20140905144948-2014-09-03_Winter_Day.png?1409953788"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/837198/files/20140905144931-2014-09-03_Winter_Night.png?1409953771"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p>
<p>During the <b>summer</b> cycle (see below), fresh outside air is blown into the
gravel at night, cooling it down; during the day the heat pump is activated as
needed and uses the cooled gravel, making the heat pump run more efficiently.
This cools the house, and warms up the gravel. The cycle starts over the next
night.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/837202/files/20140905145017-2014-09-03_Summer_Night.png?1409953817"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/837204/files/20140905145031-2014-09-03_Summer_Day.png?1409953831"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><br/><p>Our system also

location for our Small Scale Prototype, established academic partners in Ottawa
(Carleton University and La Cité) and have found sources of financing to take
care of about $66,000 of the funds needed for this $76,000 project. We are
seeking your help to raise the remaining $11,000 (including Indiegogo fees)

developing an affordable home heating and cooling system that uses only
renewable energy sources and achieves amazing cost savings.
WHY YOU SHOULD CARE
The cost of heating and cooling is increasing much faster
than inflation for both electric based heating/cooling and fossil fuel based
heating such as with natural gas. For instance, in Ontario, the cost to heat
and cool our homes with electricity has been increasing by 12-15% each year in
the last few years. This trend is expected to continue for the foreseeable
future. Natural gas had a few good years recently but increased dramatically in
April 2014 for residents of Ontario (+40%) and is also expected to continue
increasing faster than inflation.
The longer we use sources of energy that are not
sustainable, the more we will pay for it personally (to heat and cool our
homes) and environmentally with global warming’s devastating effects. 
We need to do something about it today, while we can still
make a difference.
THE PROBLEM
There are no affordable green options for home owners living
in locations where the temperature reaches below 0 degree Celsius. 
THE SOLUTION
After two and half years of research
& development, we are proud to have developed an innovative heating and
cooling system that can reduce the cost to heat and cool a home by up to 80%
(depending on various parameters like the location, orientation, etc.). The
best part is that our system is truly affordable for all home owners since:

There are no upfront costs

The
monthly savings are higher than the monthly cost for our system



Savings
start from day 1 (no more waiting for a payback then savings)

 THE SYSTEM
Our system uses
gravel to increase the efficiency of a heat pump, which looks like an Air
Conditioning unit but can both heat and cool your home. Thanks to the gravel,
the heat pump can work all year round, even in climates where the temperature
dips below zero degrees Celsius. Gravel is a great storage medium with
excellent heat retention properties. It is durable, widely available, and has a
low cost. The gravel reservoir is preferable installed under the foundations
during construction, and thus does not reduce available space such as a
basement. 
Here is how the system works:
During the winter cycle (see below), gravel
air is heated during the day as is passes through solar air heating panels. The warm air is
blown into the gravel and is used as needed. At night (or during the day), when
the inside temperature starts to fall, the heat pump is activated as needed to
transfer the stored heat from the gravel to the house. This warms up the house,
and cools down the gravel. The cycle starts over the next day.
During the summer cycle (see below), fresh outside air is blown into the
gravel at night, cooling it down; during the day the heat pump is activated as
needed and uses the cooled gravel, making the heat pump run more efficiently.
This cools the house, and warms up the gravel. The cycle starts over the next
night.Our system also
offers lots of other benefits. For more information about it you can visit our
website at www.thermasolaris.com and/or contact us
atfounders@thermasolaris.com
WHY WE ARE CROWDFUNDING
After our successful simulations and physical
lab testing done last year at the Brunsfield Centre, University of Ottawa (see
picture below), we are now at a critical stage where we need your financial
support to build, test, and have 3rd party validation of a small
scale prototype.In the past 6 months, we’ve found a
location for our Small Scale Prototype, established academic partners in Ottawa
(Carleton University and La Cité) and have found sources of financing to take
care of about $66,000 of the funds needed for this $76,000 project. We are
seeking your help to raise the remaining $11,000 (including Indiegogo fees)
needed to ensure this project is a success. 
WHAT WE PLAN TO DO WITH THE MONEY
Our plan after crowdfunding is to build
and test the small scale prototype. Then, once we are satisfied with the
results, we plan to raise capital from strategic partners or Angel Investors in
order to grow the business at a faster pace. Our goal is to start selling our
system by the end of 2015.
Your contributions will be used to pay
for the two heating and cooling systems that will be installed in the two small
structures that will be built at La Cité.
If we are left with some excess cash at
the end of this project, it will go towards funding the full scale prototype we
have already secured for the spring of 2015 (more information in the next
section).
Below is the budget and planned schedule
for this project:
OUR STRETCH GOALS


Stretch
goal #1: with $46k
($11k + $35k) we will leverage the money with a government program (1:1 match)
to fund the full scale prototype that we have already secured for the spring of
2015. The full scale prototype unit will be installed in a model home in
Ottawa, Ontario, and be open for visits from the public.
Stretch goal #2: with $126k we will develop one add-on
to enhance our system (more information will be available if we reach the
$46,000 stretch goal…)
ABOUT US

Pengarna från denna insamling kommer att gå till att avlöna en person som bemannar ett kansli de sista 6 veckorna innan riksdagen. Det kommer att behövas! Stort TACK för alla gåvor, stora som små!!Vad vi behöver och vad du får
En heltidsanställd kommer att kosta 35000 i månaden - 25000 i månaden före skatt + arbetsgivaravgift. För sex veckor kommer vi alltså att behöva 52000 kr.Perks: 300 kr eller mer - vi skickar den här bilden, utskriven på fint papper och signerad av konstnären själv!Om vi inte når målet, så kommer pengarna att gå till att bekosta en kanslist för den tid vi klarar av att täcka ekonomiskt!Resultat
Du bidrar till demokratin, och en bättre värld. Världen ändras inte främst av stora ledare, även om det är dem som vi kommer ihåg; utan av många människor som organiserar sig och tillsammans jobbar mot högre mål. Vår förhoppning är att vi kan ge politikerna en förståelse för att de har ett brett folkligt stöd för att ta itu med klimatproblemet.Andra sätt att hjälpa till

<h2>The world's problem is our problem:</h2>
<h3><strong>Roughly <em>a third</em> of world's food production is thrown away every year.</strong></h3>
<p>This is a  horribly large percentage considering the countless people seriously suffering from food shortage. Calculating per household, this comes down to 600$-750$ worth of groceries each year, as much as a small family vacation or food for several months (depending on local prices)!</p>
<p><img alt=""you can avoid this!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2009/9/29/1254242789592/Food-waste-illustration-001.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""You can avoid this!""/></p>
<p>We should not need to tell you this, but most likely<strong> it also happens in your home!</strong> Think about every time you buy something in bulk because it is cheaper or you cook too much and keep it in the fridge until you're not sure whether it's still good or not and you throw it out just to be sure.</p>
<p>Best-before -or worse- sell-before dates are indirect and inaccurate. They are mere guarantee certificates from the producers for a certain feature of the food, for example creaminess in yoghurt. Most food is still safe to eat and perfectly tasty after the best-before date.</p>
<p><strong>There is the other side:</strong> What if you transport your groceries in a warm car or they stay out of the fridge a few hours or a night? You don't know whether your food still safe to eat! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>I bet you don't remember your last case of food poisoning!</strong></h3>
<p>Many cases go undisclosed because people think the rumbling is 'just a stomach ache' or that they are 'sensitive', but it's unpleasant and sometimes embarassing anyways. I think I don't have to tell you about the more severe cases caused by meat or eggs that were less than at their best.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>There is a solution!</h2>
<p>As Scientists, our goal is to develop a detection and report system in the form of a <strong>easy-to-use sticker</strong> that tells you whether your food is still safe to eat, independently from date or time, by direct measurement and a <strong>color indicator</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt=""Simple as that, bend the sticker, put it in the same container (plastic bag/box) as the food and it will tell you when the food isn't safe to eat anymore!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://2012.igem.org/wiki/images/d/d4/Groningen2012_RR_20120713_paintpicture.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""The concept""/></p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Don't worry, the sticker will be smaller than that!</p>
<p>The <strong>food-safe</strong> (safe to ingest) bacteria are contained in a compartment of the sticker in their hibernated form and the activation fluid in the second compartment. By thoroughly bending or massaging the sticker like a glow stick you will break the inside compartment and activate the sticker. When you put it close to your food, for example in the same plastic bag or box it will <strong>change it's colour when the food is not edible anymore</strong>.</p>
<p>We are trying our best to make the sticker <strong>re-useable</strong>. Because meat has the most energy consuming production process of all foods, <strong>we focus on meat spoilage detection for the first prototype</strong> as for proof of principle.</p>
<p>Apart from the protective hightech polymer mesh that stabilizes the outer layer of the sticker, the bacteria cannot survive outside of the sticker, which makes the system safe to use. The plastic will be a membrane which is transmissive for gasses but not fluids, so nothing can escape.</p>
<p>The design of the Biological process for this is the hardest part because we will work with a special strain of food-safe bacteria in which we will implement a complex Biosensensing system, a reporter system and a safety-switch. All these parts will be standardized (interchangeable, safe and easy-to use) so others can  pick up our research and develop our idea further.</p>
<h3>We will not earn any money with this, it is purely about taking a successful first step in research and building a prototype!</h3>

Climate Presenter. I’m also a science teacher, having spent more than 20 years
working in the L.A. public school system and now serving as a science expert at
the San Pedro Science Center. I love what I do! 
I would like to ask for
your help to defeat climate deniers and reveal the truth about the climate
crisis.
I became interested in climate change
through my role as a science educator and became especially motivated to make a
difference when I participated in a taping of a presentation by Al Gore that
was shown in An Inconvenient Truth. After
the documentary was released, I was selected and personally trained by Mr. Gore
to deliver the same climate slideshow presentation to people within my network.

Over the years I’ve given the slideshow
presentation innumerable times, yet one really stands out. I gave a presentation at my
alma mater West Liberty State College (now University) in West Virginia. In a
coal mining state like West Virginia, I was a little nervous to talk about the
need to transition off of dirty coal and illustrate the environmental damage
done by the mountaintop leveling that takes place in the southern part of the
state. I received a very positive response and actually got my first standing
ovation. This presentation gave me more confidence to give presentations
outside my usual comfort zone of preaching to the choir around Los Angeles and
in classrooms.
People often ask me what my motivation is to spend so much
time educating people about the climate crisis. That’s easy – my motivation is
the youth of today. I have seen young people learn, get excited and get involved
in making the world around them a better place. To see the light bulb go on
when a student understands and gets it, that’s my motivation. I have been
privileged to work with some of the most amazing, motivated young people in the
world. They are why I keep doing what I’m doing.
On September 15, I’ll be participating in the
24 Hours of Reality event, created by The Climate Reality Project and Al Gore.
24 Climate Presenters from around the world, one in every time zone, will
deliver a new slideshow from Mr. Gore that focuses on the link between extreme
weather and climate change. 
I’ll be presenting this slideshow in Boulder,
Colorado, home of 7 federally funded research facilities including the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Center
for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). With world-class research underway on a wide
range of topics, Boulder is a focal point for climate and weather-related scientific
research today. 
I hope you’ll “tune” in.
The slideshow is fantastic and I can’t wait to share it.   
Why I’m asking:
Since
2006, Al Gore has trained more than 3,000 volunteer activists like me from
around the world to deliver updated versions of the slideshow featured in An Inconvenient Truth. These Climate
Presenters have delivered more than 70,000 climate presentations and reached a
global audience in excess of 7.3 million people! 
Climate
Presenters are on the front-lines, educating people around the world at a
peer-to-peer level every day about the science and impacts of climate change,
and they are helping us expand the global movement of people working together
to solve the climate crisis.  
I’d
like to ask for your contribution of $25 or more to support Climate Reality’s efforts to continue to train
Climate Presenters. With
your gift, you’ll help Climate Presenters like me give presentations
all over the world, building a movement of people who care about climate
change. Plus, your donation will be tax-deductible if it is made via PayPal. 

More about me:Education is my life. In addition to
being a Climate Presenter with The Climate Reality Project, I’ve also been
involved in a variety of environmental education programs.  I received an American Teacher Award as
one of the top three science teachers in the country and was awarded the Global
Leadership Award in Education by the Jane Goodall Institute. I also run a 3 ½
acre urban garden that showcases food sustainability.  
More information about the 24 Hours of Reality event, from
The Climate Reality Project:
Spanning 24 hours, 24 time zones and 13
languages, 24 Hours of Reality features a new multimedia presentation
from Vice President Al Gore that will make the reality of climate change
impossible to ignore. This new presentation will be delivered by Vice President
Gore and an elite corps of Climate Presenters from around the world, including
Evan Williams from the U.K. 

Beginning in Mexico City on September 14 and proceeding westward around the
globe, 24 Hours of Reality will offer a snapshot of the global climate crisis from
Tonga to Cape Verde, Auckland to Rio, Jakarta to London. With one event
scheduled in each time zone at 7 p.m. local time, the entire 24 hours will be
streamed live online and will include commentary from scientists, elected
leaders, business leaders, celebrities and activists.

<p>I have been chosen as one of the members of the Antarctic Youth Ambassador Programme to attend the International Antarctic Expedition.The mission is to engage people to take responsibility, be sustainable, and know that now is the time for action in policy development.</p>
<p>I am dreaming of being able to see Antarctica’s pure and untouched nature with my own eyes and truly feel how vulnerable our planet is. Having experienced this, I want to pass this feeling on to the rest of the world through my writing in order to activate people around the world to work together towards a healthy earth. Please help me raise enough money to make this possible.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Who am I?</strong></p>
<p>My name is Bella Papadopoulou Dobrowolska and I am an environmental journalist. A couple of years back I randomly read a quote that got stuck in my mind. The quote was simple and yet so powerful to me and it said ”if you can imagine it, you can make it”.</p>
<p>It is easy to dream away about a clean and healthy planet but I don’t want to stop at the imagination part, I want to actually make it happen. In 2010 I studied Environmental journalism in Australia and after that I have been traveling around the world in order to be involved in various environmental and sustainable projects. Up until today I have been part of all in between observing how the native islanders in Fiji respond to the raising of the water level, to installation of water filters in poor communities.</p>
<p>Being a journalist I have been working hard on raising attention and awareness regarding various environmental problems because I am certain of the fact that a major part of this global environmental issue is simply the lack of knowledge about it.</p>
<p>I am running a news site called ”Ecology Now” where I publish articles in this exact matter. In the meantime I am traveling to countries around the world talking about the global impacts on our environment, our home, to children in schools and other institutions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why should you sponsor me?</strong></p>
<p>But to be passionate about the environment is not always enough in order to make a change. I believe that the most important qualities needed in a ”world-changer” are two: communication and stubbornness. To be able to get your message through is easy, to actually make it heard is an art. An art that I have learned to master after many years of journalistic behaviour. Being fluent in 6 different languages (Swedish, Greek, Polish, English, Spanish and Portuguese) has made it easier to reach out to a wider audience as well.</p>
<p>In order to achieve great things people need to gather, share and combine their abilities to create a strong and solid group that can create and act. As a part of this team of 2041, I believe that my comminication skills and my international access to press as a journalist will be in great favour and contribution.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What will you get back!</strong></p>
<p>We are living in hectic times where the lack of time is a crucial issue for all of us. This is why I want to dedicate all of mine in order to make changes – even if they are small – that will benefit on everyone’s behalf.</p>
<p>Today, it is very important to take care of the environment, especially for businesses. By sponsoring me, a young person that is commited to protecting the valnurable Antarctica, it definately shows that the bussiness cares about the environment, the society and that it supports active youngsters. I am currently seeking sponsorship for the expedition of amounts of $1,000.00 or more as the expedition costs $20,000! In return for sponsorship You would have Your companys logo placed on the expedition website and facebook page, as well as promoted via twitter as well as appear on all of the photos and a documentary film that will be shown in the international press by Robert Swan (OBE) that is very well known and respected in international media. This high res image will be provided to you to use in all marketing materials and on your website to further demonstrate that the company is supportive and caring of solving environmental issues.</p>
<p>Antarctica holds 90% of the world’s ice and 70% of the world’s fresh water. This is why it is in everyone’s interest to protect it.</p>
<p>Human activities in Antarctica are governed by an international agreement known as the Antarctic Treaty System, established in 1959. This unique international agreement ensures that Antarctica is used for peaceful purposes only and that the environment is protected. Currently there is a moratorium in place that bans drilling or mining in Antarctica called the Environmental Protocol, established in 1991. This document can be reviewed after the 50-year anniversary in 2041. With all the changes in the world today, it is crucial to make sure that this agreement will be re-voted in order to keep Antarctica protected from political interests. </p>

<p><strong>What will your contribution pay for?</strong></p>
<p>The Expedition Fee includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three nights pre-expedition hotel accommodation with breakfast</li>

<li>Leadership throughout the voyage by our experienced Expedition Leader, including shore landings and other activities</li>

</ul><p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What happens when I come back from Antarctica? </strong></p>
<p>I am currently living in a small town in the northeast of Brazil called Itacaré. While the tourism has kicked in pretty well here, there is still large part of the community living in poor neighborhoods of the nearby “favela”.</p>
<p>When I come back from Antarctica I would like to start a project to introduce these families to solar cooking. The location of this part of town is located on a hill and all of the houses have flat and sun-exposed rooftops. Bahia, which is the state where Itacaré lies in, is a place where the sun hardly ever hides behind the clouds so I want to take advantage of this by introducing solar cooking to the community.</p>
<p>“Feijoada” is a traditional Brazilian dish that is eaten everyday for lunch and is mainly made up of beans, something that take a long time to cook and waists a lot of gas and energy in order to be prepared. In Itacaré there is a voluntary organization called “Ponho Forte” where children in between the ages of 4-18 take place in various educational activities. Together with this NGO I would like to teach these children about why it is important to be sustainable and they loved the idea.</p>
<p>Having made the educational part of this, I want each and every student to make their own solar cooking-device (such as an oven made out of mirrors or turn a tinfoil-covered umbrella into a place to cook their beans on). I will spend 1-2 months focusing on the educating part and the philosophy behind solar cooking before making the workshop because I believe that it is very important to make these children aware of the impacts of energy wasting in order for them to make the devices with full consciousness. I aim to include around 100 students in this project, which will mean that 100 households will make solar cooking as part of their daily food preparation. I am certain of the fact that this in time will encourage many others to solar cook as well, especially as they will have a chance to save money on gas and electricity.   </p>

</div></div>","90% of Kenyans use firewood and charcoal to cook, resulting in deforestation, climate warming, and deaths. 

GreenChar is transforming Kenya through its eco-friendly and smokeless charcoal briquettes that curb deforestation, reduce CO₂-related emissions, and save lives. 


Kindly see below for information on the following: (I) GreenChar's story, (II) the current social problem, (III) GreenChar's solution, (IV) notable awards and recognition, (V) the impact of your donation, and (VI) what you can do to help. 


I. The Story

 




Household air pollution caused by cooking with firewood and charcoal is the greatest health risk in the world after high blood pressure, tobacco, and alcohol. 
Last December, 18 year-old Tom Osborn founded GreenChar. Tired of lighting the family cookstove everyday and seeing his mother take in a slow poison while cooking, he started making charcoal briquettes from agricultural wastes for women like his mother and children like him in Kenya. 
With the mission to provide affordable clean energy solutions to Kenyans, Tom and his amazing team are ready to take GreenChar to the next level and usher in the new era of clean kitchens for Kenyan households.


II. The Problem
90% of Kenyan households like Tom's use wood fuels (charcoal and firewood) to cook. Indoor air pollution from these wood fuels has resulted in :



4.3 million deaths each year
70% of black-carbon emissions, the second leading cause of climate warming

Continuous deforestation at a rate of 130,000 acres of forest cover per year

Unhealthy, unclean kitchens, which make cooking an unenjoyable experience

More people die from incremental, ongoing inhalation of smoke from their own homes than from malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS combined.



III. Our Solution
GreenChar is a social enterprise that provides clean charcoal briquettes made from revitalized agricultural wastes and distributes clean cookstoves.
GreenChar's charcoal briquettes are :


Eco Friendly - curbs deforestation by using revitalized agricultural wastes

High Energy - can be used to cook a wide variety of foods


Smokeless - reduces the risk of harmful respiratory diseases 

Long lasting - reduces overall fuel costs for ordinary Kenyan families 



GreenChar distributes clean cookstoves that optimize the efficiency of the briquettes.The cookstoves reduce smoke and particle emissions, retain more heat and reduce fuel costs to provide families with the ultimate clean cooking experience.


Combined, these complementary products provide a complete household cooking environment, saving lives, money, and time.
Since last December, GreenChar has sold 4,300kg of eco-friendly charcoal briquettes, distributed over 400 clean cookstoves, saved over 100 trees, and impacted 6,000 lives.  


IV. Notable Awards and Recognition 

Below are a list of GreenChar's awards, recognitions, and notable articles. 
Awards:


Echoing Green Fellowship- GreenChar is one of 42 Echoing
Green Fellows’ organizations. GreenChar will receive seed funding along with business and leadership support for a span of two years.


Donor's Circle Award for Africa- Awarded by the Silicon Valley Foundation at Anzisha Prize Awards Gala organized by the African Leadership Academy and the MasterCard Foundation.

<h3>Bridging the gap between an existing zero waste network and those who choose to take action.</h3>
<p>We take responsibility to create a zero-waste network in Europe by starting our Zero Van Europe Tour.</p>
<p><strong>HERE IS A BIT ABOUT US </strong><br/>We are two young women from very different backrounds and cultures, combining all of our knowledge and passion to serve one purpose: <strong>making it easy for you to go zero waste !</strong><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619535096/dbiepkawxddheveips0l.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefaniebehrendt/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Stefanie</a>  is a zero-waste consultant based in Amsterdam, living and endorsing an eco-friendly way of living for more than 8 years. What drives her ? Her love to nature !<br/><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/elifgerek/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Elif </a>wants people to experience a reconnection to what really matters. If you are ready to challenge yourself,  she is ready to support you.</p>
<p><strong>WHY WE ARE DOING WHAT WE DO </strong><br/>Europe already offers an existent Zero Waste network. And we want to make it visible.</p>
<p>That's why we chose 5 cities this year to begin with - creating maps of sustainable businesses that everyone can access:</p>
<ul>
<li>May: <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?hl=en&amp;mid=1DK5fJZ94pGScrz6IU2G-b_kDAbuonkg6&amp;ll=37.95438348874005%2C23.74681889999998&amp;z=11"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Athens, Greece </strong></a>
</li>
<li>June: <strong>Berlin, Germany</strong>
</li>
<li>July: <strong>Oslo, Norway</strong>
</li>
<li>August: <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?hl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;mid=1gJLhvVGKDXTvsoZOslWrB8U-nsieWlsX&amp;ll=52.34528812742569%2C4.845884349999996&amp;z=11"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Amsterdam, Netherlands</strong></a>
</li>
<li>September: <strong>Lisbon, Portugal </strong><br/> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHAT WE ARE DOING </strong></p>
<p>We already identified over <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?hl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;mid=1gJLhvVGKDXTvsoZOslWrB8U-nsieWlsX&amp;ll=52.34528812742569%2C4.845884349999996&amp;z=11"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">340 shops that align with a Zero Waste lifestyle in Amsterdam</a>. The selected stores allow for easy changes to a Zero Waste lifestyle, yet the awareness is missing. We are bridging the gap between the already existent Zero Waste infrastructure and those willing to take action with our <a href=""https://www.wegozero.co/zero-waste-map/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">zero waste maps</a>.</p>
<p>Highlighting these spots makes going Zero Waste easy and helps small businesses to thrive. Thus spreading awareness and supporting local shops as we create a community.</p>
<p><strong>HOW WE ARE DOING IT </strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619534378/rtylcuovoe8evfypwnwg.jpg"" src=""""/></strong><br/>We first localize businesses like <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/treasurehousevintage/?fbclid=IwAR1wJ4l5IGYgbsGSmpMGjMIGLxvvlVvMnuk0D2W9Ow-yvRU-0uGEm9LSnkc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Treasurehouse</a> that align with the values of a Zero Waste lifestyle, making it easy for the consumer to find. And then categorise those businesses with coloured labels according to their current status quo (% of Zero Waste potential fulfilled). This makes the current practice visible and increases additionally the will for a business to commit to an even higher Zero Waste practice.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we connect to the business owners and their stories to further engage the community with local stores. Along the process, we guide the businesses interested into a more Zero Waste practice and at the same time we make it easy for consumers to change their consumption pattern.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IF YOU HELP US DOING IT ? </strong><br/>You save your own ass. We connect people who do good for the world and help them create a bigger environmental impact. In numbers that means our tour has the potential to influence over 6 million people in 5 european cities.<br/><br/>Cities are responsible for the biggest share of carbon emissions. By engaging urban customers into changes in behaviour and mindset, we have a great chance of achieving significant positive indirect impact.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>Alright, let's speak about the hard facts. </strong></p>
<p><strong>THIS IS WHAT WE NEED TO GET IT ROLLIN'</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Electric Camper Van:    € 30.000,-</strong><br/>An <a href=""https://www.vwkampers.co.uk/vw-danburys-for-sale/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">electric camper van</a>, serving as our carbon neutral home, rolling office and mobile spreading the word device. </li>
<li>
<strong>Marketing Budget:         € 10.000,- </strong><br/>A marketing budget to help further grow our community of zero wasters on social media channels - includes printing of compostable stickers to categorise and pin businesses.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are completely transparent with our costs and invite everyone to have a look into our accounting books.</p>
<p>What we are contributing from our own pockets are our monthly fixed costs of about € 1000,- and all the women power we have. While we are connecting to businessowners and individuals ourselves, we are simultanously able to code and develop a zero waste networking platform.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>SO, WHAT'S IN FOR YOU ? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Here is what you will get for your contribution to a bright &amp; clean future ! </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<u><a href=""https://www.wegozero.co/local-services/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Zero Waste Bike Tours</a>:</u> Join one of our zero waste bike tours to solve a few questions around the myths of a Zero Waste lifestyle being inconvenient, expensive, timely and not accessible.</li>

<p>If we partly reach our goal, we have won already - we have more than we had in the beginning of our tour and will be able to make a bigger impact.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Impact</h3>
<p>The maps we are creating are data-driven solutions and have thus the potential to be scaled up and benefit the many. Since the creation of our zero waste map Amsterdam we already had over 3.000 views without promoting it particularly. The map and the network has the potential to be implemented in every major city around the world, strengthening consumers and businesses in their will to a Zero Waste life.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619537769/cztqvzxz1y2adc7tvzsj.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our Website can easily run for several cities. Ideally, each city would have a local consulting agency or ambassador who would be a contact point to ensure each business knows which steps to take to a more sustainable business practice. In collaboration with <a href=""https://www.wegozero.co/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">wegozero.co</a> could we ensure that the criteria for each city stays the same, to allow for comparability among cities. Once again, connecting, embracing and strengthening the local, sustainable network.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Did you know that 61% of the Millennials would like to live a more sustainable lifestyle? Whilst many believe it is important to take care of the environment, only few people follow through. The problem is: it is not made easy. Going for the better option typically involves a lengthy research leaving only the strong-willed to a Zero Waste lifestye.<br/><br/><strong>We close this Value-Action Gap and make it easy for everyone to transform their daily routine to a Zero Waste lifestyle.  </strong></p>
<p>But also we will face challenges and risks:</p>
<ul>
<li>What if our Van gets stolen ?</li>
<li>What if one of us gets sick ?</li>
<li>What if we take too much responsibility on our shoulders?</li>
<li>What if Covid restrictions get more strict and we won't be able to travel ?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where we have trust in you and hope for the support of the community that we create. And this is what we wish for everyone that is part of our network. Creating a base of trust and transparency.<br/> </p>

</div><p>And this is all for now. Questions ?</p></div>","Bridging the gap between an existing zero waste network and those who choose to take action.
We take responsibility to create a zero-waste network in Europe by starting our Zero Van Europe Tour.
HERE IS A BIT ABOUT US We are two young women from very different backrounds and cultures, combining all of our knowledge and passion to serve one purpose: making it easy for you to go zero waste !Stefanie  is a zero-waste consultant based in Amsterdam, living and endorsing an eco-friendly way of living for more than 8 years. What drives her ? Her love to nature !Elif wants people to experience a reconnection to what really matters. If you are ready to challenge yourself,  she is ready to support you.
WHY WE ARE DOING WHAT WE DO Europe already offers an existent Zero Waste network. And we want to make it visible.
That's why we chose 5 cities this year to begin with - creating maps of sustainable businesses that everyone can access:

May: Athens, Greece 

June: Berlin, Germany

July: Oslo, Norway

August: Amsterdam, Netherlands

September: Lisbon, Portugal  

WHAT WE ARE DOING 
We already identified over 340 shops that align with a Zero Waste lifestyle in Amsterdam. The selected stores allow for easy changes to a Zero Waste lifestyle, yet the awareness is missing. We are bridging the gap between the already existent Zero Waste infrastructure and those willing to take action with our zero waste maps.
Highlighting these spots makes going Zero Waste easy and helps small businesses to thrive. Thus spreading awareness and supporting local shops as we create a community.
HOW WE ARE DOING IT 
We first localize businesses like Treasurehouse that align with the values of a Zero Waste lifestyle, making it easy for the consumer to find. And then categorise those businesses with coloured labels according to their current status quo (% of Zero Waste potential fulfilled). This makes the current practice visible and increases additionally the will for a business to commit to an even higher Zero Waste practice.
Furthermore, we connect to the business owners and their stories to further engage the community with local stores. Along the process, we guide the businesses interested into a more Zero Waste practice and at the same time we make it easy for consumers to change their consumption pattern.
WHAT IF YOU HELP US DOING IT ? You save your own ass. We connect people who do good for the world and help them create a bigger environmental impact. In numbers that means our tour has the potential to influence over 6 million people in 5 european cities.Cities are responsible for the biggest share of carbon emissions. By engaging urban customers into changes in behaviour and mindset, we have a great chance of achieving significant positive indirect impact. 

What We Need & What You Get
Alright, let's speak about the hard facts. 
THIS IS WHAT WE NEED TO GET IT ROLLIN'


Electric Camper Van:    € 30.000,-An electric camper van, serving as our carbon neutral home, rolling office and mobile spreading the word device. 

Marketing Budget:         € 10.000,- A marketing budget to help further grow our community of zero wasters on social media channels - includes printing of compostable stickers to categorise and pin businesses.

We are completely transparent with our costs and invite everyone to have a look into our accounting books.
What we are contributing from our own pockets are our monthly fixed costs of about € 1000,- and all the women power we have. While we are connecting to businessowners and individuals ourselves, we are simultanously able to code and develop a zero waste networking platform. 
SO, WHAT'S IN FOR YOU ? 
Here is what you will get for your contribution to a bright & clean future ! 


Zero Waste Bike Tours: Join one of our zero waste bike tours to solve a few questions around the myths of a Zero Waste lifestyle being inconvenient, expensive, timely and not accessible.

Zero Waste DIY Kit: did you ever wanted to produce your own shampoo, deo or toothpaste ? We have everything it takes - go zero with us !

Homemade zero waste products: Too lazy to do that ? Alright :-D ! We got you covered ! Try our self-produced zero waste products and fall in love with nature's gifts.

Individual Zero Waste Consultancy: Convenience, money and time standing in your way of becoming a zero waster ? We help you get started.


 


Are you living in one of our targeted cities ? Whoop ! We would love to visit you at home and turn your life into a zero waste zone.

Zero Waste Consultancy for your business: Time for change ? Let's make it happen ! We help your business integrate zero waste practices to its strategy. 

What happens, if we don't achieve the amount we wished for ? 
We will do it anyway - and if we have to go by bike with a tent on our backs - we won't let mother earth down!
If we partly reach our goal, we have won already - we have more than we had in the beginning of our tour and will be able to make a bigger impact. 

Our Impact
The maps we are creating are data-driven solutions and have thus the potential to be scaled up and benefit the many. Since the creation of our zero waste map Amsterdam we already had over 3.000 views without promoting it particularly. The map and the network has the potential to be implemented in every major city around the world, strengthening consumers and businesses in their will to a Zero Waste life.

Our Website can easily run for several cities. Ideally, each city would have a local consulting agency or ambassador who would be a contact point to ensure each business knows which steps to take to a more sustainable business practice. In collaboration with wegozero.co could we ensure that the criteria for each city stays the same, to allow for comparability among cities. Once again, connecting, embracing and strengthening the local, sustainable network. 

Risks & Challenges
Did you know that 61% of the Millennials would like to live a more sustainable lifestyle? Whilst many believe it is important to take care of the environment, only few people follow through. The problem is: it is not made easy. Going for the better option typically involves a lengthy research leaving only the strong-willed to a Zero Waste lifestye.We close this Value-Action Gap and make it easy for everyone to transform their daily routine to a Zero Waste lifestyle.  
But also we will face challenges and risks:

What if our Van gets stolen ?
What if one of us gets sick ?
What if we take too much responsibility on our shoulders?
What if Covid restrictions get more strict and we won't be able to travel ?

This is where we have trust in you and hope for the support of the community that we create. And this is what we wish for everyone that is part of our network. Creating a base of trust and transparency. 

Other Ways You Can Help

Some of you might not be able to contribute financially, but that doesn't mean you can't help:
In each city we are looking for volunteers, who can help us create a european zero waste network:

You can help us with mapping & marking the shops with zero waste potential with stickers
You can help us by becoming a zero waste bike tour guide
Make some noise about our campaign and share it on your social media channels

<h3>How will our gift wrap make a difference?</h3>
<p>By wrapping your second-hand gift in The Gift Rebellion gift wrap, you're reducing the production, packaging and shipping of one new thing. The gift wrap has been designed to help people feel comfortable about giving and receiving second-hand gifts. </p>
<p>We offset every sheet of The Gift Rebellion gift wrap with one tree planted and donate 50% of profits to tree planting and conservation.</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>Many people want to give second-hand gifts, because they know it's better for our environment, but they're scared of being judged. In the past, people have looked at second-hand things as dirty and worthless. The Gift Rebellion aims to change this attitude and give people another tool they can use to reduce their impact on our precious Earth.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We decided to make <strong>Dirt Rich</strong> while in the final stages of production on our award winning film <strong>Angel Azul</strong> after asking <strong>Dr. Thomas Goreau</strong> if there was any kind of machine that could vacuum carbon out of the air. Without hesitation he said, ""Yes, we have the perfect machine, and.... it's called, a tree! "" And with that he turned to point to a huge tree on the MIT campus and now, two years later, we are in the final stages of filming Dirt Rich! We are making this film because experts claim that we can literally reverse runaway global warming by practicing the strategies presented in the film within a very short timeframe. Your contributions help:</p>
<p>1- refocus public attention on drawing carbon down rather than simply concentrating on emissions</p>
<p>2- grasp regenerative agricultural/farming techniques that actually build soil</p>
<p>3- educate the public how soil is a living organism that feeds the world</p>
<p>4- reverse runaway global warming</p>
<p>5- pay for the music and graphics that distinguish this film and make it so enjoyable!</p>
<p>6- bring the film to high schools as a part of our Angel Azul Public School Outreach Progra</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This particular fundraising campaign is focused on paying our musicians and graphic artists! We need $15,000 to accomplish this goal! We need to raise funds and spread the word as it won't be long before we embark on our festival tour and we want to invite all of our Angel Azul fans to join us at film festivals!</p>

<h3>The Impact </h3>
<p>As environmental documentary filmmakers, our goal is to inspire and educate as many people as possible. To that end, with a grant from the <strong>Berkeley Film Foundation,</strong> we have been able to provide every public high school in the Bay Area with a copy of Angel Azul to use in classrooms, fundraisers, school screenings, and for use in their school libraries through our <strong>Angel Azul Public School Outreach Program</strong>. We believe that educating and inspiring students about how to live in the world more sustainably is extremely important. We will be adding <strong>Dirt Rich</strong> to our program upon its completion. We also plan to follow in the footsteps of Angel Azul with a full festival run lasting up to two years. Angel Azul won 12 awards and traveled to over 60 festivals and is now represented by <strong>EcoDox, </strong> and distributed by <strong>Gravitas Films</strong> making it available OnDemand and on local cable.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h3>Some Background Information About Us</h3><p>We are a small Ecuadorian-German company based in the region of the Amazon rain forest in Peru. Since childhood both the environment and global justice issues have been important topics to both of us which can be seen not only in our vegan diets but also in our work (both of us work in the e-mobility sector in Peru) and our engagement in NGOs (e.g. anonymous for the voiceless, save movement, B.U.N.D., Kifafa e.V.). Always wanting to help more and pursuing ideas with greater outreach we finally have the chance to contribute our part to the protection of the environment and to fight climate change while increasing social justice in a developing country and offering a healthy lifestyle that all social classes can afford. To be able to do so we need your help!</p><h3>Reforestation in Combination with Permaculture</h3><p>We are fortunate to own approximately 30 hectares of degraded farm land in the Amazon region of Peru. We want to use this land to create The Edible Forest through permaculture. The forest will provide all the food needed for those involved in the project and much more. From the surplus we intend to produce foods and sell these locally to begin with. The revenues will be used to keep expanding The Edible Forest and promoting this form of symbiotic agriculture.</p><p>The method we want to apply for our whole food production and distribution chain is based on the cradle to cradle concept by William McDonough and Michael Braungart which emphasizes on having a circular economy and working with materials that can either be 100% reusable or are 100% biodegradable. This includes: sustainable agriculture, food production and a self-sufficient energy system and water supply based on renewable energies.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529953600/hbsjmjy0l8vlpl1le6pk.png"" src=""""/></p><h3>Production of Cheap &amp; Healthy Foods</h3><p>The Edible Forest concept contains the whole cycle of food production: we grow all ingredients that can be grown in the climate of the Amazon region, create products out of them (i.e; plant-based cheese, milk and yogurt)  and sell these in Peru to establish a market of healthy foods as well as an awareness of health and dietary issues that so far unfortunately have not permeated to mainstream.</p><p>There is a big opportunity for Peru to enter the emerging and rapidly growing market of plant-based products which pulled in five billion US$ in sales in 2016. According to several food industry analysts there is an exponential growth of the plant-based sector expected in the coming years. Furthermore, a report compiled by market intelligence agency Mintel showed that products with a vegan claim increased by 257% since 2011. Peru has three different climate regions (coast, mountain region and tropical rain forest) and a large percentage of the raw materials used in plant-based meat, dairy and cheese substitutes are produced here, so their market potential is enormous.</p><p>It is very important to us that the prices of our products are as low as possible so that everybody can afford them, but of course without sacrificing the welfare of workers throughout the whole production chain. Some healthy plant-based products are already available in Peru (at least in Lima) but these are usually only accessible for middle to high class citizens due to their price. To make sure our prices will stay accessible is why we chose the method of vegan permaculture for our project and will enlist the help of volunteers who in return will be enriched by our know-how and experience a safe-space to escape the rush of the modern world. They will be able to stay at our farm for free and will be provided by with the food from our forest. In return we ask them to help us working in the fields or the production of our vegan food. Networks like wwoof.net or workandtravelperu.com will help us find these energetic volunteers.</p><h3>Environment and Social Justice Issues</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529948268/vqsjyhqii4yowzktmrla.png"" src=""""/></p><p>For us, as we both have lived in developed as well as undeveloped parts of the world, it is hard to see that people living in poorer countries have to suffer just because they were born in the ""wrong"" country. We want to make a change! By giving an example of how sustainable agriculture can work and that it is even possible to earn good money with it, we want to help local farmers to become independent from global markets or exploitative business agreements which too often leave the supplier or producer with just a fraction of the revenue. But to make it right, to be able to be an example, we need the infrastructure to do so. This is why we need your help. We want to build an ecological farm where the local workers and the volunteers can live and work under great conditions. As it is our aim to protect nature and the environment, we want everything to be sustainable and self-sufficient.</p><h3>Further Information</h3><p>The farm will be a combination of a garden and forest through permaculture with a living area in its center (see picture below). Here both workers and volunteers have a place to live and be comfortable. There is no need for high class housing, but at least everybody should have a roof above one's head and an own bed to sleep in, in a clean and safe place. The permanent workers (and their families) should of course have some kind of privacy, too. There also needs to be some common area where the people can cook and spend their free time.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531252201/il7deknxz5lnvk1n1llx.png"" src=""""/></p><p>This image shows a general guideline by which we want to set up a permaculture farm/garden. It has six zones of which four are used to grow food, one for housing and production of plant-based foods and the outermost zone is reserved for us to learn from nature and provide an undisturbed habitat for wildlife to return to.  </p><p>We want to build up tree houses since they offer a great chance to live in tune with nature. Furthermore we already made up a concept of ecological dry toilets which we want to install next to the tree houses. These neither pollute the soil nor the groundwater and even produce organic manure that can be used to fertilize the plants. Do not worry: dry toilets are absolutely sanitary and do not even smell.</p><p>As Pucallpa is located in the tropics it is useful to use the energy from the sun. Because of that we want to place solar panels on the roofs of the tree houses and have a backup generator (which would be used less and less as the solar panel system is enlarged) running on pure plant oil, which is carbon neutral. Water supply is not a problem either. The drinking water comes from a well and is cleaned with an activated carbon filter. For showering and laundry water there will also be tanks that collect and clean the rainwater. We do not want the people to use any shampoos or soaps or anything that may contain chemicals since we will use this water to irrigate the small gardens surrounding the tree houses and will therefore offer organic, biodegradable options for everyone to use.</p><h3>Perks</h3><p>In our decision-making we try to consider all three aspects of sustainability (social, ecological &amp; economical issues). Therefore our Perks cover these three topics. Depending on how much money you donate, you will receive different small to big objects made either by local people from Pucallpa, the communities around Pucallpa or an eco-friendly company in Europe. This means that by donating money to The Edible Forest you do not only help us to create an eco-effective form of agriculture and food production but also you contribute to some small companies and local artisans reaching an international audience. Our perks vary from ecological pencils to handmade bags with imprints typical of Pucallpa.</p><div>
<h3>What You Give &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Of course, what we are basically doing here is asking people for donations and their blind trust in us. We believe that crowdfunding is the best way to kick-start our project as soon as possible which is very important. Still, if we cannot manage to convince people to support us, we will give our best to create The Edible Forest on our own. This will of course take longer, but hopefully someday in the future we will get there either way. The reasons why we want to get it started as soon as possible are obvious: humans have created enormous problems for future generations through their exploitation of natural resources and of animals. We are on a path in which sticking to the business-as-usual scenario will not have a positive outcome. Climate is changing, the chasm between rich and poor is getting bigger and bigger all the time, currently about 815 million people suffer from hunger (not to mention all the animals that suffer in this world), people take refuge from their homes because of wars, climate, poverty and hunger or other conditions that cause them to abandon their families. The list goes on and on. Many of us (humans) do not realize that change is required and it needs to be right now or it might be too late. That is why it is so important for us to start with The Edible Forest immediately. If we manage to make a change, people could learn from us and a snowball effect could occur which will hopefully contribute to the world being a better place for future generations and non-human animals.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529953657/ngijrd2de8h3pdyqqzs3.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>To sum it all up: To get the whole farm set-up as described above (see Further Information), we need at least 120,000$. The expenses would be as follows:</p>
<p>- 35,000 US$ to build four tree houses (with sanitation rooms) to host the permanent workers, volunteers and have a common area (cooking, recreation etc.).</p>
<p>- 50,000 US$ for salaries for our team of five workers for a period of one year. The team consists of experts in reforestation and permaculture and professionals in the area of plant-based food production. Additional experts required can help us on a consultation basis or by volunteering.</p>
<p>- 10,000 US$ for small machinery with low energy demands to increase the efficiency of our plant-based food production.</p>
<p>- 10,000 US$ for a small oil press and a backup generator that runs on pure plant oil.</p>
<p>- 7,000 US$ for the solar energy and solar thermal collector systems.</p>
<p>- 8,000 US$ for plants and materials (for example: biodegradable banana fiber bags to plant the trees and shrubs in before transferring them to the land).</p>
<p>The funding is mainly to get us started. After the first year our concept will be established and we will have empirical data to show its economic viability and encourage private investors to see a great opportunity in The Edible Forest.</p>
<p>Therefore, as you can see, every cent we manage to bring in is just going to help us achieve a greater impact. If we do not manage to get the full amount we would start step by step and gradually create The Edible Forest with our savings. All the money we get will contribute to the reforestation of the Amazon region and the creation of a regenerative method of food production.</p>

<h3>The Outcome</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529948870/y5iwhk4c4hfwlnl7lf8m.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The first step will be to plant the carefully selected plants and trees (for example cashew, coconut, brazil nut, cacao, etc.) that provide each other with the most effective benefit and us with the fruits we need to produce our food. As soon as the plants yield fruits, these are harvested and the foods are produced. This is a lot of work and cannot be done by us alone. We therefore want to ask as mentioned before volunteers from all over the world for their help.</p>
<p>So far many raw materials growing in Peru are exported and the processed or finished products imported. Depending on what developed countries prefer, the small farmers grow their crops in hopes of being able to export their goods and get as much profit as possible. This means, for example, that if one year the international demand for cacao is high, many of the small farmers will be encouraged to grow cacao. The problem with this is that they don't have large extensions of farm land or any kind of machinery to cultivate, harvest and process the cacao so they end up selling the raw beans to a big company that pays the lowest possible price to increase their own profits. Also the cacao plants take three years to start producing and during this time the market could shift and the farmers are left with a mono-culture crop that has little to no demand.</p>
<p>With our concept of food production the farmers could grow not only one product but a variety of different products without the use of heavy machinery or intensive labor. This makes sure that they still can sell some of these even if the market of one particular product is low. Also, since the market for plant-based products is growing we will not be able to supply all the demand of vegan products with The Edible Forest. Therefore we want to create associations with the small farmers in order to help them create these products themselves or provide us with their raw materials for a fair price depending on what they prefer.</p>
<p>An additional benefit of The Edible Forest is that the farmers applying this method can be self-sufficient . This gives them at least the security that they and their families still have enough food even if a worst-case scenario occurs and nobody wants to buy any of the products.</p>
<p>We know that it is a lot of work, but we hope that there are some people out there who think like we do and do not only care about themselves, but also about people who have not been so lucky to be born in a wealthy society and that these people out there support us by donating money. We will give our best to return everything we have to the local communities in the Amazon region of Peru.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The plants and trees need time to grow and produce and also the infrastructure of the ecological farm is not built within a few days. Meanwhile there are many unforeseeable factors. For example due to climate change: heavy rainfalls or longer dry seasons could cause poor yields. These problems would be tremendous if we would use common agricultural practices, but luckily we do not intend to. In a permaculture garden these climate fluctuations cause less harm because we always have hundreds of different plants with different water and nutrient needs as well as higher or lower resistance to insects or fungus. This means, that there are always some species that will survive extreme weather conditions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have been working for over four years with native species in the Amazon region of Peru and for The Edible Forest we will also be working with two local experts with a combined experience of over 40 years in the areas of permaculture and reforestation.</p>
<p>Another problem could be that it is just not possible to create a market of vegan products in Pucallpa. This might be a heavy one, but since we are very flexible and also very confident that there is a growing market for plant-based food in Peru, we can adapt and expand our project to other cities. Of course, the production will always take place in the farm located near Pucallpa, but the finished products can be sent to Lima or other cities where people are already more aware about the benefits of a more plant-based diet.</p>

<h3>Further Ways to Support The Edible Forest</h3>
<p>We know that it is not always possible to donate money - even if it is just a small amount. No worries, you do also help us a lot if you tell others about our project. Maybe some of your friends or family members have some few dollars left to give to our revolutionary project. Visit our website (<a href=""http://www.v4vegan.de"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.v4vegan.de</a>), like and share our facebook page (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Revoluci%C3%B3n-Alimenticia-555611551490127/?rc=p"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/Revoluci%C3%B3n-Alimen</a>), use the Indiegogo platform to spread our ideas, but most importantly talk about our project! If you feel that together we can make a change and create a better world, share your enthusiasm with everyone you know and somehow we will achieve our crowdfunding goal and will be able to create The Edible Forest!!!</p>
</div></div>","Some Background Information About UsWe are a small Ecuadorian-German company based in the region of the Amazon rain forest in Peru. Since childhood both the environment and global justice issues have been important topics to both of us which can be seen not only in our vegan diets but also in our work (both of us work in the e-mobility sector in Peru) and our engagement in NGOs (e.g. anonymous for the voiceless, save movement, B.U.N.D., Kifafa e.V.). Always wanting to help more and pursuing ideas with greater outreach we finally have the chance to contribute our part to the protection of the environment and to fight climate change while increasing social justice in a developing country and offering a healthy lifestyle that all social classes can afford. To be able to do so we need your help!Reforestation in Combination with PermacultureWe are fortunate to own approximately 30 hectares of degraded farm land in the Amazon region of Peru. We want to use this land to create The Edible Forest through permaculture. The forest will provide all the food needed for those involved in the project and much more. From the surplus we intend to produce foods and sell these locally to begin with. The revenues will be used to keep expanding The Edible Forest and promoting this form of symbiotic agriculture.The method we want to apply for our whole food production and distribution chain is based on the cradle to cradle concept by William McDonough and Michael Braungart which emphasizes on having a circular economy and working with materials that can either be 100% reusable or are 100% biodegradable. This includes: sustainable agriculture, food production and a self-sufficient energy system and water supply based on renewable energies.Production of Cheap & Healthy FoodsThe Edible Forest concept contains the whole cycle of food production: we grow all ingredients that can be grown in the climate of the Amazon region, create products out of them (i.e; plant-based cheese, milk and yogurt)  and sell these in Peru to establish a market of healthy foods as well as an awareness of health and dietary issues that so far unfortunately have not permeated to mainstream.There is a big opportunity for Peru to enter the emerging and rapidly growing market of plant-based products which pulled in five billion US$ in sales in 2016. According to several food industry analysts there is an exponential growth of the plant-based sector expected in the coming years. Furthermore, a report compiled by market intelligence agency Mintel showed that products with a vegan claim increased by 257% since 2011. Peru has three different climate regions (coast, mountain region and tropical rain forest) and a large percentage of the raw materials used in plant-based meat, dairy and cheese substitutes are produced here, so their market potential is enormous.It is very important to us that the prices of our products are as low as possible so that everybody can afford them, but of course without sacrificing the welfare of workers throughout the whole production chain. Some healthy plant-based products are already available in Peru (at least in Lima) but these are usually only accessible for middle to high class citizens due to their price. To make sure our prices will stay accessible is why we chose the method of vegan permaculture for our project and will enlist the help of volunteers who in return will be enriched by our know-how and experience a safe-space to escape the rush of the modern world. They will be able to stay at our farm for free and will be provided by with the food from our forest. In return we ask them to help us working in the fields or the production of our vegan food. Networks like wwoof.net or workandtravelperu.com will help us find these energetic volunteers.Environment and Social Justice IssuesFor us, as we both have lived in developed as well as undeveloped parts of the world, it is hard to see that people living in poorer countries have to suffer just because they were born in the ""wrong"" country. We want to make a change! By giving an example of how sustainable agriculture can work and that it is even possible to earn good money with it, we want to help local farmers to become independent from global markets or exploitative business agreements which too often leave the supplier or producer with just a fraction of the revenue. But to make it right, to be able to be an example, we need the infrastructure to do so. This is why we need your help. We want to build an ecological farm where the local workers and the volunteers can live and work under great conditions. As it is our aim to protect nature and the environment, we want everything to be sustainable and self-sufficient.Further InformationThe farm will be a combination of a garden and forest through permaculture with a living area in its center (see picture below). Here both workers and volunteers have a place to live and be comfortable. There is no need for high class housing, but at least everybody should have a roof above one's head and an own bed to sleep in, in a clean and safe place. The permanent workers (and their families) should of course have some kind of privacy, too. There also needs to be some common area where the people can cook and spend their free time.This image shows a general guideline by which we want to set up a permaculture farm/garden. It has six zones of which four are used to grow food, one for housing and production of plant-based foods and the outermost zone is reserved for us to learn from nature and provide an undisturbed habitat for wildlife to return to.  We want to build up tree houses since they offer a great chance to live in tune with nature. Furthermore we already made up a concept of ecological dry toilets which we want to install next to the tree houses. These neither pollute the soil nor the groundwater and even produce organic manure that can be used to fertilize the plants. Do not worry: dry toilets are absolutely sanitary and do not even smell.As Pucallpa is located in the tropics it is useful to use the energy from the sun. Because of that we want to place solar panels on the roofs of the tree houses and have a backup generator (which would be used less and less as the solar panel system is enlarged) running on pure plant oil, which is carbon neutral. Water supply is not a problem either. The drinking water comes from a well and is cleaned with an activated carbon filter. For showering and laundry water there will also be tanks that collect and clean the rainwater. We do not want the people to use any shampoos or soaps or anything that may contain chemicals since we will use this water to irrigate the small gardens surrounding the tree houses and will therefore offer organic, biodegradable options for everyone to use.PerksIn our decision-making we try to consider all three aspects of sustainability (social, ecological & economical issues). Therefore our Perks cover these three topics. Depending on how much money you donate, you will receive different small to big objects made either by local people from Pucallpa, the communities around Pucallpa or an eco-friendly company in Europe. This means that by donating money to The Edible Forest you do not only help us to create an eco-effective form of agriculture and food production but also you contribute to some small companies and local artisans reaching an international audience. Our perks vary from ecological pencils to handmade bags with imprints typical of Pucallpa.
What You Give & What You Get
Of course, what we are basically doing here is asking people for donations and their blind trust in us. We believe that crowdfunding is the best way to kick-start our project as soon as possible which is very important. Still, if we cannot manage to convince people to support us, we will give our best to create The Edible Forest on our own. This will of course take longer, but hopefully someday in the future we will get there either way. The reasons why we want to get it started as soon as possible are obvious: humans have created enormous problems for future generations through their exploitation of natural resources and of animals. We are on a path in which sticking to the business-as-usual scenario will not have a positive outcome. Climate is changing, the chasm between rich and poor is getting bigger and bigger all the time, currently about 815 million people suffer from hunger (not to mention all the animals that suffer in this world), people take refuge from their homes because of wars, climate, poverty and hunger or other conditions that cause them to abandon their families. The list goes on and on. Many of us (humans) do not realize that change is required and it needs to be right now or it might be too late. That is why it is so important for us to start with The Edible Forest immediately. If we manage to make a change, people could learn from us and a snowball effect could occur which will hopefully contribute to the world being a better place for future generations and non-human animals.

To sum it all up: To get the whole farm set-up as described above (see Further Information), we need at least 120,000$. The expenses would be as follows:
- 35,000 US$ to build four tree houses (with sanitation rooms) to host the permanent workers, volunteers and have a common area (cooking, recreation etc.).
- 50,000 US$ for salaries for our team of five workers for a period of one year. The team consists of experts in reforestation and permaculture and professionals in the area of plant-based food production. Additional experts required can help us on a consultation basis or by volunteering.
- 10,000 US$ for small machinery with low energy demands to increase the efficiency of our plant-based food production.
- 10,000 US$ for a small oil press and a backup generator that runs on pure plant oil.
- 7,000 US$ for the solar energy and solar thermal collector systems.
- 8,000 US$ for plants and materials (for example: biodegradable banana fiber bags to plant the trees and shrubs in before transferring them to the land).
The funding is mainly to get us started. After the first year our concept will be established and we will have empirical data to show its economic viability and encourage private investors to see a great opportunity in The Edible Forest.

<p>Hello! My name is Alex Aguirre and I am a Boy Scout with Troop 841, Whittier.  I've been involved in scouting for  5 years.  After 5 years, I am now close to reaching Eagle Scout rank. One of my final requirements is to complete a project that gives back to the community.  The project I selected will benefit the Whittier
Public Library. I plan on updating old merit badge pamphlets, create a unique
display for them, and also install cork tiles to a wall. The cork tiles on the wall will be used to decorate and promote children book programs throughout the year. </p>
<p>This project is important to me as it will benefit any future scouts needing to work on merit badges and beautify the children's section of the library.</p>
<p>I will need to fund raise to pay for materials and supplies. I created
this campaign so anyone who would like to donate towards the cause may do
so at any time. Any amount would be greatly appreciated will help me complete the project and reach my goal of becoming an Eagle Scout. Thanks in advance!</p>

Hello! My name is Alex Aguirre and I am a Boy Scout with Troop 841, Whittier.  I've been involved in scouting for  5 years.  After 5 years, I am now close to reaching Eagle Scout rank. One of my final requirements is to complete a project that gives back to the community.  The project I selected will benefit the Whittier
Public Library. I plan on updating old merit badge pamphlets, create a unique
display for them, and also install cork tiles to a wall. The cork tiles on the wall will be used to decorate and promote children book programs throughout the year. 
This project is important to me as it will benefit any future scouts needing to work on merit badges and beautify the children's section of the library.
I will need to fund raise to pay for materials and supplies. I created
this campaign so anyone who would like to donate towards the cause may do
so at any time. Any amount would be greatly appreciated will help me complete the project and reach my goal of becoming an Eagle Scout. Thanks in advance!

 What We Need 
 My goal is to raise $600 for my project.  The project cost will be over $600, however I'm expecting the library to make a donation for the Merit Badge pamphlets. If the goal is not reached, I will still receive the donations made.  Purchase Merit Badge pamphlets
Purchase cork tiles for wall.  Purchase wood, paint and other material to make display case
Purchase miscellaneous supplies Purchase food & drink for my volunteer helpers (other hungry scouts) 
What You Get
Boy Scouts of America is a 501(c)3 organization. A donation made to Boy Scouts of America, Troop 841 may be a tax deductible donation.  Please consult with your tax adviser.
   The Impact The Whittier Library director is really excited about this project.  Enhancements to the library collection and engaging reading program decorations will benefit scouts and children using the libraries resources.
Other Ways You Can Help
 I understand if you are unable to make a financial donation.  You could also help by words of encouragement or sharing my fundraising campaign with others.

<div>With Conuco Solar, we plan to build and operate a solar farm aimed at reducing CO2 emissions and the national energy deficit of the Dominican Republic. Many people don’t have the space at their home or place of business to have their own solar panels installed. Our service will ensure that anyone can still have access to clean, renewable energy by essentially renting space at our solar farm, rather than having to set up their panels at home or their place of business where space may be limited. Our service is also a cost-effective alternative to the traditional and expensive electricity generated on the island and creates even more increased saving as using solar installations generates a credit on the electrical bill of our clients. Users pay a simple monthly fee for the maintenance of their panels and the rental of the land. The strategic location of our farm will help to reduce energy loses on the national grid, improving the electric service around the island.<br/>

To put it into perspective, each Mega Watt of solar panels installed equals the benefit of planting almost 20,000 trees. Our clients, primarily small businesses, but also homeowners, stand to save over 70% on the cost of electricity. This will reduce their operational costs and ultimately give small businesses a better chance to survive, thrive and protect the jobs they’ve created in the local community. </span><br style=""background-color: initial;""/></p>

<h3><u> Our Story</u></h3>
<p>James was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, a form of autism,  when he was 4 years old.  There have been many challenges in his life, but  21-year-old James has grown into an amazing young man with a strong desire to help the earth.  Together with his mom and his longtime aide, he started a small door-to-door recycling pick up service that has grown quickly and is now serving over 200 households.  James collects items that are not allowed in our city's curbside recycling program, such as plastic cups, take out containers, lids, straws, plastic bags, Styrofoam, etc., and takes them to companies that can recycle them.</p>
<p>With the state of the recycling market being so poor, a staggering amount of our country's plastic waste is ending up in the landfill.  However, we have an edge!   After hearing James' story, a local post-industrial plastic recycling company agreed to help us out.  They don't normally take post-consumer plastic, but they taught us how to properly clean, sort and shred plastic so that it is a valuable commodity for them.  They are committed to the success and growth of James' business and are enthusiastically behind our expansion plans.</p>
<p>We have a high demand for our service and know that it's time to grow.  Our plan is to open a recycling drop-off site and eventually expand our pick up service to more neighborhoods around our city AND to employ adults on the autistic spectrum (and other developmental disabilities).</p>
<p>We have even started a ""pilot"" program at a local school for kids on the autistic spectrum.  Several of their high school students collect recycling from families and staff and bring it to James to learn all about recycling.  When they graduate, they will be offered jobs at James' Recycling.</p>

<p><b>Who We Are</b></p>
<p>Abode Farm is a collective of young farmers, organizers, and artists working together to provide accessible local food and farm-based education and experiences to our community. Our 16-acre horse-powered farm supplies fresh produce to our CSA program, farmers markets, schools, food pantries, restaurants, and distributors.</p>
<p><strong>Our Project</strong></p>
<p>For seven years, we have used an unfinished barn—even on many cold winter days—to wash and distribute our farm produce. It's been our dream to create a space to host year-round farm-based educational programs and to expand our vegetable growing operation. By renovating the barn into the Abode Farm Center we will create a dynamic four-season space where food, ecology, and education come together. Achieving these goals will help stabilize our farm business and deepen our community work. </p>
<p>We need support to make this project become a reality! Your support for the Abode Farm Center will help create a regional resource for local food, education, and community.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552492446/a54nq5a4mj3d94itatn7.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>We are taking out loans for 60% of this project. </strong>Because we lease this barn, this project is not eligible for most capital improvement grants. <strong>We’ve set a financial goal of $25,000 and are seeking community support to help us with the remainder.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552939123/gyy3n9j4pgqzpxiuadi8.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>But the renovation requires a lot of materials and costs! We need to buy concrete, lumber, insulation, excavation equipment, climate control equipment, overhead doors, lights, hardware, electrical work, windows, doors, harvest bins, and washing equipment -- and pay contractors and laborers.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">With the completion of the Abode Farm Center, we will be able to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Utilize a cold-storage facility that will double our capacity to produce and distribute our vegetables </li>
<li>Expand our educational programming, offering more resources and opportunities to local youth, like our partners at <a href=""https://www.rootsrising.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Roots Rising</a>
</li>
<li>Create a community event space for workshops, farm celebrations, and performances</li>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Are Offering</strong></p>
<p>In exchange for your support, we have incredible rewards! We are offering beautiful postcards, T-shirts and tote bags designed by <a href=""https://mtlebanonresidency.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mount Lebanon Residency</a> artists . At higher tiers of support we are offering farm tours, sleigh rides, and personalized on-farm dinners.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Abode Farm is a place for anyone to visit and connect with the land. Creating the Abode Farm Center will extend our mission to more people and communities and create a regional resource for local food, education, community, and livelihood.</p>
<p>We have been operating the Abode Farm on a shoestring budget for seven years. The farm continues to struggle to make ends meet. As young farmers, we are working towards paying ourselves a living wage with the hope of making farming a reliable livelihood for years to come.</p>
<p>This is a pivotal moment for the farm — renovating the barn is the first step in ensuring our long-term financial sustainability. We have run the numbers, and we know that your support can truly help stabilize our business and make our farm thrive. Creating the Abode Farm Center is our biggest project to date and will have the most impact to our farm team and community, we hope you will support our project and help turn this dream into a reality!</p>

It's been our dream to create a space to host year-round farm-based educational programs and to expand our vegetable growing operation. By renovating the barn into the Abode Farm Center we will create a dynamic four-season space where food, ecology, and education come together. Achieving these goals will help stabilize our farm business and deepen our community work. 
We need support to make this project become a reality! Your support for the Abode Farm Center will help create a regional resource for local food, education, and community.


We are taking out loans for 60% of this project. Because we lease this barn, this project is not eligible for most capital improvement grants. We’ve set a financial goal of $25,000 and are seeking community support to help us with the remainder.

But the renovation requires a lot of materials and costs! We need to buy concrete, lumber, insulation, excavation equipment, climate control equipment, overhead doors, lights, hardware, electrical work, windows, doors, harvest bins, and washing equipment -- and pay contractors and laborers.
With the completion of the Abode Farm Center, we will be able to:

Utilize a cold-storage facility that will double our capacity to produce and distribute our vegetables 
Expand our educational programming, offering more resources and opportunities to local youth, like our partners at Roots Rising

Create a community event space for workshops, farm celebrations, and performances
House the Summer and Winter CSA distribution in a comfortable and inviting space 


 
What We Are Offering
In exchange for your support, we have incredible rewards! We are offering beautiful postcards, T-shirts and tote bags designed by Mount Lebanon Residency artists . At higher tiers of support we are offering farm tours, sleigh rides, and personalized on-farm dinners.
The Impact
Abode Farm is a place for anyone to visit and connect with the land. Creating the Abode Farm Center will extend our mission to more people and communities and create a regional resource for local food, education, community, and livelihood.
We have been operating the Abode Farm on a shoestring budget for seven years. The farm continues to struggle to make ends meet. As young farmers, we are working towards paying ourselves a living wage with the hope of making farming a reliable livelihood for years to come.
This is a pivotal moment for the farm — renovating the barn is the first step in ensuring our long-term financial sustainability. We have run the numbers, and we know that your support can truly help stabilize our business and make our farm thrive. Creating the Abode Farm Center is our biggest project to date and will have the most impact to our farm team and community, we hope you will support our project and help turn this dream into a reality!

<h3>Why We're Dancing</h3>
<p>Folks, we have some choices to make. Abundant lands &amp; waters in Hawaiʻi will either be a nostalgic, distant memory... or <b>something to MOVE for</b>! </p>
<p>Hawaiʻi's rural fishers &amp; farmers -- our <i>kuaʻāina</i> people -- are choosing to <i><b>move</b>.</i> Through KUA, they ally together in a grassroots movement for a better Hawaiʻi.</p>

We hope you'll check out our mahalo dance video here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPnVwJgSUfk

Let's Make Some Movement!
We are Kuaʻāina Ulu ʻAuamo (KUA), a movement-building organization supporting and connecting rural Hawaiian communities, restoring natural abundance to the islands we call home.For our 2014 fundraiser, we're throwing an all-paeʻāina (islands) online dance party -- and you're invited! Join mahi ʻai  (farmers) and lawaiʻa (fishers) around Hawai’i moving for the movement! 




Why We're Dancing
Folks, we have some choices to make. Abundant lands & waters in Hawaiʻi will either be a nostalgic, distant memory... or something to MOVE for! 
Hawaiʻi's rural fishers & farmers -- our kuaʻāina people -- are choosing to move. Through KUA, they ally together in a grassroots movement for a better Hawaiʻi.



Together, they rebuild fishponds, restore streams, grow food, and care for fishing grounds. Altogether this represents thousands of acres of Hawaiian lands and waters in grassroots community stewardship. 

We think it’s both hopeful AND dance-worthy. It needs your support. 


Our goal is to raise at least $5,000 + get at least 100 people dancing in a show of support during our All-Islands Online Paeʻāina Dance Party.
How It Works:
From now through December 31, 2014:

Click the pink ""contribute now"" button + make a tax-deductible donation! 


Donate $10 or more & we'll send you a gift for a free music download of your choice from Amazon.com. We also have some other great perks available to mahalo (thank); you can keep scrolling for more info below!


Do a dance, get down, boogie! Across the pae‘āina (islands), Hawaiʻi’s grassroots kua‘āina will be dancing in their places, celebrating the movement! In your shower, in your car, in your backyard with friends + family... wea-evah YOU stay... Turn up your song + get moving!
We'd love to hear what you're dancing to! Share your favorite dance song on our comment wall, or post a video of you and your favorite people cutting a rug on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter.

  
#paeainadanceparty2014  #KUAhawaii
We're compiling everyones favorite dance tunes into an All-Paeʻāina Playlist that you can listen to HERE or on Spotify! 

Community groups across Hawaiʻi will be sharing dance videos, photos and song picks under the hashtag #paeainadanceparty2014 over the next few weeks, so join in and show us your moves in support of a MOVEMENT for land, people, culture and justice! Check it out on:








How Your Gift Makes A Difference


The problems are real and pressing:
Hawaiʻi is the endangered species capital of the planet. There are more endangered species per square mile on these islands than any other place in the world. 

85% - 90% of what we eat is barged in, despite a wealth of resources for producing our own food.
86% of 55 native fish species included in a 2008 study were found to be depleted or below desirable levels.



Communities hold important solutions -- innovative, self-determined, and place-based. Yet their voices, needs and ʻike (knowledge) have historically been marginalized or even ignored. 


OUR MODEL OF IMPACT:

“One person standing alone has only one voice, and it’s not as strong as one hundred people standing together.” – Uncle Damien Kenison, Hoʻokena, Kamaʻāina United to Protect the ʻĀina (KUPA)

Your giving helps make it possible. Here are a few of our key initiatives for 2015:




Lawaiʻa Pono: Build impactful alliances between subsistence fishing communities, advancing Hawaiian traditions of lawai‘a--fishers caring for their fisheries & nearshore reefs.

Hoʻokua: Help skilled fishpond mahi i‘a (fish farmers) organize an “all-islands mobile workcrew"" with capacity to tackle larger restoration projects at fishponds, and teach and share their skills with others.

Limu Hui: Grow a new network of limu (native seaweed) gatherers & growers who support each other in restoring and protecting limu and limu practices.

SINCE 2003, KUA HAS:

A.  KUA means back -- like a backbone that connects and supports. KUAʻĀINA are the grassroots, rural peoples of Hawaiʻi nei. ULU means to grow. ‘AUAMO is the carrying stick held on multiple shoulders of laborers who shared the burden of carrying something of great weight forward. By taking up the ‘AUAMO, our KUAʻĀINA communities share the sacred kuleana (responsibility) to better Hawaiʻi.

Open Data for Open Lands 
An Unprecedented OpportunityMy name is Alyssa Ravasio, I helped found Access Land a year ago when I learned about an upcoming contract from the Federal Government that planned to give a single private company ownership of valuable data about our public land.I am proud to say that our coalition, which includes the Sierra Club, REI, and over 50 other outdoor organizations, has since succeeded in advocating for both the Federal Government and California State Parks to require open data in their contracts. This Fall, we’ve been invited to speak at the National Association of State Park Director’s Conference. This conference will bring together 30+ of the 50 State Parks Directors in the nation, creating an invaluable opportunity to explain the power of open data to those with the direct power to unlock it.Though we are an ad hoc coalition campaigning for open data, we are required to pay the standard $2K registration fee for the conference. The ImpactOpening park data to the private sector empowers any company or individual to build unique apps that will better connect the public to our land. These apps can reach a wider and more diverse demographic than any one company can alone (the current contracts create an effective data monopoly). Increased visitation to our parks will boost revenue for the government, local economies, and entire outdoor industry.As each state's contract expires, they have an opportunity to follow California and the Federal Government's precedent. But many states are hesitant to let go of their old systems and embrace this new platform of innovation.

</div><div>
<b>Awareness and motivate</b> people to stop <b>consuming shark</b> and <b>shark fin soup</b> . Spread the importance of sharks in our oceans to maintain the ecosystem. Show an alternative to the society as <b>ecotourism</b>; with it you can benefit economically without harming the environment . We hope that this <b>economic argument</b> inspire other countries to create <b>new protected areas</b>. Helping national parks or reserves where there's still hope to promote the exploitation of sharks by human hands. Working in the <b>legal field</b> to ensure that sharks are not tortured . Improving regulations and  with it get more protection of marine sanctuaries and heritage sites .<br/><h3><br/></h3>
</div><div>
<h3>We are going to film different areas in central America.</h3>
<div>We think eco-turism is the best way for everybody.</div>
<div>We are going to visit some places and dive centers ( partners of Nakawe Project) that use to see sharks during their dives.</div>
<div></div>
</div>Also we want to explore future collaborations and ways to help and protect places like COCOS ISLAND NATIONAL PARC,from the fishing sector, so threatening the biodiversity of this World Heritage Site.<div>

The oceans cover 71% of the surface of the Earth and are essential to the functioning of our planet. 
The mass capture of sharks, illegal in almost everywhere, produces extinction triggering a cascading effect behaving a reduction of oxygen on earth directly affecting all living beings including humans. 

"" As an organization one of our projects is to protect sharks, through awareness, education and action. We aim to be an international reference in the defense of sharks. ""
















 
SO LET'S...

Awareness and motivate people to stop consuming shark and shark fin soup . Spread the importance of sharks in our oceans to maintain the ecosystem. Show an alternative to the society as ecotourism; with it you can benefit economically without harming the environment . We hope that this economic argument inspire other countries to create new protected areas. Helping national parks or reserves where there's still hope to promote the exploitation of sharks by human hands. Working in the legal field to ensure that sharks are not tortured . Improving regulations and  with it get more protection of marine sanctuaries and heritage sites .

We are going to film different areas in central America.
We think eco-turism is the best way for everybody.
We are going to visit some places and dive centers ( partners of Nakawe Project) that use to see sharks during their dives.

Also we want to explore future collaborations and ways to help and protect places like COCOS ISLAND NATIONAL PARC,from the fishing sector, so threatening the biodiversity of this World Heritage Site.

My research as a graduate student at the University of Michigan focuses on water security in Brazil. This will be my second book, and most ambitious project yet (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Choose-Your-Health-Toward-Higher-ebook/dp/B00KYE7FT6"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">click here</a> to see my previous book, ""Choose Your Health,"" for sale on Amazon). I believe a plant-able coloring book will serve as an impactful, fun and transformative way to share the information we all need to know about water scarcity. None of the money we raise through your contributions will go towards me, or any of the time I spend on the project. All of it will go towards printing the book, and paying the artist who illustrates it, Rogério Fernandes.</p>
<p>Rogério Fernandes is a Brazilian visual artist from Belo Horizonte. Born in the state of Piauí, his work was greatly influenced by the woodcarving styles of the Brazilian northeast. His work can be found across the world. He believes that his fantastical and emotion-centered style will help readers connect with the subject matter and imagine how to create a new water-secure future. To learn more about Rogério's work, check out <a href=""http://rogeriofernandes.com.br/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">his website here</a>.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FOyTj9AY_Q6Q%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DOyTj9AY_Q6Q&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FOyTj9AY_Q6Q%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p>
</p><p><b><i>Quem Somos</i></b></p><p><i>O meu nome
é Kathryn Curtis e eu trabalho com a saúde, comida, e o meio ambiente. Eu
fiz uma pesquisa acadêmica para o meu mestrado na Universidade de Michigan
focado na segurança alimentar e sua relação com a seca no Brasil. Esse livro
será o meu segundo, e o projeto mais ambicioso até hoje (clique aqui para ver
o meu livro prévio, “<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Choose-Your-Health-Toward-Higher-ebook/dp/B00KYE7FT6"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Choose Your Health,”</a> no Amazon). Eu acredito que um livro
para colorir e plantar servirá como uma maneira impactante, divertido, e
transformativo para compartilhar a informação que precisamos saber sobre a
escassez d’água.</i></p>
<p><i>Rogério
Fernandes é um artista de Belo Horizonte. Nascido no Piauí, a obra dele é muito
influído pelas gravuras do nordeste. As obras dele estão espalhados pelo mundo

<p>In São Paulo, Brazil, city residents are thirsty. They dig wells in their back yard, drink dirty water, hoard what little they have. The Cantareira Reservoir System, which provides water to this enormous city, is drying up. But the problem isn't just in São Paulo - it's all across Brazil, and spreading fast. Water scarcity and water security affect us all. It is urgent that the public - not just experts or politicians - understand what is happening, and how to help. The image below is a concept illustration for the book that Rogério and I created with my writing and his visual wizardry, to give you an idea of what we plan to create together. </p><p>
</p><p><b><i>O que está acontecendo no Brasil?</i></b></p>
<p><i>“O povo aqui [em São Paulo] foi criado para
acreditar que a água é um recurso que nunca acabaria. Estamos tirando água das
fontes mais do que elas conseguem repor por métodos naturais.” Mara Cecilia
Brito, Aliança Pela Água</i></p>
<p><i>No São
Paulo, os cidadãos estão com sede. A Cantareira, que fornece agua para a
cidade, está se secando. Mas o problema não está somente no São Paulo – está
espalhado pelo Brasil inteiro, e a dificuldades estão aumentando rapidamente. A
escassez d’água nos afeta a todos. É urgente que o publico – não somente os
técnicos nem políticos – entendem o que está acontecendo, e como ajudar. </i></p><h3><br/></h3><h3>How You Can Participate</h3><p></p>
<p>This campaign will raise money to produce a plantable coloring book to build awareness about the who-what-where-when-and why of the issue, and invite readers to dream up a new future. It will be a book to stimulate the head and the heart, harnessing imagination and knowledge for the the common good. We'd like this message to travel far and wide, so the first 100 people to contribute $25 will receive it. </p>
<p>Your contribution will go towards supporting amazing art by Rogério, Portuguese translation, editing, binding, and publishing the books on the seed paper with some pretty incredible companies in the US and Brazil, and finally distribution. If the book is one day picked up by a publisher, we plan to donate many of the book sale proceeds to non-profits in Brazil working to re-forest the land, grow food sustainably, and support the construction of water catchment systems. If you'd like to see a more detailed break-down of costs, please scroll down to the bottom.</p>

<p><i>A campanha
vai juntar dinheiro num vaquinha para poder produzir um livro para colorir e
plantar. Esse livro vai ajudar a nos informar sobre o problema, e convidar
leitores a sonhar com um novo futuro. Será um livro para estimular a cabeça e o
coração, fortalecendo a imaginação e conhecimento para o bem comum. A gente
gostaria que viajasse longe esse livro, então os primeiros cem pessoas a
contribuir ao redor de R$100 (exatamente $25USD) vão receber o livro. O livro será imprimido em inglês e
português, dependendo do desejo da pessoa.</i></p>
<p><i>Sua contribuição apoiará o trabalho de Rogério, tradução do documento ao Português, edição,
encadernação do livro, impressão no papel semente, e distribuição. Se um dia o
livro é publicado por uma companhia profissional, pensamos em doar muito da
renda do livro a ONGs no Brasil lutando para re-florestar e apoiar as pessoas
sofrendo por falta d’água. Se você gostaria ver mais do orçamento, poder dar

My research as a graduate student at the University of Michigan focuses on water security in Brazil. This will be my second book, and most ambitious project yet (click here to see my previous book, ""Choose Your Health,"" for sale on Amazon). I believe a plant-able coloring book will serve as an impactful, fun and transformative way to share the information we all need to know about water scarcity. None of the money we raise through your contributions will go towards me, or any of the time I spend on the project. All of it will go towards printing the book, and paying the artist who illustrates it, Rogério Fernandes.
Rogério Fernandes is a Brazilian visual artist from Belo Horizonte. Born in the state of Piauí, his work was greatly influenced by the woodcarving styles of the Brazilian northeast. His work can be found across the world. He believes that his fantastical and emotion-centered style will help readers connect with the subject matter and imagine how to create a new water-secure future. To learn more about Rogério's work, check out his website here.
Quem SomosO meu nome
é Kathryn Curtis e eu trabalho com a saúde, comida, e o meio ambiente. Eu
fiz uma pesquisa acadêmica para o meu mestrado na Universidade de Michigan
focado na segurança alimentar e sua relação com a seca no Brasil. Esse livro
será o meu segundo, e o projeto mais ambicioso até hoje (clique aqui para ver
o meu livro prévio, “Choose Your Health,” no Amazon). Eu acredito que um livro
para colorir e plantar servirá como uma maneira impactante, divertido, e
transformativo para compartilhar a informação que precisamos saber sobre a
escassez d’água.
Rogério
Fernandes é um artista de Belo Horizonte. Nascido no Piauí, a obra dele é muito
influído pelas gravuras do nordeste. As obras dele estão espalhados pelo mundo
inteiro. Ele acredita que o seu estilo fantástico e emocional pode ajudar os
leitores conectar com a historia e imaginar como criar um futuro melhor. Para
aprender mais sobre o trabalho de Rogério, viste o site dele aqui.

What's Happening in Brazil?
In São Paulo, Brazil, city residents are thirsty. They dig wells in their back yard, drink dirty water, hoard what little they have. The Cantareira Reservoir System, which provides water to this enormous city, is drying up. But the problem isn't just in São Paulo - it's all across Brazil, and spreading fast. Water scarcity and water security affect us all. It is urgent that the public - not just experts or politicians - understand what is happening, and how to help. The image below is a concept illustration for the book that Rogério and I created with my writing and his visual wizardry, to give you an idea of what we plan to create together. 
O que está acontecendo no Brasil?
“O povo aqui [em São Paulo] foi criado para
acreditar que a água é um recurso que nunca acabaria. Estamos tirando água das
fontes mais do que elas conseguem repor por métodos naturais.” Mara Cecilia
Brito, Aliança Pela Água
No São
Paulo, os cidadãos estão com sede. A Cantareira, que fornece agua para a
cidade, está se secando. Mas o problema não está somente no São Paulo – está
espalhado pelo Brasil inteiro, e a dificuldades estão aumentando rapidamente. A
escassez d’água nos afeta a todos. É urgente que o publico – não somente os
técnicos nem políticos – entendem o que está acontecendo, e como ajudar. How You Can Participate
This campaign will raise money to produce a plantable coloring book to build awareness about the who-what-where-when-and why of the issue, and invite readers to dream up a new future. It will be a book to stimulate the head and the heart, harnessing imagination and knowledge for the the common good. We'd like this message to travel far and wide, so the first 100 people to contribute $25 will receive it. 
Your contribution will go towards supporting amazing art by Rogério, Portuguese translation, editing, binding, and publishing the books on the seed paper with some pretty incredible companies in the US and Brazil, and finally distribution. If the book is one day picked up by a publisher, we plan to donate many of the book sale proceeds to non-profits in Brazil working to re-forest the land, grow food sustainably, and support the construction of water catchment systems. If you'd like to see a more detailed break-down of costs, please scroll down to the bottom.
Thanks for your time and attention! Monetary contributions are awesome, and so is sharing our project on social media!
Como Você Pode Participar
A campanha
vai juntar dinheiro num vaquinha para poder produzir um livro para colorir e
plantar. Esse livro vai ajudar a nos informar sobre o problema, e convidar
leitores a sonhar com um novo futuro. Será um livro para estimular a cabeça e o
coração, fortalecendo a imaginação e conhecimento para o bem comum. A gente
gostaria que viajasse longe esse livro, então os primeiros cem pessoas a
contribuir ao redor de R$100 (exatamente $25USD) vão receber o livro. O livro será imprimido em inglês e
português, dependendo do desejo da pessoa.
Sua contribuição apoiará o trabalho de Rogério, tradução do documento ao Português, edição,
encadernação do livro, impressão no papel semente, e distribuição. Se um dia o
livro é publicado por uma companhia profissional, pensamos em doar muito da
renda do livro a ONGs no Brasil lutando para re-florestar e apoiar as pessoas
sofrendo por falta d’água. Se você gostaria ver mais do orçamento, poder dar
uma olhada aqui embaixo.

<li>
<b>Foreign Travel:</b> I've never been to Peru and I'm excited to immerse myself in a new culture, meet new people, see different places, and leave with new ideas.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Quality Time</b>: staying with a host family and learning the culture from that perspective, along with working alongside others and developing relationships on a daily basis, is a fantastic way to create connection.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Giving Back</b>: to devote two weeks to this program, to work with these kids, to experience that connection, and to help them better their lives—that is going to be amazing!<br/>

<h2>A bit more about the volunteering:</h2>
<p></p>The aim of the <b>Childcare project</b> is for volunteers to provide individual attention and assistance to children from diverse backgrounds. Many children at the placements we work with do not receive the level of affection and education that they deserve, volunteers therefore play an important role in working alongside local staff to improve the educational, emotional and hygiene conditions of the children. Volunteers work in orphanages, community centers, schools and kindergartens. Work varies but generally consists of providing individual attention, playing with children, organizing games and activities, assisting with homework, English classes and educating children about hygiene.<p></p>The <b>Animal Care project</b> offers volunteers the opportunity to work with an organization dedicated to rescuing and caring for street dogs. The aim of this project is to assist in the protection of these animals, providing human company, medical treatment, and playtime. Tasks include bathing and brushing the animals, providing basic obedience training, cleaning cages, helping during feeding time, maintaining the shelter grounds, and walking and playing with the animals . Other activities may include some small construction projects (i.e. building dog runs and creating fences), along with photography, administration, and fundraising for the shelter's operations.<br/>
<br/><p></p>
<h2>Program Cost Breakdown:</h2>
<ul>
<li>IVHQ Administrative Fees: $265</li>
<li>Fees for 2 weeks (room/board/programs): $590</li>
<li>Additional Expenses: transit, food not covered, etc.: $200</li>
<li>Travel Insurance (required by the program): $120</li>
<li>Indiegogo/Credit Card/PayPal fees: $140</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<i><b>Total Costs: $1315</b></i> </div><div>
<p></p>The programs through IVHQ have some of the LOWEST costs around; very often, when you look into volunteering abroad, it can be up to $2000-$3000 <i>per week</i>! </div><div>
<p></p>
<b>This is only $1000 for two weeks!</b>
</div><div>
<p></p>The campaign is set up that WHATEVER is raised, I will receive—and I'm extremely appreciative for that. <b><br/></b>

<p>While this statement may come as a bit of a shock to you, let me explain a bit, and maybe, we'll come full circle...</p>
<h3>People and Plants </h3>
<p>People have lived with plants, for the entirety of their existence.  Its obvious that we have a interwoven relationship.  Day to day, many are surrounded by plants.  They walk under trees, and have lunch by the bushes.  Then they go home, and buy some flowers for their wife.  Generations of people in western society have tended to plants, molding them into shapes.  And today a trip to Disney land, will present a number of cartoon characters sculpted right out of living plants.</p>
<p>The structural function of plants, and trees in particular has an even deeper tradition it seems.  Houses, shelves, equipment, instruments, all are known to be made out of plants, wood from trees in particular.  </p>
<p>For functional uses though, the cutting and processing of trees, requires a huge amount of labor, not to mention the extents we take to put them back together: mining metal, designing tools... glue, tape, measurements, architects...You get the picture.  It's a Lot of work.</p>
<p>The project that I have been working on over the last 4 years, aims at developing and making understandable techniques that avoid all the labor of this last step, by simply not cutting down the tree.  Instead, they are woven into strong and resilient structures that can last hundreds, and even thousands of years.  There is much I could say, and even more that I have to learn.  Yet, I am at a interesting point in my R&amp;D, in which I have the skills and enough knowledge from which I can start presenting my findings. <br/></p><p><br/></p>
<h3>What is getting funded?</h3>
<p>My goal with this campaign is to start setting up 50 living tree houses, around the world, and in a variety of different climates.  This is to 1) provide diverse sites to research, and 2) leave a legacy to future generations of the world.  People can support this goal by picking up one or more of our awesome perks.<br/></p><p> </p>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>What is the impact your campaign may have on others? </strong></p>
<p>My favorite aspect of Living Tree Houses, is that they are accessible to people of every age.  Children can start growing their own home, and by the time they are full grown, they will have their own full size house, perfect for their needs, and created by their own loving handiwork.  It will also empower future generations confidence, and skill in tending to their selves, and living in harmony with nature.<br/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What if your campaign doesn't happen, what are the consequences? </strong></p>
<p>Living tree houses really don't cost anything to make.  They mostly just need land.  I have already started a couple simple test projects, and will continue to do so.  This campaign is really about exposure, and sharing it with people who feel in their heart this is something amazing, and would like to participate (in whatever ways they feel called).<br/></p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong>So, where is the money going?</strong></p>Money donated mostly goes towards travel expenses.  There are a little bit of tools and resources which can be used for setting up the tree houses (e.g. rope), but it's not much compared to the expense of just getting me from point A to point B... safely.<br/>I am setting a goal of about $5,000 - $6,000, to get a healthy start in setting up these 50 living tree houses, but basically... more money= more site visits &amp; more Living TreeHouses... got it?<br/><br/><b>These are my estimates per site visit:</b><br/><br/>$500 per short term visit-<br/>This covers the cost of getting to a relatively accessible location in the US (e.g. close to an airport). People will preferably be able to pick me up at the airport, and drop me back off there, I'll likely be able to pitch a tent or hammock on their land.  These will reduce costs greatly.  Also, I will arranging trips to take advantage of properties that are close to each other.<br/><br/>$1,000 per indepth visit -<br/>This would be for a slightly remote visit, holding a workshop at a site, or possibly spending extra time in research or discussion.  Slightly remote visits, could be someplace not to far out of the US (e.g. relatively affordable to fly/travel to, such as parts of canada, mexico, central america, parts of south america, possibly parts of the South Pacific, and possibly even parts of the UK).  It could also be used isit/remote visitfor spending extra time, to really go into more depth for a living tree house in the US.  This time could be spent setting up multiple living tree houses that are very close to each other or on the same property.  It could also be used towards diving into much deeper discussion and education with the property owners.  And it could also be used towards facilitating a workshop at the site, or nearby.<br/><br/>$1000-$5000 per remote visit outside the US.  This price will vary, depending on the country, and the support offered from people within that country.  This could include parts of Russia, India, Australia, some parts of the UK, Japan, and all the rest of the world (I don't think Antartica is high on the list though, but Alaska definitely can work).<br/><br/>I realize that traveling IS an expense, and I don't expect every person to want, or be able to fly me to their place just to set up a living tree house.  These opportunities, are simply available for those who feel called.  But, I really don't want to leave everyone else out, who would like to stay intouch with the project.  So, to facilitate people in learning and participating from the comfort of their own home, I'll be taking plenty of video footage from these trips.  You will be able to access it at <a href=""http://www.brightlymedia.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.brightlymedia.com</a>, as part of the yearly full access membership for $79.  If you sign up with this indiegogo campaign though, you can pick up a 1-year full access membership for just $49.<br/><em><br/>Money that is not specifically allocated towards a certain site, will go towards reaching the most benefit, with the least effort (pretty much my motto!).<br/><br/></em>

</div></div>","www.BrightlyMedia.comWhat if...What if I was to say, there is a way to create a house, with no hard labor, no expensive technology, and yet could last thousands of years...  It would also have a positive impact on the environment, family culture, and be seamless with nature...  Would you be interested? The StoryOne day several years ago, when sitting in a tree, I was imagining creating a tree house.  Then I realized, ""What if i just bent enough branches and trained them to grow as walls and floors?""  To me, this concept seems familiar to all of us in some ways, yet buried in our subconscous...  Elves, and fairies, all seem to have their homes in living trees and their stories abound even in our modern culture.  Just take the movie ""Avatar"" for example.  In a more practical sense, squirrels, owls, and other small furry animals are often found burrowing in hollowed out portions of trees.  Yet, today our human culture is seemingly devoid of what seems like a potential eco-friendly, and easy to use medium for creating a home- namely, living trees.
While this statement may come as a bit of a shock to you, let me explain a bit, and maybe, we'll come full circle...
People and Plants 
People have lived with plants, for the entirety of their existence.  Its obvious that we have a interwoven relationship.  Day to day, many are surrounded by plants.  They walk under trees, and have lunch by the bushes.  Then they go home, and buy some flowers for their wife.  Generations of people in western society have tended to plants, molding them into shapes.  And today a trip to Disney land, will present a number of cartoon characters sculpted right out of living plants.
The structural function of plants, and trees in particular has an even deeper tradition it seems.  Houses, shelves, equipment, instruments, all are known to be made out of plants, wood from trees in particular.  
For functional uses though, the cutting and processing of trees, requires a huge amount of labor, not to mention the extents we take to put them back together: mining metal, designing tools... glue, tape, measurements, architects...You get the picture.  It's a Lot of work.
The project that I have been working on over the last 4 years, aims at developing and making understandable techniques that avoid all the labor of this last step, by simply not cutting down the tree.  Instead, they are woven into strong and resilient structures that can last hundreds, and even thousands of years.  There is much I could say, and even more that I have to learn.  Yet, I am at a interesting point in my R&D, in which I have the skills and enough knowledge from which I can start presenting my findings. 
What is getting funded?
My goal with this campaign is to start setting up 50 living tree houses, around the world, and in a variety of different climates.  This is to 1) provide diverse sites to research, and 2) leave a legacy to future generations of the world.  People can support this goal by picking up one or more of our awesome perks. 

The Impact
What is the impact your campaign may have on others? 
My favorite aspect of Living Tree Houses, is that they are accessible to people of every age.  Children can start growing their own home, and by the time they are full grown, they will have their own full size house, perfect for their needs, and created by their own loving handiwork.  It will also empower future generations confidence, and skill in tending to their selves, and living in harmony with nature.
 
What if your campaign doesn't happen, what are the consequences? 
Living tree houses really don't cost anything to make.  They mostly just need land.  I have already started a couple simple test projects, and will continue to do so.  This campaign is really about exposure, and sharing it with people who feel in their heart this is something amazing, and would like to participate (in whatever ways they feel called).
 


What We Need & What You Get:

So, where is the money going?Money donated mostly goes towards travel expenses.  There are a little bit of tools and resources which can be used for setting up the tree houses (e.g. rope), but it's not much compared to the expense of just getting me from point A to point B... safely.I am setting a goal of about $5,000 - $6,000, to get a healthy start in setting up these 50 living tree houses, but basically... more money= more site visits & more Living TreeHouses... got it?These are my estimates per site visit:$500 per short term visit-This covers the cost of getting to a relatively accessible location in the US (e.g. close to an airport). People will preferably be able to pick me up at the airport, and drop me back off there, I'll likely be able to pitch a tent or hammock on their land.  These will reduce costs greatly.  Also, I will arranging trips to take advantage of properties that are close to each other.$1,000 per indepth visit -This would be for a slightly remote visit, holding a workshop at a site, or possibly spending extra time in research or discussion.  Slightly remote visits, could be someplace not to far out of the US (e.g. relatively affordable to fly/travel to, such as parts of canada, mexico, central america, parts of south america, possibly parts of the South Pacific, and possibly even parts of the UK).  It could also be used isit/remote visitfor spending extra time, to really go into more depth for a living tree house in the US.  This time could be spent setting up multiple living tree houses that are very close to each other or on the same property.  It could also be used towards diving into much deeper discussion and education with the property owners.  And it could also be used towards facilitating a workshop at the site, or nearby.$1000-$5000 per remote visit outside the US.  This price will vary, depending on the country, and the support offered from people within that country.  This could include parts of Russia, India, Australia, some parts of the UK, Japan, and all the rest of the world (I don't think Antartica is high on the list though, but Alaska definitely can work).I realize that traveling IS an expense, and I don't expect every person to want, or be able to fly me to their place just to set up a living tree house.  These opportunities, are simply available for those who feel called.  But, I really don't want to leave everyone else out, who would like to stay intouch with the project.  So, to facilitate people in learning and participating from the comfort of their own home, I'll be taking plenty of video footage from these trips.  You will be able to access it at www.brightlymedia.com, as part of the yearly full access membership for $79.  If you sign up with this indiegogo campaign though, you can pick up a 1-year full access membership for just $49.Money that is not specifically allocated towards a certain site, will go towards reaching the most benefit, with the least effort (pretty much my motto!).

What is going on in our Borough is a travesty that we feel helpless to prevent. It is affecting the safety and wellbeing of thousands of Borough residents.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The Brooks Farm in Closter, the oldest continuously operating family farm in New Jersey, dates back to the 18th Century. It is also listed as a National Landmark recognized for its significance in American History and is also protected by the NJ State as a Historical site. In 2004 the State paid over $2.5 million to the then-owner of the farm for the conservation, preservation and development rights so that future generations would continue to enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>Stop the Greed</strong></p>
<p>This changed abruptly when the farm was sold to a large chain of plant manufacturers in early 2012. Masquerading as a farm, this industrial enterprise is rapidly erasing this pristine chapter of the State’s history all while hiding behind the protection of the Right to Farm Act. In a short span of a few weeks they cut close to a hundred centuries old trees, began massive construction of industrial retaining walls to contain a huge amount of brought in soil affecting protected C1 streams, pounded the soil using heavy industrial equipment making it virtually impervious, re-graded the property, etc. No plans were presented to municipal authorities nor were any permits requested as the Act’s protections preempt local jurisdiction. The enterprise in development is being planned to support the supply chain of the wholesale and retail operations of the plant factory and will create heavy commercial traffic in the quaint historic district of town with all safety, environmental, flooding, and water contamination and pollution concerns stemming from it.</p>
<p>There has been a loud outcry from our residents to enforce our ordinances in order to protect their health, safety and welfare and yet we are superseded by the Farm Act. The Borough and a group of concerned residents filed a complaint with the County Board of Agriculture. In addition, the residents filed a lawsuit for restraining further development of the property until complaints are adjudicated.</p>
<p>A portion of the tax dollars of the residents of the Bergen County and the State of New Jersey were spent supposedly to preserve this land but instead have been used to subsidize the corporation's purchase of the property (tax dollars paid about 2/3 of the price of the land, corporation paid 1/3).</p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>We need your help and contributions so we can continue with our efforts to save this 302 year old farm from the hands of corporate greed. Unfortunately, the time and tireless effort of many concerned residents of Closter are not simply enough in this matter. Fighting corporations does not come at a low cost, and we are in desperate needs of funds to pay the group's attorney. It is a battle that needs to be fought in the courts, and as most know, legal fees are no bargain.</p>
<p>Any donations you can give would be greatly appreciated.</p></div>","The residents of Closter, a small town in northern New Jersey, need your help.

Masquerading as a farm, this industrial enterprise is rapidly erasing this pristine chapter of the State’s history all while hiding behind the protection of the Right to Farm Act. In a short span of a few weeks they cut close to a hundred centuries old trees, began massive construction of industrial retaining walls to contain a huge amount of brought in soil affecting protected C1 streams, pounded the soil using heavy industrial equipment making it virtually impervious, re-graded the property, etc. No plans were presented to municipal authorities nor were any permits requested as the Act’s protections preempt local jurisdiction. The enterprise in development is being planned to support the supply chain of the wholesale and retail operations of the plant factory and will create heavy commercial traffic in the quaint historic district of town with all safety, environmental, flooding, and water contamination and pollution concerns stemming from it.
There has been a loud outcry from our residents to enforce our ordinances in order to protect their health, safety and welfare and yet we are superseded by the Farm Act. The Borough and a group of concerned residents filed a complaint with the County Board of Agriculture. In addition, the residents filed a lawsuit for restraining further development of the property until complaints are adjudicated.
A portion of the tax dollars of the residents of the Bergen County and the State of New Jersey were spent supposedly to preserve this land but instead have been used to subsidize the corporation's purchase of the property (tax dollars paid about 2/3 of the price of the land, corporation paid 1/3).
What We Need
We need your help and contributions so we can continue with our efforts to save this 302 year old farm from the hands of corporate greed. Unfortunately, the time and tireless effort of many concerned residents of Closter are not simply enough in this matter. Fighting corporations does not come at a low cost, and we are in desperate needs of funds to pay the group's attorney. It is a battle that needs to be fought in the courts, and as most know, legal fees are no bargain.
Any donations you can give would be greatly appreciated.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Who I am and how you can help me save lions</h3>
<p>My name is Tutilo Mudumba and I am a lion researcher who has been working to save one of Uganda's last lion populations in Murchion Falls National Park since 2005. Wildlife snaring is one of the biggest threats to lions in Murchison and we've lost more than half of our populaton in the last ten years. My team and I presently cover an area of ~1500 km2 in which we track 90 lions, follow their movements and assist anti-poaching teams with removing lions and other wildlife caugt in snares.</p>
<p>The Northern Bank of the Albert Nile river is one of the hot spots for snaring in the park and we are in dire need of a small outboard motor to patrol this section of the park. We've lost four lions in this region alone this year and patrolling this river section will greatly help us reduce the number of snaring events on lions and their prey. </p>
</div>
<h3>What we need &amp; How you can help</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need £ 1200 to purchase a small second-hand Yamaha/Honda outboard motor (20 hp or greater)</li>
<li>This motor will be attached to an existing patrol boat currently deployed along the Northern bank of the Albert Nile river</li>
<li>Your donations will be rewarded with anything from a limited edition series of lion photographs taken in the field in Murchison to a ""I saved a lion today"" shirt. The highest donor will also receive a framed photograph of the first 50 snares removed by my team along the Northern bank!</li>
</ul><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With an outboard motor our team and I will be better equipped to cover this section of the park, remove snare lines laid by poachers and remove lions and their prey from snares</p>
<p>Lions in Africa are facing a crisis with maybe ~30 000 individuals left and this population of lions is critical to the persistence of lions in the state of Uganda </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We are in a state of financial crisis and many of us are not able to help by donating, but some of our friends may be in a position to give. We would be grateful if you could spread the word along twitter, facebook and other social media sites!</p>

<h3>The GOAL<br/>
</h3>
<p>Hello, I'm Jeremy Williams with <a href=""http://rivervoices.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://rivervoices.ca</a><br/>I've been producing environmental and social justice documentaries for 14 years and have won a few awards in the process.I am passionate about human relationships with the land and how we can re-learn to live in balance with the earth and each other. <br/></p>
<p>My goal is to create a compelling documentary film about the Tsilhqot'in (aka Chilcotin) region of ""BC"" (Canada), which is a major tributary of the mighty Fraser River and is connected to the coast and its salmon. This area is extremely wild, magical and in need of our protection! With your support, we will tell this story to the world, and help protect this amazing wilderness!<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What we need financial support for;<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>In order to create a professional film that can reach a global audience, I need to give it the effort it deserves. This means travel, vehicle and equipment maintenance ; production costs, licensing music... (See our budget below)<br/>
</li>
<li>Filming; our travel expenses are minimized by camping and carpooling, but each trip to the Tsilhqot'in costs $1,000. <br/>
</li>
<li>PERKS! Ranging from credit in the film, DVDs, and T-shirts to a Trip to Chilko Lake Lodge, we are offering a huge spectrum of benefits to you, the funder!<br/>
</li>
<li>This project is ongoing and every bit of support will be put to use as we prioritize our needs and creative goals.</li>
<li>Aside from financial support, we need you on our team to tell this story, raise awareness and spread the word!<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is part of a larger campaign to protect this magical wilderness and your contribution will not only help this film, but the <b>conservation of wildlife and their habitat!</b><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>This project is about social justice and the environment and will impact and inspire people around the world!<br/>
</li>
<li>This project is my passion and I know that it will be effective and reach a global audience.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you can't contribute financially, please help by spreading the word!<br/>
</li>
<li>Please use the Indiegogo share tools, and social networks!<br/>
</li>
</ul>

<span><b>ABSTRACT </b> <br/></span></p>
<p><span>This film will explore the radically different cultural 
paradigms of indigenous values and colonial or 'gold rush' mentality 
which continues to prevail in Canadian politics.  We take a deep look at
 the landscape with its' vast wilderness and wildlife values, the 
Tsilhqot’in culture, spiritual relationship with the land and their 
fight for justice. Ranchers and non-native residents will offer a 
variety of perspectives and add modern context to life in the 
wilderness.</span>Rich with poetic cinematography, the films will inspire the audience to action.<br/></p>

<p><span></span></p>
<p>
<b><span>THE STORY</span></b><br/><span><br/></span></p>
<p><span>The Feature Film will weave
 together Tsilhqot'in myths, place based traditional ecological 
knowledge (TEK), historic battles (the Chilcotin war of 1864), and 
contextualize the current fight for rights and title as well as the 
fight to stop the proposed ""Prosperity"" gold mine. The Tsilhqot'in, with
 the support of many environmental organizations have been fighting to 
stop this mine and its' potential to destroy this last great wilderness 
of BC.</span><span>​</span></p>
<p>
<b><span><br/></span></b></p>
<p><b><span>THE CHARACTERS</span></b><br/><span><br/></span></p>
<p><span>The films will portray the 
rich culture of the Tsilhqot'in people, as well as the 'new comers' and 
ranchers that call this place home. The majestic landscape and wildlife 
are characters in this story too; the salmon that swim 600km up the 
Fraser and Chilko rivers, the grizzly bears, and wild horses.</span></p>
<p>
<span><b><br/></b></span></p>
<p><span><b>THE PLAN</b><br/></span></p>
<p><span>Over the course of one year (+/-) the crew will capture key cultural 
and political events in and around the Tsilhqot'in lands, court battles 
and protests, chronicling the struggle for rights and title both 
historic and current. </span><br/></p>
<p>
<span>The Feature Film will be broadcast on TV, reach the international community through filmfestivals and be distributed on DVD.</span></p>
<p>
<b><span>CULTURE</span></b></p>
<p>
<span>To best represent the culture, interviews will be in Tsilhqot’in language whenever possible. </span></p>
<p>
<b><span>ENVIRONMENTAL FOCUS</span>​</b></p>
<p>
<span>The Tsilhqot'in region is 
perhaps the biggest and biologically richest area in southern British 
Columbia, yet this wild land is under threat of destruction. Clearcut 
logging has destroyed much of the rainshadow forests of the norther 
Tsilhqot'in territory and the proposed ""Prosperity"" gold mine at Teztan 
Biny (Fish Lake) could leach toxins into the entire watershed for 
millennia. </span></p>
<p>
<span>The rugged landscapes from 
the Coast Mountain Range east to the Fraser River are home to a healthy 
population of grizzly bears that have been extirpated from their former 
ranges south to Mexico. </span></p>
<p>
<span>Wolves, </span><span>moose, black bear, caribou, mountain goat, Mule deer, cougar, coyote and other species thrive here.</span><span>The project will highlight the amazing opportunities for conservation of ecosystems and threatened wildlife. </span></p>
<p>
<b><span>THE CAMPAIGN </span></b></p>
<p>
<span>Since 1990, the Tsilhqot'in
 have been fighting for justice in the courts. Several environmental 
organizations have been working alongside them to protect this paradise 
for generations to come. </span>​</p>

Hello, I'm Jeremy Williams with http://rivervoices.caI've been producing environmental and social justice documentaries for 14 years and have won a few awards in the process.I am passionate about human relationships with the land and how we can re-learn to live in balance with the earth and each other. 
My goal is to create a compelling documentary film about the Tsilhqot'in (aka Chilcotin) region of ""BC"" (Canada), which is a major tributary of the mighty Fraser River and is connected to the coast and its salmon. This area is extremely wild, magical and in need of our protection! With your support, we will tell this story to the world, and help protect this amazing wilderness!


What We Need & What You Get
What we need financial support for;

In order to create a professional film that can reach a global audience, I need to give it the effort it deserves. This means travel, vehicle and equipment maintenance ; production costs, licensing music... (See our budget below)

Filming; our travel expenses are minimized by camping and carpooling, but each trip to the Tsilhqot'in costs $1,000. 

PERKS! Ranging from credit in the film, DVDs, and T-shirts to a Trip to Chilko Lake Lodge, we are offering a huge spectrum of benefits to you, the funder!

This project is ongoing and every bit of support will be put to use as we prioritize our needs and creative goals.
Aside from financial support, we need you on our team to tell this story, raise awareness and spread the word!




The Impact
This project is part of a larger campaign to protect this magical wilderness and your contribution will not only help this film, but the conservation of wildlife and their habitat!

This project is about social justice and the environment and will impact and inspire people around the world!

This project is my passion and I know that it will be effective and reach a global audience.



Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:

If you can't contribute financially, please help by spreading the word!

Please use the Indiegogo share tools, and social networks!



Thank you!

Tree Counts! 
Above is the tree we were able to save! Its trunk, roots and canopy grow across our property line with a neighbor who tried to have it cut down. With the help of celebrated lawyer Clayton Ruby, we won a legal landmark ruling preventing one owner of a shared tree from unilaterally cutting it down. Our ruling protects the many thousands of trees in Canada that grow across property lines. We
are asking you to help us raise funds to pay the legal costs we have accrued to achieve this landmark legal ruling.
Our story:  Over the past 18 months, the Scharpers have spent tens of thousands of dollars in their own money to
preserve and protect not only their own shared tree, but also thousands of other shared trees. Under law, these co-owned trees are common property. They make our backyards, neighborhoods and cities beautiful places to live. Our fight to save the maple began over a year ago when our neighbor suddenly announced her
intention to cut it down. We hired expert arborists who determined that the
maple is healthy, vigorous and has 50+ more years of life ahead. We tried to
convince our neighbor to preserve the tree (offering to fully pay for the maple’s
maintenence ourselves), but she hired a lawyer who began to threaten us with legal action. We
politely but firmly objected to the destruction of a healthy tree. Our neighbor
then sued us. 
As our case went to the
Ontario Superior Court, we discovered that our situation was not unusual. According to expert arborists, each year thousands of shared trees are arbitrarily cut
down by one owner. After many stressful months of mounting legal bills, we successfully defended ourselves against the lawsuit and won a landmark
legal ruling. The Ontario Superior Court dismissed our neighbor's lawsuit in May 2013. In December 2013 our neighbor appealed, but her case was again dismissed.The 4-page ruling can be read at http://boundarytrees.com 
The modest $15,000 campaign goal on this website
represents a fraction of our legal costs. (Costs to defend the ruling against
the appeal alone will be approximately $35,000.)

Expeditions”—an outdoor adventure program that serves groups, non-profits,
schools, and organizations. We aren’t a “conveyor belt” type of rafting

amidst Oregon’s most beautiful landscapes. </p>
<p>Last year we found our first

<p>We invested over $28,000 of
our own money to get this off the ground. We got 60 kids outdoors our first
season, and served four different organizations.  We learned a ton. Most importantly, we confirmed there is a lot of interest and enthusiasm for what we’re doing. We
already have additional partners lined up for next season and anticipate running
three times as many trips. </p>
<p>We need help to survive this
initial period of growth. And we decided to put it out to the
internet-crowd-funding universe!</p>
<p>For us to get more people
outdoors adventuring, we need to raise $8,600:</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>$5,000 to cover our insurance premiums</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>$2,400 to get us a much needed new raft</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>$1,200 for new tires on our van (and trust us, we

I heard about the train from several Buddhist teachers who encouraged me to try to be on it. I hope to have many conversations on the train and at the march with concerned citizens of many backgrounds to put my finger on the pulse of the climate movement. I hope what I learn will be interesting, inspiring or helpful to others, so I'll share pictures, stories and reflections from the trip in my community. <br/><b>I'll give a presentation</b> at the San Francisco Zen Center to share my experience of the trip, and how it all fits into my thinking on Engaged Buddhism and the Climate Crisis. This trip is both personally exciting and enriching as well as an opportunity to share my journey with others, heightening awareness and positive energy around this incredibly important issue.

<p>I initially disregarded the idea of this train because I don't have extra money. However, a trustworthy friend encouraged me to ask others for help.

I will pay back whatever I cannot raise, but $450 is what I need to raise to make this trip affordable.

</div></div>","Let’s ring in the new year with a brand new perk! With a shout out to our partners in Kenya, Big Life Foundation, we proudly offer the stunning photography of co-founder Nick Brandt.Nick’s photographs are a tribute to the 35,000 elephants slaughtered annually for their ivory, valued at over $2,000 a pound, and to the other big animals that define Africa.  Big Life is the only organization in East Africa with coordinated cross-border (Kenya/Tanzania) anti-poaching operations. Big Life employs 280 rangers, with 30 outposts and 15 vehicles protecting 2 million acres of wilderness in the Amboseli-Tsavo ecosystem of E. Africa. In their desire to give back to the Maasai Mara villagers – and to protect critical habitat from the pressure of firewood scavenging – Big Life is partnering with Solavore to introduce fuel-free, 100% renewable solar cooking to the villages in this region.Your contribution of $75 will help fund this program, and in return you’ll get a signed copy of Nick’s book “Across the Ravaged Land.”  Thank you!Hey everybody! Just as the ink is drying on the COP21 Accord signatures in Paris – woohoo! - we’re introducing one of our biggest supporters and champions of change in Cambodia, Mr. Yorn Yon, President of the United Cambodian American Association. Improving the lives of his countrymen back home is Yorn’s passion, and he is equally passionate about the power of solar cooking for smallholder farmers, reducing deforestation and literally saving life and limb. We’ve created a special perk to make it easy to join Yorn in helping his countrymen: a 100% silk Cambodian scarf from Cambodia as a bonus when you contribute $145 for a Solavore Sport solar oven. We’re gearing up for training beginning in January in 5 regions all around Cambodia – and we need your help to ensure that every class is full.  Thank you for becoming a Solavore!

100%
fuel-free cooking.  No burning of any gas
or biomass. No smoke inhaled.
2-pot
cooking capacity capable of cooking for a family of 8, two meals a day.
Simmering,
baking, dehydrating, even water pasteurization. 
Built to last - ten years or longer.






Today,
almost 3 billion people still cook over wood fire.  Women are bound to generational roles of
wood-gathering, fire-tending, and the constant stirring of cooking pots.
With
your help, women will breathe clean indoor air, they’ll have time for learning
or starting a micro-business, and forests will recover. 






Today,
respiratory illness kills over 4 million women and children per year, more than
malaria, more than AIDS.
Women
walk increasingly greater distances, often into harm’s way, in their search for
fuel wood.
Loss
of trees leads to changes in rainfall and wind patterns, such as in Cambodia,
where the primary forest covered 70% of the country in 1969.  Now it’s
around 3.1%. 

Solavore: empowering
women, one solar-cooked meal at a time.









We stretch every dollar by
partnering with local organizations – teams who know the people, their customs
and their cuisine.  And we create jobs –
assembling ovens, distributing ovens and training new users.
Hand in Hand India’s self help
groups and microfinance programs have empowered over a million women in ten
countries throughout Asia and Africa.  
The BigLife Foundation is dedicated
to the preservation of African wild lands and wildlife, and they’re committed
to improving the lives in the Maasai Mara villages where they base their
outposts. 


The Cambodian
diaspora in the US (UCAM) is our newest partner, joining the UN Foundation
agency IFAD (Int’l Fund for Agricultural Development) and the Royal Government
of Cambodia who invited Solavore to join their Renewable Energy Technology
pilot earlier this year.

dehydrate
2.

Solavore:

Our

With your help, Solavore and Hand in Hand will launch a
revolving fund for 100 ovens.

In Kenya, we’re expanding our initial pilot to three
villages, including hiring a local trainer…very exciting!



In Cambodia, we’ll be training new Solavores from five
districts, ranging from farmers near Phnom Penh to the boat people of Tonlé Sap
Lake.




These are ambitious efforts, and with your help we’ll be
building the foundation for on-going, self-sustaining programs.

</p><p><b>About Me:</b></p><p>
</p><p>My
name is Dewi, I was born into a peasant family. After a serious accident, my
father had to give up his career as an architect and my mother became the
breadwinner. My mother is a farmer. We have rice fields located close to Ubud,
on the island of Bali. Our everyday needs are met through the crops we grow in
the fields. This is where I learnt how to use plants as medicine and for
everyday uses, such as hair conditioners, body scrubs, etc. I attended school
while working part-time in the rice fields. Eventually I managed to obtain a
scholarship to further my education in biology /plant sciences at the
University of Udayana, Bali.</p><p>
</p><p>I love to share the knowledge that I gained over
the years so that the younger generation could learn to care more about the
environment and can utilize natural resources for daily life, such as the use
of plants for their healing purposes. I hope that my business can spur young
people to return to nature, the concept of a harmonious relationship between:
man and God, man and man, and man and his environment. Moreover, I hope to be
able to realize this business so that I can provide care and accommodation for
my elderly parents.</p><p>
</p><p><b>The Idea:</b></p><p>
</p><p>Purpose for establishing this business is:</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<span>I</span><span>ntroduce</span> <span>the
     farming culture to the younger generation so that they learn to care about the importance and
     preservation of agriculture in
     our lives.This is
     done by doing a walking tour in
     the agricultural area, with
     an explanation about
     the rice growing process from cultivation, maintenance, through to harvesting.
     Preserving the irrigation system and the
     concept of harmony to maintain
     a relationship between God, farmers and
     their environment - the rice field.  This way the younger generation can more respect the environment, by doing the tour. <br/></span><span>Moreover,
     the tour will</span> <span>include an explanation about the various types
     of plants that can be used for daily living. The participants will be taught
     plant classification and descriptions
     of plants that can be used
     for daily food, for traditional medicine
     and beauty products.
</span>
</li>
<li><span>Botanical Class: This class will explain the process of making a natural product that is made with the concept of back to nature.  We will have a hands-on experience in creating our own botanical products, which they can take home.<br/></span></li>
<li><span>Fresh Botanical Supplier: I will do good relation with farmers and support them to growing organic plants.  When these are harvested I will collect some vegetables, fruits, rice, all that is harvested from ricefield and I will buy it from the farmers.  I use it for Botanical class ingredients and sell it to people. This business will help farmers to get more income for their children going to school.     </span></li>

<p>Our current solar system is comprised of five solar panels that create 100 watts of energy.  For now we can run everything with that.  However with winter coming and the shortening of days we can't get enough from what we have.</p>
<p>With better panels combined with thicker wiring through out we will be able to maximize our power charge to the battery bank.</p>

</div></div>","Hello and Welcome to ANIÁN OFF THE GRID  ANIÁN OFF THE GRID is about our journey. It has taken us from shaping surfboards in our back yards to manufacturing goods in Canada and selling them in our own store.  With your support we can take the next step. Together we can make ANIÁN Canada's 1st and only 100% OFF THE GRID retail store, located in Victoria and powered entirely by solar energy.
How can we do it?
We have already done it. We just need to make it bigger.

Current System

Our current solar system is comprised of five solar panels that create 100 watts of energy.  For now we can run everything with that.  However with winter coming and the shortening of days we can't get enough from what we have.
With better panels combined with thicker wiring through out we will be able to maximize our power charge to the battery bank.

Perks
Free shipping for stickers and post cards, for everything else please add 10 bucks.

<h3><b>The problem</b></h3>
<p>Two years ago I worked as an industrial engineer at a
big company that produces beers, water and soft drinks. They use plastic bottles
to sell their products, and the problem is that they don`t recycle this bottles.  In my country (Colombia), we produce around
40.000 tons per day of solid waste, but we just recycled the 5%.</p>
<p>I decided to quit my job and dedicate myself to find a
profitable solution to solving this problem. </p>
<p> <span style=""color: #2D8F20;""><i>(Español)</i></span><b> </b> Hace dos años, estaba trabajando como ingeniero industrial
en una gran compañía que produce cerveza, agua y bebidas. Ellos usan botellas plásticas
para vender sus productos, sin embargo estas botellas no se reciclan. En
Colombia producimos más de 40.000 toneladas al día de residuos sólidos pero
solo reciclamos el 5%. </p>
<h3><b>The Solution </b></h3>
<p>We produce furniture from plastic and agro industrial
wastes from the coffee industry, based on an innovative process. Plastic wastes
come mainly from used plastic bottles that would otherwise be discarded as
contaminating garbage. Agro industrial wastes include coffee chaff, rice chaff
and sugar cane. This mix gives our products resistance to moisture, rot and
insects. It also provides UV resistance, rigidity and the feel and look of
solid wood. </p>
<p> <span style=""color: #2D8F20;""><i>(Español)</i></span><b> </b>nosotros producimos mobiliario hecho a partir de plástico
reciclado y desechos agro-industriales de la industria del café. Los desechos
plásticos provienen de las botellas plásticas las cuales no están siendo
reutilizadas y son altamente contaminantes. Los desechos agro industriales que
mas utilizamos son la cascarilla de café y bagazo de caña. Con esta innovadora
mezcla obtenemos un producto resistente a la humedad, insectos y no se pudre.
Al igual que es resistente a los rayos UV, al agua, nieve y tiene apariencia a
la madera. </p>

</div></div>","Where others see rubbish, garbage and waste, we at Diseclar see
furniture. Thanks to our inventive manufacturing process we’re able to turn
waste materials into stylish furniture that can be used in and outdoors. By
using non-degradable plastic and vegetable fibers that come from
agro-industrial waste sites, we’re able to create a product that both looks and
feels like solid wood. Our stylish, custom pieces not only look great, they’re also
resistant to moisture, rot, insects and UV rays, and are markedly better for
the environment than traditionally produced furniture.
 (Español)  Donde muchas personas ven basura, desperdicios y desechos, nosotros en
Diseclar vemos Mobiliario. Gracias a nuestro proceso de producción innovador y
amigable con el medio ambiente, transformamos la basura en mobiliario con
diseños exclusivos y elegantes, los cuales pueden ser usados en exteriores. Se
fabrican a partir de plástico reciclado y fibra natural que proviene de
desechos agro-industriales, con lo cual logramos crear productos con apariencia
y textura a la madera. Nuestros productos brindan ciertas ventajas en comparación
a los mobiliarios tradicionales, ya que son resistentes a la humedad, no se
pudren, insectos, a los rayos ultravioleta (Sol), y protegemos al medio
ambiente
The problem
Two years ago I worked as an industrial engineer at a
big company that produces beers, water and soft drinks. They use plastic bottles
to sell their products, and the problem is that they don`t recycle this bottles.  In my country (Colombia), we produce around
40.000 tons per day of solid waste, but we just recycled the 5%.
I decided to quit my job and dedicate myself to find a
profitable solution to solving this problem. 
 (Español)  Hace dos años, estaba trabajando como ingeniero industrial
en una gran compañía que produce cerveza, agua y bebidas. Ellos usan botellas plásticas
para vender sus productos, sin embargo estas botellas no se reciclan. En
Colombia producimos más de 40.000 toneladas al día de residuos sólidos pero
solo reciclamos el 5%. 
The Solution 
We produce furniture from plastic and agro industrial
wastes from the coffee industry, based on an innovative process. Plastic wastes
come mainly from used plastic bottles that would otherwise be discarded as
contaminating garbage. Agro industrial wastes include coffee chaff, rice chaff
and sugar cane. This mix gives our products resistance to moisture, rot and
insects. It also provides UV resistance, rigidity and the feel and look of
solid wood. 
 (Español) nosotros producimos mobiliario hecho a partir de plástico
reciclado y desechos agro-industriales de la industria del café. Los desechos
plásticos provienen de las botellas plásticas las cuales no están siendo
reutilizadas y son altamente contaminantes. Los desechos agro industriales que
mas utilizamos son la cascarilla de café y bagazo de caña. Con esta innovadora
mezcla obtenemos un producto resistente a la humedad, insectos y no se pudre.
Al igual que es resistente a los rayos UV, al agua, nieve y tiene apariencia a
la madera. 
Our current product portfolio includes (nuestro
portafolio):

Home chairs and tables (Mesas y sillas): Garden Lounge
Set 




Beach chairs (Sillas para playa): Baru Chair






Benches (Bancas): Española Bench 




Farallones Bench




Pool Chairs (asoleadora):




Decks (pisos):


Dog 
Houses (casas para mascots):



What is the big problem we face in the world today?
Environmental and Social Impact in Our region: 
In the World, we generate more than 9.975.000.000 tons
of solid waste per day, this is equivalent to the weight of 25 million Boeings
747!.
(Español) en la tierra producimos más de 9.975.000.000 de toneladas
al día de residuos sólidos, lo que equivale al peso de ¡25 millones de Boeings
747!


In Latin-America alone, we generate around 463.000
tons of solid waste per day and recycle only 5% of this, each person generates
more than 1,4 kg/day.
 (Español) En Latinoamérica se producen más de 463.000 toneladas al
día de residuos sólidos, sin embargo solo reciclamos el 5%, es decir que cada
persona genera alrededor de 1,4 kg/day.




55% of this solid waste is going to sea, where many
animals die every day from eating waste like plastic caps, plastic bottles,
plastics glasses and other plastic objects. 
 (Español) 55% de los residuos sólidos van al mar, donde gran parte
de los animales mueren cada día al ingerir estos desperdicios como tapas
plásticas, botellas, vasos plásticos, entre otros. 



Deforestation in Latin-America stands at 50.000 km2 per year
(the area of Switzerland!), cut every year to produce, among others, wood
furniture. These forests are the home to millions of animal species and the
spring point for thousands of rivers that bring water to 588 million Latin
Americans. 
 (Español) la deforestación en Latinoamérica es de 50.000 km2 por año, lo
cual se asemeja al área de Suiza. Estos árboles son cortados para producir
mobiliario. Los bosques que son cortados día tras día, nacen las fuentes
hídricas que alimentan a las de 588 millones de latinoamericanos y es el hogar
de millones de animales. 





There are more than 135.000 recyclers in Latin- American, people who
live of recycling wastes every day in the street and that do not receive a fair
compensation. Many of them earn less than USD1 per day.  
 (Español) existen más de 135.000 recicladores en Latinoamérica, los cuales viven de
la basura que recogen día tras día en las calles y no reciben una buena
remuneración para esta labor. Muchos de ellos viven con menos de USD 1 por día. 

There are more than 563.000 coffee farmers in Latin America. Ever year
their incomes are affected by fluctuating exchange rates that often led to net
losses. 
 (Español) en nuestro continente hay más de 563.000 caficultores los cuales se ven
afectados por la fluctuación del dólar, cuando venden sus productos, generando
bajos ingresos para sus familias. 

Re-using wastes to produce a substitute for wood tackles 3 key
environmental and social issues of our region of influence in Colombia:
1) 
CO2 emissions: In our first year of operations we
will recycle 300.000 kg of plastic waste and 192.000 kg of agro-industrial
waste thus preventing the production of 35.136 ton of CO2.  
2) 
Deforestation: As a substitute for wood for
furniture production, our mix saves the lives of more than 2.000 trees per
year.
3) 
Unemployment among the most vulnerable: 
a. 
We will create 300 indirect jobs
among recyclers from whom we will source plastic wastes. Recyclers are the
poorest and most vulnerable social group in the region.
b. 
We will create 250 indirect jobs
among Coffee farmers whom we will source coffee wastes from (Vegetable Fiber)
 (Español) en Diseclar reciclamos los desechos para producir un producto que reemplaza
a la madera, con lo cual generamos 3 impactos positivos ambientales y sociales
en nuestra región. 
1) 
Emisión de CO2: en el primer año de
operaciones esperamos reciclar mas 300.000 kg de desechos plásticos y más de
192.000 kg de desechos agro-industriales, con lo cual lograremos retenes más de
35.136 toneladas de CO2
2) 
Deforestación: reemplazando del uso de la madera en la fabricación de
mobiliario lograremos salvar más de 2.000 árboles. 
3) 
Empleo a personas vulnerables:
a.  Crearemos más de 300 empleos indirectos a recicladores quienes son nuestro
principal proveedor de materia prima. Los recicladores son personas de bajos
recursos y vulnerables en nuestra región.
b.   Crearemos más de 250 empleos
indirectos a caficultores, quienes son nuestro proveedor de la fibra
vegetal.

</h3><p><i>Down for ""ENGLISH VERSION""</i></p><p> L'idée 
est de construire avec un budget et un temps réduit, un catamaran doté 
d'une motorisation électrique performante et pouvant compenser en continu une 
partie ou totalité de l'énergie consommée pour avancer. De cette façon, ce bateau à moteur sera aussi vertueux qu'un voilier sans devoir avoir de compétences particulières pour le manœuvrer. Il reprends à la fois les avantages d'un voilier (écologie et silence) et d'un bateau à moteur ( ligne droite et rapidité).</p>
<p>La 
solution globale utilisera toutes les sources d'énergies disponibles sur l'eau 
avec l'objectif d'en faire un démonstrateur écologique, éducatif et ludique 
. Pourquoi pas faire venir des écoliers pour leur donner l'envie de travailler dans ce domaine d'activité !... Ou d'en faire un projet pilote avec la commune qui accueillera le bateau (Place déjà en location personnelle)</p>
<p>Ce 
projet se veut collaboratif et constructif, il pourra susciter des envies de 
projets identiques sur la base développée, </p>
<p>Je 
suis parti du constat que dans la grande majorité des ""day boats"" les 
utilisateurs font des sorties pour rejoindre leur point de baignade ou de pèche favori d'une demie journée. Cela se résume souvent à 1/2 voir 1 
heure de navigation ""allez"" et idem ""retour"" . Entre deux, le bateau peut ainsi rester plusieurs heures sans 
bouger. Une fois le bateau rentré au port il est peut fréquent qu'il faille le 
réutiliser le jour même ou le lendemain .</p>
<p>La 
solution technique que j'ai choisie tient compte de ces paramètres.</p><p></p><p><i>The idea is
to build with a low budget and a short time, a light catamaran with a powerful

<p><i>The overall

<h3><b>Social Entrepreneurism</b></h3>
<p>Given the
conditions under which these trees grow, it’s hard to find a more “organic”
product than the Brazil nut. With a yet to be popularized forest product at our
finger tips, a food that originates from nature’s heights and vast wilds,
infused with the potency of the rainy season, we have the essential ingredient
to make this a successful business while meeting our first-line mission.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>While
there is no single or conclusive definition of social entrepreneurism, our
intention in using it to capture our business model is to highlight Santa
Tierra Castañal’s central mission of meeting important environmental and social
goals. Protecting primary forest in Peru’s Mother of God region and increasing
the value of our team’s expertise while preserving the art of Brazil nut
harvesting are the first measures of our bottom line success. Yet, to be
sustainable without on-going cyclical fundraisers beyond this crowd funding
launch, (which would nudge it into the non-profit sector), we must make the
venture healthy and profitable into the future. </p>

<p>As a North American I’ve carried purpose and a passion to act as a change agent by ushering in an impactful project.
</p>
<p>My
relationship to Peru’s SE jungle started in 2008 with more than a decade of
travels throughout the country already under my belt. The art, poetry and
heritage of the Brazil nut trees touched me from the start. </p>
<p>Returning
to Colorado from Peru in September of 2015, one of more than 40 trips spanning
20 years, I flew by way of El Salvador where decades ago, my relationship with
Latin America began. My head nodded to my life-long commitment to Latin
American studies and Spanish language fluency while my heart paused with the
memories of people I knew and loved during my formative years in both El Salvador
and  Guatemala. I’ve witnessed and
studied the environmental devastation and multiple other effects of
long-standing civil war in each of these countries over many years. I left El
Salvador last September certain that my moment for launching this project is
now.</p>
<p>With
pleasure, I have the opportunity to focus eight years of working experience in
the Madre de Dios region into this vision. With excitement, I’m ready to share
it with those who want to join me in making a commitment to preserve in-tact

<h4>
<b>The art and heritage of the harvest cycle</b>
</h4>
<p></p>
<p>The
Brazil nut trees’ unique relationship to humans arises from it being the
producer of a non timber forest product that people have collected for hundreds
of years from the very trees that have produced for hundreds of years. By
comparison, most human activity in the forest that is not restorative
(reforestation) or protective (conservation and tourism) is in the long-run,
not sustainable, and most often harmful.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455148652/nddymavrr2naes9cl03w.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p>The annual Brazil nut harvest is an organic expression of cycles in the jungle and a
celebration of the cooperative exchange between humans and nature. However, this
exchange hinges on a delicate balance of variables that add up to the necessity
for keeping the forest healthy. With the balanced activities of the agouti and
the orchid bee, along with sustainable harvesting practices, the trees
regenerate and thrive.</p>
<p><b>The collection process:</b></p>
<p>During
the early months of the new year, the ripe Brazil nuts housed in wooden spheres
called “cocos” weighing roughly 2 kilos free-fall in a dramatic showering from
massive heights, slippery and wet with rain. Meanwhile in town, teams of
harvesters purchase food and assemble sleeping and cooking supplies in preparation
for the approaching 4-6 week work-period spent in the deep forest under the
colossal canopy.</p>
<p>Once in
the forest, the team spends nights sharpening machetes by the light of the fire
while discussing the following day’s tactics in consideration of the intricate
tree inventory map, a master plan that includes strategically placed collection
centers spread over 3000 acres. Days are spent alternately, one day collecting
the cocos into huge mounds, and the next, sitting on the forest floor,
back-to-back with a partner or against a tree, opening the cocos that demand
several hard machete strikes to yield.</p>
<p>For many
who work the nuts the next step is to simply sell them to one of the large
nut companies. This implies a limited value for their labor, falling to the
whim of market prices for the year. For others, further efforts might be taken
to dry and remove the nut’s inner shell, these steps increasing slightly, the
value of their labor. </p>

native groups and locals have survived in for centuries. Loggers and gold
miners mix with many of the worlds leading scientists, conservationists and
tour companies. The number of attorneys, copy centers, office supply stores and
bureaucratic offices with long lines and brutal wait times intimate the
defensive, survival of the fittest climate of living day-to-day against a
priceless backdrop of one of the earth’s most critical landscapes. All these
collide in a town that hums at the pace of a bee hive, where competing players
from wide interests are known to eat and drink in the same restaurants and bars

<p></p>
<p>Conservation

<b>Are you a scientist? </b><p></p>
<p>Ha, that
makes me laugh! Rather, I’ve spent a lion’s share of time in bureaucratic
offices over 8 years while connected to several projects. I’ve tenaciously and
successfully attended to paper work and requirements necessary to stay in
compliance with government agencies, while forming forward reaching business
relationships. I truthfully tell friends that I’ve spent more time with my
Peruvian attorney in the last 8 years than with any other person in my life. However,
I’ve met many scientists who do the important work of studying the region by carefully
cataloging its rich resources while recording the impact and consequences of
rapid change.<br/></p>
<p><b> Why are Brazil nut trees in Peru? Do
they grow elsewhere?</b></p>
<p>In short, the tree does not recognize borders. The trees
grow widely in healthy forest in Peru, Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia and Venezuela.
In SE Peru, the tree and the nut are called “castaña”. The castaña trees are
widely dispersed across the rainforest, growing in clusters of 50 to 100 or so
individuals.. The harvesters are called “castañeros” and a high density area of
the trees is called a “castañal”. Its’ scientific name is Bertholletia excelsa</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p><b>What are the benefits to the region and its people?</b></p>
<p>The people who depend on the forest for their livelihoods must be incentivized to preserve the forest instead of converting the land to other uses such as unsustainable timber harvesting, single crop farming or cattle ranching. Securing and maintaining a fair price for Brazil nuts through certification processes that bring a better price at market is a significant step forward towards assuring that the trees live, thrive, reproduce and produce.</p>

Short Summary

 

 Let’s put conservation of primary rainforest into the limelight. An invitation to be a part of a long-term conservation project with revolutionary consequences.





Social Entrepreneurism
Given the
conditions under which these trees grow, it’s hard to find a more “organic”
product than the Brazil nut. With a yet to be popularized forest product at our
finger tips, a food that originates from nature’s heights and vast wilds,
infused with the potency of the rainy season, we have the essential ingredient
to make this a successful business while meeting our first-line mission.


While
there is no single or conclusive definition of social entrepreneurism, our
intention in using it to capture our business model is to highlight Santa
Tierra Castañal’s central mission of meeting important environmental and social
goals. Protecting primary forest in Peru’s Mother of God region and increasing
the value of our team’s expertise while preserving the art of Brazil nut
harvesting are the first measures of our bottom line success. Yet, to be
sustainable without on-going cyclical fundraisers beyond this crowd funding
launch, (which would nudge it into the non-profit sector), we must make the
venture healthy and profitable into the future. 









Paula Givan, the foundation and the vision



As a North American I’ve carried purpose and a passion to act as a change agent by ushering in an impactful project.

My
relationship to Peru’s SE jungle started in 2008 with more than a decade of
travels throughout the country already under my belt. The art, poetry and
heritage of the Brazil nut trees touched me from the start. 
Returning
to Colorado from Peru in September of 2015, one of more than 40 trips spanning
20 years, I flew by way of El Salvador where decades ago, my relationship with
Latin America began. My head nodded to my life-long commitment to Latin
American studies and Spanish language fluency while my heart paused with the
memories of people I knew and loved during my formative years in both El Salvador
and  Guatemala. I’ve witnessed and
studied the environmental devastation and multiple other effects of
long-standing civil war in each of these countries over many years. I left El
Salvador last September certain that my moment for launching this project is
now.
With
pleasure, I have the opportunity to focus eight years of working experience in
the Madre de Dios region into this vision. With excitement, I’m ready to share
it with those who want to join me in making a commitment to preserve in-tact
forest. 
I hold a
degree in Small Business Management and Entrepreneurship from the University of
Colorado in Boulder.
My Modern
Languages degree comes from Metropolitan State University of Denver.
I’ve
earned an unofficial Latin American Studies degree over decades of personal
investigation and research, travel and direct experience.

</div></div>","Cheetah conservation status 

The estimated number of wild cheetahs in South Africa is around 500 and there are only around 7500 remaining in the wild in Africa.  With wild cheetah populations are losing their fight for survival as a result of continued habitat destruction and the depletion of genetic viability, every wild cheetah is super important.  Each individual animal’s life should be protected and conserved as they could very well represent the last of their kind; they could just contain the genes necessary to ensure the survival of their species that has been fighting a losing battle for survival against the need of the super species; Man.


Who are we: 

My name is Louise Joubert and I am the founder trustee of the SanWild Wildlife Trust in South Africa.  Our trust was formed in 2000 as a non-profit wild animal welfare and emergency rescue center and to provide a safe natural habitat sanctuary where wild animals could be giving a 2nd chance so that they can live wild and free amongst their own kind.  More about us on our website www.sanwild.org or our blog www.sanwildsite.wordpress.com 
Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/SanWild-Wildlife-Sanctuary/163363760361196?ref=hl


    What we need:

Cheetahs in South Africa are under serious threat and it is essential to establish viable breeding populations in the wild.  
SanWild has successfully rehabilitated and released two male cheetahs in our reserve, but they lack female company and cannot contribute to the survival of their species and the overall genetic viability of their own kind.  
SanWild is one of only a handful of reserves approved as bona fide cheetah conservation project and with this comes a conservation responsibility to help increase the number of cheetahs in the wild. 
We have managed to secure two suitable females that can be joined up with our males to start a breeding program in the wild that will allow us to help increase the population of cheetahs in protected private reserves.  




The required permits have been issued by the local nature
conservation departments and we do have the endorsement and approval of one of
South Africa's largest conservation bodies namely the Endangered Wildlife
Trust.
The two female cheetah are ready for relocation and this
will be done the moment the necessary funding has been raised.
We need to raise $12 000 US to relocate, rehabilitate and to introduce the females to the males before all four animals are returned to the wild to breed naturally.


The costs:



Temporary holding camp: $4 800.00
Transportation: 1300km:  $2 500.00
Rehabilitation and food:    $2 000.00
Ongoing support:                $ 2 000.00
Veterinary fees:                   $     700.00

<p><b>Short Version: </b>For
several years now, honeybees and wild bees have been vanishing. But the pollination they
provide is essential to the growth of numberless fruits and
vegetables.  We’re
working on an educational card game and accompanying information kit
about what we can do to protect the bees, and we need funds to print
it and offer it to schools for free. (<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/save-the-bees--27/#longversion"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Scroll down for the long version</a>)</p>

But
if you really want to make a difference, we propose that you not only
get your copy of the game, but that you have an educational kit sent
<b>in your name to the school of your choice</b>
– maybe the one you went to, or the one your kids attend.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Not
only will the school receive the educational kits, we’ll
follow through with them throughout the school year in order to help
facilitate things and gather their feedback so that at the end of the
year we can take into account what they think could be improved.  And
they’ll
get free access to any and all modifications we make to the digital

<h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://www.luanagames.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/bee-mini.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: bottom;""/> The project</h3>
<p>
Last
year, we created the “Women
in Science” card
game, which fights against prejudice by highlighting some 44
remarkable women scientists.  Thanks to the <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/women-in-science-card-game"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">phenomenal support we received from the Internet</a>, in just a few months we printed thousands
of card packs and offered over 800 of them to schools and
associations all over the world, for free.  It was a great experience, and it showed us
the road we’re
going to keep following.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
For
our second game, we wanted to find a cause that would have the same
kind of positive impact on society.  Everyone’s
heard about the problems bees are having right now: even if you’re
not especially interested in insects, the collapse of bee colonies
and the importance they have for food production are familiar facts.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
And
I think that most people would like to help, would like to do
something.  The problem is that we don’t
know what to do to save the bees.  As it happens, I studied
entomology when I was younger –
in fact, I
almost became a beekeeper –
and it
occurred to me that a game could bring together everything that the
man and woman in the street can do to save the bees.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Things
as simple as letting part of the lawn grow, planting the right kinds
of flowers at the right moment, or setting up a water source or a
bee shelter in your garden, and so on.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
But
that isn’t
all.  Playing games is a great way to sensitise people: it’s
not aggressive, and our natural curiosity does all the work.  But
where it really takes off –
and this is
what we learnt during our last fundraiser –
is when
teachers decide to use the game in the classroom.  When that happens,
you sensitise about thirty students per class, and often their
parents as well.  And should the teacher happen to share the game
with a few colleagues, you just brought your message to several
hundred people with a minimal investment.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
And
that’s
what we’re
hoping to do again here.</p>
<br/>

<div> <h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://www.luanagames.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/bee-mini.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: bottom;""/> Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>
We’ve
already got experience when it comes to printing and distributing
card games and books, so no problems on that front.  When it comes to
the scientific facts about protecting bees, we’ll
be asking experts (entomologists, beekeepers, researchers) to check
and validate the information we’re

The feedback we get for this campaign isn't what we expected. We need to do better, so we are going back to the drawing board. We want to thank our backers (you will get 100% of your money back of course!) and all those who shared this project. We apologize for this and will come back with a better project. Thank you all!






Short Version: For
several years now, honeybees and wild bees have been vanishing. But the pollination they
provide is essential to the growth of numberless fruits and
vegetables.  We’re
working on an educational card game and accompanying information kit
about what we can do to protect the bees, and we need funds to print
it and offer it to schools for free. (Scroll down for the long version)

 Sponsoring a school

But
if you really want to make a difference, we propose that you not only
get your copy of the game, but that you have an educational kit sent
in your name to the school of your choice
– maybe the one you went to, or the one your kids attend.



Not
only will the school receive the educational kits, we’ll
follow through with them throughout the school year in order to help
facilitate things and gather their feedback so that at the end of the
year we can take into account what they think could be improved.  And
they’ll
get free access to any and all modifications we make to the digital
version, forever!




$120
 USD + Shipping


Minimal school pack

- 1 STB game pack for you

- Access to all the digital versions that can be downloaded and printed
on your own, both for you and the school, along with all future
updates
- Follow-up and support offered to the school
Printing the packs of cards is what would make the most work for the teachers if they had to do it themselves.  With ten packs, a whole class of 30 to 40 students can play at the same time as well as be taught the educational side of things, and the activity can be passed from class to class to reach hundreds of students

For a larger school, for instance one that teaches both
primary/elementary school and middle-grade or high school, it’s
better to offer more in the way of supplies so that several classes
can enjoy the activity at the same time.  We also include a series of
educational posters that can be used to mount an exhibit or simply
decorate classrooms.








 

 The project

Last
year, we created the “Women
in Science” card
game, which fights against prejudice by highlighting some 44
remarkable women scientists.  Thanks to the phenomenal support we received from the Internet, in just a few months we printed thousands
of card packs and offered over 800 of them to schools and
associations all over the world, for free.  It was a great experience, and it showed us
the road we’re
going to keep following.



For
our second game, we wanted to find a cause that would have the same
kind of positive impact on society.  Everyone’s
heard about the problems bees are having right now: even if you’re
not especially interested in insects, the collapse of bee colonies
and the importance they have for food production are familiar facts.



And
I think that most people would like to help, would like to do
something.  The problem is that we don’t
know what to do to save the bees.  As it happens, I studied
entomology when I was younger –
in fact, I
almost became a beekeeper –
and it
occurred to me that a game could bring together everything that the
man and woman in the street can do to save the bees.



Things
as simple as letting part of the lawn grow, planting the right kinds
of flowers at the right moment, or setting up a water source or a
bee shelter in your garden, and so on.







But
that isn’t
all.  Playing games is a great way to sensitise people: it’s
not aggressive, and our natural curiosity does all the work.  But
where it really takes off –
and this is
what we learnt during our last fundraiser –
is when
teachers decide to use the game in the classroom.  When that happens,
you sensitise about thirty students per class, and often their
parents as well.  And should the teacher happen to share the game
with a few colleagues, you just brought your message to several
hundred people with a minimal investment.



And
that’s
what we’re
hoping to do again here.


 
 Risks & Challenges

We’ve
already got experience when it comes to printing and distributing
card games and books, so no problems on that front.  When it comes to
the scientific facts about protecting bees, we’ll
be asking experts (entomologists, beekeepers, researchers) to check
and validate the information we’re
passing on.  Lastly, when it comes to the game itself, we’ll
be calling on beta testers to make sure that it’s
not only fun, but that we’ve
considered all possible outcomes before we release the finalised
version.



The
fact remains that this type of project can always suffer from
unexpected delays.  We’d
rather deliver things a little late than to offer a product we’re
not proud of.  In our last campaign, supplementary delays tended to
last about two weeks.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Access to a reliable energy source is essential for
development, but after decades upheaval the construction of energy
infrastructure in Cambodia has been slow. Currently roughly a quarter of the
population have access to the centralized electricity grid, meaning that
roughly 10.6 million Cambodians, mostly in the rural areas, live without.</p>
<p>They resort to using kerosene lanterns, car batteries and
diesel generators, which are expensive, time consuming, detrimental to health
and often downright dangerous.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Kerosene presents a significant fire hazard, its fumes have
adverse health effects, especially for women who may spend long periods of time
indoors, and the light from kerosene lanterns is of poor quality which makes it
difficult to study or perform other potential earning activities.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Car batteries require regular re-charging which can be very
time consuming as the nearest charging station is often several miles away,
again taking up valuable time which could be better spent on other activities.</span><br/>

<p><b>L’accès à
l’énergie au Cambodge</b></p>
<p>L’accès à une
source d’énergie pérenne est essentiel au développement. Cependant, le pays
demeure encore en reconstruction à la suite du régime khmer rouge et le
déploiement des infrastructures énergétiques au Cambodge reste très limité.
Actuellement, à peine un quart de la population à accès au
réseau électrique. 10,6 millions de Cambodgiens, la majorité en zone rurale,
n’ont donc pas accès à l’électricité du réseau.</p>
<p>Pour s’éclairer,
ces populations ont recours à des lampes à kérosène, des batteries de voitures
ou des générateurs diesel. Ces solutions, souvent plus onéreuses que
l’électricité du réseau, peuvent également s’avérer dangereuse :</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Les
lampes à kérosène représentent un risque d’incendie majeur. Elles émettent des
fumées nocives, surtout pour les femmes au foyer et les enfants en bas-âge restant
de longues heures à l’intérieur. Ces lampes apportent de plus un éclairage
faible ne suffisant pas aux enfants pour étudier le soir et ne permettant pas
aux adultes de travailler à la nuit tombée.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Les
batteries de voiture nécessitent des recharges régulières. La station de recharge
la plus proche se trouvant généralement à plusieurs kilomètres, chaque recharge
prend un temps précieux pendant lequel aucune autre activité lucrative ne peut
être envisagée.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>L’utilisation
de générateur diesel est quant à elle complètement hors de prix pour la plupart
des personnes et demande un apport constant en kérosène. </p>

When sharing on twitter please add this link to your tweet: http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/552440Energy Access in Cambodia
Access to a reliable energy source is essential for
development, but after decades upheaval the construction of energy
infrastructure in Cambodia has been slow. Currently roughly a quarter of the
population have access to the centralized electricity grid, meaning that
roughly 10.6 million Cambodians, mostly in the rural areas, live without.
They resort to using kerosene lanterns, car batteries and
diesel generators, which are expensive, time consuming, detrimental to health
and often downright dangerous.


Kerosene presents a significant fire hazard, its fumes have
adverse health effects, especially for women who may spend long periods of time
indoors, and the light from kerosene lanterns is of poor quality which makes it
difficult to study or perform other potential earning activities.


Car batteries require regular re-charging which can be very
time consuming as the nearest charging station is often several miles away,
again taking up valuable time which could be better spent on other activities.


The use of diesel generators is expensive and rquire constant purchase of fuel.


Solar Power is Part of the AnswerAs Cambodia is located in one of the sunniest areas of the
world, solar power provides an excellent solution to these problems: it’s safe;
reliable; and easy to use. Also, after the initial expenditure the running
costs are negligible.The quality of light from our solar lighting kits empowers
people by allowing them to continue studying or engaging in other earning
activities (such as making handicrafts or running a local shop) after the sun
has gone down.
The lighting kits we provide are plug-and-play which means
they are easy to install and easy to use. They are also expandable which means
that it is easy for customers to add to their system when the have the money
and their needs grow.
What We Need & What You Get
We aim to increase customer access to these
technologies by building a distribution service to reach these rural
communities. This is where we need your help. By creating a network and having
a local presence, we can start to build trust for solar products and show their
benefits over existing energy solutions. We want to start with a shop in
Kampong Thom where we have a partnership with a local MFI to make the products
more affordable. We will employ a local entrepreneurs to
run the shop and sell in the field, and hope to cover the costs to run for a 6
month pilot period, in which time we hope to be an established part of the
community and a trusted  source of clean energy solutions.
We will use your money to open our ""Solar Shop"", our base for supporting our network of entrepreneurs. We will host trainings and provide education and awareness raising about solar. We will also have technical support staff to provide (after-)sales support and maintenance for the end-user.
Cost Breakdown:- Office Setup $967- Staff Salaries (6 Months) $3000- Operation Costs (6 Months) $2196- Inventory $3450-----------------------------Total $9613More info on this project: http://nrg-renewables.com/category/distribution-network/
We are passionate about this project as it is the best way to go
spread solar throughout Cambodia. We are will work tirelessly to make it happen with whatever funding we can raise, but obviously the more the better!If you have ANY questions, or would like to know more about this project, please email us today.

Our StoryNRG Solutions was established with the goal of providing appropriate and affordable solar energy solutions to Cambodia.We are a small entrepreneurial mix of Khmer and International staff, we started 4 years ago as part of an NGO, and after testing different models and approaches to the distribution of solar energy into remote areas, we took the decision to transition into a social enterrise, order to make the model more sustainable and scalable.We are building networks of entrepreneurs to whom we offer constant training and support and push our emphasis on quality and service. By engaging local people in our model, not only do we create jobs and give people new skills, but also expand our reach deeper into the remote rural areas where solar can make the most difference.We have quickly gained a reputation for  this focus on top quality products and for  providing excellent after-sales service and  maintenance for the end-customer. This  allows us to gain trust from the  communities we work, which is especially  important when bad products and poor  service have given solar a bad name.Learn about previous projects: http://nrg-renewables.com/category/projects/Other Ways You Can HelpSpread the word!

The Fat Trap - the no hassle, fat collector!

Millions of pounds each year are wasted in the UK unblocking pipes of congealed fat. This is due to the increasing number of people tipping cooking fats and oils down drains, which leads to many environmental risks, including flooding.
Waste fat and oil in the kitchen can be harmful in so many ways. Even though you may not see it, fat and oil will harbour germs and make surfaces dangerous.
 

 
Now we have the answer… Fattrap
The super absorbent cooking oil disposal pouch ‘Fat Trap’ (Fattrap) locks in waste fats and oils from health grills, BBQs, frying, roasting dishes and kitchen spillages into it’s honeycomb structure. This turns the waste into a solid, for easy and safe disposal into the bin.

Our latest innovation!
From The Happy Bird Company comes Eco Bird Biscuit
 

 
THE BIRD FOOD MARKET IS HUGE. IN THE UK OVER £300 MILLION PER YEAR AND OVER 55 MILLION AMERICANS FEED WILD BIRDS AND SPEND OVER $3 BILLION A YEAR ON BIRD FOOD. 
At the same time in the UK alone households pour an estimated 170,000 tonnes of waste cooking fat and oil down the kitchen sink each year using hot water and detergents to flush down into the waste pipes where once cooled it will solidify.In the USA it is estimated that 40-60% of all preventable Sewage System Overflows nationwide are fats,oils and grease (FOG)-related. The environmental impact is huge and can even lead to extensive flooding.
Recycle your waste cooking fat and oil into nutritious and safe food for the birds - how good is that!
A new and innovative product that not only makes birds happy, but also makes the environment happy.
Bird lovers and gardeners alike will love this interactive and addictive new way to feed the birds
It's a simple and fun way to make high nutrition biscuits in the home…biscuits guaranteed to have all kinds of birds flocking to the garden.
 

Eco Bird Biscuit can help feed the declining wild bird population by providing safe and highly nutritious food whilst diverting 000's  tonnes of waste cooking fats and oils from our sewer systems and landfill.

All that’s needed is some water but better still for extra nutrition add some waste cooking fat or oil. 60 seconds in a  microwave binds all the elements together to literally bake a fantastic high energy biscuit that birds love.
There’s nothing quite like Eco Bird Biscuit available anywhere else. It’s the only complete kit of its kind. The fact that the biscuit when made is hard and dry means that—unlike ready-made fat balls and suet cakes — they don’t melt in hot weather and the birds don’t smear their feathers on the fat.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>The Human Rights Defense Center’s <a href=""http://nationinside.org/campaign/prison-ecology/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Prison Ecology Project</a> is creating tools to dismantle toxic prisons. We are focused on organizing at the intersection of environment and mass incarceration. Your contributions will provide needed start-up funds for on-the-ground work to bridge the gap between criminal justice reform and environmental movements. </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The prison industry has a long history of ecological violence. Rikers Island prison in <a href=""https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2012/feb/15/rikers-island-guards-file-suit-alleging-cancer-causing-toxin-exposure/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">New York City </a>was literally built on a trash heap, and evidence suggests a high incidence of cancer among guards and prisoners. In <a href=""https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2011/aug/15/california-prisoners-still-forced-to-drink-arsenic-laced-water/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">California</a> and <a href=""http://gritsforbreakfast.blogspot.com/2014/09/well-water-contaminated-with-arsenic-at.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Texas</a> prisoners have little recourse but to drink arsenic-laced water. In <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xEcfx8DMZw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Alabama</a>, an overpopulated prison habitually dumps sewage into a river where people fish and swim. In <a href=""https://www.humanrightsdefensecenter.org/action/news/2015/hrdc-files-comment-opposing-federal-prison-siting-former-coal-mine-kentucky/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kentucky</a>, construction of a new prison is poised to clear 700 acres of endangered species habitat. Stories like these are too common. The issues impact millions of people in and around prisons across the US but are largely ignored. </p>
<p><a href=""http://nationinside.org/campaign/prison-ecology/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Prison Ecology Project</a> is uncovering these abuses and building a clearinghouse of data you can use to fight toxic prisons in your community. </p>
<p>We are a project of the Human Rights Defense Center (HRDC), a national non-profit that advocates for protecting the fundamental rights of people held in U.S. detention facilities, including their access to communications from outside sources. For 25 years, HRDC has published <i><a href=""http://www.prisonlegalnews.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Prison Legal News</a></i>, a monthly publication with subscribers in all 50 states and internationally. HRDC engages in litigation, conducts media and educational campaigns, provides testimony before legislative and regulatory bodies, and also does significant work around government transparency and accountability issues.

<p></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p><span>We are raising $15,000 to boost our research and data analysis work in this chronically understudied area, and to keep pressure on an industry notorious for its lack of transparency. </span></p>
<p>If we meet our stretch goal of $25,000, your donations will also fund our organizing work to halt the construction of new prisons. Our first target? A <a href=""http://nationinside.org/campaign/prison-ecology/posts/updates-from-the-fight-to-stop-a-new-toxic-prison-in-central-appalachia/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">federal prison planned for Letcher County, Kentucky</a> whose construction would demolish 700 acres of endangered species habitat in Appalachia while imprisoning people hundreds of miles from their families. If we raise these funds, we will plan an organizing tour across the southeast to mobilize against the permitting of this prison.<br/></p>We are offering special gifts to our backers! Check out our list of perks available as thanks for your contributions. You can find out more about the perks in our <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/prison-ecology-project/x/11485634#/gallery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">gallery</a>. <br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441314991/ciqakajf66uxohzm2eut.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p><a href=""http://nationinside.org/campaign/prison-ecology/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Prison Ecology Project</a> is building a database of the five thousand prisons and jails around the country, finding the weak points in the environmental realm, and providing tools to organize locally. </p>
<p>Incarcerated people are one of the most vulnerable and uniquely over-burdened demographics in our nation. Prisons have become a big business. One fourth of the world’s prisoners are locked up in the US, where the the number of prisons has shot up by 500% in the last thirty years. Almost all of the prison population is low-income, and people of color are disproportionately represented by wide margins in every state. </p>
<p>Most people whose lives have been impacted by the criminal justice system have not engaged with the environmental movement up to the present time. The Prison Ecology Project creates an entryway for them, as we are able to illustrate that the environmental toll of building and operating prisons indicates yet another reason to massively reduce the nation’s prison populations and send people back to their families. Thus, an additional result of the project: the growth of the environmental movement.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The prison industry is entrenched in US government and society, but is not untouchable. The <a href=""https://www.humanrightsdefensecenter.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Human Rights Defense Center</a> (HRDC) already succeeded in wielding large scale influence in the regulatory arena through the <a href=""https://www.prisonphonejustice.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Prison Phone Justice Campaign</a>, which zeroed in on price gouging by telecom companies in collusion with prisons and jails. Its data collection and analysis were central to getting the FCC to reduce inflated prison phone rates and safeguard the lifeline between the incarcerated and their loved ones. HRDC is also the publisher of <i><a href=""http://prisonlegalnews.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/search/?q=&amp;selected_facets=tags%3AEnvironmental+Law&amp;selected_facets=&amp;selected_facets=facet_model_name%3AArticles&amp;selected_facets=&amp;selected_facets="" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Prison Legal News</a></i>, which has exposed environmental problems and covered stories of whistleblower litigation in prisons for well over two decades. The <a href=""http://nationinside.org/campaign/prison-ecology/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Prison Ecology Project</a> aims to build on this kind of success.<br/></p>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you missed the crowdfunding campaign, but still want to donate, you can do so through Prison Legal News (Please make note that you want to direct the funds towards the Prison Ecology Project) .  CLICK HERE TO DONATE. 
Become a part
of this growing movement to end mass incarceration and defend the earth. Your
money will go towards:
1. 
Exposing
the prison system for poisoning incarcerated people
and destroying the environment

2. 
Organizing 
to engage local communities and create new tools,
including a national database of toxic prisons and prison pollution

3. 
Fighting
The construction of new prisons that tear apart human
communities and damage ecosystems

4. 
Protecting
Wildlife, waterways and the habitat of endangered species,
such as the Indiana bat threatened by a new federal prison in southern
Appalachia 
$15,000 will give us resources to move forward on these four
fronts. Read on for more details...  

Summary

The Human Rights Defense Center’s Prison Ecology Project is creating tools to dismantle toxic prisons. We are focused on organizing at the intersection of environment and mass incarceration. Your contributions will provide needed start-up funds for on-the-ground work to bridge the gap between criminal justice reform and environmental movements. 

The prison industry has a long history of ecological violence. Rikers Island prison in New York City was literally built on a trash heap, and evidence suggests a high incidence of cancer among guards and prisoners. In California and Texas prisoners have little recourse but to drink arsenic-laced water. In Alabama, an overpopulated prison habitually dumps sewage into a river where people fish and swim. In Kentucky, construction of a new prison is poised to clear 700 acres of endangered species habitat. Stories like these are too common. The issues impact millions of people in and around prisons across the US but are largely ignored. 
Prison Ecology Project is uncovering these abuses and building a clearinghouse of data you can use to fight toxic prisons in your community. 
We are a project of the Human Rights Defense Center (HRDC), a national non-profit that advocates for protecting the fundamental rights of people held in U.S. detention facilities, including their access to communications from outside sources. For 25 years, HRDC has published Prison Legal News, a monthly publication with subscribers in all 50 states and internationally. HRDC engages in litigation, conducts media and educational campaigns, provides testimony before legislative and regulatory bodies, and also does significant work around government transparency and accountability issues. Read more about HRDC’s history, staff, and extensive work on its website.

   What We Need & What You Get 
We are raising $15,000 to boost our research and data analysis work in this chronically understudied area, and to keep pressure on an industry notorious for its lack of transparency. 
If we meet our stretch goal of $25,000, your donations will also fund our organizing work to halt the construction of new prisons. Our first target? A federal prison planned for Letcher County, Kentucky whose construction would demolish 700 acres of endangered species habitat in Appalachia while imprisoning people hundreds of miles from their families. If we raise these funds, we will plan an organizing tour across the southeast to mobilize against the permitting of this prison.We are offering special gifts to our backers! Check out our list of perks available as thanks for your contributions. You can find out more about the perks in our gallery. 
  The Impact 
Prison Ecology Project is building a database of the five thousand prisons and jails around the country, finding the weak points in the environmental realm, and providing tools to organize locally. 
Incarcerated people are one of the most vulnerable and uniquely over-burdened demographics in our nation. Prisons have become a big business. One fourth of the world’s prisoners are locked up in the US, where the the number of prisons has shot up by 500% in the last thirty years. Almost all of the prison population is low-income, and people of color are disproportionately represented by wide margins in every state. 
Most people whose lives have been impacted by the criminal justice system have not engaged with the environmental movement up to the present time. The Prison Ecology Project creates an entryway for them, as we are able to illustrate that the environmental toll of building and operating prisons indicates yet another reason to massively reduce the nation’s prison populations and send people back to their families. Thus, an additional result of the project: the growth of the environmental movement.   Risks & Challenges The prison industry is entrenched in US government and society, but is not untouchable. The Human Rights Defense Center (HRDC) already succeeded in wielding large scale influence in the regulatory arena through the Prison Phone Justice Campaign, which zeroed in on price gouging by telecom companies in collusion with prisons and jails. Its data collection and analysis were central to getting the FCC to reduce inflated prison phone rates and safeguard the lifeline between the incarcerated and their loved ones. HRDC is also the publisher of Prison Legal News, which has exposed environmental problems and covered stories of whistleblower litigation in prisons for well over two decades. The Prison Ecology Project aims to build on this kind of success.
    Other Ways You Can Help Please spread the word! A crowdfunding campaign is as good as the crowd behind it. Use the Indiegogo social media tools. Tell your friends. Talk to your family. Share our campaign with your networks! Your efforts are key to our success.

<strong>CLIMAFY'S MISSION:</strong> <em>To “make green happen”, </em><em>boost the value of a home, and shrink or eliminate personal carbon footprints </em><em>by providing an online software platform to help simplify the complex process of making a home more energy efficient.</em>
</h3>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><strong>Upgrading your house to improve its energy efficiency can be hard. Climafy makes it easy.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Climafy is a  new service that helps you to save money on your utilities, raise the value of your house, and lower your carbon footprint</strong>. Upon sharing a few details about your house, we will help you to improve your property's energy efficiency from start to finish. You might be surprised by how much money you can save in the future by installing appropriate insulation, wind turbines, furnaces, and other upgrades now.</p>
<p><strong>We want to empower as many homeowners as possible to take control of their </strong><strong>energy use</strong>. Unanswered questions about costs, savings, incentives, and technology should not stop anyone from making changes important to their financial well-being. Climafy gathers more information about prices and incentives than is available in any other place. Through Climafy, you will be able to quickly and easily make financial decisions that are right for you and your home.</p>
<p><strong>Our partnerships with contractors and lending institutions</strong> will enable a smooth process of selecting, financing, installing, and monitoring the upgrades that will create the most meaningful difference for your house and your utility bills. Climafy accommodates everyone, including those deeply interested in the details of energy efficiency. Others, on the other hand, would rather let us figure everything out, and that's okay. With Climafy, you can go at your own pace and still make green happen at the click of a button.</p>
<p><strong>Climafy is an ambitious project with significant outstanding development to </strong><strong>prepare for our first customers</strong>. We are a small dynamic team, and have been developing Climafy's technology over the past three years without any outside investment. With your help, we can launch the service in Spring, 2013. We would like to maintain the highest standards of quality from the first moment we help anyone to Climafy their home. We must focus as much of our time as possible on Climafy and set up an office to facilitate the hard work that will make it a success.</p>
<p>In exchange for your support, we are offering an opportunity to experience the highest level of Climafy service, called Direct Access. Starting at a pledge of only $25, you will have access to a member of our team whenever you decide to Climafy your home. Larger pledges will allow you more time with us when you decide to use Climafy. Starting at the $50 pledge level, you can give the gift of resource efficiency and personal service to anyone you choose.</p>
<p>Once the project is fully funded, we will send you a code by email for each Direct Access account associated with your pledge. We will also send you instructions for activating your code.</p>
<p>In the future, Direct Access will comprise our top-tier level of service.  We will never again be able to offer it at the prices we are offering now to our Kickstarter supporters. We want to show our sincere appreciation for your help in funding the development of Climafy.                                                               </p>
<p><strong>Our pilot cities are <em>Pittsburgh, PA</em>, and <em>Hartford, CT</em></strong>; homeowners in those two areas will currently experience the greatest ease-of-use because we have incorporated detailed property information into our database, but homeowners elsewhere can still use Climafy by providing a few more inputs than their street address and zipcode.  Both work equally well with our industry-standard energy efficiency modeling engine.</p>
<div>
<p>We truly appreciate the support; keep an eye out for updates throughout our campaign.</p>

This campaign is about closing “the sustainability loop” on an island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Specifically, a unique facility on Kauai Island involves the application of a proprietary pyrolysis technology to process Albizia wood chips into heat energy, gas and oil distillates, and carbon fractions. The heat energy will be used by a planned cold storage facility, the bio-derived gas and oil will be used by the power plant to generate electric power, and the carbon fraction will be packaged and sold as value-added carbon products.
We seek this funding to complete the initial project development work and create a viable project prospectus to present to interested investors. To date, we have completed:

Legal Formation
Design Level Engineering
Pyrolysis Oil Testing
Carbon Product Testing
The development work that remains includes:

Begin Project Permitting
Additional Engineering
Advanced Oil and Carbon Testing
Legal and Accounting
The Project Funding Campaign
This project features the physical completion of a dream that began more than 20 years ago, and opens the door to a truly Sustainable Forest - an environmental oasis on the island of Kauai - a system that is in keeping with a fair helping of each of the classic elements required for true human sustainability:

<p><b>Campaign
Description</b></p>
<p>In
Africa there are millions of unemployed and a lot of arid wasteland. <a href=""http://greenselfreliance.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Green
Self Reliance, Inc.</span></a> (GSR) has demonstrated the power of it is
possible to alleviate and reverse both conditions with its rural development
business model based on a successful prototype village project in The Democratic
Republic of Congo. Prior to launch in 2005 of the prototype, the entire
province of South Kivu was embroiled in civil war. The land was barren and laid
waste due to constant conflicts, and there was well over 98% unemployment.
Today, the prototype has spread across several villages in Ruzizi Valley and
has thousands of a prosperous and thriving members growing over 40+ varieties of
with an average of three to four harvests per year. We now hope to continue
this success by extending our operations to cover thousands of villages in
order to bring better work opportunities and living conditions. GSR will work
with millions of small farmers to rapidly improve the rural economy. These
small farmers have the motivation, energy and skill necessary to engage in
restorative agriculture.</p>
<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/32681/files/20130825084629-GSR_-_Distribution_Warehouse_Loaders.jpg?1377445589"" src="""" style=""width: 547.644px; height: 411px;""/></p>GSR’s <a href=""http://wp.me/p2Pu86-9e"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Sustainable
Restorative
Agriculture</span></a> (SRA)
model makes it possible for small farmers in rural Africa to more than triple their
income within a few years. Restorative agriculture is a hybrid system using
many cutting edge techniques from permaculture, sustainable agriculture,
appropriate technologies, and <a href=""http://wp.me/p2Pu86-9t"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>organic farming</span></a> practices. It is ideal for
making the soil more fertile and increasing crop yields substantially. Because
operations are small scale and keep sustainability in the forefront of our
minds, SRA has an added benefit of being a practical solution for making
agriculture environmental. Small farmers can therefore conserve and even reduce
the total amount resources needed for optimal farming.<br/><br/>GSR<em> helps empower rural communities
to </em>build adaptive sustainable green economies, to
help them re<em><span>solve</span></em> the
most pressing global economic challenges and environmental, such as the food
crisis and land degradation (due to climate change and desertification). We
offer education, training, infrastructure, and commercial, financial, and
consulting services to ensure the growth of rural economies. Here is our
formula for success:<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/32679/files/20130825084557-GSR_-_Small_Farms.jpg?1377445557"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<ul><li>Increase productivity
     and food quality significantly by introducing cost-effective organic
     farming techniques to improve substandard and depleted soil </li></ul><ul><li>Enable farmers to
     connect to markets by improving processing, storage, transport, warehousing
     and water retention infrastructure </li></ul><ul><li>Provide financial
     services and establish cooperative market systems</li></ul><ul><li>Introduce efficient,
     renewable green energy for a prosperous green economy</li></ul>Given
sufficient funding, GSR’s target is to ramp up our project to support 1,000 villages
within seven years of initial funding, and in the process help rural
communities enhance income and job opportunities for hundreds of millions of
people. Our restorative agriculture model is replicable, which means the more
financial support we get, the faster the project can grow.<br/><br/><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">

<p><i><b>What will be done with the
campaign funds?</b></i></p>
$50,000 is the barebones minimal funds needed for
GSR to conduct a proper assessment in Africa and apply for $100 Million
development funds. Without providing proper assessment data, it is difficult to
get the necessary funding and support for running our operations. We are
currently in talks with several African countries about running projects with
them. Some of these potential project sites are in Cameroon, Cote d’Ivoire,
Ghana, Sierra Leone and Gambia.<b><i><br/></i></b><br/><p><b><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/32677/files/20130825084517-GSR_-_Carpenter_Roofer.jpg?1377445517"" src="""" style=""""/></i></b></p>

<p><b><i>Who is GSR working with?</i></b></p>
<p>GSR
may be a new player in the development community; however we have already made
very critical connections to some of the world’s leading business, governance
and academic experts, some of whom sit on the board of advisors for GSR. Our project
proposals are currently being reviewed by a number of international development
agencies, including the <a href=""http://idc.co.za/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>IDC (Industrial
Development Corporation)</span></a> and the <a href=""http://www.dbsa.drm-za.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>DBSA (Development Bank of Southern Africa)</span></a>.</p>

<p>We’ve
recently received a letter of intent from IDC and look forward to working with
them to improve the manufacturing process of palm oil for small producers in
Ghana that is both sustainable and viable for local and global markets. We have
already over 25,000 small farmers ready to partner with GSR and this number
will grow. We’re also preparing a proposal for the <i>Government of India, Ministry of External Affairs for</i> major funding
support for our development projects in Africa.<span></span></p>
<p>GSR
has already received a number of invitation letters from governments in Africa
(including Sierra Leone) to help them sustainably expand their agricultural
production. We look forward to building a network of rural economies in Africa
to bolster the economic growth of rural communities so that they can become a
significant participant in the global market.</p>

Description
In
Africa there are millions of unemployed and a lot of arid wasteland. Green
Self Reliance, Inc. (GSR) has demonstrated the power of it is
possible to alleviate and reverse both conditions with its rural development
business model based on a successful prototype village project in The Democratic
Republic of Congo. Prior to launch in 2005 of the prototype, the entire
province of South Kivu was embroiled in civil war. The land was barren and laid
waste due to constant conflicts, and there was well over 98% unemployment.
Today, the prototype has spread across several villages in Ruzizi Valley and
has thousands of a prosperous and thriving members growing over 40+ varieties of
with an average of three to four harvests per year. We now hope to continue
this success by extending our operations to cover thousands of villages in
order to bring better work opportunities and living conditions. GSR will work
with millions of small farmers to rapidly improve the rural economy. These
small farmers have the motivation, energy and skill necessary to engage in
restorative agriculture.
GSR’s Sustainable
Restorative
Agriculture (SRA)
model makes it possible for small farmers in rural Africa to more than triple their
income within a few years. Restorative agriculture is a hybrid system using
many cutting edge techniques from permaculture, sustainable agriculture,
appropriate technologies, and organic farming practices. It is ideal for
making the soil more fertile and increasing crop yields substantially. Because
operations are small scale and keep sustainability in the forefront of our
minds, SRA has an added benefit of being a practical solution for making
agriculture environmental. Small farmers can therefore conserve and even reduce
the total amount resources needed for optimal farming.GSR helps empower rural communities
to build adaptive sustainable green economies, to
help them resolve the
most pressing global economic challenges and environmental, such as the food
crisis and land degradation (due to climate change and desertification). We
offer education, training, infrastructure, and commercial, financial, and
consulting services to ensure the growth of rural economies. Here is our
formula for success:


Increase productivity
     and food quality significantly by introducing cost-effective organic
     farming techniques to improve substandard and depleted soil Enable farmers to
     connect to markets by improving processing, storage, transport, warehousing
     and water retention infrastructure Provide financial
     services and establish cooperative market systemsIntroduce efficient,
     renewable green energy for a prosperous green economyGiven
sufficient funding, GSR’s target is to ramp up our project to support 1,000 villages
within seven years of initial funding, and in the process help rural
communities enhance income and job opportunities for hundreds of millions of
people. Our restorative agriculture model is replicable, which means the more
financial support we get, the faster the project can grow.
For more details see our website – www.greenselfreliance.com.
What will be done with the
campaign funds?
$50,000 is the barebones minimal funds needed for
GSR to conduct a proper assessment in Africa and apply for $100 Million
development funds. Without providing proper assessment data, it is difficult to
get the necessary funding and support for running our operations. We are
currently in talks with several African countries about running projects with
them. Some of these potential project sites are in Cameroon, Cote d’Ivoire,
Ghana, Sierra Leone and Gambia.
Stretch Goals
If
contributions exceed $100,000, GSR will start working on the ground immediately
after running the assessment. If our campaign receives $200,000, GSR will expand
our development project to a much larger area. 
Regardless of stretch goals, we will keep
contributors informed about the success of the project sites that they have
supported. Connect with us on social media and subscribe to our newsletter to
get regular updates. 
Who is GSR working with?
GSR
may be a new player in the development community; however we have already made
very critical connections to some of the world’s leading business, governance
and academic experts, some of whom sit on the board of advisors for GSR. Our project
proposals are currently being reviewed by a number of international development
agencies, including the IDC (Industrial
Development Corporation) and the DBSA (Development Bank of Southern Africa).

We’ve
recently received a letter of intent from IDC and look forward to working with
them to improve the manufacturing process of palm oil for small producers in
Ghana that is both sustainable and viable for local and global markets. We have
already over 25,000 small farmers ready to partner with GSR and this number
will grow. We’re also preparing a proposal for the Government of India, Ministry of External Affairs for major funding
support for our development projects in Africa.
GSR
has already received a number of invitation letters from governments in Africa
(including Sierra Leone) to help them sustainably expand their agricultural
production. We look forward to building a network of rural economies in Africa
to bolster the economic growth of rural communities so that they can become a
significant participant in the global market.

For
this crowdfunding campaign, GSR has teamed up with a number of socially
conscious organizations just to make sure we provide you with some of the best
quality green perks available on the market. When you contribute to our
campaign, you will not only be supporting GSR but our partners as well. By helping
us, you’ll be helping the green economy grow!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>Who is I.D.E.A.S. for UF?</b></p>
<p>I.D.E.A.S. for UF is a chapter of the international non-profit organization I.D.E.A.S. (Intellectual Decisions on Environmental Awareness Solutions). IDEAS is a youth-led movement that strives to advance sustainability and solve environmental problems through research (R&amp;D), action and awareness at universities, K-12 schools and communities across the World. At IDEAS for UF we nurture the talents of youth leaders to enact innovative ideas and solve the integrated energy, environmental and economic problems in their community. Through a network of educational institutions, green businesses and community organizations, IDEAS provides the resources and support needed for young people to create positive environmental change and bring a culture of sustainability on campus and in the community.</p>
<p>FUN FACT:  At Power Shift 2011 the I.D.E.A.S. organization held their own seminar on Kill-a-Watt Energy Challenge and how it was able to spread across Florida and expand into other states.  Also featured were the unique initiatives that I.D.E.A.S. coordinates, such as Upcycling, Ecosystem clean-ups, and IDEAS for Education.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Why are we a part of the Power Shift movement &amp;what will we achieve?</b></p>
<p>Power Shift 2013 will bring together over 10,000 youth leaders to learn, brainstorm, and ultimately develop a movement for a clean energy economy.  Power Shift 2013 will launch hundreds of sustained campaigns and mass actions to demand climate justice.</p>
<p>With your help we will return from Power Shift with the resources, knowledge, and support needed to stop the environmental and economic downward spiral we are currently in with the fossil fuel industry. We will take action at the University of Florida and Gainesville area, then in the surrounding Alachua county area and beyond, to reinvest in clean energy and socially responsible alternatives to fossil fuels.  Both the University of Florida and the City of Gainesville’s energy contract will be up for renewal soon.  One of our immediate goals will be to start a campaign that will allow for more forms of alternative to be included in the new contracts. Your donations will help empower us so we make our plans a reality, and help build a future we can all be proud of.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p></p>
<p>Our goal is to get 50 students from the University of Florida and the surrounding Gainesville area to Pittsburgh to attend Power Shift 2013, but we need YOUR help! </p>
<p>To accommodate this large group we will need to rent a bus for transportation and book a hotel for lodging.  With this campaign we are specifically trying to raise money to cover our lodging, which we have estimated to be about 5000 dollars.  We plan to book 10 rooms with 5 people per room for Saturday and Sunday night.</p>
<p>We are working on other ways to raise money to cover transportation costs.  One of our fundraising techniques will involve our bike-powered sewing machine that we use to turn old t-shirts into handy, reusable tote bags!  We plan to set up at the Union Street Farmers Market Downtown on Wednesday afternoons and at the Alachua County Farmers Market on Saturday mornings on to give people the opportunity to use the bike-powered sewing machine and make their own reusable tote bags that can be used while they shop.  While we will be collecting donations, this will also be an educational and outreach event to get people to use less plastic bags while showing them alternative forms of energy.</p>

We will take action at the University of Florida and Gainesville area, then in the surrounding Alachua county area and beyond, to reinvest in clean energy and socially responsible alternatives to fossil fuels.  Both the University of Florida and the City of Gainesville’s energy contract will be up for renewal soon.  One of our immediate goals will be to start a campaign that will allow for more forms of alternative to be included in the new contracts. Your donations will help empower us so we make our plans a reality, and help build a future we can all be proud of.




What We Need 

Our goal is to get 50 students from the University of Florida and the surrounding Gainesville area to Pittsburgh to attend Power Shift 2013, but we need YOUR help! 
To accommodate this large group we will need to rent a bus for transportation and book a hotel for lodging.  With this campaign we are specifically trying to raise money to cover our lodging, which we have estimated to be about 5000 dollars.  We plan to book 10 rooms with 5 people per room for Saturday and Sunday night.
We are working on other ways to raise money to cover transportation costs.  One of our fundraising techniques will involve our bike-powered sewing machine that we use to turn old t-shirts into handy, reusable tote bags!  We plan to set up at the Union Street Farmers Market Downtown on Wednesday afternoons and at the Alachua County Farmers Market on Saturday mornings on to give people the opportunity to use the bike-powered sewing machine and make their own reusable tote bags that can be used while they shop.  While we will be collecting donations, this will also be an educational and outreach event to get people to use less plastic bags while showing them alternative forms of energy.

""You do, we all do"" everyone in our very small place we call Mother Earth but do we care for her as we would do for our Mother? An idiom I coin is the cart before the horse, build build build, devour devour devour, consume consume consume, oh yeah the horse isn't even attached to the cart & we're not even in the race, why? Because our Eco Environmentally Sustainable Revolution hasn't even begun but it can begin right here right now!!! Surely it seems illogical & totally irrational but more to the point irresponsible to treat our energy needs as a donkey let alone a thoroughbred race horse that needs to be put at the front of the cart & not behind the cart, especially now that we have a hill to climb. A lovely quote I've made my own adaptation of is ""It's not what life brings to you but what you bring to life, said the farmer to the banker""  Help Bring Something hugely Meaningful & Potentially Significant To Life!!!

asparagus, celery, squash and cucumbers, citrus fruit, peaches, kiwi, cherries,
blueberries, cranberries, strawberries, cantaloupe, melons, as well as animal-feed
crops, such as the clover that’s fed to dairy cows. Essentially all flowering
plants need bees to survive.</p>

pollination by insects is estimated to be worth $19 billion to the economy of

Pigs out number people in North Carolina and their waste has become a huge environmental problem. The waste poses a threat to rivers, wildlife, and people. Together we begin to tackle this growing problem. 
Using
hog manure as an input for composting, we use red wiggler worms to consume the
manure and produce worm castings that act as one of the world’s most potent
organic fertilizers. This composting process provides a premium product while
diminishing a major pollutant in North Carolina. Synthetic fertilizers are
known to be an environmental detriment due to the chemical run off harming our
water supply. Our product is an alternative fertilizer that mitigates the
environmental hazards of synthetic fertilizers, while improving healthy soil
ecology.

Similarly, iron  was  detected  at  34  mg/l,  some  113  times  the State  MCL Safe  Drinking  Water standard. At the time, Mr. Rubin stated, ""While  all  analyses  have  not  been  completed,  preliminary findings also indicate the presence of low level hexanes, octanes, and decanes.""He added ""However, the high pH of the water indicates the presence of SIGNIFICANT other frack - related chemicals that are both unknown  and  untested – chemical  compounds  that  do  not  have  MCLs – chemicals  that  potentially present long-term chronic exposure to toxins and carcinogens.""Rubin found that the pH of the water has repeatedly been found to be around 9.5 – a very basic water, some 10 times  the  normal  outer  MCL State  drinking  water  standard range of  pH  8.5  and,  quite likely,  100  times that  of a  more  normal Dimock groundwater  pH.    ""This  is  highly  unusual  and extremely troubling.  Something is VERY wrong with this water,"" he wrote in testimony offered at a press conference.Holding up a sample of Scott's water, Mr. Rubin said, ""Here, you can see it as it now comes  out  of  the  well – the color of  chocolate  milk, five  times  the  maximum  allowable PA MCL Safe  Drinking Water standard (75  vs.  15  color  units) for  color.    Even  after  weeks,  it still does not settle out""   What We Need & What You Get We need to raise $1,500 to pay for Paul Rubin's time and analysis. He will need to be deposed by the Cabot attorneys, prepare for cross-examination, and has been gracious with his professional time thus far, offering Dimock families his services at reduced rates. 
For all donors, we will mention you in a video to thank you for your support.
You will be the first to know the progress on Scott's landmark case.
You or your group will be welcome in Dimock for a private tour of fracking, related infrastructure, and to meet families with water contamination.

  The Impact If Scott's case is successful, we will finally have some closure on the Dimock case and compensation, in the best case scenario, would include a permanent water supply for at least the Ely family. At the very least, the discovery phase will serve as an opportunity to compel evidence like internal communications from Cabot that will reveal the standard operating procedures when families cry foul.Anyone interested in public health, environmental justice, and corporate accountability, should find our fundraiser a worthy cause.
