<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p>We’ve worked hard over the last few months to get the Amp.i.Am to this point and we've successfully completed critical milestones with the help of many knowledgeable people. We have interviewed, visited and selected a very reputable manufacturer who offers great engineering support and development tools. What remains is completing the manufacturing phase and so we're confident that manufacturing risk is at a minimum.</p>
<p>We anticipate a manufacturing period of 2 months from the end of the campaign to start shipping Amp.i.Am to you. This is possible because we’ve already completed our R&amp;D, obtained our Apple MFi certification and the rest we can complete with your help and have Amp.i.Am shipped to you 10 weeks after the end of this campaign and in time for the holidays and with you no later than December 15.</p>
<p>While we have taken every effort to test the compatibility of Amp.i.Am with many headphones, we cannot guarantee compatibility with every headphone set out in the universe. There are simply too many to test with and we are sure there will be several headphones that Amp.i.Am cannot fully support including but not limited to performance, controls or amplification. We guarantee compatibility and performance with Apple supplied wired headphones with the 3.5mm audio jack.</p>

<p><b style=""font-size: 24px;letter-spacing: 0px;"">FAQ</b></p>
<p><b>Does Amp.i.Am improve sound quality with a mediocre pair of headphones?</b><br/>To deliver detailed and delicate sound to headphones requires many things. An amplifier is one of them. The purpose of AMP.I.AM  is to enhance the sound source by using hi-fi codec to make a difference in your overall listening experience. </p>
<p><b>Does AMP.I.AM  support Windows or Android Phones?</b><br/>No. Amp.i.Am is strictly for i-devices such as the iPhone, iPad or iPod touch with a Lightning connector.</p>
<p><b>So this AMP.I.AM  thing can't be plugged into the headphone jack? </b><br/>That's right. AMP.I.AM  can only be connected to Lightning</p>
<p><b>Does AMP.I.AM  consume a lot of power then?</b><br/>Take iPhone 6 as an example, an hour of music playing consumes 5% power. </p>
<p><b>Can I use a Lightning to 30-pin adapter to make it fit on iPhone 4S? </b><br/>Sorry. The Audio Lightning Adapter does not support an adapter</p>
<p><b>Will you consider making a Bluetooth version?</b><br/>We'd not consider a Bluetooth version before finding an effective solution to improve the sound quality of compressed files</p>
<p><b>Is Amp.i.Am compatible with all headphones?</b><br/>No. While we have taken every effort to test the compatibility of Amp.i.Am with many headphones, we cannot guarantee compatibility with every headphone set out in the universe. There are simply too many to test with and we are sure there will be several headphones that Amp.i.Am cannot fully support including but not limited to performance, controls or amplification. We guarantee compatibility and performance with Apple supplied wired headphones with the 3.5mm audio jack.</p>
<p><b>It is just for headphones or could I use it with loudspeakers too?</b><br/>Amp.i.Am  can also connect to active speakers</p>
<p><b>Will there be a type-C version?</b><br/>We don't have plans to develop type-c models for now</p>
<p><b>Can I still receive phone calls with my ear buds mic? </b><br/>You can still receive calls and the inline mic of your earbuds would function correctly</p>
<p><b>Besides iPhones, does it work with iPads, iPod Touch, and iPod nano?</b>AMP.I.AM  works with iOS devices that support USB audio. So only iPhones, iPads, and iPod touch with Lightning. Not compatible with iPod nano</p>
<p><b>How do I give you my address / choice of color / combination? </b><br/>We'll send you a survey to confirm your choice of color/ combination and address after the project's successfully funded.</p>

Risks and challenges
We’ve worked hard over the last few months to get the Amp.i.Am to this point and we've successfully completed critical milestones with the help of many knowledgeable people. We have interviewed, visited and selected a very reputable manufacturer who offers great engineering support and development tools. What remains is completing the manufacturing phase and so we're confident that manufacturing risk is at a minimum.
We anticipate a manufacturing period of 2 months from the end of the campaign to start shipping Amp.i.Am to you. This is possible because we’ve already completed our R&D, obtained our Apple MFi certification and the rest we can complete with your help and have Amp.i.Am shipped to you 10 weeks after the end of this campaign and in time for the holidays and with you no later than December 15.
While we have taken every effort to test the compatibility of Amp.i.Am with many headphones, we cannot guarantee compatibility with every headphone set out in the universe. There are simply too many to test with and we are sure there will be several headphones that Amp.i.Am cannot fully support including but not limited to performance, controls or amplification. We guarantee compatibility and performance with Apple supplied wired headphones with the 3.5mm audio jack.

 
FAQ
Does Amp.i.Am improve sound quality with a mediocre pair of headphones?To deliver detailed and delicate sound to headphones requires many things. An amplifier is one of them. The purpose of AMP.I.AM  is to enhance the sound source by using hi-fi codec to make a difference in your overall listening experience. 
Does AMP.I.AM  support Windows or Android Phones?No. Amp.i.Am is strictly for i-devices such as the iPhone, iPad or iPod touch with a Lightning connector.
So this AMP.I.AM  thing can't be plugged into the headphone jack? That's right. AMP.I.AM  can only be connected to Lightning
Does AMP.I.AM  consume a lot of power then?Take iPhone 6 as an example, an hour of music playing consumes 5% power. 
Can I use a Lightning to 30-pin adapter to make it fit on iPhone 4S? Sorry. The Audio Lightning Adapter does not support an adapter
Will you consider making a Bluetooth version?We'd not consider a Bluetooth version before finding an effective solution to improve the sound quality of compressed files
Is Amp.i.Am compatible with all headphones?No. While we have taken every effort to test the compatibility of Amp.i.Am with many headphones, we cannot guarantee compatibility with every headphone set out in the universe. There are simply too many to test with and we are sure there will be several headphones that Amp.i.Am cannot fully support including but not limited to performance, controls or amplification. We guarantee compatibility and performance with Apple supplied wired headphones with the 3.5mm audio jack.
It is just for headphones or could I use it with loudspeakers too?Amp.i.Am  can also connect to active speakers
Will there be a type-C version?We don't have plans to develop type-c models for now
Can I still receive phone calls with my ear buds mic? You can still receive calls and the inline mic of your earbuds would function correctly
Besides iPhones, does it work with iPads, iPod Touch, and iPod nano?AMP.I.AM  works with iOS devices that support USB audio. So only iPhones, iPads, and iPod touch with Lightning. Not compatible with iPod nano
How do I give you my address / choice of color / combination? We'll send you a survey to confirm your choice of color/ combination and address after the project's successfully funded.

<p><b>BENEFITS CORPORATION:</b> Sonic Blocks is a Benefits
Corporation. We chose this business organization option because we strongly
believe that out company has an obligation to society at large in addition to
our investors. We ""pay it forward"" by donating a percentage of our
profits to organization and non-profits dedicated to supporting the health and
welfare of children. CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates) is among the
first groups that we support.</p>
<p><b>CERTIFIED STARTUP NEW YORK COMPANY:</b> Sonic Blocks was one of
only 41 emerging companies awarded Startup NY Certification by New York
Governor Cuomo in July of 2014. Based at Binghamton University, the company
receives numerous benefits from this special certification including: 10 years
of tax free operations and company employees can earn up to $300,000 without
paying state and local taxes (based on filing status).</p>
<p><b>NEXT-GEN ENTREPRENEUR OUTREACH:</b> As a Startup NY
organization, Sonic Blocks was granted unprecedented access to the resources of
Binghamton University, as well as the Science &amp; Technology Law Center at
Syracuse University. The company engaged with the Office of Entrepreneurship
&amp; Innovation Partnerships, staff, faculty, labs, law students, and over a
dozen student entrepreneurs in multiple fields of study.</p>
<p><b>WOMEN IN TECHNOLOGY:</b> Sonic Blocks supports the fight for
gender equality. All women deserve equal pay for equal work, equal treatment,
equal influence over the company's development, and the opportunity for
advancement, ultimately leading to greater financial independence. Let us know
your skill sets. We are hiring engineers (EE-ME-SW), industrial designers,
social media experts, and more.</p>
<p><b>MADE IN AMERICA:</b> We are committed to manufacturing Sonic
Blocks in the US. We feel strongly about putting people back to work in this country
in the manufacturing sector. The challenge is finding at least 50% of our parts
that are made domestically and we must incur 75% of our total costs in the USA
in order to achieve this designation. If not, we will strive for Made in USA of
foreign parts, or Assembled in the USA. Let us know if you can help.</p>
<p><b>CASA:</b> Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) are
extensively trained volunteers, assigned by a Family Court Judge, that advocate
for the best interests of children who have been removed from their homes due
to abuse and/or neglect through no fault of their own. CASA's navigate within a
severely overburdened and broken system ensuring every assigned child receives
the services they so desperately need.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Why Are We Crowdfunding?</h2>
<p>JD and I quickly realized that our product was intended for
those of you that think for yourselves, desire greater control over your own music environment, and don’t want others dictating to you what or how you should consume your entertainment. Sonic Blocks is
very much a ""Want"" product, but your patronage allows us to do so
much more, and helps supports our charities related to the health and welfare
of kids, and that is a real ""Need"". So instead of allowing the investment
community to control the introduction of the product, we took on the
risk of financing 100% of the startup costs ourselves, and put it all on the
line. Now we are ready to introduce you to Sonic Blocks, and hope that you will
help us take the product to the next level. We fully expect that you will tell
us the good, bad, and ugly of what we are offering, and what we should do to
make it better for you. You will help guide our development, and in turn, we
will dedicate our teams to bringing you products and accessories that you
""Want"", in the hopes that you will be using our products for
generations to come, and we can help some kids that are in serious need. We
hope you agree.</p>

<p></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks</h2>
<p>Having
worked in the consumer electronics and product development field
conceptualizing and producing new products from scratch for the past twenty
years, we have a high degree of confidence in our ability to deliver this
product.</p>
<p>As inventors,
we have to focus on the details, and putting together a talented team
representing all of the engineering disciplines that go into our Sonic
Blocks.<span>  Even though we are utilizing and
incorporating many existing technologies, we are doing so in ways never before
done in the consumer electronics industry. 
This alone brings an element of risk to our project, as consolidation
and implementation of anything new requires vigilante testing and careful
modifications.  Given that we have many
interdependent elements in our system, a change in any one area can potentially
impact other areas.  We strive to balance
modifications, against functionality, and the best user experience.  Risk examples include changes or
modifications to our printed circuit board production (PCB), any delays from
our module supplier, battery producers, injection molding companies,
speaker driver production companies, and the impact of any of these elements on
the mobile application development.  Turn
times run differently with each of these parts. 
However, we aim to mitigate any potential delays via domestic
manufacturing and assembly.</span></p>
<p><span><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><br/></span></p>
<p></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Thank You For Your Support!</h2>
<p>It gives us great joy to be able to share Sonic Blocks with you, and we are really excited to receive your feedback and suggestions.<span> 
We designed the product for you, and to allow you to control your sound like never before. Let us know
what accessories you would like us to develop for your Sonic Blocks next.  We are already starting to work on lighting,
cameras, and projector concepts that you can plug into your blocks. Once the first campaign is successful, and the initial products are in your hands, we will be
assembling a great development team to keep up with demand and the great ideas
for new products that we expect to come from you in the User community.</span></p>Also, if you have talents that you think would be of help to Sonic Blocks, be
it electrical or mechanical engineering, prototyping, social and digital media,
graphic design, programming, mobile applications, eCommerce, distribution,
international sales, etc. drop us a line.<span> 
We are looking for great people to join the Sonic Blocks team.</span>  Thanks for your contribution.</div><div>© 2016 Sonic Blocks, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

WOMEN IN TECHNOLOGY: Sonic Blocks supports the fight for
gender equality. All women deserve equal pay for equal work, equal treatment,
equal influence over the company's development, and the opportunity for
advancement, ultimately leading to greater financial independence. Let us know
your skill sets. We are hiring engineers (EE-ME-SW), industrial designers,
social media experts, and more.
MADE IN AMERICA: We are committed to manufacturing Sonic
Blocks in the US. We feel strongly about putting people back to work in this country
in the manufacturing sector. The challenge is finding at least 50% of our parts
that are made domestically and we must incur 75% of our total costs in the USA
in order to achieve this designation. If not, we will strive for Made in USA of
foreign parts, or Assembled in the USA. Let us know if you can help.
CASA: Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) are
extensively trained volunteers, assigned by a Family Court Judge, that advocate
for the best interests of children who have been removed from their homes due
to abuse and/or neglect through no fault of their own. CASA's navigate within a
severely overburdened and broken system ensuring every assigned child receives
the services they so desperately need.





 In advance of the campaign, we have engaged with numerous best in class manufacturing operations, with our desire to keep all production within the USA for greater hands-on quality control and just-in-time modifications. Additionally, we are working with one of the world’s largest component part supplier, and they are assisting with contract manufacturing operations.  One of the larger US based surface mount technology equipment suppliers has also offered their services in support of our operations, should we wish to stand-up our own manufacturing.  We are prepared to drive scalable volume regardless of the success of our campaign.



FAQs



Q:     Can I buy just one Sonic Blocks Starter Kit or do I need to buy the entire system?

Why Are We Crowdfunding?
JD and I quickly realized that our product was intended for
those of you that think for yourselves, desire greater control over your own music environment, and don’t want others dictating to you what or how you should consume your entertainment. Sonic Blocks is
very much a ""Want"" product, but your patronage allows us to do so
much more, and helps supports our charities related to the health and welfare
of kids, and that is a real ""Need"". So instead of allowing the investment
community to control the introduction of the product, we took on the
risk of financing 100% of the startup costs ourselves, and put it all on the
line. Now we are ready to introduce you to Sonic Blocks, and hope that you will
help us take the product to the next level. We fully expect that you will tell
us the good, bad, and ugly of what we are offering, and what we should do to
make it better for you. You will help guide our development, and in turn, we
will dedicate our teams to bringing you products and accessories that you
""Want"", in the hopes that you will be using our products for
generations to come, and we can help some kids that are in serious need. We
hope you agree.



Risks
Having
worked in the consumer electronics and product development field
conceptualizing and producing new products from scratch for the past twenty
years, we have a high degree of confidence in our ability to deliver this
product.
As inventors,
we have to focus on the details, and putting together a talented team
representing all of the engineering disciplines that go into our Sonic
Blocks.  Even though we are utilizing and
incorporating many existing technologies, we are doing so in ways never before
done in the consumer electronics industry. 
This alone brings an element of risk to our project, as consolidation
and implementation of anything new requires vigilante testing and careful
modifications.  Given that we have many
interdependent elements in our system, a change in any one area can potentially
impact other areas.  We strive to balance
modifications, against functionality, and the best user experience.  Risk examples include changes or
modifications to our printed circuit board production (PCB), any delays from
our module supplier, battery producers, injection molding companies,
speaker driver production companies, and the impact of any of these elements on
the mobile application development.  Turn
times run differently with each of these parts. 
However, we aim to mitigate any potential delays via domestic
manufacturing and assembly.


Thank You For Your Support!
It gives us great joy to be able to share Sonic Blocks with you, and we are really excited to receive your feedback and suggestions. 
We designed the product for you, and to allow you to control your sound like never before. Let us know
what accessories you would like us to develop for your Sonic Blocks next.  We are already starting to work on lighting,
cameras, and projector concepts that you can plug into your blocks. Once the first campaign is successful, and the initial products are in your hands, we will be
assembling a great development team to keep up with demand and the great ideas
for new products that we expect to come from you in the User community.Also, if you have talents that you think would be of help to Sonic Blocks, be
it electrical or mechanical engineering, prototyping, social and digital media,
graphic design, programming, mobile applications, eCommerce, distribution,
international sales, etc. drop us a line. 
We are looking for great people to join the Sonic Blocks team.  Thanks for your contribution.© 2016 Sonic Blocks, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

<p>We are encouraged by the trend of music lovers who want to get back to substance with their music collection. They are eager to (re)discover the joy of sliding an LP out of it's jacket (the feeling and scent of nostalgia), placing it on the turntable, cleaning the surface, not just pushing a button but carefully and lowering the stylus onto the record to start the chain reaction. Sending the music to the speakers and out into the room, reaching their ears and following the flow of the players emotion into their heart and soul: the joy, the love, the peace, but also the raw aggression, the anger and the angst, the frustration… the darkness and  the light. They long to feel what the artists were feeling, when they put pen to paper and then instrument to air, and then electricity to vinyl and tape and digits. </p>

    & 



Our main effort here on Indiegogo is to bring Elipson's amazing new Turntables & their Lifestyle Music Systems to the US market. 



The vehicle for that is our new eCommerce store, www.evoqmusic.com
(click the link to check it out) & our brick & mortar showroom 
on the southside of Old Town Scottsdale, Arizona
just north of the Tempe, Arizona State University area.
The good news is that music lovers are becoming increasingly aware, informed and connected. You don’t want cheap any more. You want quality.  You are searching and you must find it somewhere. 
We have it and I believe that you’ll beat a path to our door. Value and performance combined with knowledgeable advice. We are hard to beat!
There are only just a few affordable high-performance turntables available in the US today and most are very basic and seriously complicated to set-up and live with.
We feel passionately that we need to change this, to bring value, to bring performance, to bring back the old school ways, but updated to the latest highest state of technology. 
This is the vision that Elipson calls ""Invisible Technology"". 
The main ""benefit"" of the all-in-one record players at Urban Outfitters is that they are easy to deal with. You just plug them in and spin a record, easy.
The opportunity that the Elipson wireless turntables offer is that same level of easy, combined with audiophile level performance. Add the real benefit of being able to stream Vinyl to the same Bluetooth Speakers and Systems that we stream our digital  music too blows minds. Such a big step forward.

We are encouraged by the trend of music lovers who want to get back to substance with their music collection. They are eager to (re)discover the joy of sliding an LP out of it's jacket (the feeling and scent of nostalgia), placing it on the turntable, cleaning the surface, not just pushing a button but carefully and lowering the stylus onto the record to start the chain reaction. Sending the music to the speakers and out into the room, reaching their ears and following the flow of the players emotion into their heart and soul: the joy, the love, the peace, but also the raw aggression, the anger and the angst, the frustration… the darkness and  the light. They long to feel what the artists were feeling, when they put pen to paper and then instrument to air, and then electricity to vinyl and tape and digits. 
Elipson is a well established 70 year old French company, just not as well known here in the States. It's very easy to imagine it as the French incarnation of B&W or KEF but with a lot more style and it's own long, storied and noteworthy history.
They are selling two new series of turntables, the Alpha & Omega in Europe. We need your teamwork to share them with our North American friends.



Both series have a basic table, a table with a RIAA phono stage built in and a deluxe version with USB & an aptX® bluetooth transmitter onboard. All come with an Ortofon phone cartridge pre-installed. Very cool!



Along with the basic perks, we will also make some special purchases to say thank you as Premium Perks







8"" 10"" & 12"" Subwoofers

Elipson Timber Bluetooth Speaker

Edwards Audio Apprentice LITE




Elipson Lenny Bluetooth Speaker


Blue Aura v30 Blackline Music System






We Need You & your Teamwork!

We just need this little boost to kick things into high gear and we'd love to offer you an opportunity to save some significant money as a thank you!

We need to outfit our new Scottsdale showroom in a basic way, set up a few demonstration systems and fund our lease & baseline overhead costs related to that until we get this off the ground.

We need to kick off our Programmatic Web-based Marketing System – Targeted Banners/SEO/PPC/Email Updates, etc.
We need to follow up throughout the year with a few special events and shows with them and our selected music associate Vinyl Me, Please is an important part of our promotional plans. Check them out here: www.vinylmeplease.com



We do have several of the necessary major parts of the project in place. The website is written and live, the online store is fully operational, we have worked out brand availability with our suppliers, we have selected our retail space, we have a receiving warehouse and shipping services in place. We are in motion and will do what ever is required to help spread the enjoyment of music to as many people as we are able. 

Your teamwork is very much appreciated. We would really like to keep in contact with you as we move past this founding stage in our history. As we go forward together, we will make other special buys available to you in the Indiegogo INDEMAND space, share our group's knowledge and experience on the blog, host live events & drop parties and things that we haven't even thought of yet. We look forward to meeting you and learning more about what you want and need from us, extending the good will and creating a tight knit community is our goal.

The Benefit to You 

contribute and get in on the special Premium Perks,


or just get some pretty cool swag and know that you have made it a lot easier for music lovers everywhere to share the enjoyment of music on a proper HiFi system & GET THEM OUT FROM BEHIND THE EARBUDS!



Risks & Challenges
 We believe that the risks and challenges here are minimal.
Everything related to our perks is already in our online store, is brand new and current model.
Physical Perks will ship ASAP.
Our assortment will only get more diverse, if you want something that we don't offer, tell us about it and we will see if we can get it added to the INDEMAND slate.
We are seasoned Consumer Electronics Pros, we can do this and you can rely on me to take care of you all along the way. 
The risk of failure is also reduced by the fact that this is not our main source of income. We have been operating a successful Home Theater & Home Systems Custom Installation business in the Phoenix area for more than 15 years. 


Other Ways You Can Help 
If you feel good about what we are building here, but just can't part with any hard earned money right now, you can still get on the team. It would be great if you would help us get the word out and make some noise about our campaign, we would sincerely appreciate it.

The easiest way to have some real fun is to get referral rewards by sharing our campaign using the share buttons to the left of the video at the top of the page. As long as you're logged in to Indiegogo, each time you share using those buttons, Indiegogo tracks contributions that come in from those shares. Simple!

When you refer 10 Contributors the premium perks, you get a Free Perk of the same level as your baseline referral!

Good Luck, we only have a month left!
We aren't lawyers or accountants, so all applicable taxes are your responsibility, please consult your accountant for their advice & your local taxing authority for their requirements.
As with everything purchased in the store, local delivery & basic set-up is always free. Local backers, please deduct any shipping charges from your contribution amount & I'll bring along a small extra gift too, see you soon!

<p>Headphones are much more than a pair of speakers on your head. 
They’re an expression of your style.  Jealous Angel’s Heartpulse headphones command attention by merging function and fashion by combining the latest LED and battery technology, an oversized 50mm driver, a proprietary pulsing circuit and house it in a shape we can all relate too.  <strong>DJ’s will stand apart from the rest with a heart shaped pulsing light, pumping to the tempo of the music</strong>.  Jogger's will be seen crossing the street <strong>at night, adding visibility for oncoming traffic</strong>.  A switch gives you the choice to turn them off, pulse to the music you’re listening too or stay on.</p>
<p><b>Ergonomics</b>- The human ear is half the shape of a heart. One side of the heart 
wraps perfectly around the ear to isolate the outside noise while 
providing perfect natural acoustics to your ear’s shape. The other side 
allows space for internal ports to add more volume and bottom-end. The 
combination gives unsurpassable clarity and detail.<br/></p>
<b>The TEAM<br/>Designed by Paul Rivera Jr of Rivera Amplification.  </b>Rivera amps are 
known for  creating high quality products with desirable tones and is extensively used by 
legendary Grammy award winning producers, engineers and top musicians 
from around the 
world.  Paul brings this same ""<b>Build the best"" philosophy to the Jealous Angel brand</b>.<b><br/><br/></b><p>We also teamed up with one of the best manufacturers of high-end 
headphones and suppliers of well known brands to make sure we deliver 
something special.  Besides the patent pending LED pulsing features, the internal <strong>bigger 50MM drivers (most headphones use 35 or 40mm) will give maximum bass even the ultra low 10Hz frequencies</strong>. Perfect for DJ’s to match that beat, especially in the world of Hip Hop and EDM.<br/></p>

<p>I am a drummer and an artisan. While observing amplifiers, speakers, and audio systems I noticed that they are mostly cubic in shape: if they are built like that, how would a similarly shaped bass drum sound compared to a classic cylindrical one?  It was by asking myself this question that everything was born.</p>

THE PRODUCTS

The same intuition used for the bass drum was applied to the remaining components of the set, thus creating the Quadratura System.
Briefly, this system consists of two perforated and pantographed rings, allowing to insert four curved wood panels, which together create four 90-degree angles.


That’s where the ""Quadratura"" name comes from: it means ”squaring"" in Italian.
The unique and recognizable sound is the key-feature of all our products: its precise attack, its elevated (but controlled) sustain, its selective exaltation of harmonics, coupled with an incredible sensitivity and precision in tuning, all give musicians infinite timbral possibilities.



 

 

 

The choice of variable thickness of woods is the result of a meticulous research and years of experimentation. Together with the final craftsmanship assembly, all these elements give a soul to products that show unparalleled robustness and reliability when used “on the road”.
The high quality of the product, not only in woods but also in many custom-made mechanical details, makes this set unique.

Its sophisticated design originates from a 100% Italian production that could be appreciated even from a pure aesthetic point of view.

That’s why I would like to hear it in a large concert hall as well as to see it displayed in a design exhibition.

Other earbuds have tried, but none have gotten even close to the amount of color options we offer. With a three-color gradient and the entire color spectrum at your beck and call, there are over 5 million color combinations for you to pick, any time you want!

The Beam's light rings can also pulse to the beat of your music or match color to your album artwork. Our advanced pulsing algorithm was developed in-house and will drive bass-heads wild with the changing light rhythm.

With our app, your earbuds can tap into the entire color spectrum. Our customizable light ring changes on the fly to any color you want!

The customizable light rings shine so bright, they also serve practical uses in your everyday life. Highly visible at nighttime, turn on the light ring when it's dark to alert people of your presence.

By pulling up the Clutch™ Knob it separates from the Clutch™ Nut's rotating shim.The Clutch™ Nut comprise two parts : a lower fixed nut and a rotating shim:The rotating shim is connected to the lower fixed nut with a spring,so when it is turned and released, it jumps back to its starting position,just like a rotary dial phone: Released means when the Clutch™ Knob separatesfrom the Clutch™ Nut's rotating shim, so this ""jump-back""does not effect on the Clutch™ Knob.The Clutch™Knob turns only when you turn it.The ""jump-back"" effect is to reset the rotating-shim, so when engagment created it is always starts turningfrom the physical stop point. You can find more information about the operation of the devicein our website http://guitarclutch.comThe device components were designed, to be able to be built insideany kind of pot-knob, so it wont change the appearance of your guitar. DesignsWe are able to build in the Clutch™ mechanism in almost all kind ofthe guitar knobs, right now we have the following designs:GBSN, TELE, JB, STRT-W, STRT-BL If you would like to choose different colour or different knob design,pls leave a comment or contact us info(at)guitarclutch.com,we are capable of producing more variations.It’s easy to install!You don’t have to change the potentiometer, just replace the potknob and the nutwith the Clutch™ Knob and the Clutch™ Nut!Remove the knob and the nut                            Install the  Clutch™ NutInstall the Clutch™ Knob                                     Ready to use!Many of our friends and fellow guitarplayers have been using their Clutch™,with great success and satisfaction:   We have all  the materials and technologies ready and we are ableto produce Clutch™ samples by CNC in our workshop,approximately 400-500 units per month. Our goal is to optimize the product for mass production.  But at the moment very few people heard about this revolutionary guitar accessory,and we need to break trough the wall of obscurity.And thats where you come in the pictureIf you can choose from the pot knob which can only turn the potentiometer, or the one that can remember your sweet spots, you surely will pick the one with the extra feature.If you have heard about it.To make it happen, we need  the publicity that the succesfull IGG campaigncan provide to boost the project and spread the word among fellow guitaristsaround the world. Our goal is to step up to a higher level of mass production,witch tooling costs more than we can afford right now. Your support will make this possible. When you select a level of contribution from the right, and support our project,in return you will receive the CNC manufactured, hand made precision device,we are currently producing.The kit contains:• 1 Clutch™ Knob ( you can choose GBSN, TELE, JB, STRT-W, STRT-BL style)• 1 Clutch™ Nut,  • 1 Allen key (M3 size),  • 1 special Clutch™ wrench, • 2 adapters for split shafts or metric type solid shaftsMake sure you know the type of your pot: Is it metric or inch standard?Inch standard pot’s threaded collar is 3/8 inch (9.5 mm approx.) Metric standard pot’s is 8 mm (5/16 inch approx.)

<b>How to use the Pocket Party</b><p>Like most
Bluetooth speakers, the Pocket Party is very easy to use. When switched-on the
first time, you can pair your smart phone with it by choosing ‘Pocket Party’ on
the list of available devices.</p>
<p><b>How does light
show work?</b></p>
<p>Pocket Party
features a colorful light show that intelligently synchronizes with the music
being played, and offers user programmability and four preset modes:
“beats"", “party”, “mood light” and “lamp”.</p>
<p>1) In beats
mode, four sets of LED form many dynamic patterns like equalizer, fountain,
striking, and firework etc. The patterns automatically match the music in an
intelligent way.</p>
<p>2) In party
mode, strobe lights kick in to create a dance club atmosphere.</p>
<p>3) In mood
light mode, it breathes slowly and still syncs with the music.</p>
<p>4) It can be set
as a lamp or even a torch, for table side, camping, or even selfie.</p>
<p><b>How can I choose
the different light show modes?</b></p>
<p>Pressing the
dedicated light show button briefly will cycle through all 4 modes: Beats,
Party, Mood Light, Lamp, and OFF.</p>
<p><b>Can I control
the light show from my smart phone?</b></p>
<p>Yes. The lights
in the Pocket Party can be controlled by the web-based app. You can directly
choose the setting of each mode. </p>
<p><b>How does
vibration mode work?</b></p>
<p>Vibrations of
low frequency signal (bass) are passed from the suction cup to any surface it
sticks to. A hollow surface such as a card board box will amplify the sound
better than a hard surface. A larger and thinner box can produce deeper bass,
just like a subwoofer. You can try it on different places. Here are some
suggestions: Pizza box, copy paper box, glass window, wooden cabinet, hard
suitcase, and refrigerator.</p>
<p>When the speaker
is half-way expanded, the vibration mode works better than when fully expanded.</p>
<p><b>Can I use the
Pocket Party as a speaker phone?</b></p>
<p>Yes. When a
phone call comes in, the Pocket Party will ring. You can press the Bluetooth
button to answer the call. Double-clicking the Bluetooth button will redial the
last number.</p>
<p><b>What is the
battery life?</b></p>
<p>The average play
time is 6 hour. It takes 2 hours to be fully charged.  </p>
<p><b>What is IPX4
splash-proof?</b></p>
<p>You can take it
to the shower, but you should not submerge it into water.</p>
<p><b>How about
drop-proof?</b></p>
<p>The Pocket Party
can withstand dropping of up to 6-feet.</p>
<p><b>How much is
shipping?</b></p>
<p>Shipping will be
$10 for anywhere in the USA, and $20 for the rest of the world.</p>

</div></div>","Introducing Pocket Party, the world's best pocket-sized expandable Bluetooth speaker which combines incredibly powerful and bass-enhanced sound with a music-synced light show. 






The Pocket Party is like the Swiss knife of speakers: Versatile, small and expandable with great sound, powerful stunning bass in vibration mode, really cool light show, camping lamp, mood light, suction cup, splash-proof, drop-proof, carabiner with bike-mount strap, iPad stand, and App control too. This speaker has it all. No wonder this little speaker surprises everyone who has seen it.
And with it's unique vibration mode, you can turn any pizza box into a Subwoofer for bigger bass sound.














Small speakers normally lack bass. The X-Bass
technology used in the Pocket Party breaks the ‘sound barrier’ of pocket size
speakers using advanced acoustic, driver and electronic design. The resulting sound is really amazing.








The
built-in smart light show synchronizes with the music to turn a living room
into a dance club! It is beautiful, dazzling and just plain awesome.




















 



The Pocket Party is drop-proof, splash-proof
and very adaptable with its suction cup and carabiner.



















You can choose from 4 different colors depending on your style: Pink, blue, green and gray.








We are dedicated to our timeline and will keep you regularly updated on the status of our progress. We are also committed to transparency and keeping our Pocket Party fans and Indiegogo backers informed.
















Yes, we will make sure the first batch of over 1000 units are delivered before Christmas.
















Two Pocket Party speakers can be connected
to double the power of sound and light. This feature is only available to the 'Double the Fun and Sound' perk.







Nick Mazza is a designer and a DJ (left). Michael Zhang (right) is an engineer and a dancer. Encouraged by the great success of his last invention - Near Field Audio (NearFA) speaker (also known as 'induction speaker'), Michael created the expandable/vibration 2-in-1 structure that could greatly improve the bass for a mini speaker. Michael and Nick, together with the supporting teams in both California and China, have developed the Pocket Party speaker that music lovers can bring along anywhere they go for an enjoyable time. 









How to use the Pocket PartyLike most
Bluetooth speakers, the Pocket Party is very easy to use. When switched-on the
first time, you can pair your smart phone with it by choosing ‘Pocket Party’ on
the list of available devices.
How does light
show work?
Pocket Party
features a colorful light show that intelligently synchronizes with the music
being played, and offers user programmability and four preset modes:
“beats"", “party”, “mood light” and “lamp”.
1) In beats
mode, four sets of LED form many dynamic patterns like equalizer, fountain,
striking, and firework etc. The patterns automatically match the music in an
intelligent way.
2) In party
mode, strobe lights kick in to create a dance club atmosphere.
3) In mood
light mode, it breathes slowly and still syncs with the music.
4) It can be set
as a lamp or even a torch, for table side, camping, or even selfie.
How can I choose
the different light show modes?
Pressing the
dedicated light show button briefly will cycle through all 4 modes: Beats,
Party, Mood Light, Lamp, and OFF.
Can I control
the light show from my smart phone?
Yes. The lights
in the Pocket Party can be controlled by the web-based app. You can directly
choose the setting of each mode. 
How does
vibration mode work?
Vibrations of
low frequency signal (bass) are passed from the suction cup to any surface it
sticks to. A hollow surface such as a card board box will amplify the sound
better than a hard surface. A larger and thinner box can produce deeper bass,
just like a subwoofer. You can try it on different places. Here are some
suggestions: Pizza box, copy paper box, glass window, wooden cabinet, hard
suitcase, and refrigerator.
When the speaker
is half-way expanded, the vibration mode works better than when fully expanded.
Can I use the
Pocket Party as a speaker phone?
Yes. When a
phone call comes in, the Pocket Party will ring. You can press the Bluetooth
button to answer the call. Double-clicking the Bluetooth button will redial the
last number.
What is the
battery life?
The average play
time is 6 hour. It takes 2 hours to be fully charged.  
What is IPX4
splash-proof?
You can take it
to the shower, but you should not submerge it into water.
How about
drop-proof?
The Pocket Party
can withstand dropping of up to 6-feet.
How much is
shipping?
Shipping will be
$10 for anywhere in the USA, and $20 for the rest of the world.",29.0,3,"1 Campaign

Marketing
and Brand Awareness: 
We need to create the tooling to expose the product to the

could potentially emerge and delay our schedule as well. To tackle this risk,
we've selected partners that can work closely with us through the whole process.

<h3>Make the American Boxcar Chorus Great Again</h3>
<p>Great artists produce great albums. The Great American Boxcar Chorus produces Great American Boxcar Chorus albums. But to actually be great, you must do. The GABC last put out a studio project in 2011. It's time to do what we do best. Time to do. Time to be GREAT again.</p>
<ul>
<li>With the collection of songs we have assembled, coupled with John Evans- the King of the Underground- as our producer, we are well on our way to achieving just that.</li>
<li>Making a new Boxcar album with all of the stops pulled is important because these songs help to provide highly original GABC music for those who are without- which is everyone in the world.</li>
<li>A record is being made. What kind-of a record that gets made depends on the level of involvement from those who contribute. For this to be GREAT, we need a great pledge from all of our fans, friends, and family that are in a position to do so. We need YOU to be GREAT! </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>It is very simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need about $9,000 to cover everything we would like to do. That added to the thousands we have already saved will cover studio time with a producer and engineer, mixing and mastering, artwork, printing/pressing costs, etc. We are making an album whether we meet this goal or not, but if our goal is not met, we may have to record only a small handful of songs vs. a full-length album, and we may have to cut other corners that would limit the scope and sound of what we are trying to accomplish as a whole. </li>
<li>This isn't something for nothing! We have some very unique perks! Everyone who backs us gets a copy of the album, but only those who pledge at particular levels will get a house concert by the GABC &amp; John Evans, or handmade BOXCARt, etc. </li>
<li>If we do not reach our goal, the funds will still go toward helping us make the best album that money can buy with the money that we have to work with. It is gonna be good no matter what... but with your help, it will be GREAT!</li>
</ul>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><div>
<p>We understand that not everyone is in a position to contribute, but that doesn't mean that you can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help us get the word out and make some noise about this record! Our fundraising efforts will only last a few short weeks; spread the love!</li>
<li>Just hit share by using the Indiegogo share tools on the far right of the page!</li>

If we do not reach our goal, the funds will still go toward helping us make the best album that money can buy with the money that we have to work with. It is gonna be good no matter what... but with your help, it will be GREAT!

Other Ways You Can Help
We understand that not everyone is in a position to contribute, but that doesn't mean that you can't help:

Help us get the word out and make some noise about this record! Our fundraising efforts will only last a few short weeks; spread the love!
Just hit share by using the Indiegogo share tools on the far right of the page!

We appreciate your support and encouragement. This thing is gonna be a dandy!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

 OUR CUSTOMER SAY ABOUT US
Dylan""This is truly amazing, I love my friends' reaction when I hold it in my hands, it plays music at a very low volume then I just put it on the table and BOOM!You definitely did an awesome work on this product!""Dakridis""Just to say, my Mini Troll is awesome. The sound is superb and the design is simply brilliant.""Patrick""I'm using the Mini-Troll for a about a month now. It works perfectly for me. The sound depends as expected on the surface but delivers very nicely. Great work.""Junewon""I'm pleasantly surprised with what it can do. Tried it on multiple surfaces and you can definitely tell the difference with the size of the surface area. Very happy with it so far""Banks""Massively impressed. No connectivity issues & really good Bluetooth range. The Trolls themselves look terrific & I had great fun playing audio whilst carrying it around before placing it on different surfaces. Super cool! Can't wait to use these on holiday.""Matthew""I love that the sound of the song reflects what it is attached to!""Naveen""Must say I was surprised to see the sound output: bigger the surface, better sound. I was not expecting to get such output from such small device.""
 : POWER BEYOND SIZE 
   Thanks to their innovative Vibration Resonance Technology, Vibe-Tribe Vibration Speakers allow much higher sound compared with traditional speakers of equal size on the market and still maintain extremely portable dimensions. WHERE DOES  POWER COME FROM?
Vibe-Tribe's technology is able to multiply the effectiveness of the audio source leveraging on the VIBRATION RESONANCE principle.   Mini Troll's Vibration Core exposed - 3D animationThe revolution in this technology comes with its RESONANCE CORE, which converts electromagnetic pulses into vibrations and spreads the sound directly across any surface, transforming it into a powerful sound source.
TRADITIONAL SPEAKERS VS  
          1. Sound directivity 
Traditional speakers project the sound in one single direction. Instead, all Vibe-Tribe vibration speakers transfer the sound to the surface upon which they are placed and spread the soundwaves 360° throughout the surrounding area, creating a Surround Effect.2. Sound transmissionIn all traditional speakers the sound is propagated from a small membrane and this naturally limits the sound power. Instead, with Vibe-Tribe vibration speakers the sound is projected by the mass of the chosen surface, allowing much higher sound level.

<p> </p>
<h3>The Manager Module</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516606238/ilmiqz5k2xjclsvijoz9.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The Manager module provides the ability to copy <i>“Elements”</i> and/or Samples from a Source Set/Project to a Target Set/Project; including the ability to remap sample assignments on the fly.</p>
<p>The Manager Module includes a powerful copy engine that utilises one of two modes <i>per</i> Element; <i>""Template""</i> and <i>""Relative""</i></p>
<p><strong>Template:</strong> Use a <i>single</i> Element as a Source to copy to one or more Target Elements; e.g.</p>
<p>Copy from Source Bank 01/A to Target Bank 04/D <i>and</i> Target Bank 07/G <i>and</i> Target Bank 12/L</p>
<p><strong>Relative:</strong> Use <i>multiple</i> Elements as a Source to copy to their relative Target Elements; e.g.</p>
<p>Copy from Source Bank 01/A to Target Bank 01/A <i>and  </i>copy from Source Bank 04/D to Target Bank 04/D <i>and </i>copy from Source Bank 07/G to Target Bank 12/G</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each Element in a hierarchy<i>(e.g. when copying a Scene you specify the Bank, Part and Scene)</i> can use either Template or Relative mode; resulting in an extremely powerful, yet very easy to use engine.</p>
<p><strong>Elements that can be copied:</strong></p>
<ul></ul>
<ul>
<li>Banks</li>
<li>Patterns</li>
<li>Pattern and Associated Parts</li>
<li>Tracks</li>
<li>Parts</li>
<li>Scenes</li>
<li>Recorders</li>
<li>Arrangements</li>
</ul>
<p>The Manager module also includes the ability to remap sample assignments on the fly.</p>
<p>Simply put Source Sample Slots can be <i>""re-mapped""</i> to Target Sample Slots.</p>
<p>When Elements are copied; any references to the Source Sample Slot is mapped to the Target Sample Slot; for example:</p>
<p><strong>Copying:</strong> Source Bank 01/A to Target Bank 04/D and mapping Source Slot Flex 001 to Target Slot Flex 007</p>
<strong>Result:</strong> Any where that Source Slot Flex 001 is used in Source Bank 01/A; e.g. Machine Assignments, Sample Locks etc will be mapped to Target Slot Flex 007 seamlessly in Target Bank Flex 04/D<p> </p>
<p>Using the Manager module means that with just a couple of clicks entire sets can be merged together seamlessly, meaning you never have to worry about the Octatrack structure ever again.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Chainer Module</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516606262/wsmmgxxkwdgrbip2zlca.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Does OctaEdit work in real-time?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately not. This is a limitation of the Compact Flash format; only allowing one device to access the card at any point in time; either the Octatrack or your computer.</p>
<p><strong>This is a limitation of the Octatrack hardware.</strong></p>
<p>Additionally, the Octatrack has a very limited MIDI implementation; and no SysEx implementation.</p>
<p>Whilst I could develop a Midi version of OctaEdit; it would be limited to only the standard parameters <i>(i.e. not the Setup pages)</i> of the current Part of the current Bank in the Project.</p>
<p>Over midi I would not even be able to provide 10% of the functionality that exists in OctaEdit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Can I Sell / Transfer my OctaEdit licence?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Please contact me for more details prior to selling.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Is there / will there be a demo version??</strong></p>
<p>Not at present.</p>
<p>A demo version would either neuter OctaEdit to such a degree to defeat the purpose of a demo, and/or the development of a demo version would draw resources away from core development.</p>
<p>Post v2 launch, I will look at creating a demo version.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will you be adding in function X, Y or Z?</strong></p>
<p>Now would be a great time to let me know if you have any feature requests; or additional functionality that you would like added.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will OctaEdit work with my Computer / Soundcard combination?</strong></p>
<p>It should do. I've only ever had a single report from a user who told me they had issues.</p>
<p>To mitigate any risk; I will be publishing a simple audio playback application that will utilise the same code as OctaEdit's playback engine to ensure compatibility.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Do you work for/with Elektron? Are you affiliated with them in any way?</strong></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I am an independent software developer who has developed OctaEdit independently, with zero support or assistance from Elektron in any way, shape or form.</p>
<p>Neither OctaEdit, nor I, have any affiliation with Elektron Music Machines; nor is OctaEdit supported or endorsed by Elektron; nor is any intent made to seem otherwise.</p>
<p>Basically, I'm just another Octatrack user :)</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Because OctaEdit v1 is already fully functional; and used by a wide variety of users, across OSX, PC and multiple Octatrack OS versions, I don't expect any severe challenges at this point.</p>
<p>The OctaEdit v2 release is about a GUI update, adding OSv1.30 support and additional functionality onto an already well established and mature code base that has been heavily used in the real world by many users.</p>
<p>Any potential risk or challenge will relate to time limitations <i>(hence this campaign)</i> or unforseen bugs within the underlying OS that will require an update.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>What can I do to help?</strong></h3>
<p>Spread the word. Post links. Spam forums / social media. Tell everyone how awesome OctaEdit is. The quicker / better the IndieGoGo campaign gets funded; the quicker I get to work, the more I can concentrate on the update.</p>
<p>If enough funds are raised; I can quit the day job and work on the update full time; massively expediting how quickly it is release.</p>
<p>If even more funds are raised; I can work on some other projects, software and hardware afterwards.</p>

The Arranger Module

The Arranger module allows the ability to edit any of the eight Arrangements with an Octatrack Set.
Arranger Rows can be added, deleted and edited either individually or in bulk.
Using the Arranger Module you can edit the

Row Patterns, Actions and Comments (REM)
Row Offset / Lengths
Row Scene Assignments
Row Tempo
Row Midi Transpose
Row Audio and Midi Mutes

Arrangements can also be freely copied from a Source Arrangement to a Target Arrangement.
Ever had troubles working in the Arranger? OctaEdit will unleash the power of this underutilised side of the Octatrack for you.
 
The Manager Module

The Manager module provides the ability to copy “Elements” and/or Samples from a Source Set/Project to a Target Set/Project; including the ability to remap sample assignments on the fly.
The Manager Module includes a powerful copy engine that utilises one of two modes per Element; ""Template"" and ""Relative""
Template: Use a single Element as a Source to copy to one or more Target Elements; e.g.
Copy from Source Bank 01/A to Target Bank 04/D and Target Bank 07/G and Target Bank 12/L
Relative: Use multiple Elements as a Source to copy to their relative Target Elements; e.g.
Copy from Source Bank 01/A to Target Bank 01/A and  copy from Source Bank 04/D to Target Bank 04/D and copy from Source Bank 07/G to Target Bank 12/G
 
Each Element in a hierarchy(e.g. when copying a Scene you specify the Bank, Part and Scene) can use either Template or Relative mode; resulting in an extremely powerful, yet very easy to use engine.
Elements that can be copied:


Banks
Patterns
Pattern and Associated Parts
Tracks
Parts
Scenes
Recorders
Arrangements

The Manager module also includes the ability to remap sample assignments on the fly.
Simply put Source Sample Slots can be ""re-mapped"" to Target Sample Slots.
When Elements are copied; any references to the Source Sample Slot is mapped to the Target Sample Slot; for example:
Copying: Source Bank 01/A to Target Bank 04/D and mapping Source Slot Flex 001 to Target Slot Flex 007
Result: Any where that Source Slot Flex 001 is used in Source Bank 01/A; e.g. Machine Assignments, Sample Locks etc will be mapped to Target Slot Flex 007 seamlessly in Target Bank Flex 04/D 
Using the Manager module means that with just a couple of clicks entire sets can be merged together seamlessly, meaning you never have to worry about the Octatrack structure ever again.
 
The Chainer Module

The Chainer module allows the ability to create Sample Chains on the fly from various audio files.
Features include:


Ability to merge up to 64 audio files into a Sample Chain
Access to all available settings (Loop Mode, Timestretch Mode, Tempo, Trig Quantisation, Gain etc.)

Drag/drop from OctaEdit's Audio Finder module, Finder (OSX) and Explorer (Windows)

Save Sample Chain to disk
Add Sample Chain to a Sample Slot in the current Project
Edit an existing Sample Chain
Backup a Sample Chain and all Samples as an OctaEdit Chainer Archive
Restore an OctaEdit Chainer Archive for further editing.

The Analytics module provides two modes available at any time: Results and Active
Results: Provides the current results from the Analysis engine. For example, Analytics can be automatically performed when selecting Samples, to identify exactly where a sample has been utilised in a Project, and the results returned to the module.
Active: Provides the ability to identify which Banks, Patterns, Parts and Tracks are used in the current Project, Manager Source Project or Manager Target Project to allow you to identify which Elements have been used or are empty.
 
The Options Module

The Options Module provides access to the all the end user options available in OctaEdit.
Options are divided on a per-module basis; allowing you to customise various settings that best suit your workflow.
Of additional note is the ability to auto-backup your Projects prior to saving; or executing a copy within the Manager module.
 
The Support Module

The Support module provides detailed logging to assist with support and error tracking.
The Support module makes my life easier, and allows me to provide the highest level of support I can, to ensure that you have the best end user experience that you deserve.
 
 
Frequently Asked Questions
 
Supported Platforms?
OctaEdit is a native cross platform application available on:

OSX (10.9, 10.10, 10.11, 10.12)

OSX Legacy (10.5, 10.6, 10.7, 10.8)

Windows (XP to 10)

 Supported Octatrack Operating Systems?
OctaEdit v1 supports OSv1.25E and OSv1.25H
OctaEdit v2 will include support for OSv1.30
 
Is there a Manual / Videos available?
Yes. The manual, currently ~400 pages is available via this link.
I will be completely rewriting the manual to reflect the updated GUI, features and functionality of v2
A number of videos of OctaEdit v1 are available on my YouTube channel.
More videos will be made after the v2 release.
 
What if I already own OctaEdit v1?
If you previously purchased OctaEdit v1, you will automatically receive a “Full” licence for OctaEdit v2
OctaEdit v2 will be a FREE update for all existing v1 users.
 
Which version is for me?
Depends on what you want to do. Refer to the Modules section above, and the Manual regarding the functionality of each module.
If you need any clarification, or have any questions about which version would be best for you; please do contact me here, or via Elektronauts or Facebook; I'm more then happy to help.
 
Can I upgrade from the “Samples“, “Manager” or “Samples & Manager” versions to the full version of OctaEdit?
Yes. Available upgrade paths will be:

Samples -> Samples and Manager: (US$30)

Manager -> Samples and Manager: (US$30)

Samples -> Full Version: (US$80)

Manager -> Full Version: (US$80)

Samples and Manager -> Full Version: (US$50)


 
Does OctaEdit work in real-time?
Unfortunately not. This is a limitation of the Compact Flash format; only allowing one device to access the card at any point in time; either the Octatrack or your computer.
This is a limitation of the Octatrack hardware.
Additionally, the Octatrack has a very limited MIDI implementation; and no SysEx implementation.
Whilst I could develop a Midi version of OctaEdit; it would be limited to only the standard parameters (i.e. not the Setup pages) of the current Part of the current Bank in the Project.
Over midi I would not even be able to provide 10% of the functionality that exists in OctaEdit.
 
Can I Sell / Transfer my OctaEdit licence?
Yes. Please contact me for more details prior to selling.
 
Is there / will there be a demo version??
Not at present.
A demo version would either neuter OctaEdit to such a degree to defeat the purpose of a demo, and/or the development of a demo version would draw resources away from core development.
Post v2 launch, I will look at creating a demo version.
 
Will you be adding in function X, Y or Z?
Now would be a great time to let me know if you have any feature requests; or additional functionality that you would like added.
 
Will OctaEdit work with my Computer / Soundcard combination?
It should do. I've only ever had a single report from a user who told me they had issues.
To mitigate any risk; I will be publishing a simple audio playback application that will utilise the same code as OctaEdit's playback engine to ensure compatibility.
 
Do you work for/with Elektron? Are you affiliated with them in any way?
No.
I am an independent software developer who has developed OctaEdit independently, with zero support or assistance from Elektron in any way, shape or form.
Neither OctaEdit, nor I, have any affiliation with Elektron Music Machines; nor is OctaEdit supported or endorsed by Elektron; nor is any intent made to seem otherwise.
Basically, I'm just another Octatrack user :)

 
Risks & Challenges
Because OctaEdit v1 is already fully functional; and used by a wide variety of users, across OSX, PC and multiple Octatrack OS versions, I don't expect any severe challenges at this point.
The OctaEdit v2 release is about a GUI update, adding OSv1.30 support and additional functionality onto an already well established and mature code base that has been heavily used in the real world by many users.
Any potential risk or challenge will relate to time limitations (hence this campaign) or unforseen bugs within the underlying OS that will require an update.

 
What can I do to help?
Spread the word. Post links. Spam forums / social media. Tell everyone how awesome OctaEdit is. The quicker / better the IndieGoGo campaign gets funded; the quicker I get to work, the more I can concentrate on the update.
If enough funds are raised; I can quit the day job and work on the update full time; massively expediting how quickly it is release.
If even more funds are raised; I can work on some other projects, software and hardware afterwards.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Eight years ago, I got a call from my crying mother saying that my brother was in the mental hospital with a severe psychotic episode. As you can imagine, this was a fairly traumatizing experience. He was not the person who I knew him to be.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/lCk_mffvJ0A?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Looking back, it was obvious something was off. He went to the primary care doctor 11 times complaining of the same vague symptoms - headaches, unclear thoughts, and anxiety. He even went to 6 different specialists, including a trained psychiatrist, who misdiagnosed him with an anxiety disorder. All this effort cost roughly $15,000 - all wasted money leading up to this hospitalization.</p>
<p>As trained biomedical engineer, I became more motivated on studying how to better diagnose and manage the disease. There didn’t seem to be a good way to diagnose and track schizophrenia, so I sought some alternative ways to characterize his symptoms. One data type that seemed interesting to examine was the voicemails he left on my phone. It seemed like over this 5-year period the voicemails leading up to his first episode seemed more disordered, as he used new words (neologisms) and wasn’t making much sense. Therefore, I wondered if there were some features in the transcript from voicemails that could be used to reliably detect when my brother was progressing towards or away from psychotic episodes.</p>
<p>Then, a paper was published in NPJ Schizophrenia that showed linguistic biomarkers could predict psychosis onset in high-risk youths. In other words, you could predict who would or would not develop a psychotic episode from answering a very simple question like “how is your day today?” This seemed quite remarkable and showed that some of the early ideas I had around early screening for psychosis were extensible to larger numbers of patients.</p>
<p>A few weeks later I flew to New York City to meet with the authors of this study to see what could be done to translate this work to patients. As soon as I met with one of the authors, I felt as if my life calling were to commercialize this form of research. When I went there, I found out that voice biomarkers could characterize quite a few psychiatric and neurological conditions – from early-stage psychosis to depression and even Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p>This led the creation of NeuroLex, a company that aims to commercialize a universal voice test to refer patients to specialists faster. You can think of our company kind of like a Quest Diagnostics but for speech tests in the cloud. In this way, patients like my brother could be diagnosed and treated earlier, leading to better outcomes (e.g. lower duration of untreated psychosis) and lower costs ($15k→ $3-5k) through more informed referrals (e.g. primary care physicians to psychiatrists).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Voiceome Study</h3>
<p>The Voiceome Study is the world’s largest clinical study to collect voice information labeled with health traits. We have structured this trial as a 1 year ongoing competition with the goal to recruit between 10,000-100,000 patients into the study and track them weekly for a month. This will allow for calculations of voice task inter- and intra-individual variability and build machine learning models for a wide variety of labels. It will also lay out the limitations and opportunities for voice biomarker research into the future.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/J0n9J5N9xO0?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>We're launching this Indiegogo campaign to ignite greater awareness of the Voiceome Study and to support its fundraising strategy outside the non-traditional channels of grants and private foundations. It's our way of interfacing with the public at large to support our work in the form of perks and other offerings.</p>
<p>All money raised from this campaign will be used to further the Voiceome Study. Our goal is to raise around $5,000 over the next few months to cover the costs associated with modifying our clinical protocol. Any additional funds raised will be used to recruit patients into the Voiceome study via tailored marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>Feel free to check out our website @ voiceome.org where you can learn more specifically about how you can get involved. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What you get </h3>
<p>We've kept the perks fairly simple tailored for individuals, developers, and anyone looking to use SurveyLex, our voice survey platform that we are using to host the Voiceome study. Check out the perks below:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Voice health report ($5)</strong> - Give a voice sample and get back a report with health traits. The report at this link is an example report we have done in the past (with just voice features). In addition to these features (e.g. Brunet's index), we will have roughly 20 machine learning models built from data collected in Voiceome study relating to depression symptoms, caffeine consumption, exercise and nutrition habits, and many more.</li>
<li>
<strong><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Voice-Computing-Python-Schwoebel-ebook/dp/B07HLGBRWZ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Voice computing in Python </a>textbook ($20) </strong>- Paperback version discounted from $30 (33% off) on Amazon.com. This book outlines a new definition for voice computing with 200+ starter scripts on GitHub to train the next-generation of voice computing experts. You can read more about this textbook at <strong><a href=""http://neurole.ai/voicebook"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this link</a>.</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>We can already deliver on these perks, so you should have confidence that if you invest in this campaign the perks will be delivered on time.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>One of the primary causes of slow translation of voice biomarker research is a result of small datasets. There have been many research studies that have shown that acoustic or linguistic voice features relate to health conditions like stress, schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, stroke, and cardiovascular diseases. However, many of these studies have relatively small sample sizes (N&lt;1,000 patients in each class), suffer from poor audio quality (e.g. use of different microphones and data collection techniques), and are difficult to access (e.g. large licensing fees to corporations and/or difficulty obtaining IRB access without close academic ties). These factors dramatically limit the ability to model the underlying data and correlate voice data to health traits, replicate peer-reviewed publications, as well as open up this work to the broader scientific community.</p>
<p>By contributing to this Indiegogo campaign, you'll have a direct, large-scale impact on patients by supporting the Human Voiceome Study. This study will translate the work of vocal biomarkers faster to patients. Our goals with the initiative are to reach 100,000 labeled speech samples with health information by the end of 2019, and your donation here will help with that. </p>
<p>In a larger capacity, you'll help us:.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Impact patients </strong>- We can reduce up to 20,000 suicides and psychotic hospitalizations by 2023.</li>
<li>
<strong>Make new scientific discoveries</strong> - We can discover up to 50 new health correlations that we have never discovered (e.g. sleeping disorder biomarkers in the voice), which can lead to follow-on studies within industry and academia alike</li>
<li>
<strong>Improve clinical workflows</strong> - Our work fits within the collaborative care in medicine, with primary care physicians taking an instrumental role in referring at-risk patients to psychiatrists sooner - ultimately reducing the burden of mental illness through earlier, simpler interventions with fewer side effects.</li>
<li>
<strong>Build a lasting community</strong> - The Voiceome project will foster a lasting community and enthusiasm for the field of vocal biomarkers in general.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you for considering being a part of this initiative. </p>
<h3>Risks and Challenges </h3>
<p>The biggest challenge we face in achieving this goal is if we don't get enough clinical trial subjects enrolled in the Voiceome Study. This would limit the amount of information that we can provide in the form of a report from a speech sample that you provide to us. </p>
<p>Despite these risks, we believe our team is well-poised to deliver on the perks provided. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>We have strong investors and a 12 month runway </strong>- We've raised $250k from Betaworks, Lightspeed Venture Partners, GGV Capital, Launch Capital, and other angel investors. This puts us in a better position to deliver on our promises and gives us enough runway to deliver on this campaign. </li>
<li>
<strong>We have a strong product team</strong> - We've built a product, SurveyLex, to enable the completion of the Human Voiceome Study and produce a report for you reliably. You can read more about SurveyLex @ https//surveylex.com/research </li>
<li>
<strong>We have a strong research team</strong> - We have a team of &gt;40 research fellows that have been working to collect and publish data in voice biomarkers over the past 2 years, which positions us in a good place to build accurate machine learning models. You can read more about our lab @ <a href=""https://neurolex.ai/research"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://neurolex.ai/research</a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>We've built machine learning models before</strong> - We already have working machine learning models to estimate the PHQ-9 for depression and the UPDRS (a Parkinson's disease scale), so if all else fails we can still provide you relevant reports in these specific areas. </li>
<li>
<strong>We've already written the textbook in voice computing</strong> - The textbook perk has already been published and can be ordered on Amazon. You can read more about this book @ <a href=""https://neurolex.ai/voicebook"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://neurolex.ai/voicebook</a>

The Murel Venom™ securely and comfortably hugs your ears. Experience comfort and security even after hours of use. Your ears won't get fatigued liked they do with other truly wireless earbuds. - POWERFUL DESIGN - We've designed the Murel Venom™ to be as small as possible and still deliver an incredible HD audio experience. We strongly feel that current truly wireless headphones on the market completely miss the mark by designing their headphones with small and weak drivers--which produce weak and poor sound. In addition, many truly wireless headphones only offer 1-2 hours of listening between charges.IN THE BOX: YOU WILL RECEIVE: THE MUREL VENOM HEADPHONES, CHARGING CASE, 3 SIZES OF SILICON EARTIPS, USB CHARGING CABLE, AND USER MANUAL.We've taken extra care in the design and development of the Murel Venom™ charging case. The Charging case will charge your headphones up to 3 times...thereby extending your music playtime to an incredible 25.5 hours before you need to charge the case! - PERFECT FOR EVERY ACTIVITY - The Murel Venom™ is the perfect headphones for almost any activity. The unique one-size-fits all hook design keeps the headphones securely in your ears while doing the most aggressive workouts, bike riding, jumping, running, etc. Feel secure and confident your headphones will stay put doing any activity! The Murel Venom™ is also great for the not-so aggressive activities, like watching movies, taking calls, or just listening to music. The Murel Venom™ delivers HD-quality sound while doing all of your favorite activities.  - THE BEST TECHNOLOGIES - The Murel Venom™ boasts a partnership with companies like Liquipel™ and Comply™.  Liquipel™ has an incredible nano-coating treatment which protects against water and sweat. And Comply™ supplies us with foam ear tips which enhance both the sound and fitment when paired with the Murel Venom™.- MUREL ZERO - Last year we launched and successfully delivered the Murel Zero™. Our backers loved the HD-sound quality as well as the incredible strong Bluetooth™ connectivity. But we realized through customer feedback that security of the fitment was lacking.- FRANKEN-PROTOTYPE - So we set out to improve upon the current design by adding a flexible hook that wraps around the ear. We took the Murel Zero™ and a hook from another set of headphones and used special bonding puddy to create our first rough prototype of the Murel Venom™. We personally used this custom prototype in the gym and loved the fitment! We realized we were onto something big! - ROUGH SKETCHES - From the hand-made sample, we developed sketches that would give a rough outline for the dimensions of the new design.- 2D SCHEMATICS - From these rough sketches, we designed and developed in more detail the outside shell of the new design. Every angle and dimensions was added to make sure the overall form of the Murel Venom™ was covered. In fact, we used giant circles to give the outside curves their form. If you look closely you'll notice that every line on the Murel Venom™ is curved. This gives the overall design a very futuristic and avant-guard feel to it.- 3D MODEL - From the 2D design we had a 3D designer create the 3D CAD files in SolidWorks. This design only included the outside walls and did not include the inside components. Those inside details would come later once we've finalized the outside form.- RENDERINGS FIRST ROUND- We were a little early in doing the 3D photo-realistic renderings from these early 3D files. But we wanted to get an idea of how the final product would look. These renderings would later be modified and altered slightly by the factory in order to accommodate the design of the components on the inside.- DFM - ""DESIGN FOR MANUFACTURING"" - We then started to work closer with the factory. In order to get the 3D files ready to be manufactured, the factory engineers created the DFM files ""Design for Manufacturing"". These files are the final and complete files the factory will use to create the injection molding tooling, as well as source the components which will be used during the manufacturing process. The DFM file is the last step before the manufacturing process can be started.- MACHINE PROTOTYPE ONE - From the DFM files the factory produced two different sets of prototypes. These are hi-fidelity prototypes which are used to test the overall design of the headphones. As you can see in this photo, we did consider embedding wire inside the ear hook in order to allow the user to custom form the hook to fit the ear. In the end we decided against this final design. Instead, we use the natural spring of the TPU material to maintain a comfortable and snug fitment around the ear.- MACHINED PROTOTYPE TWO - The second prototype set was identical to the first with exception to the hooks--which didn't include the internal wire. We decided this was the best design for the headphones. We added some modeling paint to see how the finished and final colors would look.- FUNCTIONAL PROTOTYPE - Our last prototype is a 100% functional prototype. It features all of the electronic components that will go into the final product. This is the unit we've been testing for sound quality and Bluetooth™ distance and connectivity. We can confidently say it has exceeded our expectations. The fitment is secure and doesn't fatigue the ear. Also, The HD audio sounds incredible! And the Bluetooth™ connection is hands down the best we've ever experienced.- FINAL RENDERINGS - From the final DFM (Design for Manufacturing) 3D model we were able to generate hi-fidelity photo-realistic renderings to show how the final product will look once in production. We love how the white looks in this final design embodiment, However, we are open to doing other color combinations once certain milestone are met.- BE PART OF THE MUREL VENOM STORY - You are the last step in the Murel Venom™ story. We have come as far as we can without your support. With your support we can bring this awesome product to market and into your hands! let's do this!  We are putting together some killer Stretch Goals for the Murel Venom backers. Stay tuned...we'll announce our Stretch Goals once we are confident we'll achieve our funding goal.As part of the stretch goals...we've got some additional color options we are putting together that we think you'll love! Murel™ has multiple patents pending on the Murel Venom™.

Secondly, we have a design patent pending for the Venom's™ unique design.

Express the magnitude of what contributors will help you achieve.  Remember, keep it concise, yet personal. Ask yourself: if someone stopped reading here would they be ready to make a contribution?   What We Need & What You Get Break it down for folks in more detail:  Explain how much funding you need and where it's going. Be transparent and specific-people need to trust you to want to fund you.  Tell people about your unique perks. Get them excited! Describe where the funds go if you don't reach your entire goal.    The Impact Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know the difference their contribution will make:  Explain why your project is valuable to the contributor and to the world. Point out your successful track record with projects like this (if you have one). Make it real for people and build trust.    Risks & Challenges  People value your transparency. Be open and stand out by providing insight into the risks and obstacles you may face on the way to achieving your goal.  Share what qualifies you to overcome these hurdles. Describe your plan for solving these challenges.    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign. Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!   And that's all there is to it.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

We are asking for <strong>150,000$</strong> to speed up <strong>production</strong> and start a <strong>worldwide media campaign</strong> to promote Studio1. By supporting us you will help us on getting Agora Studio1 everywhere and settle the brand as a reliable and high quality product maker, and you can get the headphones at a bargain price! The retail price is 549$ but you can get for almost 200$ less, why this big difference of price? This is a professional product intended and designed to suit the most demanding music industry professionals which makes it costly to produce.

<p><strong>Tranquil</strong> is designed to be extremely comfortable to wear while reducing noises for multiple situations.  Tranquil allows you to reduce noises like plane engines or that disruptive snoring allowing you to achieve peace and tranquility when you want it. With a simple flip of a switch, Tranquil has the ability to change between three modes: <strong>Quiet Mode</strong> for near total silence, <strong>Voice Mode</strong> for allowing you to hear someone speaking to you while still reducing noises (can be used for conversations on an plane trip) and <strong>Sleep Mode</strong> which is used to mask noises while you sleep. Tranquil's housing is designed to fit comfortably and securely over the ear, making it discreet and nearly invisible when worn.  Tranquil is also lightweight making it comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Tranquil Can be Used Everyday </h3>
<ul>
<li>When traveling by plane or train </li>
<li>For mowing the lawn or leaf blowing </li>
<li>Sleeping in noisy settings or if disturbed by snoring</li>
<li>If you need to concentrate in noisy settings</li>
<li>If you have trouble focusing</li>
<li>When you just want quiet time to relax</li>
</ul>
<h3> Nearly Invisible when Worn </h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483137800/bwt3ihi8zl95wmfr1zw6.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Tranquil is very discreet and nearly invisible when worn because it hides behind your ear (as depicted in the line drawings above). </p>
<h3>How small is Tranquil? </h3>
<p>At only 1"" by 1.5"", Tranquil vanishes behind your ear and the clear cable connecting to the ear tip is nearly invisible when worn. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482960107/dd1e20ngkuiiqfgphjcn.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Extremely Comfortable </h3>
<p>Tranquil uses an expanding memory foam tip that gently expands to your ear canal for a perfect comfortable fit every time. Other brands may use rubber or silicone tips which can sometimes feel uncomfortable or even hurt when worn for a short time. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482960141/e4cqcfjyw1zkmpwjvn3r.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Designed for Multiple Noise Settings </h3>
<p>Tranquil has three modes: <strong>Quiet</strong> Mode, <strong>Voice</strong> Mode and <strong>Sleep</strong> Mode that are activated by a simple flip of a switch. </p>
<p><strong>Quite Mode</strong> is active and passive noise cancellation for the utmost silence when you want to reduce busy urban street noises, factory noises or for just total concentration.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482960192/ucjs5mtf8uiiceiub45o.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Voice Mode</strong> allows you to hear conversations clearly even when Tranquil's active noise cancellation is on. This means you can hear someone talking over the roar of a plane engine, or when someone wants to speak to you when you are doing tasks like mowing the lawn. Other products need to be taken off or out of your ears every time you want to talk, but this is not required when using Tranquil.</p>

<p><strong>Sleep Mode</strong> is used while sleeping if you are disturbed by a snoring partner or when there are other loud distracting noises.  </p>

<p>Tranquil's compressible foam tip provides passive noise cancellation for the high frequencies, while the device uses active noise cancellation for low frequencies.  This is <b>Quiet Mode</b>. Without the active low frequency cancellation loud sounds would be almost unchanged in volume. Tranquil's active noise cancellation uses a microphone placed inside the ear to provide the strongest low frequency noise cancellation. When in <b>Voice Mode</b>, Tranquil processes high frequency sounds electronically to allow clear voice communications. This overcomes the passive noise cancellation provided by the foam tip. The ability to allow clear communication when needed is not available on most noise cancellation systems including QuietOn and Hush. When in <b>Sleep Mode</b>, Tranquil can mask snoring sounds or other disruptive sounds to give you a restful night's sleep.</p>

<h3> FAQ's </h3>
<p><b>What makes Tranquil unique compared to other products? </b></p>
<p>Tranquil is currently the only product that hides behind your ear making it very discreet and nearly invisible.  Tranquil will remain secure on your ear and is very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. Tranquil also has multiple noise reduction modes that is unique for an active noise cancellation system. </p>
<p><b> How does Tranquil compare to standard noise ear plugs? </b></p>
<p>Normal noise earplugs are not able to block low frequency noise. Tranquil can block low frequency noise and still be used to hear speech when needed with <b>Voice Mode</b>.  When in <b>Sleep Mode</b>, Tranquil can mask snoring or other disruptive sounds.</p>
<p><b>Can I wear Tranquil with eye glasses?  </b></p>
<p>Yes, Tranquil can be worn at the same time.  Tranquil is very similar to behind the ear hearing aids worn by millions of people with eye glasses. </p>
<p><b>What is the expected battery life? </b></p>
<p>Our goal is to achieve 30 hours of use on a single charge. </p>
<p><b> What colors are available?</b></p>
<p>Currently we plan to release Tranquil only in black.</p>

</div></div>","Tranquil is designed to be extremely comfortable to wear while reducing noises for multiple situations.  Tranquil allows you to reduce noises like plane engines or that disruptive snoring allowing you to achieve peace and tranquility when you want it. With a simple flip of a switch, Tranquil has the ability to change between three modes: Quiet Mode for near total silence, Voice Mode for allowing you to hear someone speaking to you while still reducing noises (can be used for conversations on an plane trip) and Sleep Mode which is used to mask noises while you sleep. Tranquil's housing is designed to fit comfortably and securely over the ear, making it discreet and nearly invisible when worn.  Tranquil is also lightweight making it comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.
 
Tranquil Can be Used Everyday 

When traveling by plane or train 
For mowing the lawn or leaf blowing 
Sleeping in noisy settings or if disturbed by snoring
If you need to concentrate in noisy settings
If you have trouble focusing
When you just want quiet time to relax

 Nearly Invisible when Worn 

Tranquil is very discreet and nearly invisible when worn because it hides behind your ear (as depicted in the line drawings above). 
How small is Tranquil? 
At only 1"" by 1.5"", Tranquil vanishes behind your ear and the clear cable connecting to the ear tip is nearly invisible when worn. 

Extremely Comfortable 
Tranquil uses an expanding memory foam tip that gently expands to your ear canal for a perfect comfortable fit every time. Other brands may use rubber or silicone tips which can sometimes feel uncomfortable or even hurt when worn for a short time. 

Designed for Multiple Noise Settings 
Tranquil has three modes: Quiet Mode, Voice Mode and Sleep Mode that are activated by a simple flip of a switch. 
Quite Mode is active and passive noise cancellation for the utmost silence when you want to reduce busy urban street noises, factory noises or for just total concentration.

Voice Mode allows you to hear conversations clearly even when Tranquil's active noise cancellation is on. This means you can hear someone talking over the roar of a plane engine, or when someone wants to speak to you when you are doing tasks like mowing the lawn. Other products need to be taken off or out of your ears every time you want to talk, but this is not required when using Tranquil.

Sleep Mode is used while sleeping if you are disturbed by a snoring partner or when there are other loud distracting noises.

It transforms LG OLED TV into real HiFi sound systems with 3D stereo imaging like you'd normally only get from the best High End sound systems.CANVAS can also work as a stand alone wireless HiFi sound system, with AirPlay 2 and Chromecast, both multiroom compatible. It's the first one-box real HiFi system with realistic 3D stereo imaging being brought to market.CANVAS also work with any other TV, the elegance from the integrated solution with LG OLED won't be there, but you'll still get the awesome sound.                   The image quality of LG OLED TVs is now close to the highest fidelity that’s technically achievable. However, this is not the case in terms of audio, even with the best soundbars as they are still limited by the constraints of their size. High quality audio has until now required separate HiFi speakers as they’re infinitely better in terms of performance. With CANVAS we want to match the audio quality to the picture quality LG OLED TV’s without having to rely on free standing HiFi speakers.             The short answer, because they are the best. LG is the only manufacturer of large format OLED panels, so whether you buy Panasonic, Philips or Sony, it’s all LG panels inside. Thereby you get the most value for money getting an LG OLED TV. And don’t take our word for it, the vast majority of reviewers worldwide agrees LG OLED is the King of TV’s, so if you haven’t got one already, you should seriously consider getting it!      CANVAS can be used both floor standing and on the wall, with it’s optional wall mount.

</ul></div>","If you are reading this, then you probably know that Eurorack is the most ""popular"" modular synth standard nowadays.Moto Mods™ are Motorola's commitment to modular accessories in the smartphone field. At the moment two variations of the Moto Z incorporate this technology.  Motorola has also guaranteed compatibility for at least one more generation of Moto Z's.We think that despite the vast assortment of modules available now for Eurorack none of those that currently exist can offer the same usability, price and functionality as the one we are developing.The moduleAn example of the integration of Euromod into a modular synthesizer could be as follows: Euromod is a powerful tool that:
Has a form factor of a standard 32 HP Eurorack module
Accommodates a Moto Mod compatible smartphone using magnetic physical connection
Operates with a dedicated Android app or standalone
The companion app will have the option to share audio and MIDI with other apps
Can process and store digitally 4 analog signals at 24 bits and 48KHz resolution
Generate digitally 4 CV signals (14 bit resolution) from live performance, stored data and/or external MIDI
Interface controls are a combination of touchscreen, five physical level knobs and a multipurpose pushing encoder
Mix 4 analog signals and convert external MIDI to CV when smartphone is not connected
Four red/green LEDs monitor CV outputs activity
MIDI input to interconnect external gear or other modules is provided through DIN to jack special cable (provided with each euromod)
Both module firmware and dedicated app seamlessly updatable from cloud
Audiophile grade selected components

What we would like to present to you is, a story about Shenzhen and Makers, a story about doonne M1.Shenzhen, one of the China's fastest developing cities, enjoys reputations as ""City of design"", ""City of Makers"". Today, Shenzhen has become the world's largest origin for electronic products, provides one-stop service from design into production, The Economist, a British magazine, praises Shenzhen as the "" Global preferred city for hardware entrepreneurs', where entrepreneurship and maker have been integrated into the Shenzhen's blood.

As a young city only aged 30, Shenzhen's population is 15 million, most of which are young, the average age is only 30 years old, as young as the city.While we are a young team of makers from Shenzhen, mates in work and friends in life. We have common interests: Music and Sport.

Most of our team keep the habits that listing music while exercising, and often gather together with the phone and earphone to run.But the wired earphone easily get winded, the worse is that wired earphone will bound us for movements and limit our enjoyment of listening to music and playing sports freely.
However, nothing could be difficult for a group of makers. In order to solve this problem, we decided to create a wireless Bluetooth earphone, especially designed and developed for music and sports fans, which is shown in front of you now, the doonne M1.

On the basis of ideas and recommendations from our own and friends around us, we focus on three areas: the sound quality, design and performance during the development process of doonne M1.



1.Audio quality
The good audio quality is the most basic requirement of an earphone .there are a number of factors impact on the quality of the earphone, such as: type of Bluetooth chip , audio transmission protocol, earphone cavity design, sounding the horn unit, EQ for regulation, dust, etc...We should handle every detail of doonne M1 earphone well enough to create perfect sound quality.


1.1 Powerful hardware

Powerful hardware is the basis of all, the high-end bluetooth Chip CSR8645 from British CSR's is selected as the main chip, whose performance has been fully verified in market.

1.2 Powered by atp-x


Regarding the audio protocol, we adopt lossless audio code-decode and transmission protocol atp-x from CSR, which make the transmission result equals to wired earphone.

1.3 Elaborately designed acoustics structure



We designed the acoustics cavity structure of the earphone elaborately, repeatedly modified and tested every detail that could impacts on the sound effect.
1.4 A most suitable horn for doonne M1


For the most critical devices of earphone - audible horn unit, we even choose one  out of hundreds.After extensive tests and compares, a most suitable horn for doonne M1 in the chamber is finalized.


1.5 Elaborately sound adjustment



Further more, we also fine-tune the EQ parameters for chip's output according to cavity and horn of the earphone. Even the small details such as the ear cap and dust web of the earphone are carefully handled by the doonne M1 Team as well.


2.Fantasy design

In order to make M1 doonne more attractive, sense of sport and technology, and  more easily accept and use as well, we need continuous deliberate in industrial design, structural design, material selection, surface processing, function design and so on.

2.1 Iterative design 
We carried out repeated iterations in areas such as industrial design, structural design, 3D printing, etc.


2.2 Extreme dimension


We utilized every inch inside the space of the earphone, thus allowing doonne M1 has a very small size.


2.3 Magnet adsorption

For more convenient use and accept, we integrated magnet for adsorption and Hall sensors for smart switch function into doonne M1.



2.4 Advanced TPE material

Taking into account the customers may be doing a fierce campaign during using doonne M1, We need M1 doonne has sufficient strength to avoid be damaged.The wire rod for earphones, we selected a flexible, robust and advanced TPE material.

I was tired of using a mouse and a piano roll when playing VST synths. While walking down the street thinking about what MIDI keyboard to choose, I saw a guy playing a Hang instrument. Watching his hands move, I thought ""isn't this more enjoyable then pressing keys on a keyboard?""</p><p>The unexpected thrill of this eureka moment made me immediately phone my friend Ratko with an idea to make a MIDI controller shaped like a Hang instrument. We quickly realized a huge potential in <strong>adding X and Y controls to each pad</strong> and, since our first conversation about it, we were hooked.

To add even more expressiveness, I map a tremolo effect to the aftertouch.Live Act with Zvuk9In this video, I give you some ideas on how you could use Zvuk9 during a live performance by controlling audio clip levels, adjusting FX controls, and playing notes.Zvuk9 as a Synth InterfaceIn this video, I use Zvuk9 to both play and control Sub Phatty's parameters. Zvuk9 becomes an alternative synth interface, which you can use explicitly or together with the knobs and keys on the synth itself.Zvuk9 Feature List
9 pressure and position sensitive pads
Velocity sensitive (3 levels of sensitivity and 3 velocity response curves)
X and Y MIDI assignable to CC. CCs can be the same for all pads or unique per pad
X or Y can be set to send pitch bend instead of CC
Aftertouch (channel or polyphonic)
15 programs for storing settings (scale, tonic, split status, X & Y controls, on/off status for notes, aftertouch, and X and Y)
7 predefined scales available: natural minor, harmonic minor, melodic minor, major, harmonic major, pentatonic minor, and pentatonic major
10 user scales available so you can set which pad will play which note or notes
Chords can be assigned through user scales, a maximum of 7 notes can be assigned to a pad
Tonic can be set with Notes buttons
Notes buttons are illuminated, showing which notes are currently available and which note is currently playing
By default, tonic goes on Pad1; by using Notes up/down function, all notes can be moved
Encoder controls for X & Y: CC, min, max, curve
Total of 13 response curves available for X and Y
4 on/off buttons: notes, X, Y, and aftertouch
In Split mode, all controls for X and Y, state of 4 on/off buttons, and MIDI channel are unique per pad
Transport controls: play, stop, and record can be set to MCC, CC, or MCC+CC
Note off type choice (off channel, on channel/0 velocity)
All settings saved during reboot
MIDI over USB and MIDI through 3.5mm mini jack out (cable mini jack to MIDI DIN included)
It is simple to use Zvuk9To show you what we mean by simple, we recorded a few short how-to videos so you can see for yourself.HOW TO: Expressive PlayingHOW TO: X & Y Controls - CC, Min, Max, CurveHOW TO: Scale, Tonic, ChordsHOW TO: Split ModeThe IdeaA few years ago, I was planning to buy a MIDI controller. I was tired of using a mouse and a piano roll when playing VST synths. While walking down the street thinking about what MIDI keyboard to choose, I saw a guy playing a Hang instrument. Watching his hands move, I thought ""isn't this more enjoyable then pressing keys on a keyboard?""The unexpected thrill of this eureka moment made me immediately phone my friend Ratko with an idea to make a MIDI controller shaped like a Hang instrument. We quickly realized a huge potential in adding X and Y controls to each pad and, since our first conversation about it, we were hooked. After thinking about it a good while, it seemed much more logical and natural to change the playing surface to square pads and create a square shape for the controller overall, so we went with it.Now, more than 3 years later, we have fully functional prototypes of an expressive MIDI controller and control surface that is much more than just another pad-based MIDI controller.What Is the Status of the Project?Prototypes seen in the videos above are fifth generation. We put a lot of work and many upgrades into the Zvuk9 over the past 3 years to get to where we are today. We chose to wait until we had a prototype ready for use – and now we’re there and ready to offer it to you.All functionalities mentioned above on this page are fully developed and tested.Although the latest prototypes look great, we will change some minor details to improve aesthetics.

<p>GALA unveils astonishing layers of detail in music, opening up the sound-stage, improving instrument separation, and propelling rhythm with irresistible energy. Hear your favorite songs as if for the first time, and get fresh insight on the music you love. <strong>With twin flagship Burr-Brown® PCM1794As DACs</strong>, GALA will satisfy anyone who loves music, and those who are curious to hear just how good their system can sound.</p>

<p>GALA uses linear power supplies (LPS) to deliver clean DC power to its analog components. This clean DC power has very low noise, which improves the sonic quality of the music. With clean power, you get more natural and transparent music.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1544135660/x2omie8ym9upicmwqp2q.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>DACs are everywhere: in our phones, in our cable boxes, in our computers. Seriously. They're everywhere. The problem with the DACs that we find in all of our devices is simple: they're made to do the job with the least amount of effort and the lowest cost to build.</p>
<p>The GALA DAC is designed differently. Instead of just barely getting the job done, it goes the extra mile, up a hill, to get the job done well. Very well. So well that there's no other DAC that can do what it does without having to pay much more.</p>

<p>Within less than a year, the ETHER Audio team has worked closely with our design and engineering partners to bring the ETHER Transmitter from a sketch to a sleek and finalized industrial design. Building on what we learned in testing (round 1) – the A/D converters in the standard Bluetooth chip can't process the audio signal fast enough – so we need to get to our next prototype finalized and tested once more before we can bring the ETHER Transmitter to the world as an official product.</p>

<p>We’ve collected a small list of “reasons why most DJ’s haven’t trusted common transmitters”, and plan to tackle the remaining issue, latency. The critical next steps are to finish modifying the in progress Bluetooth chip for the final prototype, and begin testing the consumer version hardware (immediately). Now we’re turning to Indiegogo to raise the funds needed to finish our consumer-ready prototype and bring the ETHER Transmitter to the world.</p>

<p>When we first started developing the ETHER Transmitter, we quickly realized that we had come up with a game changing solution for the DJ community/performing artists and musicians. The Indiegogo community has been responsible for supporting some amazing projects by creators like us, and we felt that they would be equally as excited about the ETHER Transmitter. Today, we’re proud to be sharing these exciting next steps with our backers and supporters.</p>

</a><p><b>About Team ETHER</b></p>
<p>We are a small but skilled group of innovators who seek to share our creations with the world of audio heads. Our diverse backgrounds include experience in the music business, project management, finance, various aspects of product design and development, and more. After years of professional experience working on numerous projects, we all shared the common vision for this first ETHER Electronics, and decided to team up for this startup and selected the ETHER Transmitter as our pilot project. The idea for ETHER Electronics first came about during a rehearsal set, when a friend asked the simple question, “Can I pair my wireless headphones to your mixer?” Immediately we did the research to try to find a product – that we were sure exists – only to find nothing. We knew then that we had to break this barrier and change the game. After countless nights of no sleep, ETHER Transmitter began to take shape, and we enlisted the expertise of product designers, developers and engineers to help us bring the ETHER Transmitter to the point we’re at now. Just a few more steps and we’ll be able to bring the ETHER Transmitter to the world.</p>

<p><b>What’s different from the ETHER Transmitter compared to transmitters available
on the market right now? Why is it so expensive compared to those that already
exist?</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<div>
<div>
<p>The ETHER Transmitter is incomparable to existing transmitters on the market, since
we’re primarily focusing on the pro-audio users – and the professional standard is a 1/4
headphone jack. Even if you were to add a 1/4 headphone adapter to an existing
transmitter, you’re adding an extra step to the signal flow, therefore resulting to a
fraction of milliseconds added to the transmitters conversion latency rate. In short, the
ETHER Transmitter will still remain ahead of the race in regards to latency.
</p>
<p>The ETHER Transmitter is a premium product, and the materials we’re choosing to use
aren’t cheap. We focused our attention on building a high quality product that’s not only
going to be durable and sleek, in feel, but will also survive a beating and still remain
functional. Once you feel it for yourself, we can assure you that you won’t be
disappointed.
</p>
<p><b>Why isn’t there a specific latency rate being provided?

<p>Our resource has been developing a proprietary chip for the past 4 years that offers
10.5ms of latency. We plan to integrate and develop that technology into our bluetooth
transmitter, and once the development has been paid for, we’ll be able to run tests on
the modified chip to provide a solid number. We do know for certain that it will be in the
range of 10.5ms-40ms tops. Of course it’s in our best interest to get the playback
latency as close to real-time as possible.

headphones during performance.

</div></div>","The ETHER Transmitter by ETHER Electronics, is the first low-latency pro-audio all-in-one bluetooth 1/4"" adapter. It lets you instantly share wireless audio with any bluetooth capable earbuds, headphones or speakers. This is what the DJ community has been waiting for. Cut those wires, and be liberated!ETHER Transmitter will allow you to use any Bluetooth headphones or speakers to enjoy an untethered performance. It's the world's first bluetooth 1/4"" adapter designed specifically for the performer — as well as musicians interested in a low-latency wireless performance.

Low-latency during your performanceA revolutionary approach for performers seeking to cut those headphone wires while in the mix – the ETHER Transmitter will use low-latency Bluetooth technology to stream audio at an un-perceivable listening rate. Our EE team is aiming to get the latency down to as low as 10.5ms (tops 40ms), whereas average Bluetooth ranges upwards of 100ms. It’s a perfect solution for DJ’s, recording artists, and musicians.The ETHER Transmitter is perfect for...











Compatible with all pro-audio hardwareEasily play audio from any pro-hardware source ranging from DJ mixers, headphone pre-amps, guitar/bass amps, audio sound cards, and more.






ETHER Charging CaseSet the ETHER Transmitter into its Charging Case and the Status Ring will blink while charging. The charging case uses a micro-USB to provide energy to the embedded groove of the ETHER Transmitter.







ETHER Transmitter is making portable DJ’ing even better
In addition to wireless headphones, you can connect to any Bluetooth speakers as well, ￼ which allows you to DJ without having to worry about transporting massive speakers everywhere. Consider this even easier as a mobile DJ for a quick pop-up set-up.















ETHER Transmitter was thoughtfully designed to look great as well as offer perfect portability. Currently available in color choices: ETHER Blue, Green, Pink, Orange, Yellow, Red.





Prototyping & Development
Within less than a year, the ETHER Audio team has worked closely with our design and engineering partners to bring the ETHER Transmitter from a sketch to a sleek and finalized industrial design. Building on what we learned in testing (round 1) – the A/D converters in the standard Bluetooth chip can't process the audio signal fast enough – so we need to get to our next prototype finalized and tested once more before we can bring the ETHER Transmitter to the world as an official product.










Packaging Design Concepts


We’ve collected a small list of “reasons why most DJ’s haven’t trusted common transmitters”, and plan to tackle the remaining issue, latency. The critical next steps are to finish modifying the in progress Bluetooth chip for the final prototype, and begin testing the consumer version hardware (immediately). Now we’re turning to Indiegogo to raise the funds needed to finish our consumer-ready prototype and bring the ETHER Transmitter to the world.



Why IndieGoGo?
When we first started developing the ETHER Transmitter, we quickly realized that we had come up with a game changing solution for the DJ community/performing artists and musicians. The Indiegogo community has been responsible for supporting some amazing projects by creators like us, and we felt that they would be equally as excited about the ETHER Transmitter. Today, we’re proud to be sharing these exciting next steps with our backers and supporters.

About Team ETHER
We are a small but skilled group of innovators who seek to share our creations with the world of audio heads. Our diverse backgrounds include experience in the music business, project management, finance, various aspects of product design and development, and more. After years of professional experience working on numerous projects, we all shared the common vision for this first ETHER Electronics, and decided to team up for this startup and selected the ETHER Transmitter as our pilot project. The idea for ETHER Electronics first came about during a rehearsal set, when a friend asked the simple question, “Can I pair my wireless headphones to your mixer?” Immediately we did the research to try to find a product – that we were sure exists – only to find nothing. We knew then that we had to break this barrier and change the game. After countless nights of no sleep, ETHER Transmitter began to take shape, and we enlisted the expertise of product designers, developers and engineers to help us bring the ETHER Transmitter to the point we’re at now. Just a few more steps and we’ll be able to bring the ETHER Transmitter to the world.










What’s different from the ETHER Transmitter compared to transmitters available
on the market right now? Why is it so expensive compared to those that already
exist?



The ETHER Transmitter is incomparable to existing transmitters on the market, since
we’re primarily focusing on the pro-audio users – and the professional standard is a 1/4
headphone jack. Even if you were to add a 1/4 headphone adapter to an existing
transmitter, you’re adding an extra step to the signal flow, therefore resulting to a
fraction of milliseconds added to the transmitters conversion latency rate. In short, the
ETHER Transmitter will still remain ahead of the race in regards to latency.

The ETHER Transmitter is a premium product, and the materials we’re choosing to use
aren’t cheap. We focused our attention on building a high quality product that’s not only
going to be durable and sleek, in feel, but will also survive a beating and still remain
functional. Once you feel it for yourself, we can assure you that you won’t be
disappointed.

Why isn’t there a specific latency rate being provided?

Our resource has been developing a proprietary chip for the past 4 years that offers
10.5ms of latency. We plan to integrate and develop that technology into our bluetooth
transmitter, and once the development has been paid for, we’ll be able to run tests on
the modified chip to provide a solid number. We do know for certain that it will be in the
range of 10.5ms-40ms tops. Of course it’s in our best interest to get the playback
latency as close to real-time as possible.

How is this going to help the DJ community when it’s only adding another step
for us to worry about?

Pair, plug, play, and repeat. The only step you’re adding is making sure it’s charged
before a performance. This product is for those who seek mobility and freedom while
performing, without having to constantly be picking up your headphones and setting
them down. Essentially the last thing you should have to worry about are your
headphones during performance.

When will I get to choose my color?

Before we begin shipping (about a month before), we’ll send an email survey asking you
which color you’d like – based on our collection of provided colors.








Why is the estimated shipping date so far out?

As mentioned throughout the campaign, we plan to raise the funds necessary for our
final development phase. It can take up to 6 months or more to get to that point, but
there’s also a chance we could start shipping sooner – as long as everything goes
according to plan. Regardless updates will be issued.

The headphones I use aren’t made in bluetooth, will you be coming out with a
receiver at some point?

If the demand is high enough, we’ve considered making a receiver. Although the entire
purpose of our product is to completely cut the wires. This possibility would vary
according to popular demand. Maybe we’ll run a two part campaign...

<p>Hi,<br/><br/>I am planning on making an app that will allow users to vote for what music is played. This will work when one device claims themselves as the host phone which is connected to a music device such as a bluetooth speaker.</p>
<p>The host phone will then create a lobby that anyone else with the app will be able to join. The host can make the lobby private with a password or can make it public making it available for anyone to join.</p>
<p>Once people are in the lobby, they will have access to music from Spotify and other music streaming apps, and maybe even be able to access music personally installed on there device.</p>
<p>Once someone has selected a song they like, they can add it to the queue. Therefore there will be a queue of songs from anyone who is in the lobby.</p>
<p>If there is a song on that someone doesn't like, they are allowed to vote for a skip, the song will skip if there is enough votes.</p>
<p>Differences between free and paid versions.</p>
<p>Free version: Limited songs allowed to queue from that persons device. (e.g. they are allowed to queue 3 songs every hour).  Limited times they cast a vote to skip. (e.g. they are allowed to vote to skip 3 songs an hour). Also maybe some adverts, not sure as of right now.</p>
<p>Paid Version: Allowed to queue more songs (Not sure on how many yet or whether or not to make it unlimited). Allowed to vote to skip more songs. (Again not sure how many to make it).</p>
<p>The amount of times people can queue and skip songs will change depending on how many people are in the lobby. e.g. (If there are only 2 people controlling the music at a party of 20, then the 2 people will join the lobby and they will be able to queue 10-20 songs per hour).</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Challenges are going to be giving access to music already installed on someones device and being able to cast that to the host device through the app as the host device may not have that song installed on their device.<br/>I feel like this might be possible but people will still have access to other music through Spotify, Youtube etc.</p>
<p>Not sure if I will be able to give people access to Spotify premium if they pay for my app without having to pay for Spotify Premium. <br/>Again people will still have access to the free version of Spotify if this isn't possible but they will also have access to other music streamers such as Youtube.</p>

Why you need it?

 Apple has already launched the new Apple watch. It has fantastic functions which give a new user experience to us. It can wireless control all kind of things. However, many high quality earphones have not provide wireless version.. That means we must buy a Bluetooth earphones or a Bluetooth receiver. However,,,
Most existing Bluetooth ear buds are too large and uncomfortable, or very expensive

Using Bluetooth receiver can turn most of the ear buds into wireless earphones. However, existing design is for specific short cable earphones. Using with normal earphones such as Apple earpods will be inconvenienceAdvantage of using cable3

cable3 combine the function of Bluetooth receiver and cable management which provide a new wireless experience for user. It is simple and cool!Simple and quick steps to manage your cable Simple & tidyEasy to storeComparison with existing solutions

Timeline of Project

After
 a few months of intensive prototyping, we have arrived at a finalized 
form/function that we satisfied with. With a successful demand at 
indiegogo, we will rapidly move to manufacturing plans and delivery.




Who we are?

Why we need your funding?
By FUNDING our campaign, we will be able to proceed with the actual manufacturing process of cable3, which will require a minimum quantity to achieve the best lowest cost for you. We would also require funding for the final stage of manufacturing, tooling and packaging costs. To make our campaign a success, we need your support and contribution.


Why funding us?
If you are interested in our design, please FUND 
us now as we would need to keep the momentum going. We are sure that you will love it more when you get a real one! Every dollar counts 
and we will really appreciate all your support to bring cable3 to reality.Become a backer! This campaign is a very secure and exclusive way for you to get our products at an unbeatable price.

Where does your money go?
We just want to bring cable3 to reality so nearly 100% of the money we will collect will be used to making the product
 themselves. It will cover the tooling, unit price and packaging cost.

On Flykers we did not want that the earphones look like a hearing aid, Air One is a elegant wireless player that preserves the aesthetics of old headphones removing unnecessary cables and adding a couple of microphones. Comfort is something essential so the Air One model adapts perfectly to the auditory canal achieving a comfort and stability that allows hours and hours of reproduction without feeling the typical ear discomfort of old earphones.To ensure the fit, we have analyzed different types of ears, after that we decided to design three different sizes of silicone tips to achieve the best adaptation to the ear canal, easy placement and good grip The playback time of the Air One is more than 3 hours and the charging box offers more than 24 additional hours of battery.  The Flykers Air One use Bluetooh 4.2, the most reliable bluetooh version  that guarantees optimal connection and excellent data transfer. Air One connects over IPV6 to decrease energy consumption and provide safer internet access.  We have tested the new version bluetooh 5.0 which causes a multitude of errors when you connect to other devices and interrupts the connection during data transfer, so we consider that it is  still an immature version.  We consider that bluetooth version 4.2 is currently the most suitable and reliable for wireless players. If while you are using them starts to rain you don´t need to worry because Air One model is sweatproof so you can use it when the weather conditions are not good.  Once the first pairing is done,  Flykers will automatically connect by pressing both buttons at the same time. You can do all kinds of activities with the Air One model.  Air One is designed to perform multiple functions with a single button control.

In modern society people spend long hours behind a desk. Headphones are an important part of that place. This created the need for a product that could<strong> hold our headphones</strong> for us, which enables <strong>a clean working space</strong>. The product is making the life of the user much more convenient, since the product is tackling many problems. Plus it's all put in a durable casing, with<strong> zero environmental impact</strong>. Seeing the branch doesn't have such a similar product, we have decided to take action.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532028666/sen6u4gep8wavtdnvnci.png"" src=""""/></p><p>When we started developing and designing the stand, we found some other needs and implemented these into the product. The first need was to <strong>control the volume of your headphones</strong> with one physical knob, so we placed one on the product. The second need was to have the possibility to<strong> wirelessly connect with your pair of wired headphones</strong>. This makes that you can easily enjoy some high-quality music via <strong>Bluetooth </strong>from your smartphone. And if you want to switch back to your wired source, a <strong>desktop, laptop, record player or anything else</strong>, you just<strong> switch</strong> back<strong> in one click</strong>. This is all done by using the second knob put on the product. And since we appreciate good music, we strive for a super clean sound. We therefore integrated some ingenious solutions and deliver an external ground-loop. This results in a <strong>clean listening experience without any unwanted noises.</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532089659/rel0nb0jfdmcajotyswr.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532029443/li8gpxaslwpzgkzsskxf.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/021/642/108/7908d0e68f3b95347149f19df8f30750_original.gif?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1529493576&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=b20af384985ca10807361367260d1b20"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532028729/zlbkg41ksdjv93sfaxst.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532028764/ik1lzwcum9qrj2osrgxo.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532029485/u5yy0a8vhydodo7sjwvm.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532075596/l5n1uahkysvggk0i1xjc.png"" src=""""/></p><p>The headphonestand is a <strong>unique product</strong> which will be sold in limited numbers.

Equipped with two knobs to adjust sound and switch between sources to improve your audio usage.Headphones shouldn’t suffer on your desk or on some cheap plastic. This stand is made from an authentic combination of wood and aluminum. These natural yet durable materials ensure your headset to rest conveniently. Our handcrafted Dutch design fits right in place when deployed.The Kubuni Headphonestand originated from a couple of problems. In modern society people spend long hours behind a desk. Headphones are an important part of that place. This created the need for a product that could hold our headphones for us, which enables a clean working space. The product is making the life of the user much more convenient, since the product is tackling many problems. Plus it's all put in a durable casing, with zero environmental impact. Seeing the branch doesn't have such a similar product, we have decided to take action.When we started developing and designing the stand, we found some other needs and implemented these into the product. The first need was to control the volume of your headphones with one physical knob, so we placed one on the product. The second need was to have the possibility to wirelessly connect with your pair of wired headphones. This makes that you can easily enjoy some high-quality music via Bluetooth from your smartphone. And if you want to switch back to your wired source, a desktop, laptop, record player or anything else, you just switch back in one click. This is all done by using the second knob put on the product. And since we appreciate good music, we strive for a super clean sound. We therefore integrated some ingenious solutions and deliver an external ground-loop. This results in a clean listening experience without any unwanted noises.The headphonestand is a unique product which will be sold in limited numbers. We especially grant crowdfunding backers the option to choose from four different kinds of wood for their stand. Backers who choose a special edition are granted with a personal engraving on the stand. You can choose your engraving and the kind of wood in the survey at the end of the campaign. The whole package of components is wrapped in a durable and handcrafted casing. We've used high-quality aluminum, together with a few very beautiful wood veneers. All the materials were selected with quality and environment in mind, and are crafted with ultra-precision. The beauty of the product is the combination of techniques used to produce. The wood parts are fabricated using pure craftsmanship and traditional methods. The steel parts are laser cut and bent by using more modern techniques. The assembly is done by hand in our own workshop in the Netherlands. We can guarantee qualitative products, put together with care and passion.We carefully select our material suppliers for quality and environmental friendliness. Although this comes at a price, it does make a difference. The same goes for our components, when possible we select the more reliable suppliers. This is sadly not the case on almost all products on the market today. The product is designed so it can be easily repaired and disassembled for recycling. This is how we make a circular economical product. The remaining environmental costs are invested in projects helping earth. This will be made possible by multiple charities. In the end you will enjoy a beautiful product, and the earth isn't negatively affected.The quality of the product is of significant importance. We regularly check on the production process and make sure every stand is checked on damage before shipment. If your stand is not as it should be, we will gladly hear from you.Inside of the product are several components, all with the cause to improve audio quality and provide you ease of use. We use high-grade Qualcomm chips to realize precise wireless sound, with full bass. To make sure there are no unwanted noises whatsoever, we also implemented an isolated converter to guarantee there’s no interference noise. Should there be any noise from your own device, no problem: you can connect the delivered ground loop with your cables for optimal sound. The volume control and switching system we use are high-grade analog parts, what also applies to the aux-ports.If you do not have a credit card you can use the button below to go to our website and buy one via PayPal.

<h3>The Story Behind:</h3>
<p>MONSTERKUT is designed by a group of DJs who have been scratching over a decade. Since we have been there, done that, we know it is a long journey to learn scratch and lots of people quit or end up with scratching sloppy after hitting the wall. From the actual feedbacks, many of them had problems to well clicking the crossfader. Scratch should be fun and easy. We kept looking for solutions to redesign crossfader and help people enjoy scratch easier; however, none of the mechanism worked. Finally, we saw Dj VaZee posted a DJM-S9 Pad Scratch video on YouTube, and it was the inspiration behind MONSTERKUT. </p>
<p>We understand traditional turntablists might think that the cutting skills they spent years to practice should not be sold in push button form. However, the true scratch master like Dj Q-Bert would not even bother about it because your scratch flow is the most important thing above all the invented technics.<br/><br/>Using MONSTERKUT does not guaranty you a good scratch flow. You still need to learn how to combine those cutting technics to form your own style. Using MONSTERKUT will not turn you into Dj Q-Bert or Dj D-Style in one second; however, it will definitely save you a lot of time on practicing those fundamental cutting technics which many people can’t even nail in years of practicing.<br/><br/>If you are a crossfader advocator, MONSTERKUT is also a good educational tool for beginner scratchers learning the sounds of certain cuts they are practicing on and they can try with crossfader to replicate what MONSTERKUT can do.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<p>MONSTERKUT‘s built-in audio IC chops sounds with laser sharp accuracy. It is precise to nano second cutting time.</p>
<p>The analog audio circuit design reproduces the best sound quality you want. </p>
<p>Since putting over-engineered scratch patterns in each pad will lose the originality and make everybody cuts with the same flow, we only put truly essential technics that can be combined to form all the invented scratch combos.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Challenges </h3>
<p>As using trigger pads to scratch is newly invented, you might need a moment to get used to it. </p>
<p>If you are wondering if MONSTERKUT can do all the tricks you used to do with crossfader, please check out the videos in our social media and you will be amazed by its ability!</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>I/O connection</h3>
<p>MONSTERKUT has RCA IN, RCA OUT, AUX IN, GND and mini USB power port.</p>

<h3>USB Powered</h3>
<p>MONSTERKUT is USB powered! It means you can power it up with power bank, laptop usb port or any device with 5v, 1A USB power outlet.</p>

Using MONSTERKUT will not turn you into Dj Q-Bert or Dj D-Style in one second; however, it will definitely save you a lot of time on practicing those fundamental cutting technics which many people can’t even nail in years of practicing.If you are a crossfader advocator, MONSTERKUT is also a good educational tool for beginner scratchers learning the sounds of certain cuts they are practicing on and they can try with crossfader to replicate what MONSTERKUT can do.
 
Technology
MONSTERKUT‘s built-in audio IC chops sounds with laser sharp accuracy. It is precise to nano second cutting time.
The analog audio circuit design reproduces the best sound quality you want. 
Since putting over-engineered scratch patterns in each pad will lose the originality and make everybody cuts with the same flow, we only put truly essential technics that can be combined to form all the invented scratch combos.

 
Challenges 
As using trigger pads to scratch is newly invented, you might need a moment to get used to it. 
If you are wondering if MONSTERKUT can do all the tricks you used to do with crossfader, please check out the videos in our social media and you will be amazed by its ability!

 
I/O connection
MONSTERKUT has RCA IN, RCA OUT, AUX IN, GND and mini USB power port.
 
USB Powered
MONSTERKUT is USB powered! It means you can power it up with power bank, laptop usb port or any device with 5v, 1A USB power outlet.

Share this campaign with your friends and spread the word!</b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><h2><b>FAQ</b></h2><div><b>Q: How long will it take before they are on the market?</b></div><div>
<b>A: </b>Assuming that the crowd-funding for the manufacturing goes well it would take approximately 9-12 months. 2 months for finalising the design, 1 month for running production crowd-fund and 6-9 month for manufacturing (hard to say exact manufacturing time before the design is ready and factories have been contacted).<b> </b>
</div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b>Q: What will the price of the Armadillo Headphones be?</b></div><div>
<b>A: </b>I aim at making them in the price range of $120-220, and will select materials and manufacturing methods accordingly to get there. This means they will be higher end cans, but in my opinion still reasonably priced for what you are getting. </div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b>Q: What sort of sound signature will the headphones have?</b></div><div>
<b>A: </b>The Armadillo Headphones will be going for a neutrally tuned sound, which means that the artists will have the final say on how their music should sound. This will also help in further differentiating the product as there are already many bass-boosted models on the market.</div><div><br/></div><div><b>Q: How will durability be ensured?</b></div><div>
<b>A: </b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Durability will be ensured by what is known as ""over-engineering"" (using higher safety factors than dictated by the norm). This will result in a design that is probably sturdier (and bulkier) than it needs to be for real-life situations, but for me that is okay as I love products that are built this way. In the future I want to imagine someone having a pair of Armadillo Headphones that have served extensive use for many years but still works great. I want them to be a life companion for audio enthusiast, and a life companion should not die after 3 years.</span>
</div></div>","For audio enthusiasts headphones are a very personal and important possession that will be brought almost everywhere. Despite this, portability is an attribute distinctly lacking in headphones on the market today. The methods for folding are often inefficient or involve an excessive amount of steps.I want to change this by creating a high quality, portable and durable pair of headphones that will become an integral part in the lives of audio enthusiasts all around the world.

This mission started during my third year in college when I came upon a way of making large headphones fold more compactly. This discovery resulted in the Armadillo Design.



The idea for how to improve foldability is very simple at its core. Headphones only really need to absorb forces from the direction of the user's head. By making the headband out of multiple links, a spine-like structure is created: a design which can easily fold inwards while providing rigidity when bent outwards.

Share this campaign with your friends and spread the word!FAQQ: How long will it take before they are on the market?
A: Assuming that the crowd-funding for the manufacturing goes well it would take approximately 9-12 months. 2 months for finalising the design, 1 month for running production crowd-fund and 6-9 month for manufacturing (hard to say exact manufacturing time before the design is ready and factories have been contacted). 
Q: What will the price of the Armadillo Headphones be?
A: I aim at making them in the price range of $120-220, and will select materials and manufacturing methods accordingly to get there. This means they will be higher end cans, but in my opinion still reasonably priced for what you are getting. Q: What sort of sound signature will the headphones have?
A: The Armadillo Headphones will be going for a neutrally tuned sound, which means that the artists will have the final say on how their music should sound. This will also help in further differentiating the product as there are already many bass-boosted models on the market.Q: How will durability be ensured?
A: Durability will be ensured by what is known as ""over-engineering"" (using higher safety factors than dictated by the norm). This will result in a design that is probably sturdier (and bulkier) than it needs to be for real-life situations, but for me that is okay as I love products that are built this way. In the future I want to imagine someone having a pair of Armadillo Headphones that have served extensive use for many years but still works great. I want them to be a life companion for audio enthusiast, and a life companion should not die after 3 years.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

When receiving (Rx), Jackson converts your wired audio gears, like headphones, home stereo or car stereo, into wireless with Hi-Fi sound quality. While transmitting, Jackson sends out audio wirelessly from TVs, monitors, game consoles, Desktops, iPods or any device that streams audio signal via AUX port. Jackson follows minimalist design philosophy, slick, effective and functional. Full metal frame holds everything together and provides protection from drop or scratch. Card-size and money clip designs make Jackson portable for you to carry anywhere. We are able to keep Jackson as thin as 0.4"" even with Brobdingnagian battery inside, so that you don't feel it in the way when carrying around. We determined to make Jackson firmware upgradeable so you can enjoy the latest and the greatest features when they are available.  One of the biggest pain points for wireless portable devices is battery life. With some sacrifices in design, we are able to cram 1450mAh Lithium Polymer battery into Jackson to provide whole day music streaming (longer with mp3 playing). So no worries about losing power during hiking or bike ride. We are serious about sound quality, and so should you. You don't want your high end audio gear to sound crappy when extend it with a crappy amplifier. Traditional Bluetooth adapter does not provide decent amplifier, but we are here to change that by putting in the best headphone amplifier in industry so that you cannot hear any noise or pop while enjoying natural crystal clear music. We are the first to integrate microSD card mp3 playing capability into Bluetooth transceivers. Jackson can be used as a standalone device now without attaching to a smartphone, for instance. Collect all your favorite music onto a microSD card, Jackson will play them back for you either in-order or in shuffle, for a very long time.

Sometimes this delay is up to 15 seconds and it means that you hear the touchdown, home run, goal or jump shot on radio before the play even begins on TV.</p><p><strong>Voice of the Team Radio allows you to delay the local radio play-by-play broadcast so that it lines up with the video on the TV.</strong></p><p> </p><h3><strong>The Radio Call Is Just Better</strong></h3><p>There are many reasons that the local radio play-by-play call is better than the national TV announcers, but the reasons mainly boil down to three things:</p><p>1) The local radio announcer has called nearly every game for years.  They know the team inside out, and have been through all the ups and downs and wins and losses.  The national TV crew changes for every game and so their analysis is often obvious or off target.</p><p>2)  The local radio announcer focuses on the action, while the TV crew has been told that since the viewer can see the action, they should instead focus on analysis, anecdotes and storylines.  With a lot of time to fill, it’s no wonder that much of the TV commentary is uneven, at best.</p><p>3)  (Most importantly) The local radio announcer loves our team like we do!  Just like us, they get excited when things go well and they are down when things aren’t going well.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517421763/u4uxmcwozrnpvokd50gp.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3><strong>Sports Radio Play-by-Play is Alive and Well</strong></h3><p>Every professional major league sport team in North America has a local radio play-by-play announcer.  Similarly, almost all college sports have a dedicated radio announcer too. These announcers are chosen by the teams themselves and are given titles like “Voice of the Wildcats"" or “Voice of the Ground Hogs” or whatever the team mascot is called.</p><p>At game time, the team’s games are often broadcast across an affiliate network of smaller local radio stations in the team’s geographic region.  These smaller stations retransmit the game as it originates from the team’s home town station known as the “flagship station.”  For instance, the St Louis Cardinals’ games originate over flagship station KMOX 1120AM in St. Louis, but are then rebroadcast by over 100 affiliate stations across the middle of the country.</p><p>Any person within that large listening area can hear the game on radio, but each of them may experience a slightly different delay between their radio and TV.  This difference in delay depends on which station their radio is tuned to, and which cable or satellite provider their TV is connected to.  Also, at times an additional TV lag is added by the network for non-technical reasons, like to avoid curse words or wardrobe malfunctions.</p><p>A radio with a user-adjustable delay solves this problem.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>The Solution</strong></h3><p>The solution is simple to describe:  Take an AM/FM radio, run the signal into an adjustable digital delay, and then send that delayed sound out through the speaker.  But designing this function to be easy to use with high quality sound at a reasonable price has been a challenge.</p><p>After a year and a half of design efforts, we now have a working prototype that meets all those goals.  The prototype appears in the photos further down, but this is the design for the final production version.</p><p><strong>Design for the Final Production

Team Radio is a solid, straightforward AM/FM radio with enough digital storage to allow for up to 20 seconds of delayed sound with high fidelity.</p><p>Allowing the radio user to adjust the delay themselves means that the radio audio and TV video can be sync’d for any situation.</p><p> </p><h3>Easy to Use</h3><p>Simply dial in the radio station carrying the local broadcast of the game:</p><p><strong>On AM band</strong><br/>(shown on prototype)</p><p><img class=""lazy""

Sometimes this delay is up to 15 seconds and it means that you hear the touchdown, home run, goal or jump shot on radio before the play even begins on TV.Voice of the Team Radio allows you to delay the local radio play-by-play broadcast so that it lines up with the video on the TV. The Radio Call Is Just BetterThere are many reasons that the local radio play-by-play call is better than the national TV announcers, but the reasons mainly boil down to three things:1) The local radio announcer has called nearly every game for years.  They know the team inside out, and have been through all the ups and downs and wins and losses.  The national TV crew changes for every game and so their analysis is often obvious or off target.2)  The local radio announcer focuses on the action, while the TV crew has been told that since the viewer can see the action, they should instead focus on analysis, anecdotes and storylines.  With a lot of time to fill, it’s no wonder that much of the TV commentary is uneven, at best.3)  (Most importantly) The local radio announcer loves our team like we do!  Just like us, they get excited when things go well and they are down when things aren’t going well. Sports Radio Play-by-Play is Alive and WellEvery professional major league sport team in North America has a local radio play-by-play announcer.  Similarly, almost all college sports have a dedicated radio announcer too. These announcers are chosen by the teams themselves and are given titles like “Voice of the Wildcats"" or “Voice of the Ground Hogs” or whatever the team mascot is called.At game time, the team’s games are often broadcast across an affiliate network of smaller local radio stations in the team’s geographic region.  These smaller stations retransmit the game as it originates from the team’s home town station known as the “flagship station.”  For instance, the St Louis Cardinals’ games originate over flagship station KMOX 1120AM in St. Louis, but are then rebroadcast by over 100 affiliate stations across the middle of the country.Any person within that large listening area can hear the game on radio, but each of them may experience a slightly different delay between their radio and TV.  This difference in delay depends on which station their radio is tuned to, and which cable or satellite provider their TV is connected to.  Also, at times an additional TV lag is added by the network for non-technical reasons, like to avoid curse words or wardrobe malfunctions.A radio with a user-adjustable delay solves this problem. The SolutionThe solution is simple to describe:  Take an AM/FM radio, run the signal into an adjustable digital delay, and then send that delayed sound out through the speaker.  But designing this function to be easy to use with high quality sound at a reasonable price has been a challenge.After a year and a half of design efforts, we now have a working prototype that meets all those goals.  The prototype appears in the photos further down, but this is the design for the final production version.Design for the Final Production VersionThe Voice of the Team Radio is a solid, straightforward AM/FM radio with enough digital storage to allow for up to 20 seconds of delayed sound with high fidelity.Allowing the radio user to adjust the delay themselves means that the radio audio and TV video can be sync’d for any situation. Easy to UseSimply dial in the radio station carrying the local broadcast of the game:On AM band(shown on prototype)On FM band(shown on prototype) Then, make a rough guess how many seconds the radio broadcast is ahead of the TV and twist the “Delay” knob on the radio until the display shows that many seconds.  If it’s still just a bit off, you can increase or decrease the delay by 0.5 second increments until the radio commentary matches the TV action:Delayed 8.5 seconds(shown on prototype)Certain actions on the TV can often be lined up exactly with the radio sound.  For instance, you can hear the crack of a bat in a baseball game over the radio while watching it on the TV.  When the radio sound and the TV seem aligned, you’re done.  Now you can fully enjoy the game!Additional Streaming Audio Input FeatureAlthough not in the Prototype, the Production version will have an 3.5mm Mini-plug jack for input of internet streaming audio from your own device.  This will allow you to delay streaming audio in addition to the AM/FM broadcasts.  The delayed streaming audio will then play from the radio's speaker. Delaying the radio is simple   FundingTo take the radio to production we need funding for the following:1)  Layout of the circuit board to factory specsOur prototype circuitboard does not match the final front panel design.  In addition, the design has not been maximized for manufacturing processes.  These items will require additional engineering work between our engineers and the factory’s engineers.2)  Creation of factory tooling to manufacture the front panel on the radio3)  Testing and safety certifications4)  Travel to the factoryAll of our experience has shown that being at the factory when the manufacturing begins is extremely important for verifying that all of the materials and processes are correct.5)  All manufacturing material and labor costs Meet the TeamThe three members of the team have over 60 years of experience in the design and sale of high tech products, especially consumer electronics.

It does all the hard work for you so you can focus on more creative aspects. Earn a lot of inspiration back and make your songwriting a million times faster.  Toneroll is designed to accommodate every musician – from the hobbyist to the professional composer. Whether you’re trying to streamline your creative process or just want to simplify it. The app is online and developed to transcribe any musical instrument.   With Toneroll you can just play your instrument while the system perceives and draws your composition over the piano roll in real-time, including single notes and chords. Never again pause to write notes on the paper, never having to record your music in order to transcribe it later. The piano roll grid is a method of graphically displaying MIDI note data, used broadly in DAW and sequencer software. The notes are graphically displayed as bars on the grid, with the increasing time going to the right, and increasing pitch going upwards.In “edit” mode you can drag the notes around the grid, delete or create new ones. In this way you can finalize your composition and bring your initial idea into completion.Toneroll comes ready to export your transcription into several file formats, including sheet music and midi. Means that you can utilize your composition through any music software such as Ableton Live, Pro Tools, Finale etc.
Export a midi file and get your idea even further.
Export a music notation file and utilize it in your favourite scorewriter software.
Export audio files if you want to finalize and get your idea into production stage.
Toneroll consists of an efficient but also simple workspace. Τhe UI includes a multi-channel workspace, which is essential for music making. In this way, you are able to add multiple tracks to compose for multiple instruments, insert a track to play along, or even to log ideas variants around one composition. The application is online, meaning that you can use it in your device’s web browser without download anything. Use the app anywhere, with any device. All you have to do is to grab your instrument and start composing. That’s it!  Toneroll’s musical intelligence is powered by some broadly evaluated music information retrieval algorithms, covering fields from digital signal processing to machine learning, that are released now for the first time in a web application. The application is built over the Web Audio API which is the latest standard for sound on web browsers.The system analyzes the input audio signal and extracts every possible feature to ensure that it will understand what you’ve played. To achieve this it needs to be sure for when the notes started and ended, along with their pitch and velocity. This information is combined with the tempo calculation in order to build the final composition. What we have so far is a working prototype which is a melody transcriber. This version represents a specific range of functionality, yet it shows a clear promise for the upcoming developments. Check out the prototype version now, and get excited about what’s to come!  Try Toneroll online here! Bringing the official version of Toneroll into life is no easy task and requires thousands of hours of coding, researching and testing. For this reason, we are using a crowdfunding  campaign to fuel this  long  time development process. We believe that plenty  of musicians  around  the  world  are  interested  in such an innovative application, thus with our dedication and your financial and moral support, this project can become reality.  The best part is that Toneroll’s key feature will be completely free! Every user will be able to transcribe music online with just a few clicks. In order to achieve this, a way to maintain the project and evolve are premium subscriptions that will provide additional user benefits. We need Toneroll to be a self-sustaining open-source platform, and not slowly die when the campaign funds run out.The crowdfunding campaign is all about building Toneroll v1.0 and releasing it. This is just the beginning. More funding will allow us to start bringing our master plan to life. Our  deepest desire is to create an innovative open-source music making web platform on top of the automatic music transcription tool that we are currently developing.A platform where music enthusiasts can compose, jam, collaborate, train, learn and discover. A professional musician can easily log moments of inspiration, an amateur musician can learn how to play a song, a music teacher can educate his students, even a music producer can find samples for her tracks.*We will provide more info as long as we will get closer to these goals.Our team consists of developers, musicians and audio engineers that got inspired and were brought together by the love for music.

Let’s take, for example, a BMW M3 and a Tesla Model S. Are they both powerful? Yes, are they both rewarding from a driving point of view? Absolutely yes. Do they both take you places? Yes! Are they the same? No, they are radically different on a philosophical level and they both accomplish excellence in their own field. Can we compare Bone Conduction to, let's say, a Bose headset? No. They both serve a purpose, they both do the same job, but in different ways. Would we suggest you to use Bone Conduction to listen to Mozart's Ave Maria as the ultimate gadget to experience it? Probably not. Would we suggest you to use the JUNO while riding your motorcycle? Absolutely yes! We don't pretend that Bone Conduction is your perfect HiFi music companion, but we can say that it serves a specific purpose, which increases your safety in an infinite number of situations. The Military and Google chose Bone Conduction for some of their devices...They must have thought it was not that bad, and so did nature with Dolphins and whales. It is totally possible to have a good quality phone conversation with the JUNO, and best of all without looking completely weird, because let's not forget, the JUNO are kind of good looking too. Wind and movement are handled quite well, provided you're not driving at 150 mph without a helmet. The Microphone is awesome and much better than most phones due to the specific positioning in the nose bridge, which is 100% original to this project.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525005492/ej4wefyx1u1bggtniyo6.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The battery can be replaced, although it comes with a 2 years warranty. It requires some minor and simple soldering. The reason we chose this solution was to save weight and space. JUNO are light, cool looking, flexible yet very solid and compact. We tested BT through bodies, quite some distance (More than 30 ft.) and it handled things perfectly, BT 5 works amazingly well. We can safely say that for the amount of resources we had so far (We're not a billion dollars company), we managed to develop a product that goes beyond expectations. We came up with real solutions and in an original way, which is also why we filed or are filing patents. We're pretty proud of what we achieved so far. We're very proud of the pros that using BCT brings to the general public. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524398359/qhicia0c7pvldq8qpec5.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524390215/pnhzw0ntrxwuj2lm7hn7.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>General Dimensions Of JUNO</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524390272/wmfw2hby2ppqcdavocoh.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>BENEFITS OF JUNO</h3><ul>

Let’s take, for example, a BMW M3 and a Tesla Model S. Are they both powerful? Yes, are they both rewarding from a driving point of view? Absolutely yes. Do they both take you places? Yes! Are they the same? No, they are radically different on a philosophical level and they both accomplish excellence in their own field. Can we compare Bone Conduction to, let's say, a Bose headset? No. They both serve a purpose, they both do the same job, but in different ways. Would we suggest you to use Bone Conduction to listen to Mozart's Ave Maria as the ultimate gadget to experience it? Probably not. Would we suggest you to use the JUNO while riding your motorcycle? Absolutely yes! We don't pretend that Bone Conduction is your perfect HiFi music companion, but we can say that it serves a specific purpose, which increases your safety in an infinite number of situations. The Military and Google chose Bone Conduction for some of their devices...They must have thought it was not that bad, and so did nature with Dolphins and whales. It is totally possible to have a good quality phone conversation with the JUNO, and best of all without looking completely weird, because let's not forget, the JUNO are kind of good looking too. Wind and movement are handled quite well, provided you're not driving at 150 mph without a helmet. The Microphone is awesome and much better than most phones due to the specific positioning in the nose bridge, which is 100% original to this project.The battery can be replaced, although it comes with a 2 years warranty. It requires some minor and simple soldering. The reason we chose this solution was to save weight and space. JUNO are light, cool looking, flexible yet very solid and compact. We tested BT through bodies, quite some distance (More than 30 ft.) and it handled things perfectly, BT 5 works amazingly well. We can safely say that for the amount of resources we had so far (We're not a billion dollars company), we managed to develop a product that goes beyond expectations. We came up with real solutions and in an original way, which is also why we filed or are filing patents. We're pretty proud of what we achieved so far. We're very proud of the pros that using BCT brings to the general public.   General Dimensions Of JUNOBENEFITS OF JUNO

Loqu NanoBuds DUO can provide up to 4.5 hours of listening or talking. And thanks to the charging case, the battery life can be increased up to 37 hours. In standby mode, the headphones can work up to 200 hours.
We have provided our Loqu NanoBuds DUO headset with a fast charge function. 60 minutes is enough to fully charge the earphone and about 30 minutes to work for several hours. Connect one earpiece or a pair of headphones and increase the time listening to music. With Loqu NanoBuds DUO is no longer a problem!


Ergonomic design and comfortable fit
Our team has been working on headphone design for a long time. We were able to combine minimalism, modern trends and a comfortable fit with ease of use. Thanks to its design and size, you can move around, play sports and not be afraid that Loqu NanoBuds will fall out.

Bluetooth 5 technology
Many headphones are still built on BT 4 / 4.1 technology. In our device, we use BT 5 with backward compatibility with older devices. This means that you can use Loqu NanoBuds with any cheap or expensive products.
BT 5 provides instant pairing and the most reliable connection to your device along with minimal audio playback delay. Just open the headphone case, take out the Loqu NanoBuds and you can immediately plunge into the world of music. Manual configuration is no longer needed!
The radius of Loqu NanoBuds is also amazing! In open space, the radius of the headphones up to 15 meters and up to 10 meters indoors. This is real freedom from wires.

New sound level
Yes, we also love listening to music and sound quality for us on high place. That is why we have tried to do everything possible to ensure that Loqu NanoBuds meets the requirements of even the most captious music lover. HiFi, heavy bass, clean vocals, 10 mm Graphene driver and technology of 360º - that's all you need to feel at a concert favorite artist.

Small and comfortable
Loqu NanoBuds small and light as a feather! The size of one earphone is 2.5x1.4 cm, and the weight is only 4 grams. They will not give you discomfort.

IPX5 moisture protection
Loqu NanoBuds headphones are IPX5 protected. This means that you can play sports and not be afraid of moisture or sweat. Your headphones will remain intact.

<p>...started in 2009 following the loss of my older brother, Lt Col Mark Jennings (left). I inherited his vinyl collection with no playback system. Eventually I bought an old turntable for $50 and a receiver which blew a circuit. I went online and found a video on how to fix it. Next came vintage speakers and then vacuum tube audio and one DIY project led to another.</p>
<p>In the 12 years since his passing I developed an eye (and ear) for high-end vintage audio equipment and by necessity taught myself to refurbish and repair a wide variety of electronics. Late last year I set out to build a vintage style tube based preamplifier from scratch. In the process I invented the world's first Tube Rolling Preamplifier and shortly after filed a patent application with the USPTO.</p>
<p>My formal education in design, combined with 20+ successful years in tech (10 years of support, documentation, development, sales, consulting and another 10 years Project Management), and my obsession with audio reproduction make me ideally suited to deliver this project. </p>
<p>I call it the Leghorn for no other reason than it has a chicken-head knob for the tube select switch and Leghorn is the name of a chicken that reminds me of Saturday mornings growing up with my brother Mark.</p>

<h3><strong>OUR campaign goal</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Minimum campaign funding of just $30,000.00! (</strong>approximately 10 units<strong>)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Orders for these first 10 units will enable us to craft another 90 units for a total limited supply of 100 Leghorn Tube Rolling preamplifiers</li>
<li>Orders for the next 40 units will recover our investment to date</li>
<li>Orders for the last 50 units provide operational funds for the next phase of product development</li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>YOUR goal </strong></h3>
<p><strong>Support a winning campaign for vintage style audio reproduction and tube rolling on the fly!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>For the first time ever it is possible to HEAR THE DIFFERENCE when tube rolling.</p></li>
<li>The Leghorn preamplifier is capable of holding three preamp tubes in a hot and ready state:<ul>
<li>Where one and only one preamp tube is actively processing the audio signal, and</li>
<li>Where you can instantly switch the processing of the audio signal to the adjacent tube and</li>
<li>Where switching is made without interruption, distortion, or overlap in the output signal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A few tube rolling applications of the Leghorn preamplifier: <ul>
<li>MUSICAL PREFERENCES : Ability to hot switch between tubes thought to be better suited to a particular input device or musical genre. I enjoy music of all kinds and I use my own Leghorn to switch between preamp tubes when I listen to Jazz recordings from the 50s vs British Invasion recordings from the 60s. </li>
<li>COMPARE DIFFERENCES: No-hassle no-waiting A/B/C comparison between tubes from different manufacturers or different variants from the same manufacturer helps you squeeze the most performance out of each recording. Getting down to the nitty gritty you can listen to the same song switching between the three tubes to determine the best tube for that song: more bottom end, more top end, better midrange, whatever it takes!</li>
<li>COMPARE SIMILARITIES: Isolate and perform A/B comparison between electrically identical tubes from the same manufacturer to verify there is no audible difference before dropping them into your main power amplifier or another system.</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>We plan to introduce a few features for contributors to vote on during the promotional period so you also get the opportunity to participate in the creative process</li>
<li>And the satisfaction of helping to bring a new product and new business into existence</li>
</ul>
<p>Watch the extended demo, interview, and other videos to learn what is unique about this preamplifier.</p>
<p>Supplies of the premier version of the Leghorn are limited to 100 units so be sure to order your perk today!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will allow GlassCity Amplifiers to be the first to market with this technology. First to market means gaining mind-share which in turn has a huge impact on establishing the company as the first name in tube rolling. Future market share for tube rolling and non-tube rolling audio products requires the Leghorn to deliver exceptional audio reproduction out of the gate so quality is our top priority.</p>
<p>Depending on how successful the campaign is we also hope to invest in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhancing the Leghorn,</li>
<li>Developing the Leghorn Mk II with Arduino </li>
<li>Development of OTL tube rolling headphone amplifier</li>
<li>We also see a huge potential for both live music and the recording industry</li>
</ul>
<p>More about the campaign and the difference your contribution will make:</p>
<ul>
<li>A successful campaign will change tube rolling to a much more objective exercise because the listener can actually HEAR THE DIFFERENCE when switching between tubes</li>
<li>
<i>Success with this Indiegogo campaign opens up the opportunity to create more products with the same patented tube rolling technology</i><ul>
<li>Utility style tube rolling device</li>
<li>Audiophile grade tube rolling headphone amplifier</li>
<li>Full featured preamplifier with multiple inputs -  phono, tape, CD and so on</li>
<li>Wireless version with Bluetooth for digital control and music streaming</li>
<li>Single channel device for live instruments or audio engineering and recording studios</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><h3>Success means the opportunity to compete for a portion of the non-tube rolling market with new non-tube rolling GlassCity Amplifiers products such as a main power amplifier or phono amp</h3></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Supply chain is the biggest risk and biggest unknown. Availability of parts and materials may vary depending on a number of factors. A high percentage of the device is machined from high-quality raw materials that are basically commodities. This should help mitigate risk because we can change vendors or make substitutions. For example, we can get aluminum and steel from more than one source or we could substitute walnut for mahogany if needed. </p>
<p>Other parts like Transformers and Filter Capacitors traditionally have the lowest on-hand inventory with the vendors and if on backorder may require the longer lead times.  In many cases these components can be substituted. The challenge with substitution is fitment which can create more delays than waiting for the backordered item. We will assess and commit to make choices that get you a tube rolling preamplifier in a timely fashion and that also keep us on target financially.</p>
<p>We are taking steps to mitigate risk in other ways. We have enough k40y-9 Russian military grade output capacitors to build ~50 units and are slowly stocking up on other components like potentiometers, RCA jacks and control knobs.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620413315/iag5p2or342nbpsjtvbm.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This product is the creation of a hobbyist with a strong aptitude for repairing vintage audio equipment and for building audio components from kits and from scratch. Electrical engineering and manufacturing are not yet among our core competencies or deep experience here at GCA.</p>
<p>Therefore we are prototyping with our in-house CNC and farming out the manufacture of the chassis and faceplates to a local vendor with decades of manufacturing experience. We may also work with them to deliver the cabinet sides and rear rail. Good partners with experience will help us achieve success. </p>
<p>Lastly is the circuitry itself which, in this application, is the simplest and purest form of the tube rolling preamplifier; uncomplicated by relays and microchips and so many useless features that no single person could use them all. The simple elegance of the circuit is a benefit to you because it processes audio signals extremely well and is uncomplicated by features that can take away from the core function of processing of audio signals.</p>
<p>The simplicity of the circuit is a benefit to GlassCity Amplifiers because less complexity means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fewer parts</li>
<li>Faster to market</li>
<li>Less to test</li>
<li>Less to break</li>
<li>Less expensive to build</li>
<li>Easier to build/Less time to build</li>
<li>Fewer defects </li>
<li>Fewer returns</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620692679/m1yoyzjy2ohcjycrjdop.png"" src=""""/></p>
<div>Simplicity will also streamline the certification process which is presently underway. The implementation of the patent pending tube-rolling technology in this incarnation (the Leghorn) is a throwback in more than just outer styling. I have made a wide survey of audio devices; from mechanical devices of the 1910's through the decades of electrically amplified audio including the 20's, 30's, 40's, 50's 60's, 70's, 80's, up to modern amplifiers and microchip controlled wireless devices.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have owned and operated devices from every decade and in most cases (starting in the 30s through 80s) found a circuit diagram and repaired and replaced broken or aging components no longer up to spec. In the course of my 12 year journey it has become clear to me that improvements in audio reproduction have been made since my 1912 Edison Diamond Disk hit the market! It is also clear that in the decades that follow improvements, tradeoffs are made to reduce cost and expand features.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>GlassCity Amplifiers products are intended as a contemporary look back at slivers in time where the core function of a class of devices (like amplifiers or preamplifiers) took a specific form that delivered a remarkably high level of quality in terms of pure audio reproduction. We are interested in situations where the core function of a class of devices is essentially unchanged but where the evolution in design, component technologies, and manufacturing methods have caused the audio reproduction experience of that class of device to drift over time. Drift to the point where something desirable has been lost. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>So the circuit design is intended to be as optimized as possible to achieve the goal of what makes a tube based preamplifier but with all the convenience and safety of a modern device. In this design there are no microchips or EMF emissions to worry about because all the features are physical or mechanical. From an electrical perspective it should not be much more complicated to certify than a lamp.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The design also incorporates pre-certified components and safety precautions:</div>
<ul>
<li>Chassis mounted three-prong plug receptacle</li>
<li>Detachable three prong plug</li>
<li>Fuse holder &amp; fuse</li>
<li>x/y type safety capacitor</li>
</ul>
<div> </div>
<div>I built the first Leghorn prototype in December 2020. I have been using it for entertainment and demos for months. I move it around a lot too so it's getting heavier than normal use and it is rock solid. I built the Mark II prototype in early February. I have been using that one in my theater for 3 months now without turning it off so while it doesn't move around it has at least 2,000 hours and is also rock solid. </div>
<div> </div>
<p>Both of the first two prototypes are wired point-to-point and hand soldered. Hand building each unit takes more time than outsourcing the manufacture of a printed audio circuit with integrated components such as resistors. Hand building also requires skilled labor. </p>
<p>We have designed and CNC etched a prototype for a small circuit board that is essentially a bank of resistors. The idea is to accelerate assembly and reduce defects by organizing all the resistors on a small circuit board and then hand wiring the rest point-to-point. </p>
<p>There are two final design prototypes in progress. In the month of June we will finish building out both: one with the etched circuit board and one completely point-to-point. If demand is high we will likely move to the resistor bank on a printed circuit board which will initially slow us down. Getting another vendor onboard and through additional prototyping with that vendor will take time and rework but once complete will allow us to scale much more quickly. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help...</h3>
<p>If now is not a good time to contribute with a monetary donation, that is ok! You can still help us by sharing our campaign  to your friends, to any social media platform ( facebook, instagram, twitter, youtube, tumbler, and so on). Tube Rolling is a niche so we need to spread the word far and wide.</p>
<p>If you know anyone that is into or thinking about getting into tube audio please share our campaign directly. Indiegogo makes it easy with their share tools.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and consideration!  </p>

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>We are musicians who are passionate about our guitar tone. Whether we're tweaking knobs on our amp, building pedals, or modifying our guitars, we are always searching for that perfect sound. One thing we have noticed is that with all of the customization options on the market now, there are so few for guitar pickups. We want to provide an experience in pickup buying that will help others on the same ""tone journey"" get the exact tone they are looking for.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We can't get to where we want to be without your help. All contributions to this campaign will be used to help us purchase the supplies and tools we need to get started.</p>
<p>First and foremost, we'll need a 3D printer. In the past, we have worked with outside sources for this, but that is no longer an option if we want to be able to provide the response time and quality we want. Take a look at the printer we're looking at here: <a href=""http://shop.prusa3d.com/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://shop.prusa3d.com/en/</a><br/>If you want your contribution to go directly towards the printer purchase, check out our special perks that will do just that!</p>
<p>After that amount is raised, anything else earned will be used to provide further customization options for our pickups, including pole pieces, magnets, additional pole spacing options, and anything else we (or you) can think of.</p>
<p>If our full goal is reached, we are confident we will be able to fully and quickly develop our new pickup buying and customization experience.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>A new way to find your tone</h3>
<p>With all of the options available to guitar players, we've found one piece of equipment falling behind the rest with new innovation. Pickups have been made in the same way using the same materials and looks for years. Our goal is to combine new and old techniques to make buying new pickups and full immersive, personalized experience rather than a chore.</p>
<p>Combining 3D printing technology with good old fashioned hand winding techniques, we're creating a unique experience of personalization and customization. We want to be able to produce on-demand designs for our pickups, giving you unprecedented control over the look and sound of your purchase. Match the look to your guitar, or make them stand out! It's all in your hands now.</p>

<h3>The reality check section</h3>
<p>We have some lofty goals for the future, but right now we are focusing on creating the best experience we can for you, our supporters. We're going to face some challenges on the way there, though. From setting up and learning to use our 3D printer, to making sure each pickup ends up exactly how you want it, it will all be a learning experience. Our #1 goal is to make sure you are happy. If you're not, let us know! We'll do everything we can to make it right.</p>

</div></div>","Who we are
We are musicians who are passionate about our guitar tone. Whether we're tweaking knobs on our amp, building pedals, or modifying our guitars, we are always searching for that perfect sound. One thing we have noticed is that with all of the customization options on the market now, there are so few for guitar pickups. We want to provide an experience in pickup buying that will help others on the same ""tone journey"" get the exact tone they are looking for.

What We Need
We can't get to where we want to be without your help. All contributions to this campaign will be used to help us purchase the supplies and tools we need to get started.
First and foremost, we'll need a 3D printer. In the past, we have worked with outside sources for this, but that is no longer an option if we want to be able to provide the response time and quality we want. Take a look at the printer we're looking at here: http://shop.prusa3d.com/en/If you want your contribution to go directly towards the printer purchase, check out our special perks that will do just that!
After that amount is raised, anything else earned will be used to provide further customization options for our pickups, including pole pieces, magnets, additional pole spacing options, and anything else we (or you) can think of.
If our full goal is reached, we are confident we will be able to fully and quickly develop our new pickup buying and customization experience.

A new way to find your tone
With all of the options available to guitar players, we've found one piece of equipment falling behind the rest with new innovation. Pickups have been made in the same way using the same materials and looks for years. Our goal is to combine new and old techniques to make buying new pickups and full immersive, personalized experience rather than a chore.
Combining 3D printing technology with good old fashioned hand winding techniques, we're creating a unique experience of personalization and customization. We want to be able to produce on-demand designs for our pickups, giving you unprecedented control over the look and sound of your purchase. Match the look to your guitar, or make them stand out!

You can listen to ultra-high-resolution sound that was not possible with small earphones.
Even very fine and small sounds are clearly reproduced without being buried. Therefore, it is good for hearing protection because it is easy to listen to all sounds at low volume.
 
Magnetic-static method, vibrating membrane is a super-low mass metal thin film with high magnetic permeability.
Magnetic-static method, The moving part of the vibrating membrane is in a physical non-contact
Magnetic-static method, vibrating membrane moves by itself only with the power of pure magnetism. Because there are no parameters that interfere with super-fast manoeuvres other than equivalent mass, elasticity and acoustics and mechanical resistance, a powerful ultra-high resolution acoustic transformation synchronized in real time to very fine or fast complex signal changes is performed.
Magnetic-static method, vibration membrane, is a single path that simultaneously implements vibration and acoustic deformation to eliminate loss, distortion, and delay of multiple pathways, such as dynamic and BA, to provide a very clean and delicate sound.
Magneto-static method, clearly distinguish even minute sounds and greatly increase sound separation.
   
Filter-less 2Way hybrid
A combination of multiple speakers commonly  used in advanced conventional earphones, Replace with a single MSHD speaker, ultra high resolution It is very advantageous for the realization of market generalization of the market.
Bright and clear and detail portrayal of a wide range of high purity sounds
  
MSH DRIVER is used by various sound companies such as Noble-M3, Itsfit-fusion, SHUOER- Tape / Singer, spear labs-triton 1
Their attractive sound tuning technology makes the MSH DRIVER even more brilliant.

</div><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;color: #F44336;"">Can I use this pick on other instruments?</span></p><div>
</div><p><span>Yes, Pickatto will work on any stringed instrument that a </span><span>plectrum can be used on.</span></p><div>
</div><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;color: #F44336;"">Will this pick work for guitarists that pick with their left hand?</span></p><div>
</div><p><span>The “wing” was placed strategically to </span><span>accommodate right-handed players since that covers 90% of guitarists.

</div></div>","Most guitarists agree that their fretting hand is more developed than their picking hand so Pickatto was designed to bring accountability back to the picking hand. When humans can see their efforts in numbers it becomes easier to set and meet goals which is the premise for Pickatto and why it is like a Fitbit for a guitar player.












Last time we checked guitarists use two hands to play.  So why is every training tool and exercise designed for developing the fretting hand?







See how you measure up for the day and know how close you are to hitting your daily and weekly goals.
Why count plucks?  It takes millions and millions of repetitions to develop the picking hand.  The easiest way of measuring huge numbers is simply to count them to have a numerical goal each day(similar to a bracelet that counts steps).  Stephan Curry has a goal to shoot 500 three pointers in practice each day so do you think that is part of the reason he is the best shooter in the NBA?
Why show up and down strokes in percentages?  A new player shouldn't even know what an upstroke is and should be taking 100% down-strokes during the first couple weeks.  The upstrokes are slowly integrated over time and most intermediate and advanced players will fall around 60/40.
Why measure pressure?  The secret to building speed and endurance in the picking hand is with a relaxed hand.  The pressure EXERTED BY THE PLAYER ON THE PICK can show when a player's hand is tensing up and squeezing too hard.  There are also articles about tendinitis being developed over many years of over squeezing the pick so Pickatto can make players aware of this instantly.
""The Speed Challenge"" Requested by many guitarists who have tried the pick.  If you go into the ""red"" which means your picking hand is tensing up, it shuts down the challenge so be aware of this when trying to achieve the gold star.Have you ever noticed that every guitar training tool focuses on improving the fretting hand?  Every feature and design in the software is intended to help make you a better and more consistent player while focusing on making picking hand repetition as perfect as possible.  At the price of 2 or 3 guitar lessons, Pickatto is affordable and worth it for a guitarist of any level to take his or her playing to the next level.
To get from the handmade prototype to the final production model is why we need your help.""If you use Pickatto each time you practice and set tough, but obtainable goals each day this product WILL make your picking hand more consistent and reliable."" - Brad Egler


CEO and inventor, Michael Murawski, demonstrating the first prototype at our booth at the Anaheim NAMM show which is the largest music convention in the world.“I have devoted the last year of my life to this project and believe this will revolutionize how guitarists practice. As a guitar player of 25 years, I know how ambiguous it is to “make sure you practice an hour a day” because each player can accomplish something different during that hour. The new age of learning any instrument is trending toward “quantified musician” technology to make practice time more efficient and goal oriented; Pickatto is right in line with this way of thinking.” - Michael MurawskiThe Pittsburgh Tribune Review - ""The software is really accurate.""NARIP - ""Many incredible inventions were featured throughout the convention but the most innovative was the Pickatto.""InCommunity - Spring 2016 - ""A measure of music""guitarplayer.com - ""But to date no pick has been able to provide guitarists with any data about their playing. Pickatto hopes to change that.""musicradar.com - ""Countless picks come through these hallowed doors - some are designed as learning aids, others claim to revolutionise the plectrum, but the Bluetooth-enabled Pickatto aims to do both.""
Thinnest battery that can be produced
Smallest tech that exists to produce the most practical pick possible
Custom shape to maximize comfort while still housing a USB port.
App is free for iOS and Android devices
Pickatto barely weighs more than your average pick but that is what is great about it. The extra weight is the same concept as a batter warming up in the on deck circle with a weighted ""donut"" on his bat so when he takes it off and approaches the plate the bat feels lighter and easier to swing. 


- Silo Ornelas
Pickatto's first sponsored guitarist- Art MachucaSinger, songwriter, and guitar player.
""As someone who loves to get back to basics to improve skills, like working on the bad wrist break in my golf swing, this pick immediately made me recognize that I hold a guitar pick incorrectly. Just like my natural tensity screws up my golf swing, the death grip I put on the pick became immediately evident through the software""
- Greg Vaslowski‎
Part-time guitar and bass player

""Great tool for anyone looking to improve their overall picking technique.""
- Chad Koza
Guitar player and music store sales associate
""If you understand the importance of having goals to improve at anything in life.... Then you need this pick to become a better player!""

I am not interested in purchasing an item but would like to make a contribution to help see this product succeed.  How do I do that?
At the top of the campaign page there is a ""Back it"" button that you can select and then type in the amount you would like to contribute.  Thank you for your support.
Can I use this pick on other instruments?
Yes, Pickatto will work on any stringed instrument that a plectrum can be used on.
Will this pick work for guitarists that pick with their left hand?
The “wing” was placed strategically to accommodate right-handed players since that covers 90% of guitarists. The pick will work for left-handed players but the shape of the pick might feel a little awkward and it will be up to the player to decide for themselves. We have future plans to produce a limited amount of picks with the wing at the top right of the pick that will be more accommodating to left-handed players.
When will I receive my product?
The T-shirts will ship approximately 5 weeks after the campaign ends.

Much like all other crowdfunding campaigns that average 4-9 months after the campaign ends to receive the product, we are no different. The company that will be producing the final production model estimates total completion in November so this is perfect timing to order a Pickatto as a Christmas gift.

Will my pick wear down? 
Picks inevitably wear down over time but some plastics are much more effective in preventing wear. The polycarbonate plastic we will be using is incredibly hard to wear down and also sounds great against the strings.


What is the money that is raised used on?

Funds are used for a few different things: 



Building the best production model possible with help from the company we trust. 
The first model of state of the art, micro technology is very expensive and that is why WE NEED YOUR HELP to make this happen.

Manufacturing thousands of units to fill all of the orders placed on Indiegogo as well as shipping them. 


Printing enough shirts to fill all of the orders and shipping them. 


The remaining funds going to advertising during the campaign and our U.S. patent application filing since we currently only have a filing date.


What is some additional info on the prototype?
For the person that would like to own a piece of history involving a product that will revolutionize how guitarists develop their picking hand. Two prototypes were used at the 2016 NAMM convention for hundreds of guitarists to test and try out. These signed prototypes will be shipped in November.

What’s the additional info on the Skype session?
We are very excited about this perk. You will be one of the first guitarists to have a Skype session while you can see each others’ Pickatto stats in live time. You can decide on the musical material covered during the 45min session. Silo is an accomplished guitar instructor who lives in California and is Pickatto’s first sponsored guitarist. You can read his bio and see him play at siloguitar.com. Challenge him during your session to the Speed Challenge and take him down!!

<h3>Historic Eco-Timber</h3>
<p>Over a century ago, the Ottawa River was used to float logs downstream as transportation to ship to the world.  Many of these logs  sank during their voyage and have been preserved at the bottom of the river.  These heritage logs are superior to today's timber since they grew hundreds of years ago in ideal light/temperature conditions, causing a tighter annual ring density and stronger/low resonant wood.  Why cut down new forests when we can reclaim these unique pieces of history?<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505150988/qynpxgri9o1bsua1mb6a.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We are passionate about both high-quality audio and our environment.  Founders, Ben Seaman and Scott Rathwell, are both raising families on the beautiful Ottawa river, which has brought them together as good friends and now business partners.  In their spare time they are often found outdoors with their families.</p>
<p>Ben (Electrical/Acoustical) and Scott (Mechanical) combined, offer 30 years of engineering and product management expertise, giving them the ability to drive perfection into their design.  Ben's past design experience on award winning speakers, such as Definitive Technology and Golden Ear flagship speakers has provided him with the skills necessary to produce superior speaker that surpasses acoustic expectations.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506423742/upiitnl12hakqqsuk4vm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We have merged the HIFI sound quality expected by audiophiles and integrated the convenience of bluetooth to create a speaker that people will showcase in their home for years  to come.  Each speaker has a unique stunning grain pattern and will be a statement piece in any surrounding.  We formed Riverwood Acoustics because we demanded a home speaker with serious sound and style..</p>

<p><strong>Funding Target</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>We are using crowdfunding for pre-sales of our home wireless speaker.  Here is our setup and pilot production run costing breakdown.</p>
<ul>
<li>Company production infrastructure setup</li>
<li>Material cost (Premium solid birch River wood)</li>
<li>Assembly cost (Handcrafted in Canada)</li>
<li>Tooling and machining cost</li>
<li>FCC and UL/CSA approvals testing</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Not only will you receive a premium solid wooden wireless speaker but you will help change the world, here is how:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reclaimed River wood creates a solid non-resonance, non-toxic speaker enclosure.</li>
<li>We source our timber from the Ottawa River to minimizes our carbon footprint. We pay a premium price for this wood but when you see and feel its historic grain, you will understand why.</li>
<li>Handcrafted locally in Canada to help generate local jobs.</li>
<li>We partner with <a href=""http://waterrangers.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">WaterRangers.ca</a> to provide funding for youth waterway testing and education, as a way for us to give back to our community.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502021303/bxtxqxbezr9ebz3wzicx.png"" src=""""/>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our biggest program risk is manufacturing our product within proper cost controls.  All the components we used in our design are high-end, causing a high bill of material cost.  We are working with suppliers to buy in volume to minimize impact.</p>
<p>We have already built 6 working prototypes and are confident in our industrial design and sound quality.  Check out our website for independent reviews and more detailed specifications</p>

Over a century ago, the Ottawa River was used to float logs downstream as transportation to ship to the world.  Many of these logs  sank during their voyage and have been preserved at the bottom of the river.  These heritage logs are superior to today's timber since they grew hundreds of years ago in ideal light/temperature conditions, causing a tighter annual ring density and stronger/low resonant wood.  Why cut down new forests when we can reclaim these unique pieces of history?
We are passionate about both high-quality audio and our environment.  Founders, Ben Seaman and Scott Rathwell, are both raising families on the beautiful Ottawa river, which has brought them together as good friends and now business partners.  In their spare time they are often found outdoors with their families.
Ben (Electrical/Acoustical) and Scott (Mechanical) combined, offer 30 years of engineering and product management expertise, giving them the ability to drive perfection into their design.  Ben's past design experience on award winning speakers, such as Definitive Technology and Golden Ear flagship speakers has provided him with the skills necessary to produce superior speaker that surpasses acoustic expectations.

We have merged the HIFI sound quality expected by audiophiles and integrated the convenience of bluetooth to create a speaker that people will showcase in their home for years  to come.  Each speaker has a unique stunning grain pattern and will be a statement piece in any surrounding.  We formed Riverwood Acoustics because we demanded a home speaker with serious sound and style..

Funding Target

We are using crowdfunding for pre-sales of our home wireless speaker.  Here is our setup and pilot production run costing breakdown.

Company production infrastructure setup
Material cost (Premium solid birch River wood)
Assembly cost (Handcrafted in Canada)
Tooling and machining cost
FCC and UL/CSA approvals testing


The Impact
Not only will you receive a premium solid wooden wireless speaker but you will help change the world, here is how:

Reclaimed River wood creates a solid non-resonance, non-toxic speaker enclosure.
We source our timber from the Ottawa River to minimizes our carbon footprint. We pay a premium price for this wood but when you see and feel its historic grain, you will understand why.
Handcrafted locally in Canada to help generate local jobs.
We partner with WaterRangers.ca to provide funding for youth waterway testing and education, as a way for us to give back to our community.



Risks & Challenges
Our biggest program risk is manufacturing our product within proper cost controls.  All the components we used in our design are high-end, causing a high bill of material cost.  We are working with suppliers to buy in volume to minimize impact.
We have already built 6 working prototypes and are confident in our industrial design and sound quality.  Check out our website for independent reviews and more detailed specifications
Please help back this project and own a piece of history.

*A.I = Artificial Intelligence
(Site en français)

Today, receiving information at the right time has become an important standard for saving time. 
That's why we've created an object that predicts all of your daily wishes and that marries your smartphone, connected objects, speakers, and remote for a more intelligent and quicker use. 
With MYShinzo, you have a wide range of features at your fingertips in order to not only indulge your passion for music, among others, but to also, and especially, control your home (a truly smart home).




MYShinzo connects to your speakers to stream music via WiFi.  
It's equipped with high quality WiFi audio streaming in order to update your existing hi-fi setup and speakers.
It syncs music from your smartphone or the Cloud with compatible devices from anywhere in your house.

The music played automatically by MYShinzo will always be your genre of music, and at other times a mix of the musical genres of all the MYShinzo users in the same room.
MYShinzo's artificial intelligence also uses your speakers to communicate vocally with you.


MYShinzo is constantly analyzing TV programs in order to suggest the show that you want at the appropriate time.  
All you need to do is settle down on your couch, the TV will turn on and automatically switch to the channel of your favorite show.

MYShinto boosts your WiFi's power! No more need for your guests to enter codes to connect to Wi-Fi. All you need to do is tell MYShinzo, who can access your setup, and the application will give your guests access when they arrive.



With the help of MYShinzo's multi-sensors, you'll live in a healthier house! It measures the temperature, humidity, and noise for your inner well-being.  
MYShinzo also monitors the weather outside in real time and will let you know before you leave so you can make sure you're wearing suitable clothing (umbrella, coat, etc.). It will also suggest the best method of transportation and can even call an Uber for you.


It's compatible with all connected objects that use the AllJoyn framework and protocols like BACnet or Z-Wave with AllJoyn Device System Bridge (DSB).

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a hybrid designer who are interested in enhacing the ability of people. I am going to graduated from a Double-mastered course about innovation design at Royal College of art and Imperial College London.</p>
<p>This project aims transform people's bodymovement into sound engineering, make the creativity creative.SoundEngineering(SE-1) allows user to making electronic music by body moving. With using several high sensitivity distance sensors and a joystick, the SE-1 could make the process of edit music a better experience. Adding beats, effects are available now. As basing on open source platform, SE-1 allows users to develop it with electronic develop kits.</p>
<p>The SE-1 has three main features now<br/>-Changing the effect of sound and a piece of music<br/>-Adding beats to a music project<br/>Both the features are available in music-making and performance</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The fund will go in to develop the prototype and make it a well-founded product. OEM production, marketing test, branding and the user experience will be developed with the fund. And for the further promotion, there will be also next generation product and different type of product facing to different target customers.</p>
<p>Further Testing and develop--13500 GBP</p>
<p>OEM production--18800 GBP</p>
<p>Marketing Test-- 8000 GBP</p>
<p>Branding --12000 GBP</p>
<p>Other Cost( Material, Oversea post....)--2500 GBP</p>
<p>Total-------54800 GBP</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The perk is a early bird chance to get this innovative piece. The product will sell as 170-220 GBP. If the project do not meet the goal, every one donate over 50 GBP will get a refund by a rate(cause the project may under further development) and a gift related to this project. I hope my project will become a success like the Pocket Operator of Teenage Engineering. While my product will lead the way of creativity and bring the music experience to a new era.</p>
<p>Any ideas and tueorials are welcome, and if you from a professional in sound, engineering and design, welcome to refresh my mind and take the project further.</p>

But technology has changed in 10 years and bone conduction headsets are no longer the only safe listening headset available.  Even though they provided a safe alternative to over the ear headsets, the sound was average and the increase in volume resulted in vibration to the head  Again, our amazing engineers solved the problem. Experimenting with various sound transmission technologies, CL/Alova engineers perfected directional audio in Etude. The results are spectacular: no shocking vibration, excellent full spectrum spatial sound that only you hear (minimal sound leakage).

Our ergonomic engineers spent months examining the open ear form factor on every type of head and ear. Our engineers, in an effort to perfect sound while at the same time designing for ear health,  consulted with medical experts in the hearing industry. Employing AI modeling, our engineers succeeded in creating the perfect design, balanced, light, secure, so comfortable you don’t know you're wearing them.  Because they don’t go in your ears, you eliminate potential hearing loss and wax buildup, have situational awareness, and stellar sound. Our team knows consumers love biking, running, yoga, walking and yes shopping. The last thing we need is to be zoning out on our favorite tunes while crossing the street or when our bosses need us! So from the beginning, Etude was designed to enhance your activity, not block out the world. Open Ear allows the natural sounds around you to be clear, providing a safe listening experience. Whether you are in the office and your boss is asking a question, or you are out on your morning run , Etude combines a health and safe listening experience with amazing hi-fidelity sound. Ten years ago, bone conduction was the new way of listening while staying aware of your surroundings. But technology has changed in 10 years and bone conduction headsets are no longer the only safe listening headset available.  Even though they provided a safe alternative to over the ear headsets, the sound was average and the increase in volume resulted in vibration to the head  Again, our amazing engineers solved the problem. Experimenting with various sound transmission technologies, CL/Alova engineers perfected directional audio in Etude. The results are spectacular: no shocking vibration, excellent full spectrum spatial sound that only you hear (minimal sound leakage). With Etude, our team has created a listening experience like being at a live concert. It is music the way the artist intended it to be heard. If we were going to design  the best Open-Ear headset ever made, our engineers told us that we had to put the best components inside. CL/Alova engineers equipped Etude with the very best Bluetooth Sound Chip, Qualcomm QCC3040 employing APTX high-fidelity sound protocol combined with our exclusive cashmere speakers for the best open ear sound. Our connection is Bluetooth 5.2, providing exceptional connectivity, speed, and stability. Walk away from your phone and you are still connected and talking (up to 33 feet).  Play video games without lag. Etude delivers every time. Phone calls never sounded better than with Etude. Utilizing the most advanced dual beamform noise reduction mic components and technology, Etude Open-Ear Headsets deliver crystal-clear calls and high-definition voice recognition for accurate voice commands. So clear,  your friends will think you are in a library, instead of the train station! All while you remain aware of your surroundings.  We weren’t satisfied with just your phones voice assistant. Sure, Etude TWS Headsets will call up “Hey Alexa”, “Hey Siri”, “Hey Google” with a quick tap. But we asked our engineering team for more and they delivered. Etude comes with an app powered by “Native Voice.” Native voice not only calls up your phones voice assistant but opens and controls numerous apps on your phone. Next time you want a latte, just let Native Voice open your Starbucks App. Etude truly lets you leave your phone in your pocket. Alova's and Conduction Labs engineering team optimized power consumption to deliver exceptional battery life. Etude Open-Ear Sports Headsets deliver up to 8 hours of continuous use on one charge. That is enough power to run a marathon twice or fly from London to New York!  Even better, with its included travel case that can be wirelessly charged (or USB C) you can get up to 24 hours of use and more than two months of standby time. So get out and run that marathon or travel the world, Etude will keep you connected. Etude was molded to follow the natural curve of your ear. Even with your extreme motion, they wont fall out like other TWS earbuds do.  The fear of the lost earbud is gone.  Exercise to your hearts content - Etude will stay with you.     Conduction Labs was started in January of 2020 with the goal of offering consumers high quality, feature rich, open ear headphone solutions at a highly competitive price delivering great value.

Continue to live an uneasy life in a busy and noisy environment? Put on the earbuds and increase the volume to cover the noise? Pay Attention! That will cause double damage to the auditory sense system! Now you only need active noise reduction and passive noise reduction as well as convenient equipment to help you reduce or eliminate noise by pre-setting ANC algorithms and noise to generate inverse waveforms corresponding to noise, thereby reducing the energy burden of the auditory system.ELFMIC Nursear X ANC headphones feature active noise cancelling and high fidelity, you will feel a gentle and calm environment. keep quiet, and easily listen to world sounds. Present, there are two noise processing: active noise cancelling and passive noise reduction. With the development of technology, from itself of the noise, the mics are used to monitor the noise, and the circuit chipsets generate the reverse sound wave (180° out-of-phase wave),  then which is played through the speakers, that produces an ""anti-noise wave"" to eliminate the environmental noise. Today more and more people understand and easily accept the noise reduction effect brought by active noise reduction (ANC).ELFMIC Nursear headphones adopt more flexible and efficient way to specially customized  ANC digital software algorithm and hardware integrated technology, that includes the advanced chipsets, high-quality materials, alone audio cavities,  omnidirectional monitoring mics with suitable position, senior played speakers and acoustic theory etc.ELFMIC headsets have two mics in each ear cup to monitoring the noise including Feedforward and Feedback. It provides the best noise-free experience in both ambient and background sources compared to most active noise cancelling (ANC) headphones that use only one microphone to pick up and process ambient noise.    The monitoring mics are used to collect ambient noise. Generate “anti-noise” through advanced the chipsets and algorithms of ANC  and adaptive filter, neutralize these noises and send the processed signal to the speaker for playing. So that you can have a quiet enjoyment.   One earphone, two modes, more surprises！Customized 40mm Titanium diaphragm speaker, professional Jiahe tuning master adjustment, audio shocks your auditory nerve.When ANC onWhen you need a quiet environment to enjoy your holiday or lifetime, turn on the ANC mode, it eliminates ambient noise in two seconds, experience better audio, and listen to better beats.When ANC offWhen there is no noise from the surrounding environment, you can turn off the ANC to save power and enjoy a longer time. It won't prevent you from listening to any beat details you want to hear.Follow your own rhythm and choose what you like！  The cover ear cover is 100° rotatable for easy storage and carrying or sport. It is equipped with magnetic charging cable. The terminal is inserted into the charging interface of the earphone, which can be blindly charged, that is more convenient.Integrated One-piece metal molding ear-cup, durable retractable structure, delicate and soft ear cotton and TC90 head bow compatible with most head types, that is more comfortable.Support Bluetooth wireless input and wired AUX input for easy application in different scenarios, that is more useful.Follow your own rhythm and choose what you like!  Brushed metal buttons and levers, flick and start, arbitrarily controlledFlick the lever to cut over the noisy world.

</div></div>","A NEW WAY TO CREATE MUSICAL IDEAS
We are very proud to launch OXI ONE to the world, an intuitive and rewarding way of driving both, your inspiration and gear with a remarkable selection of powerful functionalities, all at your disposal, all at a glance.

Expressiveness and robustness have remained at the forefront while many of the shortcomings and oversights found in other hardware sequencers have been avoided.
 
TRULY INSPIRING

Finally, a sequencer that can provide all of the breakthroughs you’ve been searching for! Whether you’re striking new creative ideas via the randomizer, experimenting with exotic scales, building and tweaking arpeggios over your patterns, or harmonizing an entire song… creative new inspiration is never more than an arms length away with the OXI ONE. DAW users, hardware enthusiasts, and all those in between can rejoice the same, we’ve kept everybody in mind while creating this dense array of compositional tools. Bridging connectivity gaps in the studio and on the stage has never been easier
 
COMMAND THE SHOW

Between the numerous connectivity options, the large number of flexible tracks at your disposal, the robust and thoughtful user interface, and the modulation and randomization capabilities that OXI ONE provides, we are more than confident that it will perfectly match any kind of rig and become the centerpiece of your professional live performance.

 
MODULAR INTEGRATION

Modular enthusiasts, OXI ONE has come to stay. Seamless integration between a performative sequencer and Control Voltage like never before.

Modulation routing, any degree of polyphony support, envelopes… open the cv layout and instantly select/configure what you need in every precise moment with fluid assignations of all the outputs. It has never been so easy yet so flexible and powerful.

 
COMMUNITY DRIVEN

We have been working on OXI ONE for over 2 years to make one of the most powerful sequencers and MIDI controllers on the market. With constant feedback from the community, we have integrated a lot of advanced, attractive and requested functionalities.
Because OXI ONE is designed by musicians for musicians. With your help, OXI ONE will be possible!
 

 

FEATURE OVERVIEW
If there is one thing that sets OXI One apart, it is the wealth of advanced features, here are some of the main ones:
 


4 FULLY configurable sequencers.
4 MODES AVAILABLE PER SEQUENCER and more to come.
Up to 32 tracks.
Up to 128 steps per sequencer.
Full featured performing keyboard with dedicated layouts.
Song/Arranger mode with dedicated interface and pattern launch option.
Chord mode with +150 chord variations and intelligent HARMONIZER mode.
4 LFOs, routable to internal parameters, MIDI, and voltage control.
4 Loopers.
4 arpeggiators with multiple independent modes, octave, gate, and division.
8 cvs, 8 gates and 1 Cv input fully configurable and routable.
32 CC's RECording.
Solid and compact build. Battery powered.
Intelligent pattern randomizer.

 


 

WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY & PORTABILITY
 
Cables? The less the merrier. OXI One has central and peripheral Bluetooth which allows it to easily connect to any device. MIDI Bluetooth is very versatile, allowing to wirelessly control and synchronize devices with very low latency and dead steady clock on far from ideal scenarios.To make it even better, One incorporates a rechargeable battery which makes it a very portable and versatile tool that allows us to use it anywhere.But what if I like cables? No problem, OXI One can be used either through the BLE or with a USB cable.
What does “central” exactly means?
Central means that OXI One becomes a hub for all your MIDI Bluetooth needs. You can throw in any MIDI Bluetooth keyboards, controllers and sensors to control and record directly on OXI One.It also can act as peripheral Bluetooth device to connect to DAWs, mobile or desktop apps and the other way around. To release affordable Bluetooth enabled controllers and wearables is on our sight. 

 

UP TO 4 MODES AVAILABLE PER SEQUENCER
Let’s talk a bit more about the current modes available to choose from. You can choose 4 in any combination you want to better fit your setup and needs:
 
MULTI
8 tracks with totally independent parameters: start-end steps, length, division, etc. Configurable MIDI outputs and scale note filtering. Did you miss having more tracks?, now you can unlock up to 32 tracks in the OXI ONE.
 
CHORD
Innovative chord function generation for easy creation of chord progressions. Amazing palette of chords types and voicings which perfectly matches to each other. It comes with a handful dedicated chord menu.  
MONO
Full control of a monophonic track with complete visualization of the melody. Never get lost again in a pattern!  
POLY
Total freedom up to 7 voices, 4 CC’s and plenty parameters per step. Forget your DAW piano roll for a moment and enjoy this new creative editing experience.

 
More modes will come in future Firmware Updates: Cartesian, Melodic Steps, Curve…

 


MUSIC THEORY AT YOUR FINGERTIPS
Our innovative CHORD MODE allows you to easily create chord progressions with plenty chord types, voicings, spread and bass options and specific chord menus. The chords can be easily arpeggiated with the built in chord arpeggiator. With 150+ chord variations!
 

 
 
With HARMONIZER MODE you can sequence other instruments to harmonically play with your chord progressions.
 

 
 
We could make an entire product only around these features but you can enjoy them integrated with other awesome tools.

 

MAKE, EDIT AND IMPROVE YOUR MELODIES AND PATTERNS
Algorithmic pattern randomizer with humanization, variation control, density control, scale and root randomization. With these few controls you will be surprised about the results, tweak the parameters and get a killer musical idea in seconds.

Give continuous variations to your patterns with the multiple randomization options: velocity, octave, triggering probability, gate, ratcheting and step skipping randomization .
The built in LFOs sthe CV input and the multiple routing options, route to internal parameters like gate, velocity, note, bend, time division, etc, to MIDI external parameters like CC’s and the control voltage outputs.
A modern sequencer should have modern edition tools, not only have we not skimped on them but we have added some quite novel ones. Duplicate, rotate, move, reorder, humanize, undo several times, extend, copy and paste steps, tracks and transform sequencers from one mode to another. Independent init and end steps and time division per sequencer and per track.
Different modes of recording (loop, one shoot, extend), with or without quantization.
Pattern management with 15 projects and 16 patterns per sequencer which makes a total of 960 patterns.
Project contains information about the CV&Gates configuration, arrangement and songs.

 

DEEP CONTROL OF YOUR MODULAR RACK
With 8 configurable and assignable CV outputs and 8 gates, including VCA ready dynamic envelopes, glide, vibrato, lfos and modulation outputs, you have plenty of possibilities for your Modular system. Polyphonic support at any level, configure as many voices or tracks as you need from each of the sequencers.

 

With “trig envelopes” MIDI and cv goes hand by hand, a dynamic modulation source VCA/LPG ready: AD envelope with velocity as amplitude and gate as decay time by default. They can be routed to any of the other modulation lanes.
MIDI (trs, usb, Bluetooth) to cv and vice versa, the behaviour is configurable from the dedicated CV Gate layout. The Cvs respond to the configured MIDI channels of every sequencer.
LFO and MOD offset and inversion controls.
With MOD on, you can record the movement of the encoders to create looping modulation.
Sequencer: Select which sequencer affects the corresponding output and easily turn on/off the output.
The grid adds another layer of performance: turn on/off and change cv sources on real time.
Select the source of modulation or voice/track for any output.



 

SONG MODE WITH ARRANGEMENT VIEW AND CLIP LAUNCHING
We wanted to take the traditional song modes and pattern chaining available in existing sequencers to the next level.

 

4 lanes of pattern playback, one per sequencer
Full pattern progress view on the screen with countdown for next pattern change
Clip launch to manually change patterns
Save up to 16 Songs per Project
Program Change send to control external gear
Color code the same patterns for visual recall

 


 

FULLY FEATURED KEYBOARD MODE
In addition to the workflow that it brings us as a sequencer, OXI ONE incorporates 4 piano layouts with advanced functionalities and shortcuts, specifically designed for each mode:


Full 8 octave range
Pitch bend, pressure, modulation and velocity direct knob controls
Note filtering by color. Explore new scales.
Arpeggiator for every track with 10 currently available modes, hold, octavation and selectable clock division.
Roll function with 8 different divisions
Choose and musically play chords from the palette. There’s no need for uncomfortable chord assignments, the right chords are instantly available for the selected scale with plenty of chord types, voicings and variations.
These chords can be arpeggiated as well by turning the arpeggiator on
Special functions like mute, solo, arm record depending on the configured sequencer mode.

ONE gives you everything you need to improvise new ideas and unleash your imagination, no matter what is your setup or musical genres.
 

 

OXI SPLIT SPECIAL ADDON!

We wanted OXI One to be compact and slender. Implementing MIDI TRS ports has had a big role reducing its weight and volume substantially.
OXI Split comes as an efficient and inexpensive solution for users that want to control more equipment through DIN connections, providing one MIDI DIN Input and two MIDI DIN Outputs, doubling the data transfer capacity and the number of MIDI channels up to 32. With OXI Split, users can chain more hardware instruments reliably.
