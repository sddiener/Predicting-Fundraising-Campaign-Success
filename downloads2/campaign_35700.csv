The Vision
My dream is to combine the creative, expressive and healing arts in exciting new ways:

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>CIACAC was formed when Neuza Nacimiento, a mother of a pre-adolecent boy, became discouraged with the social opportunities available for young people living in the Jardim Berdim Mar favela where they live.  At the time, the neighborhood was experiencing a particularly insecure and violent period due to clashes between rival narco-trafficking groups. Baile Funk parties were the only place where local youth could meet, and Neuza worried this environment was not a healthy one for young people.  She wanted them to have the opportunity to see the world outside of the favela.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In 2001, Neuza put together a group of 8 local children.  The purpose of this group was to go on excursions to universities, theatres, beaches: anywhere where the children could get out of the favela and experience some of the treasures of Rio de Janeiro (many of which were unknown and inaccessible to the children, despite having lived there their whole lives).  Neuza, who is a writer, says, ""I became a writer because I saw someoe writing and that showed me that it is possible.  I thought that smelling the air of the university would help generate an ambition in the children for something different than what they could see in the favela."" The group was called ""A Look into Other Things"", and it was the seed of what has today become CIACAC.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>CIACAC is now registered in Brazil as a non-governmental organization.  It recieves a constant flow of local and foreign volunteers, and offers an ongoing program of classes for children and adolescents ranging in topic from Guitar to English to Capoeira.  Despite this measurable growth and success, CIACAC is still a very small, very grass-roots organization essentially run by Neuza alone in her own house. She first funded the organization with the money she earned working in houses in the wealthy South Zone of the city (Neuza started in this line of work when she was 8 years old). Ever since her money ran out, CIACAC has been funded by sporadic donations from volunteers. This money is not reliable, and Neuza has been looking for ways to make CIACAC self-sustainable.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In 2011, a group of 8 volunteers from Spain came to do a month-long project with CIACAC.  They stayed in a room at Neuza's neighbor's house, and recieved breakfast and lunch.  Neuza thought, ""Why not build an addition to my own house where volunteers can stay? They can pay a small amount for room and board and this will generate some income, enough to keep CIACAC going."" With a few generous donations and international fund-raising efforts, Neuza was able to begin the addition.  She has added a new level to her house where 8 volunteers will be able to sleep, cook, and bathe. As I write this, the construction nears completion.  But much work remains: cementing the block walls, finishing the floors, painting everything, instaling electricity, and all of the unpredictable variables that come up with such a project. CIACAC has run out of money.  Neuza estimates that the project needs another $6,000 to reach completion, at which point she can open the doors of her already very open house.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>CIACAC has run for the last 10 years on anything is could get. Volunteers come and go (but many who spend time here remain committed after they have left Rio); money comes from bursts of generocity on the part of individuals; used clothes show up sometimes from a youth hostel in Copacabana.  CIACAC has recieved furniture from a generous company called Lorinvest, and computers from a Spanish organization called IPC Pandora. It's incredible how much has been accomplished and how many people around the world have connected to this project. Still, CIACAC lacks any kind of security.  The only constants are Neuza and the children.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Building the hostel addition to her house will free Neuza from a bit of this insecurity.  It will allow CIACAC's international volunteer program to generate an income that will sustain the project as a whole.  In the meantime, volunteers will be better organized and closer to the community in which they work.  The volunteer hostel is a solution that makes good use of what already exists.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div>CIACAC is looking for $6,000.  This sum is an estimate, and we hope it will cover the expenses that remain on finishing the extension. This job has already been started and is, in fact, very near to completion.  What remains to be done?  Well, we need to pay the workers.  We need to finish the celings, and the floors of the bedroom and kitchen.  The windows and doors need to be intalled, as does electricity. On the roof, we have to erect a wall so that volunteers can hang out up there and enjoy the breeze (and maybe grill a little Brazilian <i>churrasco</i>!). It would be nice to be able to paint the walls, too (I've already volunteered to do this work, we just need the paint). And then, there are the random things that come up.  An extra bag of cement here, a PVC pipe there.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We <i>will</i> raise this money because we have to. But if we could raise it now, with IndieGoGo, CIACAC could start hosting volunteers that much sooner.  The sooner CIACAC can start accommodating the volunteers who are already inquiring about arrival dates in March, April, May...the sooner CIACAC can start taking advantage of having a degree of stability.</div>

But if we could raise it now, with IndieGoGo, CIACAC could start hosting volunteers that much sooner.  The sooner CIACAC can start accommodating the volunteers who are already inquiring about arrival dates in March, April, May...the sooner CIACAC can start taking advantage of having a degree of stability.

<h3>What is BiSHoP?</h3>
<p>My name is Caroline Calderon. I am the Outreach Coordinator for the Bill Sorro Housing Program (BiSHoP), which is a program of the Veterans Equity Center, a non-profit initially established to serve Filipino World War II Veterans, many of whom reside in the South of Market (SoMa). BiSHoP was formed to address the housing needs of the SoMa community. We currently serve a vast target population that includes adults living with disabilties, formerly incarcerated individuals, families, seniors, immigrants, members of the LGBT community, veterans, and South of Market residents and workers.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What's the cause?</h3>
<p>BiSHoP is currently in the process of building our internship program. We will be training students, community advocates, and individuals from all walks of life on housing issues that the South of Market community faces. Interns will be assisting SOMA residents and workers in applying for affordable housing opportunities in San Francisco. I hope that through this internship, interns will work alongside community members and help address and outline the needs of the community.</p>
<p> </p>

<div>
<h3>How will your donation benefit the cause?</h3>
<p>Our internship is just starting! So we definitely need the funds to kickstart it off right. Your monies will help put food on the table during our meetings, pay for intern supplies and necessities (office supplies, travel expenses, etc.), fund future community outreach events that will be organized by our interns, and most importantly, your donation will help build the foundation and resources that our internship needs to make an impact in the community.</p>

</div></div>","My Story
Hi there,
I'm Bram van Leuken and I'm 24 years old. I'm a Dutch student at the Academy for Popculture of the Hanze institute in Leeuwarden, Netherlands. This page will contain my mandatory internship for my bachelor degree. 

After months of negotiating, my internship at Duck Down Music is secured. My internship will take place from november 1st 2011 till march 31th 2012 in Manhattan, New York City! 


The Impact

For a Dutch student, this kind of internship is exceptional and a beautiful opportunity to gain knowledge and experience in the city where everything can happen. 

This is an once in a lifetime opportunity to experience the way of life in New York and to have inside intelligence in the music branche. The knowledge, experience and wisdom I gain are very valuable. Inside intelligence in the music branche of the United States and, especially New York, are so helpful to build a strong surface for myself to share that knowledge and wisdom in the Netherlands. I want to stimulate the music branche in the Netherlands and Europe to create new opportunities and concepts to fill the gap. It's not only for me, it's for a greater good!

Motivation and devotion are the keywords to describe my characteristics to succeed in everything I do and love. For me, this opportunity to intern at such a prominent organisation in the music branche in the United States is truly a blessing.


What We Need & What You Get
No organisation nor foundation in the Netherlands will/can support me financial so I have to apply for a loan, since I haven't got the required amount of money.

I've worked long days the last couple of months, but an internship for five months in New York requires a lot of money including: flightticket, visa application, housing, public transport, insurance and necessities.  
The overall prices for groceries in New York are more expensive than the prices in the Netherlands. 

Here is a financial overview for my internship for five months:

- $900,-      Flight-ticket 
- $1.525,-    Visa application + Basic medical insurance
- $3.500,-    Housing
- $3.375,-    Primary necessities
- $375,-      Public transport
- $85,-        Travel insurance
- $80,-        Supplementary insurance
- $200,-     Third Party Insurance

[EDIT! Had a stroke of luck!!]
I've earned around $7.500 My overall (primary) expenses are calculated around $10,000. This means I have to gather around $2,500 to realize my internship without a loan. 

My entire goal is to cover all the expenses, of course. But as you may understand, every cent is a blessing. If I don't reach my entire goal, every dollar I've gained has a positive effect on the budget.

I will keep you up to date with a blog regarding my internship, experiences, adventures and crazyness during my stay in New York. If you support me, I'll give you a shoutout in my blog or post links to your music, if you're a musician. It's all about spreading the word out for the benefit of all! If you live in the New York area, I'll give you a beer, if my budget allows it ;-)

<p>As a graduate student of Drama Therapy and Mental Health Counseling in Seattle, Washington, I see theatre and the expressive arts as powerful tools in healing individuals suffering from grief and trauma, empowering people to transform their lives, and in inspiring people to create a socially just and environmentally sustainable world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In June 2011, I have the opportunity to join drama therapists and fellow students in urban and village settings in Kenya and Uganda, where we will exchange knowledge and techniques with African theatre practitioners, counselors, social workers, and other group leaders who help heal and transform their communities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Using applied theatre and drama therapy methods, our work with community leaders will focus on several outcomes:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<div>In Nairobi, Kenya, working with the Amani People's Theatre (<a href=""http://www.aptkenya.org"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><u><font color=""#004276"">www.aptkenya.org</font></u></a>), we will focus on street children in remand homes</div>
</li></ul><p> </p>
<ul><li>
<div>In Budondo village, Uganda, working with the Atua Theatre Troupe, we will focus on women’s reproductive health</div>
</li></ul><p> </p>
<ul><li>
<div>In the Great Rift Valley in northern Kenya, and villages near the coast of the Indian Ocean, we will focus on  preventing election-related violence</div>
</li></ul><p> </p>
<ul><li>
<div>In Northern Uganda, we will focus on rehabilitating and healing trauma in child soldiers after 20 years of war.</div>
</li></ul><p><br/>Prior to going to Kenya and Uganda, I will receive intensive training from the leadership for this service adventure. Debriefing and reflection sessions after each phase of the work will utilize theatre, movement and somatic practices.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 11pt;"">The mission of those who I will be joining is to find the bridges between personal exploration and service to humanity. The leaders will use their expertise in Theatre of the Oppressed, Developmental Transformations, Playback Theatre, Psychodrama/ Sociodrama, Contact Improvisation and Authentic Movement. </span></p>

<h3>Hello friends of Greenhornets baseball!</h3>
<p>It's hard to believe spring is almost here!  You know what that means? BASEBALL! </p>
<p>For boys in the 3rd and 4th grade, generally 9 years old and under, the Greenhornets program offers an opportunity to play baseball at a level higher than traditional 'club' baseball.  This is referred to as 9U Travel baseball.  This is a team comprised of 12 boys who were selected by the coaching staff following two days of intense tryouts involving 30 plus boys in the fall of 2012.   These boys should be congratulated for their hard work and achievement. </p>
<p>Severna Park baseball, like most sports in the area, is played almost year round when you consider spring baseball, fall ball and winter workouts.  The Boys 9U travel team started playing together in the fall of 2012.  This winter they worked on baseball skills indoors.  Now they are ready to move outside for some real baseball practice before the season begins in March 2013. </p>
<p>It's a long season requiring a huge commitment of time and money from everyone involved.  100% of your donation, less a minimal fee charged by Indiegogo, will go towards costs of equipment, uniforms, league fees, tournament fees, umpire fees, travel costs, etc.</p>
<p>Typical costs range from $400 to $600 per boy for the season.  Our goal is to raise $2,000 or close to it by the mid April 2013.  We thank you for your consideration.  Please share this website with friends and family you feel may want to contribute.  You can do this by sending them a link to this website or using the Indiegogo Share Tools.  Don't forget to check out the nice perks we are offering for your generous donation!</p>

<p>The Churchville-Chili community was stunned this week when we learned of the sudden and tragic loss of a man that shaped nearly every student he encountered in his 20+ years of teaching at Churchville-Chili High School.  Rob Coats, ""Mr. Coats"",  connected with all students, regardless of their backgrounds and beliefs.  One student recalled that 20 years ago, Mr. Coats was able to quell ""teen angst "" and showed students that ""there was a place in the world for odd balls and weirdos.""  Ultimately, Rob made a lasting impact on everyone he met.  As his Facebook is flooded with messages of disbelief, the class of 1994 (one of Rob's first) and others have called for a Memorial Fund to devote to causes that embody Rob's commitment to education and acceptance.  We plan on looking at options to set up a Robert P. Coats Scholarship fund and talk to his wife and family about which charities best represent his personal mission.  I am starting with a goal of $47,000 which represents $1,000 for each year Mr. Coats was on this earth.  All money that is received will be donated to a scholarship in Rob's name, causes that his family believes represent his ideals, and/or his family.  Rest in Peace Mr. Coats.  Though you are gone, you and your legacy of encouraging independent thought and expression will not be forgotten.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<br/><p>
<span style="""">Since opening its doors in spring of 2010, the <a href=""http://www.afghanistannationalinstituteofmusic.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span style=""color: rgb(14, 22, 248);"">Afghanistan National Institute of Music</span></a> (ANIM)
has been working to rebuild the social and cultural life of Afghanistan by
providing a safe, tuition-free, and musically rich learning environment for the
children of Kabul and its surrounding villages.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0.1pt 0in;""><span style=""""><br/></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0.1pt 0in;""><span style="""">I traveled to Kabul last winter
as a guest artist of ANIM’s Winter Academy. I led a small delegation of
musicians from Boston’s New England Conservatory, where I am Assistant Chair of
the Department of Contemporary Improvisation. Eden MacAdam-Somer, Larry Unger and I were struck by the vitality,
enthusiasm, accomplishment and musical appetite of ANIM’s students. We were
struck, too, by the dedication of ANIM’s Afghan and international faculty who
work tirelessly towards their students’ future.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0.1pt 0in;""><br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0.1pt 0in;"">I will be returning to Kabul from August 1 - 15 to offer private lessons, and to help <span style="""">prepare advanced students to step into teaching
roles. </span></p><p></p><p></p>
<br/><span style=""""><p></p></span>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style="""">Music has been subject to extreme censorship in Afghanistan.
Under the Taliban rule, singing and dancing were prohibited, musical
instruments were confiscated and destroyed, and professional musicians were
forced into silence or exile. The consequences of musical censorship for the
Afghan people, culture and heritage have been profound and far-reaching. Much
progress has been made since the Taliban were deposed in 2001, but Afghanistan
faces many challenges as it rebuilds a shattered political, economic and social
infrastructure.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""""><br/></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""""></span><span style="""">Under the direction of founder Dr. Ahmad Sarmast, the
Afghanistan National Institute off Music provides a safe, tuition-free learning
environment for students regardless of gender, ethnicity or social class. Half
of the school’s students are drawn from Afghanistan’s population of orphans and
child laborers: these students receive both academic and musical training. The
families of child labourers receive a monthly stipend roughly equal to the
child’s monthly earnings. Just $30 keeps a child in school instead of working
the streets.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><br/><span style=""""></span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Guest artists can play a vital role in ANIM's mission. 


<span style="""">Here are a few ways my residency will make a valuable contribution:</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""""><br/></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="""">As in any school, guest artists generate excitement.  Students get inspired
and pay attention. </span><span style="""">I will work alongside ANIM's faculty to give private lessons and coach small groups but I will also contribute my own expertise in jazz and rock styles, improvisation and cross-cultural collaboration.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""""></span><span style=""""></span><span style=""""><span style=""""></span></span><span style="""">ANIM’s faculty is
dedicated, working long hours in artistic as well as administrative 
roles. My residency will provide a break in a teacher's busy schedule, adding new pedagogical and artistic
perspectives and allowing ANIM's faculty to attend to other areas of professional and institutional development.<br/></span>
</li>
<li><span style="""">Travel to Afghanistan can pose a logistical and financial challenge to
potential guest artists; one of the goals of my visits to ANIM is to create a culture of
international engagement at NEC and carve a pathway for my extended community
of students and colleagues to engage in this type of work, at ANIM and beyond.<p></p></span></li>
</ul>
<br/><span style=""""><p></p></span>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style="""">The New England Conservatory is sponsoring the cost of my
travel to Kabul, and I am donating my time and services to ANIM. Now, I am
raising funds cover my costs for 15 days on the ground. The cost of a secure
guest house, meals and local transportation comes to about $100/day, so my
first funding target is $1500. I’ll be traveling to Kabul whether or not I make
this goal. </span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""""></span></p><p> </p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style="""">I would also like to raise funds to sponsor the education
for at least of ANIM’s students. An annual stipend of $360 keeps a child in
school and off the streets. So, my goal in all is $1860. Any surplus funds will
go to endow additional scholarships.<br/></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><br/><span style=""""></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style="""">Every little bit helps, so I do hope you'll contribute. I’ve concocted some little rewards to
thank you for your generosity. Please look them over and give as generously as you can. Thank you.</span></p><p></p><p></p>

</div></div>","Our Story

Since opening its doors in spring of 2010, the Afghanistan National Institute of Music (ANIM)
has been working to rebuild the social and cultural life of Afghanistan by
providing a safe, tuition-free, and musically rich learning environment for the
children of Kabul and its surrounding villages.

I traveled to Kabul last winter
as a guest artist of ANIM’s Winter Academy. I led a small delegation of
musicians from Boston’s New England Conservatory, where I am Assistant Chair of
the Department of Contemporary Improvisation. Eden MacAdam-Somer, Larry Unger and I were struck by the vitality,
enthusiasm, accomplishment and musical appetite of ANIM’s students. We were
struck, too, by the dedication of ANIM’s Afghan and international faculty who
work tirelessly towards their students’ future.

I will be returning to Kabul from August 1 - 15 to offer private lessons, and to help prepare advanced students to step into teaching
roles. 


The Impact
Music has been subject to extreme censorship in Afghanistan.
Under the Taliban rule, singing and dancing were prohibited, musical
instruments were confiscated and destroyed, and professional musicians were
forced into silence or exile. The consequences of musical censorship for the
Afghan people, culture and heritage have been profound and far-reaching. Much
progress has been made since the Taliban were deposed in 2001, but Afghanistan
faces many challenges as it rebuilds a shattered political, economic and social
infrastructure.

Under the direction of founder Dr. Ahmad Sarmast, the
Afghanistan National Institute off Music provides a safe, tuition-free learning
environment for students regardless of gender, ethnicity or social class. Half
of the school’s students are drawn from Afghanistan’s population of orphans and
child laborers: these students receive both academic and musical training. The
families of child labourers receive a monthly stipend roughly equal to the
child’s monthly earnings. Just $30 keeps a child in school instead of working
the streets.

Guest artists can play a vital role in ANIM's mission. 


Here are a few ways my residency will make a valuable contribution:



As in any school, guest artists generate excitement.  Students get inspired
and pay attention. I will work alongside ANIM's faculty to give private lessons and coach small groups but I will also contribute my own expertise in jazz and rock styles, improvisation and cross-cultural collaboration.


ANIM’s faculty is
dedicated, working long hours in artistic as well as administrative 
roles. My residency will provide a break in a teacher's busy schedule, adding new pedagogical and artistic
perspectives and allowing ANIM's faculty to attend to other areas of professional and institutional development.

Travel to Afghanistan can pose a logistical and financial challenge to
potential guest artists; one of the goals of my visits to ANIM is to create a culture of
international engagement at NEC and carve a pathway for my extended community
of students and colleagues to engage in this type of work, at ANIM and beyond.



What We Need & What You Get
The New England Conservatory is sponsoring the cost of my
travel to Kabul, and I am donating my time and services to ANIM. Now, I am
raising funds cover my costs for 15 days on the ground. The cost of a secure
guest house, meals and local transportation comes to about $100/day, so my
first funding target is $1500. I’ll be traveling to Kabul whether or not I make
this goal. 
 
I would also like to raise funds to sponsor the education
for at least of ANIM’s students. An annual stipend of $360 keeps a child in
school and off the streets. So, my goal in all is $1860. Any surplus funds will
go to endow additional scholarships.



Every little bit helps, so I do hope you'll contribute. I’ve concocted some little rewards to
thank you for your generosity. Please look them over and give as generously as you can. Thank you.

</div></div>","Our Story
       New Planet Media Studio tells stories that affect us all about environmental issues that mainstream media doesn't cover. By  crafting riveting scripts and revealing video, the Studio team is able to inspire people to take actions that make a real difference.
      Albert Einstein said, “we can’t solve problems by using the same
kind of thinking we used when we created them.” Our ways of doing business
limit our ability to live sustainably. Yet we can’t throw out our economy nor
pretend our limited resources will support us.  We need new ideas to
develop new ways of working. New Planet Media Studio covers stories on
sustainability issues that impact society, business, finance and nature around
the world. Through video, educational story lines, research, statistics and
compelling presentation of all sides of the issue, our stories drive people to
act.
       Stories reveal the ripple effect of how small actions create big
reactions that affect all manner of people regardless of location, economic
standing or political stripe. From the inspirational to the educational to the
alarming, we aim to educate those who want to make a difference. By exposing
people to engaging perspectives we catalyze opportunities with new ideas,
models and success stories we never learn about from mainstream media. 
The Impact
 
New Planet Media Studio
co-founder Leigh Badgley's film ""Making a Stand"" about a Greenpeace Argentina's
campaign to stop the de-forestation of an ancient forest reserve in Argentina that was destroying the home of the Wichi indigenous people, helped attract so much publicity that, the President of Argentina submitted to the pressure and called a moratorium on any further
encroachment or de-forestation. 
 
What We Need & What You Get
     We would like to raise funds to produce our first video product.
The first project of New Planet Media Studio is an educational video series
entitled ""Whole Earth Dialogue"" that shows kids and adults that
before you make changes, it's better to understand how the world works first. Then the series presents useful pragmatic action steps.
There are two parts to the series, a 6 video starter project and the remainder
of 24 videos to complete the 30 video set.
      In 30 three minute video presentations, Rex Weyler (journalist,
econolist, Greenpeace International co-founder and author teams ups with Jon
Cooksey, award-winning filmmaker, screen writer of the world's funniest global
warming film ""How to Boil a Frog"", to explain society's environmental
challenge by showing how the world really works. 
     By using real story telling, not lectures, using images, music,
feelings and real people, Weyler and Cooksey will establish the series'
foundation to describe the systems, ecology, economics, time, human experience,
and genuine solutions that are often at odds with nature. What does it really
mean to achieve sustainability? In the opening of the series the viewer will
join in the search for the very elements of great solutions that are not
available from the mainstream media or our education system. Supporting
material will link viewers to critical information. The filmmakers also meet
and interview some of the top thinkers and visionaries in these topics who are
putting vital new ideas to work. They are the people we never get to hear about
who are leading the charge for true sustainability.
Project Budget
   This project has two parts. The full project is 30 videos. The
first part has 6 three minute videos. The second part completes the 30 video
series and provides funding for promotion.
    These six videos comprise a Summary of Human habitation in an
Ecological world. The introductory videos reveal the essentials of Ecology,
Economy, Time, Growth, Feelings, and Solutions. Part two covers the Solutions,
People & Politics, Systems & Ecology, Ecological Economics, Nature of
Energy, Eco-Psychology - or how environmental trauma effects us all. Part two
then profiles ecology's visionaries; people like John Stuart Mill, the first
Ecological Economist, Albert Bartlett on the Math of Growth, Kathy McMahon on
Peak Oil, and Anita Burke discussing sustainability inside the oil company
boardroom.
 
 Individual 3-minute video segments, with graphics and
production costs: $3,300 to $6,700 each
 == Full Budget Total: $240,000
      Thirty 3-minute videos: $180,000 - $195,000
      90-minutes of film in 3-minute
user-friendly bite-sized, entertaining, Internet videos.
      plus launch promotion budget,
social networking, website: $45,000.
== Typical 3-minute video Production budget: The Video budgets
vary. Some costs are well below commercial production standards due to support
from film industry colleagues, volunteer technicians, and services offered at
low cost, made available by Producer Jon Cooksey. All video projects will range
in cost between the two scenarios presented in the budget: $3,350 to $6,750.

<p><em>""Literary </em><em>education must follow the education of the hand —the one gift that distinguishes man from </em><em>beast.” - Mahatma Gandhi</em></p>
<h2>UPDATE (12/13/12): </h2>
We've been completely overwhelmed with gratitude for the amazing response we've received in less than 48 hours! I'm speechless. THANK YOU! As we surpass our goal, let's keep this campaign going! With additional funding, we will purchase the following materials to expand our technological resources and to open the cultural lab to a music education workshop program, with the help and support from mentors in the U.S. and India who will help us in developing a curriculum: </div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>an electronic keyboard, CD player, speaker set (approx. $150)</li>
<li>Indian instruments: a sitar, tambura, and tabla (approx. $150)</li>
<li>a computer for the lab to use with the projector (used: approx. $100; new: approx. $200)</li>
<li>music education teacher training (approx. $100)</li>
<li>music books and CDs (approx. $100)</li>
<li>funding for postage costs for an art pen pal exchange program with an international school (approx. $80 for one year for four standards)</li>
<li>any additional funding will be allocated for art and music teacher training program for new teachers in future years, the museum/gallery visit fund, and more library books! </li>
</ul>
<p>THANK YOU from the bottom of our hearts for your support! We will continue to send updates! Happy Holidays! </p>
<p>--</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2><strong>THE SITUATION</strong></h2>
<p>While art education programs may be struggling to survive across the U.S., they are almost nonexistent in the low-income education sector in Hyderabad, India. Here at Alliance International, a low-cost private school that serves students from underprivileged families, we are trying to change that. Recognizing that every child deserves access to books and art classes to foster creativity, develop critical thinking skills, and explore the world beyond classroom walls, we want to provide all 1,300 students at Alliance with a multipurpose cultural laboratory that will serve as an art classroom, library, and reading space for years to come.</p>
<p>My name is Kelsey Coates, I am an IDEX Fellow in Social Enterprise, and I serve as the manager of the new Alliance Art Education Program (AAEP). This past year, we have initiated art classes to students through school-wide workshops, competitions, and an empathy-based art curriculum that I designed for students from 5th-8th standards. While these projects have been well received by students, the current classrooms at Alliance are too cramped for art classes. In most rooms, four students sit on one bench, leaving little space for girls and boys to paint, sculpt, and draw openly and comfortably. Also, without a projector, art textbooks, or a color printer, we have been unable to show art works to students for inspiration and discussion purposes. </p>
<p>The school would like to increase its outreach by providing regular, weekly art classes to students from 1st - 9th standards during study hours next year. I am currently in the process of training teachers in art education and have facilitated a partnership with the Hyderabad-based Daira Center for Arts and Culture to seek programmatic support. I am also arranging a mentorship program with a high-income private school in Hyderabad to establish a working relationship between trained art teachers and new AAEP teachers at Alliance.</p>
<p>The school is also in need of a library and reading space. Last year, management at Alliance procured 400 books through Pratham Books (<a href=""http://prathambooks.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://prathambooks.org/</a>), but without a reserved library space, students have been unable to use them as much as they would like.</p>
<p>The new cultural laboratory will address all of these needs. As manager of the AAEP, I will ensure programmatic sustainability by training and guiding teachers and school management in using the lab regularly while keeping normal class times. We aim to build the lab in mid- to late February to begin using the lab as soon as possible and to officially launch new programming in July 2013. </p>
<h2><strong>WHAT WE NEED</strong></h2>
<p>Alliance has reserved a large classroom that it will devote to the cultural laboratory, but we need assistance in furnishing the space and purchasing books and art supplies. More specifically, we are requesting donations for the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>a projector to display art works that will serve as inspiration to students during art lessons </li>
<li>6 foldable tables and 30 chairs that give students space to draw, sculpt, paint, and create</li>
<li>bookshelves to house the new library collection, with a slidable plastic covering to protect books during art classes</li>
<li>approx. 1,000 books, to be purchased from local vendors and education service providers, at roughly 50 cents each</li>
<li>librarian training in implementing reading logs, assessing student reading levels, and assigning reading activities</li>
<li>beanbags and colorful foam flooring to make the room a comfortable reading space when not in use as an art classroom</li>
<li>a sink (with construction costs), for students to wash hands and art supplies in between classes</li>
<li>laminated art posters to provide additional inspiration</li>
<li>solar powered lighting fixtures to provide ample light during regular power outages</li>
<li>additional art supplies not provided by students: clay, paints, paintbrushes</li>
<li>remaining funds will go to a Museum/Gallery Visit Fund, so Alliance can take students on field trips to see local art outside of Golconda</li>
</ul>
<p>The estimated total of these supplies is $1,500. Books will be purchased from the following Indian vendors, in addition to local shops: </p>
<ul>
<li>National Book Trust  <a href=""http://www.nbtindia.gov.in/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.nbtindia.gov.in/</a>
</li>
<li>Children’s Book Trust  <a href=""http://www.childrensbooktrust.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.childrensbooktrust.com/</a>
</li>
<li>Cambridge University Press  <a href=""http://cambridgeindia.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://cambridgeindia.org/</a>
</li>
<li>Tulika Books  <a href=""http://www.tulikabooks.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.tulikabooks.com/</a>
</li>
<li>Sterling Books <a href=""http://www.sterlingbookhouse.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.sterlingbookhouse.com/</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As previously noted, the Children's Gallery at the Daira Center for Arts and Culture in Hyderabad (<a rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/DairaGallery</a>) has graciously agreed to provide support to Alliance as the school launches the AAEP. Daira will guide Alliance art teachers in lesson planning in addition to sponsoring workshop events and gallery showings for the students. </p>
<h2><strong>THE IMPACT </strong></h2>
<p>Alliance is a student-focused institution and currently directs the bulk of its disposable funds to the Mother Sogra Educational Trust (MSET), a student scholarship fund. School fees are low, ranging from approximately $6 - $11 a month per student, to ensure that the school addresses the low-income community in Golconda, Hyderabad.  Although the school operates with a progressive approach to technology and cultural education, the school administration cannot finance additional building projects at this time. </p>
<p>Alliance maintains a standard of excellence in the community and is expanding to 1,600 students in the next year. By contributing to this project, you will have the opportunity to contribute to both the welfare of Alliance students in the underserved Golconda communtiy as well as the overall <a href=""http://www.openideo.com/open/how-might-we-increase-the-availability-of-affordable-learning-tools-educational-for-children-in-the-developing-world/gallery/aps-info.pdf/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Affordable Private School</a> (APS) movement that is thriving in Hyderabad and beyond as a model for education development. </p>
<h2><strong>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</strong></h2>
<p>Every small donation is greatly appreciated and will leave a life-long impact on students at Alliance International. Please share this campaign with family and friends via email, Facebook, or Twitter. </p>
<p>If you would also like to donate to the student scholarship fund at Alliance, please contact me via email at <a href=""mailto:kelsey.coates@idexfellows.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">kelsey.coates@idexfellows.com</a> and I will send you more information. </p>
<p>Thank you so much for all of your support! I will update all of you as the project comes to fruition! </p>

Indian instruments: a sitar, tambura, and tabla (approx. $150)
a computer for the lab to use with the projector (used: approx. $100; new: approx. $200)
music education teacher training (approx. $100)
music books and CDs (approx. $100)
funding for postage costs for an art pen pal exchange program with an international school (approx. $80 for one year for four standards)
any additional funding will be allocated for art and music teacher training program for new teachers in future years, the museum/gallery visit fund, and more library books! 

THANK YOU from the bottom of our hearts for your support! We will continue to send updates! Happy Holidays!

THE SITUATION
While art education programs may be struggling to survive across the U.S., they are almost nonexistent in the low-income education sector in Hyderabad, India. Here at Alliance International, a low-cost private school that serves students from underprivileged families, we are trying to change that. Recognizing that every child deserves access to books and art classes to foster creativity, develop critical thinking skills, and explore the world beyond classroom walls, we want to provide all 1,300 students at Alliance with a multipurpose cultural laboratory that will serve as an art classroom, library, and reading space for years to come.
My name is Kelsey Coates, I am an IDEX Fellow in Social Enterprise, and I serve as the manager of the new Alliance Art Education Program (AAEP). This past year, we have initiated art classes to students through school-wide workshops, competitions, and an empathy-based art curriculum that I designed for students from 5th-8th standards. While these projects have been well received by students, the current classrooms at Alliance are too cramped for art classes. In most rooms, four students sit on one bench, leaving little space for girls and boys to paint, sculpt, and draw openly and comfortably. Also, without a projector, art textbooks, or a color printer, we have been unable to show art works to students for inspiration and discussion purposes. 
The school would like to increase its outreach by providing regular, weekly art classes to students from 1st - 9th standards during study hours next year. I am currently in the process of training teachers in art education and have facilitated a partnership with the Hyderabad-based Daira Center for Arts and Culture to seek programmatic support. I am also arranging a mentorship program with a high-income private school in Hyderabad to establish a working relationship between trained art teachers and new AAEP teachers at Alliance.
The school is also in need of a library and reading space. Last year, management at Alliance procured 400 books through Pratham Books (http://prathambooks.org/), but without a reserved library space, students have been unable to use them as much as they would like.
The new cultural laboratory will address all of these needs. As manager of the AAEP, I will ensure programmatic sustainability by training and guiding teachers and school management in using the lab regularly while keeping normal class times. We aim to build the lab in mid- to late February to begin using the lab as soon as possible and to officially launch new programming in July 2013. 
WHAT WE NEED
Alliance has reserved a large classroom that it will devote to the cultural laboratory, but we need assistance in furnishing the space and purchasing books and art supplies. More specifically, we are requesting donations for the following: 

a projector to display art works that will serve as inspiration to students during art lessons 
6 foldable tables and 30 chairs that give students space to draw, sculpt, paint, and create
bookshelves to house the new library collection, with a slidable plastic covering to protect books during art classes
approx. 1,000 books, to be purchased from local vendors and education service providers, at roughly 50 cents each
librarian training in implementing reading logs, assessing student reading levels, and assigning reading activities
beanbags and colorful foam flooring to make the room a comfortable reading space when not in use as an art classroom
a sink (with construction costs), for students to wash hands and art supplies in between classes
laminated art posters to provide additional inspiration
solar powered lighting fixtures to provide ample light during regular power outages
additional art supplies not provided by students: clay, paints, paintbrushes
remaining funds will go to a Museum/Gallery Visit Fund, so Alliance can take students on field trips to see local art outside of Golconda

The estimated total of these supplies is $1,500. Books will be purchased from the following Indian vendors, in addition to local shops: 

National Book Trust  http://www.nbtindia.gov.in/

Children’s Book Trust  http://www.childrensbooktrust.com/

Cambridge University Press  http://cambridgeindia.org/

Tulika Books  http://www.tulikabooks.com/

Sterling Books http://www.sterlingbookhouse.com/


As previously noted, the Children's Gallery at the Daira Center for Arts and Culture in Hyderabad (https://www.facebook.com/DairaGallery) has graciously agreed to provide support to Alliance as the school launches the AAEP. Daira will guide Alliance art teachers in lesson planning in addition to sponsoring workshop events and gallery showings for the students. 
THE IMPACT 
Alliance is a student-focused institution and currently directs the bulk of its disposable funds to the Mother Sogra Educational Trust (MSET), a student scholarship fund. School fees are low, ranging from approximately $6 - $11 a month per student, to ensure that the school addresses the low-income community in Golconda, Hyderabad.  Although the school operates with a progressive approach to technology and cultural education, the school administration cannot finance additional building projects at this time. 
Alliance maintains a standard of excellence in the community and is expanding to 1,600 students in the next year. By contributing to this project, you will have the opportunity to contribute to both the welfare of Alliance students in the underserved Golconda communtiy as well as the overall Affordable Private School (APS) movement that is thriving in Hyderabad and beyond as a model for education development. 
OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP
Every small donation is greatly appreciated and will leave a life-long impact on students at Alliance International. Please share this campaign with family and friends via email, Facebook, or Twitter. 
If you would also like to donate to the student scholarship fund at Alliance, please contact me via email at kelsey.coates@idexfellows.com and I will send you more information. 
Thank you so much for all of your support! I will update all of you as the project comes to fruition!

<p>I am organizing costume clinics for kids for Halloween this year.  I am seeking donations of used costume pieces and costume tools (i.e. sewing machines) that will be distributed to community centers throughout New Orleans.  With the support of staff and volunteers, children will learn to recycle, alter or build their own costume using these donations.  My  mission is to teach kids new skills and give them the opportunity to be creative with their costumes.<br/>-- We have identified key neighborhoods in New Orleans and engaged community centers to become locations for our costume clinics.  We are working closely with the Freret Neighborhood Center, the Junior League, and Neighborhood Housing Serivces to coordinate these efforts.</p>
<p>-- We are currently campaigning for donated costumes, sewing supplies, accessories and other costume items from regional theaters,  rental houses, costume supply and industry wholesalers from around the nation.  They can  ship us their donations using our account with UPS or on their own accord. Because we are already relying on their generosity to give us their costumes and supplies, we can not assume they also will want to pay to ship to us. </p>

<h2><span>A tragedy is unfolding before us. While school enrolment is rising in India, education standards are falling — girls especially are disproportionately dropping out from school. </span></h2>
<h2>Help us put more girls from disadvantaged backgrounds into quality schools.</h2>
<p>We believe educating girls is the necessary first step a family can take to emerge from poverty.</p>
<p>We also want to shift the emphasis towards quality of education.</p>
<p>Many educational non-profits in India already do great work. We work with them to put girls not just through school, but through good, low-cost private schools near their homes.</p>
<p>Gyanada Foundation is a new NGO based in Singapore. We do not run schools, far less build them ourselves.</p>
<p>We partner with, and support, these existing non-profits on the ground in India — next to those slums where the full benefit of a rising economy has not reached.</p>
<p>We work in Ranchi, Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>For as little as US$149, or $12.50 a month, you'll get to put one girl through quality private schooling in Delhi, Mumbai, Ranchi or Kolkata.</p>
<p>In the academic year beginning April 2013, we'll put 150 girls through school — half of this we'll try to raise here, the other half we'll try to raise from private donors in Singapore and the US.</p>
<ul>
<li>For $149 a year, put 1 girl from a disadvantaged background in India through a whole year of school</li>
<li>Get updated on her academic progress</li>
<li>For $49, support our Right to Quality Education For the Girl Child campaign, run by us and our partner organizations so we can advocate to improve on existing Right to Education laws to ensure gender equity and teacher accountability</li>
<li>Support as many girls as you can! You can choose to support 5 girls a year for US$699, or less than $12 a month, or enter any amount you prefer</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if we don't hit our target of $8500, we'll use everything we raise to support as many girls as we can.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How We'll Do This</h3>
<p>We help these organisations select disadvantaged local girls, and send them to private schools in the area. Poor parents want their girls to go to these schools and not “free” state schools because many government teachers do not turn up, and when they do — they produce the same or worse student outcomes. But many parents are so poor that they cannot send all their children to these low-cost private schools – and often end up sending only their boys.</p>
<p>We want to humbly extend a small but helping hand to these families. Help us do that.</p>
<p>We'll keep you in our Indiegogo donors' mailing lists so we can update you on how we're doing, how the funds are being disbursed, and let you know how the girl you've supported is doing academically through the school year. </p>

<p><strong>iTribe</strong> is simple and effective in it's purpose. The power of the English language will remove barriers of social mobility the indigenous hill tribes of northern Thailand face. The program also grants access to information technology which will facilitate self-determined village development.</p>
<p><strong>iTribe's</strong> mission is not only English landuage education but also to combat the socio-economic inequalities faced by the hill tribe demographic by expanding the way villagers view possibilities for themselves and their communities. Our multicultural team and the hill tribe communities we support believe strongly in the potential of language and technology but more importantly we understand that a reciprocal exchange of knowledge and ideas is integral to our program’s success and widespread social coordination.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>$500 </strong>pays for 1 iPad</p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>We believe that every student deserves to interact with the learning process peacefully and exempt from judgment. The project therefore necessitates 1 iPad for each student so that they may engage with tablet technology and educational apps. independently and without external distraction.</li>
</ul>
</ul><h3>BIG PICTURE</h3>
<p>Without <strong>iTribe</strong> hill tribe individuals living in the village have to seek education outside the village, especially past primary school. This courage and aspiration for education is rewarded with long travel times, discrimination and limited employment options. The opportunities that are available to hill tribe members are not accurate representations of this group’s incredible untapped potential. Its time village members were imbued with the confidence to realize their capabilities and given the tools to do great things for themselves, their communities, their country and the world.</p>
<p><span style="""">No one deserves to be left behind so <strong>iTribe</strong> seeks not only to bring this group out of the periphery of society and bridge the digital divide but also strives to change the paradigm of how education is provided to hill tribes. Hill tribe members no longer have to leave the village to get a quality education because we are bringing education to the village in order to help these communities realize their own power, strength and potential.</span></p>

To deliver the power of the English language to the most remote villages utilyzing tablet pcs, whiteboards, pencils and teachers. iTribe's credo is not only to educate but also to give students the confidence, creativity and leadership skills necessary to create their own legacy in an ever changing high tech English speaking world.
iTribe is simple and effective in it's purpose. The power of the English language will remove barriers of social mobility the indigenous hill tribes of northern Thailand face. The program also grants access to information technology which will facilitate self-determined village development.
iTribe's mission is not only English landuage education but also to combat the socio-economic inequalities faced by the hill tribe demographic by expanding the way villagers view possibilities for themselves and their communities. Our multicultural team and the hill tribe communities we support believe strongly in the potential of language and technology but more importantly we understand that a reciprocal exchange of knowledge and ideas is integral to our program’s success and widespread social coordination.
 
WHAT YOUR $ DOES …
$12,000 will fund iTribe in the village of Mae Jok for 3 months

ANY CONTRIBUTION



IS IMPORTANT TO US! In Thailand a little goes a long way and any donation is meaningful, necessary and effectively moves us closer to our goal of producing powerful individuals who are able to help themselves and their communities



$50 pays for teaching supplies

This money goes towards whiteboards, mats, markers, pencils, paper etc. and all the supplies necessary for volunteer teachers to effectively run informal classrooms in the jungle



$100 pays for iPad accessories


Military Spec. cases are necessary given the nature of our outdoor classrooms where dirt, mud and weather are all uncontrollable variables. We also rely heavily on headphones to create privacy in the learning process and minimize external noise from cowbells and chickens.





$200 pays for a 3 day village visit


We use this time to run classes using traditional teaching alongside technology and run informal tech sessions with villagers. Additionally, we rely on the community for food, accommodation and support so this money stimulates the local village economy and provides security for the communities that grant us the privilege to work with them.




$500 pays for 1 iPad


We believe that every student deserves to interact with the learning process peacefully and exempt from judgment. The project therefore necessitates 1 iPad for each student so that they may engage with tablet technology and educational apps. independently and without external distraction.

BIG PICTURE
Without iTribe hill tribe individuals living in the village have to seek education outside the village, especially past primary school. This courage and aspiration for education is rewarded with long travel times, discrimination and limited employment options. The opportunities that are available to hill tribe members are not accurate representations of this group’s incredible untapped potential. Its time village members were imbued with the confidence to realize their capabilities and given the tools to do great things for themselves, their communities, their country and the world.
No one deserves to be left behind so iTribe seeks not only to bring this group out of the periphery of society and bridge the digital divide but also strives to change the paradigm of how education is provided to hill tribes. Hill tribe members no longer have to leave the village to get a quality education because we are bringing education to the village in order to help these communities realize their own power, strength and potential.
WE LOVE SUPPORT

<h3>About Me</h3>
<ul>
<li>My name is Megan O'Gara. I am currently a senior at Plymouth State University, snuggled up in the White Mountains, affectionately known as ""New Hampshire's Playground."" I grew up in New Hampshire, originally from Lebanon, and am in love with the Granite State. I am finishing up my degree in early childhood education, with a focus in teacher certification for grades K-3. I am deeply passionate about the importance of primary education, and hope to continue my studies in the field. </li>
<li>For me, continuing my education will mean several things. The most important of which will be the ability to expand my knowledge. I have an interest in researching race and ethnicity conflicts in the early childhood classroom, advocacy issues for families from unique cultural backgrounds, and the importance of early education on the federal level, connecting political science and the topic of early childhood. </li>
<li>Contributors to my campaign will help me achieve my goal of being a professional, intelligent, passionate, and informed leader in education. The first step to this goal is to master the Graduate Requirement Exam and apply to schools. </li>

<p>The goal of the Festival of Conscious Parenting is <strong>to share the awareness practices of the world’s spiritual traditions so that kids can grow up more emotionally healthy, resilient and whole</strong>, and less traumatized than the vast majority of adults.  <strong>We seek to make the world a better place, one moment with one child at a time.</strong> </p>
<h2>The Festival Plan <span style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">  </span>
</h2>
<p><strong>The Festival will feature teachers and practitioners of diverse spiritual traditions, with inspiring and informative lectures, panels, rituals, break-out groups, and various activities</strong>.  It will take place June 20-22, 2014 at the Sonoma Country Day School campus, which includes the Jackson Theater, in Santa Rosa, California.  Friday evening and Saturday will be for adults; Sunday will bring the whole family together with activities for both children and adults. </p>
<h2>What is Conscious Parenting?</h2>
<p><strong>Conscious parenting is the process by which adults grow ever more effective at maintaining nurturing, loving contexts <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">consistently</span> for all the children in their lives.</strong>  All of us have the experience of intending to act with love and generosity, only to find ourselves unconsciously expressing the fears and traumas that shaped us.  If we can stop “the sins of the fathers” from being passed onto the next generation, how could the world be healed?  How much healing can we create? Note that conscious parenting is not just for those currently raising children, but for ALL adults who interact with children, including grandparents, family, educators, friends, etc. </p>
<h2>The Opportunity of Conscious Parenting</h2>
<p><strong>The Festival seeks to share techniques, ideas and inspiration that will celebrate and reinforce EVERY instance when we might have judged a child by some harsh external standard, and instead offer love, nurturance and guidance without an unconscious agenda</strong>. Thus conscious parenting is an opportunity to create happiness for all; it is not yet another expectation of perfection from adults, which would only compound suffering.  Moreover, as we adults become more consistently, lovingly present for children, we will be empowered to treat one another with love and respect too.</p>
<h2>Help Our Volunteers Create the Festival!</h2>
<p>We need your help to make the Festival a reality!  There is no paid staff; <strong>the project is entirely created and supported by volunteers from many spiritual traditions</strong>.  Check out the Festival website at <a href=""http://www.festivalofconsciousparenting.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.festivalofconsciousparenting.org</a> to find out more about who we are, and more about what the Festival will offer. </p>

<p><strong>Who We Are</strong></p>
<p>Bay Area Mutual Aid (BAMA) is a a group of social workers committed to fighting for social justice in our communities, workplaces and society at large, by organizing and mobilizing social workers, supporting each other, and collaborating with other professionals, clients, and community stakeholders.  We apply a broad definition to the title “social worker” and seek to engage all those doing social work in its many forms. We believe that social change and social justice are integral to all forms of social work and hope to reinvigorate our field’s commitment to and understanding of “social change and social justice.” Instead of looking away from abuses of power, we seek to apply a critical understanding of power, privilege and oppression to our work.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>On Saturday April 20th, 2013 BAMA will be hosting a dynamic, interdisciplinary, participatory forum focused on the idea of ""Reimagining Social Work"". We are expecting a crowd of 40-50 participants. We are seeking contributions to support the operating costs for the event including space rental, supplies, and food. BAMA is a volunteer-run organization and the forum will be open to all members of the community free of charge. By supporting this effort, you are supporting the growth and development of a critical, social justice-oriented movement within the social work community in the Bay Area. </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>

</div></div>","Who We Are
Bay Area Mutual Aid (BAMA) is a a group of social workers committed to fighting for social justice in our communities, workplaces and society at large, by organizing and mobilizing social workers, supporting each other, and collaborating with other professionals, clients, and community stakeholders.  We apply a broad definition to the title “social worker” and seek to engage all those doing social work in its many forms. We believe that social change and social justice are integral to all forms of social work and hope to reinvigorate our field’s commitment to and understanding of “social change and social justice.” Instead of looking away from abuses of power, we seek to apply a critical understanding of power, privilege and oppression to our work.
What We Need & What You Get
On Saturday April 20th, 2013 BAMA will be hosting a dynamic, interdisciplinary, participatory forum focused on the idea of ""Reimagining Social Work"". We are expecting a crowd of 40-50 participants. We are seeking contributions to support the operating costs for the event including space rental, supplies, and food. BAMA is a volunteer-run organization and the forum will be open to all members of the community free of charge. By supporting this effort, you are supporting the growth and development of a critical, social justice-oriented movement within the social work community in the Bay Area. 
The Impact
While the NASW - CA Chapter and other mainstream social work organizations across the country are lobbying to protect the social work title and narrow the definition of who is a ""social worker"", BAMA is calling for a dialogue about how we can expand the definition and the practice of social work in our communities.  Through the sharing of critical histories and a collective process of visioning led by community leaders, this forum is an opportunity for folks to gather, discuss and develop alternatives to the more narrow, problematic, mainstream definitions of social work.

<h2>Heart of a Student</h2>

<p>Walter and Wagner now have the incredible opportunity to return to Brazil with the Heart of a Student Message and show those in the very same shoes they were in, that there are other options in life. Society does not have to dictate your path. Nothing is Impossible.</p>

<p>There are over 6 million living in Rio de Janiero Brazil. For those living in the favelas, gun shots and drugs are commonplace. Growing up in poverty makes the drug trade appear incredibly enticing. Families struggle to put food on the table and the older kids of the neighborhood offer a fast thousand dollars, how could they say no?</p>
<p>The Heart of a Student Team is looking to change this outlook. We need to raise $26,400 to speak to over <strong>22,000 Brazilian students</strong> (~$1/kid) over the course of five months from August - January.  [Certified Non-Profit]</p>
<h3><strong>What if we don't raise our goal?</strong></h3>
<p><strong><br/></strong>Any lives impacted make a difference. We budgeted out this campaign to be as cost effective as possible without putting an unrealistic time frame associated with the project.

<h3><strong>What if we raise more than our goal?</strong></h3>
<p>Because we will be operating on a limited stay in Brazil, funds raised above our goal will go towards funding the <strong>Heart of a Student: Heartland</strong> tour in the Midwest January 2014! We will then be able to give students college access all over the Midwest United States! We will close out Iowa then move to Minnesota, Illinois, Wisconisn, Nebraska and Missouri!

</p><p>I am a doctoral candidate
(Doctor of Business Administration) at Northcentral University, and anticipate
beginning my doctoral research this September. While I have sufficient funding
for tuition and fees, I will be incurring unanticipated expenses related to my
research study. <br/></p><p>My doctoral dissertation is entitled “Examining the
Impact of Workplace Spirituality on Turnover Intention in the Food Service
Industry”. Employee
turnover in the restaurant industry is the highest of any U.S. industry (estimates
range from 80% to over 100% annually). Employee turnover is difficult to
measure until it has already happened, but turnover “intention” can be easily
measured with a short survey. <u><b>Workplace
spirituality</b></u>, or spirit at work, is a culture wherein an organization
encourages meaning at work, connection with others, and a sense of community
while at work. It is<u> NOT</u> religious in nature, and many
organizations are not even aware that they promote this culture or atmosphere.
Workplace spirituality
has been demonstrated to produce positive benefits for both employers and
employees, through increased productivity, reduced absenteeism, and reduced
voluntary employee turnover. </p>
<p>My research study will
examine the impact of workplace spirituality on employee turnover intention in
the restaurant industry. Research study participants will be placed in two
groups: a control group and an experimental group. Both groups will complete a
survey at the beginning and the end of a ten-week period, about the level of
workplace spirituality at their place of employment and their intent to look
for employment. Survey responses would remain confidential and anonymous. The
experimental group will participate in a series of four one-hour presentations
covering the topic of workplace spirituality and the benefits for both employer
and employee. The goal of my research is to determine if the
implementation of a workplace spirituality intervention program impacts
turnover intention among employees in food service organizations, and also between
restaurant locations.</p>
<p>I will conduct my research with employees in multiple
restaurant locations of a national chain whose identity will remain anonymous. In
order to ensure a sufficient number of participants in each group, I will be
compensating each participant $10 cash for each survey completed, and for each

<br/></div>","I am a doctoral candidate
(Doctor of Business Administration) at Northcentral University, and anticipate
beginning my doctoral research this September. While I have sufficient funding
for tuition and fees, I will be incurring unanticipated expenses related to my
research study. My doctoral dissertation is entitled “Examining the
Impact of Workplace Spirituality on Turnover Intention in the Food Service
Industry”. Employee
turnover in the restaurant industry is the highest of any U.S. industry (estimates
range from 80% to over 100% annually). Employee turnover is difficult to
measure until it has already happened, but turnover “intention” can be easily
measured with a short survey. Workplace
spirituality, or spirit at work, is a culture wherein an organization
encourages meaning at work, connection with others, and a sense of community
while at work. It is NOT religious in nature, and many
organizations are not even aware that they promote this culture or atmosphere.
Workplace spirituality
has been demonstrated to produce positive benefits for both employers and
employees, through increased productivity, reduced absenteeism, and reduced
voluntary employee turnover. 
My research study will
examine the impact of workplace spirituality on employee turnover intention in
the restaurant industry. Research study participants will be placed in two
groups: a control group and an experimental group. Both groups will complete a
survey at the beginning and the end of a ten-week period, about the level of
workplace spirituality at their place of employment and their intent to look
for employment. Survey responses would remain confidential and anonymous. The
experimental group will participate in a series of four one-hour presentations
covering the topic of workplace spirituality and the benefits for both employer
and employee. The goal of my research is to determine if the
implementation of a workplace spirituality intervention program impacts
turnover intention among employees in food service organizations, and also between
restaurant locations.
I will conduct my research with employees in multiple
restaurant locations of a national chain whose identity will remain anonymous. In
order to ensure a sufficient number of participants in each group, I will be
compensating each participant $10 cash for each survey completed, and for each
presentation attended. 
My crowdfunding campaign goal is $4,000 based upon
the following:
50 participants in control group X $10 per survey X two
surveys = $1,000
50 participants in experimental group X $10 per survey X two
surveys = $1,000
50 participants in experimental group X $10 per presentation
X four presentations = $2,000
(The
above amounts do not include travel and printing expenses which I am prepared
to cover).  
In

complete my research regardless of whether or not I am successful in this
fundraising campaign. The proceeds received by this crowdfunding campaign will reduce
the amount of additional debt which I will incur in the completion of my
degree.NOTE: In order to prevent conflict of interest, any funds received from food service organizations, or employees or principals of the food service organization that is the subject of this study will be returned.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

School safety.   Big priority.  One school director asked for a secure front gate.  Nothing worse than having stray dogs, chickens or even livestock wander into a classroom!

So why $1,500?
Purchased in bulk, $3 per student could buy 500 students (300 in Nicaragua and another 200 in Honduras) and their teachers the basic tools they need for a successful school year.

  Risks & Challenges The terrible risk we run is that children will not come to school at all.  An attitude of inertia and hopelessness will zap the life out of these children before they've ever had a chance.  


The cycle of poverty continues.  A child who stays home endures a bleak existence.  Faced with zero options for the future and nothing to lose, many parents have sent their children to the United States to look for a better life.

</p><p>In 2009 I left
an abusive, long-term relationship; I was allowed to take the furniture I had
brought with me 9 years earlier, my car (with its $20,000 loan attached), my
clothes, my 16 year old cat, and my disability pension.</p>
<p>I was lost and
alone; I had no family and very few friends, and a serious case of depression
that saw me fighting the lure of suicide every day.</p>
<p>After scouring
the local newspapers, real estate web sites, and local estate agencies I
secured reasonably affordable rental housing within a few weeks of being given
an ultimatum.</p>
<p>One day not long after I moved in to town, I decided I just couldn’t take anymore and I made a deal with myself. I gave
myself 6 months to change the way I felt about life, but it wasn’t just some
airy-fairy idea, I came up with a plan.</p>
<p>I had looked at
my life and realised in the past I had always caved; I put all my dreams away
in little mental compartments to do what other people wanted or expected me to
do, other people’s happiness was given higher value by me than my own.<br/></p>
<p>I was miserable,
but I decided this was my last chance to rebuild and start again. I knew, as I had
from the day I moved out of home at 17, that I was on my own. I had to deal
with everything life threw at me without the safety net of a family and this
was just another speed bump I was determined to work through.</p>
<p>My
dream/ambition had always been to write; I wanted to go to university and learn
how but had never had the opportunity, money or family support.</p>
<p>About the same
time as this realisation, I started seeing advertisements for Open Universities
Australia and applied to study online for a Bachelor of Arts degree with
Griffith University, at the ripe old age of 42.</p>
<p>I started as a
volunteer with the local Salvation Army chapter at about the same time I
applied for university; I worked behind the scenes packing food parcels in
their welfare department three mornings per week for the first two years of
study and one morning a week for part of my final year. I eventually stopped to
focus on my study.</p>
<p>I will be
forever grateful for HECS, if I had not been able to defer my fees I would not
have been able to study. </p>
<p>I budgeted so
strictly that I managed to keep paying off my car loan, paid rent, kept bills
up to date, and studied, without any financial help except my disability pension. I never received any monetary help from my ex while we were together and I knew I wouldn't receive anything when we split. I made my choice when I left and though it has made the last 5 years extremely difficult, I guess I can pride myself on doing it by myself. <br/></p>
<p>I was granted my
Bachelor of Arts degree in March 2013
after 3years of really hard work and, as an online student, no breaks between
semesters.</p>
<p>As soon as I
knew I had completed my Bachelor degree I applied and was accepted into the Master of Arts
(Writing) program with Swinburne University -<span> 
again online through Open Universities Australia.</span></p>
<p>I started in
June 2013 and in November2014 I completed the requirements for that degree. Despite the constant pit of depression and PTSD, I kept going because I realised it was  my last chance to achieve a heartfelt dream.<br/></p>
<p>Now, I need
help.</p>
<p>My graduation
ceremony is in Melbourne in April. I live in Perth, but on a disability pension and paying off a loan I have no scope to save money and no family to help.</p>
<p>I need to find
enough money to cover return airfares for myself (Perth/Melbourne), return
airfares for my cousin in Adelaide (the thought of traveling to Melbourne and
staying there – alone – is paralysing); I need taxi/petrol money for transfers
to and from airports in Perth, Adelaide, and Melbourne, a hotel room in Melbourne for three
nights, and taxi to and from the graduation ceremony.</p>
<p>My best estimate,
after looking at flight and accommodation costs is I will need approximately
$2000</p>
<p>If anyone can

<br/></div>","In 2009 I left
an abusive, long-term relationship; I was allowed to take the furniture I had
brought with me 9 years earlier, my car (with its $20,000 loan attached), my
clothes, my 16 year old cat, and my disability pension.
I was lost and
alone; I had no family and very few friends, and a serious case of depression
that saw me fighting the lure of suicide every day.
After scouring
the local newspapers, real estate web sites, and local estate agencies I
secured reasonably affordable rental housing within a few weeks of being given
an ultimatum.
One day not long after I moved in to town, I decided I just couldn’t take anymore and I made a deal with myself. I gave
myself 6 months to change the way I felt about life, but it wasn’t just some
airy-fairy idea, I came up with a plan.
I had looked at
my life and realised in the past I had always caved; I put all my dreams away
in little mental compartments to do what other people wanted or expected me to
do, other people’s happiness was given higher value by me than my own.
I was miserable,
but I decided this was my last chance to rebuild and start again. I knew, as I had
from the day I moved out of home at 17, that I was on my own. I had to deal
with everything life threw at me without the safety net of a family and this
was just another speed bump I was determined to work through.
My
dream/ambition had always been to write; I wanted to go to university and learn
how but had never had the opportunity, money or family support.
About the same
time as this realisation, I started seeing advertisements for Open Universities
Australia and applied to study online for a Bachelor of Arts degree with
Griffith University, at the ripe old age of 42.
I started as a
volunteer with the local Salvation Army chapter at about the same time I
applied for university; I worked behind the scenes packing food parcels in
their welfare department three mornings per week for the first two years of
study and one morning a week for part of my final year. I eventually stopped to
focus on my study.
I will be
forever grateful for HECS, if I had not been able to defer my fees I would not
have been able to study. 
I budgeted so
strictly that I managed to keep paying off my car loan, paid rent, kept bills
up to date, and studied, without any financial help except my disability pension. I never received any monetary help from my ex while we were together and I knew I wouldn't receive anything when we split. I made my choice when I left and though it has made the last 5 years extremely difficult, I guess I can pride myself on doing it by myself. 
I was granted my
Bachelor of Arts degree in March 2013
after 3years of really hard work and, as an online student, no breaks between
semesters.
As soon as I
knew I had completed my Bachelor degree I applied and was accepted into the Master of Arts
(Writing) program with Swinburne University - 
again online through Open Universities Australia.
I started in
June 2013 and in November2014 I completed the requirements for that degree. Despite the constant pit of depression and PTSD, I kept going because I realised it was  my last chance to achieve a heartfelt dream.
Now, I need
help.
My graduation
ceremony is in Melbourne in April. I live in Perth, but on a disability pension and paying off a loan I have no scope to save money and no family to help.
I need to find
enough money to cover return airfares for myself (Perth/Melbourne), return
airfares for my cousin in Adelaide (the thought of traveling to Melbourne and
staying there – alone – is paralysing); I need taxi/petrol money for transfers
to and from airports in Perth, Adelaide, and Melbourne, a hotel room in Melbourne for three
nights, and taxi to and from the graduation ceremony.
My best estimate,
after looking at flight and accommodation costs is I will need approximately
$2000
If anyone can
help at all, I would be very grateful. If, by some slim chance, people pledge
more than I need, the excess will go to paying off some of my car loan which will in turn make my day to day life easier.
I can't think of any better way to celebrate all the hard work of studying (with PTSD and depression) or to reward myself for continuing when all I wanted to do many times was just stop, than to wear that cap and gown in April and cross the stage with other degree recipients.   I still find it hard to believe I have gone from suicidal in 2009 to holding a Master of Arts (Writing) degree in 2014/15 and I can finally say I am proud of myself and how far I have come in 5 years. I still have a long way to go; I still deal with depression and PTSD on a daily basis but I know now that I'm not stupid, useless, or pathetic, contrary to what I have been told my entire life. Thank you for the time you have taken to read my story.

<p>I've loved the piano since I was very young and have been playing it since I was five years old.  I've played a lot of other instruments in my lifetime, too, always tinkering with them and ultimately figuring out how to fix them on my own.  I've always thought, knowing your instrument well enough to fix it makes you a true lover of the instrument and music in general.</p>
<div><br/></div>
<div>A couple of years ago, I was fortunate enough to stumble upon an apprenticeship opportunity with a Registered Piano Technician (RPT) by the name of Bill Shull, of Shull Piano Inc. out of Loma Linda, California.  I loved going to the shop and soaked up all of the knowledge I could.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The opportunity came about in a rather unconventional way.  I had my piano in storage for a time in Oceanside.  One day, a lady was moving a mattress and bumped a sprinkler head, setting off the entire system.  My piano sat in about 4 inches of water for I don't know how long.  As soon as I found out, I had my piano shipped to a piano technician for repairs.  When my baby grand was all fixed up and ready to come home, I jokingly said to the technician, ""It's too bad you don't have an apprenticeship program!  I'd really love to learn the trade!""  To which he replied, ""Well, it's funny you should say that.  My apprentices meet here at the shop every Thursday!  Why don't you come down next week?""  And that's when the door of opportunity flung wide open, and my dream career would be realized.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Eventually, travel time and cost made it difficult to meet with Bill and I had to stop attending his classes.  Soon after, I moved north to the Sierras and found myself quite comfortable in a small town, and met a fellow tinkerer of sorts, Ken.  He's been a mentor to me, encouraging me to experiment and offering support and a bit of his knowledge when I need it.  It's been a great relief after moving to a town where I wasn't sure I'd be able to continue my studies and aspirations of becoming a Registered Piano Technician.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Today, I received a brochure in the mail from the Piano Technicians Guild, a world-wide organization of piano technicians.  I've heard of them often and even get a few publications from them in my email.  These people are amazing.  Their knowledge and innovation is astounding!  They're creating their own tools, sharing stories and loving their lives and careers.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The brochure I got today was for the <a href=""http://www.westpac-ptg.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WESTPAC V</a> (Western and Pacific Regional Piano Technician's Guild Conference), held annually.  Honestly, I'm not sure how they got my mailing address, but I'm so glad they did!  Looking through this thing, I'm amazed at the number of classes, instructors, exhibits, and concerts.  I got so excited looking through it!  Imagine, Megan Jo, how much you could learn in these four days!  On the back page of this little booklet are the fees.  My excitement settled, and so did I.  But then I had this idea...  maybe the public would want to help send me to learn more of this trade.  Maybe they'd want to help me keep my dream alive and thriving.</div>
</div><div><br/></div><div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<b>Here are the fees, broken down</b>:</div>

<div>           --includes four full days of classes, exhibits, discussions and hands on learning!</div>
<div>A special class that I want to take for voicing is; <b>$95</b>
</div>
<div>A room at the cheapest hotel in Ontario, CA; $49/night.  4 nights; <b>196+tx</b>

<div>I haven't figured in gas or food.  If I'm only $100 short, I'll go but not take the special class.  If I don't raise enough to go at all, the money will be held for next year's conference.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>A little bit about Piano Technology and what they'll be teaching at the conference;</div>
<div>
<b>Tuning</b> a piano isn't as easy as you might think.  Sure, some, maybe even most, technicians use an electronic tuning device.   However, to pass the exam and gain the title of Registered Piano Technician (RPT), you have to tune a piano perfectly by ear using only one tuning fork.  I'm sure you can imagine how difficult that might be!  It's not just about getting the frequencies to stop fighting (as with a guitar), it's about getting them to fight just the right amount.  At the conference, they'll be teaching specific methods to help make it a little easier.  I'm really looking forward to that!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<b>Voicing</b> a piano has to do with manipulating the tone that is produced when the hammers hit the strings.  If the hammers are too hard, the tone is bright and may even hurt the ears.  If the tone is too dull, it's difficult, if not impossible, for a pianist to get the right expression out of the instrument.  When the tone is to bright, a tool is used with a series of sharp needles on it, and those needles are pressed into the hammer head felt to help soften the fibers and thus softening the tone.  If the hammers are too soft, several methods could be applied.   Most commonly, a solution of lacquer is put on the hammers and allowed to dry, stiffening the fibers and therefore brightening the tone.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<b>Regulating</b> a piano involves all sorts of tiny measurements.  When a piano is regulated, the feel of the keys is what's really being worked on.  Every component in the action (the parts that make the piano play) is designed to work at exactly the right time and with exactly the right force and exactly the right amount of movement.  If something is off, the whole thing is off.  This is a part of piano tech that I don't have any experience with and am most excited to dive right in to.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<b>Repairing</b> a piano encompasses SO much, there isn't any way I could possibly try to fit it all in here.  There are so many moving parts in a piano, all of them susceptible to damage from the changes in weather.  Felts get warn out, things stop moving, things break...  You get the idea.  Repairing pianos is a lifelong pursuit and I am looking forward to the journey!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<b>Rebuilding</b> a piano is something I got a little taste of while working with Bill Shull.  There is some amazing feeling you get when something is just a shell of itself and you're the one slowly putting it back together and making it sing like it ought to!  What a fascinating experience!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The conference also offers smaller classes like specific repairs on small piano parts and also one for building your own tools.</div>

<div>Hello to all Conifer High School alumni or current students, my name is Thomas Kim. I graduated from our little school May 2013, and currently study architecture at Syracuse University. I wanted to pitch this crazy idea to you guys, but first let me explain why. The man, the legend, Mr Gunnar has touched our lives in one way or another. He was there for us when you needed help not only in school, but for personal reasons and anything beyond that spectrum. Mr. Gunnar is one of the most devoted teachers I have ever crossed paths with, and that path will not be easy to cross once again. </div>
<div>I remember my junior year in high school, we were all assigned our personal narratives. After being touched by many of the stories I heard from the seniors, I decided to release my own story - something I had kept within myself and family for a while. It was a story about my mother, whom passed away from ovarian/breast cancer in the winter of 2008, on December 20th. As a 13 year old, I could not accept reality and the future that was dawning upon me. It seemed to all be a blur, and things seemed to be moving so fast until it all came to a sudden halt when Mr. Gunnar approached me about writing about my mother. </div>
<div>It was not until then when I realized that I hadn't really tried to reminisce, to hide the pain, and I never really attempted to think about it all until he prompted me to. Through many tears and sorrow, I finally had built up the courage to write a paper about my mother. And ever since, I had my mind cleared, and my goals set. It was an enlightening moment for me, to discover myself through self analysis and literature. All made possible by our beloved Mr. Gunnar.</div>
<div>If you guys have not heard yet, Mr. Gunnar will be retiring as an English teacher at our old high school, and will be stepping down officially on September 30th. I think that out of a lot of people in our lives, this man deserves something spectacular after all he has done for us. It's time we bucked our heads together and make something great happen for someone we greatly appreciate in our lives.</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p>I began talking to Mr. Gunnar about what he would like to do after retirement, and since I'm a super spy, I sensed that he has NO idea what I'm doing with the information he gave me. I asked him, ""Mr. Gunnar, if you could go anywhere on Earth, where would it be and why? I was just wondering because I always wondered why people do what they do after retirement (do people really wonder that though?)"" To which he replied, ""I'd love to go to the Far East. I've never been there before, and I think it would be mesmerizing."" </p> <ul>
<li>Ever since his reply, I have researched for a couple hours and found that the average price of a trip to send Mr. Gunnar to Delhi, India with a fully guided tour + flight will run us about 1500-2000 dollars. Crazy, I know. </li> <li>I really apologize, my hands are full these days and I really can't come up with many perks to offer you guys. You will receive my genuine thanks and ever lasting love of course, and the least I can do is offer you a free photoshoot with an unlimited number of people, in a location of your own choosing (keep in mind that I return to Syracuse August 19th). </li> <li>If our wallets cannot conquer this big price tag, then all funds will go to Mr. Gunnar, in hopes that his savings account can suffice for the rest. Its the thought that counts right? </li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Truth</h3> <p>Every single day we spend money on stupid little things like skittles (which are actually not that dumb, especially if you get the tropical kind), fast food (just make a PB&amp;J if you have to, its way cheaper) and little knick knacks, y'all know what I'm talking about. </p>
<p>All I'm asking you to do is to direct 15-30 dollars of the money you would be spending on fart pillows or plastic spoons, towards the cause of sending this awesome dude halfway across the world. </p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>2000 DOLLARS?! You're f*****g crazy!</h3> <p> Yeah, I know. I like living in the fast lane. But its just because I don't want to send him on a trip into a foreign country where he'll be guided by the local kartel whom might lure him into their drug ops and before we know it we have a world conflict between the US and India (whom I really haven't heard much from in the news... but then again I don't watch the news). </p>
<p>I'll admit. I've never done this before. I just know from growing up in Conifer that our community bond is one of the strongest I'll ever experience. I'm not sure if we're gonna hit that 2K but I sure as hell believe that if we all work together, it can be done. Neil walked on the moon, so why can't we raise two thousand dollars?</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help Without $$$$$</h3> <p>15 dollars though... Really? But really, I understand. I'm a broke college kid just like you are. I'm just in a spot right now where the money I'll be putting in here is just the difference between a few meals and some architecture supplies, which I can salvage and starve for. But if you SERIOUSLY can't put in any money to this cause, I completely understand, no hard feelings. Heres what you can do instead;</p> <ul>
<li>Like I said, Conifer has a pretty big heart. If we get the community involved with this, 2K is gonna be a reality in no time. Help us get the word out! But make sure to do it quietly enough so that it doesn't reach Mr. Gunnar's ears! And if it does, tell him he's crazy for thinking that people are raising two thousand dollars for him to travel to India. Crazy. Just craaaaaaazy. </li> <li>Word of mouth, texting, PHONE CALLS (something we need to bring back these days for Christ's sake), e-mails(?), snail mail, pony express, pigeon, telepathy, post card. Anything. It's gonna help. </li> </ul>
</div> <p>Lets do this together guys. Giving back is the greatest joy there is, ain't it?</p></div>","Mr. Rolf Gunnar

But its just because I don't want to send him on a trip into a foreign country where he'll be guided by the local kartel whom might lure him into their drug ops and before we know it we have a world conflict between the US and India (whom I really haven't heard much from in the news... but then again I don't watch the news). 
I'll admit. I've never done this before. I just know from growing up in Conifer that our community bond is one of the strongest I'll ever experience. I'm not sure if we're gonna hit that 2K but I sure as hell believe that if we all work together, it can be done. Neil walked on the moon, so why can't we raise two thousand dollars?
  Other Ways You Can Help Without $$$$$ 15 dollars though... Really? But really, I understand. I'm a broke college kid just like you are. I'm just in a spot right now where the money I'll be putting in here is just the difference between a few meals and some architecture supplies, which I can salvage and starve for. But if you SERIOUSLY can't put in any money to this cause, I completely understand, no hard feelings. Heres what you can do instead; 
Like I said, Conifer has a pretty big heart. If we get the community involved with this, 2K is gonna be a reality in no time. Help us get the word out! But make sure to do it quietly enough so that it doesn't reach Mr. Gunnar's ears! And if it does, tell him he's crazy for thinking that people are raising two thousand dollars for him to travel to India. Crazy. Just craaaaaaazy.  Word of mouth, texting, PHONE CALLS (something we need to bring back these days for Christ's sake), e-mails(?), snail mail, pony express, pigeon, telepathy, post card. Anything. It's gonna help.  
 Lets do this together guys. Giving back is the greatest joy there is, ain't it?",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Hello! My name is Luis Garces, I
live in México City, I am 19 years old and just graduated from high school.</p>
<p>I have always had a desire to travel and
learn from other cultures. My goal is to increase my perspective and ideologies
on life and the world before studding at college. </p>
<p>For that reason my plan before starting
college next January 2015 will be traveling to Thailand, India and Cambodia
with a group of 18 students and 3 program leaders during 18 weeks.</p>
<p>I was accepted in a program called
Thinking Beyond Border. We are going to be studying alimentation and education
in those countries and at the end of the three months we will make a project
and meet representatives in Washington from the World Bank, Congress, and NGOs
to raise awareness about education and alimentation.</p>
<p>What I want to achieve during this three
months is to learn from critical global issues and from different needs people
have in different countries.</p>
<p>In Thailand I will be living with a host
family and do fieldwork with locals to investigate how farmers, government, and
businesses cooperate to balance demand for food with the ecosystem in Northern
Thailand.</p>
<p>In India I will explore how education
can empower individuals and communities to improve health and create equity and
justice, and work in education centers for women and children in some of the
poorest parts of Jaipur. </p>
<p>And in Cambodia as part of the program I
will be exploring Angkor Wat and Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>With this program I will have the
opportunity to help other, improve my self and learn different points of view
and living, and most importantly, the experience will provide me with insight
that was once inconceivable. </p>
<p>This journey will supply me with culture
awareness, maturity, a more globalized perspective on issues, and have an
impact on the lives of others as I realize the part I play in this world. </p>
<p>I would greatly appreciate contribution
from you.</p>
<p><b>Fundraising:</b></p>
<p>Total Tuition (including estimated
airfare): $14,250</p>

and all funds will go directly to my tuition. Even if this goal is not reached
the flexible fundraising option still allows the money to go towards my trip
and will still be matched by Thinking Beyond Borders.</p>

<p><b>Dharma Civilization Foundation</b> (<a href=""www.dcfusa.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">DCF</a>) is a California based <b>501(c)3</b> Non-Profit Community-based Organization. It seeks to <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">promote and enhance establishment of the systematic study of ""Dharma,"" </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">its interpretation and application in modern contexts. Establishing ""Applied Dharma"" for today's world requires a strong university presence.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>In the first phase at USC, DCF established a visiting professor in Hindu Studies, which is running successfully since the last two years and has been a phenomenal success.</p>
<p>In its second phase at USC, DCF is establishing the <b><i>Swami Vivekananda Endowed Chair in Hindu Dharma Studies</i></b> and seeks its funding through community efforts. This endowment will be the foundation of the future <i><b>Swami Vivekananda Center for Indic Civilization and Dharma Studies</b></i>.</p>
<p>JOIN US IN THIS HISTORIC HERITAGE COMMUNITY INITIATIVE.</p>
<p>This initiative at USC is of critical importance in today's context where Dharma does not have its own voice in American Academia. It aims to achieve the following:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">To promote the understanding of India's Civilization,
Religion, and Culture through Education.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Create a community of Scholar-Practitioners.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Representation of Dharma in American Academia, where its
current representation is negligible.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">To ""<i>promote a concord of civilizations rather than the clash of civilizations.</i>""</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">To preserve the beautiful messages of the Gita, Upanishads,
Yoga, &amp; Vedanta etc.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>









This effort will shape the future of Dharma Education in North America. </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The chair at USC requires $3.3 Million. So far the pledged &amp; collected funds are above $700,000, which is 25% of the total requirement.  Another 25% is being collected from Southern California, and the next 25% is being raised through various events &amp; donors through out USA. <b><b>The remaining 25% or more is being raised <b>through the crowd-funding community: THAT'S YOU!</b></b></b></p>
<p></p>

<p>The biggest reward for the dharma-donor is that you will become a <i>Dharmapala</i> (Dharma Hero), preserving and protecting Dharma for future generations.</p>

</div></div>","Introduction 
Dharma Civilization Foundation (DCF) is a California based 501(c)3 Non-Profit Community-based Organization. It seeks to promote and enhance establishment of the systematic study of ""Dharma,"" its interpretation and application in modern contexts. Establishing ""Applied Dharma"" for today's world requires a strong university presence.

In the first phase at USC, DCF established a visiting professor in Hindu Studies, which is running successfully since the last two years and has been a phenomenal success.
In its second phase at USC, DCF is establishing the Swami Vivekananda Endowed Chair in Hindu Dharma Studies and seeks its funding through community efforts. This endowment will be the foundation of the future Swami Vivekananda Center for Indic Civilization and Dharma Studies.
JOIN US IN THIS HISTORIC HERITAGE COMMUNITY INITIATIVE.
This initiative at USC is of critical importance in today's context where Dharma does not have its own voice in American Academia. It aims to achieve the following:




To promote the understanding of India's Civilization,
Religion, and Culture through Education.


Create a community of Scholar-Practitioners.


Representation of Dharma in American Academia, where its
current representation is negligible.


To ""promote a concord of civilizations rather than the clash of civilizations.""


To preserve the beautiful messages of the Gita, Upanishads,
Yoga, & Vedanta etc.











This effort will shape the future of Dharma Education in North America.   What We Need & What You Get The chair at USC requires $3.3 Million. So far the pledged & collected funds are above $700,000, which is 25% of the total requirement.  Another 25% is being collected from Southern California, and the next 25% is being raised through various events & donors through out USA. The remaining 25% or more is being raised through the crowd-funding community: THAT'S YOU!

All donors will be recognized on the Website as Dharma Donors.
The biggest reward for the dharma-donor is that you will become a Dharmapala (Dharma Hero), preserving and protecting Dharma for future generations.


Join us in this effort to establish Dharma in the Temples of Knowledge, so that the ideal of ""One Consciousness, One Humanity, One Destiny"" does not disappear from the earth. 

  The Impact 



The Swami Vivekananda Chair at USC will be in the School of Religion which is about to open the first Ph.D. Program in Asian Religions in Southern California.


This is an important milestone because there are currently no other Ph.D.  programs in the religions of Asia that serves the approx. 18 M people of SoCal. 


 The Swami Vivekananda Chair would make it possible to offer a PhD focus on the Dharma Traditions of India and Hindu Dharma in particular. 

Your contribution will ensure  the inclusion of Dharma in the first Ph.D. program in Religious Studies (beyond the Abrahamic religions) amongst the major universities of Southern California. 
This will develop multi-deciplinary programs in Indic Civilization & Dharma Studies such as: 


       GE (required General Education) courses


       Certificate Programs


       Minor & Major Undergraduate programs


       Concentrations in graduate degree programs

       Research applications of Dharma principals such as: integration, pluralism, sustainability, and contemplative studies.  



  Challenges  How do we ensure that the University will honor the “intent” and “spirit” of the donor?

The intention and purpose of the donor is clearly documented and stipulated in the gift agreement. This is a legal document, and is binding on the University. The Agreement also ensures that University’s Faculty search process recruits a Professor who is eminently suited to fulfill the intention of the donor.  The DCF and heritage community will be in ongoing engagement with the designated faculty and administration so as to ensure that the donor’s intent is preserved across key transitions. 
  Other Ways You Can Help Please spread the word about DCF's work & campaign to fund Swami Vivekananda Chair at USC.

<h3>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">Hello contributors, my name is Desiree Crossman and I go by Traveling Yoginista. I've spent the last decade traveling abroad, broke as a joke, or as a smart saver, it really depends on the situation. When I younger, I knew I wanted to explore the globe, I felt this innate connection with the exploration of what mother earth has to offer. I spent my years in the twenties living it up, not exactly sure of the path I was taking, until I came into an intense relationship that changed my life. </span><br/>
</h3>
<p>This relationship helped me in so many ways and even during the darkest, and difficult moments, I somehow turned to yoga. I had no idea what I was doing and I don't know why I fell into it. However 3 years later, during this pivotal year of re-examining myself and who I am, I understood it was what was needed to be who I am now. </p>
<p>In a short story version, I went to school for six months training for the certification back in 2011. I received the certification in Dec 2011, I had so much information going on in my head,  at the same time I was looking to explore southeast Asia on my own to see what other teachers had to offer. I was complacent in San Diego, I felt there was more. In 2012 I saved enough money to travel to Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Bali (<a href=""http://www.travelingyoginista.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.travelingyoginista.com</a>). It was a profound experience and I gained a lot of insight. I was single at the time but was missing my ex and so after I returned to the states, we rekindled. It didn't last long.</p>
<p>All of 2013 I decided to move to the Philippines to practice with an Indian who was born into yoga by family and I spent six months training with him and his beautiful wife. I lived in their home, slept on the mat on the floor, took cold showers, walked everywhere, lived off peanuts. It was intense. I also rekindled again with my significant other understanding forgiveness, acceptance, compassion, compromise, and being present. I loved and love to love. I gave all I could give, but when the energy is not connecting, what do you do? I was unknowingly, suppressing my emotions. I went into robotic mode just plugging away to yoga and trying to keep an emotional draining relationship alive by trying to be perfect for someone and holding onto what seemed to hold on to me, yoga. </p>
<p>Towards the end of 2013, there was something that developing in me that I felt but was again, suppressing. The intuition was becoming heightened and I felt like I was drowning, I wasn't myself. We went back to the states, and something told me I needed to cut ties. It came over me, and I was a hostage. I left my ex and I didn't look back. I couldn't, that force took over and I was battling my heart versus my head for months. I went through ups and downs and it enabled me to keep focus of what I didn't loose, yoga. This year was the biggest learning experience I could of gone through and I began to understand things with clarity though I was going through sadness. Yoga was my THERAPY. </p>
<p> This year I took more training, I learned human design (3/5 profile), I delve into managing a yoga studio, I taught as much as I could, I worked three jobs to make up for the mistakes I made last year, and I sacrificed what I thought was going to be forever, I had to. I knew who I was, and it seemed everything else was pushing me to live it. I saw 11:11 everywhere and so, my spirit was being reborn. The force kept me moving forward no matter how many times I was on the verge of breaking, I was transitioning into the person I was meant to be and I still am. </p>
<p>Readers, I LOVE teaching! I love teaching yoga, I love learning. I'm blind in my left eye and I am naturally an introvert. Yoga has helped me overcome so much fear within myself and to be able to share what I learn onto others is substantial to my growth as a person. Writing this is coming from the heart and soul. This year I went from having no money, not sure where I was going to teach, thankfully living free with people to save money, to now taking more training workshops, putting together events, managing a studio, working on weekends, and saving. I live in a tiny little studio (thanks to learning how to live sufficiently and thrifty) with no tv, no couch, just a couple of thai mats to sleep on, a portable hot plate cooker, and a yoga mat. Yes, I live about as simple as you can imagine. I didn't even have internet for nearly 5 months. Luckily I had a car still. </p>
<p>Going to India has been a goal of mine for years, I said I was going to go, and I am. I initially booked a one way this year to Rishikesh to take my course in October but the intuition told me to wait until the beginning of next year, for a couple reasons. 1) I needed to save more money and 2) The intuition told me opportunities would present themselves and I needed to stay longer. I honored that intuition. </p>
<p>The contributions from this campaign will allow me to travel comfortably for 5 months. I booked a one way ticket to Delhi, put aside money for training which is $1630 for six weeks intensive. After the training, I intend to either go to Nepal on a backpacking adventure (I've never backpacked believe it or not despite traveling around the globe), travel to Thailand to retake my Thai massage course in Chiang Mai and then travel back to the Philippines for a month. I love taking photos as well and who's to say I won't work while I'm away, an opportunity may present itself along the way.I would like to volunteer my time somewhere when I'm abroad as well. I looked into getting the TESL certification and the program I contacted was to send me to Myanmar but it was $3,000 for the training. I just want to feel safe regardless. This is a six month adventure, tentatively and I have some money saved, but nearly enough. This is why I choose to give Indiegogo a try. </p>

I am me, and I hope you enjoy reading of the substance within me. </span><br/></p>

Your dollar matters because it will help support a soul living in this world doing what it was meant to do. There will be ups and downs, trials and tribulations, I'm introverted, I like to go off the radar for awhile to reset my mind. I don't like doing the social media thing, I don't but in this day in age, I've learned to accept it. I choose the name Traveling Yoginista for a reason, I love to travel, I love to share what I learned, I observe, I learn, I am a yogi. There are fashionistas, baristas, senoritas, but not many yoginistas. Be a yoginista, be you and stand for you. I say I a lot, because I am my own experiment and experience. </p>

I love taking photos as well and who's to say I won't work while I'm away, an opportunity may present itself along the way.I would like to volunteer my time somewhere when I'm abroad as well. I looked into getting the TESL certification and the program I contacted was to send me to Myanmar but it was $3,000 for the training. I just want to feel safe regardless. This is a six month adventure, tentatively and I have some money saved, but nearly enough. This is why I choose to give Indiegogo a try. 
At my age, though I'm in my 30's I accepted I am a non conformist, and I'm ok with it. I learned I'm an INTJ on the MBTI, which allowed me to accept what I knew all along, I like to think and master what I set out to do, I want to master my craft of travel and yoga, to be able to share and teach what I learned, even the mistakes. I am me, and I hope you enjoy reading of the substance within me. 
* Indian Visa/Nepalese
* Malaria shot
* Trains, planes, automobiles, boats - transportation
* Allowing myself to volunteer
* Any additional training I find a long the way
 I will be a 500 hour Experienced Registered Yoga Teacher (ERYT) and I can start to train other teachers on a path like mine. 
  If I don't reach my goal of $3,000 it will go towards my return. I'll have financial stability ready for me when I return back to the states. You can also follow my journey on my website www.travelingyoginista.com.    
    This is why your dollar matters! Some of my family say I'm running away, but really I'm actually going home and returning home. The dollar[s] you contribute, if you had the opportunity to do it, would you? There's nothing else I can describe other then I have been through trials and tribulations of life, I've made mistakes, I've traveled, I've lived, and want to keep living. Your dollar matters because it will help support a soul living in this world doing what it was meant to do. There will be ups and downs, trials and tribulations, I'm introverted, I like to go off the radar for awhile to reset my mind. I don't like doing the social media thing, I don't but in this day in age, I've learned to accept it. I choose the name Traveling Yoginista for a reason, I love to travel, I love to share what I learned, I observe, I learn, I am a yogi. There are fashionistas, baristas, senoritas, but not many yoginistas. Be a yoginista, be you and stand for you. I say I a lot, because I am my own experiment and experience.

<p> </p>
<p>Ukwaluka: South Africa 2013 Project, in its maiden year, plans to take 10 African-American, African, Caribbean, and Latino students in their senior year of high school to South Africa for approximately two weeks, to engage them in educational, community-based activities and give them in-depth exposure to South African culture, diversity and institutions. The purpose of this, as outlined in the Proposal, is to uplift and empower these young men, in the absence of appropriate male role models, and help them to develop the inner resources to advance their education and become socially responsible leaders.  The following are objectives for this project, addressed in great detail in the proposal:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Create equity among students</strong>. </li>
<li>
<strong>Improve college</strong> <strong>readiness and employment marketability.</strong> </li>
<li>
<strong>Mentor students in becoming global citizens who contribute to all communities.</strong> </li>
<li>
<strong>Enhance school culture and build incentives for current and prospective students.</strong> </li>

<p> </p>
<p>Funding for the travel and lodging portion of this trip is our greatest priority, as well as building an endowment that will allow this project to continue and expand. A contribution from you will give us the jumpstart we need while we continue to implement a recently developed series of fundraisers. We believe that this program can make a significant difference for young men who right now find themselves limited by their neighborhoods and income from moving out into the world and expanding their horizons and contributions.</p>

I'm freelance journalist and blogger covering politics, culture and literature. I've written for several Northern Californian publications and have been fortunate to interview a broad scope of people with contrasting ideologies such as Bill Ayers, Karl Rove and Ted Haggard. In 2010 I was a finalist in the Nation's student essay contest.

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>With your help I plan to travel to Jordan this summer and join my colleague Jordan Hattar (featured in the video above), as well as a documentary film crew from Stanford University, in telling the stories of the Syrian refugees at the Zaatari camp, as well as those in Amman and the outskirts of the city (<a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17258397"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">click here</a> for more information on the Syrian refugee crisis). Hattar has asked me to lend my skills in multimedia, photography,and journalism to take a more in-depth look at the situation than what is being offered by the major media outlets. Hattar hopes that through raising awareness of this situation we can secure semi-permanent housing for families trying to survive the harsh winter ahead. Last year Hattar, in association with <a href=""http://beta.syriadeeply.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Syria Deeply</a>, raised $12,000 for winter accommodations for the camp. This year with help from the<a href=""http://www.clintonglobalinitiative.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Clinton Global Initiative</a> we plan on doing even more for those who have survived immense losses and are now without a home, a country or a clear future. With your help we can present the international community with a clear picture of the situation, hopfully leading to greater efforts towards resolving this crisis.    </p>
<p>For three weeks I will be to reporting daily via Bold Type as well as in any other interested publications. Besides telling the personal stories within the camp I will investigate the socio-economic structure of the camp and talk to officials within the Jordanian government, as well as other aid agencies, to find out what international action/inaction means for the Syrian people and the international commuity at large. We are also in the process of securing an interview with King Abdullah regarding the impact this situation is having on Jordan and what he feels the role of the international community should be now that the crisis is spiraling out of control with over 1 million Syrians fleeing their country.  </p>

Currie Dinosaur Museum is 10 years in the making and we are now happy to announce that we're breaking ground in April! These are exciting times but we still need your help - a further $7 million is needed to finish the project.</span></p>
<p><span>The building is designed, the land is secured, the tendering documents are prepared, and we are currently teaching ten different education programs in area schools. We even have celebrity endorsement. Dan Aykroyd and his family are our International Ambassadors and Criminal Minds’ Matthew Gray Gubler came out last year to help with our big annual fundraiser. Patricia Cornwell, America’s best-selling crime writer<span class=""apple-converted-space"">’s latest </span><em>Scarpetta</em>-series book was inspired by her visit to our site last year, calling it<span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span><em>The Bonebed.</em></span></p>

<p><span>(Architect's rendering of the museum's Dinosaur Gallery)</span></p>
<p><span>Financially, we’ve raised a big chunk of cash: over $20 million of $30 million. We're breaking ground in April and the museum, if all goes well, will host its Grand Opening in June 2014. We still need a bit of help on the way, though. Beyond funding that is presently underway or being confirmed, we still need $7 million more to finish the project. This is where you come in.</span></p>
<p><span>But before we get carried away with enthusiasm, let’s back up and explain. There’s no denying dinosaurs are fascinating, the stuff of mythical creatures – only real. We’re lucky – in northern Alberta there are dinosaur fossils everywhere. Palaeontologists have already excavated more than their store rooms can hold.</span></p>
<p><span>With such a treasure trove of ancient riches here, we want to build a world-class museum to bring these fossils ‘to life’ as it were. The effort has been underway for 10 years now and for the last two a full-time paid staff of five people has been dedicated to making the museum a reality.</span></p>

<p>(Crew of palaeontologists and visiting celebrities - that's Matthew Gray Gubler in the brown hat - on the Pachyrhinosaurus lakustai bonebed.)</p>
<p><span>And we have a plan! It’s a good one. The facility will be called the Philip J. Currie Dinosaur Museum, after Canada’s most prolific and popular palaeontologist. It will be 41,000 square feet of world-class technology combined with some of the oldest, most interesting stuff around – fossils dating as far back as 120 million years.</span></p>

<p>(Architect's drawing of the finished museum building.)</p>
<p><span>The facility is designed to be a LEED-certified (this means eco-friendly) educational and research centre in the heart of the Peace Country in northwest Alberta, Canada. Its unique shape will be visible from the highway, a silhouette inspired by a dinosaur’s body. Designed by Toronto-based Teeple Architects, the museum will feature extensive gallery spaces, two SMART-technology classrooms, a 64-seat theatre, research and collections areas, a restaurant, gift shop, and tourist services on a three-level design. More details on its exceptionally cool exhibits come at the end of this profile.</span></p>

<p align=""center"">(Blueprint graphic of the museum's interior. Courtesy Beauchamp Creative) </p>
<p><span>As you can see, a lot has already been done. So what do we need? Dollars, plain and simple. We’re looking for the remaining funds needed to go straight into the capital program. This is the money that will pay for the lumber, nails, engineers and carpenters that will make this museum rise up from the ground.</span></p>
<p align=""center""><strong><span>Why here?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>This area has been described as a ‘vertitable gold mine’ by palaeontologists. It all began in 1974 when a young schoolteacher stumbled upon fossilized dinosaur bones. It was a clue that led to the discovery of the world’s densest horned dinosaur bonebed – a jumble of literally thousands of bones, belonging to a new species of dinosaur, <em>Pachyrhinosaurus lakustai</em>. Hundreds of animals died at once, for reasons scientists are still trying to work out. A second horned dinosaur bonebed was discovered in the 1980s.</span></p>
<p><img alt=""A team excavating the first bonebed in 1987."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/474201/pictures/full/20121004105716-Bonebed_1987_-_4.JPG?1349373453"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>(Palaeontologists from the Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology excavating the bonebed in 1989.)</p>
<p><span>Interest has ramped up in the past few years as the area becomes better known internationally as a place of massive palaeontological potential. Scientists from Italy, Trinidad and Spain have come to this area to excavate in the past two years, as have others from the Royal Tyrrell Museum, the University of Alberta and the Royal Ontario Museum.</span></p>

<p><span>In the cumulative period of just a few weeks spread out over the past two field seasons, palaeontologists have discovered two skeletons of duck-billed hadrosaurs, replete with impressions of their scaly hide; nearly a dozen footprints from giant tyrannosaurs, hadrosaurs, and ankylosaurs; and a possible new species of small carnivorous dinosaur not unlike the famed<span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span><em>Velociraptor</em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span>from “Jurassic Park”.

<p>We don’t want to overload you with information but we’re extremely proud of the exhibits designed for this museum. We’ll give you just a brief snapshot of some of our favorites.</p>
<p><strong>Dinosaur Gallery:</strong> Fossils everywhere! From towering skeletons overhead to smaller ones underfoot, this Gallery is our showstopper. It features nearly 7,000 sq. feet of an assemblage of intriguing beasts, from Alberta’s newest species never before showcased in a museum to a pantheon of dinosaurs discovered in the Peace Region.</p>
<p><strong>Oil and Gas Wing:</strong><strong> </strong>Nearly 3,000 sq. feet of interactive discovery – what is the connection between dinosaurs and the industry that powers our world? Kids will love the Discovery Wall, where they pretend to be a drilling rig seeking repositories of oil and natural gas.</p>
<p><strong>Education Centre:</strong><strong> </strong>Learning concentrates here. Two SMART-technology classrooms and a 64-person theatre will host our hugely popular curriculum-based K-12 programs, lectures by resident and visiting scientists, live performances and special screenings.</p>
<p><strong>Palaeontology Laboratory and Research Centre:</strong><strong> </strong>A collections area and laboratory where resident and visiting scientists will conduct cutting-edge research. A glass viewing platform gives visitors a bird’s-eye view of all the action.</p>
<p><strong>Special Exhibit Gallery:</strong><strong> </strong>This gallery will host a wide and ever-changing range of displays and travelling exhibits to be showcased, including art and artifacts.</p>
<p><strong>The Bonebed:</strong><strong> </strong>Try out your palaeontological skills! The bonebed is a re-creation of a local dig site containing thousands of jumbled bones. Conduct your own prehistoric CSI investigations to crack the case of why hundreds of animals died in one spot.</p>
<p><strong>Time Spiral Staircase:</strong><strong> </strong>As visitors spiral their way upward they will travel from the prehistoric to the present. Information-graphics representing the different time periods are coupled with actual fossils inserted in the walls of the stairway to illustrate the dazzling diversity of life through time.</p>
<p><strong>Interactive Dig Wall:</strong><strong> </strong>Visitors put on their palaeo hats at this display. It couldn’t be more hands-on. This re-creation of a dig site allows visitors to use provided tools to slowly excavate replica bones, which they can remove. </p>
<p><strong>Discovery Tent:</strong><strong> </strong>This display is a re-creation of a palaeontologist field tent and camp set-up. The tent will be equipped with palaeontological tools and equipment, as well as costumes and other gear for play ‘excavation.’</p>

Currie Dinosaur Museum is 10 years in the making and we are now happy to announce that we're breaking ground in April! These are exciting times but we still need your help - a further $7 million is needed to finish the project.
The building is designed, the land is secured, the tendering documents are prepared, and we are currently teaching ten different education programs in area schools. We even have celebrity endorsement. Dan Aykroyd and his family are our International Ambassadors and Criminal Minds’ Matthew Gray Gubler came out last year to help with our big annual fundraiser. Patricia Cornwell, America’s best-selling crime writer’s latest Scarpetta-series book was inspired by her visit to our site last year, calling it The Bonebed.

(Architect's rendering of the museum's Dinosaur Gallery)
Financially, we’ve raised a big chunk of cash: over $20 million of $30 million. We're breaking ground in April and the museum, if all goes well, will host its Grand Opening in June 2014. We still need a bit of help on the way, though. Beyond funding that is presently underway or being confirmed, we still need $7 million more to finish the project. This is where you come in.
But before we get carried away with enthusiasm, let’s back up and explain. There’s no denying dinosaurs are fascinating, the stuff of mythical creatures – only real. We’re lucky – in northern Alberta there are dinosaur fossils everywhere. Palaeontologists have already excavated more than their store rooms can hold.
With such a treasure trove of ancient riches here, we want to build a world-class museum to bring these fossils ‘to life’ as it were. The effort has been underway for 10 years now and for the last two a full-time paid staff of five people has been dedicated to making the museum a reality.
 
(Crew of palaeontologists and visiting celebrities - that's Matthew Gray Gubler in the brown hat - on the Pachyrhinosaurus lakustai bonebed.)
And we have a plan! It’s a good one. The facility will be called the Philip J. Currie Dinosaur Museum, after Canada’s most prolific and popular palaeontologist. It will be 41,000 square feet of world-class technology combined with some of the oldest, most interesting stuff around – fossils dating as far back as 120 million years.

(Architect's drawing of the finished museum building.)
The facility is designed to be a LEED-certified (this means eco-friendly) educational and research centre in the heart of the Peace Country in northwest Alberta, Canada. Its unique shape will be visible from the highway, a silhouette inspired by a dinosaur’s body. Designed by Toronto-based Teeple Architects, the museum will feature extensive gallery spaces, two SMART-technology classrooms, a 64-seat theatre, research and collections areas, a restaurant, gift shop, and tourist services on a three-level design. More details on its exceptionally cool exhibits come at the end of this profile.

As you can see, a lot has already been done. So what do we need? Dollars, plain and simple. We’re looking for the remaining funds needed to go straight into the capital program. This is the money that will pay for the lumber, nails, engineers and carpenters that will make this museum rise up from the ground.
Why here?
This area has been described as a ‘vertitable gold mine’ by palaeontologists. It all began in 1974 when a young schoolteacher stumbled upon fossilized dinosaur bones. It was a clue that led to the discovery of the world’s densest horned dinosaur bonebed – a jumble of literally thousands of bones, belonging to a new species of dinosaur, Pachyrhinosaurus lakustai. Hundreds of animals died at once, for reasons scientists are still trying to work out. A second horned dinosaur bonebed was discovered in the 1980s.

(Palaeontologists from the Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology excavating the bonebed in 1989.)
Interest has ramped up in the past few years as the area becomes better known internationally as a place of massive palaeontological potential. Scientists from Italy, Trinidad and Spain have come to this area to excavate in the past two years, as have others from the Royal Tyrrell Museum, the University of Alberta and the Royal Ontario Museum.

(Palaeontologist Dr. Phil Bell, project palaeontologist, applies glue to fossilized Hadrosaur skin found on the Red Willow River last year.) 
In the cumulative period of just a few weeks spread out over the past two field seasons, palaeontologists have discovered two skeletons of duck-billed hadrosaurs, replete with impressions of their scaly hide; nearly a dozen footprints from giant tyrannosaurs, hadrosaurs, and ankylosaurs; and a possible new species of small carnivorous dinosaur not unlike the famed Velociraptor from “Jurassic Park”. Even the delicate fossils of plants and tiny insects have been discovered, some of which are new to science. The discoveries will only increase in the coming years. It’s going to be a wonderful thing to be able to bring all the excitement together in one stellar facility.

<p>Imagine if, in addition to studying complex languages like Shakespeare, algebra, physics and French, our children could study the equally complex language of emotions.

Many people instinctively treat those perceived as different with distrust, fear and contempt. Such rigid modes of experiencing lead to conflict, and poor social and emotional skills have been negatively correlated with academic success. Existing social and emotional literacy programs have achieved some success; however, they are often squeezed into an already full academic day, and are rarely implemented across grades or cohesively taught.</p>
<p class=""homepagetext"">Emotional Imprint™ takes an innovative pedagogical approach to teaching emotional literacy by integrating it with the existing core curriculum. In an Emotional Imprint™ classroom, young people study the ways in which feelings play a role in learning and decision-making. Through academic work, students develop greater insight into their own and others’ emotions, improve their ability to read and respond to emotional communications of others, and internalize that insight. Our use of thought experiments as a teaching tool encourages students to deepen their understanding of self, other, and text.</p>
<p>This summer we began to put Emotional Imprint™ into action, thanks to an organization called <strong>Street Squash</strong>, a Harlem-based youth enrichment program that combines academic tutoring with squash instruction and college preparation. Street Squash invited us to design and implement a pilot project for their middle school students.</p>
<p>During the week-long program, we assigned students “future selves.” We turned their classroom into a microcosm of adult society, where each of them used their unique “emotional imprint” to imagine the emotional experience of people from different backgrounds, talk TO rather than AT friends from across imaginary divides, and imagine new ways to effect social change.</p>

</h3>
<p>Hello.<span> 
My name is Jordan Savage.  I was
born in Victoria, British Columbia, and grew up in Canmore, Alberta.  Ever since I was little I’ve had the desire
to become a pilot.  Over the years, I
have been influenced by my grandparents and a great uncle to pursue flying as a
career.  My first airplane ride was at
four years of age when my uncle took me up in a Cessna 172 to fly over the city
of Calgary.  I was wowed by the sight of
the mountains and the city.  He continued
to inspire my love for flying by supplying me with many flight simulator games
over the years.  My grandparents on my
father’s side of the family used to fly as stunt pilots, and helped me get
started by funding my private pilot ground schooling.  Presently, I am working at the Red Deer Regional
Airport as a dispatch loading, fueling and marshalling planes for Air Canada,
Buffalo Air and even the Ice Pilots. 
While I do this, I am also working online to finish my high school
classes, and taking a flying lesson here and there, as I can.  </span></p>
<p>Throughout the years, since I was five
years old there has been very challenging circumstances in my life.<span>  When I was five, my step-father was hit by a
drunk driver and sustained a severe brain injury.  My mother looked after my stepfather at home,
but the accident caused me to miss out on most of my kindergarten year, and I
had to take Grade One twice because things were so disruptive at home.  One year I had to spend most of the time
staying with my grandfather because things weren’t good at home.  One of the things that got put on hold a lot
at my house was my moving ahead smoothly in school, despite the fact that I enjoy
learning.  I particularly enjoy math,
physics, and anything science-related.  Since
the age of fourteen I have also worked after school to help my family with
finances.  And now I continue to help my
mother and younger sister with living expenses, while my stepfather no longer
lives with us. </span></p>
<p>How can I move ahead with my dream of
becoming a pilot?<span>  I can’t seem to work
hard enough or fast enough to earn the $10 000 needed to pay for private pilot
lessons.  </span></p><p><i><span>""The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely paper tigers. You can do anything you decide to do.

Education for Total Consciousness Vision</h3><b></b><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>
</p><p></p><p>The Centre Isalayam pour la Conscience Totale holds the belief that every human’s birthright is total knowledge, total 
awareness, and total happiness that comes from the right kind of 
education.  </p>Nowadays even <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20130821155343/http://purposed.org.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">educators do not agree</a> on the purpose of education.  Without a common aim, our knowledge has become fractured and as a society, our direction confused. <p></p><p>The real purpose of education is to impart wisdom (experienced knowledge) and to perfect the character. These two create total consciousness.<br/></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Education for Total Consciousness (ETC)</span> was designed by Swami Isa as a teaching methodology which can be used in any culture and any syllabus. <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">ETC</span> demonstrates the truth that the individual is a microcosm of the universe, and that one's thoughts and actions do have a real effect on the world, just as the world has an effect on one's self.<br/></p><p>In <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">ETC,</span> the student links the topic to
his or her own self. This is called objective and subjective learning. <br/></p><p>Object = anything in the outer world<br/></p><p>Subject = myself (my body, my emotions, my intellect, my ego, and Consciousness)</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/265295/files/20131217013715-etc_example3.jpg?1387273035"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p>For example, in ETC a story about a baby and a mother becomes a deeper lesson about our own emotions, and a geography lesson on rivers can become a lesson about our circulatory system.<br/></p><p>Every single lesson is designed so that the teacher becomes a master
of the subject; he or she is compelled to identify completely with the student
and topic, and the student likewise with the teacher and topic.  <br/></p><p></p><p>Students learning in the ETC format
will never do harm to others, or exploit nature, for personal gain, because
they have direct experience that harm created outside results on harming his or
her own self.  Children grow into
responsible, broad-minded, compassionate, confident, mindful and loving members of society. </p><p>The Centre Isalayam pour la Conscience Totale is happy to support the Isa Viswa
Vidyalayam, as part of a Swami Isa's larger vision
 to
uplift every human being from suffering and ignorance, through Education for Total Consciousness.  We share Swami Isa's 
ultimate dream to build a Universal University, an International Centre for Total Consciousness, 
to create an entirely new generation of humane human beings. </p><p></p><h3><b></b></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/265181/files/20131216233414-SwamiIsa-crop.jpg?1387265654"" src="""" style=""width: 197.299px; height: 247px;""/></p>

<b>Why Student Sponsorship?</b>
</h3><p>Many children in the locality of Isa Viswa Vidyalayam in Anayara, Trivandrum, Kerala, come from very humble environments and cannot afford the simple expenses of even a cup of milk or a bus to school. The school pays for the tuition, books, transportation, food and uniforms for these students. But
this is a hardship on the day-to-day running, especially in the context of skyrocketing
rates for electricity, water and transportation in Kerala State.  </p>
<p>The school has 25 students in need for the 2014-15 school year (June to March). Thus, we would like to raise $15,000 for them. 
The money goes to the school to pay for the expenses for the disadvantaged students, as well as the day-to-day operations, including teacher honorariums.  Any excess that we receive will be kept 
as a reserve for a residential school we want to help build in the lush tropical
jungle of rural Kerala. This school will accommodate more students in a harmonious
environment. <br/></p><p>We would be extremely grateful if any generous souls wish to donate more for the actual costs of
building the new residential school. <br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/263089/files/20131216015522-ResSchoolSketch-sm.jpg?1387187722"" src="""" style=""width: 409.333px; height: 307px;""/></p><span>In return for your heartwarming support
for the students and for this unique educational vision, your name will go on the honor roll of sponsors. Also, the sponsored child will write you a letter and make
you a drawing.  You will also get small gifts made by the students in
their classes and by other friends and supporters who love this vision. </span><span><br/><br/>If we don't reach our entire goal,
the amount we do receive will be given to the school for the most needy students. </span><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/263091/files/20131216015904-test.png?1387187944"" src="""" style=""width: 286.972px; height: 338px;""/></p><p></p><h3><b>The
Impact of Your Contribution</b></h3><p>
</p><p>Your support for these
disadvantaged students will make a profound difference in the lives of 25
families and their communities. The gift of total education is one that
radiates to the entire society. </p>
<p>Meet Swapna (featured on our campaign image). Her
father passed away when she was a toddler, and her mother is forced to care for
their family on her own.  In this society it is still quite hard for women
to make a living, especially if they are not well educated.  We have helped pay for Swapna's
education for the past several years, and the previously awkward child is now
a confident young woman. <span></span></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/265179/files/20131216233243-Letter-crop.jpg?1387265563"" src="""" style=""width: 326.651px; height: 250px;""/></p>For the past three years, generous individuals
and families have been able to sponsor needy students through our charity association. They love the feeling of knowing they make a difference in these students'
lives. Sponsors cherish their letters, photos and videos sent by the school, and watch the
students grow, year by year.  With 
these funds the school was able to support the most needy students and also to 
build a new hall.  It is a heartwarming feeling of 
satisfaction knowing that we all can make a difference in these 
students' lives.<p></p>

The statements in this campaign are its own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Isa Viswa Vidyalayam or Isa Viswa Prajnana Trust.The
 Isa Viswa Vidyalayam school, in Kerala, India, was founded by His Holiness Swami Isa in 1998.  Here, teachers use a special method of education Swamiji calls “Education for Total Consciousness” (ETC).  To help educate the expanding enrollment of disadvantaged students in ETC, the Centre Isalayam pour la Conscience Totale is conducting a fundraising campaign for the Isa Viswa Vidyaylayam school.  Any contribution makes a different in helping educate these students, covering
 the high cost of running the school, and fulfilling Swami’s vision of ETC.  We are passionate about this form of education because it provides the 
foundation for children to become truly humane human beings. Please give what you can to sponsor a student and help spread ETC for a better
 world!  The
Education for Total Consciousness Vision
The Centre Isalayam pour la Conscience Totale holds the belief that every human’s birthright is total knowledge, total 
awareness, and total happiness that comes from the right kind of 
education.  Nowadays even educators do not agree on the purpose of education.  Without a common aim, our knowledge has become fractured and as a society, our direction confused. The real purpose of education is to impart wisdom (experienced knowledge) and to perfect the character. These two create total consciousness.Education for Total Consciousness (ETC) was designed by Swami Isa as a teaching methodology which can be used in any culture and any syllabus. ETC demonstrates the truth that the individual is a microcosm of the universe, and that one's thoughts and actions do have a real effect on the world, just as the world has an effect on one's self.In ETC, the student links the topic to
his or her own self. This is called objective and subjective learning. Object = anything in the outer worldSubject = myself (my body, my emotions, my intellect, my ego, and Consciousness)For example, in ETC a story about a baby and a mother becomes a deeper lesson about our own emotions, and a geography lesson on rivers can become a lesson about our circulatory system.Every single lesson is designed so that the teacher becomes a master
of the subject; he or she is compelled to identify completely with the student
and topic, and the student likewise with the teacher and topic.  Students learning in the ETC format
will never do harm to others, or exploit nature, for personal gain, because
they have direct experience that harm created outside results on harming his or
her own self.  Children grow into
responsible, broad-minded, compassionate, confident, mindful and loving members of society. The Centre Isalayam pour la Conscience Totale is happy to support the Isa Viswa
Vidyalayam, as part of a Swami Isa's larger vision
 to
uplift every human being from suffering and ignorance, through Education for Total Consciousness.  We share Swami Isa's 
ultimate dream to build a Universal University, an International Centre for Total Consciousness, 
to create an entirely new generation of humane human beings. 
Isa Viswa Vidyalayam School
In the Isa Viswa Vidyalayam Swamiji's vision is put into practice. Classes are full of joy and inspiration! There is never a moment of dullness. The students are bright and fresh all day long.Each morning the students practice meditation and
chant vedas before class. They eat together and play together, learn 4 languages (Malayalam, English, Sanskrit and Hindi) in addition to
the normal State curriculum, create dances and skits to demonstrate their
lessons once a month, visit neighbors to give them trees--the list goes on of
amazing things these students do! And the best part is to see their joy in doing. No matter what it is, these students experience the happiness that comes from things just making sense both outwardly and inwardly.  ""I love my school.  I love my Gurumas [teachers].  I love myself and I love the world,"" says Kalyani, 3rd Grade.  What better demonstration of ETC is there? 
Why Student Sponsorship?
Many children in the locality of Isa Viswa Vidyalayam in Anayara, Trivandrum, Kerala, come from very humble environments and cannot afford the simple expenses of even a cup of milk or a bus to school. The school pays for the tuition, books, transportation, food and uniforms for these students. But
this is a hardship on the day-to-day running, especially in the context of skyrocketing
rates for electricity, water and transportation in Kerala State.  
The school has 25 students in need for the 2014-15 school year (June to March). Thus, we would like to raise $15,000 for them. 
The money goes to the school to pay for the expenses for the disadvantaged students, as well as the day-to-day operations, including teacher honorariums.  Any excess that we receive will be kept 
as a reserve for a residential school we want to help build in the lush tropical
jungle of rural Kerala. This school will accommodate more students in a harmonious
environment. We would be extremely grateful if any generous souls wish to donate more for the actual costs of
building the new residential school. In return for your heartwarming support
for the students and for this unique educational vision, your name will go on the honor roll of sponsors. Also, the sponsored child will write you a letter and make
you a drawing.  You will also get small gifts made by the students in
their classes and by other friends and supporters who love this vision. If we don't reach our entire goal,
the amount we do receive will be given to the school for the most needy students. The
Impact of Your Contribution
Your support for these
disadvantaged students will make a profound difference in the lives of 25
families and their communities. The gift of total education is one that
radiates to the entire society. 
Meet Swapna (featured on our campaign image). Her
father passed away when she was a toddler, and her mother is forced to care for
their family on her own.  In this society it is still quite hard for women
to make a living, especially if they are not well educated.  We have helped pay for Swapna's
education for the past several years, and the previously awkward child is now
a confident young woman. For the past three years, generous individuals
and families have been able to sponsor needy students through our charity association. They love the feeling of knowing they make a difference in these students'
lives. Sponsors cherish their letters, photos and videos sent by the school, and watch the
students grow, year by year.  With 
these funds the school was able to support the most needy students and also to 
build a new hall.  It is a heartwarming feeling of 
satisfaction knowing that we all can make a difference in these 
students' lives.

<p><b>Meet Patti!</b></p>
<p>If
you have been following Patti Drews, you know that this amazing lady is
recovering nicely from her extensive back surgery that was performed in May.
Patti is mobile and is getting ready to attend Union Theological Seminary in
New York City this fall. Union is one of the most prestigious and progressive seminaries
in the world, and, of course, they want Patti!</p>
<p><b>A Bit of History</b></p>
<p>Patti
graduated from Western Washington University, Fairhaven College in June of 2011
with a degree in Social Advocacy, as well as minors in both Philosophy and
Religion.  Patti had planned to work following her
graduation from WWU. 
Unfortunately, her acute back condition prevented her from using her
education and moving back into the workforce. Her surgery, done at University of Washington
Harborview Medical Center in Seattle WA, has an extended recovery period. She
will be attending the Seminary for part of her first year as a disabled
student.  All who know Patti know she has
often held 2-3 jobs at a time, so her inability to work hard to reach her goals
has been very challenging and humbling.  </p>
<p>Patti’s back problems were the result of a
childhood accident. At age ten she fell through a barn loft and was seriously
injured, resulting in a lifetime of pain and chronic health issues. This challenge

with struggle. Ironically it was also this misfortune that gave way to
opportunity when an acute bout with her back prompted her to return to school. Patti’s own circumstances have fueled her passion for helping others
in need, especially those who face misfortune or are disadvantaged. Everyone
who knows Patti realizes how deeply she is affected by those in adverse

awarding  admission and financial assistance.</p>
<p>Patti graduated from Western Washington University at age
48. Unfortunately her tremendous pain during this time precluded any type of

<p><b>The Need</b></p>
<p>Although Patti, through diligent work, has received financial assistance, her upcoming additional costs

Patti needs a private studio apartment at Union. This

exceeds the allocated amount by nearly $200.00 per month.  Moving costs must also be considered. Together,
as friends, family, and supporters of those worthy and willing to advance

If
you have been following Patti Drews, you know that this amazing lady is
recovering nicely from her extensive back surgery that was performed in May.
Patti is mobile and is getting ready to attend Union Theological Seminary in
New York City this fall. Union is one of the most prestigious and progressive seminaries
in the world, and, of course, they want Patti!
A Bit of History
Patti
graduated from Western Washington University, Fairhaven College in June of 2011
with a degree in Social Advocacy, as well as minors in both Philosophy and
Religion.  Patti had planned to work following her
graduation from WWU. 
Unfortunately, her acute back condition prevented her from using her
education and moving back into the workforce. Her surgery, done at University of Washington
Harborview Medical Center in Seattle WA, has an extended recovery period. She
will be attending the Seminary for part of her first year as a disabled
student.  All who know Patti know she has
often held 2-3 jobs at a time, so her inability to work hard to reach her goals
has been very challenging and humbling.  
Patti’s back problems were the result of a
childhood accident. At age ten she fell through a barn loft and was seriously
injured, resulting in a lifetime of pain and chronic health issues. This challenge
coupled with being a single parent made Patti  very acquainted
with struggle. Ironically it was also this misfortune that gave way to
opportunity when an acute bout with her back prompted her to return to school. Patti’s own circumstances have fueled her passion for helping others
in need, especially those who face misfortune or are disadvantaged. Everyone
who knows Patti realizes how deeply she is affected by those in adverse
situations. It is
these incredible personal qualities, and her outstanding academic
skills, that world renowned Union Theological Seminary found so worthy of
awarding  admission and financial assistance.
Patti graduated from Western Washington University at age
48. Unfortunately her tremendous pain during this time precluded any type of
celebration. Many of us who cheered her on were not even aware of her

<h3>Why I Want To Study In Germany</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Casey Paulus, I'm a senior at Theodore Roosevelt high school and I have a passion for German.</p>
<p>I traveled to Germany for our school's German-American exchange, for a month last summer with my class. A month in Germany didn't feel long enough! Through this trip we traveled across Germany, attended school and lived with a host family for three weeks, experiencing real German culture. The time that I spent in Germany was unforgettable! But there was one thing that bugged me the entire time I was in Germany and that was that I'm not fluent in the language. My desire is to be able to study abroad for a year in Germany and become fluent. My ultimate long term goal is to live and work in Germany!  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The money that is made from this video will be used to cover my expenses for the organization, my plane ticket and medical insurance.</p>
<p>For helping me reach my goal, I would like to send you a variety of German goods! Anything from postcards to candies!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>
<strong>The</strong> Impact</h2>
<p>From the moment I returned from the exchange, it was my goal to somehow go back to Germany, become fluent in German and eventually live in Germany. Because of the exchange that I was in, my exchange partner and I became best friends! We've promised each other that we would see each other again but next time, my German would be better. Saying goodbye to her and her family was the toughest goodbye I've ever had to make. Throughout my senior year, I've dedicated my time to studying Geman, I even became the Vice-President of our school's German club! I have also become very close with my German teacher and she recommended that I take part in a GAP Year and study abroad! </p>
<p>I'm determined to make this goal of studying abroad! Once I return I plan to attend college and major in either graphic design or Global studies and minor in German!</p>

<p><b>Fund a Nicaraguan
Medical student, Wendy Rodriguez!  </b></p>
<p>Hello!  My name is
Wendy Ingram and I have recently returned from a medical mission trip to
Jiquilillo, Nicaragua with the Arizona-based group H.E.R.O. (<a href=""http://heroefforts.org/nicaragua-2013/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Humanitarian Efforts Reaching Out</a>).  Jiquilillo is a
small rural village near a protected estuary with more than 20 small villages
surrounding it.  HERO has now completed
two medical missions providing desperately needed medical, dental, and
veterinary care in 2013 and 2014.  Each
time we have gone, there have been a number of passionate <b>Nicaraguan medical
students</b> who have taken it upon themselves to join us in providing care to
these under-served communities.  Without
these students’ dedication, translation, and rapport with the local
communities, HERO would have an incredibly hard time.  This year we were lucky enough to have <i>seven</i>
outstanding 3<sup>rd</sup> year Medical students from Leon, Nicaragua join
us.  Their maturity, consideration, and
passion for medicine was integral to our mission, not to mention inspiring to
see in the local doctors of tomorrow.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, not all of these incredible medical students
can afford to be full time students, and some are even supporting their
families at the same time.  It would be a
tragedy if these promising young students had to give up their dreams to be
doctors.  We at HERO have decided to
support as many of these students as we can who show commitment to their
studies, passion for medicine, and a dedication to continuing to serve rural,
impoverished communities in Nicaragua. 
Please help us in supporting one of these fantastic students, Wendy
Rodriguez.  </p>
<p>Medical School tuition is <b>only $3000 a year</b>.  Any amount you can contribute to this worthy cause will be greatly
appreciated!  Together, we can make sure
that Nicaraguan students, dedicated to providing services to rural populations,
can learn medicine and bring the much needed regular care to the communities
that need it most.  </p>
<p><b>HERO thanks you! </b></p>
<p>One of the most gratifying aspects of providing care to
these communities is seeing the smiles on the faces of the Nicaraguan
people.  Many of the communities we
visited these last two years had never received medical care before.  Our doctors, nurses, and dentists addressed
illnesses and injuries that had been suffered with for years, or even
decades.  Photographs of our North
American and Nicaraguan team at work, face to face with the men, women, and
children of these communities are heart-wrenchingly beautiful.  We will print and mail you a stunning photo
from one of our trips if you pledge $20 or more. <br/></p><p>Even if you can't contribute financially, please share our campaign on your social networks so that we can provide support to these incredible medical students.  <br/></p><p></p></div>","Fund a Nicaraguan

Rodriguez.  
Medical School tuition is only $3000 a year.  Any amount you can contribute to this worthy cause will be greatly
appreciated!  Together, we can make sure
that Nicaraguan students, dedicated to providing services to rural populations,
can learn medicine and bring the much needed regular care to the communities
that need it most.  
HERO thanks you! 
One of the most gratifying aspects of providing care to
these communities is seeing the smiles on the faces of the Nicaraguan
people.  Many of the communities we
visited these last two years had never received medical care before.  Our doctors, nurses, and dentists addressed
illnesses and injuries that had been suffered with for years, or even
decades.  Photographs of our North
American and Nicaraguan team at work, face to face with the men, women, and
children of these communities are heart-wrenchingly beautiful.  We will print and mail you a stunning photo
from one of our trips if you pledge $20 or more. Even if you can't contribute financially, please share our campaign on your social networks so that we can provide support to these incredible medical students.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>We have already done all the

The typical cost of a trade show booth ranges from $800-$3,500 for <u>display
equipment rental only</u>. Then additional sponsorship dues can range from
$10,000 - $100,000 to participate in a trade show event or convention. Due to
the nature of being entirely non-profit 501(c) organizations, we’ve worked very
hard to keep the cost as low as possible in order to encourage high

<li>Attending the YWAM discipleship School will cost the two of us about $15,000.  This includes the six month school, room &amp; board, transportation, a missions trip during the school and about $50.00 a month each for unplanned expenses.</li>
<li>Ideally, Nebojsa and I will be able to attend the school together; I believe that is God's will,  however, it is my priority that Nebojsa get trained for ministry.  In the event that we do not raise all the funds needed for both of us, Nebojsa will attend the class starting this fall.  Any funds left will be set aside while I continue to raise enough for me to enter a different class.  </li>
<li>Any funds over and above what is needed for the school will be used to support us in future ministry endeavors, as EVERYONE in YWAM must obtain their own support. </li>
</ul><h3>What You Get</h3><ul>
<li>I am in the process of doing a final edit on my book, ""<b>No Mere Coincidences</b>, <i>a journey of faith</i>""  an account of my 4,000 mile journey where I traveled from Minneapolis to Washington DC to Florida and then to Peoria, IL--- totally on faith, ministering to anyone God put in my path; asking for nothing but water to drink and a place to set my tent at night. </li>
<li>for all donations over $25.00 I will email a pre-published, PDF copy of the book. <br/>
</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><ul>
<li>Imagine: getting to Heaven and having people that you never met coming to you, thanking you for your part in them getting to heaven.  When you donate to get us to YWAM school, YOU have a part in every person we reach with the gospel.  For every young person I train because of you, YOU have a part in every person they reach for Christ. <br/>
</li>

</ul><p></p><p>And that's all there is to it.</p></div>","My name is Dennis Mixer.  I am an ordained minister and founder of Ministry of the Sheep International  I am also a U.S. Army vet, a veteran of Desert Storm and was a Police Officer & Emergency Medical Technician in Missouri for 17 years.    In 2007, After years in Law enforcement, God called me into ministry.  Since that time I have spent six months working at an orphanage in Honduras, Started Ministry of the Sheep, did a 4,000 mile Journey of faith, ministered to poor, homeless and desolate on the streets of Atlanta, GA and, for the past 3 1/2 years, cared for my mother who has Alzheimer's.  All of this has been done on faith.  As the current season seems to be coming to an end, I feel that God is leading me to begin training young people for ministry and missions by partnering with Youth With a Mission(YWAM).In order to partner with YWAM, I must first go through their basic Discipleship Training School and I must also be self-supported.  I also mentor a young man, Nebojsa Dusanic, who desires to attend the Discipleship Training.  Nebojsa was born in Germany and has a heart for spreading the Gospel in Germany.  For this reason we have chosen the YWAM school in Hurlach, Germany which starts in September of this year.  What We Need
Attending the YWAM discipleship School will cost the two of us about $15,000.  This includes the six month school, room & board, transportation, a missions trip during the school and about $50.00 a month each for unplanned expenses.
Ideally, Nebojsa and I will be able to attend the school together; I believe that is God's will,  however, it is my priority that Nebojsa get trained for ministry.  In the event that we do not raise all the funds needed for both of us, Nebojsa will attend the class starting this fall.  Any funds left will be set aside while I continue to raise enough for me to enter a different class.  
Any funds over and above what is needed for the school will be used to support us in future ministry endeavors, as EVERYONE in YWAM must obtain their own support. 
What You Get
I am in the process of doing a final edit on my book, ""No Mere Coincidences, a journey of faith""  an account of my 4,000 mile journey where I traveled from Minneapolis to Washington DC to Florida and then to Peoria, IL--- totally on faith, ministering to anyone God put in my path; asking for nothing but water to drink and a place to set my tent at night. 
for all donations over $25.00 I will email a pre-published, PDF copy of the book. 

The Impact
Imagine: getting to Heaven and having people that you never met coming to you, thanking you for your part in them getting to heaven.  When you donate to get us to YWAM school, YOU have a part in every person we reach with the gospel.  For every young person I train because of you, YOU have a part in every person they reach for Christ. 

Imagine: someone that is reached with the gospel, because YOU donated, became the next great evangelist, leading thousands to Christ.

Imagine, churches, orphanages, feeding centers...being started by someone who was reached with the Gospel by someone that was reached by someone WE ministered to, because YOU donated.
Donating to get us to YWAM school doesn't just have a six month effect, it will have an Impact for eternity. 

Other Ways You Can HelpSome people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:
Pray for us!  Pray that we raise the funds we need.  Pray that God will work in our lives and that we be vessels, pouring out the Holy Spirit where ever we go.
Make some noise about our campaign!  Use the share tools to spread word to your friends, family and churches.
Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools too!

<div>I recently obtained my teaching credential for the state of California and my Master's of Education. I am a new teacher and just got hired to teach 3rd grade this coming August! I could not be more thrilled. I am working at Title I school, where all of my 25 future students are on free breakfast in the classroom and free lunch. They come from very diverse backgrounds. My classroom for the year is in a trailer near the cafeteria. We have desks and chairs for the students but we could use your donations to help gain supplies to help us learn and succeed for the year! Being a new teacher, I am transforming this classroom from nothing to something, and with your help, we can access and utilize these supplies for reading, writing, art, English language development, science, P.E, music, math, and social studies. Help us learn and grow! </div>
<div>A detailed supply and price list is below (at the end of this paragraph). These are the supplies I've found that will help us in what we want to learn for this year. It stems from the basics: pencils and hand sanitizer, to folders that will help the students organize their homework for the year.  If you are unable to donate, you can still help by sharing this campaign with others. Also, feel free to donate supplies that you may have sitting around the house! These basic necessities will provide so much to these students in need. You will not only be helping the students write, draw and solve problems for the year, but also changing lives by supporting these students on their journey as lifelong learners. </div>

</h3><div style="""">
<p>As kids, many of us were fortunate enough to enjoy a nice playground where we could play with our childhood friends. Many of us have fond childhood memories of spending time at the playground, and we hope to ensure that the children of Cleveland, Tennessee can also have a great place to make memories. The town of Cleveland, Tennessee currently has a playground at its community center where the children of the town can play, but it is in need of some improvements and new equipment. <br/></p>
<p>As a student-led group from the University of Tennessee, our team embodies the term ""Volunteer,"" and because of this, we aim to assist this community by raising the money to help them upgrade their community playground. With your donations, this community will be able to purchase quality, up-to-date playground equipment for their community playground.</p>

as we can to the improvement of this playground!<br/><br/>The $1,100 that 
we are raising will fund the purchase of baby seats for the swing set, 
the purchase of mulch to level out the playground area, and the 
construction of a school bus stop beside the playground for the 
children. No matter if we meet our financial goal or not, all funds 
raised will go toward the improvement of this park. <br/><br/>By donating,
 you will have the personal satisfaction of contributing to the lives of
 others, but you will also earn perks with your donation, depending on

</div></div>","Short Summary 
The JUMP! Project (Just Us Moms Performing) is a nine-month project to empower young single moms to conceptualize, write, and produce a theatrical piece that tells their own stories. Throughout the project, a film crew is documenting the people, the project, and the process.
Through performances and the documentary, these young moms can control their own narrative as well as challenge the mainstream social and political views of what it means to be a young single mom.
   What We Need & What You Get We need to cover costs for workshop, theater, and film production costs, and paying the artists and moms for all their hard work. Because this project is nine months long, we're setting monthly goals to help us get there.
To keep things going, we need to raise $5,000 in December to cover equipment costs that the project has already incurred.
We want to recognize all levels of support:

$25 & up - your name listed on the web site as a supporter

$100 & up - your name listed in the end credits of the documentary as a supporter

$250 & up - your name listed on the playbill as a supporter
$500 & up - two free tickets to the show
$1,000 - your name listed as a project sponsor on all promotional materials
$5,000 & up - your name listed as a producer on the documentary

  The Impact 

The phrase “welfare mom” evokes images of lazy, uneducated, loose women who are bent on having as many babies as they can to “milk the system.” In reality, many cannot afford the milk they need to feed their children.
In Kentucky, unmarried mothers are required to volunteer or work 20 hours per week and be enrolled in school in order to have access to Kentucky Transitional Assistance Program and childcare assistance. Recent budget cuts left 15,000 families in Kentucky without the childcare assistance that they depend on. The work requirement for childcare assistance leaves many young moms struggling to graduate from high school on time; when they lose eligibility for childcare assistance at 20, it endangers their ability to complete their education.
With all of the stresses of being a student, a worker, and a single mom, there is too often not enough time for these young moms to be creative, and so their stories are silenced. Historically, this has been a literal silence, as the girls who “got into trouble” were sent away to hide a shameful secret from the community. But there continues a metaphorical silence, as outsiders from the media impose a narrative on these young moms’ lives rather than tell the truth of their experiences.
The JUMP! Project will end this silence.


    Challenges Making a documentary is time-consuming and expensive. The start-up costs have been well into the thousands, and production costs are much, much higher.
Theater production is also expensive, not only for the space, but also for the technical support and insurance.
The moms and artists are spending many hours each month to make this project happen. Artists should be paid a fair wage for their work.

    Other Ways You Can Help No matter where you live, please share our project with your social media circles using the Indiegogo share tools. You can also share your words of encouragement on Indiegogo, our web site, twitter, or Facebook.
If you're local:
Make donations for the
     workshops and rehearsals, like snacks and drinks for the kids (we
     provide childcare), gas cards, bus tickets, art supplies, or pens.
Purchase a wish list item from our list on Pinterest. You can send or drop off items at Step by Step. Be sure to mention that your donation is for the JUMP! Project.
Volunteer. We can use a few
     volunteers for childcare, giving rides to the moms, and later on, to help
     with the theater performances.

you that hurts, there’s nowhere for a person suffering from mental disorders to
point to. Even worse, is the expectation to act normally, to stuff those
feelings down - to ‘just get over it.’ We wouldn’t demand that a person missing
a leg run a race, so why should we demand that a person whose mind is hurting
continue to act and react the way we expect them to? Why should we invalidate
their prison, simply because it is one we cannot see? The great thing about the mind is that mental illness is not a permanent place as you will discover in this book.</p><p></p>

Battling psychological and emotional obstacles, as well as being  socially awkward from as young as 5, I didn’t think there would ever be a

without the use of medications; that there should be a more effective way to
alter our view of ourselves and our life than what we have been exposed to.
Inspired by the lives and stories of the countless persons I have taught,
coached, and reached out to, I realized that this book held a story that was
bigger than myself, one that could be used to help the persons that I could not
physically reach out to.</p>
<p>It is with this in mind that I have decided to take this
project to Indiegogo, in the hopes that I might gain the $9,700 worth funding

</ul></div>","Join BHeart in raising $11,000 by June 15 to support a group* of Bosnian and Herzegovinian women who were victims of sexual violence during the 92-95 war. The funds will support the education of their children and cover the costs of the counseling organization that helps the victims deal with trauma and social stigmatization.
The conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&H) ended in 1995, but the hardship is not over for the tens of thousands of women and girls who were victims of violence and rape. 
While the rapists walk free, many people refuse either to believe or accept what happened. This denial and social stigmatization have compounded their burden of shame and humiliation. Living on the margins of society, they lack financial stability and struggle to provide education for their children.Such is the group of women in eastern B&H whom we would like to help. Jasmina is one of these women. She and her husband have three children who have not been told of their mother's painful past. One is a child with special needs. The eldest son interrupted his university studies due to the lack of funds as both of his parents are unemployed. Jasmina's greatest wish is that her children have better lives than their mother. 


 
My dear friend,

Although we have not met, every time I write to you I feel the warmth of friendship... Even now, as I write this, I am crying,  and I don't know why. Women, victims of war, need to be in contact with and surrounded by friends. I feel that all of you far away are true friends. I thank God that people like you exist and do not allow evil to win. I pray from the bottom of my heart that such evil never happens anywhere again"" – an excerpt    from a letter to BHeart written by a rape victim.

 

 
Please act now and help Jasmina and other women war victims and their children! Your generosity will make a crucial difference in their everyday lives. The funds raised will:
 



Support their children’s education for one school
year through a monthly stipend that will pay for books, school transport and
meals, and if our donations are generous enough, buy them sports gear and
computers. 
Fund the counseling organization that not only provides a meeting place where the women feel safe, can
discuss their traumas and seek professional counsel, but also fights for their
rights. 
Buy materials for making handicrafts, which provide
an important income, as well as a sense of purpose and self-respect. 




BHeart is a volunteer organization that focuses on issues and supports projects that are important for Bosnian and Herzegovinian women and their families. 
BHeart members were inspired by the Bosnian director Jasmila Žbanić’s film,""For Those Who Can Tell No Tales”, which exposes the denial of crimes against women in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The screening of the film and a fundraiser will be organized by BHeart on May 31st in Washington DC.

All donations are tax deductible. The receipts will be provided to donors at the end of the campaign. The project will be implemented through our local partner, the  Bosana Foundation.

 

* To protect the privacy of these women and their children, we cannot reveal their names and their counseling organization.

In speaking with the children, we found they have experienced everything from physical and sexual violence, to being kicked out of their homes after a parent has decided there are too many children under one roof, or to being orphaned after HIV/AIDS took the life of a loved one.

<p style=""margin-left: 90px;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.darksky.org/assets/media/LosingTheDarkPOSTER_sm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><em>Losing the Dark</em> is 6.5-minute public service announcement that is being distributed free of charge as a high-definition flat screen video for your use; use in science centers, classrooms, and streaming from the Web; and for both traditional and full dome digital planetarium theaters.</p>
<p>Light pollution is a worldwide problem that needs a worldwide solution. <em>Losing the Dark</em> explains how light pollution impacts wildlife, wastes energy, reduces visibility, threatens human health, and more. It also offers simple solutions that anyone can do, reminding us all that that it is not too late to save the nighttime environment.</p>
<p>However, <em>Losing the Dark </em>currently exists only in English and we want everyone to have access to its message. With your help we will raise the necessary funds to produce translated versions for people worldwide. We are currently working with volunteers that can provide translation and narration services. When those are ready we need the funds to pay our production company to combine the new narrations with the show’s visuals and music, producing a final, translated version ready for the world to see.</p>
<p>This is an elaborate process, as the show is freely available in some 23 different formats ranging from domed planetarium versions to flat screen HD.</p>
<p>Translations for Dutch, French, German, Greek, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin and Spanish will soon be finished. We have also had requests for: Cantonese, Hebrew, Polish, Portuguese, Russian and others. We will provide as many language versions as we can based on demand and funding. </p>
<p>If translated, it is estimated that the PSA could be seen by 250,000 viewers annually worldwide, raising awareness of dark sky preservation globally.</p>
<p>With your help we will be able to complete all of these translations so that any planetarium or school can include the PSA in their regular educational program</p>
<p>You can see <em>Losing the Dark</em> on IDA's YouTube Channel <a href=""http://youtu.be/dd82jaztFIo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://youtu.be/dd82jaztFIo</a></p>
<p>Teachers, planetarium theater operators and anyone interested in spreading the word about light pollution can freely download the show in a variety of formats. With your help we will complete the translations so that they can all hear the message.

<p>Enjoy the show and thank you for your support.</p>
<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p>IDA started work on the PSA over a year ago during very difficult financial times. With the support of donors, we were finally able to raise the $20,000 to cover the cost to produce the English version at the end of 2012. Now we need your help to make the international versions.</p>
<p>We continue to look for funding from many different sources but are hoping that the indiegogo community will see the benefit of getting this program into the hands of anyone in the world. Donating a little or as much as you would like, will spread this film across the globe.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I have been invited to spend my senior year abroad at the University of Dance and Circus in Stockholm, Sweden! This is the opportunity of a life time for me as a performer and the school is creating this exchange program specifically for me! I am beyond excited and honored that I have been chosen for this opportunity. Why me? They like the way I think, the way I juggle, and how I put the two together. </p>
<p>Juggling is what I live for, my love, my passion, and hopefully my career. Participating in this program is the next step for me to be able to make my dream a reality. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>Stockholm is one of the most expensive cities in the world, not to mention transportation back and forth across the pond. I will have to find my own flat and pay for living expences as well as for school. I am holding four shows to raise money for this very purpose but if you are unable to make it to Louisville, KY for those than this is another way you could help.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Modern circus is thriving in europe. This experience would not only give me a fantastic education in dance, theatre, acrobatics, and an expansion of my juggling but will also alow me to get a foot in the door into european circus. </p>
</div>

<p><strong>Her name is Jacquelin Motta and she is a victim and SURVIVOR of domestic abuse.  Jacquelin arrived in this country from the Dominican Republic speaking no English.  Since that time she became a US citizen, a teacher in the New York Public School System and a caretaker of her two children, ages 5 and 8.  When Jacquelin got married in 1999 it was for better or for worse.  She had no idea the impact of the “for worse” would have on her.  In her own words Jacquelin confesses to being sexually assaulted by her estranged husband who also physically and psychologically abused her.   She has had to deal with multiple rapes as well as the financial and emotional strain of her estranged husband’s gambling and alcohol addictions.  A diagnosis of PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder) led to her losing temporary custody of her little girls to the perpetrator of her abuse.  After many years of traumatizing abuse Jacquelin found the strength to go back to school with one goal in mind; to create a better life for her two daughters and take them away from the unhealthy environment they were forced to live in.  Hiding from her estranged husband as a fugitive she secretly attended law classes at St John’s University in Queens, NY (without any sort of marital support).  Since being separated from her estranged husband in 2010 Jacquelin has completed a LL.M law degree from St. Johns and dreams of one day as a future lawyer being able to champion the cause of women and children victims of domestic violence.    Right now that is only a far-reaching dream.  Her current reality is plagued with unemployment, no financial resources and strapped with marital obligations she cannot pay. She is dealing with the hardships of a pending divorce and stands in jeopardy of losing her home in the interim.  As bad as that all appears the worst of it doesn’t compare with losing custody of her children.  Jacquelin’s greatest fear is that her children will suffer the same fate she has at the hands of her perpetrator.  In their father’s custody they are already showing serious signs of dysfunction and neglect. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Jacquelin Motta is in jeopardy of losing her children permanently and would like to raise funds to pay for a court-required forensic evaluation to regain custody of her children.  She also would like to be able to afford proper legal representation in her custody case.  She needs minimally $10,000 for legal fees to pay for the court-required forensic evaluation and to hire a decent lawyer who can help her obtain custody of her children.  The magnitude of the public’s help would be tremendous.  It would allow Jacquelin to rescue her daughters from potentially emotional and bodily harm.  Once she has full custody of her children and they are safe she can then focus on making a better life for the three of them.  Your contributions would contribute to her survival and ultimately enable her to contribute her time, efforts and legal know-how to advocating for women and children of domestic violence with support groups and legal representation.  Whatever funds are raised will go toward her legal fees.  Domestic abuse hurts everyone! Each survivor has an obligation to reach and teach others how to survive.  Jacquelin’s life has been forever changed yet that pain will one day turn another victims pain into joy… If you cannot contribute financially than pray.  She needs all the help she can get.  Help spread Jacquelin’s story so another women does not too have to suffer in silence.  Remember to use the Indiegogo share tools!</strong></p>

<h3>From City Streets... </h3>
<p>The MylifE Foundation has been working with youth on the city streets for ten years. In that time they have found that a very large number of youth ending up carrying the label of ""street child"" and all the pain that goes with it, are coming from rural areas in the country believing that the city holds all the opportunities and recognition they seek. The sad reality is that many of these youth end up being disheartened and their talents and gift go unnoticed. </p>
<h3>...to Rural South Africa</h3>
<p>The MylifE Foundation went on a journey through the rural Eastern Cape and into the even more rural Transkei to find out what the impact of youth migration is having in rural communities and what can be done to prevent this from happening. </p>
<p>What was discovered was not surprising but shocking nonetheless. The number of youth in rural communities is dropping radically, leaving the very old to take care of the very young. The elders have no-one to share their skills with and the little ones are missing a generation of mentors. </p>
<p>There is a dire need for youth development and continued, sustainable support within these rural communities, giving the youth a platform to learn new skills, create a sustainable community oriented economy and above all, feel empowered to mentor the small children and one day, teach them their skills. </p>
<h3>The Solutions: Training-the-Trainer | Being the Village</h3>
<p>Our goal is to create a space for skills development programs that invite our elders to train our youth who in turn pay-it-forward and mentor our young children. </p>
<p>We have developed a close relationship with the good people at the local rural primary school and have pledged to incorporate our programs into the school's curricular and extra-curricular programs. Already we have teachers eager to participate and the full backing and support of the headmaster and the community.</p>
<p>This brings us to the next solution: creating the Village. We have all heard the expression, ""It takes a village to raise a child"" but how often have we realised that WE are that village? And how often do we realise that we CAN make a difference where the system is incapable of providing a sustainable solution?</p>
<p>The MylifE journey has led them to connect with pro-active community members and organizations within Hogsback and the surrounding Eastern Cape.</p>
<p>HeArt Space Hogsback is a grass-roots commUnity initiative that offers space and time for skill sharing and micro enterprise in areas of - </p>

<p>* Art and Craft</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Immediate impact is already being seen in the openess and excitement of the local children and youth when we interact with them: there is an eagerness to experience something new, to feel recognized, to be acknowledged and to feel appreciated. </p>
<p>The biggest impact will be on the local rural primary school. The children here are desperate of skill development, community recognition and self-sustainabilty.</p>
<p>In time we hope to see the local art and craft shop at HeArt Space filled with the creations made by our local youth - a thriving micro-enterprise that celebrates the next generation. Who know where to from there - the sky is the limit! </p>

</div></div>","From City Streets... 
The MylifE Foundation has been working with youth on the city streets for ten years. In that time they have found that a very large number of youth ending up carrying the label of ""street child"" and all the pain that goes with it, are coming from rural areas in the country believing that the city holds all the opportunities and recognition they seek. The sad reality is that many of these youth end up being disheartened and their talents and gift go unnoticed. 
...to Rural South Africa
The MylifE Foundation went on a journey through the rural Eastern Cape and into the even more rural Transkei to find out what the impact of youth migration is having in rural communities and what can be done to prevent this from happening. 
What was discovered was not surprising but shocking nonetheless. The number of youth in rural communities is dropping radically, leaving the very old to take care of the very young. The elders have no-one to share their skills with and the little ones are missing a generation of mentors. 
There is a dire need for youth development and continued, sustainable support within these rural communities, giving the youth a platform to learn new skills, create a sustainable community oriented economy and above all, feel empowered to mentor the small children and one day, teach them their skills. 
The Solutions: Training-the-Trainer | Being the Village
Our goal is to create a space for skills development programs that invite our elders to train our youth who in turn pay-it-forward and mentor our young children. 
We have developed a close relationship with the good people at the local rural primary school and have pledged to incorporate our programs into the school's curricular and extra-curricular programs. Already we have teachers eager to participate and the full backing and support of the headmaster and the community.
This brings us to the next solution: creating the Village. We have all heard the expression, ""It takes a village to raise a child"" but how often have we realised that WE are that village? And how often do we realise that we CAN make a difference where the system is incapable of providing a sustainable solution?
The MylifE journey has led them to connect with pro-active community members and organizations within Hogsback and the surrounding Eastern Cape.
HeArt Space Hogsback is a grass-roots commUnity initiative that offers space and time for skill sharing and micro enterprise in areas of - 
* Volunteering
* Art and Craft
* Organic Food Production
* Moving toward sustainable, off-the-grid living
* Holistic Wellbeing
MylifE and HeArt Space have collaborated to intitiate our.... 


Current Skill Development Project: The Hearts & Hands Needle Craft Project
We have the commitment of two teachers from Crabbush Primary School and 2 female youth from a neighbouring village called Auckland who have pledged to attend the first level Crochet Course in our ever-evolving needle work training program. 
In turn, they will pay-it-forward and teach the children at the school how to crochet.

<h3>Falashay Here!</h3>
<p>Most of you who will donate to this campaign know me already, but for those of you who know nothing about me here are a few facts about me:</p>
<p>I graduated from DePaul University in Chicago, IL with a BFA in Acting in June of 2009. There I also had an undeclared minor in Arabic. Three days after gratuation, I went to live in Morocco for nearly two months to better study Arabic. After my return to the states I came back to acting and have been apart of a wonderful play call <em>A Twist of Water </em>that will be going to Off-Broadway this fall. </p>
<p>Recently, I realized that there are a few things that I really want from life and many things that I'd like to learn. One of those things is I want to become fluent in Arabic and learn more about Arab culture. I have found a few wonderful graduate programs that I am dying to apply to, however, there is one little obstacle; <strong>I never recieved my Undergraduate diploma!</strong> I need that and my officail transcrpt in order to apply to graduate school. Since I took the Morocco trip abroad with my school, they added on an extra $1,1000 as a program fee the summer after I gratuated. I have tried and failed to save up the money to pay them off many times. Your contribution will not only help me finally see that piece of paper that says I graduated from College Cum Laude, but it will also help me be able to apply to gratuate school for the fall of 2013!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I know to some $1,100 is chump change and wouldn't make much differnece in their life. To me it means finally getting to touch my diploma. It means that I can further my education. It means that I'll be able to have more job opportunities once I further myself by doing a Master's degree. The extra $200 is for the Indigogo and paypal fees for using the service. </p>
<p><strong>Here's what you will get for helping:</strong></p>
<p>Aside from my love there are some perks for helping me out!</p>
<ul>
<li>If you give $5 I will shout you out on my Facebook and Twitter pages!</li>
<li>If you give $25 I will write you a personal email or letter of thanks! This will require either your email or mailing address. Plus the Facebook shout out! </li>
<li>If you give $50 I will give you all of the above, plus a personalized Name card in Arabic calligraphy! This is a really cool perk because you'll get to see what your name looks like in Arabic! This will also require an address.</li>
<li>If you're feeling super generous and want to give $500 then you'll get all of the above perks as well as dinner with me and my diploma!</li>
</ul>
<p>If I reach my goal and somehow surpass it, the additional money will go towards paying off the copious amounts of hospital bills that I have from my Open heart surgery in 2008 and breast lump removal back in July of this year. So if you see that I've reached my goal please don't let that discourage you from still donating if you haven't! This campaign will end on my birthday! I can think of no better present that anyone could give to me!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>For some I know that financial contributions may not be possible and that's okay! I would just like to ask for your continued support and prayers! Please keep in mind, you don't have to claim a perk to donate any dollar can help and will result in hugs!</p>

<p>Music With A Message For Kids, Inc. is dedicated to bringing FREE educational and motivational music programs to kids in need at Elementary-Middle Schools, Libraries, Youth Organizations, Native American Reservations, and Military bases all over the  U.S.</p>
<p>We are a 501 (c)(3) Non Profit started in 2006 as a response to the need for educational and motivational programs in hurricane damaged New Orleans. We've since been back to that area 4 different times to encourage and motivate kids to get involved in helping their neighbors and in the rebuilding of their Community. In our brief 4 years of existence, we've already provided our service to well over 70,000 kids in 254 Elementary-Middle Schools, Libraries, Youth Organizations and Military Bases in 8 different states, including Michigan, Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Louisiana. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>2. Project Summary</strong></p>
<p>Music With A Message For Kid's purpose in this project is to bring FREE Educational and Motivational music assemblies on Reading/Literacy, Character-anti bullying, and/or Health-Nutrition to inner city kids in at least 80 Elementary Schools in 10 major U.S. cities (Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Los Angeles, New York, Phoenix, and San Francisco), over the next 2 school years. The funds from this campaign will be used exclusively to cover 50% of the administrative and production costs (travel-artist fees, etc) needed to perform our services.. Through these efforts, we will be effective in educating and motivating, in a positive way, almost 25,000 kids, teachers and parents in the areas of most need.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>3. Needs Statement</strong></p>
<p>The issues we cover have never been more necessary. Reading levels and literacy rates in today's 1st-6th grade students are way down which leads to drop out rates later on being way up. Our program, ""Don't Just Sit There. . Read Something"" encourages kids to read more, and thereby, get better grades and do better in school and its also inspires them to become better students and productive citizens.  Also, violence and bullying are real problems at todays schools and we address this issue thoroughly with our Character program, ""What Can I Do For You?"", with songs about sharing, helping others, self confidence and getting along.  With our Health/Nutrition program, ""Don't Just Sit There. . . Get Healthy"", in a real FUN, interactive way, we encourage kids to eat the right foods, get plenty of exercise and stay active to avoid the huge increase in obesity in todays youth and we also demonstrate in song effective habits to help kids avoid getting sick. </p>
<p>Another issue is that  Elementary-Middle school budgets and funding for Youth Organizations like Boys &amp; Girls Clubs, Big Brothers, Big Sisters, and Head Start Centers, have been drastically cut to the point where kids receive very little external, quality Educational programs (assemblies, motivational concerts). By targeting schools, we feel we can maximize the amount of kids we reach and filling the void created by these budget short falls.  </p>
<p>We were are constantly overwhelmed by the amazing reactions from these series of programs where we receive rave reviews like these 3 from teachers who observed our programs:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>C. D.- Kindergarten Teacher. . . ""Once in a while I am overwhelmed by the kindness and goodness others show to their fellow man. I can say that today was one of those days! How impressive that you take the time to share your musical and comedic talents with children! You definitely have a gift and I want you to know how much everyone at our school enjoyed and appreciated your assembly. Some of the comments I heard when we took time to discuss the assembly in class were: 'He was funny', 'I liked the music!', 'The dancing was FUN!', 'It was fun when we screamed!' etc., etc., ALL of the comments were positive!  It was heart warming to look out into the crowd and see all of the children laughing and smiling while they enjoyed the show. I am totally impressed with what you are doing. Thanks again for taking the time to come to our little school.""</p>
<p>S.L.- 6th Grade Teacher. . . ""I'm the sixth grade teacher. My class really enjoyed your presentation.  Since we don't have a music program at our school anymore (financial reasons), it was nice to have a musical program at our school. I also really liked the way you talked about the importance of reading. Thank you so much.""</p>
<p>Middle School Principal (5th grade - 8th). . . ""What I liked most about this program was the message of Leadership and that successful people are the ones that ""do"". I also loved the interaction of the students - they ALL participated in their own way. What I liked least about the programs was that it ended. Next time we'd love to include 9th and maybe 10th graders as well.""</p></span></div>","1. Organization

<p>***********************************</p>

<h3>Amy The Spirit Dancer's Story</h3>
<p>Greetings everyone!</p>
<p>I am Amy Riddle. Some folks call me The Spirit Dancer. </p>
<p>I am a creatress, herbalist, reverend, and muse residing in my hippie-healing dream town, Asheville, NC. I am quite proud of my bachelor's degree in Alternative Medicine from Everglades University and I crave to inspire others to be healthy and whole in body, mind, and spirit. </p>
<p>Recently I pondered the question:</p>
<p><em><strong>How can I bring all of my talents together and make them work for me as a career?  </strong></em></p>
<p>I asked this on top of Max Patch mountain and just a few hours later, I had an epiphany!</p>
<p>Be a Life Coach!</p>
<p>I've always wanted my own business and now my career path is crystal clear.</p>
<p>This is the perfect job for me! </p>
<p>I've been helping others my whole life. I help friends sort out their junk and start fresh. I help random passerbys by just lending an ear.</p>
<p>Friends, family, and strangers have always come to me for inspiration. </p>
<p>Now I know this is my calling.</p>
<p><strong>What would make me a fantastic Life Coach?</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I have an innate desire to help others. </li>
<li>
<p>I make my own flower essences and herbal remedies we could incorporate in the coaching.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I create jewelry and candles with spiritual energy. These too, are great tools for manifesting goals. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I listen intuitively and deeply. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I am a believer of manifesting your reality.</p>
</li>
<li>I walk my talk.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've been creating my own flower essences, however I plan on gaining certification by taking a Bach Flower essence course. If you aren't familiar with flower essences, check out Rescue Remedy from Bach. It is fantastic for treating stress. Flower essences are made directly from the flowering part of the plant and works energetically on the user. Developed by Dr. Edward Bach, they are great aids in helping mental and emotional aspects of wellness.</p>
<p>I want to dive deeper into the energy of flowers and get certified with Bach Flower Therapy. I feel that flower essences are going to be a huge part of my coaching.</p>
<div>After my epiphany, I began researching schools and training programs for Life Coaching. Most are online or though the telephone. I prefer personal contact. I found a weekend Life Coach training intensive in Nashville, TN. Perfect!</div>
<p>Help me make my dream of being a Life Coach come true. Help me help the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Transforming My Dream into Reality</h3>

Wow! Thank you, thank you, thank you! With your donations and some outside donations this is going to happen! I still need to figure out gas money to Nashville, but it's close...
If you missed out the opportunity to help me help the world...you can still donate directly through PayPal to spiritdancercreations@gmail.com or venture over to my blog...http://onajourneybacktoherwings.blogspot.com/ and there is a handy dandy donate button on the right.
 
Thank you so fairy much. I am oozing with gratitude! 
 So very happy.
 Love to you all.
~Amy The Spirit Dancer
*NOTE* January 9, 2013
I have been blessed with outside donations. I was able to register for my Life Coach training! I'm so excited.
With these outside donations, my money goal has now changed.
With this Indiegogo campaign, I need to reach $1000. 
$1000 would cover the rest of my tuition, transportation and food, plus the Indiegogo expenses.
I'm over halfway there!
Can you help me make my dream a reality?
Thank you.

Amy The Spirit Dancer's Story
Greetings everyone!
I am Amy Riddle. Some folks call me The Spirit Dancer. 
I am a creatress, herbalist, reverend, and muse residing in my hippie-healing dream town, Asheville, NC. I am quite proud of my bachelor's degree in Alternative Medicine from Everglades University and I crave to inspire others to be healthy and whole in body, mind, and spirit. 
Recently I pondered the question:
How can I bring all of my talents together and make them work for me as a career?  
I asked this on top of Max Patch mountain and just a few hours later, I had an epiphany!
Be a Life Coach!
I've always wanted my own business and now my career path is crystal clear.
This is the perfect job for me! 
I've been helping others my whole life. I help friends sort out their junk and start fresh. I help random passerbys by just lending an ear.
Friends, family, and strangers have always come to me for inspiration. 
Now I know this is my calling.
What would make me a fantastic Life Coach? 

I have an innate desire to help others. 

I make my own flower essences and herbal remedies we could incorporate in the coaching.




I create jewelry and candles with spiritual energy. These too, are great tools for manifesting goals. 


I listen intuitively and deeply. 




I am a believer of manifesting your reality.

I walk my talk.

I've been creating my own flower essences, however I plan on gaining certification by taking a Bach Flower essence course. If you aren't familiar with flower essences, check out Rescue Remedy from Bach. It is fantastic for treating stress. Flower essences are made directly from the flowering part of the plant and works energetically on the user. Developed by Dr. Edward Bach, they are great aids in helping mental and emotional aspects of wellness.
I want to dive deeper into the energy of flowers and get certified with Bach Flower Therapy. I feel that flower essences are going to be a huge part of my coaching.
After my epiphany, I began researching schools and training programs for Life Coaching. Most are online or though the telephone. I prefer personal contact. I found a weekend Life Coach training intensive in Nashville, TN. Perfect!
Help me make my dream of being a Life Coach come true. Help me help the world.
 
Transforming My Dream into Reality
How can I make my dream a reality? I have the passion, the drive, the plan...all I need to make it happen is the funds.


The $ Breakdown 
~ Life Coach Training in Nasheville, TN - February 22-24 - $695
(I'm very excited about this program, they go over the theories and fundamentals of life coaching, you get one on one practice, and on the last day you set up a complete marketing plan. They cover everything to get me rolling as a Life Coach.)
~ Hotel Accommodations for Life Coach Training  - $600
~ Transportation and Meals for Life Coach Training  - $385
~ Bach Flower Remedy Certification Course with Bach Flower Essences Kit - $550
~ Indiegogo % - $270
~ Misc/Shipping Costs for Intention Candles/Forgotten Costs/Who knows? - $300
 
And by helping me, you get perks! 
Gifts/Perks/Opportunities 
Depending on which donation amount you choose, depends on which gift and opportunity you receive.
What can you expect? Here are the perks you can attain...
~ Free shipping or coupons for my Spirit Dancer Creations Etsy shop.
http://www.etsy.com/shop/Backtomywings
Keep checking out my shop, I plan on adding new items periodically. 
~ A Spirit Dancer Intention Candle
You could get a Spirit Dancer Intention Candle. My candles are quite unique. They are crafted with recycled wax. Plus I add a bit of magic to them! I'm a Reverend and I bless my candles with energy attuned to the color and scent. Want more passion in your life? You need a red candle!
~ A Year's Worth of Advertising
On my website, I will have a business networking page where I will list your name with a super big Thank You and you have the opportunity to list your business here. Include your website, blog, Facebook page, Pinterest, Etsy shop, and any online link for your business is encouraged. 
Spread the love!
~ Permanent Advertising 
For the larger donations, you will get permanent advertising on my website. Same as the year's worth, only permanent. As long as my website is up, so is ALL of your business information. I want to thank you forever!
~ Life Coaching Sessions
That's why I'm doing this, so who wants some life coaching sessions? Let me inspire you. Let me be your own personal cheerleader. I can help you create goals and attain them. It's my special power. 
 
I want to remain positive and say I will reach my goal...however if I don't quite make it...whatever funds that are raised will go towards the Life Coach training seminar. If I have to take crackers to eat and sleep in my car, I'm going. 
 
Manifestation


With the Life Coaching training in February, I could start accepting clients right after! By April 1st, I should have the website up and all perks promised should be fulfilled.
Help me make my dream a reality. I know that I can empower you to move past your limits. I am excited to help you discover what you want in your life and set your focused goals in to motion. 
I believe I was born to be a Life Coach. It is my special power.
I can coach from anywhere. If you are in the Asheville area, we can get together in person. If not, we can have sessions through skype or telephone. 
Let me inspire you!
I've discovered my calling, let me help you find yours. 
 
How else can you help? So glad you asked!


Please share my campaign, it's super easy. 
Share with the Indiegogo share tools...share on Facebook, Twitter, your personal blog, etc. 
Spread the word. Spread the inspiration!
Help me help the world! 
Thank you, thank you, thank you! And a HUGE THANK YOU to Indiegogo! Because of Indiegogo, people are able to make their dreams a reality. Amazing!
 
May you have a fairy good day!
Peace, Inspiration, and Love,
~Amy Riddle

</div></div>","Our Story




The Club Sailing Team at Villanova is looking forward to our
eighth consecutive year as a member of the Mid-Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing
Association.  We are officially recognized
by the University, but as a club team, we only receive a small amount of
funding to cover all of our expenses.  On
a day to day basis these include yacht club fees, league fees, travel costs and
hotels for regatta weekends.  To cover
these costs we fundraise and rely heavily on team member dues.  


We have grown in size and skill over the past few years, and
with the addition of our new coach, Matt Newborn, we are in the process of raising
the competitive level of the team.  We are
a team of committed sailors who want to make a name for Villanova Sailing, and
the current condition of the team’s sailing facilities and equipment are two
major obstacles for us.  We currently
practice at Cooper River Yacht Club outside of Camden, NJ.  The Cooper River is manmade and was designed
for crew racing.  Even without the
constant traffic of high school crew teams, the river itself is not an ideal
sailing venue.  The team currently does
not own its own boats and leases Cooper River YC’s fleet of Flying Juniors
(FJs).  The newest boat is from 1994 and
the aging fleet does not facilitate competitive practice.







Our Goal 









Our goal for the immediate future is to move away from
Cooper River and transition to practicing out of Corinthian Yacht Club on the
Delaware River.  Currently both Drexel University
and the University of Pennsylvania already practice at Corinthian and it would
benefit all three teams if we were practicing at the same location.  The only way this transition is possible is
with a large increase in team finances. 
The Corinthian YC dues are significantly higher than Cooper River’s and
we would also need to provide our own fleet of boats, a coach boat and dock
facilities.  A coach boat will be a huge stepping stone for us.  Our team is already in the
midst of the fundraising and logistics involved in this transition, but we are
looking for your help to accomplish the next step.





How to Help
Help us raise the $8,000 required to purchase a coach boat and make Corinthian our new home!  The only way this is possible for us is with the help of you!  Your support will have an astounding effect on our team! We would love it if you would join as a contributing member of our team and make our goals our realities. 



All donations to the Villanova Sailing Team are
100% tax deductible. 


Thank you so much for your support!  Please contact us with any questions you mayhave at our team email: officers@villanovasailing.com or by contacting our coach, Matt Newborn directly at (908)-500-6066.

<h3>Hello-- and HELP!</h3>
<p>My name is Kate, representing a group of dedicated and concerned folks working to establish a non-profit organization in order to  secure and restore the Smith Farm (circa 1850) in Middlesex ccounty, NJ. Our eventual goal is to provide educational programming, community garden and farm plots, and to establish an agricultural arts museum. In order to file the paperwork, do the searches and apply for a 501(C)3, we need your help.</p>
<h3>A Little Background and Some Plans</h3>
<p>The farmstead-- house, out buildings and acres of farmland-- are  township property. Plans to develope a golfcourse a few years ago did not materialize, and since that time the buildings have been vacant. The farm was the Lambertson family homestead for generations, and is a wonderful example of Victorian country Americana. Unfortunately, the  township does not have available funds or manpower to properly restore and maintain the buildings and grounds. An area resident still farms the fields and offers occasional programs to teach  students about agriculture. We hope to help him expand these programs, and institute others, once we achieve non-profit status.</p>
<h3>What Your Contributions Will Do</h3>
<p>The funds we raise will go first toward filing application for the 501(C)3, with remainder put toward the purchasing of clean up and maintenance supplies, new locks and replacement glass for broken panes once we are approved by the township for this work. Fortunately, we have a talented crew who can do alot and are looking forward to it.  Also, a portion of funds raised will go to the printing of our very special one-of-a-kind perks. The postcards will be copied from the private collections of individuals who have graciously offered to help us out. These are folks genuinely interested in history and truly dedicated to the idea of historical preservation. </p>
<h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
<p>Providing we can establish a non-profit organization and be granted permission from the township (which support has been favorable so far.) our ultimate goals include furnishing several rooms in the house to represent a Victorian Farm Home, with space for special displays, and  events including farmer's market, picnics, old time auctions, historic and military reenactments and holiday exhibits. Ambitious goals, certainly, but one which will not only benefit the community, but provide both a source for educational programs and leisure activities. Some of the land can be open for use by garden clubs,which have already expressed an interest, as well as boy and girl scout troops, and  community organizations. School groups and others can learn first hand about farming and if possible, be given plots for their own use. The red barn and other outbuildings will house vintage farm tools and early machinary. We are especially exciited about introducing young people to the history and importance of farmers and farming.</p>
<h3>What's In It For You!  </h3>
<p>Besides knowing you are helping to rescue a lovely Victorian home, and bringing hands-on farming experience to young folks (and bringing back hopefully happy memories to some of the older ones!)? We have a few perks we hope will inspire you to join us on our mission.</p>
<p>There are special limited edition reproduction Victorian postcards from  private collections, which will be available only through this campaign! Also, a limited number of signed art photographs and prints of natural views and old farmsteads. AND even original artwork--a painting done exclusively for you of the Smith farm.  </p>
<h3>Almost Done!  </h3>
<p>Most of our group have had several years of experience in historical education, including museum curators, living history reenactors and former and present employees of the National Park Service and other historic sites. We have also received promises of support, donation of materials and 'elbow grease' from local contractors and businesses-- but all of this hinges on the success of our fundraising here.</p>
<p>Please join us in taking this first step towards rescuing the Smith Farm, making agricultural history come alive. Please help spread the word-- and thank you for your kind support!</p>

Providing we can establish a non-profit organization and be granted permission from the township (which support has been favorable so far.) our ultimate goals include furnishing several rooms in the house to represent a Victorian Farm Home, with space for special displays, and  events including farmer's market, picnics, old time auctions, historic and military reenactments and holiday exhibits. Ambitious goals, certainly, but one which will not only benefit the community, but provide both a source for educational programs and leisure activities. Some of the land can be open for use by garden clubs,which have already expressed an interest, as well as boy and girl scout troops, and  community organizations. School groups and others can learn first hand about farming and if possible, be given plots for their own use. The red barn and other outbuildings will house vintage farm tools and early machinary. We are especially exciited about introducing young people to the history and importance of farmers and farming.
What's In It For You!  
Besides knowing you are helping to rescue a lovely Victorian home, and bringing hands-on farming experience to young folks (and bringing back hopefully happy memories to some of the older ones!)? We have a few perks we hope will inspire you to join us on our mission.
There are special limited edition reproduction Victorian postcards from  private collections, which will be available only through this campaign! Also, a limited number of signed art photographs and prints of natural views and old farmsteads. AND even original artwork--a painting done exclusively for you of the Smith farm.  
Almost Done!  
Most of our group have had several years of experience in historical education, including museum curators, living history reenactors and former and present employees of the National Park Service and other historic sites. We have also received promises of support, donation of materials and 'elbow grease' from local contractors and businesses-- but all of this hinges on the success of our fundraising here.
Please join us in taking this first step towards rescuing the Smith Farm, making agricultural history come alive. Please help spread the word-- and thank you for your kind support!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><em><strong>Going on an Adventure! I've been Accepted to Naropa University for Somatic Psychology Dance/Movement Therapy Graduate Program. Gonna Change this Planet for the better, one person at a time!</strong></em></h3>
<p>Some of you may know me and others may not.</p>
<p>I'm Ali Landers, A vivacious, loving mom of 2 amazing people, DREAMING BIG, BELIEVING IN CHANGE, TRUSTING &amp; TAKING ACTION!</p>
<p>  My passion and purpose is healing minds, hearts and bodies through Dance &amp; Movement Therapy! I've been making this dream a reality for 4 years now with the intention of becoming a counselor in Somatic Psychology. I want to serve people the best I can and in a way I have experienced great healing myself...through the mode I believe in most, Somatics, the body. Somatic Therapy leading the way in mental health therapy today!</p>
<p>Our bodies speak to us! They are powerful vehicles for healing!! *For more info. on this form of therapy, see Naropa's program at <a href=""http://www.naropa.edu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.naropa.edu</a></p>
<p>The path is showing up and I'm ready for the next step on this beautiful, passionate journey! The next step is Attending Naropa University, beginning this Fall!!</p>
<p>My story began with Somatic Psychology 9 years ago. I was in the process of divorce and was feeling depressed and lost, not knowing what to do with my life after being a stay at home mom for 10 years.</p>
<p>I had some college under my belt and knew I wanted to pursue my dream of finishing college. I registred for classes at BSU and started on the journey to a BA. I knew I wanted to study psychology and also wanted to explore my love of dance. I decided to take some dance classes. It was hard at first, to go into that dance studio with all those young dancers, and me and old 32. ha.</p>
<p>I loved it!! I had found a part of me, I thought was dead. I had found a new way of healing myself through dance, and moving my body in ways that made me feel alive and whole. I knew I had stumbled upon somehting wonderful...and I was right.</p>
<p>I started to research this phenomenon I had expereinenced, mental health through dance and movement. What I found was surprising and exhilarating! Dancers had been using healing movement for a very long time, even one of Freud's students had studied this modality in the 20's. This form of Therapy was making some headway in the mental health field and it just so happened that I could get a Masters degree in this cutting edge therapy called Somatic Psychology!</p>
<p>That was all I needed to know. I looked up schools offering this degree, chose the one that best fit my beliefs and lifestyle and Naropa University was it!!</p>
<p>It was on! I designed my degree at BSU to fit the criteria for Naropa and worked hard for 2 years to finish with a BA in Psychology w/ a Dance Minor. Having finished that part of my goal. I was on to my main objective, to get accepted into the Somatic Psychology program at Naropa.</p>
<p>Only 25 students are accepted a year. I knew I had a chance with all the activities and education I had experienced. I sent my application and letters off, and it was a waiting game. I finally got an email saying I'd been invited for an inverview! I hopped on a plane in a blizzard, and went to Naropa for a full day of interviews and activities.</p>
<p>The Monday I got back from Boulder, I got a phone call. I had been accepted to The Somatic Psychology Program!!! I had made it in! I was Elated!! Dreams do come true! with determination and hardwork and believing...we can move mountains.</p>
<p>I have made it this far and now am in the process of moving my life to Boulder. It will be no small feat... And I know I have come this far to <strong>go all the way.</strong></p>
<p>I will need the support of my family, loved ones and people who know and believe in me!</p>
<h3><em><strong>My daughter and I are taking this journey together. We need your love and support to make this dream possible.</strong></em></h3>
</div>
<p>I need to earn $4,000 by Aug. 3 THAT IS ONLY 200 people contributing $20.00!! This is to get Feena and I settled in Boulder. i'll have school funds and a job while i'm there working on my Masters.</p>
<p>I am reaching out to my beloved Community, Family and Friends for assistance.</p>
<p>I wish gas stations took cookies and Landlords accepted dance lessons! Until that time, I need monetary units to get Feena and I set up for a 3 year adventure in Boulder, CO.</p>
<p>I want you all to know, I have every intention to Pay it Forward with my degree in counseling. I'll be returning to Boise throughout my program to hold circles, to teach classes, bring smiles and to love on my community.</p>
<p>PLUS... It is my intention to serve others in need through Women's and Children's programs and being part of bringing awareness and grace to people of all abilities through movement and Dance! To Serve with compassion!</p>
<p>The future is unknown...and, who knows, I may be returning after this journey to contribute to my beloved community in Boise.</p>

<p><span style=""""></span><span style="""">These students break ties with normal classroom settings, and instead are challenged to create a hands-on learning experience. </span></p>

</h3>
<p>Samaritan Place is an organization that provides shelter for very low-income seniors and is one of a very small group of such programs in the United States.  It's the Nation’s only program offering a complete continuum of care, from emergency to long-term housing, for this population.<span style=""""> </span></p>
<p>Because homelessness issues are different for seniors than for their younger counterparts, Samaritan Place provides not only shelter and nourishment but intensive case management focused on that population’s unique needs.</p>
<p>Samaritan Place, just like us, wouldn't be able to exist without generous donations. We're really passionate about the Barefoot Benefit and we are planning to have the largest number of participants this year due to the change of course location.  Help us help Samaritan Place! </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What we need :</h3>
<p>Each year our race is funded by generous donations from people and companies in Knoxville and surrounding areas.  We could just send those funds directly to the Samaritan Place, however our goal is to utilize the money and multiply it with The Barefoot Benefit. </p>
<p>This year we're trying to raise around $5,000 to fund different aspects of the race day such as hiring bands to play, paying for aspects of marketing such as newspaper ads, as well as the equipment used to time our runners.</p>

We are excited to announce this year’s Fourth Annual Barefoot Benefit 5K and Fall Festival to benefit the Samaritan Place of Knoxville! 
The event will take place on October 27th, 2013 at 2pm on the grass of Cherokee Park in The Sequoyah Hills Neighborhood. The Barefoot Benefit is a unique event, organized solely by a group of students from the University of Tennessee’s College of Business. 
These students break ties with normal classroom settings, and instead are challenged to create a hands-on learning experience. 
The Barefoot Benefit was also the first ever barefoot race and walk, and guided by Dr. Ernie Cadotte, we plan to make this year’s event bigger and better than ever.
Visit Thebarefootbenefit.org or Facebook.com/Barefootbenefit for more info.
 



Why we exist:

Samaritan Place is an organization that provides shelter for very low-income seniors and is one of a very small group of such programs in the United States.  It's the Nation’s only program offering a complete continuum of care, from emergency to long-term housing, for this population. 
Because homelessness issues are different for seniors than for their younger counterparts, Samaritan Place provides not only shelter and nourishment but intensive case management focused on that population’s unique needs.
Samaritan Place, just like us, wouldn't be able to exist without generous donations. We're really passionate about the Barefoot Benefit and we are planning to have the largest number of participants this year due to the change of course location.  Help us help Samaritan Place! 
 




What we need :
Each year our race is funded by generous donations from people and companies in Knoxville and surrounding areas.  We could just send those funds directly to the Samaritan Place, however our goal is to utilize the money and multiply it with The Barefoot Benefit. 
This year we're trying to raise around $5,000 to fund different aspects of the race day such as hiring bands to play, paying for aspects of marketing such as newspaper ads, as well as the equipment used to time our runners.
 


Other ways you can help:
For anyone living in the Knoxville area, visit our web page and sign up to race!  We offer a 5k race, a 1 mile fun-run, as well as a fall festival for the entire family!
