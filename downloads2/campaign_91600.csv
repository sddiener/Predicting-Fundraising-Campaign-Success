	The AirPatron is an advanced hidden surveillance camera for home or business use. 


It contains state-of-the-art technology that sends 
live video to your mobile phone,PC or tablet.



	The main design was developed to blend in with 
your home decor - the purpose of this is to dupe intruders into thinking it’s just an everyday household 
ornament - when in fact it’s actually a powerful security device that’s recording their 
every move!



	 With an internet connection you can view your home or office from anywhere in the world. 

                      Beat the Burglar!        


	Our unique AirPatron software has numerous practical options which will enable 
you to customise how it operates.



	Set it to record at certain times of the day or night - useful for keeping an eye on children coming home from school for example. Alternatively you can set it to record on movement detection only - perfect for capturing intruders.

Recordings can be stored either on a memory card within the device itself, 
directly onto our cloud server (FREE OF CHARGE) or on your own hard drive. 


	The AirPatron puts you in complete control of 
	your home or office security.


The AirPatron will send email alerts (with pictures attached) to your mobile 
phone, PC or tablet warning you of movement detection. 


It can also send additional email alerts to any pre-designated contacts such as 
friends or neighbours - this is particularly beneficial when you’re on holiday. 



 The AirPatron enables you to respond immediately to any unwanted activity in 
your home, significantly reducing any adverse consequences.





                     
Hidden Camera Surveillance                       The AirPatron has a built-in hidden camera to record all intruders. Anyone who 
breaks into your home or office won’t realise they’re being recorded, or that 
you have been made aware of their intrusion by a photographic email alert.                         AirPatron with built in camera - perfect for covert surveillance
                                                 Available in white or blackThe AirPatron is as versatile and flexible as you want it to be. The designs have been developed to look like everyday items you'd expect to see in a normal household - this is not just to fool the burglar but also to ensure your home will still look like a home and not a high security prison! Choose an AirPatron either in black or white to get you started, add more as and when you feel ready - there are no expensive contracts to tie you in. All the devices will work on their own but will also connect with each other today, tomorrow - even ten years from now! The AirPatron belongs to you.

additional satellite devices that will independently monitor different rooms and email
pictures to you. The AirPatron 
	range will include bedside clocks, wall 
clocks and smoke alarms, all with cameras discreetly hidden 
inside them - intruders won’t stand a chance!                                  

With every AirPatron purchase you will receive a t-shirt and also a door/window sticker warning would-be intruders that 
your home is monitored by AirPatron’s hidden cameras - you’ll quickly discover that 
	the 
prospect of being caught on camera is a very powerful deterrent for any thief!!                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                 Peace of MindSimply install the AirPatron in your home or office to keep an eye on your 
possessions, or just use it to monitor your loved ones. Install an AirPatron 
device in your relative’s home and enjoy total peace of mind. The AirPatron is 
perfect for this type of surveillance.

How many times has 
your alarm gone off at 4am on a cold, dark morning and a call centre informed you of a 
possible intrusion? With a fear of the unknown making you extremely anxious, you arrive at your 
premises - only to find it’s a false 
alarm!


How much better
would it be if you had an alert on your phone telling you that movement 
had been detected at your business premises - which you could then view, room by room on 
your mobile phone, PC or tablet - even when it’s totally dark?


With the night vision 
capabilities of the AirPatron you can check what’s going on from your sofa, your bed or 
even while you’re on holiday on the other side of the world!!


                          How it WorksThe default settings on your device (which you can 
change) will be set up to start recording when motion is detected and to store 
these recordings on our cloud server. All your recordings will be viewable only by yourself when you log on to your private AirPatron account - even if your AirPatron were to be stolen you would still have pictures as well as a recording of the burglar caught in the act to hand over to the police - storage will of course be FREE! Apart from storing your pictures and recordings in our cloud you can also choose to store your recordings on the device 
itself via a memory card or on your own computer. The AirPatron is a completely user-friendly security device that doesn't 
over-complicate the basic task of capturing criminals red-handed. Any recording 
or attachment which incriminates the offender can be handed over to your local law 
enforcement authority. Don't ever consider trying to use physical force to 
apprehend a criminal - let AirPatron do it for you - safely.                      Multi-View Surveillance



The AirPatron enables you to keep a close eye on everything and everyone by remotely watching what's happening
in your house 
or office. The AirPatron connects 
to your home or office via the internet allowing you to watch live action on 
your PC, mobile phone or tablet. Keep an eye on 
your property wherever you happen to be, thanks to the AirPatron.



Add up to 10 individual cameras per house or office. Mix and 
	match the different designs of hidden cameras in your home or office.



The AirPatron multi-view screen streams up to ten live 
video feeds at any one time - view up to ten different locations at any one time on your PC, mobile phone or tablet.


                                                    Easy set-up


	The AirPatron can be set up in a 
matter of minutes with your desktop computer, mobile phone, iPad or Android device.



	Turn on notifications to receive email alerts when movement has been detected.



	Whether you’re on a 
computer, smart phone or other internet capable device, as long as you can 
connect to the internet you will be able to access the live video being streamed 
	from your AirPatron.



	The AirPatron detects changes in the image being monitored - and will send an email alert to up 
	
	to 3 different email addresses with a snapshot attached.



Log on to your AirPatron account and view your home/office anytime from anywhere in the world.

hidden camera to fool the burglar - anyone who breaks into your home or office won’t realise that they’re being recorded or that a photographic email alert 
has already been sent to you. How many AirPatrons do I need for my home or office?
That all depends on how much cover you want - you can add and view up to ten 
devices in any one location.What is required to use the AirPatron in 
my home or office?

connected to your PC and you're good to go.Where can I log on to my AirPatron?You will be able to log on to 
your AirPatron from anywhere in the world as long as you have an internet 
connection. Imagine you live in New York and you are on holiday in Europe, how useful would 
it be to log on to your AirPatron and check that all is well at home? Peace of mind is priceless.

<p>To keep this lifeline flowing, ApocalypsEV created a portable phone charging trailer concept called the ATST (All Terrain Solar Trailer).

<p>With your help ApocalypsEV is looking to raise $100k for current and future disaster relief. We plan to send 25% of all funds raised to the American Red Cross, just in time for Christmas. With the remaining funds, we will buy the tools and supplies needed to create an initial fleet of solar powered phone-charging trailers and a pair of disaster ready, electrically powered ATVs that can deliver these trailers without relying on potentially damaged gas and eclectic infrastructures.</p>
<p>The trailers will carry at least 1200W of solar panels that charge a bank of deep cycle all weather AGM batteries. A combination of 100 USB ports and 110V plugs will be spread over the trailer with the goal of charging 100 cell phones simultaneously. The trailers can be left in areas without power for as long as it takes to get the utilities back up and running. Furthermore, if it proves practical, the trailers will also feature a WIFI satellite uplink.</p>

<p>Hey there.  Thank you for checking out my project.  I’ve spent the last year designing and developing what I believe to be the ultimate all-in-one glare guard, protectant, and privacy safe-guard for your laptop, iPad, or other electronic device.</p>
<h2>INTRODUCING THE COMPUTER CABANA</h2>
<p><img alt=""The computer Cabana"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/449511/pictures/full/20120918212606-cabana_on_grass.jpg?1348028780"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>TRADEMARKED AND PATENT-PENDING</strong></p>
<h2><strong>The Beginning</strong></h2>
<p>Here in Southern California, the sun shines most of the year.  That's great for riding my bike, but not so much for enjoying my laptop computer outside.  I tried those films you slap on your screen, but they didn’t work.  I tried those whatcha-ma-callits that clip on to the screen and Velcro to the sides, but that actually damaged my screen and got a little messy. THEN - - one afternoon at a friend's wedding, while using my laptop computer in a cabana by the pool, I was able to view everything on my screen PERFECTLY.   And right then and thenre.  Just like that.  The idea for the Computer Cabana was born.   It took plenty of designing, redesigning, and developing, along with about 12 or so prototypes along the way, but finally, I finally got it to where it is now.  </p>
<p>What's great about the Computer Cabana is it's simplicity:  It serves 3 purposes, and does so in stylish fashion.</p>
<h3> 1.  GLAREGUARD</h3>
<p><img alt=""Glareguard"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/448770/pictures/full/20120918143628-cabana_glareguard.jpg?1348004227"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>No more squinting and straining your eyes caused by the sun's annoying glare.</p>
<h3> 2.   PROTECTANT</h3>
<p> <img alt=""Protectant"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/448736/pictures/full/20120918142148-cabana_protectant.jpg?1348003409"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Protects your device from elements in the area that can potentially cause significant damage.</p>
<h3> 3.  PRIVACY SAFEGUARD</h3>

<p>Prevents wandering eyes from your personal information, keeping all of your viewing private and for your eyes only.</p>
<h2> What's it's made of</h2>
<p>The Computer Cabana is made with a special “sun block” material that completely filters out the sun, leaving the inside fully shaded for easy visibility.  The frame is made of a very unique type of light-weight aluminum rod, which makes it convenient to take anywhere.</p>
<h2> Why it's AWESOME</h2>
<p>Unlike some other products that claim to do similar tasks, with the Computer Cabana there’s no taping any Velcro to your device.  There’s no clunky visor-like parts to attach to your screen.  Just open it up and you’re ready.   No other product serves all three purposes with such ease and with such style.</p>
<p>ALSO, with the holidays just around the corner, the Computer Cabana would make for an amazing gift.</p>
<h2> Why I need your support</h2>
<p>I need your help bringing this great product to market.  The design for the Computer Cabana has been finalized and plans for production are in place.  I located a manufacturing facility in Southern California that is willing to partner up, but there are substantial start-up costs involved with getting a new business off the ground.  Along with the actual manufacturing location, there are the raw materials, the proper equipment, the molds, and of course the labor force.  It’s quite expensive.  The plan is to use all the Kickstarter funds to move the Computer Cabana into the next level of production - - assembling and manufacturing everything here in Southern California.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to check out my project, and ltogether we can bring the Computer Cabana to that next level. </p>
<p>Check out the groovy perks, and be the first one on your block to rock the Computer Cabana.</p>

Initially the project was using off the shelf components but soon after that Leon decided to create his own Raspberry Pi HAT for easy IoT prototyping. </p><p>Inspired by <b>Olimex</b> and Tsvetan Uzunov's presentations about open source hardware at FOSDEM and Hackaday Belgrade, Leon insisted on using the free and open source electronics design automation suite KiCAD for the PCB design. In April 2016, the software engineer Leon bought his first soldering iron from Olimex and started working on the first hardware prototypes.</p><p>Designing PCB requires a lot of hardware skills and experience so Leon needed help. It was not easy to find a suitable hardware engineer familiar with KiCAD. After making a lot of contacts and speaking to various engineers finally Leon found the right people. Thanks to the PCB manufacturing services of <b>OSH Park</b> the first PCB prototypes were ready at the end of June 2016. </p><p>As expected the first version was far from perfect. There were  a few bugs which were quickly fixed. The next hardware revision and a small-run batch was ready in August 2016. It featured a new buzzer, a new button and a potentiometer for controlling the light and contrast of the LCD display module. </p><p>In September 2016, after a lot of hard work, the first version of the user's manual of ANAVI Flex was released with open source examples written in Python and the C programming language.</p><p>In October 2016 first prototypes of ANAVI Flex were shipped to developers and bloggers. Another hardware revision with minor improvements was made and a small quantity of ANAVI Flex Raspberry Pi HATs was released on sale and quickly went out of stock in Tindie.</p><p><strong> Now we need your help for to reduce the price per unit and go to mass production :)</strong></p><h3>What Is the Road Map of ANAVI Flex?</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476825972/hozw0qdzrm4x1yc6xyui.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>After shipping all perks the road map of ANAVI Flex focuses on the software development of GNU/Linux distribution for Internet of Things (IoT) with the Yocto Project and Openembedded that features an application for reporting data from the sensors and receiving remote commands through the lightweight machine to machine communication project MQTT.

What Is the Story of ANAVI Flex?ANAVI started as a small hobby project by Leon Anavi in November 2015. Initially the project was using off the shelf components but soon after that Leon decided to create his own Raspberry Pi HAT for easy IoT prototyping. Inspired by Olimex and Tsvetan Uzunov's presentations about open source hardware at FOSDEM and Hackaday Belgrade, Leon insisted on using the free and open source electronics design automation suite KiCAD for the PCB design. In April 2016, the software engineer Leon bought his first soldering iron from Olimex and started working on the first hardware prototypes.Designing PCB requires a lot of hardware skills and experience so Leon needed help. It was not easy to find a suitable hardware engineer familiar with KiCAD. After making a lot of contacts and speaking to various engineers finally Leon found the right people. Thanks to the PCB manufacturing services of OSH Park the first PCB prototypes were ready at the end of June 2016. As expected the first version was far from perfect. There were  a few bugs which were quickly fixed. The next hardware revision and a small-run batch was ready in August 2016. It featured a new buzzer, a new button and a potentiometer for controlling the light and contrast of the LCD display module. In September 2016, after a lot of hard work, the first version of the user's manual of ANAVI Flex was released with open source examples written in Python and the C programming language.In October 2016 first prototypes of ANAVI Flex were shipped to developers and bloggers. Another hardware revision with minor improvements was made and a small quantity of ANAVI Flex Raspberry Pi HATs was released on sale and quickly went out of stock in Tindie. Now we need your help for to reduce the price per unit and go to mass production :)What Is the Road Map of ANAVI Flex?After shipping all perks the road map of ANAVI Flex focuses on the software development of GNU/Linux distribution for Internet of Things (IoT) with the Yocto Project and Openembedded that features an application for reporting data from the sensors and receiving remote commands through the lightweight machine to machine communication project MQTT. A user friends HTML5 web interface with Node.js backend will be available for remote control of your Raspberry Pi and RabbitMax Flex.Want to Know More?Please visit our website at anavi.technology, Facebook, Twitter and Hackaday.io for more information.Thank You!
ANAVI was started as a project by Leon Anavi and it has been moving forward thanks to him and his friends.

<p>Through years of design and material testing, we've reduced the size of the ASAP Connect tip to only 10mm (0.39"") wide which fits perfectly into all your Apple and Android devices. We've tested the tips on over 100 phone cases and found it fit on all of them. The only exception is for some phone cases which have a protective flap on the charging port which may not be able to close properly with the tip in place. This also the case for the Samsung S5 phone due to its inbuilt protective flap.</p>

<p><b>What truly sets ASAP Connect apart from other magnetic connectors is its unique bevelled and concave magnetic connector design on both the tip end and cable head end.</b></p>
<p>Through this careful 360° exterior positioning of 2 strong neodymium magnets on both ends, the tip only needs to be within the magnetic field of the cable end to be quickly attracted and connect seamlessly. </p>
<p>Competitor designs require the tips to be correctly aligned inside the cable head which requires guidance to be connected correctly if missed. Competitor designs also use weaker magnets and require a very perfect alignment of the cable and tip for a correct connection. See if you can guess which is ASAP Connect below. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/JhD8gRO.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Don't be fooled by the similar external look of competitor cables, ASAP Connect (on the right) will connect correctly even if the tip is flipped 180° due to both the strong neodymium magnets having their polarity perfectly positioned and the unique outward and concave magnetic connector design. </p>

<p>We've added an adapter perk which is based off the same technology as the cable. The advantage of the adapter is that you can swap between your existing cable and the magnetic cable by simply snapping on or off the adapter. Please note that we <u>highly recommend the cable over the adapter</u> due to the adapter combined with your existing cable being heavier than just the ASAP Connect cable head on it's own. A heavier cable head means it is more likely for the magnets to disconnect during use.</p>
<p>So far we are offering the adapter in the colors silver and gunmetal. We may offer down the track the colors rose gold and gold if we see a good response for the adapters. </p>
<p>When the adapter is attached to your cable the LED light will stay on permanently when connected to a power source. This is different to the cable LED light which only turns on when connected to your phone.</p>
<p>Please note: you do not need to purchase the adapter to use the current ASAP Connect.</p>

<p>ASAP Connect is 100% compatible with all data transfer technology and fast charge technology including QualComm 2.0, QualComm 3.0 and Samsung Adaptive Fast Charge.</p>
<p>Please note that our cables are not cross compatible which means Apple cables are not compatible with Android tips and vice versa due to their unique connector properties. More information is available in the design section below.</p>

<p>We have evolved away from the traditional Lightning tip for Apple devices to create what we call the ""Alpha"" tip for 2 main reasons:</p>
<p>REASON 1: Have you ever had your Lightning tip start wobbling and eventually break off? This happens because the tip and base are made of 2 different components which break apart over repeated use. The Alpha tip solves this problem by integrating both the tip and base into 1 piece.</p>
</div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/iSHnMYI.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>REASON 2: As Apple has not currently released their own magnetic Lightning tips, anyone seeking MFi certification from Apple will be refused as they will need to purchase the tips from an Apple MFi certified magnetic Lightning tip manufacturer which does not currently exist as of April 2016.</p>
<p>Without MFi certification most major retailers will not sell a USB cable for Apple devices and leaves the brand potentially open to law suits from Apple. The integration of the Alpha tip bypasses this certification process by not using the Lightning tip and allowing ASAP Connect to be manufactured and sold in major retailers worldwide.</p>

<p><b>Beware of imitations, fake and low quality magnetic cables on the Internet.</b> We have purchased samples directly off dozens of suppliers who claim to produce premium magnetic USB cables and performed both extensive laboratory and daily-use testing.</p>
<p>Here are our findings:</p>
<p>-  We have found many to not work as claimed, not be reversible, not transfer data nor charge your phone as it's maximum speed. We have even found some to create smoke and even damage your phone</p>
<p>- Many of these companies offer cables that do not have the following certifications: FCC, CE, ROHS and hence may not be approved for sale in your country. You should always ask the seller first if they have these international certifications before making a purchase</p>
<p>- Any company which claims to have Apple MFi certified lightning magnetic tips is completely false as of 27th April 2016. Apple has not currently produced nor approved any magnetic Lightning tips commercially and hence will not provide a MFi licenced magnetic Lighting connector to any company attempting to selling magnetic connectors as of 27th April 2016</p>
<p>- We have found many companies to use poor quality magnets that have weak magnetism or lose their connectivity over time due to no magnetic plating</p>
<p>- We have found many companies produce tip designs that are too thick and wide to fit on your phone case</p>

<details><summary>How do I choose my colour and connector type?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">You will be emailed a survey to your inbox via Backerkit at the end of the campaign within 7 days of the campaign ending.</p></details><details><summary>Can I choose a different ASAP Connect connector type and color for each cable I order, even if I order them together as 1 perk?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">Yes 100%, you can choose a different connector type and colour for every cable purchased. For example, this means if you purchase a TWIN PACK, you can choose 1 Apple and 1 Android cable in 2 different colours.</p></details><details><summary>How will my order be shipped?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">All orders will be shipping with the most suitable premium courier and that will vary between countries. All shipments will have tracking which will be emailed to you once the delivery has been shipped.</p></details><details><summary>Which countries do you ship to?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">We ship to all countries excluding the following which have been flagged by courier services as restricted or high risk: Belarus, Cote d'Ivoire, Cuba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Liberia, North Korea, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Syria &amp; Zimbabwe. If you would like a shipment to any these countries we will make alternative arrangements that may cost more, however we cannot guarantee the shipment's arrival.</p></details><details><summary>Your campaign seems similar to these other crowdfunding campaigns ""ZAPTIP"" and ""ZNAPS"" which both are way past their delivery date and also have poor communication with backers so we're very concerned that they are ""scams"" and this campaign is too. </summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">This question has been added as we feel it's important we are 100% transparent about our project and to establish trust with our backers. We have been dealing with reports from the Indiegogo Trust and Safety Team in regards to these campaigns. Neither our product nor any member of our team is in any way associated with those 2 campaigns. Our technology is proprietary to ASAP Technologies and we have a utility patent-pending on ASAP Connect with patent filing number P103013.AU.</p></details><details><summary>So did your company actually invent the original magnetic USB technology? </summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">It is very important that all backers understand that this technology has been available in Asia since 2014. No company has claimed to have invent the original magnetic USB technology in the form of a patent so we will never truly know who originally invented it as magnetic power connection has been around for over 20 years and predates even the invention of ""Magsafe."" We can use the analogy of car brands to best explain this. Even though BMW, Ferrari or Lamborghini did not invent the original car, they each have their own unique engine, materials and design. Similarly, ASAP Connect uses our own patent-pending magnetic technology with 18K gold plated connector design. We've solved significant issues found in the existing competitor designs and have created a more advanced technology for magnetic USB cables.</p></details><details><summary>Is there likely to be any manufacturing delays like all the other crowdfunded magnetic cables and adaptors which have all failed to deliver?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">Unlike all those other campaigns, we have already paid up front from our own pockets for the tooling cost and produced dozens of samples that have been sent to media worldwide for a hands on review. With the positive response of the final samples we will be able to begin production right after the campaign closes with no manufacturing complications.</p></details><h4 style=""text-align: center;font-weight: normal;color: #00abbe;"">FEATURES</h4>
<details><summary>What makes ASAP Connect better than other magnetic cables/adaptors in the market?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">There are many features, though the most important is that we are the first to incorporate our patent-pending magnetic connector technology and as our magnets are positioned at the exterior of both the cable and connector tip it will always connect easily. We are also the first to incorporate 18k gold platted connectors that have been are laboratory tested to last at least 38,000 connections.</p></details><details><summary>Can the magnets damage my phone in any way? </summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">No, we have completed months of laboratory and field testing to ensure the magnetic field does not interfere with the phone in any way.</p></details><details><summary>How strong is the magnetic connection?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">We've designed ASAP Connect to be strong enough to lift an iPhone 6 Plus so the magnetic strength is considerably strong so that it won't disconnect unless fair force is applied.</p></details><details><summary>Is it easy to remove the tip from the phone?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">The tip will stay in place from any general daily use even if the phone is dropped, yet it can be easily removed with just your fingers when needed.</p></details><details><summary>Does the ASAP Connect come with international warranty?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">Yes, all ASAP Connect orders will come with an international 365 day warranty.</p></details><details><summary>What is the length of the cable?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">The length of all ASAP Connect cables is 1.2m (3.94ft). You can purchase additional cables that are a longer 1.5m (4.92ft) for $15 on the Backerkit survey.</p></details><h4 style=""text-align: center;font-weight: normal;color: #00abbe;"">COMPATIBILITY</h4>
<details><summary>Does ASAP Connect support data transfer for Apple and Android devices?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">Yes, this also includes tethering.</p></details><details><summary>Can I plug ASAP Connect into my laptop, computer, car charger or power bank?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">ASAP Connect is compatible with everything your existing USB cable is, so it will work with all devices that are USB compatible. However it is not compatible with any audio functions such as your Lightning headphones, speakers or Apple Play.</p></details><details><summary>Will ASAP Connect affect the charging speed?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">ASAP Connect will not alter any device's charging speed and can handle the maximum charging speed for mobile phones.</p></details><details><summary>Can I connect a MicroUSB cable with an Alpha tip or vice versa?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">No, ASAP Connect's different device versions are not cross compatible due to their unique connector prong configurations.

ASAP Connect will allow you to connect your phone or USB devices to your cable quickly and seamlessly. The patent-pending magnetic technology coupled with superior materials including rare earth neodymium magnets, 18K gold plated connectors, aluminium shield and nylon braided cables, ASAP Connect will change the way you connect your phone forever.

For all inquiries, please contact us through email : hello@chargeasap.com


 



Sick and tired of flipping your cables back and forth to connect it on the right side? We were too, so we engineered ASAP Connect to have dual reversible connectors. This means first connection every time on both ends of the cable. Now you can connect your phone even in the dark! Check it out in action below.

Device/Phone (output end) 
   
 
 



Through years of design and material testing, we've reduced the size of the ASAP Connect tip to only 10mm (0.39"") wide which fits perfectly into all your Apple and Android devices. We've tested the tips on over 100 phone cases and found it fit on all of them. The only exception is for some phone cases which have a protective flap on the charging port which may not be able to close properly with the tip in place. This also the case for the Samsung S5 phone due to its inbuilt protective flap.



What truly sets ASAP Connect apart from other magnetic connectors is its unique bevelled and concave magnetic connector design on both the tip end and cable head end.
Through this careful 360° exterior positioning of 2 strong neodymium magnets on both ends, the tip only needs to be within the magnetic field of the cable end to be quickly attracted and connect seamlessly. 
Competitor designs require the tips to be correctly aligned inside the cable head which requires guidance to be connected correctly if missed. Competitor designs also use weaker magnets and require a very perfect alignment of the cable and tip for a correct connection. See if you can guess which is ASAP Connect below. 

Don't be fooled by the similar external look of competitor cables, ASAP Connect (on the right) will connect correctly even if the tip is flipped 180° due to both the strong neodymium magnets having their polarity perfectly positioned and the unique outward and concave magnetic connector design. 
 



 

We've added an adapter perk which is based off the same technology as the cable. The advantage of the adapter is that you can swap between your existing cable and the magnetic cable by simply snapping on or off the adapter. Please note that we highly recommend the cable over the adapter due to the adapter combined with your existing cable being heavier than just the ASAP Connect cable head on it's own. A heavier cable head means it is more likely for the magnets to disconnect during use.
So far we are offering the adapter in the colors silver and gunmetal. We may offer down the track the colors rose gold and gold if we see a good response for the adapters. 
When the adapter is attached to your cable the LED light will stay on permanently when connected to a power source. This is different to the cable LED light which only turns on when connected to your phone.
Please note: you do not need to purchase the adapter to use the current ASAP Connect.

We've tested the cables on dozens of Apple and Android devices and have reported no compatibility issues. As long as you have any device that requires a Lightning connector (such as iPhone 6, iPhone 6 plus, iPad, iPad Mini etc.) or a MicroUSB connector (such as Android phones, mini speakers, headphones etc.) ASAP Connect will work every time.  
ASAP Connect is 100% compatible with all data transfer technology and fast charge technology including QualComm 2.0, QualComm 3.0 and Samsung Adaptive Fast Charge.
Please note that our cables are not cross compatible which means Apple cables are not compatible with Android tips and vice versa due to their unique connector properties. More information is available in the design section below.

 




You will be emailed a survey from Backerkit 14 days after your purchase, asking you to choose your options, purchase additional add-ons including tips, adapters, cables, sets and update your shipping address. Any new purchases from the Backerkit survey will not have an extra shipping charge and you will be offered the discounted rate per add on if you purchased a special or volume perk. You will have 14 business days to complete your survey from the day you receive it. If you have any questions after the survey has arrived please email hello@chargeasap.com.
 

We have evolved away from the traditional Lightning tip for Apple devices to create what we call the ""Alpha"" tip for 2 main reasons:
REASON 1: Have you ever had your Lightning tip start wobbling and eventually break off? This happens because the tip and base are made of 2 different components which break apart over repeated use. The Alpha tip solves this problem by integrating both the tip and base into 1 piece.



 
REASON 2: As Apple has not currently released their own magnetic Lightning tips, anyone seeking MFi certification from Apple will be refused as they will need to purchase the tips from an Apple MFi certified magnetic Lightning tip manufacturer which does not currently exist as of April 2016.
Without MFi certification most major retailers will not sell a USB cable for Apple devices and leaves the brand potentially open to law suits from Apple. The integration of the Alpha tip bypasses this certification process by not using the Lightning tip and allowing ASAP Connect to be manufactured and sold in major retailers worldwide.

 

Over the past 2 years we have been working closely with our manufacturer and possess both a registered design and utility patent-pending to protect our unique technology and its potential future applications. For further information regarding this please contact us via email on hello@chargeasap.com.
ASAP Connect has also been granted the following international certifications:

Beware of imitations, fake and low quality magnetic cables on the Internet. We have purchased samples directly off dozens of suppliers who claim to produce premium magnetic USB cables and performed both extensive laboratory and daily-use testing.
Here are our findings:
-  We have found many to not work as claimed, not be reversible, not transfer data nor charge your phone as it's maximum speed. We have even found some to create smoke and even damage your phone
- Many of these companies offer cables that do not have the following certifications: FCC, CE, ROHS and hence may not be approved for sale in your country. You should always ask the seller first if they have these international certifications before making a purchase
- Any company which claims to have Apple MFi certified lightning magnetic tips is completely false as of 27th April 2016. Apple has not currently produced nor approved any magnetic Lightning tips commercially and hence will not provide a MFi licenced magnetic Lighting connector to any company attempting to selling magnetic connectors as of 27th April 2016
- We have found many companies to use poor quality magnets that have weak magnetism or lose their connectivity over time due to no magnetic plating
- We have found many companies produce tip designs that are too thick and wide to fit on your phone case

ASAP Technologies is currently dedicating our research and development into a magnetic USB Type C connector as that is the future of phone and USB devices due to its faster speed. There have been significant challenges in this process as USB Type C cables carry a higher electrical current (3.1Amps vs 2.4Amps) which also presents an array of safety concerns. Currently no company in world has a commercialized functional magnetic USB Type C connector and certainly none with international certifications. We've launched a new campaign for a cross-device compatible cable that will have a USB-C tip compatible with a universal cable. You can find the new campaign here.

 
 


 
 



ASAP Technologies is a technology disruptor from Sydney to Los Angeles, who believe users should be the creators and innovators of products, not corporations seeking profit over practicality.

For all inquiries, please contact us through email : hello@chargeasap.com
 

We wanted to share ASAP Connect with the Indiegogo community here first because of the strong community of creatives, innovators and early adopters. With your help not only will you help kickstart the future of USB cables, you'll help bring us one step closer to furthering future applications of this magnetic technology to devices such as headphones and power outlets.

ASAP Connect is a simple idea, but we believe it can impact the world in a BIG way. We’re still a new start up that's been launched with our personal savings so that’s why we need your help. You can support by pledging and sharing the campaign on social media.






We've Partnered up with Backerkit!
We've partnered up with Backerkit for a smooth, streamline experience for the fulfillment process. Once the campaign closes we will send you out a survey that will help us to review and break down your pledge into the specific items you ordered. This is also where you will be given the options to choose the colors and connector types.
For all inquiries, please contact us through email : hello@chargeasap.com
 


CAMPAIGN
How do I choose my colour and connector type?You will be emailed a survey to your inbox via Backerkit at the end of the campaign within 7 days of the campaign ending.Can I choose a different ASAP Connect connector type and color for each cable I order, even if I order them together as 1 perk?Yes 100%, you can choose a different connector type and colour for every cable purchased. For example, this means if you purchase a TWIN PACK, you can choose 1 Apple and 1 Android cable in 2 different colours.How will my order be shipped?All orders will be shipping with the most suitable premium courier and that will vary between countries. All shipments will have tracking which will be emailed to you once the delivery has been shipped.Which countries do you ship to?We ship to all countries excluding the following which have been flagged by courier services as restricted or high risk: Belarus, Cote d'Ivoire, Cuba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Liberia, North Korea, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Syria & Zimbabwe. If you would like a shipment to any these countries we will make alternative arrangements that may cost more, however we cannot guarantee the shipment's arrival.Your campaign seems similar to these other crowdfunding campaigns ""ZAPTIP"" and ""ZNAPS"" which both are way past their delivery date and also have poor communication with backers so we're very concerned that they are ""scams"" and this campaign is too. This question has been added as we feel it's important we are 100% transparent about our project and to establish trust with our backers. We have been dealing with reports from the Indiegogo Trust and Safety Team in regards to these campaigns. Neither our product nor any member of our team is in any way associated with those 2 campaigns. Our technology is proprietary to ASAP Technologies and we have a utility patent-pending on ASAP Connect with patent filing number P103013.AU.So did your company actually invent the original magnetic USB technology? It is very important that all backers understand that this technology has been available in Asia since 2014. No company has claimed to have invent the original magnetic USB technology in the form of a patent so we will never truly know who originally invented it as magnetic power connection has been around for over 20 years and predates even the invention of ""Magsafe."" We can use the analogy of car brands to best explain this. Even though BMW, Ferrari or Lamborghini did not invent the original car, they each have their own unique engine, materials and design. Similarly, ASAP Connect uses our own patent-pending magnetic technology with 18K gold plated connector design. We've solved significant issues found in the existing competitor designs and have created a more advanced technology for magnetic USB cables.Is there likely to be any manufacturing delays like all the other crowdfunded magnetic cables and adaptors which have all failed to deliver?Unlike all those other campaigns, we have already paid up front from our own pockets for the tooling cost and produced dozens of samples that have been sent to media worldwide for a hands on review. With the positive response of the final samples we will be able to begin production right after the campaign closes with no manufacturing complications.FEATURES
What makes ASAP Connect better than other magnetic cables/adaptors in the market?There are many features, though the most important is that we are the first to incorporate our patent-pending magnetic connector technology and as our magnets are positioned at the exterior of both the cable and connector tip it will always connect easily. We are also the first to incorporate 18k gold platted connectors that have been are laboratory tested to last at least 38,000 connections.Can the magnets damage my phone in any way? No, we have completed months of laboratory and field testing to ensure the magnetic field does not interfere with the phone in any way.How strong is the magnetic connection?We've designed ASAP Connect to be strong enough to lift an iPhone 6 Plus so the magnetic strength is considerably strong so that it won't disconnect unless fair force is applied.Is it easy to remove the tip from the phone?The tip will stay in place from any general daily use even if the phone is dropped, yet it can be easily removed with just your fingers when needed.Does the ASAP Connect come with international warranty?Yes, all ASAP Connect orders will come with an international 365 day warranty.What is the length of the cable?The length of all ASAP Connect cables is 1.2m (3.94ft). You can purchase additional cables that are a longer 1.5m (4.92ft) for $15 on the Backerkit survey.COMPATIBILITY
Does ASAP Connect support data transfer for Apple and Android devices?Yes, this also includes tethering.Can I plug ASAP Connect into my laptop, computer, car charger or power bank?ASAP Connect is compatible with everything your existing USB cable is, so it will work with all devices that are USB compatible. However it is not compatible with any audio functions such as your Lightning headphones, speakers or Apple Play.Will ASAP Connect affect the charging speed?ASAP Connect will not alter any device's charging speed and can handle the maximum charging speed for mobile phones.Can I connect a MicroUSB cable with an Alpha tip or vice versa?No, ASAP Connect's different device versions are not cross compatible due to their unique connector prong configurations. This means a cable designed for Apple will not work with an Android tip and vice versa.Why have you not chosen to use the original lightning connector or have MFi certification? Apple has not released a magnetic lightning connector, hence it is not possible to apply for MFi certification and by producing a lightning connector that is not MFi certified, it leaves that company open to legal action by Apple. Any company claiming to have a MFi magnetic connector is not possible as of July 2015. You can ask the company for a PPID number from Apple as proof.Does ASAP Connect support QC2.0 or QC3.0? ASAP Connect will support up to 5V/2.4Amps, which is more than most cables available, but it will not support the maximum speeds of Qualcomm Quick Charge technology due to the 5V limit of the LED light. We have tested our cable with a QC2.0 charger and charge speeds are 10% slower from 0 - 50% battery power, and exactly the same speed from 50% - 100% battery power.

<li> Because Ockel computers have the size of a smartphone and weigh less than a baseball.</li>
<li>Because the Ockel computer turns any tv into a smart media center. It has never been easier to enjoy your favorite Netflix series, to stream with Kodi or to listen to Groove Music.</li>
<li>Because you can use our mini PC’s to get rid of your bulky PC tower at work, at home, or in your dorm room.</li>
<li>Because Ockel computers have a beautiful and unique design.</li>
<li>Because you can connect your mouse, keyboard, external hard drive or any other peripheral within the blink of an eye. Either wireless through Bluetooth or WiFi, or using one of the USB-ports.</li>
<li>Because these mini PC’s come with a pre-installed version of Windows 10, or, in case you prefer Linux, without any operating system installed.</li>
<li>Because our white and black dwarf are ready for immediate shipment and will be delivered within three business days. Worldwide.</li>
<li>Because by buying an Ockel computer you are contributing to a company that has a lot of ideas about doing things differently.<br/> </li>

<p>Ockel Sirius B easily fits into your pocket or bag. With a size close to smartphones such as the iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S7 you hardly realize you’re carrying a complete computer with you. Use the Ockel Sirius B  wherever and whenever you want. Connect an HDMI screen, the power adapter and optionally a mouse and/or keyboard and you are ready to go!<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488536507/j1f2gs0oeqenp5nq5xcv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/> </p>

<p>We know that no one likes to carry around heavy stuff. That’s why the Ockel Sirius B weighs only 120 grams (or 4.23 ounces) and the Ockel Sirius B Black Cherry 153 grams (or 5.40 ounces). This is less than the iPhone 7 Plus!<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488536671/ziqxj4x31rtndvudzcsq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/> </p>

<p>The Ockel Sirius B is equipped with two USB ports, an HDMI port, a Micro SD-card slot and a 3.5 mm audio and microphone jack. That means you can connect a keyboard, mouse, speaker or any other external device within the blink of an eye. <br/> </p>

<p>We designed the Ockel Sirius B in such a way that ventilation fans are no longer required. This unique feature combined with flash storage means you can enjoy working in silence and benefit from ultra-low power consumption.<br/>As the Ockel Sirius B Black Cherry has more powerful hardware components, the device also generates more heat. A regular passive heat sink isn’t able to cool this extra heat. As the Ockel brand is built around everything that can be found in space we decided to create an eye-catching heat sink with the pattern of the Canis Major star constellation. This is the star constellation where the Sirius B star can be found, the most well-known white dwarf star in our universe.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488536792/phktdlxo5uyynbribkro.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/> </p>

Please note that the Ockel Sirius B (white) only supports a 32-bit OS. The Ockel Sirius B Black Cherry also supports 64-bit OS.</p>

<p><strong><u>HARDWARE QUESTIONS</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>What Windows license is included?</strong></p>
<p>If you select a perk with OS included, your Ockel Sirius B or Ockel Sirius B Black Cherry will ship with a fully activated license for Windows 10. The Ockel Sirius B model includes Windows 10 Home 32-bit while the Ockel Sirius B Black Cherry includes Windows 10 home 64-bit.  </p>
<p><strong>Can I install another operating system on the Ockel Sirius A?</strong></p>
<p>The BIOS will be unlocked so theoretically any OS that runs on a x86 platform could be installed, including older version of Windows or Linux. However, alternative operating systems will need driver support, which may or may not exist, for all the hardware to fully function. Currently only Windows 10 will be supported via Ockel.<strong> Please note that Windows 7 is not a supported OS for the Ockel Sirius B &amp; Ockel Sirius B Black Cherry.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Can I reinstall Windows 10 if something goes wrong?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, using an HDMI display and USB media you can perform a Windows installation. At the Online Support Center you can find guides and assistance. Also, our technical suppor team is available for assistance, you can reach out to them at: <a href=""mailto:support@ockelcomputers.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">support@ockelcomputers.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Is the storage capacity limited to 32GB or 64GB?</strong></p>
<p>No. The Micro SD card slot is perfect for extending your memory. (SD cards up to 128GB's) And when 128GB isn’t enough, you have two USB ports to hook up an USB stick or USB external hard drive.  </p>
<p><strong>Can I expand the RAM?</strong></p>
<p>If you are interested in moving from 2GB to 4GB of RAM, please consider upgrading to the Ockel Sirius B Black Cherry. Adding or changing memory separately is not an option.</p>
<p><strong>How speedy is this computer?</strong></p>
<p>The performance of the Ockel Sirius B is excellent for normal day to day use. That means you can browse, email, edit documents, stream your favorite media and many other day to day tasks without any problem. We don’t like selling something as different from what it really is, so that’s why we tell you not to expect to play heavy 3D games with the Ockel Sirius B. </p>
<p><strong>What’s in the box?</strong></p>
<p>Every Ockel Sirius B comes with an HDMI cable, power cable and an AC-adapter compatible with the power outlets in your country. (Depending on shipping address).<br/>The Ockel Sirius B Black Cherry is shipped with an HDMI cable, power cable and universal AC-adapter, including an UK, USA and EU adapter plug. </p>
<p><strong>Is there a support website available? </strong></p>
<p>Yes, we have set-up a support section on our website. Please visit: <a href=""http://www.ockelproducts.com/support"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.ockelproducts.com/support</a> for drivers, downloads, solutions and more.</p>
<p><strong>How do I install Linux on my NO-OS Ockel Sirius B version?</strong></p>
<p>Please visit: <a href=""http://www.ockelproducts.com/support"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.ockelproducts.com/support</a> for the Linux Ubuntu installation guide and related files.</p>

<p><strong>Shipping and tracking information</strong></p>
<p>All Indiegogo orders for the Ockel Sirius B and Ockel Sirius B Black Cherry will be processed and shipped within one business day. Please note: it can take another business day before you receive your DHL tracking information, please make sure to check your spam-folder as well.</p>

<p>All available perks are ready for immediate shipping and will be delivered at your doorstep within 3-4 business days after your order has been confirmed! We use DHL as our carrier, please note that a signature is required and PO-boxes cannot be accepted. </p>
<p><strong>How can I order more than one Ockel Sirius A?</strong></p>
<p>You're loving the Ockel computers as much as we do! Unfortunately, currently the only way to order more than one Ockel Sirius B or Ockel Sirius B Black Cherry is by placing separate orders. For orders of 10 units or more, please reach out to our Product Manager Jesper Baumgarten (<a href=""mailto:jesper@ockelcomputers.com)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">jesper@ockelcomputers.com)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why is a different country showing when I am from the Netherlands?</strong></p>
<p>You probably filled-in 'Nederland', 'Holland' or 'The Netherlands' as your shipping country in the ordering process. Due to a small error in the ordering systems of Indiegogo the synonyms for 'Netherlands' are not recognized. Please reach out to us at support@ockelcomputers.com to resolve this issue</p>
<p><strong>Will there be any import duties or costs?</strong></p>
<p>For EU backers, no import duties apply. For all other backers, the answer will vary based on your country. Even if there is no import tariff, the shipper may charge you a documentation fee which is typically small ($10 or less). Any standard internal taxes (VAT, state/county sales taxes, etc.) will apply to all backers based on your local laws.</p>
<p><strong>Your campaign is over, can I still order a Ockel Sirius B or Ockel Sirius B Black Cherry?</strong></p>
<p>Although the official campaign time is finished, it’s far from over! We feel the ‘real’ part is just about to start.<br/>Our Indiegogo campaign is now in it’s ‘InDemand’ stage. This means you’re still able to order the Ockel Sirius B (original) and the Ockel Sirius B Black Cherry through Indiegogo.</p>
<p><strong><u>PRESS QUESTIONS</u></strong></p>
<p>I’m from the press, who do I have to contact?</p>
<p>You can reach out to our Marketing Director Nathalie van Wijkvliet (Nathalie@ockelcomputers.com) for all your press related questions or inquiries.</p>

Ockel Sirius B easily fits into your pocket or bag. With a size close to smartphones such as the iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S7 you hardly realize you’re carrying a complete computer with you. Use the Ockel Sirius B  wherever and whenever you want. Connect an HDMI screen, the power adapter and optionally a mouse and/or keyboard and you are ready to go! 


We know that no one likes to carry around heavy stuff. That’s why the Ockel Sirius B weighs only 120 grams (or 4.23 ounces) and the Ockel Sirius B Black Cherry 153 grams (or 5.40 ounces). This is less than the iPhone 7 Plus! 




The Ockel Sirius B is equipped with two USB ports, an HDMI port, a Micro SD-card slot and a 3.5 mm audio and microphone jack. That means you can connect a keyboard, mouse, speaker or any other external device within the blink of an eye.  


 


We designed the Ockel Sirius B in such a way that ventilation fans are no longer required. This unique feature combined with flash storage means you can enjoy working in silence and benefit from ultra-low power consumption.As the Ockel Sirius B Black Cherry has more powerful hardware components, the device also generates more heat. A regular passive heat sink isn’t able to cool this extra heat. As the Ockel brand is built around everything that can be found in space we decided to create an eye-catching heat sink with the pattern of the Canis Major star constellation. This is the star constellation where the Sirius B star can be found, the most well-known white dwarf star in our universe. 

We understand everyone is different. That's why we try to be as flexible as possible. We offer perks with the operating system Windows 10 pre-installed (OS perks), but also without (NO OS perks), for those who prefer to install Windows 10 or a different operating system themselves. Please note that the Ockel Sirius B (white) only supports a 32-bit OS. The Ockel Sirius B Black Cherry also supports 64-bit OS.
Please take into account that if you choose a perk without an operating system and you choose to install for example Linux, support will be limited. As Linux is an open source operating system, support will be limited to the drivers provided by the Linux community.
Anyone who needs some extra storage space is invited to choose a perk with a 64GB Micro SD-card.

Can I install another operating system on the Ockel Sirius A?

How can I order more than one Ockel Sirius A?

Why is a different country showing when I am from the Netherlands?
You probably filled-in 'Nederland', 'Holland' or 'The Netherlands' as your shipping country in the ordering process.

Will there be any import duties or costs?
For EU backers, no import duties apply. For all other backers, the answer will vary based on your country. Even if there is no import tariff, the shipper may charge you a documentation fee which is typically small ($10 or less). Any standard internal taxes (VAT, state/county sales taxes, etc.) will apply to all backers based on your local laws.
Your campaign is over, can I still order a Ockel Sirius B or Ockel Sirius B Black Cherry?
Although the official campaign time is finished, it’s far from over! We feel the ‘real’ part is just about to start.Our Indiegogo campaign is now in it’s ‘InDemand’ stage. This means you’re still able to order the Ockel Sirius B (original) and the Ockel Sirius B Black Cherry through Indiegogo.

The less common your password is with everyone else in the world, the safer you are. y!kes swipe, tap, and draw technology ensures that your password is totally unique to you, no doubts about it.<br/></span></p><p>y!kes Security app is a revolutionary mobile security
application that will change the dynamics for smart
phone users through the fusion of personalization, entertainment, and security.
y!kes eliminates traditional, limited, predetermined, alphanumeric passwords
and introduces innovative, personal, creatively based “free form gestures”
making the passcode possibilities virtually limitless. y!kes also protects all
of the user communication features in the cyber arena, giving the power of privacy
back to the people. Today, the word ""privacy"" has lost its meaning. The
mission of y!kes is to protect every smart phone and allow everyone to
keep their personal information private and secure.</p>
<br/><p><b>Is your mobile device really secure?</b></p>
<p>Can entering your
passcode be interactive and fun? y!kes Security is a mobile security lock screen ingeniously
merging mobile security and entertainment. Simply put, standard lock screens today are not
secure, yield a low memorization rate, and are not entertaining. We solve this
problem by intertwining your pictures and videos with the ability to unlock
your phone screen. This innovative solution allows your brain to memorize at a
higher rate. y!kes Security lock screen features high quality protection, with millions of passcode sequences. Do you have a habit of leaving your smart phone unattended? Well, you
never have to worry about someone accessing your personal information, as long
as you have y!kes Security. </p>
<p><b>How does it work
(entertainment)?</b> </p>
<p>Think of a memorable moment in your life in
which you have a picture or video on your smart phone. What if you could
transfer that memory on to your lock screen? With y!kes Security you can do
just that. Our Security lock screen allows the user to take pictures or videos
from their photo or video gallery and use them as a passcode on their phone.</p>
<p><i><b>Video: </b></i></p>
<p></p>With our video concept users can to upload a short video that can be broken up into four sections. In each section you'll create a free gesture password. As the user inputs their password the video plays. This allows users to have their most memorable moments as their lock screen.<p></p><p><br/></p><p><b><i>Gallery:</i></b><br/>With our galley concept users will upload 10 gallery photos to their lock screen. Each time you unlock your phone the gallery screen randomizes. This feature protects users from anyone pinpointing the area in which they are typing their pass code from a distance.<br/></p>
<p><b><i>Picture: </i></b></p>
<p></p>The picture concept allows users to upload a gallery photo to their lock screen, which after they engage the unlock button ask the user to draw their free form password on the screen. The possibilities are endless as the user can draw anything to unlock their smart phone.<p></p>
<p>Psychological studies have shown it is easier to remember something
you are interested in. Our patent pending solution to mobile security allows your
brain to memorize on a higher scale. Individualization of lock screens are
unheard of...until now. We provide high security and ease of access exclusively
for the user. </p>

<h3>""Be the change you want to see in the world."" <br/>-Ghandi</h3></div>","What is Smart Phone Records(SPR)?

SPR is the first App that allows you to distribute and sell your music straight from your smartphone without the use of a compact disk or a personal computer.
In a time where technology rules the world, smartphones help give us the ability to do things we only dreamed about doing not too long ago. Making music, for example, once consisted of renting studio time, and required funding for the project itself. But now, thanks to a major shift in technology, the possibilities are endless, and available right on your hand-held device. 
From production to mixing, sequencing to vocal compression, you name it-- there is most likely an app for it. As an independent artist, how do you get the music you've created from your Smart Phone or tablet to millions of listeners without relying on On-Line Distributors that we currently use to complete the process?



FEATURES:

Below is a list of features that will be available in the initial SPR App.  However, with your comments, suggestions and feedback we will continue to release updates and strive to make SmartPhoneRecords the new way to distribute music:


all genres (r&b, jazz, rap/hip-hop, instrumentals, dubstep, poetry, lectures, spoken word, freestyle, house, acoustic, alternative & much more)
free app (automatically exsposes you to millions of users)
create artist/group profile
include content/lyrics
album cover
release date and time
create barcode
set price for album or single
direct deposit to your bank account
no cd ripping
support and socialize with musicians from around the world
all digital studio quality sound on every recording
no mailing or shipping fee
release new music at anytime from anywhere
connect and sell music directly to your fans
load music straight to app from your smartphone
browse and preview artist 
""Facebook meets iTunes""
The traditional way of releasing music is rapidly evolving, widely due to the advancement in technology. Read on...

<h3>Why we need you ?</h3>
<div>
<p>SKIIOT powered by Coach4Pro is a product and associated service that will forever change the way we ski -
but not without YOU backing us on IndieGoGo. </p>
<p>Right now, SKIIOT is fully functional and it has been tested widely by professional skiers,
coaches and service staff. It’s endured the 50 km king race of Norway’s
Holmenkollen and sprinted with the best at FIS World Cup venues.</p>
<p>The endless hours of R&amp;D and prototype testing are now
over and we’re very clear on production technology needed to bring our
sportstech to market.<br/></p>
<p>Nevertheless, we are not a big company and therefore we rely on
you to back us up  and to help us financially to complete remaining steps towards mass production of SKIIOT– and to be
the first to receive the product straight out of production!</p>
</div>

<h3>Possible Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The product's functional performance has already
been widely tested by professional skiers, service staff and coaches. Through
countless rounds of testing iterations, we, with our distinguished R&amp;D
partners, have eliminated every variable that would have interfered with the
production of the ultimate skiing tool. It works everywhere, even in seemingly
impossible arctic conditions and circumstances. </p>
<p>Our partner Coach4Pro has done years of research and development in
professional sports performance analytics software, together we, SKIIOT and Coach4Pro, have made sure that the
analytics software is free of bugs and it functions like clockwork with SKIIOT. Wonderful user
experience feedback, great survey results, investors' belief, interest of
stakeholders and already received public and private funding all add to our
strong belief that SKIIOT production will continue to progress according to
plan.</p>
<p>We consider the component sourcing to be the only
predominant risk. We’ve benchmarked a wide range of sensors and carefully
selected only the ones that can deliver A) very tight accuracy and B) robust
functioning in arctic circumstances. Therefore it is a moderately relevant risk
that the suppliers run out of stock of these high accuracy components. However,
as a mitigation plan, we’ve started the search and negotiations for alternate
suppliers and, for SKIIOT’s most critical component, we are even going to
establish a stock of our own. </p>
<p>If a SW issue should arise, we already have
implemented and tested an updating mechanism that will ensure quick and fully
automatic updating mechanism of both mobile application and SKIIOT software.</p>

It delivers a doubled battery life as well as scratch and shock protection, all while maintaining the iPhone’s compact profile. No dongles, no adapters, no problem. Buy a Fuze case for your iPhone 7 or 7 Plus and bring back the jack. Don’t get tangled up in a mess of adapters. You should be able to listen to music with your favorite headphones whenever you want. When you purchase Fuze, you’re purchasing the freedom of choice -- something that itself should be free. Fuze’s differentiating factor is an industry standard 3.5mm audio out jack, just like the one every previous iPhone included. You bring your favorite earbuds, and you’re ready to rock.Our smartphones are important parts of our work and personal lives. We all know the anxiety that goes along with a battery that’s dangerously low. Don't get stuck in a situation where you can't send that business email, or you miss an important call from a family member. Fuze offers a built-in battery that can double your iPhone 7’s daily lifespan, making those anxiety-inducing moments disappear. Fuze uses advanced Sync-Through technology that allows you to sync or charge your iPhone 7 or 7 Plus without removing the battery case. That means you can charge both your iPhone and battery case at the same time, all while listening to music.No additional micro-USB cables or adapters like other cases force you to use. Fuze uses the Lightning cable that comes with your iPhone.The battery size for Fuze is rated at 2,400 mAh (iPhone 7), or 3,600 mAh (iPhone 7 Plus).The Fuze case is made of durable TPU and ABS plastics, the same plastics used in Apple’s own battery cases. Fuze not only allows you to use your headphones again, but also protects your phone from drops and scratches -- something Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, said was very important when buying a new iPhone 7.While most cases extend your phone on the bottom with a “chin” -- sometimes up to 15mm (.6 inches) -- Fuze keeps the slim design the iPhone is known for.

This campaign will finally bring to life a project that I have been envisioning for quite a long time, that is now manifesting through an inspiring collaborative effort. </p><p>Over the years I've worked with hundreds of organizations to create events &amp; community spaces. I have collaborated with exceptional groups committed to making the world a better place: Living the New Economy, the Victoria Public Market, Earthdance Festival and OUR Ecovillage, among so many visionary projects in this region. And they all share two common obstacles: their ideas only reach a handful of people at a time, and very little of their important work is archived.</p><p>Those currently having the greatest impact on the world, especially the media world, are those with virtually limitless resources. We are here to level the playing field and change the game by putting the best-quality, leading-edge engagement and media tools in the hands of the many leading thought leaders right here in our community. Stream Of Consciousness is about giving a big voice to people and organizations with big vision - a voice that can be heard above the din. </p><p>With your help, we can do this. We can create a broadcasting and media gathering platform to amplify the impact of inspiring and paradigm shifting ideas. Please look over the perk packages we've created - we’ve priced them to be huge value for your contribution, and then I invite youto please support this campaign in every way you can.

This campaign will finally bring to life a project that I have been envisioning for quite a long time, that is now manifesting through an inspiring collaborative effort. Over the years I've worked with hundreds of organizations to create events & community spaces. I have collaborated with exceptional groups committed to making the world a better place: Living the New Economy, the Victoria Public Market, Earthdance Festival and OUR Ecovillage, among so many visionary projects in this region. And they all share two common obstacles: their ideas only reach a handful of people at a time, and very little of their important work is archived.Those currently having the greatest impact on the world, especially the media world, are those with virtually limitless resources. We are here to level the playing field and change the game by putting the best-quality, leading-edge engagement and media tools in the hands of the many leading thought leaders right here in our community. Stream Of Consciousness is about giving a big voice to people and organizations with big vision - a voice that can be heard above the din. With your help, we can do this. We can create a broadcasting and media gathering platform to amplify the impact of inspiring and paradigm shifting ideas. Please look over the perk packages we've created - we’ve priced them to be huge value for your contribution, and then I invite youto please support this campaign in every way you can. Thank you!My best wishesJason 
Great ideas deserve a platform to reach the world.
But chances are you, or the creator you want to hear from...
won’t be speaking at TED this year.
We know that earth-shattering moments happen everywhere, all the time.  And we’re bummed that we don’t get to experience it, Aren't you?
While live talks and speakers are fantastic, we’re missing out if we can’t get there in person. It’s the future. We don’t NEED to be there in person, and often,
we just can’t. So let’s take the next step in the evolution of idea sharing together.  
The Stream of Consciousness Project
A video broadcasting platform that will allow authors, speakers, facilitators, coaches, inspiring thinkers and/or the people that host them to collaborate with local AND global audiences in real-time.
We're community organizers in Victoria, British
Columbia who create events and spaces that connect people to their communities. We want to expand these connections through 'streaming', which is broadcasting live to the internet.


What we’ve done so far

Bare Bones and still Awesome
In order to determine interest and test our
approach, over recent weeks we have scrounged together some equipment and
partnered up to deliver basic streams of an array of amazing events:

RE-BECOMING VILLAGERS: A Day with Mark Lakeman
SOCIAL ENTERPRISE CATALYST: featuring speaker Joel Solomon
MARKETING FOR HIPPIES: Green Your Business with Tad Hargrave

NETSQUARED VICTORIA: Crowdfunding For Causes 
IAN MACKENZIE: The Art of Crowdfunding
NETSQUARED VICTORIA: Technology Upgrade 101
STARHAWK: Creating Collaboration in Groups
And next up on our calendar:

LNE EDUCATION IN ACTION: Indigenomics

RANDY JONES: A Wildish Evening of Storytelling & Healing
PERMANOMICS: Practical Steps for a Kick-ass Life That Pays

And guess what? 
These events have shown us that people are hungry to engage with great
ideas and speakers.  Who can blame
them?  Look at that lineup of fantastic
content. Many of these speakers are out to change the world - and Stream of Consciousness will be a serious amplifier. 
Want to present?  What to participate?  Want to just help? Great! We need your help, that’s why we're here.

How can I help?
Jump in the stream, in the way that suits you best. 

We realize that everyone will look at this
project through different lenses, so we’re made it a bit easier to see how you
can help (and of course, how we thank you). Take a look and see if you fall
into one of these 3 realms:
1) You're Passionate About Big Ideas
You're someone who believes that knowledge is power. Your social media feeds are full of inspiring teachers whose ideas you love to share with your friends. You believe that your life is an opportunity to learn more about yourself and
others, and that Big Ideas have the power to change the world.

<li> Becuzz is a mobile, social-community for photo &amp; video sharing much like 
Instagram or Vine,
except for one big difference; when people click the heart-icon on a post, they 
are actually gifting a micro (financial) transaction. These transactions happen between one member's virtual wallet to another.  Each ""like"" is a micro-transaction that the sender chooses to gift from 1 penny to 5 
dollars. That amount is then applied to your Becuzz quick-fund campaigns. Fund from $10-$599 - fast! </li>
<li>Don't want to setup a CAM-PAIN? Then simply build your profile, leave 
your wallet OPEN and post your best shots.  You can even post your photos and videos to a 
private group.  Setup a private group of friends and share photos 'n vids that you only want them to see.  Ya never know what you could
get! <br/>
</li>
<li>Becuzz comes with a FREE, pre-paid Visa Card (available regardless of 
your credit history).  NO INTEREST CHARGES!  Your card  auto-links to 
your Becuzz account for instant access to funds and can be used where 
ever Visa is accepted. Imagine a credit card where MONEY GOES IN - NOT 
JUST OUT!</li>

For perks, we thought outside of the box.  Yeah we looked at Becuzz coffee mugs and tee-shirts, but what 
really has the most value for our early adopters... is followers.  So, we have chosen New Followers 
as Perks, becuzz when this takes off...you'll be glad you jumped in now!  





 Becuzz is a mobile, social-community for photo & video sharing much like 
Instagram or Vine,
except for one big difference; when people click the heart-icon on a post, they 
are actually gifting a micro (financial) transaction. These transactions happen between one member's virtual wallet to another.  Each ""like"" is a micro-transaction that the sender chooses to gift from 1 penny to 5 
dollars. That amount is then applied to your Becuzz quick-fund campaigns. Fund from $10-$599 - fast! 
Don't want to setup a CAM-PAIN? Then simply build your profile, leave 
your wallet OPEN and post your best shots.  You can even post your photos and videos to a 
private group.  Setup a private group of friends and share photos 'n vids that you only want them to see.  Ya never know what you could
get! 

Becuzz comes with a FREE, pre-paid Visa Card (available regardless of 
your credit history).  NO INTEREST CHARGES!  Your card  auto-links to 
your Becuzz account for instant access to funds and can be used where 
ever Visa is accepted. Imagine a credit card where MONEY GOES IN - NOT 
JUST OUT!

The app gets you financial gifts and the credit card lets you spend them, instantly!
    Innovation at it's best. The idea of an instant micro-crowdfunding mobile application is cool enough, but to link it directly to a credit card is genius.   You could potentially raise money and spend it within just a few minutes! A NEW FINANCIAL PRODUCT.  A pre-paid Becuzz Visa Card with no interest, no ""negative"" balance and it's yours regardless of your credit history ABSOLUTELY FREE?  BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!  You can actually TRANSFER money TO THE CARD (instantly) from the app!  After it clears, use your card where ever Visa is accepted.  Wow, a credit card linked to a quick-fund raising app, now that's cool!  But wait, there's more, more...Tired

Life Without Power



Known locally as ""Slum Island"" and crammed from end to end with shanty structures, Remba Island is a treeless strip of land on the Kenya-Uganda border of Lake Victoria.
Remba’s isolation means power, clean water and health services are poorly developed, scarcely distributed and extremely expensive. As a result, disease prevalence is high and daily activities are a great challenge.










Remba supports a population of 5,000+ fishermen who sail in search of the large fish catches no longer available nearer the mainland. Locals say the island can only support its population because inhabitants fish (and sleep) in shifts.

THE SOLUTION
Mobile Enabled Micro Grid
access:energy’s micro grid will convert the abundant sun and wind on the island into life-changing electricity to power lights, refrigerators, mobile phones and other appliances.
The installation will be remotely controlled and monitored through cloud software and smart meters developed by access:energy. No cash changes hands - connected 
customers use their mobile phones to top up pre-paid units of energy on individual lines.

I graduated from Faculty of Economics in Podgorica 7 years ago and since then I've been working mostly in marketing departments in companies in Montenegro, but also in an insurance company for a little over two years. I majored in Marketing and I spent last year of my college in Atlanta, GA. I was an exchange student at Georgia State University, Robinson College of Business. I loved my time in USA and I can't wait to get a chance to come back for a visit. I also played basketball actively for 7 years in Montenegrin leagues, and I am a teacher at a dance school here in Podgorica. <br/></p><p>I am trying to raise the money to start developing a smartphone application which will help you find Free WiFi anywhere in the world with 100% reliability. Here's the summary of how app will work: Let's assume you already have it on your phone and you travel abroad and don't want to use roaming cause it's usually way too expensive. You turn the GPS on, you open the app, it shows you location and pinpoints all the places around you where you have Free WiFi. You click on one of the places and it shows you the route to the place, the app will be integrated with google maps. The promise of the app is that no matter what city you're in, you will have a place that offers free WiFi within 15 minutes walk. 100% reliable, 100% ad free and completely free of charge, this app will be a must have on your smartphone. TO BE CLEAR, THE APP WILL BE COMPLETELY FREE FOR ALL USERS UNTIL THE END OF TIME!!! There will be additional benefits in the app as well but I cannot go into more details without discovering the main framework behind the app and that would be exposing it too much, if you want to know more please contact me via social networks (I left links to my Facebook and twitter at profile page) or via email admir.rebronja@gmail.com.<br/></p><p>As we all know, pretty much everything starts with a need or a desire, and so 
did this. A couple of months ago I traveled with a group of friends to a
 Cuban salsa festival (yes, I dance salsa) and the festival was abroad. 
There was nine of us, and as soon as we reached our destination, and 
after a taxi took us from the bus station to the main square (apartments
 we rented were near the square), a sort of strange thing happened. At 
least strange to me at the moment. While we were dragging our stuff to 
the apartments, literally everyone took their smartphones out and 
started browsing for an open and free WiFi. Even myself, even though I 
made fun of everyone. The reason I found it strange and that I was 
making fun of everyone is that I thought is it possible that we're so 
addicted to the WiFi, to the internet? Rhetorical question obviously, 
cause we were 5 minutes walk away from our apartments where we had WiFi but 
we couldn't wait and we had to look for a connection while walking 
towards our accommodation. </p><p>But I wrapped up the application idea 
after another thought, and not only this particular situation I previously described. A month ago or
 so I was having a coffee with a friend and started talking to him about
 a business trip I had while I was working for an insurance company. And
 among the things I remembered was how difficult it was to find a Free 
WiFi spot while I was there, and then we started talking about how 
ridiculous the price of data roaming usually is and how WiFi is always a
 better option then your data plan which usually has limited high speed 
data and so on and so on and that's when it hit me. </p><p>This is where
 previous two events connected in my head and I started thinking about 
it, and trying to find a way around it, and thinking of  a way to make Free 
WiFi more accessible to everyone. And I got it, I came up with an idea 
for an application which will be free and a hundred percent reliable. I 
checked the market and there are only a few similar apps but none so 
focused and reliable because none of them had my point of view and was not developed on the basis that I am developing my application on. And then
 I decided to go for it. I started making more detailed plans, did some 
research, made a business plan and it all somehow fit together 
perfectly, almost as if it was meant to be.</p><p>And then came the 
money issue, like always right? And that money issue brought me here, 
with a little help from my friend from US who directed me here cause I 
shared my idea and plans with her. She couldn't help me personally so she 
suggested I try with crowd sourcing websites which I knew very little about, but with 
which I was so impressed after I looked into it with more details. And 
here I am now with big hopes and tons of optimism that this is gonna 
work out after all. </p><p>Before you read the rest of the story, I'd like to make one important
 notion. This is pretty much my last resort. I tried everything I could 
before this, even borrowing the money (and still trying) from family and
 friends but not that easy when you live in a developing country where 
average yearly salary is 5000 Euros. <br/></p><p>This
 money will be used for taking care of all expenses until the end of 
year when the first version of application should be developed. In order
 to have this app developed the way I planned it and in order to have a 
100% reliability at all times, it will take a full commitment until the 
March of 2016  just to this project. This means no additional income or 
job or activity, just this. This also means that I need funds to cover 
expenses in this period of time. These expenses mean life expenses for 
myself and a friend (rent, food, phone, transport) who's a programmer 
and in charge of the software development part (which is approx. 8000$),
 + the cost of hiring a freelance designer a couple of times (approx. 
1000$) , and a hardware + software acquiring, a new adequate laptop for 
the programmer friend who currently owns a slightly outdated one 
(approx. 1000$). This will enable me to have the app ready to download 
with first network of cities covered in March of 2016. I put 30$ as a 
reward sum but please feel free to donate whatever you can spare, any 
help is more than welcome, no matter how big it is. And yes, believe it 
or not, sums larger than 30$ are welcome too. :) <br/></p><p>One more thing, this is a big project. To have 
everything ready to go I'm gonna need 8-10 months of intensive work and 
commitment to nothing but this (ok, maybe a little dancing too along the
 way), and this is what these funds I'm trying to raise are for. To 
cover all of my expenses in next 8 months so that I can devote all of my
 time to making it happen. To have the app up and running I'll need more
 than 50,000 according to my plans and estimates, but I already have a 
plan on how to get the other 40,000 - the first 10,000 are crucial to 
get me going, and I am hoping you will find this idea interesting enough
 to support it. Just imagine a situation that no matter where you go, 
you just turn the app on and it leads you straight into Free WiFi. The 
goal is to cover the whole world, and start with Europe and USA. Imagine
 if we cover the whole world in 3-5 years? Nothing short of history 
making.</p><p>P.S. I am sorry I didn't go more into details about how 
specifically I'm going to pull this of, but since there are some similar
 apps out there already and it's an original and unique idea, I kinda 
don't want to just lay it out there so that someone with more resources 
can take the idea and run me over. Thank you for your understanding and a
 hopeful leap of faith.</p></div>","My name is Admir Rebronja, I am 30 years old and I live in Podgorica, Montenegro (South of Europe, former Yugoslavia). I graduated from Faculty of Economics in Podgorica 7 years ago and since then I've been working mostly in marketing departments in companies in Montenegro, but also in an insurance company for a little over two years. I majored in Marketing and I spent last year of my college in Atlanta, GA. I was an exchange student at Georgia State University, Robinson College of Business. I loved my time in USA and I can't wait to get a chance to come back for a visit. I also played basketball actively for 7 years in Montenegrin leagues, and I am a teacher at a dance school here in Podgorica. I am trying to raise the money to start developing a smartphone application which will help you find Free WiFi anywhere in the world with 100% reliability. Here's the summary of how app will work: Let's assume you already have it on your phone and you travel abroad and don't want to use roaming cause it's usually way too expensive. You turn the GPS on, you open the app, it shows you location and pinpoints all the places around you where you have Free WiFi. You click on one of the places and it shows you the route to the place, the app will be integrated with google maps. The promise of the app is that no matter what city you're in, you will have a place that offers free WiFi within 15 minutes walk. 100% reliable, 100% ad free and completely free of charge, this app will be a must have on your smartphone. TO BE CLEAR, THE APP WILL BE COMPLETELY FREE FOR ALL USERS UNTIL THE END OF TIME!!! There will be additional benefits in the app as well but I cannot go into more details without discovering the main framework behind the app and that would be exposing it too much, if you want to know more please contact me via social networks (I left links to my Facebook and twitter at profile page) or via email admir.rebronja@gmail.com.As we all know, pretty much everything starts with a need or a desire, and so 
did this. A couple of months ago I traveled with a group of friends to a
 Cuban salsa festival (yes, I dance salsa) and the festival was abroad. 
There was nine of us, and as soon as we reached our destination, and 
after a taxi took us from the bus station to the main square (apartments
 we rented were near the square), a sort of strange thing happened. At 
least strange to me at the moment. While we were dragging our stuff to 
the apartments, literally everyone took their smartphones out and 
started browsing for an open and free WiFi. Even myself, even though I 
made fun of everyone. The reason I found it strange and that I was 
making fun of everyone is that I thought is it possible that we're so 
addicted to the WiFi, to the internet? Rhetorical question obviously, 
cause we were 5 minutes walk away from our apartments where we had WiFi but 
we couldn't wait and we had to look for a connection while walking

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Product History</h3>
<p>We launched our first version of wireless scale - NutriScale - <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">for Android devices </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">in September 2012 and NutriCrystal in February 2013 for Android, iOS and Desktop applications.

<p>*The wireless scale can be power by the built-in rechargeable or four AAA batteries.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>Realizing NutriCrystal's full potential</b></h3>
<p>After receiving many feedback from our current customers and potential partners in the nutrition industry, we have realized that NutriCrystal has much greater potentials than just tracking daily nutrient intake.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Building the NutriPlus Fitness Platform</h3>
<p>We are now working with professionals from Nutrition, Sports and Medicine to create a mobile app and an online software platform to deliver nutrition solutions for:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Sports Athletes who wants to fine tune their performance</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">People battling against diabetes and weight related issues</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Infant nutrition intake monitoring</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">and more....</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Via the platform, members will be able to:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">view all premium health related contents</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">analyze how their life is impacted by their nutrition intake</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">interact with a registered nutrition specialist via online chat or video conference to get support.</span></li>
</ul>

<p></p>
<h3>External Connectivity</h3>
<p></p>
<p>For people who currently use FitBit, Withings Weight Scale or Nutrition tracking software, such as MyFitnessPal, you will be able to import and export your data between NutriPlus and other fitness platforms.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>We need your help</h3>
<p></p>
<p>To build the beta version of this comprehensive software, we need to hire two full time software engineers and one Graphical UI Designer for the next 12 months. And we are looking for help from you to:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">raise $25,000 to pay for a portion of our development cost</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">be our testers for six months and give us your valuable feedback</span></li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Your Reward</h3>
<p>Your financial pledge to our project will be immediately rewarded with fully working NutriCrystal Bluetooth Smart Ready Food Scales (<b>at 8.5~25%+ discount</b>) that already works with  our basic mobile apps, such as Nutrient Facts Table Builder, Daily Nutrient Intake Analyzer.. In addition, you will receive a free membership (per each NutriCrystal purchase) to the NutriPlus Fitness Platform to achieve better health via better nutrition management.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With your help and our engineering knowledge, we believe that we can create a health management solution based on the existing nutrition knowledge around the world to help people lead a better and healthier life by eating fabulous food everyday.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>About US</h3>
<p>Our company was formed by a group of engineering students from the University of British Columbia in 2010. After winning several school competitions, we decided to form a company in June 2011. The video below was recorded when Mayor Bloomberg of NYC announced us as the winning team in April 2011. Our goal was to create affordable healthcare solutions for the people around the world.

The World's First Bluetooth Smart Ready Food Scale. We have built it and now we need your financial support to further develop the software to achieve the scale's full potential.

Product History
We launched our first version of wireless scale - NutriScale - for Android devices in September 2012 and NutriCrystal in February 2013 for Android, iOS and Desktop applications. The original concept was to offer a nutrition tracking solution better than the current nutrition scales. The product has been well received and was recently featured @ Bluetooth.com


Product Comparison

*The wireless scale can be power by the built-in rechargeable or four AAA batteries.

Realizing NutriCrystal's full potential
After receiving many feedback from our current customers and potential partners in the nutrition industry, we have realized that NutriCrystal has much greater potentials than just tracking daily nutrient intake.

Building the NutriPlus Fitness Platform
We are now working with professionals from Nutrition, Sports and Medicine to create a mobile app and an online software platform to deliver nutrition solutions for:



Sports Athletes who wants to fine tune their performance


People battling against diabetes and weight related issues

Infant nutrition intake monitoring
and more....

Via the platform, members will be able to:



view all premium health related contents


analyze how their life is impacted by their nutrition intake

interact with a registered nutrition specialist via online chat or video conference to get support.






External Connectivity

For people who currently use FitBit, Withings Weight Scale or Nutrition tracking software, such as MyFitnessPal, you will be able to import and export your data between NutriPlus and other fitness platforms.

We need your help

To build the beta version of this comprehensive software, we need to hire two full time software engineers and one Graphical UI Designer for the next 12 months. And we are looking for help from you to:



raise $25,000 to pay for a portion of our development cost

be our testers for six months and give us your valuable feedback


Your Reward
Your financial pledge to our project will be immediately rewarded with fully working NutriCrystal Bluetooth Smart Ready Food Scales (at 8.5~25%+ discount) that already works with  our basic mobile apps, such as Nutrient Facts Table Builder, Daily Nutrient Intake Analyzer.. In addition, you will receive a free membership (per each NutriCrystal purchase) to the NutriPlus Fitness Platform to achieve better health via better nutrition management.

Other ways to support us
If you are unable to contribute to our project financially, please do still support us by:

or any other ways you think can help us (email us at info@reflexwireless.com)



The Impact
With your help and our engineering knowledge, we believe that we can create a health management solution based on the existing nutrition knowledge around the world to help people lead a better and healthier life by eating fabulous food everyday.

About US
Our company was formed by a group of engineering students from the University of British Columbia in 2010. After winning several school competitions, we decided to form a company in June 2011. The video below was recorded when Mayor Bloomberg of NYC announced us as the winning team in April 2011. Our goal was to create affordable healthcare solutions for the people around the world. And we are very thankful that we have been able to turn our dreams little by little to reality.

<p>A design Icon brought to you by the family that gave you the Sydney Opera House.  This new Radio has just launched with its basic model in Europe. Jeppe Utzon has designed this perfect radio, which surprises in every aspect.</p>
<p>With it’s special engineered loudspeaker can you easily fill a normal living room, with crystal clear and loud music.</p>
<p>The DAB+ technology is developed with one of the leading providers of such modules.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why are we asking for your help:</strong></p>
<p>Help us to further develop our ROBIO radio so it can wireless stream music and be controlled by any tablet, androidphone or iPhone.</p>
<p>We want to make ROBIO 2.0 with built-in Bluetooth to be able to stream music from any smartphone, laptop or PC and at the same time are we are making an application for all operating systems, to convert your phone into ROBIO’s remote control.</p>
<p>Great Perks are given for funding.</p>
<p><strong>Zeniq supports good causes:</strong></p>
<p>Part of the profits from our new products will be donated to the RED CROSS. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the funding used for:</strong></p>
<p>Funding is used for the following development:</p>
<p>-       Tooling amendments to improve sound quality by making the product heavier              and accommodating new electronics.</p>
<p>-       Application design and development</p>
<p>-       Bluetooth chip development and integration of the current Robio software.</p>
<p>-       Test samples</p>
<p>-       Pilot runs</p>
<p>-       Small Mass Production to overcome quality problems.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why will this be a success:</strong></p>
<p>DAB+ is an emergent market, but nobody is supporting it with high quality sound at affordable prices made by famous designers. Most radios on the market are overprices and under featured. We want to make consumers happy and feel that they really got their money worth.  </p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">To break that vicious cycle, MGov has been using 'old' technology

— to implement a two-way communication channel with respondents, gathering data
and sending out information for public policy evaluation, monitoring and civic
engagement. Even though cell phones are everywhere, internet and data plans are

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We allow people to express their demands for and assessment of public
services directly, without intermediaries. We provide a low-cost way to
rigorously evaluate the impact and effectiveness of alternative policies and

civic engagement and empowerment initiatives. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">NOW, WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT!</b></p>

additional mobile-based survey at a major Brazilian capital about the quality

<p><strong>QUEM SOMOS NÓS</strong></p>
<p>Todos nós crescemos em São Paulo, no Brasil, um dos países com as oportunidades básicas mais desigualmente distribuídas. O Brasil recém completou 30 anos de democracia. Se alcançamos estabilidade institucional, o mesmo não é verdade no que diz respeito a serviços públicos de qualidade. Ainda faltam para nós as ferramentas básicas para identificar as demandas dos cidadãos e a sua avaliação das políticas oferecidas.</p>
<p>Criamos a MGov baseados na premissa de que essas ferramentas poderiam ser disponibilizadas através de um instrumento que já existia. Mesmo em comunidades vulneráveis, a maioria dos domicílios tem ao menos um telefone celular. No entanto, a maioria das linhas ativas ainda é pré-paga. Nós precisávamos ser baseados em mobile, mas não fazia sentido pensar em um app para smartphone quando era preciso alcançar todo mundo. Por essa razão escolhemos uma solução analógica – SMS e chamadas automáticas de voz – para avaliação de poíticas, monitoramento e mobilização. Até hoje, nossas soluções impactarm positivamente a vidade de mais de 1.600.000 brasileiros, oferecendo elementos fundamentais para o desenho de políticas públicas e ações de impacto social de melhor qualidade. Nossos projetos englobam educação, saúde, soluções financeiras para a base da pirâmide, mobilidade urbana e orçamento participativo.</p>
<p>Nós vivemos na era do terabyte: escolhemos tudo, o tempo todo. Mas quando se trata de representação, ainda vivemos na democracia do bit; a cada quatro anos, somos convidados a contribuir com uma decisão binária: você quer esse cara, ou aquele outro? O nosso sonho é que as soluções que nós oferecemos possam ser ao menos parte do que é necessário para quebrar esse ciclo vicioso e tirar a levar a nossa democracia também à era do terabyte.</p>

Imagine if you didn't have a voice in decisions that are critical to your daily life, such as what school to attend or send your children to, what hospital to go to when feeling sick, or what transportation to take to work everyday. Imagine if, from night to day, you lost your voice. How would you feel? Millions of people worldwide feel like that. This is because, for these people, public services are the only available resource for

WHAT WE DO
To break that vicious cycle, MGov has been using 'old' technology
to give a new voice to people. Taking advantage of the worldwide usage of
mobile phones, we use analog technology — text messaging (SMS) and voice calls
— to implement a two-way communication channel with respondents, gathering data
and sending out information for public policy evaluation, monitoring and civic
engagement. Even though cell phones are everywhere, internet and data plans are
not: in the developing world, the lion's share of active lines are prepaid.
This is why one cannot rely on smartphone apps when it comes to public policy
and social impact.
We allow people to express their demands for and assessment of public
services directly, without intermediaries. We provide a low-cost way to
rigorously evaluate the impact and effectiveness of alternative policies and
for monitoring pilot initiatives with agility. This allows for the fine-tuning of
policies – in order to closely match the needs of those who they benefit –, and for large-scale
civic engagement and empowerment initiatives. NOW, WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT!
With the right funding, we believe that we can scale up our operations,
allowing us to have a bigger impact. To achieve this, we want to build up our
team so that we can further develop our products and services. This means we
must keep investing in our platform, not only to raise the quality of the
services we provide in Brazil, but so that we can also provide those services
worldwide. Most importantly, we want to keep experimenting, in order to cater
to progressively more challenging settings while keeping our solutions
cost-effective.
With this campaign we want to fund 3 innovative initiatives which
haven't been tried out before, divided into 3 goals:
(1) Raising USD 15,000:
we can provide a mobile-based survey at a Brazilian slum (favela) about
the quality of local public services, identifying the priorities for policy

(3) Arrecadando USD 120,000: + vamos desenvolver uma ferramenta mobile adicional para pesquisas a qualidade dos serviços públicos locais em uma grande capital brasileira, representativa ao nível do bairro.
Por que? O bairro é o primeiro contato de cada cidadão com a sua cidade, e a democracia não pode fiuncionar se os cidadãos não tem voz sobre o que acontece na sua vizinhança. Em uma cidade como São Paulo, seriam necessárias 125 mil entrevistas para entrevistar os cidadãos com os níveis usuais de confiança e margem erro, o que é caro demais utilizando as metodologias tradicionais de coleta de dados. Nós podemos fazer melhor com o telefone celular!

QUEM SOMOS NÓS
Todos nós crescemos em São Paulo, no Brasil, um dos países com as oportunidades básicas mais desigualmente distribuídas. O Brasil recém completou 30 anos de democracia. Se alcançamos estabilidade institucional, o mesmo não é verdade no que diz respeito a serviços públicos de qualidade. Ainda faltam para nós as ferramentas básicas para identificar as demandas dos cidadãos e a sua avaliação das políticas oferecidas.
Criamos a MGov baseados na premissa de que essas ferramentas poderiam ser disponibilizadas através de um instrumento que já existia. Mesmo em comunidades vulneráveis, a maioria dos domicílios tem ao menos um telefone celular. No entanto, a maioria das linhas ativas ainda é pré-paga. Nós precisávamos ser baseados em mobile, mas não fazia sentido pensar em um app para smartphone quando era preciso alcançar todo mundo. Por essa razão escolhemos uma solução analógica – SMS e chamadas automáticas de voz – para avaliação de poíticas, monitoramento e mobilização. Até hoje, nossas soluções impactarm positivamente a vidade de mais de 1.600.000 brasileiros, oferecendo elementos fundamentais para o desenho de políticas públicas e ações de impacto social de melhor qualidade. Nossos projetos englobam educação, saúde, soluções financeiras para a base da pirâmide, mobilidade urbana e orçamento participativo.
Nós vivemos na era do terabyte: escolhemos tudo, o tempo todo. Mas quando se trata de representação, ainda vivemos na democracia do bit; a cada quatro anos, somos convidados a contribuir com uma decisão binária: você quer esse cara, ou aquele outro? O nosso sonho é que as soluções que nós oferecemos possam ser ao menos parte do que é necessário para quebrar esse ciclo vicioso e tirar a levar a nossa democracia também à era do terabyte.
Por favor, nos ajude a espalhar a voz da democracia, dando uma nova voz às pessoas!

Obrigado!

<p>Imagine you are in a rush and you are running out of phone battery… Are you able to wait for 3 or 4 hours until your battery is fully charged?</p>
<p>Is it worth the risk spending all day without even being able to use your smartphone? Missing out on important calls, notifications or work emails?</p>
<p>What if there were a product which knows you are in a rush and how many problems you have to think about every day?</p>
<p>A product which, even if you forget to recharge it or you just don’t have long time, could be fully charged in the time it takes to have a shower?</p>
<p>It would be awesome, right?</p>
<p>This product already exists and its name is the  Flux.</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The Flux does not rely on gimmicks or unfounded claims, charging to full capacity in just 15 minutes</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;""> effectively replacing mains-charging, meaning that you never miss a thing.</span></p>
<p>At only 95g (3.35oz), the stylish cylindrical design ensures maximum durability and reliability for users, whilst its weight and footprint are small enough to carry in your hand, purse, or pocket.</p>
<p>Moreover, in comparison to conventional Lithium-Polymer, the life-expectancy for the Flux is three times longer! With conventional use (charged once per day), the Flux will take at least 1,500 days before charge degradation sets in; this is in comparison to the 500 - 800 days average of most mobile phones on the market today.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>FEATURES</p> <p>The Flux can be used to charge over 90% of current handset models available today; also, effectively, extending the life of older models who's batteries now fail to last an entire day, this is achieved through the USB port of the top of the Flux.</p>

<h3><b>OUR TECHNOLOGY.</b></h3>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">With Lithium Polymer cells the compromise that phone manufacturers have accepted is that in order to get the maximum energy in the smallest weight and size in a cell they have to compromise with cycle life (charge and discharge), charge time and decreasing safety tolerances (temperature range, voltage tolerance). </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Our Business was founded to develop a product line utilising the opposite end of the battery power/energy spectrum, focusing on fast charging characteristics of Lithium-ion developed for supercharging electric vehicles rather than energy density; the result is a cell that lasts 3x longer than normal lithium-ion cells and allowing the ability to rapid charge to 100% in under 15 minutes; bringing the ultimate convenience to the user.</span></p>
<p>The design focus has been around the charger technology and how to transfer that power safely and conveniently whilst keeping the size down to a minimum. This is where we have focused its engineering efforts to date.</p>

<p><b>We have also been redesigning the charging dock to be as slim as possible with a 30% lower profile and slightly smaller diameter. </b></p>
<p><b>As things get smaller they become significantly harder to design without introducing significant bi products (such as Radio Frequency noise). </b></p>

<p> </p>
<p>Most of the work undertaken has been in the board layout and reduction in size to fit the new slimmer dock design shown in the campaign, some internal changes have also happened with the planned removal of the fan to keep moving parts in the design to zero, this has been extremely difficult due to the amount of heat the charger generates and we are very pleased that we have achieved it :-)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The picture below doesn’t show too much but we have been working hard, we promise! Shrinking each component and reducing the height is challenging as limitations on current technology and price have to be taken into account.</p>

<p> </p>
<p style=""display: inline !important;"">There are always possible bumps in the road with any new product development. Maintaining the integrity of the design and high standards of quality in the materials and craftsmanship is important to us, as is being open to our backers about the schedule so our customers get their Flux as soon as possible.  </p>
</div>
<div> <p>We've worked hard to minimize risks by first designing, creating, testing, using and improving several working prototypes in-house so that any design flaws, however minor, could be identified and solved well ahead of time.</p>
<p>Next we've carefully selected and vetted our overseas manufacturing resources to ensure reliability, quality and scheduling is monitored and maintained throughout the process. Instead of having one factory make our product, we will source to factories that excel for each unique part and then bring everything together to assembly.  </p>
<p>Finally, before the first unit ships, we'll personally perform final quality inspections so every Flux meets our high standards of quality and performance. </p>
<p>All that said, there's always the possibility for unforeseen delays due to circumstances beyond our control. Inclement weather can affect shipping times. Ports can become backed up with surplus cargo. </p>
<p>But no matter what, we promise to keep you informed with frequent updates on the progress of our project. So check back often to see how everything is going, and thank you again for all your support!</p>

<div>
<p>If a new battery chemistry made it into full production tomorrow, the current industry estimate is that the next jump in battery technology will not reach consumers for another 3 years and this is only to double the current energy densities.

</div></div>","SAY HELLO TO THE FLUX!

The Flux is the World’s Fastest Charging External Battery with 
100% charge in just 15 minutes.
 Simply connect the Flux onto the Flux Power Dock and:
- In just 15 minutes, it is fully charged to 2,600mAh.
- In just 9 minutes there is enough power in the Flux to charge and iPhone 5s to 100%.
- If you are in a rush a quick 4 minute charge will give you enough power for half an iPhone 5s charge! 
AMAZING!
 
 Inspired by electric vehicle supercharging technology, the Flux prides itself on its ability to keep you on-the-go throughout the day by creating a portable power outlet in your pocket, without having to compromise!
 

Imagine you are in a rush and you are running out of phone battery… Are you able to wait for 3 or 4 hours until your battery is fully charged?
Is it worth the risk spending all day without even being able to use your smartphone? Missing out on important calls, notifications or work emails?
What if there were a product which knows you are in a rush and how many problems you have to think about every day?
A product which, even if you forget to recharge it or you just don’t have long time, could be fully charged in the time it takes to have a shower?
It would be awesome, right?
This product already exists and its name is the  Flux.
 

 


 
IS THIS YOU?
 
 
Finding and waiting for a small amount charge at a wall outlet is a constant struggle, whether in an office, pub, airport, café or even at home.
 
 

We identified and understood the necessity to create a product that differentiates because it innovates. 
When you are waiting on an important email, phone call, or SMS message, or using your phone for navigation, you do not wish to go without your device being at hand through fear of missing out (charging via a mains outlet, for example): the Flux is built with this in consideration.
Time is Priceless. How Much is Yours Worth?  
 

AS FEATURED IN:
 



“External chargers are handy, but remembering to charge them up can be a pain. Indie project Flux seeks to solve that by making a battery that can charge in just 15 minutes”
- Andrew Williams, TechRadar
                                   
“You can easily take it along with you on your daily travels since it’s light and portable and fits in your pocket. Just whip it out whenever you need to charge your phone and you’re good to go! And thanks to its durable construction, it can take a beating when tossed into your bag or in your desk at work.”
- Kristie Bertucci, Gadget Review
 

 
HOW TO USE IT


 
 

 
 

THE FLUX 


 
The Flux does not rely on gimmicks or unfounded claims, charging to full capacity in just 15 minutes effectively replacing mains-charging, meaning that you never miss a thing.
At only 95g (3.35oz), the stylish cylindrical design ensures maximum durability and reliability for users, whilst its weight and footprint are small enough to carry in your hand, purse, or pocket.
Moreover, in comparison to conventional Lithium-Polymer, the life-expectancy for the Flux is three times longer! With conventional use (charged once per day), the Flux will take at least 1,500 days before charge degradation sets in; this is in comparison to the 500 - 800 days average of most mobile phones on the market today.
 
FEATURES The Flux can be used to charge over 90% of current handset models available today; also, effectively, extending the life of older models who's batteries now fail to last an entire day, this is achieved through the USB port of the top of the Flux.
 
 

 
 

 
15 minute charge-time for 2,600mAh:
Providing a power supply for supported devices throughout the day.
True freedom of movement: 
Liberating you from time-consuming, tethered charging.
Universal connection: 
Supplied with both Micro USB and  Apple Lightning cables for peace-of-mind.
Long life-span with over 1,500 charge cycles: 
Lasting up to three-times longer than commonly used Li-Po rechargeable batteries.
Environmentally Friendly: 
Utilising components & elemental compounds which are environmentally conscious, the Flux is more recyclable than conventional cells.
Safety Concious: 
The combination of novel battery chemistry, high quality components & extensive rigorous testing, guarantees safety and product longevity.
The Flux excels in both style and substance: designed to be light, stylish, ultra-portable, & highly durable. A brilliantly dependable source of power, you can always rely on the Flux to keep you on-the-go: charging in just 15 minutes via the Power Dock.
 

 
UNIVERSAL CONNECTIVITY.

The  Flux is not limited to charging just mobile phones; with the USB port on the  Flux you are able to use the Flux to charge an abundance of items, including: wireless headsets, e-readers, wireless video game controllers, tablets (not necessarily to a full charge), electronic cigarettes, MP3 players, smartwatches, fitbands and Google Glass! 
You are also able to charge a majority of Apple iPads and iPods. With such a universal integration with existing mobile technologies and devices, the Flux is effective at mimicking a mains power outlet, despite its humble origins as an external power source.
 
OUR TECHNOLOGY.
 
 
With Lithium Polymer cells the compromise that phone manufacturers have accepted is that in order to get the maximum energy in the smallest weight and size in a cell they have to compromise with cycle life (charge and discharge), charge time and decreasing safety tolerances (temperature range, voltage tolerance). 
Our Business was founded to develop a product line utilising the opposite end of the battery power/energy spectrum, focusing on fast charging characteristics of Lithium-ion developed for supercharging electric vehicles rather than energy density; the result is a cell that lasts 3x longer than normal lithium-ion cells and allowing the ability to rapid charge to 100% in under 15 minutes; bringing the ultimate convenience to the user.
The design focus has been around the charger technology and how to transfer that power safely and conveniently whilst keeping the size down to a minimum. This is where we have focused its engineering efforts to date.
 
 

 HAVE WE DEVELOPED A NEW BATTERY?
Bringing a new battery chemistry to market in full production is one of the single most expensive things a business can do in industry, this is only beaten by the production of super capacitors. There is a significant technological leap between test in a lab and full scale production and on average takes 10 years to bring a new chemistry to market.
What our business has accomplished is to utilise new and advanced battery chemistry tested for supercharging electric vehicles and miniaturised the technology into a much smaller footprint, to allow a safe and compact transfer of high current power to the Flux, this is the key to our intellectual property.

 
 
 

DEVELOPMENT SO FAR.

We have also been redesigning the charging dock to be as slim as possible with a 30% lower profile and slightly smaller diameter. 
As things get smaller they become significantly harder to design without introducing significant bi products (such as Radio Frequency noise). 


 
Most of the work undertaken has been in the board layout and reduction in size to fit the new slimmer dock design shown in the campaign, some internal changes have also happened with the planned removal of the fan to keep moving parts in the design to zero, this has been extremely difficult due to the amount of heat the charger generates and we are very pleased that we have achieved it :-)
 
The picture below doesn’t show too much but we have been working hard, we promise! Shrinking each component and reducing the height is challenging as limitations on current technology and price have to be taken into account.
 


 
 
 
WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP.
 
We have spent months designing, testing & reformulating the Flux and its prototypes or order to deliver the most innovative, durable external power source whilst maintaining a reasonable price-point. 
As a result of our R&D, the Flux and its Power Dock are now ready for final testing, certification & full production, and we are in need of support from tech-savvy early adopters, who wish to remain at the bleeding-edge of convenience technology.

We like to remain as visible, yet transparent as possible with potential, and existing, customer. So, if you have any questions or enquiries, please contact us via email.
Alternatively, please support/contact us via one of our social media channels.
Any form of contact will be responded to as soon as possible.
 
RISKS & CHALLENGES.

 
There are always possible bumps in the road with any new product development. Maintaining the integrity of the design and high standards of quality in the materials and craftsmanship is important to us, as is being open to our backers about the schedule so our customers get their Flux as soon as possible.  

 We've worked hard to minimize risks by first designing, creating, testing, using and improving several working prototypes in-house so that any design flaws, however minor, could be identified and solved well ahead of time.
Next we've carefully selected and vetted our overseas manufacturing resources to ensure reliability, quality and scheduling is monitored and maintained throughout the process. Instead of having one factory make our product, we will source to factories that excel for each unique part and then bring everything together to assembly.  
Finally, before the first unit ships, we'll personally perform final quality inspections so every Flux meets our high standards of quality and performance. 
All that said, there's always the possibility for unforeseen delays due to circumstances beyond our control. Inclement weather can affect shipping times. Ports can become backed up with surplus cargo. 
But no matter what, we promise to keep you informed with frequent updates on the progress of our project. So check back often to see how everything is going, and thank you again for all your support!

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS.

Why was 15 minutes chosen as the time to charge to 100%?

15 minutes was chosen  as it provides a blend of the fastest charging battery, the smallest formfactor and the best price for you as the consumer. The problem with faster charging systems is the dramatic increase in required power and associated cost. 
At 15 minutes we utilise a 10 amp charge current, however a 1 minute charge requires a 120 amp charge! The same as an industrial welder!

  THE TOUCH CONTROLLED 12v CORDLESS DRILL DRIVER 

The latest most advanced power drill in the world today for the most advanced workshops.
A powerful, lightweight, professional power tool that
changes the rules of power tools for ever.
For the last 24 years I've been inventing and creating
power tools that have sold over 41 million units in over 45
countries and under brand names such as Craftsman, Ryobi, Ridgid,
Mastercraft, Macallister, i-drill, 909, GMC and many more.
A couple of years ago I set out to build something I've
wanted to build for the last 20 years.

A
power tool that operates intuitively by TOUCH. 
Why TOUCH you may ask, products that operate intuitively feel right, they generate confidence, something you should always have when using a power tool. 
I wanted it to be a tool that’s powerful, lightweight, credible and a must have for your workshop. My design direction was how a drill should operate and feel on the outside, not the way the components fitted on the inside. 
I need your help to achieve the goal of raising funds to assist in making the launch of this product a giant success. 
Please read all about my new TOUCH drill and make a pledge. 
You wont be disappointed.
I needed some new technologies

New enabling technologies were created or sourced that would allow the product to meet the high expectations of the most demanding trades person, yet be comfortable enough
for it to be the simplest tool in the world to operate.
I wanted to get rid of the old mechanical
copper based power management system that’s been used in a power drill since
they were invented 120 years ago.
The solution was in the very challenging field of quantum physics which is a very long way from working in a power tool R&D department. Quantum physics in a power tool sounds like we are in a movie. And the solution was the size of an ant. Goodbye copper switch, hello space age.
Fundamental to the project’s success was that the final products visual design had to generate enough desire that you would refuse to allow others to borrow it, that it operated flawlessly in every application you use it for. 
""No you can't borrow my TOUCH drill."" 

Invention comes from an ""idea"" to make a product better not just
because it has a famous name on the side


At the core of the new TOUCH 12v is the TOUCH enabling technology. 
Matching a perfect designed operating system we had to develop the shape of the TOUCH grip area for FORWARD and an area for REVERSE.
Exactly the way our hand works.
This new grip would give us the control both intuitively
and physically. The final handle shape end users love to hold. So good that you don't want to part with the product.
Getting rid of the cumbersome traditional copper switch inside the handle now means that every drill can now have the exact same “Perfect grip” size and shape.

Endless Lithium-Ion Power

An all new battery platform was invented using the most powerful 4Ah Lithium-Ion battery technology available. It is optimised to deliver up to 3X brute strength and 4X run time of our average 12v drill. 
The battery matched with a state of the art motor and purposely designed power curve would ensure optimum torque for drilling wood, steel or screw driving tasks.
To illustrate the performance gain we averaged a number of tasks versus our previous models built to show the new performance expectation.

Keeping the battery operating at its full capability is handled by a full electronic Diagnostic Charger. Charging the 4Ah in 60 minutes and 2Ah battery in 30 minutes. Wall mountable and for online retailers its multi-voltage. One product for all markets.






Total Flexibility in operation
The finely tuned power system delivered an added bonus, plenty of excess power. 
So we took a step into the unknown, and added a 1/2"" (13mm) keyless chuck.
Providing increased accessory capacity in the variety of applications the drill would achieve from a spade bit to a hole saw accessory the TOUCH drill can handle and not deliver just one hole.
The professional grade keyless chuck is manufactured
especially for me in France by my great friends at LFA.  

Finishing Touches
Some sweet finishing touches such as a bright LED Work Light,
Belt Clip, 17 +1 Torque control, Carry Strap, and Power Consumption LED complete the TOUCH 12v.


And just when you think you're finished, You’re reminded of being humble
My son, who always has a lot to say, asked ""Dad, why is the
gearbox on top. I can’t reach it with my thumb?"". Not knowing it could be, a reply
of “it’s not Son”,  “I'm moving it to the side “ followed.

He is a relay that enables to expand the infrared range. The cub becomes indispensable when Bearbot stands too far from the device (more than 5 meters) or is hidden behind an obstacle. He functions with two LR3 batteries. Your donation will help us starting the Bearbot breeding program.We currently offer a significant discount for early adopters to promote our project. Once Bearbot will be available for adoption everywhere, we will sell it for at least 149€ (for one Bearbot).Bearbot only needs to be trained once to learn the basic tricks. The mobile application tames him to identify the different remote control units:



Your bear is able to control numerous household devices such as: 


Bearbot replaces as many remotes as you wish. It is also possible to accumulate several functions in one gesture:
Bearbot can always learn more commands… After his first training session, Bearbot is already tamed. Your companion pays attention to every gesture you make:His senses allow him to detect your movements thanks to a revolutionary 3D gesture recognition sensor. 


Bearbot always displays the logo of the appliance you are about to control. You can rank and modify your devices list at any time on the app to simplify your navigation.Moving from one device to another is easy :  
A gesture from up to down allows you to switch to the next device  
A gesture from bottom to top allows you to switch to the previous device
Beyond your interactions, Bearbot can still surprise you with spontaneous behaviors: sneezing, dancing, falling asleep…In order to always get his full attention, you better keep Bearbot nearby. We recommend to have Bearbot close to hand. If he stands on the coffee table, you can use your foot but the motion should be performed accurately. Source : NSF International Household Germ Study, 2011According to a study conducted by NSF International, remote controls count among the top spots for bacteria at home.Bearbot prevents from providing a breeding ground for germs: by the time he is in place you no longer have to constantly manipulate him. When you’re cooking for instance, you don’t even have to wash your hands as you don’t touch your companion. Bluetooth’s, ZigBee’s and Radio's ranges are around 5 meters in a household environment.  In case Bearbot is too far from the device (more than 5 meters) or is hidden behind an obstacle, mini Bearbot relays the infrared information. The mini one functions with two AAA batteries. Bearbot’s cub is also part of the adoption program.Developing a technical product is a long process. Rewards should begin to be delivered by middle of 2017.

Established in December 2015, Mu Design imagines, develops and commercializes emotive design products. The head office is located in the Technoport of Belval, Luxembourg, an innovative business incubator. 

Our human-sized company achieved its first great success on a crowdfunding platform with Ulo, a cute interactive surveillance camera. 
Mu Design aims to be the most socially and environmentally responsible company: 



We promote the use of recyclable materials 
We favor technologies that are easy to update to avoid fast product obsolescence 
We give priority to local suppliers, subcontractors and production sites 
We don’t employ glue, potentially toxic, while assembling our goods 
We optimize our packaging to limit both raw material and energy consumption

What is the material of Bearbot?

Bearbot’s shell is made of 100%
recyclable plastic.



How many devices can be controlled by Bearbot?

You can replace as many remote
controls as you wish. Simply add them via the training app.



Is Bearbot available in another color?

No, Bearbot isn’t a polar bear. The
main reason is that his screen remains black when inactive. 


Where should I place Bearbot?

As a loyal companion, Bearbot should
remain close to you. It’s best to
keep him within easy reach to capture his attention.


Which mobile devices can I use to set up and customize Bearbot?

The Bearbot’s training app works
with iOS and Android.


When is it necessary to use the cub?

Mini Bearbot acts as an infrared
relay. You should use him when the distance between Bearbot and the device
exceeds 5 linear meters or when there is an obstacle between Bearbot and the appliance
itself. 



Is Bearbot available in my country?

Bearbot works everywhere in the
world. We will be happy to ship it to any destination.



I’m having trouble making a contribution. What should I do?

<p>Photo Prompter - The Smart
Snap App that simply helps you to re-live emotions!</p>
<h2><br/></h2>
<h2>Me!</h2>
<p>Hi, I’m Frank, a hospitality professional that has worked in the high-end hotel business for the past 20 years. I enjoy technology when it works and like to find ways to do things more efficiently. I like to breakdown processes and rebuild them to understand where their weak spots are…and that’s how - applicable for my professional as also personal life - the idea of Photo Prompter came along:</p>
<p>At home, I like to take and review pictures of family and friends but find it really annoying to go through the endless <strong>camera roll</strong> <strong>with hundreds of ""homeless"" pictures</strong> to retrieve just that special shot when you need or want to share it.</p>
<p>Working in a hotel operation is multi faceted. With the help of today’s technology and advancements in the smartphone sector, I often take advantage of the camera feature to <strong>take pictures and instantly prompt actions</strong>, ie. send them to colleagues to follow up on observed deficiencies (e.g. the flowers are dying…snap…send to florist; the cables of that lamp need to be shortened…snap…send to engineering; dining at a restaurant…snap…great presentation of a dish that the chef could try out etc.etc.), the problem is: <strong>the current iOS camera tools are inefficient!</strong> </p>
<p>And so that’s what I wanted to create…something that will make life easier and more efficient…that’s what Photo Prompter is all about!</p>
<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2>Efficiency in managing and sharing your photos on iOS devices<strong> </strong><strong>(see screenshots in the Gallery section)</strong>
</h2>
<p><strong>Successful apps are either fun or they solve a problem! Photo Prompter solves a real problem!</strong></p>
<p>With all those camera apps on the market not one has achieved to make life easier on the device you are using. They rather make you perform more manipulations to share and manage your pics. Well, that’s where Photo prompter comes in.</p>
<p>The Photo prompter app lets you instantly, and once you have confirmed your last snapshot, manage and direct your picture depending on your intentions:</p>
<h3><strong>Did you want to take a pic and direct it to a folder in iPhoto?</strong></h3>
<p>Well, on your iOS devices, when taking a picture, you need to go back to the photo and open up the picture again to use it. Also, managing your pictures is cumbersome and inefficient. Photo Prompter will instantly prompt and provide you with the option of using your pic to place it in a folder (e.g. work, family, friends etc.). The app even lets you create new albums, designate a default folder/album, store multiple shots, select multiple folders you want your pics to be in (e.g. A snapshot placed into the ""Family Photo Stream"" as well as ""Kids"" folder) and even enables you to send complete albums. When receiving images in your email inbox, by tapping on the picture Photo Prompter will be featured so that you can easily direct them to you your designated folders. Evidently Photo Prompter syncs your pictures and folders accross your other Apple products.</p>
<h3>Isn't it annoying to always be immediately prompted?</h3>
<p><em><strong>First of all, Photo Prompter leaves you in total control by providing the following options:</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>A: Switch the prompter feature on and off</strong></em><strong> </strong>(when on, you will be prompted what to do with the photo everytime you take the picture). This is the flex mode where you can use the pic to place in an album, send by email, iMessage, to Calendar, to social networks, print, copy, file, or place in the camera roll etc.</p>
<p><em><strong>B: With the prompter feature on, select default folder</strong></em><strong> </strong>(all photos will automatically go into a defined photo album, e.g. Paris 2013 vacation)</p>
<p><em><strong>C: Photo confirmation photo on/off</strong> </em><strong> </strong>This immediate picture confirmation tool allows you to avoid saving fuzzy pictures that just take up a lot of space and time when deleting them on your camera roll (if you just want to shoot away, turn off the photo confirmation function for your action photos OR for a picture perfect shot, switch on this option to make sure you are happy with shot it before doing something with it)</p>
<h3>Examples:</h3>
<p><strong>Scenario 1</strong>: Maybe you are at a dinner and want all pics to go into one folder: Switch on prompter, create a default folder and done! All pics will end up in this folder and by sycn'd across your Apple devices as soon as you connect to a wifi network</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 2</strong>: On a business trip we get exposed to plenty of impressions that lead us to take a lot of pictures to capture the moment or the message. Leave your prompter mode on to prompt you into sending messages using multiple tools such as emails, calendar reminders, iMessage, Post-it or Memo notes or share on your social network sites.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 3</strong>: You have some spare time on your hands and hundreds of pics sitting in your camera roll you had always wanted to clean up. Switch the prompter mode on, go to the last pic taken, swipe your way back and start bringing some order into the chaos by easily deleting the poor shots, creating new albums or sending and posting messages using the various options.</p>
<h3><strong>What about sending messages to friends and colleagues to initiate reactions or prompt actions?</strong></h3>
<p>Photo Prompter even allows to instantly use the picture to send it via email and iMessage. There are also some cool new features like the reinterpreted version of the self-explanatory formal and pink “Memo” message or the more casual “ Post-it” note to the inboxes of your addressees. </p>
<h3><strong>Can I use Photo Prompter with my social media networks?</strong></h3>
<p>Snap, select and send to your preferred platforms...It’s all there and as soon as a new social media network emerges we will make sure that Photo Prompter will remain a first choice contributor to sharing your pictures within your networks. </p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><br/></h2>
<ul></ul>
<h2>Revenues derived from App sales:</h2>
<h3><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">App revenue in stream strategy and expenditure:</span></h3>
<p>The app will be featured for free on trial for the first 30 days (without credit card information required to be provided from the consumer). If the consumer likes the product, he will be charged US$ 0.99 to use the app for one year only after that via the App store.</p>
<p>As the app development continues (e.g. roll-out on other Android and other operating platform; adding video captures that can be sent; International language options ie. Chinese, French, German, Spanish etc.; cloud photo archiving tools and options.), the annual renewal fee will cover and include any upgrades to the app.</p>
<p>An expected 30%-45% will be reinvested into development and adding features to the app, 5% will be donated to charitable organization (a schooling project in Africa more expanded upon below) and the remainder will be used to cover any operating costs including salaries.</p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>The impact of Photo-Prompter is huge as there is a real niche for a smart photo filing and sharing app. Imagine cutting edge design with the simplistic functionality for the user in everyday usage (don't we love to take pictures with our smartphones...) = mass download potential!</p>
<p>Priority number 1: <em><strong>Simplicity</strong></em> (Instantly make photo filing and sharing on your iOS devices simple)</p>
<p>Priority number 2: <em><strong>Transparency</strong></em> in everything we do and a clear communication of what we are doing, why we are doing it, how we achieve it and where we want to go, e.g. App cost to the end user: remember that the app will be offered for free on trial for the first 30-days without requiring any credit card information. Following the trial period the user will have to pay $0.99 for one year of usage. This is real value for money AND the end user is always in control.</p>
<p>Priority number 3: <em><strong>Innovation</strong></em> and progress with state of the art design.<span> Regarding UI, we’ll go with the latest trend of flat UX; ensuring clean, intuitive and user-supportive design (like the ones you see in latest apps of vine, pocket, any.do etc.). The list of future</span> upgrades with added features is already in the works and getting longer...</p>
<p>Priority number 4: <em><strong>Ethics </strong>(Paying it forward).</em> We are committed to contributing 5% of all time app profits to a charitable organization.</p>
<h2>The Charitable Organization</h2>
<p>I consider myself to be extremely fortunate being able to live the live I chose to live and feel obliged to help those in need. I have, however, over the past years developed a certain hesitation to help large charitable organizations as I find them to be too large, inefficient and intransparent. The charitable organization I have committed myself to a small family charity group supporting children education in Namibia.</p>
<p><strong><em>NaDEET</em></strong> (Namib Desert Environmental Education Trust) is a desert school camp that pursues the goal of teaching and familiarizing children with the local desert life with all its legalities. Support if provided to:</p>
<p>- build and maintain schooling and washroom facilities</p>
<p>- Operating a teaching kitchen</p>
<p>- Paying for food, school books, clothing and medical needs</p>
<p>- Care for 40 Orphans aged between 6 and 15 years after school with food, homework and activities to allow the children to follow the school pace and to complete primary school.</p>
<p>It is our commitment to support this charitable organization with all funds received should the funding goal have not been achieved to 75%, but don't worry...I am confident that we will manage to secure auffixient funds to kick off the app!</p>

</ul><p><a href=""http://wcodes.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""WCode"">WCode</a> is the answer.</p>

<p>An encoding schema <span>to convert digital data into literal words. It is </span>similar to bar-codes and QR-codes but different in that it is human readable.</p>

<h2>How is it useful?</h2>
<p>When asked for your telephone no. wouldn't it be nice if you had to say only four words instead of the usual ten. For example:<br/>""<span><strong><em>Cat Apple Mango Tomato</em></strong>"" against ""<span><strong><em>Nine Eight Zero One Two Three Four Five Six Seven</em></strong>"".<br/><br/>Also the chances of making mistakes are reduced since only carefully handpicked words that are simple and unambiguous and have distinct pronunciation are used.<br/><br/>Additionally check-summed WCode can be used to ensure correct delivery.</span></span></p>
<h2><span><span>Where can it be used?</span></span></h2>
<p><span><span>Where ever a human being is in-between a short digital communication across two non-connected computer systems. For example:<br/>You need to tell your friend your bank account number. Even a single mistake can be disatrous. If you cannot SMS or email - and you must use traditional methods like writing or voice, WCode may be the best option.</span></span></p>

</ul></div>","Update: Download - WCode for Windows x86 & x64I have always wondered - why do we all still have to go through the same troubles when exchanging numbers especially over phone by speech. Isn't there a better way.

How often mistakes are made when sending IDs like mobile numbers and email addresses
In absence of a pen, having to remember even a 10 digit number can become a difficult task
If there is no internet or pen-drive - how to send a small digital file?
What if correct delivery is a matter of life and death?
WCode is the answer.

What is WCode?
An encoding schema to convert digital data into literal words. It is similar to bar-codes and QR-codes but different in that it is human readable.

What does it do?
Converts data like Numbers, Email addresses or URLs and even small digital files into a bunch of words.

How is it useful?
When asked for your telephone no. wouldn't it be nice if you had to say only four words instead of the usual ten. For example:""Cat Apple Mango Tomato"" against ""Nine Eight Zero One Two Three Four Five Six Seven"".Also the chances of making mistakes are reduced since only carefully handpicked words that are simple and unambiguous and have distinct pronunciation are used.Additionally check-summed WCode can be used to ensure correct delivery.
Where can it be used?
Where ever a human being is in-between a short digital communication across two non-connected computer systems. For example:You need to tell your friend your bank account number. Even a single mistake can be disatrous. If you cannot SMS or email - and you must use traditional methods like writing or voice, WCode may be the best option.

Applications:


Digital data over traditional media like Print and Voice

Telephone Number
FAX Number
Email Address
URL
Geographic Coordinate
Software Registration Keys
One Time Password (OTP)e.g. 2-Step verification keys

Substitute codese.g. Alpha-Numeric content of Barcodes & QR Codes

Encoded Identifierse.g. YouTube Video IDs & Shortened URL IDs

Small File and Raw Data
Formatted data (only the value fields)e.g. a medical report


– can be communicated as few words conveniently on:billboards, magazines, business cards, voice calls and announcements.


Memorizable Clipboard across non connected systems
Systems across which Copy-Paste is unavailable, WCode can be used to conveniently transfer data.e.g. FF B2 7D 76 34 54 <> Mango America Coffee Milk



Random Password
Computer generated – high entropy, random passwords can be encoded into WCodes which are easy to remember.

Complex Text
Complex names and technical terms like computer commands can be communicated with simple WCodes.

Foreign Language Text
Foreign Language text, even those written in a different script, can be encoded into WCodes.

Native Language Codes
Native language words can be used to encode into WCode.Thus accessible to non-English speaking populace.

Logographical WCodes
Logographs can be used against words of a WCode.

Hash verification
Short pieces of digital data like file hash can be verified quickly.Also, a logographical representation of the hash can be used which will make the visual comparison much easier.

Verified Communication
With a checksum embedded in a WCode the received data can be verified.

Resilient Communication
Critical communication can be made resilient to errors by incorporating Data Correction techniques.The resultant WCode will be longer but data can be recovered in spite of 'some' errors in communication.

Secure Communication
Can be used to establish encrypted communication protected by scrambled or custom dictionary or by extremely secure asymmetric key algorithms.

FAQ:



Is it a replacement to Bar-codes and QR codes?No, at-least not always.It is meant to be used where human beings are in the middle of a 'short' digital transmission.


Advantage over BarCodes?
Bar-codes cannot be read by humans and when the need arises: the alternative numeric or alphanumeric code, if present, has to be input manually which is tedious and error-prone.

How is it different from NATO Spelling Alphabet: 'Alfa' 'Bravo' 'Charlie' ...?
Spelling Alphabet codes encode only a single character (digits included). They do not require a machine to be decoded.Whereas a single WCode - Word encodes the binary bits that represent the message. Thus a single Word will represent more than one character.

Output length is longer than input message?
The length is to be compared in terms of number of elements.e.g. if 9801234567 - is converted to - Cat Apple Mango Tomatothis equates to: 10 against 4.Also proper Encoding format is to be selected for the Conversion.e.g. 9801234567 is a Decimal Number and not a String.The Number of WCode - Words is much lesser than the number of characters in the original message.This makes it more efficient than Spelling Alphabets like 'Alpha' 'Bravo' 'Charlie'.Additionally it can also contain a checksum which will ensure correct delivery.This may increase the length by one more word.

<h4><b>For Pharmacist</b></h4>
<p>The Smart PillBox is designed
for patient’s personal usage, but it would be adding great value if combined
with Pharmacy support. This is why this campaign added new Perk special for
Pharmacy customers, who like to lease PillBox to its customer. The Pharmacist
could give the patient more accurate medication instruction through APP, also
remind patient for adherence/compliance on pill-taken/refill activities, and create<b>s</b> loyalty to
Pharmacy. </p>
<p>We also allow the Pharmacist purchaser to design his or
her own remark label such as name or logo, which we could print before shipping
out.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4><b>For Family user</b></h4>
<p>We designed one special Perk package for family user.
Besides all the above  functions,
we are designing the internal sharing group, start with family members. This
group sharing is within MyPillTrakcer APP, which could enable family trusted
members to share Pill-taken and related information and encourage each other to
stick on medication adherence. </p>
<h4><br/></h4>
<h4><b>What is the challenge?</b></h4>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The challenge to Smart PillBox is how to make it smoothly
integrated with current human common behavior habit. This is generally hard to
accomplish with standalone Pillbox or Mobile APP. The recent getting mature Bluetooth4.0(BTLE)
technology give a feasible method of always connected with reasonable power
consumption. </p>

we are all too familiar with, has become a serious burden. An accident is a
stressful event that, for most of us, causes anxiety, fills our body with
adrenaline, and makes us lose our focus. When we exchange information, we need
to find the relevant documents and copy down lots of details, and sometimes, we
need to do this in the dark, or in the rain. The stressful conditions of a
motor vehicle accident make this an annoying, drawn-out process, which needs to
be completed while we stand in the middle of a busy street. We are risking our
lives every minute we are standing there. </p>
<p>The
Take It Easy team has developed an ideal service featuring an application that
does all of the work for you, in less than a minute. All you need to do is get
yourself out of the accident area as quickly as possible. </p>

companies that we have met with have already agreed to work with us. We are
continuing this round of meetings in order to build a network of insurance companies

Naturally, we will update you, and you will be first to know once this occurs.
We will then field the application in Israel, and immediately afterwards, once
we have a working model (this gives us a very significant advantage, as it
allows us to launch the application in other areas within a short time).  Next, we will begin working with the United States

<h1 style=""text-align: center;""><b>What is ""Take It Easy"" ?</b></h1>
<p></p>
<p>Motor
vehicle accidents are stressful and unpleasant experiences, to put it lightly.
After being involved in an accident, most of us become confused and tense. We
are unsure of what we are supposed to do, what comes next, and most of all,
which details we are supposed to obtain and exchange with others involved. </p>
<p>Take
It Easy is an application designed to replace the traditional information exchanges
that typically follow a motor vehicle accident. The currently accepted, yet
unsafe procedure requires us to spend a great deal of time standing on the
street, and we become frustrated when we find that we don’t know all of the
details that we are supposed to obtain. We waste valuable time looking for
relevant documents and trying to remember not to miss any important detail. If
the accident happens at night, it will be much harder for us to jot down all of
the details that we need from the documents that we’re given, after the other
party to the accident has spent a great deal of time tracking down these
documents. With Take It Easy, exchanging details takes less than a minute,
allowing us to leave the scene of the accident as quickly as possible. It keeps
us and the other drivers safer. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h4 style=""text-align: left;"">
<b>How does it work?</b><br/>
</h4>
<p></p>
<p>The
application is connected to a database of insurance companies that operate in
the relevant country, and it therefore has information on all of the drivers in
that country. If you get into an accident, all you need to do is open the
application, which will ask you to input the license plate number of the other
car that was involved in the accident. Then, the application sends an SMS to
the owner of that vehicle, which includes a code that you will have to enter to
get access to that driver’s personal information. After this information is
entered into the system, any relevant information will be sent to the email
that you registered with when completing the application’s initial
registration. The same information will be simultaneously sent to your
insurance company. The next time you check your email, you’ll find a PDF file
with all of the information you need, organized according to the insurance
office standards of your country of residence, including pictures and video
clips of the accident that can be added with the click of a button. Your insurance
agent will receive a copy of this report in his inbox or in a fax, in real
time. The entire procedure takes less than a minute, so that you and the other driver
that was involved in the accident can get off the road almost immediately,
while receiving all of the information you need in the most effective,
organized, and appropriate way. Once the license plate number has been entered
into the system, the application will automatically contact the towing service
used by your insurance company to tow the vehicle away from the scene of the
accident, if necessary. The more traditional and cumbersome way to exchange
information may become drawn out and problematic when it’s dark outside, when
it’s raining, or when it’s particularly hot, but Take It Easy is unaffected by
time, date, or weather conditions; whatever the road or weather conditions, it
simply gets the job done. </p>
<p>With
Take It Easy, you’re working quicker, more effectively, and most of all- safer.

A case that doesn't compromise on hardware compatibility, yet saves you space in an age where desk space is a premium. Our product is currently in the prototype phase. This IndieGoGo campaign aims to raise the funds needed to produce prototypes for testing purposes, as well as to send to hardware reviewers. When it finishes, we will be following it up with a campaign to do a production run of an estimated 1,000+ cases.We're shaking up the computer case industry with our useful features for gamers, hardware enthusiasts and industry professionals:
A short VGA, HDMI and branching power cable come with the case for reduced cable clutter. Less mess, less stress.


Rotated motherboard points the IO ports downwards for tidier cables. The motherboard is also raised up into the case to allow cables to go beneath it.


Carry handle makes transporting the case easy, from desk to desk or room to room.

The case has a very small footprint, leaving you with a much more pleasing work area, for all that important stuff you do.

The case has space for GPU's up to 10.5"", as well as:
 mATX or ITX motherboard
ATX PSU
Two 3.5? drives
Two 2.5? drives
GPU’s up to 10.5?
Low profile CPU coolers
Four 120mm fans

<p>It's not that we hate plugging in, it's that we
hate the whole concept of having a battery that needs attention everyday! Qitah
wireless charger is designed to be a natural home for your phone, it just
happens to charge the phone while resting. Place your phone on the Qitah at any skewed angle/portrait/landscape orientation - and always have one hand free!</p>
<p>You'll never even
realize you have a charger. It's freedom at last!</p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 1.17em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px;"">Ok. What's a wireless charger anyway?</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Ah! When your phone charges without plugging in a cable, it's called wireless charging. You just need to place the phone on the charger's surface and it charges through magnetic induction - no connectors!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.17em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px;"">Will it work with my phone?</span></p>
<p>Qitah is a wireless charger based on the Qi standard. It will work with any Qi compatible device like the Nokia Lumia 920, Nexus4, Samsung S4 (with Qi cover or QiCard), HTC Droid DNA, Nexus7(2013) or any device that can be made Qi compatible like the Samsung S4, S3, Note2 and the Lumia820.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.17em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px;"">So it's not like WiFi?</span><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Nope, wifi works over distance. Qi wireless charging is proximity based. WiFi like wireless power is still a distant dream.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.17em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px;"">Fine, but there are other wireless chargers out there..</span><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Absolutely, and:</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;""><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">a) Most have a single coil, which means you gotta align your phone to get juice, isn't that as bad as plugging in?</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;""><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">b) Their plastic surface would scratch the phones' back!</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;""><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;""><span>c) If they're flat, you don't get to see or interact with your phone </span></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left; margin-left: 30px;""><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">d) Inclined ones are bulky and so you'll still be wired on    vacation..WIRED..ON..VACATION!! AAARRGGGG!!</span></p>
<h4><span style=""font-size: 1.17em; line-height: 1.45em;"">So the Qitah is different..How?</span></h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;""><span style=""font-size: 1.17em; line-height: 1.45em;"">A three coil system and a cool 40 degree incline combined with a soft SmartGrip to hold your phone in Portrait/Landscape and my favorite - skewed angles - gives you the freedom to carelessly place your phone on the Qitah, without having it scratched!</span> </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;""><span style=""font-size: 1.17em; line-height: 1.45em;"">That means you don't even have to move your eyes from your Laptop/Mac/PC to get your phone to juice up! And you check out notifications/texts etc. without lifting your phone, one handed!  It's such a natural home for your phone, you'll never have to remember to charge!</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;""><span style=""font-size: 1.17em; line-height: 1.45em;"">Qitah is as slim and light as your phone and will collapse to a minimal and sensible 7 degrees to give you peace at night, and on vacation :)</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px;""><span style=""font-size: 1.17em; line-height: 1.45em;"">Oh, and it's built on Qi version 1.1 technology, that's the latest and best out there, you won't find this in most other wireless chargers!</span></p></span><p><span style=""font-size: 1.17em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">Sounds cool..but is it faster than my wired charger?</span><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Qitah delivers 5Watts  of power <span>(as mandated by the Qi standard). So it's faster/same as most wired chargers and slower than some. </span><br/></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;""><span>But when you have a Qitah on your desk, you won't be bothered. Qitah is a natural home for your phone, and just happens to juice it up while you're busy with other stuff.</span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">N4's are not fully Qi compatible which is why they have issues with Qi chargers (This is our understanding, we've had no discussions on this with the N4 manufacturers, so we might be wrong, although it's highly unlikely). </span></p>

""Delhi Engineer Wants to Make Wireless Chargers Actually Usable""




Qitah. Go Unchained!

If you thought wireless chargers were no good, you were right! If all they do is save you from connectors, keep your pockets locked.







It's not that we hate plugging in, it's that we
hate the whole concept of having a battery that needs attention everyday! Qitah
wireless charger is designed to be a natural home for your phone, it just
happens to charge the phone while resting. Place your phone on the Qitah at any skewed angle/portrait/landscape orientation - and always have one hand free!
You'll never even
realize you have a charger. It's freedom at last!
FAQs
Ok. What's a wireless charger anyway?
Ah! When your phone charges without plugging in a cable, it's called wireless charging. You just need to place the phone on the charger's surface and it charges through magnetic induction - no connectors!
Will it work with my phone?
Qitah is a wireless charger based on the Qi standard. It will work with any Qi compatible device like the Nokia Lumia 920, Nexus4, Samsung S4 (with Qi cover or QiCard), HTC Droid DNA, Nexus7(2013) or any device that can be made Qi compatible like the Samsung S4, S3, Note2 and the Lumia820.
So it's not like WiFi?
Nope, wifi works over distance. Qi wireless charging is proximity based. WiFi like wireless power is still a distant dream.
Fine, but there are other wireless chargers out there..
Absolutely, and:
a) Most have a single coil, which means you gotta align your phone to get juice, isn't that as bad as plugging in?
b) Their plastic surface would scratch the phones' back!
c) If they're flat, you don't get to see or interact with your phone 
d) Inclined ones are bulky and so you'll still be wired on    vacation..WIRED..ON..VACATION!! AAARRGGGG!!
So the Qitah is different..How?
A three coil system and a cool 40 degree incline combined with a soft SmartGrip to hold your phone in Portrait/Landscape and my favorite - skewed angles - gives you the freedom to carelessly place your phone on the Qitah, without having it scratched! 
That means you don't even have to move your eyes from your Laptop/Mac/PC to get your phone to juice up! And you check out notifications/texts etc. without lifting your phone, one handed!  It's such a natural home for your phone, you'll never have to remember to charge!
Qitah is as slim and light as your phone and will collapse to a minimal and sensible 7 degrees to give you peace at night, and on vacation :)
Oh, and it's built on Qi version 1.1 technology, that's the latest and best out there, you won't find this in most other wireless chargers!Sounds cool..but is it faster than my wired charger?
Qitah delivers 5Watts  of power (as mandated by the Qi standard). So it's faster/same as most wired chargers and slower than some. 
But when you have a Qitah on your desk, you won't be bothered. Qitah is a natural home for your phone, and just happens to juice it up while you're busy with other stuff.
I'm in :) How do I choose my Qitah's color and/or my QiCase/QiCard?
We'll send out a survey sometime after the campaign to ask for your choices. Qitah comes in Shadow Black and Feather White



Will the Qitah work even if I use a case on my phone?
Yes! Inductive charging works through all non-magnetic materials. So all plastic/rubber/silicone and other non-magnetic cases are not a problem.
For iPhone owners that use a case: You'll need to replace your case with the QiCase.


Why is there a separate perk for my N4?
N4's are not fully Qi compatible which is why they have issues with Qi chargers (This is our understanding, we've had no discussions on this with the N4 manufacturers, so we might be wrong, although it's highly unlikely). 
We've come up with a special solution for N4s which will ensure smooth functioning (No cycling issues)
Are there risks to this project?
Absolutely! Like all entreupreneurial endeavours, the path to success for projectQitah will be filled with trials and travails that might delay/end the project. 
But if our goal is hit, they reduce to a minimum. We've got our vendors aligned for all the components and that gives us good confidence of delivering on the perks. 
Whatever the case may be, I'll pull out all me horses to try and fulfill the perks on time.
 
The How And When Of Qitah!



Who's Me?
I'm Tapan, an Electrical Engineer from New Delhi, India. My passion for technology was rotting alone until I discovered a love for design. They both came together in projectQitah.
I Got By With a Lil Help From My Friends
While conceptualizing the Qitah, invaluable insights from friends and strangers revealed that plugging in was a minor pain point.
A bigger problem discovered was the need to remember to charge!  
Portrait and Lansdcape positioning are so 2012! I wanted my phone to work with the Qitah even in a skewed position..and it does now :) 
With that, I can blindly place my phone, making the Qitah a natural home for it!
When we worked with Paul Studio, a two time RedDot awardee, the focus was creating a clean and beautiful design that could make your desk proud. They designed for delight hidden in minimalism. The Qitah was ready for the big test.. Your vote!
We need to reach our goal in order to
a) Get a high quality injection molding tool made - About $25K
b) Get the necessary certifications - Another $15K
c) Manufacture the Qitah - $40K
Your contributions will help the Qitah get off the ground, and that would mean the world to young startups like mine who believe that great things are possible if only great value is imagined.
You'll stay in our hearts..we'll etch your name on our workshop wall in a cool Grafitti made by Delhi's young and promising Grafitti artists. Grafitti is new to India, and the artists focus on responsibly keeping Delhi happy and aware through their work.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My Name is Brock Rice and I am a 30 Year old Entreprenuer.  I've completed 7 deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan while serving 10 years as a Combat Controller in the United States Airforce.  I am currently studying business in University and have created a product that will eliminate ""power source"" worries of smartphone users around the globe.</p>
<p>My Campaign is about the production of disposable batteries that are specifically desgined to charge the Iphone, Ipad or Other smartphone devices that regularly run out of power at the most critical moments.  I can relate to the frustration of leaving a charger a home and having to make the choice of going without my device or purchasing a new pricey charging cable which ultimately ends up being the more costly of the two.  </p>
<p>My campaign strives to develop and produce disposable batteries that will be readily available at gas stations, Convenience stores and Airports around the world.  No more worrying when the device reaches the critical 10% battery warning with no charging ability near by.  A quick trip to the nearest store will provide a much needed charge while staying mobile.  No more carrying bulking items that will take up room in your purse or pocket.  a Quick Charge from one of these batteries will allow you to continue using your device as well as keep you on the move.</p>
<p>Contributers will help me finish the Research and developent of the product and take it from the design stage to the production stage.  I have a patent on the idea and have began preliminary resarch as to what is required, however I require additional funding in order to make the leap to the next level.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Research:</p>
<p>I am asking for $35,000 in order to complete the research and run an initial production of 1000-2000 units.</p>
<p>It is estimated between $10,000 to $15,000 for electrical circuit design that will meet specific charging criteria for smartphone devices as well as working prototype.</p>
<p>Tooling and initial production will cost between $15,000 and $20,000 and will be used to produce between 1000 and 2000 units for a segmented market to build credibility.</p>
<p>From there I plan to increase production and distribute the product domestically and internationally.</p>
<p>Perks will include free batteries for your smartphone device!!</p>
<p>If I do not reach my funding goal, I will use what funds are available to persue Research and the development of 3D Production Ready Cad Drawings that can be used to apply for a non-provisional patent.  From there I will negotiate for liscencing deals.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My Campaign will eliminate all worries that smart device users have when they leave their charger at home, or get stuck in the airport with no charging terminal.  The battery will be readily available for purchase at many convenient locations and will eliminate the need to stay glued to a wall or carry bulky items.</p>

If it is please use the quick summary! We'll make a better and easier video to understand soon!<p></p><p><b>FAQ At Bottom! Seriously, if you're skeptical, read it! We really thought everything through. Ask us anything!</b></p><p><b>EDIT FROM VIDEO: We will not be using Dubloons, we will add money to your account daily based on total bandwidth used, average daily GB stored for a month and a reliability and availability coefficient. Thanks for the suggestion!</b></p><p><b>QUICK SUMMARY FOR YOU TL;DRs</b></p><p>Almost all technology companies need bandwidth and servers. They need the servers to do computing and store data, and the bandwidth to bring that data to you. For example, Facebook uses servers to store your photos and videos, and uses the bandwidth to send those photos and videos to your computer. Piratebase makes use of your wasted computing power (old electronics) and wasted bandwidth to power our very own cloud database. It's very much like converting your computer into a torrent seeder, but it's more secure, efficient, and makes you money! That means Facebook could instead of buying servers, use thousands of your computers to power itself. You get free money for no work, software developers get access to cheap(est), reliable, and powerful cloud services  and hopefully PirateBase will convince people to keep their electronics or repair them so they can make money off of them!<br/></p><p><b>So first things first, how much can you make?</b></p><p>Well lets do some calculations!</p><p>Let's say X is the number of hours you don't use the internet per day.</p><p>Let's say Y is the number of gigabytes of hard drive you haven't used.</p><p>Lets say Z is your internet <b>upload</b> speed in mbps.</p><p>These are <b>very conservative</b> estimates.</p><p>If you got paid .06 cents for every Gigabyte our software uploaded for you (<b>half the price of Google Cloud Storage</b>),</p><p>and you got paid $.01 a month for every Gigabyte of files from our clients stored in your drives (<b>matches the cheapest storage provider</b>).</p><p>You would get paid around </p><p>((Z/8000) * 60 * 60 * 30 * X * .06)(.50) (efficiency coefficient -<b> conservative estimate</b>) + (Y * .01) * Z/24 per month!</p><p>So if you didn't want to do any math, assuming you have 5 mbps upload speed and 1 TB of free hard drive space, and spent 1 hours using the internet uploading things (most people download when they're browsing the internet).</p><p>You would earn <b>$47</b> each <b>month </b>from uploading, and <b>$10 </b>each <b>month</b> from storing files in your extra storage space! All for downloading some software!</p><p>Now let's say you had 20 mbps upload speed, you would earn</p><p><b>$187 </b>a month from uploading!</p><p>Your best situation would be if you had a many machines machine connected to your internet for a total of 16 GB RAM and 1 gbps internet speed (this is for you google fiberians!). You would earn a whopping </p><p><b><i>$9350</i></b></p><p>That's right. Close to <b>10 grand </b>for making use of your unused bandwidth! And remember, this is all while powering the <b>the most affordable cloud service</b>, while putting in <b>no effort</b>!</p><p>Don't you think that PirateBase might drive up demand for faster internet? That's awesome because everyone hates slow internet.</p><p>These numbers may not be completely accurate (but they are really conservative) due to down times in your ISP's, down times in our system, and not enough demand for PirateBase :(.</p><b>Now, If you're interested read on!</b><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><i>The Internet</i> is the single largest and most important development in human history, past, present, and future, but large internet corporations and the government are taking away your rights and privacy.

Every day your old gadgets run, you can be earning money by just selling us your unused bandwidth.

This can't possibly go wrong.""<br/></p><p>A: The great thing about our database is that we EXPECT that each node is very unreliable and have varying performance , so we designed our software to be reliable even with unreliable nodes! With a high level sharding, and the fact that each node CAN'T contain more than one packet size data chunk from each file, if they do go offline, our other nodes containing that same packet will replicate it. Only if all of the nodes go down at the same time BEFORE one of the nodes containing that packet gets a chance to replicate the packet then will that packet become unavailable. And we can even deal with that with our Self Protecting Packet Recovery System in which we store the parity bit of the horizontal bit position of a segment of packets so we can recover a lost packet out of a segment of packets. We can also do statistical analysis of each node's reliability and make sure that we replicate it enough that each packet is available a certain percent of the time, in our case 99.99 % which is on par with google and amazon.<br/></p><p>We also thought of a great way to deal with wildly varying performance hardware of each node. In the most basic sense, it self learns for each node based on the rate of requests it can handle, and each node has a queue of requests to handle. When the queue gets larger, the node exchanges  a highly requested packet with another node with a decreasing queue of packets with lowly requested packet.<br/></p><p>Q: I like your idea but I do not understand some things. How do you protect stored data on people's devices, and how are you going to use that device as cloud if it is offline most of the time? Or it has to be online all the time to actually make money?

The nodes basically only have a few functions, which is to respond to requests, to forward requests, and to check for authenticity, so its relatively easy on the hardware side. The data is encrypted in a layer on the client side, so yes, uploading would take longer than usual, but its good for security that all data is encrypted anyways.</p><p>Q:</p><p>Without knowing the first thing about cloud storage or data handling here are my comments ...</p><ul>

<p></p></div>","So we've gotten a lot of feedback that the video and a lot of this information is confusing. If it is please use the quick summary! We'll make a better and easier video to understand soon!FAQ At Bottom! Seriously, if you're skeptical, read it! We really thought everything through. Ask us anything!EDIT FROM VIDEO: We will not be using Dubloons, we will add money to your account daily based on total bandwidth used, average daily GB stored for a month and a reliability and availability coefficient. Thanks for the suggestion!QUICK SUMMARY FOR YOU TL;DRsAlmost all technology companies need bandwidth and servers. They need the servers to do computing and store data, and the bandwidth to bring that data to you. For example, Facebook uses servers to store your photos and videos, and uses the bandwidth to send those photos and videos to your computer. Piratebase makes use of your wasted computing power (old electronics) and wasted bandwidth to power our very own cloud database. It's very much like converting your computer into a torrent seeder, but it's more secure, efficient, and makes you money! That means Facebook could instead of buying servers, use thousands of your computers to power itself. You get free money for no work, software developers get access to cheap(est), reliable, and powerful cloud services  and hopefully PirateBase will convince people to keep their electronics or repair them so they can make money off of them!So first things first, how much can you make?Well lets do some calculations!Let's say X is the number of hours you don't use the internet per day.Let's say Y is the number of gigabytes of hard drive you haven't used.Lets say Z is your internet upload speed in mbps.These are very conservative estimates.If you got paid .06 cents for every Gigabyte our software uploaded for you (half the price of Google Cloud Storage),and you got paid $.01 a month for every Gigabyte of files from our clients stored in your drives (matches the cheapest storage provider).You would get paid around ((Z/8000) * 60 * 60 * 30 * X * .06)(.50) (efficiency coefficient - conservative estimate) + (Y * .01) * Z/24 per month!So if you didn't want to do any math, assuming you have 5 mbps upload speed and 1 TB of free hard drive space, and spent 1 hours using the internet uploading things (most people download when they're browsing the internet).You would earn $47 each month from uploading, and $10 each month from storing files in your extra storage space! All for downloading some software!Now let's say you had 20 mbps upload speed, you would earn$187 a month from uploading!Your best situation would be if you had a many machines machine connected to your internet for a total of 16 GB RAM and 1 gbps internet speed (this is for you google fiberians!). You would earn a whopping $9350That's right. Close to 10 grand for making use of your unused bandwidth! And remember, this is all while powering the the most affordable cloud service, while putting in no effort!Don't you think that PirateBase might drive up demand for faster internet? That's awesome because everyone hates slow internet.These numbers may not be completely accurate (but they are really conservative) due to down times in your ISP's, down times in our system, and not enough demand for PirateBase :(.Now, If you're interested read on!The Internet is the single largest and most important development in human history, past, present, and future, but large internet corporations and the government are taking away your rights and privacy. PirateBase wants to give the power of the Internet to the users. Software developers, this is the solution you've been waiting for: a cheap, scalable, and simple key-file datastore solution so you can concentrate on what you do best, making great web software.Who are we?We are creative, talented programmers located in Dallas with a passion for networks. We are trying to raise funds to fully devote our time to building the world's first decentralized key-file cloud database for software developers.What is it?For DevelopersPirateBase is a decentralized, patent-pending, secure key-file database with a simple API. It will be much cheaper than cloud storage options on the market right now especially for highly requested files, and will offer low latency, 99.99% availability, and unlimited throughput. Developers need not worry about their data being lost because the data will be securely replicated on multiple machines across the US (and other countries later on). It will offer the scalability of large databases managed by Google, Facebook and other tech giants without any initial capital cost. Secure encryption will ensure that not even PirateBase will have access to the information stored in the database.Cloud storage and networking specialists, wanna help? Contact us on the FAQ, we would love to hear your input and expertise.For Gamers and Techies and Computer UsersRent out your unused computer storage and bandwidth for our crypto-currency, in which you can then sell for cash! All you have to do is install our software, and watch your account balance grow! PirateBase will have the lowest bandwidth and processor priority, so it won't interfere with your work or play. You can use PirateBase to store your files. Our services are fast, secure, reliable, and most of all affordable. PirateBase Dubloons - no moreEdit: Due to a suggestion, we're not going to be using Dubloons, We add money to your account daily, and you can cash out at any time!Helping the Environmentcredits to BBC for this imagecredits to Metalicotransfer.com for this imageDid you know 70% of toxic waste comes from electronic waste, some of it completely working? Electronic waste is a huge problem for our environment. The US exports tons of electronic waste each year to developing countries, and locals burn this waste to extract precious metals from it. This can not be healthy for our atmosphere or the locals. PirateBase wants to change all of that. Instead of throwing away computers, why not convert them into a PirateBase node? Every day your old gadgets run, you can be earning money by just selling us your unused bandwidth. We hope PirateBase brings on a revolution to eliminate electronic waste, and what's better is that you'll get paid for helping the environment, while powering a safe, secure cloud database. It's a win-win-win!TimelinePatent-pending DesignThis is what our PUT request looks like. Initiating a put request will be simple with just three parameters, the file, the password, and the account key to be used for billing, and our servers will respond with your file key so you can access the data.Behind the scenes: The client tells our server the file size and SHA hash, and our server gives them a list of addresses to send to. The client then splits the file up into packets, and for each packet, it attaches a SHA hash to the packet before it for confirmation of correct delivery. The client then uploads each packet to separate nodes and those nodes will replicate and check for correctness. If anything goes wrong, our server and client will be notified, and the unsuccessful packets will be sent to different addresses. The client after successful delivery, then saves an SHA hash for authenticity. If a node goes offline, then another node downloads that file and hosts it. Our active database will always contain enough copies of your file so that it is always available.This is what our GET request looks like for lowly requested files. Initiating a get request consists of just 3 parameters, the file key, the password, and the account key to be used for billing. Our server will initiate our nodes to start transferring your files.Behind the scenes: Our server receives the request, checks it, and picks one of the groups of nodes that contain the file packets. The server sends the request to the first node, and the node then notifies the next node and starts transferring the file to the client. The next node does the same. When the client gets all the packets, it assembles the packets into files and checks for authenticity with the SHA hash.Multicast: Once your file gets to a certain rate of requests, another node then hosts the whole file and initiates a single source multicast. Clients then just needs the address of the multicast for download. When in multicast mode, you're billed by how long the file stays in multicast, not by the bandwidth. So you would be paying a fixed rate instead of paying other cloud companies for total throughput.All files are chopped into minuscule packet size data chunks and each chunk in a file is stored in different nodes so the whole cluster is more reliable because there is no single node of failure for each file and recovery is quick for each file if a node containing data from it goes down. We also have a protection mechanism to recover lost data in worst case scenarios when all nodes go down at the exact same time for a piece of data in a file. We firmly believe that this design will handle even the most unreliable of clusters.Why do we need money?Developing this software will require our complete attention and time. The money will go towards all the expenses of further developing and deploying PirateBase, including the hardware and maintenance costs. Can't donate, but want to help?Please thndr our video, and share it on your social media websites!

It all started with our CEO's uncanny ability to forget his phone everywhere. And when we say everywhere, we mean <i>everywhere</i>; home, office, bar, park bench, you name it. For most of us, our smartphone is a crucial tool that we can't go without. So if you ever leave your phone behind, you're most likely not going to go about your day without it, you will drive back and get it. We wanted to solve this problem. When conceiving the idea of Bringrr, we wondered what kind of devices were already available that could prevent us from turning around mid-trip to get our phones. After searching for a product that could possibly do this, we found only devices that leashed the phone to you, which could result in a lot of false alarms. That’s not the problem we wanted to solve. We wanted a device that could be left in the car and practically forgotten until it was needed. So we thought of things that are always in your car, and the first device that came to mind was a car charger. Light bulbs went off in our heads! It’s stationary, everyone needs one and it’s out of the way. Why should your car charger just charge your phone and do <i>nothing</i> else, is the question we asked ourselves. With that in mind, we got to work. Shortly after, Bringrr was born.</p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><b><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/492200/files/20140408010039-35604619fc3d61502c74fdf6c812f0e5_large.JPG?1396944039"" src="""" style=""""/></b></b></b></p><p><i>Aldo (CEO) looking pensive during one of our brainstorming sessions.</i></p><p><i>We then went a step further and asked ourselves, what about remembering to bring everything else? During our first brainstorming session, the answer almost came instantaneously; bluetooth beacons! The name “BringTags” was conceived even faster. We wanted BringTags to easily attach to things so Bringrr could search for them in addition to our phones. Our team didn’t stop there. We wanted to add other features to the tags that made them usable outside of the car. The problem of forgetting goes hand in hand with misplacing your things. So making BringTags able to find your misplaced or lost items was just the natural evolution of the Bringrr system. Adding a speaker to BringTags so we could find our misplaced items by sound, on top of using the Bringrr App to find items by distance, was our way of creating a complete system. We were very excited to tackle the challenge of making the age-old problem of driving away without your things, a problem of the past. This motivated us to act quickly and begin the design process to make Bringrr and BringTags a reality. After months of planning and engineering, we had the first prototypes.</i></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><b><b><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/492201/files/20140408010046-efd4b269b0b4ff9cac6abc9dd0dd011d_large.jpg?1396944046"" src="""" style=""""/></i></b></b></b></p><p><i>Testing the original Bringrr prototype.</i></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><b><b><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/556529/files/20140504140715-Canary__The_first_smart_home_security_device_for_everyone___Indiegogo.png?1399237635"" src="""" style=""""/></b></b></b></b></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><b><b><i><a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/bringrr/circuitry-behind-bringrr-bringtags"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Check out our Slideshare.</a></i></b></b></b></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><b><b><i><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/556529/files/20140504140715-Canary__The_first_smart_home_security_device_for_everyone___Indiegogo.png?1399237635"" src="""" style=""""/></b></i></b></b></b></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><i><b><i>How Was Bringrr Engineered?</i></b></i></b></p><p><i><i>Very carefully. The basic engineering concept behind Bringrr is simple.</i></i></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><i><b><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/492209/files/20140408010654-0eedb086cef280cd588171c66180ebc0_large.jpg?1396944414"" src="""" style=""""/></i></b></i></b></p><p><i><i>Bringrr block diagram.</i></i></p><p><i><i>We currently have a fully functioning prototype of Bringrr that works as shown.

If you still can't find your item, just activate the BringTag's built-in speaker to find it by sound.Ok, But What If I Still Can't Find My Misplaced Item?Chances are, it's lost. The good news is you are not alone! Just mark the item as 'missing' on the App. This will silently and discreetly put the entire Bringrr community on the lookout for your tagged item. When anyone with a Bringrr gets within range of your lost item, you will get a notification of its location; securely and anonymously. Your location is never shared with anyone else. Maintaining your privacy is very important to us.Wow, That's A Lot Of Distance Covered! Tell Me More.

I'm A Developer. Is Bringrr Open Source?Yes, you will be able to integrate Bringrr and BringTags any way you see fit on any app you want to develop. You will be able to sign up as a developer on our website and get access to the Bringrr API. Feel free to contact us if you have any questions.How Does Bringrr Work With Google Glass?Seamlessly. With Google Glass, all of Bringrr's features come alive in front of your eyes.If Bringrr notices that you’ve left something behind, Glass will tell you what forgot to bring.Assigning BringTags with Glass is easy. Just specify your item and the tag you want to use, and Glass takes a picture. 
If you misplace something, just ask Glass. You will be taken right to your item.


If a lost item you’ve marked as missing is found by the Bringrr community, Glass will guide you to the item's location.
If You Liked It, Then You Should've Put a BringTag On It!BringTags make the perfect addition to a thoughtful gift that is too valuable or sentimental to lose.What's The Story Behind Bringrr?We'd love to share it with you! It all started with our CEO's uncanny ability to forget his phone everywhere. And when we say everywhere, we mean everywhere; home, office, bar, park bench, you name it. For most of us, our smartphone is a crucial tool that we can't go without. So if you ever leave your phone behind, you're most likely not going to go about your day without it, you will drive back and get it. We wanted to solve this problem. When conceiving the idea of Bringrr, we wondered what kind of devices were already available that could prevent us from turning around mid-trip to get our phones. After searching for a product that could possibly do this, we found only devices that leashed the phone to you, which could result in a lot of false alarms. That’s not the problem we wanted to solve. We wanted a device that could be left in the car and practically forgotten until it was needed. So we thought of things that are always in your car, and the first device that came to mind was a car charger. Light bulbs went off in our heads! It’s stationary, everyone needs one and it’s out of the way. Why should your car charger just charge your phone and do nothing else, is the question we asked ourselves. With that in mind, we got to work. Shortly after, Bringrr was born.Aldo (CEO) looking pensive during one of our brainstorming sessions.We then went a step further and asked ourselves, what about remembering to bring everything else? During our first brainstorming session, the answer almost came instantaneously; bluetooth beacons! The name “BringTags” was conceived even faster. We wanted BringTags to easily attach to things so Bringrr could search for them in addition to our phones. Our team didn’t stop there. We wanted to add other features to the tags that made them usable outside of the car. The problem of forgetting goes hand in hand with misplacing your things. So making BringTags able to find your misplaced or lost items was just the natural evolution of the Bringrr system. Adding a speaker to BringTags so we could find our misplaced items by sound, on top of using the Bringrr App to find items by distance, was our way of creating a complete system. We were very excited to tackle the challenge of making the age-old problem of driving away without your things, a problem of the past. This motivated us to act quickly and begin the design process to make Bringrr and BringTags a reality. After months of planning and engineering, we had the first prototypes.Testing the original Bringrr prototype.Check out our Slideshare.How Was Bringrr Engineered?Very carefully. The basic engineering concept behind Bringrr is simple.Bringrr block diagram.We currently have a fully functioning prototype of Bringrr that works as shown. This was completely developed by our team from scratch, without using any off-the-shelf products. For the BringTags, we used the TI SensorTag development platform as a base to create the prototype. Since then, we have designed our own circuitry and developed the firmware, so BringTags communicate with Bringrr. The prototypes currently work with our early stage app. We have a functioning version of the Bringrr App for iOS that allows us to test our prototypes and make sure they work correctly. The Bringrr App(s) for Android and Google Glass are currently in the preliminary stages of development.Here is everything we have developed so far:Bringrr• Power circuit board developedBringTags• Bluetooth circuit board developedEnclosures• Original enclosure for Bringrr• Final enclosure for Bringrr & BringTagsHow Will My Contribution Help?The cost of manufacturing Bringrrs and BringTags becomes much less expensive when we meet volume order requirements for the components and devices. We have fully functional prototypes that we’ve carefully refined, and we’re nearly ready to begin manufacturing. This means all we need is to have a certain number of Bringrrs and BringTags spoken for before we can begin the process of manufacturing. Our manufacturing partner Poly-Products Industries is based in Hong Kong, and is able to produce all of our components in house. With over 30 years of experience manufacturing for Fortune 500 companies, they are proficient at producing high volume orders quickly, so they will be able to make as many units as we need.We can't wait to see where this amazing journey takes us.All thanks to you!- The Bringrr Team",58.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Today, every new computer 
has at least one USB3 port, which can be used to connect External Hard 
Disk, Flash Disk, Web Camera and plenty of other devices.However, in opposite to all previous USB devices, there is a  limit of maximum distance of 3 meters.This
 should be enough for 90% of USB3 applications, but what if you want to 
see your movie from other room? Or once you want to connect outdoor CCTV
 camera? There are 10% more percent of applications that require just 
more than just 3 m.Our device should be able to resolve this limitation.How?
 We have designed active repeater device, which just multiply the range.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><b>Proposed new library facility shown above!</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Rural Bremond Public Library started its life in an old school building leased by (and remodeled by) The Friends of the Library from Bremond ISD in 1999. Inelegible for grant funding as a leased facility, we purchased a smaller building with the help of loans from two volunteers, and obtained non-profit status. Another round of remodeling followed before opening the current building in 2001.</li>
<li>Tremendous growth since then includes an increase in out-of-town cardholders (weekend residents), and demand for more library services for residents/patrons: faxing, copying, notary service, and especially DSL internet service. </li>
<li>These needs run up against the loss of all state funding for libraries, and the loss of revenue from Bremond City sales tax. The city does donate free water and sewer services to the library, and funds the part-time librarian's salary. Bremond and Robertson County both do contribute to the library's general budget. Volunteers assist in every aspect of day-to-day operation of the library. However, supply no longer keeps up with demand.</li>
<li>The growth of the book collection is hampered by lack of space in the current building. <b>No more room is available for children's programs at this point, and donations languish in storage. Requests for community meeting space are  refused weekly in our current circumstances.</b>
</li>
<li>The feasibilty study we need will clear the way for other donations and grantwriting opportunities for our new location by testifying to the soundness of the building and its suitabilty as a library. The new library will offer 5,000 square feet compared to 1000 square feet in the old library.</li>
<li>Plans for the new library include increased space to house the library collection, a seperate computer room for children and adults, a community meeting center, and a reading room with coffee service (similar to larger urban bookstores). Increased space will allow room for after-schoolers, and programs like Story Hour and the Summer Reading program to expand. </li>

</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>

<h3><strong>Do I need a laptop if I have one of these?</strong></h3>
<p>Not at all, with our new technology you can use our device as a laptop or a tablet and our device comes with 2TB storage which is a lot more than any other tablet or laptop in this price range.</p>

<h3>What are the risks?</h3>
<p>We see minimal risks as we have a proven design, and our chosen manufacturing partner has completed projects just like ours for major companies. Our designs are copyrighted already and we will also apply for patents for our design internationally.</p>
<div>
<br/>However, with all technology there are always risks. In this case we believe we have identified all of the possibilities and are in a position where the only delay we foresee is a lack of funding to enable us to complete the project.</div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">The Impact</span></strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Your contribution will allow us to launch this brand new product during the latter part of Aug 2013 and at the same time, will enable us to compete with the big name companies in the industry. Our final products will be produced by the same manufacturers that have produced for Toshiba and other big brands so quality will be of the highest standards available</p>

</div></div>","The AURUS Diamond Dual 10.1 by Allotropes Design - The world’s first, dual touch screen Android tablet/laptop for anyone!
Ever wanted a dual screen Android tablet or laptop? Well now's your chance. By pledging support for our project, you can have your very own AURUS Diamond dual 10.1.
The AURUS Diamond Dual 10.1 allows anyone to multitask with 2 x 10.1” touch screen displays so you can watch a movie and surf the internet, check your emails and play angry birds at the same time or whichever tasks you want to perform at the same time.
We have been developing the AURUS Diamond Dual 10.1 from scratch in partnership with our manufacturers for the past 12 months, and now we are ready to release it to you. We'll fulfill all the Indiegogo pledges first, so if you're excited to get one, supporting us now is the best route to take to make sure you get your hands on one first!
 
We Need You
Without your help we would need to sell through our existing supply channels. This means :
We will have to sell at considerably higher prices

 

Our product will enter the market at much later time

 

It will come with fewer features

 

We wont be able to supply to as many geographic regions

By backing us now, you will be ensuring our development team can complete our goals and help us to realise the full potential of this great product. 
 

 
Is there anything else like this?
No. This is the first of its kind to be entering production and will be the first on the market with your helpful contributions.
Need some dual screen Apps?
We are currently developing special dual screen apps starting with an artist app, DJ & Music app and will continue to make apps for our dual screen tablets as you request them.
Do I need a laptop if I have one of these?
Not at all, with our new technology you can use our device as a laptop or a tablet and our device comes with 2TB storage which is a lot more than any other tablet or laptop in this price range.

 
How do I get one?
Simply pre-order one right here! As soon as the Indiegogo campaign ends, we’ll begin full scale production. And in very little time, you’ll have your very own AURUS Diamond Dual 10.1 delivered to your door.
 
Taking it to a new level..
Not only is the AURUS the first dual screen tablet PC, but for the first time ever we are offering you a device that will have 2TB storage built in and a battery life of 24 hours.
 
Why Indiegogo?
We're really excited to be bringing such an important and useful tool to designers, artists and many other potential users all over the world. Using crowdfunding just makes sense for everyone involved and helps us determine demand for our product
In order to keep the cost down, we need to manufacture in volume. Your contribution helps us create the units at the lowest possible price. The future of the AURUS is in your hands.
If you like the idea, but don’t want a new tablet then just show your support by pledging any amount, share this link with a friend, or both!
 
Your contribution
We have put a lot of time, effort and funds into our project, but like many things in life, not everything can be completed by just a few. You and your contributions will enable us to reach our goals. You will be an important part of a world first, enabling us to complete production of the world's first true dual screen tablet / laptop!
 

 
Where will your funding go?
We have already invested heavily in the development of our product. Your funding is the crucial link in completing our project and will be used to realise our dream of the world's first dual screen tablet to reach the market.
 
Use of Funds
We already have the funds required to complete our final prototypes and final testing and preperation for production. We need your help for the next step to actually produce the tablet and to get it out onto the market.


 
I don’t have room on my desk for another device.
No problem. The AURUS is ultra thin and light weight and after you start to use it, you will not want to use anything else.
 
Easy to use.
With dual screen display, using the AURUS as a tablet or laptop could not be easier. Giving you the ability to have two apps open at the same time and full screen make everything more easy to use.
 
Whats the operating system?
At the moment we are using Android 4.2 (the latest version) which allows you to have multiple user login if more then one person uses the tablet and allows you to swipe movies, images, documents and more from your tablet direct to your television.

Who we are.
Allotropes Design was formed in 2012 with its main focus on website design, grachic design and product design. Since the formation of Allotropes Design, we have been working on the dual screen tablet project, and the company has focussed exclusively on product design.
Allotropes Designs vision has now evolved to focusing on product design,  concept design, and in the creation of new technologies.

 
FAQ
Q: When do we get ours?
A: Our factory will be starting production in Aug so at this stage we plan to ship the first orders out to everyone in Aug
Q: How much storage does it have?
A: To start it will have 2TB built in Flash / HDD storage 
Q: How will you keep backers up to date?
A: We intend to be fully engaged with our backers as we move forward with the AURUS Diamond Dual 10.1, There will be frequent updates and progress reports. Once our Indiegogo campaign is over we’ll continue to share our progress as we prepare for production and beyond. We love sharing information and education, and we just think the entire process of building things is exciting! We’re happy to share as much as we can too.
Q: Will it work anywhere?
A: For International Backers: Of course! We’ll include adaptors and the plug we’ve chosen is a universal 120v/240v. We want to make sure everyone can use the AURUS Diamond Dual 10.1.
Q: How much is shipping?
A: Shipping is FREE. After the Indiegogo campaign closes, we’ll have our website set up so it will display the estimated arrival dates for each order.
 

 
 
What are the risks?
We see minimal risks as we have a proven design, and our chosen manufacturing partner has completed projects just like ours for major companies. Our designs are copyrighted already and we will also apply for patents for our design internationally.

However, with all technology there are always risks. In this case we believe we have identified all of the possibilities and are in a position where the only delay we foresee is a lack of funding to enable us to complete the project.
 
The Impact


Your contribution will allow us to launch this brand new product during the latter part of Aug 2013 and at the same time, will enable us to compete with the big name companies in the industry. Our final products will be produced by the same manufacturers that have produced for Toshiba and other big brands so quality will be of the highest standards available
 
Where do we ship?
For Indiegogo orders ONLY we will ship to over 220 countries world wide. Please ensure the address provide is the address you want us to ship to.

<h2 class=""western"">What is BTHive?</h2>
<p>BTHive is a torrent indexer and DHT search engine. It is a Free and Open Source Software software for the web. Users will be able to search for files, get magnet link, comment, rate and bookmark files.</p>
<h2 class=""western"">Why are we making it?</h2>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""> We all use torrents for sharing files. BitTorrent protocol is a popular protocol for sharing large amounts of data over Internet. It relies on peer-to-peer file sharing rather than a central server to download data. 40% of Internet data traffic is torrents. Usually we find the torrent/magnet link of a specific file that we needed from any torrent indexing websites or search engines. DHT search engine is one of the alternative method to find the files we need.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""> </p>
<h3 class=""western"" style=""margin-top: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;""><em><span lang=""en-US"">Community perspective of torrent indexing:</span></em></h3>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">There are numerous torrent indexing websites where users can upload their torrents. Other users find these torrents, download files with them and (optionally) give feedback about the quality of files. So, there is an active community around sharing torrents files and magnet links. Like any community, it is an 'intelligent crowd'. They help to keep the quality of file sharing trustworthy. Also these indexers host rating and comments data along with file information.</p>
<h3 class=""western""><em><span lang=""en-US"">Present Problem:</span></em></h3>
<p>But Torrent indexers constantly face shutdown threats from anti-torrent 'alien' organizations. Yes, they are obviously not human! they don't understand how humanity works! Either these websites shutdown or run away from one host to another. There are several problems happening because of this. Huge data regarding torrents are lost overnight.</p>
<h3 class=""western""><strong><span lang=""en-US"">We have to stop running!</span></strong></h3>
<p>That is the reason we wanted to make BTHive. It is a combination of torrent indexer and DHT search engine.</p>
<h2 class=""western"">How does it work?</h2>
<p>BTHive is a web app. There is a DHT client in the back-end which work as a node in DHT network. So, it can receive incoming requests and log it. On the front-end, there will be a torrent indexing web site where users can search for torrent files like any other indexing websites out there. Users can also register to comment, rate, bookmark torrents.</p>
<p>BTHive is also a decentralized platform. Different BTHive installations - we call them ""Hives"". Its a concept similar to diaspora social networking software's ""pods"". Users can register into any hives. Different hives can add other hives in their network. These hives share their indexed data, rating, comments with each other. So when a user search for a specific file in a hive, she is also searching the 'hive network'. Since files have unique fingerprints, comments and ratings get identified with them. These comments and rating also get synchronized in a hive network.</p>
<p>If one hive is shut down, the content it made will be unaffected. This property of BTHive makes it impossible to destroy the network and keep the community intact!</p>
<p><strong><span lang=""en-US"">So more BTHive installations = more powerful the network is!</span></strong></p>
<h2 class=""western"">Technology:</h2>
<p>Front end is written in Ruby on Rails. DHT back-end will be in ruby itself. Although different DHT implementations are being tested currently. Contents are synced in the network using an implementation of salmon protocol.</p>

TNSP SportsNet is a video production company that
specializes in web-based sports shows. 
We were founded deep down in a basement in Atlanta, by 2 former sports
radio professionals who were tired of the short-sighted vision of our
employer.  After years of attempting to
open our former employer's eyes to the upcoming rise of internet television, we
decided to set out on our own and create original sports shows and release
them on our website, TNSP SportsNet.
We launched our website in August of 2010 with 1 man and his
camera and 2 men with a passion for all things sports.  When we launched, we had 3 original shows in
production: The ReDonkulous, Knockout and The Round Table.  Since that
time, our programs have been extremely well received, but now it is time to
take it to the next level.

What We Need 
We need to raise $3,500 for the next 4 months of production
of our signature program, The ReDonkulous.  This money will go toward paying professional
editors to polish up the graphics of our program and get it TV ready so that we
can launch it on multiple internet TV platforms (GoogleTV, Boxie, TiVo, Roku,
etc.)
If we do not reach our entire goal, we will put the money
toward the production of as many shows as possible with the amount raised.
 
The Show: The ReDonkulous
TMZ meets PTI in an
unscripted no-holds-barred sports throw down that is The ReDonkulous.
The ReDonkulous
fills the void within sports fans everywhere for information on absurd sports
events, topics, headlines and gossip that aren’t typically covered on
SportsCenter.  It is a sports show unlike
any other, that covers a week’s worth of ludicrous sports headlines and reports
them in an entertaining, witty banter in 10 minutes or less.  The hosts cap their discussion of each topic
with their patented Donk Slam, officially proclaiming said topic to be
ReDonkulous.
Hosted by the witty and charismatic Khalil Thompson and the
clever and energetic Shaka Hilton, The
ReDonkulous will have you laughing until the sun goes down … or until the
10 minutes are up, whichever comes first.


Behind the Scenes
Khalil Thompson created and produced The ReDonkulous, Knockout
and Divva On a Mission.  He is a former producer for the nationally
syndicated 2 Live Stews radio
show.  He also has multiple years of experience
in sports marketing and advertising. 
Khalil is a graduate of Xavier University.
Brandon Butler is the former Director of Digital Interactive
for Atlanta's Sports Radio 790 The Zone. 
He has multiple years of experience in web development and online sports
marketing campaigns.  Brandon is a graduate
of Georgia Southern University.
Shaka Hilton is an on-air personality for Atlanta's 680 The
Fan.  He is also the co-host of The ReDonkulous and co-producer of Knockout.  Shaka is a graduate of Savannah State
University.
Nicole Thompson is in-house legal counsel and director of The ReDonkulous.  She has 10 years of experience in sports and
entertainment law and is a graduate of Duke University.  She also graduated from Duke University
School of Law.

“Unpluggables” An Inspiring Invention That Makes Magic Happen Instead. 


    
· 
Are your kids looking at their cell phones instead of
interacting with the family?  

· 
Do you attend business events where people use their smartphone instead of engaging in the meeting? 

· 
Have you gone on a dinner date and wished your partner would “plug in”
to your conversation?
                  




The Trend of Unpluggingis Happening Everywhere.  

While working as a Life Coach, our founder Jenifer Novak Landers noticed the challenges people are having when it
comes to being present with themselves and with each other.  What started as a game with her young
daughter called “Magic Happens” turned into product idea, now merging into the worldwide
trend of unplugging from technology as a demonstration of self-care, life
balance and making time with others more productive and meaningful. 
Jenifer created thoughtfully
designed and well-constructed designer pockets to cover cell phones when people
choose to be unplugged.  The product line
also includes artful canvas signs to hang over television screens, beautifully
appointed boxes to hold multiple phones or gadgets, along with the colorful
pockets all available in a variety of sizes and designs.  “Unpluggables” are handmade from start to
finish using top grade materials.  

                  
             
The “MAGIC HAPPENS” Story. 



I always like to focus on the positive.  I wanted to teach my daughter she had a CHOICE to play/create/imagine instead of staring at a screen for too long. I wanted a positive message rather than always saying things like “TURN IT OFF” or “NO TV”. I wanted to create an opportunity with her rather than tell her what NOT todo. This is the beginning of our MAGIC HAPPENS PHILOSOPHY.  When we choose to unplug from the distraction of our screens, we are available for all the other possibilities around us.  I have speaking engagements and motivational presentations in the future for Unpluggables and the Magic Happens Lifestyle. (This is the original sign - it inspired everyone who heard about it or visited us.)

                               
I see my teenage daughter growing up
in the popularity of cell phone usage. Kids need help unplugging and want balance.  And parents need help not being distracted from their kids.

        

Gumption for Business Unplugged 
In my professional life, I'm passionate about the power of listening and being present with my clients, prospects and meetings.  I always look for ways to help people choose to UNPLUG in meetings, classrooms, events and other gatherings. Unpluggables has HUGE potential for Corporate America! Join us and help with making meetings more productive.

Just a few examples of other UNPLUGGED EVENTS:  Retirement Parties, Bar/Bat Mitzvah's, Retreats, Luncheons, Conventions, Association Meetings, Funerals, Church Groups, etc. A branded Unpluggable would make a fabulous gift for all in attendance! 
Unpluggables will be in demand long into our technology-based future.

<h2 class=""p1""><strong>The Idea </strong></h2>
<p class=""p2"">Frontrow is our innovative concept for an iPhone and iPad application — though it's really more like a canvas. One big, blank canvas made of a hundred thousand brush strokes (or content-ready squares). It's a literal world of individual pictures and posts created by the users. It's designed to flow with new trends, thoughts and concepts just like a conversation. Only in the Frontrow conversation, you're talking to the world. And entirely through your iPhone or iPad! </p>
<p class=""p2"">Our app is the perfect place to add your art, post a link to a cool event, or just meet others who share your creativity. With an in-app upload system, you can post a new photo to the Frontrow globe in only seconds. Then, take a ride on the social side with the built-in ratings system. Watch as others like, comment and change your posts in new and inventive ways. All of this—of course—for free.</p>
<p class=""p2"">By giving Frontrow a physical landscape, we want you to make a splash. We want our users to change the field, create exciting new concepts, and interact with each other in a way that goes beyond thumb-ups and virtual farming. Frontrow is about handing the real estate, and the reigns, to our users—just to see what they come up with.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Because of the social engine at the core of the Frontrow globe, the best projects are brought to the community instantly. This means you can easily stay on top of what's happening the orb over, and even add your own unique voice to the mix.</p>
<h3 class=""p2""><strong>So what would <em>you</em> do with your Frontrow space?</strong></h3>

<h2 class=""p1""><strong>The Rewards &amp; Goodies</strong></h2>
<p class=""p2"">If you decide to help us turn our Frontrow dream into a reality (and we really hope that you will) we'd like to extend a few rewards as a token of our gratitude.</p>
<p class=""p2"">For instance, any donation beginning at the <strong>$1 level</strong> will receive a personalized letter of gratitude from Frontrow app creator, James Northcott. This is just our way of saying thanks to you—as an individual—for doing what you could.</p>

<p class=""p2"">Lastly, <strong>$1000</strong> earns you our Forever Seal of gratitude, as well as 10 whole blocks within the app. That's more creative potential than one can (easily) shake a stick at—and it's all yours!</p>
<h2 class=""p2"">Expectations &amp; Experience </h2>
<p class=""p2"">Obviously, building an app like Frontrow is no small feat. However, we're not here to shortchange you: With the money raised from your backing, we plan to make an app you can use, enjoy and love on a daily basis.</p>
<p class=""p2"">To do this right, we need to raise money for the programming, designing, testing and launching of the app. The sum we need is $30,000.

<h3><strong>Who We Are</strong></h3>
<p>We have realized that people end up not using the outer casings of Mobile phones because they get tired of them sooner or later and because and/or, in most cases, they make the cell phone bigger than it is. In the end it is even difficult to pull it out of your pocket.<br/>With watch back you will have an outer casing that will protect your Mobile in case you hit it or it falls down because it covers the parts that are more easily damaged in those cases: the edges.<br/>Your Mobile phone will be always updated with a design that does not alter the image of your I Phone 5 offering you, at the same time, the innovative possibility to change it any time you want without having to pay more money to make it more attractive.</p>
<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Use of Funds</strong></h3>
<p>By funding our project we want to overcome obstacles in manufacturing, enabling WatchBack part of the daily life of all of us. Through Indegogo ask your help for the realization of our dream and also share with you all.</p>

Who We Are
We have realized that people end up not using the outer casings of Mobile phones because they get tired of them sooner or later and because and/or, in most cases, they make the cell phone bigger than it is. In the end it is even difficult to pull it out of your pocket.With watch back you will have an outer casing that will protect your Mobile in case you hit it or it falls down because it covers the parts that are more easily damaged in those cases: the edges.Your Mobile phone will be always updated with a design that does not alter the image of your I Phone 5 offering you, at the same time, the innovative possibility to change it any time you want without having to pay more money to make it more attractive.

In a move that must surely qualify him as a boyfriend-of-the-year candidate, he pays S$950 to buy an iphone 6 as a birthday gift for his girlfriend. As a factory worker making a salary of S$200 a month in vietnam, this makes his purchase <b>equivalent to 5 months of his salary</b>. So, when was the last time you spent half a year of your salary on your significant other?</p>
<p>Now most of us do some basic research online before dropping serious money on our gadgets and he must have done the same as he knew right away that S$950 was an unbelievable bargain. So the retailers make him sign some ridiculously worded invoice in english (a language he barely understands) and as he was leaving the store, they stopped him and forced him to pay an additional S$1500 for a bogus 1-year warranty before they would allow him to leave with what he believed he had purchased. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>I have contacted the Consumer Association of Singapore (CASE) and found out that Mr Pham Van Thoai has departed Singapore today (5th Nov 2014). I have been promised the contact information and address once they manage to verify his contact details as nobody wants these gifts sent to the wrong address.</p>
<p>In the event that there are errors in his contact information, we would need to seek the help of the public who may have friends or relatives living in Vietnam to help locate him.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Share this on your blog, Facebook, Twitter and tell your friends about this! </p>
<p>Show the world that even though our legal system is powerless to stop this, our community actually gives a damn and we're going to make this right!</p>

UPDATE:

Thank you for all the support and well wishes. We have raised more than the required amount. With the extra money I would like to give Mr Pham and his girlfriend an all expenses paid holiday back to Singapore to enjoy the dream holiday that was stolen from them. There is also another incident at Sim Lim Square where an international student was scammed, I would also be diverting resources to help her. 
Thank you all for your kind contributions and for making this possible!

Who am I and why am I doing this?
My name is Gabriel and I work in a small local tech startup. I am a Singaporean who is neither rich nor poor and I do not seek to profit directly or indirectly from the results of this campaign. I seek no recognition and have no political affiliations, goals nor ambitions. I also have no affiliations to the police, tourism board, CASE or any other government organization. In short, I am just an ordinary Singaporean, someone who has read the story and gives a damn, just like YOU! 


What We Need & What You Get We need to raise at least USD$1,000, but hopefully we would raise a bit more to cover express shipping and pay for a goodie bag to help alleviate their suffering. But if we do fall short, I will personally cover the rest.
This campaign will have FULL transparency including but not limited to:

Receipts and invoices Photos and videos documenting our progress
Transparent accounting for all transactions made 
In return for your kind contribution you will receive a massive Thank you email. And the knowledge that we witnessed a great injustice, banded together as a community and helped to make things right. 
All we ask from you is a small $1 contribution from the kindness of your heart to show that you care. 

   The Cost iphone 6, 128GB, Space-Grey (I'm not sure which color his girlfriend would like, Will try to ask) S$1,288.

Local Goodies from Supermarket:
Bak Kwa (Sweet Meat/Jerky) $30? Kaya Jam $20? DIY Spice Packs, (Chilli Crabs, Bak Kut Teh etc) $50?
Do Suggest more items to include (Can't be too big or heavy though) 
Fedex Priority Shipping S$83.06 (Estimated as I do not know which city yet)

https://www.fedex.com/ratefinder/standalone?method=getQuickQuote




Rough Cost Estimate S$1471.06 == USD$1176.57. 
UPDATE:
The extra funds will be used to pay for Mr Pham and his girlfriend's return to Singapore for the dream holiday that was stolen from them. Every expense will be documented and published. If you would like to sponsor their stay in Singapore at your hotel do let me know!


Risks & Challenges I have contacted the Consumer Association of Singapore (CASE) and found out that Mr Pham Van Thoai has departed Singapore today (5th Nov 2014). I have been promised the contact information and address once they manage to verify his contact details as nobody wants these gifts sent to the wrong address.
In the event that there are errors in his contact information, we would need to seek the help of the public who may have friends or relatives living in Vietnam to help locate him.

<p><strong>Not your Grandma's Table Lamp!</strong><br/><br/>Hi, I am Russie Jones co-creator of Rely-A-Light, the emergency table lamp that functions as a regular table lamp until the power goes out. When the power goes out the emergency light in the body of the lamp instantly and automatically comes on with NO HUMAN INTERACTION! My husband, a former electrical contractor and myself, an Interior Designer developed Rely-A-Light during the worst  ice storm that the south had seen in 25 years that left us without power for 8 days. Being the caregiver for my parents made my family personally aware of the problems associated with daily care of a loved one. We were most concerned with the risk of fires and falls. Rely-A-Light eliminates the need for use of candles during a power outage and can reduce the risk of falls significantly.  We realized that Rely-A-Light is a product that EVERYONE can use.<br/><br/>In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy we realized that while the need for immediate emergency light in a power outage is incredibly important, so is our need to communicate with others. In an emergency one simple phone call can put needless concerns to rest and ensure family and friends of your safety and well being. We have re-engineered the core of our product to enable you to charge your phone with, or without AC power.<br/><br/>To continue our mission in providing you with the safety and peace of mind that Rely-A-Light offers we need your help. With your pledge we will be able to manufacture our latest technology  which will provide a USB port in the base of our lamp that functions in AC and DC mode. Furthermore your help will enable us to ship at a much higher volume which will drive our price down, making Rely-A-Light affordable to everyone. We will continue to strive to make your home the safest it can be during a power outage.<br/><br/>Together we can help to reduce accidents and fatalities associated with power outages. We appreciate your help, whether you tell your friends and family about us, share our Indiegogo campaign on your Facebook and Twitter pages or pledge to our Indiegogo campaign, YOU are a valuable part of our Rely-a-Light team!

We've done our homework and are working closely with a twenty year veteran of lighting manufacturing to eliminate as many risks and potential problems as humanly possible. However, we are not without fault. We are already in production on phase one of our product and expect the next phase to run as smoothly as did phase one. In the event a problem does arise, we have a well rounded professional support team to work on all aspects of our product. We will always keep you informed, of both the good and the bad peaks and valleys along our journey together.<br/><br/><strong>FAQ</strong><br/><br/>1. What is the life of the battery?<br/><br/>Considering the average occurrence of power outages, the battery will last several years.<br/><br/>2. What if the battery needs to be replaced?<br/><br/>If the battery should fail beyond the warranty period, the lamp can be returned to our company and we will replace the battery for a nominal fee plus shipping costs. The consumer should NOT try to replace the battery. Battery replacement should only be done by qualified persons. Disassembling the lamp will void the warranty.<br/><br/>3. How long does the battery take to recharge?<br/><br/>From a full discharge or completely dead battery, which is 24 straight hours of emergency light use, it takes 48 hours to recharge the battery to full power. However, the average power outage lasts from 2 to 4 hours and the battery can be recharged in 2 hours for sufficient use.<br/><br/>4. Can I purchase different lamp shades?<br/><br/>Yes, we are continually expanding our product line to include different styles of shades and lamps to complement every décor.<br/><br/>5. Is there more than one style of lamp available?<br/><br/>Yes, our design team is working to expand our line of lamps so that we are an asset to every room in your home.<br/><br/>6. Does the top part of the lamp use a regular bulb?<br/><br/>Yes, you can use a regular incandescent bulb (the maximum wattage is in the description specific to each lamp style), a compact fluorescent bulb or a LED bulb in the top socket of the lamp.<br/><br/>7. Can I use Rely-a-light as a normal table lamp?<br/><br/>Yes, we are a normal table lamp until a power outage. Then, with no human interaction required the body of our lamp lights up and remains on until the power is restored up to 24 hours, giving you safe mobility until power is restored at which time the emergency function goes off, the battery recharges and the lamp again functions as a normal table lamp.<br/><br/>8. Can I turn the emergency light portion of my Rely-a-light off and on?<br/><br/>The lamp itself operates as any other table lamp; you may turn it off and on as often as you wish. The emergency function is designed to come on at the loss of power and remain on until power is restored up to 24 hours. Should you need or desire to turn off the emergency function (i.e. Moving the lamp from one location to another) there is a switch on the bottom of the base of the lamp for that purpose.<br/><br/>9. Is the Rely-a-light energy efficient?<br/><br/>The emergency light is energy efficient. The top portion of the lamp is energy efficient when a compact fluorescent bulb or a LED bulb is used.<br/><br/>10. What is the warranty on my Rely-a-light?<br/><br/>Your warranty card is included with your purchase of a Rely-a-light and explains in detail our warranty information.<br/><br/>11. How large a room will the lamp illuminate when in emergency mode?<br/><br/>The emergency light will light any room in an average home with enough light for safe mobility and sufficiently so that you can function in a relatively normal manner.<br/><br/>12. Is there any fire hazard from a Rely-a-light in emergency mode?<br/><br/>Rely-a-light in emergency mode is NOT a fire hazard. The US Fire and Safety Administration reports that 33% of fatal home fires are caused by candles used for light during power outages. This is one of the main reasons that we created this product. With correct use, our product is NOT a fire hazard and could prevent home accidents.<br/><br/>13. Is my Rely-a-light safe to leave on all the time?<br/><br/>Yes, the lamp itself simply functions as any other table lamp and is safe to leave on as long as you desire. However, the emergency function of the lamp is designed to be used in power outages only and it will run for 24 hours or until power is restored. The emergency mode of Rely-a-light is designed to keep the consumer from damaging the battery so it will turn itself off before damage occurs.<br/><br/>14. If I order a Rely-a-light, can I have it shipped to someone else?<br/><br/>Yes, you have the option in our order form to have separate billing and shipping addresses so that you can purchase a light as a gift and have it directly shipped to your loved one. We ship anywhere within the United States.<br/><br/>15. Will you ship outside of the United States?<br/><br/>It depends on the country that you wish to send it to. At this time the Rely-a-light operates only on 120 volts AC at 60 hertz. Many other countries operate on different voltage and hertz cycles that are not compatible with the United States system. If the country that you wish to send the lamp to is compatible with United States systems then we can ship to that country. We are expecting to offer internationally compatible products soon.<br/><br/>16. Is the emergency function of the Rely-a-light dependable?<br/><br/>Yes, we have extensively tested our product in real life situations for three years before bringing it to the public.<br/><br/>17. What is the proper care and maintenance for the lamp?<br/><br/>Treat it as any other table lamp, wipe clean with damp cloth, dust as normal, change bulb in top socket when it burns out and KEEP LAMP PLUGGED IN AT ALL TIMES so that it is ready to light your way when power is lost.<br/><br/>18. Can I unplug my Rely-a-light at night and use as a night light?<br/><br/>This is not recommended as the lamp is designed for use during power outages and use as a night light can and will reduce the life of your battery. It is important that you preserve the battery so that our lamp is there when you need it most!<br/><br/>19. Can I get replacement parts for this lamp?<br/><br/>We have shades available for order. However if the lamp needs servicing it should be returned to us. Beyond the warranty period we will repair or replace necessary parts for a fee plus shipping.<br/><br/>20. Can I ship this lamp back for repair once the warranty expires?<br/><br/>Yes, if the lamp needs servicing after the warranty expires we will repair or replace necessary parts for a fee plus shipping.<br/><br/>21. What will the turnaround time be for a lamp shipped back for repair?<br/><br/>Approximately two weeks.<br/><br/>22. Will I have online support if I have any problems with the lamp?<br/><br/>Yes, we have a troubleshooting area on our website that should answer any questions you might have. If you are unable to resolve your problem by using this resource, you may contact our technical department at keene_jones@relyalight.com.<br/><br/>23. Are there any special power requirements for the lamp?<br/><br/>No, it can be plugged into any normal 110 volt rece</p>

<ul><li>Our battery reinvents typical electrode structure from standard li-ion batteries by adding a three-dimensional anode and cathode, replacing the modern two-dimensional anode and cathode, by doing so it increases the surface area; therefore, resulting in more chemical reactions to take place in the same amount of space, theoretically causing more discharge speed and charging. <br/>

More than 4 times than the original capacity & slimmer than other extended battery.  We estimate on heavy use, this battery can handle up to 40+ hours of internet browsing, 48 hours of HD movie watching, or 84 hours of 3g talk time. This can manage around 30 hours of screen-on time in a battery endurance run.    


We estimate that this battery charges around 20-40% faster than the original factory one. Testing is still not complete, and may change after time.
A fiber optic USB 3.1 cable is also included. This USB cable will become the standard in the future.


   
  About the battery -                   
     






The Juicer uses the most innovative, groundbreaking lithium-ion battery available. 


Our battery reinvents typical electrode structure from standard li-ion batteries by adding a three-dimensional anode and cathode, replacing the modern two-dimensional anode and cathode, by doing so it increases the surface area; therefore, resulting in more chemical reactions to take place in the same amount of space, theoretically causing more discharge speed and charging. 


 Along with other groundbreaking things we can’t discuss, this would make our battery the best out there allowing it to last an estimated 25-70 percent longer than your generic smart phone battery. 


FLEXIBILITY-



Flexibility was one of our main concerns, which is why we designed multiple batterys to be able to fit into today’s most popular smart phones. 
So far we only have tested it in the Samsung Galaxy; however, we are in the process of making batteries that are able to fit in other popular smart phones on the market. So far, we have only thought about adding the phones listed below, but could consider expanding more. 


LG Phones

HTC One

Samsung Galaxys 

Sony phones  


Faster Charging -

 A new laser fiber optic USB cable is also being included.   
Fiber Optic USB 3.1 Cable Specs-     


                                                                                                                                                                                           





More Durable than standard cables. 
More Bendable than standard cables.              
Bi Direction and dual channel. 
50 percent thinner than standard cables
75 percent lighter than standard cables. 
The Type-C 3.1 connector become the new standard of usb cables which will out-date full-sized USB and micro USB.
 7.9 GBPS download Speeds. USB 2.0 supports 480 mbs/sec
Current range 2A-5A. Voltage range 5- 15V. Devices which consume alot of energy will be able to receive more power.

------
With breaking new technologically, we are developing new and very fast chargers but we are facing major challenges on how to shrink it to fit in other smartphones. It is only a matter of time before we relase updated chargers!


This cable, which is still being developed, is the future of USB.

Charging in the sunlight!










Since we know how inconvenient it can be to have your phone die. A new solar panel case was designed to not only keep your phone secured, but to charge your phone from any light source. We separate ourselves from the competitors by using an aluminum frame instead of a cheap plastic frame.  Our solar panels have technology found in larger solar panels, but to a nano-scaled degree, which gives us an unlimited range of motion to charge your phone, compared to other solar panels cases that must be at a 90 degree angle to the sun.
 The best aspect of this technology is its spectrum range of light; enabling it to be charged in the shade. Testing is still being done to a larger scale; however, we estimate that it takes an hour to charge completely in the light, and it takes two hours when cloudy.  

     The battery comes with a solar panel charging case available in different            colors and styles to appeal to the consumer.

<p></p>
<p>Cellular providers are continually telling us that they have the best plans for us. The plans are new and improved to give us just what we need… at an excessive cost. The latest smartphone has the most “amazing” new features… but they aren’t innovative at all. NEBI.MOBI is the most cost-effective, innovative service and smartphone to ever hit the market. Cell phone providers think they have a lock on the services, but NEBI.MOBI, with your help, is going to show them how it’s really done.</p>

<p><b>What Cellular Telephone Services Don’t Tell You—AKA The Deception</b></p>
<p>Telephone data is transformed from analog to digital content. All cell phone plans indicate a separation between talking minutes, number of text messages, and amount of data use. These are actually all the same service, provided the same way. By separating them and limiting amounts of each one for different packages, they deceive consumers into believing that different rates should apply to talk, text, and data. Why are we paying three different rates with different limitations for the same thing? All of these services are digitally provided. They should all be unlimited at one low price. This is a sales gimmick and it locks customers into two year contracts and fees for overages that are outrageous. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>No More Hype, Just Honesty and Innovation</b></p>
<p>We need to move away from the hype and misleading information of cellular providers and their famous two year contracts and three prices for the same service. Instead of depending on cellular network signals, at NEBI.MOBI we are using Wi-Fi based network signals and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technologies to deliver superior service without the inflated price tag. These technologies are capable of supporting talk, text, and data – which is really all just data. This will bring smartphones to an entirely new level of capability and accessibility. That’s right, innovation in the mobile industry. This is a rare gem.</p>

<h3><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;""><p><b>Can I use VOIP?</b></p>
<p>VOIP technology has become increasingly efficient. Our codecs secure encrypted connections and maintain lightning-fast data transfer speed. Smartphone designs, whether you consider ours or your current phone, have advanced to the point of being able to support VOIP apps reliably.</p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Is Wi-Fi Up to the Challenge?</b></p></span></h3>
<div><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;""><p>Wi-Fi is not controlled by government agencies and does not incur huge government-related fees and taxes. Wi-Fi signals have increased in capability and availability to a point that makes it faster and easier to access from a growing number of sources every day. We believe that free public Wi-Fi access should be available in every city. Free public access should be provided by each city’s leaders as a show of understanding of the importance of communication and connection in today’s world. One of our goals with funding of NEBI.MOBI is to increase advocacy nationwide for free public Wi-Fi in entire cities. Until we fully succeed, you can supplement your Wi-Fi access points through data-only cellular plans for achieving a wider coverage area, and still enjoy substantial savings compared to your traditional smartphone bills. You deserve to be able to connect wherever you are, without having to search for a free hotspot or pay a cellular service for data usage.</p></span></div>

<p><b>CHOICE: When is the Last Time You Were REALLY Given a Choice?</b></p>
<p>NEBI.MOBI services allow you to use EVE 008 or your own smartphone. You get to choose. This is real choice. No contracts attached. We refuse to impose limits like cell providers.</p>
<p><b>The Science and More</b></p>
<p>Cellular networks, Wi-Fi, VoIP, expanding network infrastructures, GSM, codecs, telecom providers… It can be overwhelming. We have done the research, studied the options, explored the field, experimented, and applied the science. We have designed and manufactured a value-oriented smartphone capable of operating via Wi-Fi or current mobile carriers. Our Android OS has been boosted for higher power efficiency. We have submitted for trademarks, secured FCC license approvals, negotiated service contracts, and coded and test our apps and service architecture. </p>
<p>As we begin, we will need a lot of subscribers with current Wi-Fi optimized VOIP devices to help us drive down the wholesale minutes pricing from telecom servers. We want to make sure that we can support the greatest number of customers with optimal bandwidth for a positive user experience. </p>
<p>Another use of funds will be the deployment of free public Wi-Fi coverage. We want to expand the availability to more places so that everyone, whether they use our service or not, has access to free public Wi-Fi. </p>
<p><b>Reasons You May Not Have Considered that Might Make You Go Hmmm….</b></p>
<p>This device and network has more value than you may think. With our system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Teens cannot text and drive as they move through active Wi-Fi zones</li>
<li>You can travel worldwide and avoid roaming charges once our Wi-Fi based phone service is live</li>
<li>You can resell your old expensive cell phone at near retail and use one that’s even better - Pocket the extra savings from the resale</li>
<li>The two SIM card strategy allows you to carry one phone for two lines</li>
<li>No contracts</li>
<li>No dragging around a separate charger with our quick-swap battery</li>
<li>You can let your young child play games on EVE 008, which you surely shouldn’t do with a $600-$800 smartphone</li>
<li>SD card slot for expansion and easy transfer of data – no technical assistance or fancy programs needed</li>
<li>Tons of Android Apps available for use with EVE 008</li>
<li>Skype and Wi-Fi chat applications allow communications with family and friends around the world</li>
<li>EVE 008 can serve as a low cost temporary or permanent replacement phone if your current smartphone is stolen or broken </li>
<li>NEBI.MOBI can easily replace home phone service as a much lower cost option</li>
<li>Regardless from reaching to our funding goal, anyone who donates $175 will receive EVE 008 with our thanks - No tax, no shipping, no handling charges! What a great value!</li>
<li>As soon as we have the funding and are ready to activate NEBI.MOBI service, our backers will pay only $60/YEAR for the unlimited mobile phone service</li>
<li>EVE 008 is totally hot—have you seen her pics?</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Innovation and the New Era of Smartphones Needs You</b></p>
<p>My wife and I believe in innovation. We believe in this project. We have invested time and money into establishing as much as we can and now we need help to get this project off the ground and let it fly. Your donation will be a part of a new era of smartphone services. The funds raised will be used to launch the platform, acquire users, and drive down the price of our devices and services. Higher volume equals lower costs to consumers. We need to pay for high-end telecom servers to ensure proper levels of bandwidth for the best experience for our customers. Funds will also help us deploy our plans for increased free Wi-Fi coverage. </p>
<p><b>This is a</b><b> REVOLUTION</b></p>
<p>Be a REBEL—<b>R</b>evolutionary <b>E</b>volution <b>B</b>acker for <b>E</b>scape from <b>L</b>imitations. Escape from the constraints of the same old mobile delivery systems that have been around forever. They keep charging more because they think we are trapped. It’s time to show them that the Innovation Revolution has started and you are a part of it. How many times does an opportunity like this present itself? In this industry, not very often. In fact, almost never. Be a REBEL and join the revolution. It’s like the Boston Tea Party for the 21st century.</p>
<p><b>Can I Really Make a Difference and What’s in it for Me Besides Awesome REBEL status?</b></p>
<p>To be a part of NEBI.MOBI, you can do two things. First, you can spread the word. Tell people about us. Tell them what we are doing. Show them the EVE 008 specs and cool features. See how your friends and connections feel about freedom from cellular carriers and expensive plans and devices. Link to our campaign. Use your social media to help us educate people about our project. Tell them to be a REBEL! Encourage people to unchain themselves from the cellular carriers who hold them captive! They take your business for granted believing you have no alternative. BUT YOU DO. We need you to help us get this message out! Help the Revolution grow. Add to our REBELs!</p>
<p>Second, you can make a monetary contribution to help us finish up funding the project. We’ve done a lot on our own, but we still need some help. As for you, there are some really awesome perks and rewards for making donations. T-shirts, parties, free smartphones, starring in our advertising, and naming our next mobile device model are up for grabs along with other thank you gifts. In fact, the first 50 backers at the $149 level will receive an EVE 008 with our thanks! The best reward will be your freedom from cellular providers. Let’s face it, we’re all sick of their manipulations. </p>
<p>If we cannot reach our goal on Indiegogo, it will be impossible for us to secure competitive pricing from potential vendors in a timely manner. If we can reach our goal, we will be able to pass along cost savings to our customers. We want to provide you with unlimited mobile service for $60 per year or less, and an affordable, efficient, optimized mobile device for the lowest possible cost to you without requiring any contracts.</p>
<p>This is the first REAL innovation in the mobile industry and you can be a part of it. Claim your status as a founder of the new wave. How cool is that?</p>
<p>Achievement of our goal will allow us to move to our Stretch Goals, including specialized EVE 008 cases and extra batteries. </p>

</div></div>","Cellular Providers are Being Put on Notice

Cellular providers are continually telling us that they have the best plans for us. The plans are new and improved to give us just what we need… at an excessive cost. The latest smartphone has the most “amazing” new features… but they aren’t innovative at all. NEBI.MOBI is the most cost-effective, innovative service and smartphone to ever hit the market. Cell phone providers think they have a lock on the services, but NEBI.MOBI, with your help, is going to show them how it’s really done.
As Seen On



     


     

     

What Cellular Telephone Services Don’t Tell You—AKA The Deception
Telephone data is transformed from analog to digital content. All cell phone plans indicate a separation between talking minutes, number of text messages, and amount of data use. These are actually all the same service, provided the same way. By separating them and limiting amounts of each one for different packages, they deceive consumers into believing that different rates should apply to talk, text, and data. Why are we paying three different rates with different limitations for the same thing? All of these services are digitally provided. They should all be unlimited at one low price. This is a sales gimmick and it locks customers into two year contracts and fees for overages that are outrageous. 

No More Hype, Just Honesty and Innovation
We need to move away from the hype and misleading information of cellular providers and their famous two year contracts and three prices for the same service. Instead of depending on cellular network signals, at NEBI.MOBI we are using Wi-Fi based network signals and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technologies to deliver superior service without the inflated price tag. These technologies are capable of supporting talk, text, and data – which is really all just data. This will bring smartphones to an entirely new level of capability and accessibility. That’s right, innovation in the mobile industry. This is a rare gem.



Can I use VOIP?
VOIP technology has become increasingly efficient. Our codecs secure encrypted connections and maintain lightning-fast data transfer speed. Smartphone designs, whether you consider ours or your current phone, have advanced to the point of being able to support VOIP apps reliably.
Is Wi-Fi Up to the Challenge?
Wi-Fi is not controlled by government agencies and does not incur huge government-related fees and taxes. Wi-Fi signals have increased in capability and availability to a point that makes it faster and easier to access from a growing number of sources every day. We believe that free public Wi-Fi access should be available in every city. Free public access should be provided by each city’s leaders as a show of understanding of the importance of communication and connection in today’s world. One of our goals with funding of NEBI.MOBI is to increase advocacy nationwide for free public Wi-Fi in entire cities. Until we fully succeed, you can supplement your Wi-Fi access points through data-only cellular plans for achieving a wider coverage area, and still enjoy substantial savings compared to your traditional smartphone bills. You deserve to be able to connect wherever you are, without having to search for a free hotspot or pay a cellular service for data usage.



Meet EVE 008—She’s Gorgeous and Highly Capable

EVE 008 is our remarkable touchscreen smartphone. It actually has a replaceable battery that will eliminate the need for bulky charging cases or a tangle of charging cords and panicked searches for places to charge your phone. Two phone lines can be combined on one device by using two SIM card services simultaneously, eliminating the need for a work and home cell phone, lightening the load in your purse or pocket. An SD slot allows for expansion and transfer of data without dealing with additional technology or apps. Data is saved even if the phone is injured. And EVE 008 doesn’t carry the price tag of smartphones with even half of her capability. That doesn’t even begin to describe what EVE 008 can do for you.
EVE 008’s specs:

Dual SIM Card (1 Standard, 1 Micro) 
Android 4.2.2 
Quad-core 1.3 GHz Processor 
RAM 1GB 
Internal Storage 4GB 
SD Card slot for 32GB storage expansion 
FM Radio 
A-GPS 
Bluetooth 4.0 
Wi-Fi and mobile AP 
IPS bright screen, 4.5 inch multi-touch 
Ultra-slim body, 0.346 inch thin 
Lithium swappable battery, 2000 mAh 
Software supported 8MP camera with LED flash light 
Software supported 2MP front facing camera 
Quad-band GSM (850/900/1800/1900 Mhz) for World-Wide compatibility 
4G network data speeds (i.e. T-Mobile, AT&T, Metro PCS and more for US)
Special fast charger, USB cable, and noise canceling headphones are included






CHOICE: When is the Last Time You Were REALLY Given a Choice?
NEBI.MOBI services allow you to use EVE 008 or your own smartphone. You get to choose. This is real choice. No contracts attached. We refuse to impose limits like cell providers.
The Science and More
Cellular networks, Wi-Fi, VoIP, expanding network infrastructures, GSM, codecs, telecom providers… It can be overwhelming. We have done the research, studied the options, explored the field, experimented, and applied the science. We have designed and manufactured a value-oriented smartphone capable of operating via Wi-Fi or current mobile carriers. Our Android OS has been boosted for higher power efficiency. We have submitted for trademarks, secured FCC license approvals, negotiated service contracts, and coded and test our apps and service architecture. 
As we begin, we will need a lot of subscribers with current Wi-Fi optimized VOIP devices to help us drive down the wholesale minutes pricing from telecom servers. We want to make sure that we can support the greatest number of customers with optimal bandwidth for a positive user experience. 
Another use of funds will be the deployment of free public Wi-Fi coverage. We want to expand the availability to more places so that everyone, whether they use our service or not, has access to free public Wi-Fi. 
Reasons You May Not Have Considered that Might Make You Go Hmmm….
This device and network has more value than you may think. With our system:

Teens cannot text and drive as they move through active Wi-Fi zones
You can travel worldwide and avoid roaming charges once our Wi-Fi based phone service is live
You can resell your old expensive cell phone at near retail and use one that’s even better - Pocket the extra savings from the resale
The two SIM card strategy allows you to carry one phone for two lines
No contracts
No dragging around a separate charger with our quick-swap battery
You can let your young child play games on EVE 008, which you surely shouldn’t do with a $600-$800 smartphone
SD card slot for expansion and easy transfer of data – no technical assistance or fancy programs needed
Tons of Android Apps available for use with EVE 008
Skype and Wi-Fi chat applications allow communications with family and friends around the world
EVE 008 can serve as a low cost temporary or permanent replacement phone if your current smartphone is stolen or broken 
NEBI.MOBI can easily replace home phone service as a much lower cost option
Regardless from reaching to our funding goal, anyone who donates $175 will receive EVE 008 with our thanks - No tax, no shipping, no handling charges! What a great value!
As soon as we have the funding and are ready to activate NEBI.MOBI service, our backers will pay only $60/YEAR for the unlimited mobile phone service
EVE 008 is totally hot—have you seen her pics?

Innovation and the New Era of Smartphones Needs You
My wife and I believe in innovation. We believe in this project. We have invested time and money into establishing as much as we can and now we need help to get this project off the ground and let it fly. Your donation will be a part of a new era of smartphone services. The funds raised will be used to launch the platform, acquire users, and drive down the price of our devices and services. Higher volume equals lower costs to consumers. We need to pay for high-end telecom servers to ensure proper levels of bandwidth for the best experience for our customers. Funds will also help us deploy our plans for increased free Wi-Fi coverage. 
This is a REVOLUTION
Be a REBEL—Revolutionary Evolution Backer for Escape from Limitations. Escape from the constraints of the same old mobile delivery systems that have been around forever. They keep charging more because they think we are trapped. It’s time to show them that the Innovation Revolution has started and you are a part of it. How many times does an opportunity like this present itself? In this industry, not very often. In fact, almost never. Be a REBEL and join the revolution. It’s like the Boston Tea Party for the 21st century.
Can I Really Make a Difference and What’s in it for Me Besides Awesome REBEL status?
To be a part of NEBI.MOBI, you can do two things. First, you can spread the word. Tell people about us. Tell them what we are doing. Show them the EVE 008 specs and cool features. See how your friends and connections feel about freedom from cellular carriers and expensive plans and devices. Link to our campaign. Use your social media to help us educate people about our project. Tell them to be a REBEL! Encourage people to unchain themselves from the cellular carriers who hold them captive! They take your business for granted believing you have no alternative. BUT YOU DO. We need you to help us get this message out! Help the Revolution grow. Add to our REBELs!
Second, you can make a monetary contribution to help us finish up funding the project. We’ve done a lot on our own, but we still need some help. As for you, there are some really awesome perks and rewards for making donations. T-shirts, parties, free smartphones, starring in our advertising, and naming our next mobile device model are up for grabs along with other thank you gifts. In fact, the first 50 backers at the $149 level will receive an EVE 008 with our thanks! The best reward will be your freedom from cellular providers. Let’s face it, we’re all sick of their manipulations. 
If we cannot reach our goal on Indiegogo, it will be impossible for us to secure competitive pricing from potential vendors in a timely manner. If we can reach our goal, we will be able to pass along cost savings to our customers. We want to provide you with unlimited mobile service for $60 per year or less, and an affordable, efficient, optimized mobile device for the lowest possible cost to you without requiring any contracts.
This is the first REAL innovation in the mobile industry and you can be a part of it. Claim your status as a founder of the new wave. How cool is that?
Achievement of our goal will allow us to move to our Stretch Goals, including specialized EVE 008 cases and extra batteries. 

Yes, this is an ambitious target for us, but it is very possible to hit with your support. Reaching these levels of a volume reduces our manufacturing cost per device, and we would like pass such savings to you by including a beautiful, custom fit, see-through case for protecting your smartphone… 



Successfully funding this much means that we now reached to a production volume that makes economically feasible to manufacture our smartphones in additional colors without an extra cost to our backers. Now, you can select what color you would like for yourself…



Wow, this is like a dream number for us. This amount of a funding will also allow us to take advantage of some serious economies of scale. We will be able to send you an extra battery with each EVE 008 device, too… Thank you a million times… 





     











If I Buy an EVE 008, What’s Next?
EVE 008 has already met all of the regulatory approvals necessary for entering the manufacturing process. When our funding rises, we will reach a point of better economic feasibility for manufacturing volumes. At that point, we can focus our energy on pairing this amazing value device with its complementing mobile phone service. 
EVE 008 will arrive ready-to-use with any GSM mobile carrier service. We are continuing to work on NEBI.MOBI mobile phone service as the funding increases. When our backers support us in a way that allows a reasonable cost decrease for the provision of the service, it will be activated. At that time, we will alert you that the system is ready to add your $60 per year unlimited mobile service plan.

<b>Smartstones are designed for accessibility. We have worked with the blind, autistic, elderly, parents, spouses, academic researchers, PhD's and scientists.</b>
</div>
<div>
<b></b><p><b>We take communication for granted, until it is taken away. </b></p>
<p>Smartstones Touch has no screen, uses flexible multi-sensory outputs, and has an intuitive interface that is adaptable and easy to learn. <b>With your help, lets put a Smartstones Touch in the hands of more than one million families next year, and help them find their words, connect and thrive.</b></p>
<p>When <b>one out of 68 children</b> are born with some form of autism, <b>285 million people</b> are visually impaired, and <b>360 million people</b> have disabling hearing loss, accessibility becomes imperative in truly break-through technology. These massive communities of people with communication challenges are underserved by mainstream technology, and specialized technology often costs ridiculous and arbitrary sums.</p>
<p>Tri-Counties Regional Center supports over 12,000 individuals with developmental disabilities including <b>Autism</b>, <b>Epilepsy</b>, <b>Cerebral Palsy</b> and <b>Intellectual Challenges</b>. There are 21 regional centers supporting over 300,000 Californians with disabilities to live life with more vitality and connectedness to our community.</p>
<p><b>Support Smartstones by funding our campaign today. We will help them by making Smartstones and our services available to their entire community.</b></p>

<p><b>Q. How do I use Smartstones Touch?<br/></b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A. Once you’ve opened the app and configured your stones, you simply select a gesture and assign a ""message"" to it. </span></p>
<p><b>Q.<span>  </span>How do I read a message coming to me on a Touch?<br/></b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A.</span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">  You can choose to receive your messages as in app push notifications, text messages, or if you have your own Smartstones Touch (e.g. 2pack), </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">the message will present as a combination of
vibration, colored lights, and sound. You can identify different
messages through the tone or pattern of the vibration, color or pattern of the
LED lights, or presence of sound. For example, an “urgent”message triggers bright flashing red
lights, a powerful, constant vibration, and a loud sound. In contrast, “I’m okay” triggers a soft pulsating green
light, and two short bursts of vibration. Think about these as easily recognizable patterns.</span></p>

Preorder your Smartstones at http://smartstones.co/shop


Smartstones® Touch™ is a nonverbal communication device, a palm-sized stone controlled through simple touch and motion gestures. You can send messages, reminders, and location based alerts to people in your private network using our :connect app. Our gesture to speech app, :prose, lets you speak phrases aloud through simple swipes, taps, and shakes.



A truly enchanting experience, the physical Smartstones serve as a human interface device,  actuating messages from existing and future smartphone and tablet apps as unique vibration+light+sound patterns. You can configure your gestures and messages using our app - and can send them, from either the stone or the app, to your family or friends, or anyone who you need to communicate with. You can also direct your messages to others via SMS, push notifications, or pre-recorded voice messages, using the free :connect and :prose apps.

Smartstones are designed for accessibility. We have worked with the blind, autistic, elderly, parents, spouses, academic researchers, PhD's and scientists.


We take communication for granted, until it is taken away. 
Smartstones Touch has no screen, uses flexible multi-sensory outputs, and has an intuitive interface that is adaptable and easy to learn. With your help, lets put a Smartstones Touch in the hands of more than one million families next year, and help them find their words, connect and thrive.
When one out of 68 children are born with some form of autism, 285 million people are visually impaired, and 360 million people have disabling hearing loss, accessibility becomes imperative in truly break-through technology. These massive communities of people with communication challenges are underserved by mainstream technology, and specialized technology often costs ridiculous and arbitrary sums.
Tri-Counties Regional Center supports over 12,000 individuals with developmental disabilities including Autism, Epilepsy, Cerebral Palsy and Intellectual Challenges. There are 21 regional centers supporting over 300,000 Californians with disabilities to live life with more vitality and connectedness to our community.
Support Smartstones by funding our campaign today. We will help them by making Smartstones and our services available to their entire community.

Smartstones :prose app*: ""Find your voice"" - Express yourself with simple swipes, taps, shapes and motion gestures. It speaks almost 40 languages. Great for anyone – kids, friends, adults, seniors. Immediately available to backers after this campaign ends as a standalone iOS app, that will also work with Smartstones Touch when we ship. *Patent pending
Projected Capacitive Touch*: Using Projected Capacitive Touch (PCT), the same technology used in smartphone touch screens, the top surface of Smartstones Touch can detect touches such as swipes, taps, and holds before your hand touches the stone, and it will even work through clothing. *Patent pending




Accelerometer & Gyroscope: The Touch includes a 6-axis accelerometer and gyroscope to sense motion. Currently, we’re working on developing complex gesture recognition software, so we can begin compiling a library of gestures to use with Smartstones Touch.




Wireless Inductive Charging: Smartstones Touch is a rechargeable, completely sealed unit that uses Qi-compliant inductive charging circuitry, so you never have to plug it in. Simply lay the stone to sleep in its cradle and it immediately begins charging and lets you know when its refreshed. 




Bluetooth 4.0 (BLE):  The IndieGoGo Edition of Smartstones Touch, in ""Chalk"" white, uses Bluetooth 4.0 and works with any internet-connected Bluetooth 4.0 compatible device. We are currently developing apps on a number of platforms, including smartphones (iOS and Android), tablets and laptops.




Open API: We will open the Smartstones platform for developers to create apps for a variety of uses. Smartstones Touch can be easily integrated with other internet-connected devices and services, including SMS and voice delivery.








Gestures for sending messages*: We’ve decided to start simple with a handful of easy to remember and easy to use touch and motion gestures. Smartstones will continue to provide free updates as we expand our library of touch and motion gestures. *Patent pending





Hapticon™ Patterns*: Working in cooperation with world renowned researchers, usability experts, academics and visually impaired users, we have arrived at a standard set of Hapticon patterns, composed of vibration, light, and sound. Feel free to use the default combinations or configure your own. *Patent pending




Group Push Reminders and Alerts*: Instantly create and push reminder alerts to one or more stones in your network. Perfect for reminding grandpa to take his heart medication, or coordinating activities for the kids. We recommend co-creating reminders with the people who will receive them, so they can help decide what color and vibration pattern to use, making them more memorable. *Patent pending




Cloud Messaging Platform*: Our sophisticated cloud messaging infrastructure supports messaging, network configuration, and data storage with scalability, advanced security and high reliability. *Patent pending

Material: We are developing a custom case material that feels like natural stone. Our Materials engineer worked at Apple for 11 years and was responsible for many of their patented material innovations.
Shape: Smartstones Touch was designed to fit comfortably in your hand, like a smooth river stone, with every dimension unique so you can use it with your eyes closed.
Size & Weight:  10mm x 40mm x 60mm or ½” x 1 ¾” x 2 ½”; fits comfortably into the small coin pocket of your favorite jeans. Only 10 grams.




Waterproof:  Completely sealed unit.

Smartstones was previewed on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.
""Smartstones are awe inducing. A lovely way of humanizing technology. I love it.""     - Jon Stewart, Host of The Daily Show


""Smartstones is the quintessential example of “high tech meets high touch.”     - Katy Fike, PhD Gerontologist; Co-Founder, Aging2.0; Generator Ventures
""As a mom and a family caregiver, I can’t wait for this one to go to market.*""      - Amie Clark, Co-founder of The Senior List and The Senior Resource Network.
“This is groundbreaking.""      - Lori La Bey, #1 Alzheimer’s influencer, host of Alzheimer’s Speaks
“Smartstones Touch is an uncomplicated approach to letting loved ones reach out to each other.”      - John Wider, Board of Directors, AARP Andrus Insurance Fund










Q. How do I use Smartstones Touch?A. Once you’ve opened the app and configured your stones, you simply select a gesture and assign a ""message"" to it. 
Q.  How do I read a message coming to me on a Touch?A.  You can choose to receive your messages as in app push notifications, text messages, or if you have your own Smartstones Touch (e.g. 2pack), the message will present as a combination of
vibration, colored lights, and sound. You can identify different
messages through the tone or pattern of the vibration, color or pattern of the
LED lights, or presence of sound. For example, an “urgent”message triggers bright flashing red
lights, a powerful, constant vibration, and a loud sound. In contrast, “I’m okay” triggers a soft pulsating green
light, and two short bursts of vibration. Think about these as easily recognizable patterns.
Q.  How does Smartstones
Touch connect to the internet?A.  The first edition of Smartstones Touch uses a
Bluetooth Low Energy connection, depending on a paired smartphone or tablet with .
Q.  How do I charge the
Touch?A.  Simply place Smartstones Touch
in its charging case, and it will charge automatically via a wireless inductive Qi charger.
Q.  How many messages can I send?A.  The number of possibilities for light and
vibration patterns is enormous, with thousands of possible messages you can
send. To start, you’ll get 12 preset messages that you can configure, quickly unlocking more messages and
creating your own custom combinations.

<h1>The Story</h1>
<p>Imagine if all phone and tablets we use every day—were protected from the growth of bacteria, fungus, mold and other microbes that can build up and cause unclean surfaces and limit the functional life of your screen protector. Now imagine cleaner, stronger and longer lasting screen protection. That, in a nutshell, is the idea behind CleanShield!</p>
<p>Perfect Fit Technologies is a 2011 start-up company focused on creative solutions for <a href=""http://www.perfectfittech.com/blogs/news/7215266-apple-ipad-2nd-3rd-4th-gen-screen-shield-screen-protector-install-perfect-fit-technologies-review"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">common tech problems</a>. We've spent the last two years dreaming, testing and working with scientists and engineers to develop a<strong><strong><strong> proprietary USA based coating infused with EPA registered Antimicrobial Ionic-Silver Technology.</strong></strong></strong> CleanShield provides a cleaner surface while protecting your device from scratches and unwanted mishaps.</p>
<p>We want indiegogo to be the place that CleanShield launches from; giving indiegogoers a chance to be apart of launching this revolutionary product into a reality!</p>
<p><strong>The first 25 people to back our project (Perk 2) will receive an Early Bird Special CleanShield Screen Protector of your choice for only $7! </strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/97893/files/20130926115548-IMG_6187.JPG?1380221748"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<h1>The Features</h1>
<ul>
<li>EPA Registered Ionic-Silver Antimicrobial</li>
<li><strong>Made in the USA</strong></li>
<li>High Optical Clarity</li>
<li>Fingerprint Resistant</li>
<li>Scratch Protection</li>
<li>High Touch Sensitivity</li>
<li>Smooth Application</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Full silicone adhesive coating that won't leave any sticky residue when removed. </span></li>
</ul>
<h1>The Quality</h1>
<p>The precision pre-cut CleanShield applies directly to your device, providing the best clarity and scratch protection you will find. CleanShield is cut specifically to cover maximum amount of the device surface to keep it free from bacteria.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0246/1007/files/3a927c5f73d6c0be68b7683d9bdb6ddb_large.JPG?665"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<h1>The Reason</h1>
<p><strong>Your cell phone contains over 25,000 Bacteria per square inch! </strong>Studies have shown that the average smart phone is a breeding ground for bacteria, fungus, mold and other damaging microbes. In fact, the average cell phone is up to 16 times dirtier than a public toilet seat. The use of disinfectant wipes and sprays can actually damage the surface of your touch screen device and must be constantly reapplied to even be effective.</p>
<h1>How it works</h1>
<p>CleanShield is a high optical clarity made in the USA screen protector infused with an <strong>EPA registered antimicrobial ionic-silver technology</strong> that provides continuous 24/7 protection against the growth of bacteria, fungus, mold and other damaging microbes. </p>

The Story
Imagine if all phone and tablets we use every day—were protected from the growth of bacteria, fungus, mold and other microbes that can build up and cause unclean surfaces and limit the functional life of your screen protector. Now imagine cleaner, stronger and longer lasting screen protection. That, in a nutshell, is the idea behind CleanShield!
Perfect Fit Technologies is a 2011 start-up company focused on creative solutions for common tech problems. We've spent the last two years dreaming, testing and working with scientists and engineers to develop a proprietary USA based coating infused with EPA registered Antimicrobial Ionic-Silver Technology. CleanShield provides a cleaner surface while protecting your device from scratches and unwanted mishaps.
We want indiegogo to be the place that CleanShield launches from; giving indiegogoers a chance to be apart of launching this revolutionary product into a reality!
The first 25 people to back our project (Perk 2) will receive an Early Bird Special CleanShield Screen Protector of your choice for only $7! 



The Features

EPA Registered Ionic-Silver Antimicrobial
Made in the USA
High Optical Clarity
Fingerprint Resistant
Scratch Protection
High Touch Sensitivity
Smooth Application
Full silicone adhesive coating that won't leave any sticky residue when removed. 

The Quality
The precision pre-cut CleanShield applies directly to your device, providing the best clarity and scratch protection you will find. CleanShield is cut specifically to cover maximum amount of the device surface to keep it free from bacteria.






The Reason
Your cell phone contains over 25,000 Bacteria per square inch! Studies have shown that the average smart phone is a breeding ground for bacteria, fungus, mold and other damaging microbes. In fact, the average cell phone is up to 16 times dirtier than a public toilet seat. The use of disinfectant wipes and sprays can actually damage the surface of your touch screen device and must be constantly reapplied to even be effective.
How it works
CleanShield is a high optical clarity made in the USA screen protector infused with an EPA registered antimicrobial ionic-silver technology that provides continuous 24/7 protection against the growth of bacteria, fungus, mold and other damaging microbes. 

Silver-silver ions are small enough to be transparent. They are also mobile enough to flood the surface of the film. Air moisture activates the release of silver ions from their cage, which, in turn deters bacterial growth on the surface of the film.

<p>If you don't want
somebody to have your some of your info. Simply Withdraw the access
it will delete itself out in his account.</p>

updates his own info if needed. It autocratically synchronizes with
your address book. Nothing to do for you.
If you don't want
somebody to have your some of your info. Simply Withdraw the access
it will delete itself out in his account.






Picture service:



You simply convert your picture to our new "".addnat"" format. Then post it on you webpage.You can remove it afterwards or set a time limit for a period in wich the picture should be visible. 
After removing the visibility, or after the time you set expires the picture will automatically be replaced by a small placeholder. Everywhere. Even on other pages that copied your picture to their page.




Everything else:
The concept mentioned above applies to everything.
AddNat is simple because it is always the same:You don't want
somebody to acces your data or use your device? withdraw the
access.Everyone just updates his own data, all their contacts
will be updated automatically.



How
can I
start now?

Simply
download the Android-App or visit  www.addnat.com
to use our webservice. Register for free
and start getting your data back under your
control.

Or get the Android App on Google Play:  



Why AddNat?
AddNat is simple to use because it is always the same. Allow acces to data or Withdraw it.Why go complicated when it could be easy while still being secure?




Do we sell your data?
No!We are located in Germany and use German
servers, to ensure the highest level of security. The data is
protected so well that even we are not able to see it, or make your
pictures visible again. Even if we wanted to.We can promise you
that we won't use your data or sell it out, not to other companies
nor to spies. ;)We have to keep this promise as we can't even
access your data.



Why do we need
funding?
We want to expand. We want to make many more things
possible to protect your data and make your life easier. Every
Day.
We want to secure Cars, TVs and many more things. Thievery
will be gone.We want to make the user interface more friendly, to
make it possible to get the most and best security for everyone even
for less techier persons.We need the money to create an app for
Apple devices, for our redesign, and to get company owners to include
AddNat security into their products like cars, and TVs.Also if the money allows it we would like to work on more translations and improve the existing one.

Risks and challenges


The
challenge
The challenge is to include create an interface
that always is the same, on every platform. So that everyone is
familiar with it. And that everyone knows how to use
it.

Risks
There are basically none.If we
archive our goal or not you will get your perk, as our platform is
already done for the most.Whatever amount of money we make we
will create this things. It will take us much more time however. Time
in which your data will be unsecured....
   Other ways to help 
Spread the
word!Tell other people about this campaign and how awesome it can
be.Share the link on your favorite social media or by whatever
you like.

<p><strong>Make Them Work For You Ltd.</strong> is head-quartered in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada and we are an Alberta Registered (Incorporation Number 5116595546) <strong>Non Profit</strong> organization with a very ambitious project to aggregate various information services into a convenient and easy to use Web 2.0 platform. Our stated objectives are <em>""To promote openess and transparency in all levels of government. To provide citizens easy access to government information that would be beneficial to their lives and/or their voting decisions. To enable citizens to easily interact with their representatives and the government as a whole."" </em></p>
<h2>To learn more visit our website: <a href=""http://makethemworkforyou.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://makethemworkforyou.com</a>
</h2>
<p>We have spent the last 10 months developing the <strong>largest single database</strong> of information on Canadian politicians (over 600 and growing!) we aggregate information such as voting records, campaign finances and expenses as well as recent news and social media updates. We decided to take a ""bottom-up"" approach and focus on levels of government that most political apps/websites ignore so we started with some of the largest Canadian cities and provinces.</p>
<p><strong>We currently track politicians from the following areas:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Federal:</strong> 120 of 308 politician (to be completed July 31, 2012)<br/><strong>Provincial:</strong> Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Northwest Terriories, Nunavut, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan, Yukon<br/><strong>Municipal:</strong> Calgary, Edmonton, Hamilton, Ottawa, Toronto, Vancouver, Winnipeg</p>
<h2> </h2>
<p><strong>And now we want to take our project to the next level!</strong></p>
<h1>What Are We Building?</h1>
<div class=""template""><img alt=""Wire Frame"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/261519/pictures/full/20120607122922-WireFrame.jpg?1339097385"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>We feel that people should have easy access to their politicians and to their government. We have features in mind that would combine the best of many political apps in the marketplace and leverage our extensive knowledge on Canadian politicians to provide interaction and features not seen in other apps. We will be offering both a paid ($0.99) and an ad-supported free version of the app.</p>
<h2><strong>Our app will be able to:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>look up representatives at all 3 levels of government based on postal code or current GPS or aGPS location </li>
<li>contact their representative through email, twitter, facebook, linkedin, or telephone</li>
<li>use our pre-formatted templates when contacting their representative</li>

Make Them Work For You Ltd. is head-quartered in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada and we are an Alberta Registered (Incorporation Number 5116595546) Non Profit organization with a very ambitious project to aggregate various information services into a convenient and easy to use Web 2.0 platform. Our stated objectives are ""To promote openess and transparency in all levels of government. To provide citizens easy access to government information that would be beneficial to their lives and/or their voting decisions. To enable citizens to easily interact with their representatives and the government as a whole."" 
To learn more visit our website: http://makethemworkforyou.com

We have spent the last 10 months developing the largest single database of information on Canadian politicians (over 600 and growing!) we aggregate information such as voting records, campaign finances and expenses as well as recent news and social media updates. We decided to take a ""bottom-up"" approach and focus on levels of government that most political apps/websites ignore so we started with some of the largest Canadian cities and provinces.
We currently track politicians from the following areas:
Federal: 120 of 308 politician (to be completed July 31, 2012)Provincial: Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Northwest Terriories, Nunavut, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan, YukonMunicipal: Calgary, Edmonton, Hamilton, Ottawa, Toronto, Vancouver, Winnipeg
 
And now we want to take our project to the next level!
What Are We Building?

We feel that people should have easy access to their politicians and to their government. We have features in mind that would combine the best of many political apps in the marketplace and leverage our extensive knowledge on Canadian politicians to provide interaction and features not seen in other apps. We will be offering both a paid ($0.99) and an ad-supported free version of the app.
Our app will be able to:

look up representatives at all 3 levels of government based on postal code or current GPS or aGPS location 
contact their representative through email, twitter, facebook, linkedin, or telephone
use our pre-formatted templates when contacting their representative
access all of the information on our website for any politician in our database
subscribe to a politician and receive updates when something new is added (includes google news updates and social media digests)
integration with our site calendars which contain political events for each area and level of government
display the news feed for selected level of government based on location
search our site and related government sites based on current location and level of government
report problems like pot holes, graffiti, etc using camera and GPS and send to the correct contact (only available where the municipal govt has a compatible service)

Unlike FDM (filament) printers the resin in the build tray is inadvertently exposed to UV radiation from sources such as indoor lighting. Over time, the resin in the vat degrades, which leads to failed prints. Resin is a consumable, so if you will be printing small things, your resin printer should suit your needs. The iBox Nano meets all your small print design needs.<div>

<p>The iBox Nano is designed for the home user who wants to print small to average sized 3D objects with good resolution without having a large noisy printer intruding on their workspace. The goals were to be small, quiet, inexpensive, and portable. We have achieved all of this for one specific target audience; you.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>3D Printing with Mobility; made possible with the iBox Nano</b></p>
<p>The iBox Nano is the worlds first truly portable 3D Resin Printer. Weighing only 3 pounds, it is small enough and light enough to just slide in your backpack, making it truly portable. Almost all 3D printers have several wires; a USB cable to connect to your computer and a power cable. The iBox Nano is WiFi enabled so you will never be tethered to your computer. It is also the worlds first battery powered 3D Resin Printer. The battery option* lasts approximately 10 hours.</p>
<p>The battery option, coupled with the Nano’s silent and completely wireless operation allows you to truly be mobile. You will be printing on the go at Starbucks, in the library, at a friends house, or at any location you desire. </p>

<p><b>We have silenced 3D Printing </b></p>
<p>3D Printers of all technologies have cooling fans and stepper motors. Both generate noise pollution. FDM printers use four stepper motors and generate a tremendous amount of random and distracting sounds. Projector and Laser 3D printers have one to two stepper motors and have high volume cooling fans which are inherently noisy.</p>

<p><b>The lowest energy consumption of any 3D printer</b></p>
<p>Whether you opt for our optional battery pack, power the iBox Nano from your notebook pc, or the included wall dongle, you will be happy to hear we have the worlds lowest power 3D printer. Consuming an order of magnitude less power than the next best printer. We offer optional 10 hour and 20 hour battery packs. These are external packs that connect via USB to your Nano. You will be able to purchase them in our online store.</p>

So why pay 2-3 thousand dollars for a large printer that will consume  space when a small  printer that can be placed almost anywhere will print everything you want?Large build plates on resin printers can also be a disadvantage. Unlike FDM (filament) printers the resin in the build tray is inadvertently exposed to UV radiation from sources such as indoor lighting. Over time, the resin in the vat degrades, which leads to failed prints. Resin is a consumable, so if you will be printing small things, your resin printer should suit your needs. The iBox Nano meets all your small print design needs.

iBox Printers has reset the bar
Most 3D printers are general tools designed to try and meet a broad spectrum of needs, and in doing so, they don't meet any one need precisely. 


The iBox Nano is designed for the home user who wants to print small to average sized 3D objects with good resolution without having a large noisy printer intruding on their workspace. The goals were to be small, quiet, inexpensive, and portable. We have achieved all of this for one specific target audience; you.

3D Printing with Mobility; made possible with the iBox Nano
The iBox Nano is the worlds first truly portable 3D Resin Printer. Weighing only 3 pounds, it is small enough and light enough to just slide in your backpack, making it truly portable. Almost all 3D printers have several wires; a USB cable to connect to your computer and a power cable. The iBox Nano is WiFi enabled so you will never be tethered to your computer. It is also the worlds first battery powered 3D Resin Printer. The battery option* lasts approximately 10 hours.
The battery option, coupled with the Nano’s silent and completely wireless operation allows you to truly be mobile. You will be printing on the go at Starbucks, in the library, at a friends house, or at any location you desire. 

We have silenced 3D Printing 
3D Printers of all technologies have cooling fans and stepper motors. Both generate noise pollution. FDM printers use four stepper motors and generate a tremendous amount of random and distracting sounds. Projector and Laser 3D printers have one to two stepper motors and have high volume cooling fans which are inherently noisy.

The lowest energy consumption of any 3D printer
Whether you opt for our optional battery pack, power the iBox Nano from your notebook pc, or the included wall dongle, you will be happy to hear we have the worlds lowest power 3D printer. Consuming an order of magnitude less power than the next best printer. We offer optional 10 hour and 20 hour battery packs. These are external packs that connect via USB to your Nano. You will be able to purchase them in our online store.

Advanced Materials
The iBox Nano is constructed of precision laser cut extruded acrylic. Also known as Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). It is 17 times stronger than glass and at only half the weight provides a beautiful yet durable structure where neither function nor form are compromised.

<p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>Thank you for looking at my project, I have been working on JAKIT for over two and a half years, but I believe the time, money and headaches have been worth it. Starting from an idea floating around in my head, to scribbled designs on bits of paper, to selling everything that wasn't nailed down to fund it, I now have a fully functioning fully tested and re-tested working sample which is all ready to go into mass production! </p>
<p>So far the Jakit project has been self funded, and through a passionate commitment, I am proud to have brought the project this far, but now <em>your</em> help is needed to introduce Jakit to the world...</p>
<h3><strong>OK, What is it?</strong></h3>
<p>The JAKIT it's a phone case with a big difference, and currently there is nothing on the market like the Jakit, and definitely nothing with the ability to switch OFF or ON your earphones! <em>(hold that thought)...</em></p>
<p>Tucked safely inside of the Jakit case are retractable earphones, and they are attached to your phone 24/7. <em>(still holding that thought)...</em></p>
<p>Once the Jakit is attached to your iPhone or Galaxy it need never be removed; <em>why is that?</em></p>
<p>Well, even though the Jack is permanently connected <em>(jacked)</em> into your phone, the Jakit has a little switch which turns the Jack connection between the Jakit and your phone ON or OFF. <em>(now do you see why I asked you to hold that thought)...</em></p>
<p>This <em>switch</em> gives you the option to use your phone normally as if the Jakit was not attached to your phone.</p>
<p>Any time you need your earphones, all you need to do, is switch the earphones on, extend the earphones from within the Jakit case, and you can go hands free, make calls, listen to music, play games or watch a movie.... <em>and never again will you have to worry about leaving home with out your earphones.</em></p>
<p>So, now you have no more worries about leaving home without your earphones, or untangling a birds nest of wires to use them. Also eliminating broken earphones at the bottom of your bag or purse, they can now live safely attached to your phone 24/7, and when you need them they will always be there! So in essence as long as your phone is with you, so are your earphones.</p>
<p><strong><em>No more Spaghetti (unless its with meatballs and garlic bread)</em></strong></p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdZ5ps2qNms"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdZ5ps2qNms</a></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The earphones have been specially designed and made for the Jakit product, by a company who love their earphones, and they have made sure that the sound quality is awesome, a little too awesome, if you can stand them to be at full volume <em>(not recommended!)</em>, they still sound perfect... </p>
<p>We have also attached a digital microphone for making calls, so your voice sounds crystal clear to whoever you are calling.  </p>
<p><strong><em>Jakit's, a work of art .....</em></strong></p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eOFhFZCPBk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eOFhFZCPBk</a></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The concept in mind when designing the Jakit, was to produce a high quality case for your phone, along with permanently attached retractable earphones, available to use whenever you may require them, but most importantly was to not interfere with the normal functionality of your phone, therefore Jakit only enhances the user experience.</p>
<p><em>So, not only can you switch OFF and ON your earphones, but this unique switch means that you can also use the loud speaker function on your phone, for conference calls or to share music (with no need to remove your Jakit), but also if your car is blue tooth enabled, the Jakit will not interfere with the car and phone connecting when entering your car (still without removing your Jakit).</em></p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Jakit up close and personal.........</h3>
<p><em>OK to summarise what a Jakit can do:<br/></em></p>
<p>1) It is a case that can be <strong>permanently attached to your phone</strong> <em>(The Jakit can be taken on or off in seconds and will not damage your smartphone at all)</em></p>
<p>2) The <strong>earphones</strong> are safely wound up inside the Jakit case, and are therefore <strong>available to use 24/7.</strong></p>
<p>3) As long as the Jakit is attached to your phone, the jack is permanently Jacked/connected into your phone, but the switch on <strong>the Jakit turns the earphones OFF or ON as you need them </strong><em>(patented design).</em></p>
<p>4) Because the Jakit can stay permanently attached to your phone, The Jakit has an ON/OFF switch so that you can <strong>switch your phone ON or OFF without removing the JAKIT</strong>.</p>
<p>5) The Jakit also has a switch on the side of the outer rim/casing, which by clicking it, will allow you to <strong>PLAY, PAUSE, FORWARD and REWIND your music</strong>, very easily.</p>
<p>6) When you are ready to store the earphones back inside the Jakit Case, simply connect the ear buds together <em>(they are magnetic and have specially designed grooves so they join together very easily).</em> Pull the cable straight, hold down the retract button on the side of the Jakit, and the cable/earphones will automatically rewind back inside the case.</p>
<p>7) When extracting the earphones, simply hold the ear buds between your finger and thumb and pull them out from inside the Jakit case, until they are extended to your desired length, fully extended they are over a metre in length, <em>(no need to push any buttons when the earphones are being extracted, it is only automated when rewinding the earphones).</em>  </p>

<h3>Face to face with Jakit..........</h3>
<p>The Jakit is currently designed to fit the iPhone 4/4s. Still, the Jakit has been designed in such a way that we can fit the inner workings into different Jakit phone cases, which we are currently in the process of completing the designs for. Even so, with over 200 million iPhone 4/4s out in the world, and Apple still manufacturing the iPhone 4s for the foreseeable future, we are confident that our first Jakit will have plenty of potential customers for some time yet.</p>

<h3><em>Easy charging access, and clear openings to allow you to use your phones loud speakers clearly.... so you need never remove your Jakit.</em></h3>
<h3><em> </em></h3>
<p>With your help, we hope to have a Jakit for the iPhone 5 and Galaxy S3 by March/April 2013, and in doing so, the aim is to evolve these two new Jakits to offer even more gadgets hidden inside the Jakit case. For example, we want to include battery packs to maximise your smartphone's usage time. In addition, we are trialling electric motors, solar panels amongst other things, all to enhance the Jakit users experience.</p>

<h3> </h3></div>","Jakit: The Story of a Revolution 
Hi Guys,
Thank you for looking at my project, I have been working on JAKIT for over two and a half years, but I believe the time, money and headaches have been worth it. Starting from an idea floating around in my head, to scribbled designs on bits of paper, to selling everything that wasn't nailed down to fund it, I now have a fully functioning fully tested and re-tested working sample which is all ready to go into mass production! 
So far the Jakit project has been self funded, and through a passionate commitment, I am proud to have brought the project this far, but now your help is needed to introduce Jakit to the world...
OK, What is it?
The JAKIT it's a phone case with a big difference, and currently there is nothing on the market like the Jakit, and definitely nothing with the ability to switch OFF or ON your earphones! (hold that thought)...
Tucked safely inside of the Jakit case are retractable earphones, and they are attached to your phone 24/7. (still holding that thought)...
Once the Jakit is attached to your iPhone or Galaxy it need never be removed; why is that?
Well, even though the Jack is permanently connected (jacked) into your phone, the Jakit has a little switch which turns the Jack connection between the Jakit and your phone ON or OFF. (now do you see why I asked you to hold that thought)...
This switch gives you the option to use your phone normally as if the Jakit was not attached to your phone.
Any time you need your earphones, all you need to do, is switch the earphones on, extend the earphones from within the Jakit case, and you can go hands free, make calls, listen to music, play games or watch a movie.... and never again will you have to worry about leaving home with out your earphones.
So, now you have no more worries about leaving home without your earphones, or untangling a birds nest of wires to use them. Also eliminating broken earphones at the bottom of your bag or purse, they can now live safely attached to your phone 24/7, and when you need them they will always be there! So in essence as long as your phone is with you, so are your earphones.
No more Spaghetti (unless its with meatballs and garlic bread)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdZ5ps2qNms
 
The earphones have been specially designed and made for the Jakit product, by a company who love their earphones, and they have made sure that the sound quality is awesome, a little too awesome, if you can stand them to be at full volume (not recommended!), they still sound perfect... 
We have also attached a digital microphone for making calls, so your voice sounds crystal clear to whoever you are calling.  
Jakit's, a work of art .....
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eOFhFZCPBk
 
The concept in mind when designing the Jakit, was to produce a high quality case for your phone, along with permanently attached retractable earphones, available to use whenever you may require them, but most importantly was to not interfere with the normal functionality of your phone, therefore Jakit only enhances the user experience.
So, not only can you switch OFF and ON your earphones, but this unique switch means that you can also use the loud speaker function on your phone, for conference calls or to share music (with no need to remove your Jakit), but also if your car is blue tooth enabled, the Jakit will not interfere with the car and phone connecting when entering your car (still without removing your Jakit).

 
Jakit up close and personal.........
OK to summarise what a Jakit can do:
1) It is a case that can be permanently attached to your phone (The Jakit can be taken on or off in seconds and will not damage your smartphone at all)
2) The earphones are safely wound up inside the Jakit case, and are therefore available to use 24/7.
3) As long as the Jakit is attached to your phone, the jack is permanently Jacked/connected into your phone, but the switch on the Jakit turns the earphones OFF or ON as you need them (patented design).
4) Because the Jakit can stay permanently attached to your phone, The Jakit has an ON/OFF switch so that you can switch your phone ON or OFF without removing the JAKIT.
5) The Jakit also has a switch on the side of the outer rim/casing, which by clicking it, will allow you to PLAY, PAUSE, FORWARD and REWIND your music, very easily.
6) When you are ready to store the earphones back inside the Jakit Case, simply connect the ear buds together (they are magnetic and have specially designed grooves so they join together very easily). Pull the cable straight, hold down the retract button on the side of the Jakit, and the cable/earphones will automatically rewind back inside the case.
7) When extracting the earphones, simply hold the ear buds between your finger and thumb and pull them out from inside the Jakit case, until they are extended to your desired length, fully extended they are over a metre in length, (no need to push any buttons when the earphones are being extracted, it is only automated when rewinding the earphones).  

Face to face with Jakit..........
The Jakit is currently designed to fit the iPhone 4/4s. Still, the Jakit has been designed in such a way that we can fit the inner workings into different Jakit phone cases, which we are currently in the process of completing the designs for. Even so, with over 200 million iPhone 4/4s out in the world, and Apple still manufacturing the iPhone 4s for the foreseeable future, we are confident that our first Jakit will have plenty of potential customers for some time yet.
 
Access to all your phone's buttons and switches


Easy charging access, and clear openings to allow you to use your phones loud speakers clearly.... so you need never remove your Jakit.
 
With your help, we hope to have a Jakit for the iPhone 5 and Galaxy S3 by March/April 2013, and in doing so, the aim is to evolve these two new Jakits to offer even more gadgets hidden inside the Jakit case. For example, we want to include battery packs to maximise your smartphone's usage time. In addition, we are trialling electric motors, solar panels amongst other things, all to enhance the Jakit users experience.
To keep you posted on future developments, keep an eye on www.jakit.co or www.jakitstore.com. Also follows us on Facebook.




 
The Jakit product has been designed from scratch, all the parts have been designed and made especially for this product, and in doing so we have used only the highest quality materials, which has given the Jakit its strength and durability...

If the indiegogo community get behind project Jakit over the next 28 days, then below are realistic Time Lines...

</h4><p>We are currently working with DAGNet Solutions, Inc<b> </b>to develop an app for smart phones that will help to put an end to this worldwide trend of accidents resulting from using cell phones while operating a car. We chose to develop this idea as an app since all of the major cell phone companies are phasing out non-smart phones, so eventually anyone using a mobile phone will be able to use this app. Most states have some kind of law in place regarding the use of cell phones while driving (<a href=""http://www.ghsa.org/html/stateinfo/laws/cellphone_laws.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">click here to see</a>). These laws are a great start but they do not prevent anyone from actually using a device behind the wheel. The enforcement of these laws will increase as the accidents continue. Not only is texting behind the wheel dangerous but it will become more and more costly to those that get caught as law enforcement increases.<br/></p><p>Several studies have been done to prove the dangers of even talking on a hands free device while driving. The overall message of these studies is that we cannot pay full attention to the road while using these devices. Sending or receiving a text is the most dangerous of them all because it combines the three types of driving distractions , visual, manual and cognitive. Texting behind the wheel takes a driver's eyes from the road for an average of 4.6 seconds. At 55 miles per hour the distance you would be driving blind would be the entire length of a football field. Anything that will take your brain power away from the road is the root of the problem and that includes conversations on hand held or hands free devices not just texting. <br/></p><p>We all need to make the personal choice to stop texting while driving and this app will help with that. Your automatic response sent to the texter will let them know that you did receive their message and it will be addressed when it is safe to do so. We can not solve this problem with laws alone. It is up to each and every one of us to develop new habits that will bring our full attention to the road ahead.<br/></p><h4><b>Here is the concept of the app.</b></h4><p> This app will automatically put your phone into the proper mode to match that states laws that you are driving in. When this app is installed onto your phone it will automatically respond to an incoming text or voice message if you are driving in a car that is traveling over 20 miles per hour. The prerecorded message will say something to the effect of ""<i>your message is important to me, however I am currently driving and I am unable to respond to you at this time. As soon as it is safe to do so I will return your call</i>"" or a text would read "" <i>I got your text, however I am driving right now. When it is safe to do so I will respond to you.</i>"" This app will be able to sense when your phone is moving over 20 miles per hour and automatically kick into this mode. An option to activate the app without moving will also be available. The app will always be active for texting over the 20 miles an hour. We feel that besides the fact that it is banned in 43 states, texting is the most dangerous distraction. Statistically not making or receiving calls/texts while driving is the same as removing a drunk driver off of the road. You have the same ""attention"" to driving while drunk as you do texting or talking on the phone. <br/></p><p>After the call or text has been responded to, the app will alert you of the event with a tone. If the text is urgent, that will be indicated so that you know you need to pull over as soon as possible to respond. <br/></p><p><i>-   I can not wait to have this on my phone! Right now I ignore the messages sent but I want the person to know that I am on the road and will call as soon as possible.

Also, when I am at work or any time that I do not want to be disturbed,  I will activate this app and set the appropriate message . I only want to respond to urgent messages while working so this would help to screen my text messages. When my son is old enough to drive I will have this on his phone as well.

'rounded edges' and to some extend 'curved edges' which only means the hard flat edges have been polished, they
are NOT physically curved like CINDER.</p>

NO plastic edges.CINDER is is PURE glass from curved edge to curved edge.Using the strongest Premium Tempered glass available.It is by far the most complex glass composite ever made for a screen protector.It's Glass. It's Tough.It's Seamless. It Curves.Save up to 60% now.
 CINDER comes in black and white.CINDER also fits the new iPhone 6s series.We recieve many really good questions during our campaign.Some of the questions are about the difference between CINDER and competitors trying to accomplish a curved edge solution.This is why we decided to do a comparison chart.CINDER is without a doubt the Next Gen of tempered glass screen protection for the iPhone 6 series.



'Cinder 0.2 mm Curved Gorilla Glass Screen Protector for iPhone 6:Thin, Curved and Beautiful!'
'Install was an absolute pleasure: fast, easy, and no pesky bubbles.'Video review:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2hWLLUQ4gI--



'The curved edges too are extremely smooth and very nice to the touch. 
Combined with the thinness, it makes pressing the home button very 
pleasurable and it certainly feels like there is truly nothing on the 
screen.'








'After a few days usage you didnt feel CINDER was there, it felt like a natural second skin' 'The installation was simple and easy'
The iPhone 6 has a unique design with curved sides. Even the glass front
has curved edges, designed to follow the curved design.
No existing tempered glass screen protector matches this design.They are all flat from egde to edge and leaves you with gaps and hard edges! 




Today's
technology is only able to produce flat screen protectors, as a result the
edges from today's screen protectors leave you with a big gap around your iPhone screen.
Your fingers and hands can easily catch on the floating edges. This is inconvenient and the protector can easily slip off again.





CINDER matches the design of the iPhone 6 Glass like no other Screen 
Protector without comprising its design and functionality in any way.








Using CINDER enhances the user experience in many ways while preserving the design and functionality of the iPhone 6:- Using the best Premium tempered glass available- The unique new oleophobic coating used on CINDER enhances the touch feeling - leaves a smooth buttery surface- Real Curved Glass Edges follows the exact shape of the iPhone glass edges- 0.20mm thickness provides an almost invisible protector without adding noticable weight- CINDER enhances the sharpness of the iPhone 6 screenCINDER squeezes 12 layers of protection, including a Premium tempered 
Glass, into only 0.20 mm, making it both impact and scratch resistant, 
and very very light.

CINDER will help you avoid expensive repairs (a replacement screen costs a minimum of $250). It will also prolong the life of your phone and help it keep its value. Second hand phones are given ratings now from A to C. With less wear and tear or marks CINDER will help you keep your phone in the best condition.  CINDER can pay for itself by doing its job... protecting your iPhone 6.


CINDER is easy to install and anyone can do it.
Maximum reusability.Our
 unique adhesive makes it possible to remove and apply CINDER again and 
again without affecting your iPhone or CINDER in any way.You dont need to get it right the first time. Just try again.You can even reuse CINDER in the future if needed.

We look forward to bringing CINDER to market and
appreciate all your help and support. You are probably wondering about now why we
chose to call our cutting edge iPhone protector CINDER. Well like the fairy
tale, CINDER is the only glass that fits... (and once this fact is realised she becomes an overnight success...) 

All
we want, is for you and your iPhone 6 to live happily ever after... and CINDER
can help make that happen.

We wish to raise $25,000 to begin full scale production.
This covers manufacturing, packaging, and all preparations for retail.










Important notice.Winner conditions are based on the amount of contributions achieved.We expect to begin shipping 4-6 weeks after this campaign ends.This means latest mid July.CINDER will ship Worldwide.UPDATE May 17th.We have made new Perks which includes Shipping fees.If you purchased before May 17th and forgot or somehow couldnt add the shipping at checkout please use the Perk named 'SHIPPING FEE - 1 CINDER'.You can find a Perk named 'Shipping - 1 CINDER'.

To make CINDER a reality we had to be very careful selecting
the perfect production facility. With such a complex product we need to control
all the elements.
To achieve an exact fit on the iPhone 6, ultra precision techniques and
machinery are needed.CINDER is all about the perfect fitting and to achieve this we had to use the
newest technology and the best possible manufacturing techniques. To give you
an idea, imagine a normal screen protector as an average family car and CINDER
as a Formula One car. That's the kind of leap we're talking about.
Our team of designers is based in Denmark, specializing in creating unmatched aesthetic appeal and functional value for the end user. Our research and development team, located in California USA, enables us to identify needs and develop solutions proactively, keeping us ahead of the competition.Our products are manufactured on an ISO-9001-certified factory with 8 years of
experience in the field, 'using the best engineering and facilities available
in glass production and working under the strictest standards for quality
control.'Cupert Technology, the name derived from its place of origin Cupertino, was founded in 2015.Cupert Technology is set to launch a complete range of cutting-edge mobile accessories that deliver unparalleled luxury and convenience for the users.
When will you ship CINDER?4-6 weeks after the campaign ends.This means latest mid July.How do I know if I get the correct CINDER?A few days after the campaign ends we sent out a survey asking for your specific choices.I forgot to buy shipping. What shall I do?No problem. You can always buy the shipping Perk.When campaign ends we will go through all contributions, and send out information to backers who couldnt find the correct way to add shipping costs.Other screen protectors say they have smooth edges, isn't
that the same? 
NO. Today's flat solutions use terms like 'smooth edges',
'rounded edges' and to some extend 'curved edges' which only means the hard flat edges have been polished, they
are NOT physically curved like CINDER.

I have seen some other brands with curved edges?Our competitors have tried to solve the problem by
adding aluminium, porcelain or even plastic to the edges, leaving you with a bad user
experience and the iPhone's design is compromised.

Is CINDER for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, and both colors?YESWhen the campaign is finished we will send out a survey to find out which model(s) you prefer.
How long will CINDER last? 
Applied correctly and treated well CINDER could outlast your
phone and as it is washable, you can actually swap it to a new phone if your
handset malfunctions for any reason.
Will CINDER stop my case from fitting?
A good question, but no we have tried CINDER with a number
of cases and it still fits in nearly all of them.
Is CINDER reusable?YESYou can remove and install CINDER many times. And even reuse it on another iPhone.

Will CINDER fit the new iPhone 6s series?
YESDo you ship Worldwide?
YESHow much is shipping costs?1 CINDER is $5. All shipping prices are listed in the perk information.Please remember to add this to your purchase.",37.0,2,"1 Campaign

In other words, this product is right in their wheelhouse.  Our Cable Manufacturing Facility - Testing RoomWe’ve spent the past six months iterating on the design, prototyping, and testing our concepts. We’ve covered the gamut on design ideas and feel we’ve struck the right balance of portability, usability, cost, and design. We’ve worked closely with our manufacturer to minimize any technical design challenges and ensure a high likelihood of production success. And, we also have a thorough understanding of the remaining development and parts costs. Testing an early prototype.We have been playing with the prototypes for weeks, and after showing them to friends for feedback, we've gotten an overwhelmingly positive response. We feel confident that this will be a great product. We're so confident in fact that we have even taken the step to begin production tooling now. This means tooling should be completed shortly after the campaign ends, which is great for our timeline. Our Indiegogo campaign will give us the funds to wrap up any legal issues and place our first production order. As always, our Indiegogo backers are the key to our success and we thank you for your support.",16.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p></p><p></p></div>","Com4tzone is a new way of viewing
personal and home security.     Com4tzone combines new and known features in home automation plus                      personal and HOME
security in one single easy-to-use App. 
    Now you need only one
App on your Smartphone to manage the settings and              level of security and
comfort both when your are Out and when you are HOME     The App is a key part of the user interface that can help family and
friends to              monitor your location if your are alone and uncomfortable, automate
your                    household appliances and control your alarms and sensors.                The
App also lets you preset the weekly rhythm of your home.           A calendar is used for
selecting a schedule for a soft illumination early in the                morning and a
slight increase when your family is busy getting ready for                        school and work.     The heat is lowered during daytime when your house is empty and                                   increased again
in the afternoon before the first person gets home. 
    You can also select
individual lamps and appliances to be switched on so                      the house is ready for
your family after a day’s work, and the light can be                      turned off automatically when you go to bed.    You
no longer need an expensive alarm central.     All you have to do is to add trusted
neighbors, friends and family as your                        helpers. They will be notified by a siren
and alarm message on their                                  Smartphone when something is wrong and the lights in
the house will start                  flashing.     You can easily see the location of your car and
follow your children, your                        spouse or your friends on Google map if they ask for
it.
    In every window of the free Com4tzone App there's on the top right an info                  icon. Here you can read about the functions of the window you are looking at.                                                                                                                                                   It's easy
    Feel
comfortable while at Home or when you are Out.     Com4tzone brings a new dimension
to your safety.     Ask those you trust to follow you or be ready to receive an                                                    alarm message in case you feel uncomfortable or unsecure.    It is free to use for you, your
friends and family.      Save money
on your electricity, water or heating bills.     Turn the lights on/off with your
smartphone or according to the Com4tzone                calendar.     Monitor your water usage or
regulate the temperature in every room/zone.     Watch live video in HD quality of
your property, no matter where you are in the            world.Smart devices for your comfort and security    IT’S
SIMPLY CLEVER! When you want to turn on your lights, you just press                the desired
button in the Com4tzone App.     A signal is sent to our server and on to a small
control box which is connected            to your router.     This control box sends a
wireless signal to the relay which is connected to the            lamp. The lamp turns on
within half a second.     One huge advantage is that you don’t need to replace any
of the household                  switches.                                                     We have carefully selected our suppliers of hardware parts                                                               to interact with our Com4tzone system/App                               Below you can see our hardware launch                                                     The campaign perks will be actual hardware that interacts with                                                                   the Com4tzone
App    Live Video System
                         
     Watch LIVE HD Video of your home or what you wish to see, no matter where             you are in the world.    You can invite friends and neighbors to watch your LIVE Video on their                          Smartphone by passing on the codes to them.     You can watch recordings on your Com4tzone User homepage.     The camera connects easily to your router, just scan a code in your                                  Com4tzone App and enter a user name and password, which you decide                        yourself, and press   CREATE.Smoke Sensor       It is
the smallest fire
alarm in the
world and very elegant in design.     When the alarm goes, you can hear a loud siren directly from the Smoke                        sensor.     All lights in your house will turn on while your appliances switch off                                  automatically.    It sends an alarm message to you and your helpers’ Smartphone with a loud                siren
and message
if
there is smoke or fire.                                                                      Flood Sensor                                                                                                  It is the smallest Flood sensor in the world and very elegant in design.    When the alarm sounds, the lights in the house will  turn on, and all your                        appliances will switch off automatically.     When the alarm goes, you can hear a loud siren directly from the Flood                          sensor.     It sends alarm message to you and your helpers’ smartphone with a loud siren            and an alarm message if there is water on the floor.                                                                   Multi Sensor

    This extremely small
Multi sensor
will let you know how many people
entered              or left your house or a given room.    It will automatically
turn on/off the lights as people enter/leave the
room.    Monitors the temperature of a room within a preset comfort interval.                              At too high a temperature from direct sunlight, the curtains will roll down                      automatically       If you do not come home before dark, the light will turn on and off as if you                    were at home. If you visit the bathroom at night a dim light will be turned on.                              Dimensions: 44 mm in diameter




Adaptor for Wall Switch  
    This
smal Wall plug is an intelligent wall adapter with an on/off
button. It fits                 into an existing outlet and checks the power consumption.     You
can enter
a budget
on
your Com4tzone user homepage which sends an                 alarm message to your Com4tzone App, when or
if
the budget is exceeded.     The
Wall plug fits all appliances, white goods, television sets, floor lamps, etc.              When you activate the alarm on the Com4tzone App and leave your home, the            Wall plug will turn off to save standby power while you are away.
    The
adapter interacts with Com4tzone’s calendar feature which allows you to             switch your lights on/off automatically.           On your Com4tzone App you can decide manual or automatic control
                                                                                       Relay for Lamp Socket                                           This Relay must be installed by a
qualified electrician,
either
in the electrical                 cabinet or into
a
power source and is therefore invisible.                                                       On your Com4tzone User homepage you can activate a set of favorite ligths,               e.g. 4 lamps in the same room/zone which turn on/off at the same time.    The Relay interacts with Com4tzone’s calendar feature which allows you to                  switch your lights on/off automatically.                                                                                        You
will
still have the option to turn the lights on/off and dim on the wall                        switch.     For each room/zone you can enter a budget for the power consumption on                  your Com4tzone User homepage which sends an alarm message to your                      Com4tzone App, if the budget is exceeded.     If you do not come home before dark, the Relay is connected to the light                        source which will turn on/off as if you were at home.          On your Com4tzone App you can decide manual or automatic control.            If the alarm is activated, you and your helpers will receive an alarm message               on your/their Smartphone, and all the lights connected to the Relay will start               flashing until you turn them off.  
                                                   That’s Clever
GPS Tracking Alarm
                             Dimension: 65 x 65 mm.    If you lock your security device on your Com4tzone App and your car gets                    stolen, the GPS tracker will send an alarm message with a loud siren to you                  and your helpers’ smartphone.      When the car is not in motion for more than 4 minutes, the GPS tracker will                  send the position of the car and you and your helpers can see precisely on the            map where the car is located.     The tracker has a battery life of 2-4 years and is supplied with a SIM card.    You can use the tracker for all vehicles, machinery, furniture etc.
                                              There are no limits

    Experience how easy it is to use. At the moment the app is available in Danish             and English, Com4tzone will of course be translatet into several laguages                     along the way, as our system/App is introduced to other countries.                                                                                    
    All the SOS functions of the App are FREE to
use, as well as parts of the GPS                functions. The remaining functions are
available in their DEMO version for you            to explore. Making them active
requires the purchase of the respective                          Com4tzone hardware devices, such as
Wall plugs and Relay.
    In every window of the free
Com4tzone App there's on the top right an info                  icon. Here you can read about
the functions of the window you are looking at.

CarGo Power: The Fastest Car Charger In the World!
Sure, sure - you've seen one,you've seen them all - but you've never seen the CarGo Power Car Charger Power-Bank. Check out the graphic to see where it's at:

Within 5 minutes flat, you have enough Power to recharge your iPhone with CarGo Power. 
More than that, you can recharge 6 iPhones with an hour charge of CarGo Power. No good a Power Bank if you need half a day to recharge the recharger...

 CarGo Power recharges your mobile devices super fast! The fastest Car Charger and Battery in the World. The Ultimate Power Cargo for All your mobile devices: iPhones, iPads, Mac's, Smartphones, Tablets, Phablets, Notebooks & Laptops.



We've reverse-engineered QC so that it works both ways. we didn't think that  the superfast  charging of your empty iPhone was good enough for you, so we decided you can also recharge your Camera,  portable Bluetooth speakers, wireless Headsets and printers.  
3 months into the development Welson, Mr. Chief Engineer said: ""Nah, we want people to be able to recharge CarGo Power ANYWHERE!"" 
So he took everything apart and popped in a Car Cigarette Lighter Charger and a USB charge port so you can draw power from any USB cable power source!





Packed with features any decent Super Charged Design should have and it does: CarGo Power runs on Smart tech.




""Durable Design"" so if you drop it you won't cry

""Cool Casing"" so you don't get burnt with Lightning Speed Recharges
""Super Smart Dial"" measures and counts the CarGo Power source
""Smart Light"" fluorescent blue glow-in-the-dark trim for power failures

<h2>What Is CommBadge™<span>?</span>
</h2>
<h3>CommBadge is a patent pending wearable Bluetooth speakerphone for iPhone and Android that attaches securely to your clothing. It uses the latest noise canceling chipset to minimize background noise. By combining proprietary directional and personalized speaker technology, CommBadge brings you crystal-clear handsfree communication. It's simple to use, yet amazingly convenient!</h3>
<h3>You'll have full access to Siri and Google Now voice command functions seamlessly. Also, you can customize CommBadge with the FREE companion app for iPhone and Android.*</h3>
<h2>Easy and Convenient to Use</h2>
<p>Simply by speaking and listening through your CommBadge, while leaving your phone in a pocket, purse or backpack, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Place and answer calls ears-free</li>
<li>Send and receive text messages (<em>“text-to-speech” through CommBadge</em>)</li>
<li>Use your phone's native voice commands, such as Siri, Google Now, or <span>S Voice</span> to set calendar events and reminders, get sports news, and search for information</li>
<li>Receive an alert from the Wireless Tether feature that you left your smartphone behind</li>
<li>Be notified of incoming calls, texts, calendar and social media events with customizable vibration, sound, and LED's</li>
<li>And more, all handsfree!</li>
</ul>
<h2><img alt=""Women using Siri Handsfree in the Kitchen"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://images.gizmag.com/gallery_lrg/commbadge_indie_go_go-3.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Women using Siri Handsfree in the Kitchen""/></h2>
<h2>The Background</h2>
</div>
<p>Technology has finally caught up with the science fiction that was first imagined by Gene Roddenberry in Star Trek The Next Generation and it was called <em>combadge</em>. Finally, there is a real CommBadge, it's a miniature speakerphone with big sound. It utilizes Bluetooth Low Energy (4.0) to pair with your iPhone or Android smartphone. CommBadge measures only 1.5"" (39 mm) in diameter.</p>
<div>
<h2>Can Everyone Around Me Hear My Conversation?</h2>
<p>The answer is no! One of the most important features of CommBadge, albeit the most time-consuming aspect of it's engineering, is the technology behind the speaker enclosure or ""cabinet"". Speaker cabinet design is a complex mixture of art and science.</p>
<p>In order to get crystal clear sound to the user, the enclosure is designed to prevent sound waves generated by the rearward-facing surface of the diaphragm of an open driver interacting with sound waves generated at the front of the driver. SORRY, what this all means is that we designed CommBadge so that the clean sound waves reach the users ears, but the sound waves that travel beyond a meter or so from the user are virtually scrambled. Therefore, someone near you can tell you are on a call, and not directly speaking to them, but they cannot discern the other end of your conversation. Thus, preventing that public Bluetooth headset syndrome of ""are you talking to me?"" in the supermarket line.</p>
<p><a href=""http://youtu.be/HNSQ9AUfB2E"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Personalized Speaker Technology"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/551812/pictures/full/20121124060726-Untitled.png?1353766051"" src="""" style="""" title=""Personalized Speaker Technology""/></a></p>
<p>Who cares anyway? Technology can sometimes seem quirky until it becomes ubiquitous. Nevertheless we solved this, with one quick tap you can transfer the call back to your smartphone.</p>
<h2><strong>Why Not Just Wear a Bluetooth Headset Instead?</strong></h2>
<div>
<p>I don’t know about you but I personally hate wearing a Bluetooth headset. I’ve tried tons of them, and they are all uncomfortable or annoying to me. However, holding your phone while busy at work or doing household chores is a pain. For many situations using a speakerphone is a better solution, and the only way to truly multitask. For example, cooking, walking the two dogs, home projects, and the list goes on.</p>
<p>So I started thinking. Why can’t I just wear a speakerphone? I did some online research and I couldn’t find anything! Then, about a year ago I started prototyping and experimenting with placement and functionality. The more I tested it in various environments, some being very noisy, the more I was blown away. Why hasn’t anyone done this I thought? So I formed a team of five to build a real CommBadge.</p>
<p>With today’s noise canceling technology wearing a speakerphone totally makes sense. It’s super convenient and really great with Siri too. Put your iPhone away, and you can still access Siri from a distance of up to 30 meters!</p>
</div>
<p>Furthermore, most people are required to wear an identification badge while at work. A lot of people use badge reels for their access convenience. That’s how the CommBadge came to life, combining an ID badge reel and a tiny speakerphone. It’s always with you, and great for lunch breaks, etc. After work, simply remove your ID badge and it becomes your personal assistant.</p>
<p>The uses are truly limitless; and you’ll be hands-free in your car if your car is not Bluetooth equipped. Once you start using it you’ll never go back to a Bluetooth headset. Science Fiction has now become a reality!</p>

<h2>What We Need and What You Get!</h2>
<p>The CommBadge demoed in the above video is an actual working pre-production model. CommBadge is beyond the prototype stage. After dozens of CAD redesigns, and over a dozen 3D printed prototypes we have finally nailed the design. We are ready for production! With your support, we can bring a real CommBadge to the world three centuries early!</p>
<p>While we have finalized the design for production, your contribution will move it from a functional pre-production model, to a finished commercial product. The CommBadge will require a number of manufacturing processes like final PCB design verification and then fabrication, as well as injection molding and stamping, all of which are very costly initially, which is why we're here on Indiegogo. Once the project ends, we will begin production testing shortly thereafter. We will be posting regular updates and contributors will be able to get an inside look at our progress. CommBadge can be worn in many ways. Also, it was engineered to replace your daily corporate ID badge reel with a badge reel plus micro-sized speakerphone that's a wearable designer device.</p>
<p>For our Indiegogo launch we will be offering it in three configurations. The first package will include one low profile CommBadge Classic (no ID badge holder) that you can wear for personal use. The second package will include one low profile CommBadge that you can wear and display your corporate ID badge in a thin and light configuration. The third package is the CommBadge<strong>+</strong>, the ""<strong>+</strong>"" adds a built-in retractable ID badge reel. Wear it just like you do your current corporate ID badge reel; either on your collar, shirt pocket, or hanging on a lanyard. After fulfillment, other accessories are in the works.</p>

What Is CommBadge™?

CommBadge is a patent pending wearable Bluetooth speakerphone for iPhone and Android that attaches securely to your clothing. It uses the latest noise canceling chipset to minimize background noise. By combining proprietary directional and personalized speaker technology, CommBadge brings you crystal-clear handsfree communication. It's simple to use, yet amazingly convenient!
You'll have full access to Siri and Google Now voice command functions seamlessly. Also, you can customize CommBadge with the FREE companion app for iPhone and Android.*
Easy and Convenient to Use
Simply by speaking and listening through your CommBadge, while leaving your phone in a pocket, purse or backpack, you can:

Place and answer calls ears-free
Send and receive text messages (“text-to-speech” through CommBadge)
Use your phone's native voice commands, such as Siri, Google Now, or S Voice to set calendar events and reminders, get sports news, and search for information
Receive an alert from the Wireless Tether feature that you left your smartphone behind
Be notified of incoming calls, texts, calendar and social media events with customizable vibration, sound, and LED's
And more, all handsfree!


The Background

Technology has finally caught up with the science fiction that was first imagined by Gene Roddenberry in Star Trek The Next Generation and it was called combadge. Finally, there is a real CommBadge, it's a miniature speakerphone with big sound. It utilizes Bluetooth Low Energy (4.0) to pair with your iPhone or Android smartphone. CommBadge measures only 1.5"" (39 mm) in diameter.

Can Everyone Around Me Hear My Conversation?
The answer is no! One of the most important features of CommBadge, albeit the most time-consuming aspect of it's engineering, is the technology behind the speaker enclosure or ""cabinet"". Speaker cabinet design is a complex mixture of art and science.
In order to get crystal clear sound to the user, the enclosure is designed to prevent sound waves generated by the rearward-facing surface of the diaphragm of an open driver interacting with sound waves generated at the front of the driver. SORRY, what this all means is that we designed CommBadge so that the clean sound waves reach the users ears, but the sound waves that travel beyond a meter or so from the user are virtually scrambled. Therefore, someone near you can tell you are on a call, and not directly speaking to them, but they cannot discern the other end of your conversation. Thus, preventing that public Bluetooth headset syndrome of ""are you talking to me?"" in the supermarket line.

Who cares anyway? Technology can sometimes seem quirky until it becomes ubiquitous. Nevertheless we solved this, with one quick tap you can transfer the call back to your smartphone.
Why Not Just Wear a Bluetooth Headset Instead?

I don’t know about you but I personally hate wearing a Bluetooth headset. I’ve tried tons of them, and they are all uncomfortable or annoying to me. However, holding your phone while busy at work or doing household chores is a pain. For many situations using a speakerphone is a better solution, and the only way to truly multitask. For example, cooking, walking the two dogs, home projects, and the list goes on.
So I started thinking. Why can’t I just wear a speakerphone? I did some online research and I couldn’t find anything! Then, about a year ago I started prototyping and experimenting with placement and functionality. The more I tested it in various environments, some being very noisy, the more I was blown away. Why hasn’t anyone done this I thought? So I formed a team of five to build a real CommBadge.
With today’s noise canceling technology wearing a speakerphone totally makes sense. It’s super convenient and really great with Siri too. Put your iPhone away, and you can still access Siri from a distance of up to 30 meters!

Furthermore, most people are required to wear an identification badge while at work. A lot of people use badge reels for their access convenience. That’s how the CommBadge came to life, combining an ID badge reel and a tiny speakerphone. It’s always with you, and great for lunch breaks, etc. After work, simply remove your ID badge and it becomes your personal assistant.
The uses are truly limitless; and you’ll be hands-free in your car if your car is not Bluetooth equipped. Once you start using it you’ll never go back to a Bluetooth headset. Science Fiction has now become a reality!

What We Need and What You Get!
The CommBadge demoed in the above video is an actual working pre-production model. CommBadge is beyond the prototype stage. After dozens of CAD redesigns, and over a dozen 3D printed prototypes we have finally nailed the design. We are ready for production! With your support, we can bring a real CommBadge to the world three centuries early!
While we have finalized the design for production, your contribution will move it from a functional pre-production model, to a finished commercial product. The CommBadge will require a number of manufacturing processes like final PCB design verification and then fabrication, as well as injection molding and stamping, all of which are very costly initially, which is why we're here on Indiegogo. Once the project ends, we will begin production testing shortly thereafter. We will be posting regular updates and contributors will be able to get an inside look at our progress. CommBadge can be worn in many ways. Also, it was engineered to replace your daily corporate ID badge reel with a badge reel plus micro-sized speakerphone that's a wearable designer device.
For our Indiegogo launch we will be offering it in three configurations. The first package will include one low profile CommBadge Classic (no ID badge holder) that you can wear for personal use. The second package will include one low profile CommBadge that you can wear and display your corporate ID badge in a thin and light configuration. The third package is the CommBadge+, the ""+"" adds a built-in retractable ID badge reel. Wear it just like you do your current corporate ID badge reel; either on your collar, shirt pocket, or hanging on a lanyard. After fulfillment, other accessories are in the works.

Latest Campaign Update
Exciting News! We are ready to open the APIs and provide a software development kit (SDK) to developers. This will add a whole new dimension of awesome applications, and in the near future, new but backward-compatible functionality. For example, a developer could design an app that provides voice annunciated caller ID, to verbally announce the names of incoming callers. The possibilities are truly limitless!
