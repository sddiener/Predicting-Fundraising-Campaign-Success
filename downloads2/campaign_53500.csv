<h3>What we stand for</h3>
<p>We originally opened MacGregor's Bar in Inverness because we are passionate about sharing the very best in Scottish food, drink, music and culture. We are an independent bar that wants to share the best in Highland hospitality for the local and the visitor. We are a bar that lives and breathes the spirit of the ceilidh and truly welcomes the world.</p>
<p>Since opening on St Andrew's Night 2017 we have been awarded</p>
<ul>
<li>Best Bar in Scotland (Visit Scotland Thistle Awards 2019)</li>
<li>Best Live Music Bar (Scottish Licensed Trade Awards 2019)</li>
<li>Best Concept Bar (Scottish Licensed Trade Awards 2018)</li>
<li>Best Bar in the Highlands (Highland Tourism Awards 2018)</li>
</ul>
<p>Our plan has always been to grow and take MacGregor's across the world, and we will....but things have slightly changed in the last year! We believe the Highlands of Scotland is the place for us to grow  and develop, but we need your help.</p>
<p>Hospitality has been hit hard during the pandemic but we see some amazing opportunities ahead.  We would love you to help us create another MacGregors in Golspie, right on the North Coast 500. The Ben Bhraggie Hotel is an ideal location for further developing our brand whilst offering something special to locals and visitors alike.</p>
<p>It is our mission to tell the world how amazing Scotland is.....but first, we're doing it small, and perfectly formed. We would love you to be part of it.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why it will work </h3>
<p>Locally: The local population have been crying out for a venue that offers great entertainment with food and drink. There are currently no restaurants in the town.</p>
<p>Nationally : The North Coast 500, the world renowned road trip around the North of Scotland, has become one of the ""must do"" priorities for the staycationer. The most visited attraction on this route is Dunrobin Castle which is a stonesthrow from our new site. </p>
<p>Golspie is aiming to become known as the 'Outdoors centre of the Highlands', with fantastic mountain biking, walking and golf for the visitor. It has stunning beaches and is surrounded by natural beauty.  </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need to raise £25,000 to help renovate the two bar areas, beer garden, kitchen and rooms.</li>
<li>This will allow us to create a special place on the North Coast 500 which really promotes the best of Highland culture and produce  </li>
<li>What we're offering you is a fantastic range of perks ranging from bar tabs to discount cards to limited edition merchandise.</li>
<li>If we don't reach our target then it'll take a bit longer to open, but every penny will be going into MacGregors MkII - Golspie, and our efforts to create something special.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>In a recent report by Highlands Islands Enterprise the lack of hospitality offerings was highlighted on every second page! We aim to create a community hub. </li>
<li>Being an independent bar means we can promote the things that we believe are important. For us that means Highland music and culture alongside brilliant local food and drink. A year round series of events will create a buzz throughout the area.  We also believe that if we create something special for the local community then the tourist experience will be made so much better. </li>
<li>We've done this before. We know we can create something beautiful and long-lasting, something that we can all be proud of. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We know the risks and challenges in this game. We've learnt so much in the last few years building our bar in Inverness. However we have now developed full training programmes and a whole series of systems and procedures which will make this next step less daunting. We've also built a fantastic team who are on board with us on this journey. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Maybe you can't get involved just now, but maybe you know others who might want to</p>

The biggest, best commercial burr set available in the most compact, countertop-saving design possible. The burrs and mount define the width of the product, making it more space-saving than grinders with burrs a fraction of the size. All more precise, alignable, and cleanable than anything else in the world.  Easily change between espresso, pour-over, French press, or AeroPress without having to redial your grind. The ""key"" to the perfect cup of coffee is achieving a consistent grind each time. No matter the method of extraction, the coffee will be optimally consistent for a smooth, even flavor. Virtually zero retention of coffee grounds in the burr grinder. Minimal oil residue, old coffee grounds, or flavors will ever come into contact when switching beans. No bean left behind.and, a LOT less cleaning. ""With its unbelievably small footprint and variable RPM 83mm conical burrs, it covers all styles of coffee preparation. I loved the auto-centering shaker and auto-mixing feature of the Magic Tumbler, both of which exemplify the build quality and craftsmanship I’ve come to expect from Doug and the team at Weber Workshops.""- Hide Izaki, 2014 World Barista Champion Integrated Weiss Distribution Technique (WDT) stirs the grounds as they drop from the burrs to break any remaining clumps.This creates an even distribution of grinds throughout the whole puck, allowing water to be pressed through evenly for ideal consistent extraction.Perfect for espresso and pour over. If you’re more in tune with your current coffee workflow, then our Standard Tumbler Standard Tumbler and Funnel - the same ones utilized in our HG-2 hand grinder - will get the job done for you. The Standard Tumbler fits perfectly on top of your 49mm AND 58mm portafilter (it has two ridges). Automatically magnetically centers under the funnel. Available as an add-on at check out.Pull the plug to cleanly release the grounds down into the portafilter, Aeropress, or coffee filter. No mess, no stress. A perfect streamlined workflow. KEY is engineered with 83mm TiN coated Mazzer Burrs that will deliver you quality grounds for a lifetime.We source our burrs exclusively from Mazzer, but apply our own unique secondary processes to partially season them so they are usable out of the box. We then seal in the edge with a life-prolonging and completely food-safe TiN coating. Perfect for the single-dosing café or the home.

<h3>What is Flower Dork?</h3>
<p>From delicate herbal liqueurs inspired by traditional apéritifs and digestifs to hedonistic barrel aged pastry inspired liqueurs: Flower Dork is a lil’ midwestern liqueur company celebrating our tasty world.</p>
<p>Unlike other spirit companies, we are 100% focused on making the best friggin’ liqueurs in the universe. Our bittersweet domination is scheduled to begin in Chicago, IL early 2022… but we need your help!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Perks</strong></h3>
<p>What do you get out of supporting us? Sick merch with our cool Flower Dork logo, handwritten (and doodled) thank you notes, t-shirts, beanies, fun branded glassware, and of course, vouchers for bottles of our product! Vouchers function like gift cards for our liquors, and must be exchanged in person (shipping alcohol is a whole can of worms we can't get into without lots more licensing), but if you can't make it up to Chicago, just let us know and we'll work something out.</p>
<p>All perks will be sent out after the campaign ends. Keep in mind that some things, like glassware, will probably take longer to send out than the stickers and haikus. We will keep you updated the whole way and let you know if anything comes up that causes any extra delays.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>The Budget</h3>Most of our funding from this campaign will go to production equipment, ingredients for the first batch, and fees for getting licensed in Illinois. Here's a breakdown of our total estimated budget:<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1625088667/jfbrcec8epeohyyjeifj.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>As you can see this equates to WAY over $25,000. Our goal for this campaign isn't everything we need to successfully make Flower Dork Spirits happen, but it is a huge step toward opening.</p>
<p>It takes a lot to start a business! Before we can start producing and selling products, we need to be approved by various government alphabet boys. This can take six months to a year to happen, or longer if we're very unlucky. Even if this campaign is successful, we still plan on applying for a small business loan to cover the costs of opening and staying open during the period in which production isn't possible.</p>
<p>So why are we campaigning for what will be a small chunk of our overall cost? <strong>This campaign is essential to measure and show the demand for our products!</strong> Once completed, it will be something we can show banks and investors to prove there is potential for profit. I know, I know! It would be great if we could just make fun liqueurs without having to worry about money, but unfortunately, we gotta make that Big Green to do our dream job.</p>
<p>In addition, this campaign will help us create excitement around our opening, and involve fellow local liquor enthusiasts in our foundation. We love our community and want you all to be a part of Flower Dork from the very beginning.</p>
<p>All this means if we don't reach our goal, not all is lost! We will put the funding we did get toward the most important costs, reassess our strategy, and then push forward.</p>

Check out vaelabs.com for the most up to date information.51 energizing sprays in one VAE! Each VAE packs 51 energizing sprays to keep you alert, focused, and energized in a matter of seconds. Designed to provide 2-3 weeks of energy, VAE is there for you whenever you need it.   Sprayed onto your tongue, VAE is quick and convenient whenever you need a boost. VAE easily fits into your pocket or purse. With its sleek design, it complements any style.  VAE was created for the ""doer"", people who work hard and get stuff done. Whether you are on your feet all day, or working from home, VAE is there to get you through your tasks.     To Get A Jumpstart On Your Morning For A Quick Boost At The Gym Or For Blasting Through Your WorkThough its primary ingredient is caffeine, VAE also contains 2 additional ingredients that reduce the caffeine jitters and crash. With these, VAE is made of 6 components: water, caffeine, NALT, Rhodiola rosea, three sweeteners (sucralose, ace k and xylitol) and natural flavoring. We take our health and yours very seriously, so we chose to use only a small number of highly effective ingredients to provide a clean energy experience.  VAE comes in two sleek variants: black/gold and white/rose-gold! A survey will be provided after the campaign has finished to select your options. We are launching with two delicious flavors: Mango Sunrise and Icy Mint, but a mystery flavor will be unlocked if we reach our second stretch goal!A survey will be provided after the campaign has finished to select your flavors.  We thoroughly believe in transparency at VAE, which is why we are open about how we settled on our projected delivery date.With your funding, we will be able to finish the production mold of our bottle and begin manufacturing midway through our campaign.  We estimate this will take up to three months to complete. Liquid manufacturing will be completed during this time and filling will take another 3-4 weeks, so we anticipate being to ready to ship to our first backers by February 2021. We will keep everyone updated as we progress through this process. The solution is ready and the prototypes have been made, but we'll need your support to bring VAE into production! We don't know when we will be accepting orders next, so make sure to purchase enough to last the wait!  VAE fits snugly in the palm of your hand, designed for convenience and portability. At the intersection of form and function, our design fits the modern aesthetic, a perfect addition to your everyday kit alongside your wallet and keys. Our PocketSafe™ locking mechanism ensures that you don't get any unwanted sprays going off in your purse or pocket as you move about your busy day. With VAE in your pocket, you never have to worry about being tired again.  Chaim and Mohand began their journey at McGill University, both majoring in Neuroscience. In this rigorous field, the two friends noticed their classmates struggling to keep up with the work. Many of them turned to energy drinks and caffeine pills in order to study the long nights and to stay alert. They knew there had to be a safer, smarter way.So, they got to work. After two years of research and testing, VAE was created. Mohand Khouider - CEOMohand is currently studying at McGill Law School after graduating with a B.Sc. in Neuroscience. He has extensive experience in neuroscience research, ranging from identifying biomarkers for early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease to designing and leading a clinical study on the effects of tDCS on implicit motor learning. Utilizing his knowledge of neuroscience, leadership, and law, Mohand leads VAE's expansion into the energy market. Chaim Weinerman - CTOChaim recently graduated from McGill University with a B.Sc. in Neuroscience. His past projects include working in multiple neuroscience labs from conducting clinical trials researching the neural processes behind epilepsy to designing and creating brain-machine interfaces. With his strong background in chemistry, project design and implementation, Chaim is heavily involved in the development and refinement processes at VAE. It's been a three-year-long journey since we initially had the idea for this product. We were always convinced of its potential to help people make the most out of their day and are excited to finally bring you VAE - our vision for how energy should be. 
 


 
 
 
   Each VAE contains as much caffeine as 16 energy drinks, so using a single VAE means less mining of aluminum and less waste. In addition, we will be rolling out a bottle recycling program as part of our commitment to environmental sustainability. Thanks to the initial seed funding we received, we were able to go through the industrial design process and finalize our prototypes. We need your help to fund our production run so we can take VAE to market. In return, you will be the very first to try VAE, and be among the first to get your energy in a smarter, healthier way. With your help, VAE will introduce the world to the future of energy. If our campaign is successfully funded, we'll be able to move toward a refillable model. These reusable bottles will make VAE even more environmentally friendly. In addition, by backing VAE, you are not only supporting this product but also future cutting-edge innovations our team creates. And we've got a lot planned.Here's a quick taste of some other projects Chaim and Mohand have worked on in the past:  A Levitating Wind Turbine

The superconducting levitation component 
 


The 1/10th scale Levitating Wind Turbine being tested in the lab
 
A Mind-Controled Robot (Using EEG)

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The idea for Charter Smoke BBQ originated from of our love of great tasting BBQ and the sense of community that it brings. Growing up in New England we felt that the art of smoked meats was bound by way too much tradition. In Kansas City they use a tomato base, in the Carolinas and Georgia mostly vinegar or mustard, in Texas they use no sauce at all. Why so many rules? </p>
<p>That’s why we set out to see what a “New American” BBQ could be. Why not put a Carolina vinegar sauce on chicken?  Why not create a sauce with maple syrup or coriander?  Why let tradition dictate what goes with what? Can't we just do what tastes good? Our idea was to take the Best parts of southern BBQ and blend them together with a little New England twist. So that’s exactly what we did!</p>
<p>Charter Smoke’s Mission is to bring professional quality New England inspired sauces and rubs to you, your family and friends.  We challenge age old BBQ traditions to create a “New American” BBQ.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>We thank you all who have supported our project.<p>I am Hope Kemirembe the leader of the project.The project is based in rural area of Kabale  District.</p>
<p>The project was started by we the women peasants in Mparo Parish,Rwamucucu Sub-county Rukiga-Kabale in South western Uganda.</p>
<p>The purpose of the project is to make sure the indigenous good seeds which reproduce good seeds are not made to diminish by the organizations promoting and selling genetically modified seeds which cannot produce seeds but make the peasant continue buying seeds every time of planting.</p>
<p>It also serves as source of food for the participants as well as selling extra as an income generating project</p>
<p>It also helps directly and indirectly promotes plant food against people destroying animals as source of food.</p>
<p>We also use natural organic farmyard manure AND ALSO FERTILIZERS OF OUR  OWN INNOVATION that does not contain chemicals and which improves soils.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>20 kilograms of seeds yield approximately 100 kilogrammes on harvesting.</p>
<p>Bean seeds cost Uganda Shs 3000/- per kilogram while Maize seeds cost Uganda Shs 2000/- per kilogram</p>
<p>20 Kgs of Bean seeds cost Uganda Shs 60,000/- while 20 kgs Maize seeds cost 40,000/- .Totaling to Uganda Shillings 100,000/- (One hundred thousands).This makes the package for  one woman.</p>
<p>We wish to increase the number of SEND A SEED members by 40 thus having a sixty women members  which will enable them multiply the seeds quickly on harvesting and giving the same amount of seeds each woman to another woman who then joins the group.</p>
<p>To provide such an amount to 40 women peasants</p>
<p>40x 100,000/- = 4,000,000/= (Uganda Shillings Four millions)</p>
<p>Equivalent to Euros 1000</p>
<p>We raised Euros 420 from the previous campaign. We are receiving Euros  360.</p>
<p>So we need  Euros 640 Equivalent to British Pound Sterling 510</p>
<p>This is the amount we are fundraising for.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>So in September 2018 we started the project as three women .Now we have grown in number to 20.Had it not been the break out of COVID-19 pandemic we could by now have even reached 40 but because of the COVID-19 we had last year to share most of the seeds with others living in town who were under lock-down and had no source of food as the promised food from Government was not provided. Also unlike in the past where we would work as a group and attend a single member's garden to completion before we could go to another one's garden,now with the break out of COVID-19 and social distance being one of the measures to take to avoid contracting and spreading COVID-19,each member attend her garden separately.We don't have tractors which could easy the digging work. Also our land is fragmented,so we move from garden to garden several kilometeres of distances apart.</p>
<p>All in all our determination coupled by support locally and international makes the project keep moving.</p>

</div><p><strong>NEW: This campaign is remaining with less than 2 days to close.</strong></p><p><strong>Help make it happen by contributing to it.</strong></p><p><strong>THANK YOU</strong></p></div>","Short SummaryWe thank you all who have supported our project.I am Hope Kemirembe the leader of the project.The project is based in rural area of Kabale  District.
The project was started by we the women peasants in Mparo Parish,Rwamucucu Sub-county Rukiga-Kabale in South western Uganda.
The purpose of the project is to make sure the indigenous good seeds which reproduce good seeds are not made to diminish by the organizations promoting and selling genetically modified seeds which cannot produce seeds but make the peasant continue buying seeds every time of planting.
It also serves as source of food for the participants as well as selling extra as an income generating project
It also helps directly and indirectly promotes plant food against people destroying animals as source of food.
We also use natural organic farmyard manure AND ALSO FERTILIZERS OF OUR  OWN INNOVATION that does not contain chemicals and which improves soils.

What We Need & What You Get
20 kilograms of seeds yield approximately 100 kilogrammes on harvesting.
Bean seeds cost Uganda Shs 3000/- per kilogram while Maize seeds cost Uganda Shs 2000/- per kilogram
20 Kgs of Bean seeds cost Uganda Shs 60,000/- while 20 kgs Maize seeds cost 40,000/- .Totaling to Uganda Shillings 100,000/- (One hundred thousands).This makes the package for  one woman.
We wish to increase the number of SEND A SEED members by 40 thus having a sixty women members  which will enable them multiply the seeds quickly on harvesting and giving the same amount of seeds each woman to another woman who then joins the group.
To provide such an amount to 40 women peasants
40x 100,000/- = 4,000,000/= (Uganda Shillings Four millions)
Equivalent to Euros 1000
We raised Euros 420 from the previous campaign. We are receiving Euros  360.
So we need  Euros 640 Equivalent to British Pound Sterling 510
This is the amount we are fundraising for.

The Impact
We started with bean and maize seeds in that once a home has a good harvest of these two seeds it can have a reasonable diet source and food security. Especially so in times like this during the COVID-19 pandemic where nutritious food is key to survive the virus.
With SEND A SEED. The women peasants, who are provided seeds, grow them and on harvesting they provide the same amount of seeds that they were given, to another woman peasant each. Then use the remaining as seeds and some as for food and extra sold for income to cater for other basic needs of the families.Hence the name SEND A SEED.

Risks & Challenges
So in September 2018 we started the project as three women .Now we have grown in number to 20.Had it not been the break out of COVID-19 pandemic we could by now have even reached 40 but because of the COVID-19 we had last year to share most of the seeds with others living in town who were under lock-down and had no source of food as the promised food from Government was not provided.

Also our land is fragmented,so we move from garden to garden several kilometeres of distances apart.
All in all our determination coupled by support locally and international makes the project keep moving.

<p><strong>A Café for BS</strong></p>
<p>A couple of years ago, the small, private coffee shops in Blue Springs began closing or changing ownership. We realized Tammy was no longer going to have anywhere to write and our weekly coffee dates were being relegated to bigger chain shops.</p>
<p>So one day, we thought, why not start up our own? Tammy would do the baking and we could bring good, Kansas City-area coffees to town. Barry has always wanted to cook, so he could stretch his culinary muscles as well. If we’re going to do this mid-life crisis thing, let’s do it right! Thus, Le Café Bleu was born.</p>
<p>We wanted to be downtown, in the heart of the community, and be part of the growth we hope will come to Main Street. It took a while, but we found a place to set up shop. We’ll be serving coffee, local beer and wine all day; pastries in the morning, sandwiches and soups at lunch and small plates during happy hour.</p>
<p>Our goal is to bring as much of KC to BS as we can. We will be highlighting local roasters like Blip and Thou Mayest. We’ll be working with area farmers as much as possible and the menu items will change frequently, as their harvests/offerings do. </p>
<p>So please, come join us in our adventure! See below how you can help get us up, running and on track for success.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We are trying to raise $10,000 for Le Café Bleu in the next three-four weeks. The funds will go toward final expenses as we get up and running.  </p>

For those who haven't, or for those that need a refresher, feel free to educate yourselves on Boroughs history. If you're not interested in that stuff then skip down to all the swag that you can get for yourself!</p><p>Greg and Josh first got to know each other as they were lowly employees at the Brooklyn CVS. Shortly after, we became roommates in Willimantic as we were both enrolled at ECSU. In our free time we were huge supporters of beer, but were never satisfied with the generic stuff we were surrounded by.  We wanted something different, something more satisfying, something with flavor. A few beers that come to mind from our college days are Killians irish red, Magic Hat #9, Sam Summer Ale, etc. We were always searching for the next new thing in the beer world, and the rest is history.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627593377/oqiqagzguhe319ohdbet.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Yikes, Greg without weight and Josh with hair! An oldie but a goodie. </p><p>After college, we went our own separate ways as is usually the case. I quickly took to homebrewing with a couple different brew kits. After a few years, we had both moved back to our hometown of Danielson, and I invited Josh over for a brew day. We brewed our first beer together in 2017 and Josh was immediately hooked as well. Since that day, we have brewed religiously every weekend or every other weekend for the past 4 years or so. </p><p>We wasted no time in sharing our beer with family, friends, friends of friends, co-workers, strangers, you get it; literally everyone that was willing to drink a beer, we were putting a bottle of our stuff in their hands. We are both humble people so gathering as much constructive criticism as possible was exciting to us. This allowed us to determine which recipes were fan favorites or which recipes needed some tweaking.</p><p>Eventually, that model of feedback wasn't enough for us and we started entering into local and not so local BJCP sanctioned competitions. We entered 13 beers into competitions from 2018 through the first couple months of 2020 (seriously, screw you Covid). In that short time frame, we took home 7 awards from those 13 entries. This is when we felt fully validated that the product we were making was legit. </p><p>It's been a long road filled with set backs and hurdles galore, but here we still stand, pushing forward towards our dream. </p><p> </p><h2><strong>Why you matter!</strong></h2><p>As some of you already know, we will be moving into Black Pond Brewing's current location of 21A Furnace Street, as soon as they are able to fully move into their new facility. We have already gotten our federal TTB license approved, and the Town of Killingly has already signed off on their portion of our state application. The next step for us is to submit the state application and wait for them to do their thing. However this process can take months and this will be the final hurdle before we can open our doors to the public. </p><p>We have used our personal finances to acquire a 3.5 BBL brewing system along with three 3.5 BBL stainless steel fermenters, along with several other pieces of equipment. We will be purchasing some supplies from Black Pond and are essentially moving into a turn-key brewing operation.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627670223/ena8b20osmdx3bbmnpgp.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Road trip to Western Pennsylvania netted us these two beauties.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627670285/rn4aypjjwlu465f9un3m.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Only had to drive down to Niantic for this beast </p><p>Also, we have acquired funding from the Town of Killingly that is allocated to new businesses in the downtown area.

We want to create a space where you won't see Black Pond Brews when you walk into our taproom. We want you to see The Boroughs Brewing Company. Well, when we put our budget together for the Town of Killingly, it was before the great lumber and material shortage of 2021 (no really, Covid.. you've overstayed your welcome). The cost of renovations we will be performing on the taproom, are now starting to significantly eat into our working capital. </p><p>We're asking you to help us out with funding so we can more comfortably handle any random situation that may pop up between now and when our doors open. That could involve buying brewing materials, paying for rent, or just holding onto as a break glass in case of emergency fund. Either way, what's important to us is that we make sure our bases are covered at all times so we can avoid getting blindsided with any potential bad news. Also, if you could spread the word about our brewery and the crowdfunding campaign, it would be greatly appreciated!</p><p> </p><h2><strong>What you get!</strong></h2><p>Now that we've talked about ourselves long enough, let's move onto what you can get out of all of this. We will be including 2 Boroughs Brewing coasters with every prize awarded and an invitation to a special event for all of our supporters. At this event, we will have our 2019 Harmonies and Hops brew fest banner and we'll ask everyone to sign their names.

For those who haven't, or for those that need a refresher, feel free to educate yourselves on Boroughs history. If you're not interested in that stuff then skip down to all the swag that you can get for yourself!Greg and Josh first got to know each other as they were lowly employees at the Brooklyn CVS. Shortly after, we became roommates in Willimantic as we were both enrolled at ECSU. In our free time we were huge supporters of beer, but were never satisfied with the generic stuff we were surrounded by.  We wanted something different, something more satisfying, something with flavor. A few beers that come to mind from our college days are Killians irish red, Magic Hat #9, Sam Summer Ale, etc. We were always searching for the next new thing in the beer world, and the rest is history.Yikes, Greg without weight and Josh with hair! An oldie but a goodie. After college, we went our own separate ways as is usually the case. I quickly took to homebrewing with a couple different brew kits. After a few years, we had both moved back to our hometown of Danielson, and I invited Josh over for a brew day. We brewed our first beer together in 2017 and Josh was immediately hooked as well. Since that day, we have brewed religiously every weekend or every other weekend for the past 4 years or so. We wasted no time in sharing our beer with family, friends, friends of friends, co-workers, strangers, you get it; literally everyone that was willing to drink a beer, we were putting a bottle of our stuff in their hands. We are both humble people so gathering as much constructive criticism as possible was exciting to us. This allowed us to determine which recipes were fan favorites or which recipes needed some tweaking.Eventually, that model of feedback wasn't enough for us and we started entering into local and not so local BJCP sanctioned competitions. We entered 13 beers into competitions from 2018 through the first couple months of 2020 (seriously, screw you Covid). In that short time frame, we took home 7 awards from those 13 entries. This is when we felt fully validated that the product we were making was legit. It's been a long road filled with set backs and hurdles galore, but here we still stand, pushing forward towards our dream.  Why you matter!As some of you already know, we will be moving into Black Pond Brewing's current location of 21A Furnace Street, as soon as they are able to fully move into their new facility. We have already gotten our federal TTB license approved, and the Town of Killingly has already signed off on their portion of our state application. The next step for us is to submit the state application and wait for them to do their thing. However this process can take months and this will be the final hurdle before we can open our doors to the public. We have used our personal finances to acquire a 3.5 BBL brewing system along with three 3.5 BBL stainless steel fermenters, along with several other pieces of equipment. We will be purchasing some supplies from Black Pond and are essentially moving into a turn-key brewing operation.Road trip to Western Pennsylvania netted us these two beauties.Only had to drive down to Niantic for this beast Also, we have acquired funding from the Town of Killingly that is allocated to new businesses in the downtown area. All of the steps taken by us were done in a meticulous manner to avoid extravagant startup costs because nobody enjoys crippling debt, right? Well, we are no different!So why are we turning to all of our friends, family, supporters, and possible newcomers now? We want to create a space where you won't see Black Pond Brews when you walk into our taproom. We want you to see The Boroughs Brewing Company. Well, when we put our budget together for the Town of Killingly, it was before the great lumber and material shortage of 2021 (no really, Covid.. you've overstayed your welcome). The cost of renovations we will be performing on the taproom, are now starting to significantly eat into our working capital. We're asking you to help us out with funding so we can more comfortably handle any random situation that may pop up between now and when our doors open. That could involve buying brewing materials, paying for rent, or just holding onto as a break glass in case of emergency fund. Either way, what's important to us is that we make sure our bases are covered at all times so we can avoid getting blindsided with any potential bad news. Also, if you could spread the word about our brewery and the crowdfunding campaign, it would be greatly appreciated! What you get!Now that we've talked about ourselves long enough, let's move onto what you can get out of all of this. We will be including 2 Boroughs Brewing coasters with every prize awarded and an invitation to a special event for all of our supporters. At this event, we will have our 2019 Harmonies and Hops brew fest banner and we'll ask everyone to sign their names. After we open fully, the banner with signatures of our supporters, will be framed and hung in the taproom for all to see!Our first brew fest banner with our original logo could be signed by you and put on display for everyone to see! Simple DonationNot a fan of any of the merch available, but still want to help support us? No problem! Here's a way to support us with no strings attached. When you pop in for a beer we can thank you with a hand shake, elbow bump, hug, or whatever you feel comfortable with.

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">What is Sewell Sweets?</span></h3>
<p>Sewell Sweets Artisan Cakes was previously a custom-order-only cake shop run from a private licensed kitchen, but that's all about to change with the opening of a bakery storefront! Cat, the one woman who has run the show, has had her heart set on opening a storefront from the young age of 13 and it's never wavered. It all started with small orders and kid's birthday cakes, then grew to high end wedding cakes and hand made sugar flowers.  Sewell Sweets has become known around the PDX metro area for high end wedding cakes in the last several years. With a storefront though, Cat will be able to continue making gorgeous wedding cakes, but also once again she'll be able to create birthday cakes and now small treats to fill the bakery cases with, too. Her hope is that every day can feel a little more like a high end celebration for everyone who comes in the shop!</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Sewell Sweets needs your help to raise funds to open! Cat has been buying and storing a few pieces of large equipment over the years already, like a big 20 qt. Hobart mixer, a fondant sheeter, and most recently even a commercial bakery oven. There is still about $25,000 of bakery equipment and small wares </span><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">needed such as refrigerators, freezers, food cases, work tops, coffee machines, and the like. There's also going to be construction costs within the space that we are in negotiations with right now to get everything plumbed, hooked up, and ready for customers. All funds raised will go directly to purchasing equipment, outfitting the space, and if by chance we raise more than that covers, the rest will go to buying starting ingredients and packaging to make all of the delicious goods! If we don't reach our goal, the funds raised will still go towards buying equipment. If we don't raise enough funds to get into the specific storefront we're working with right now in downtown Salem, we will use the funds to get into a different storefront. Regardless, this dream is happening people!</span></p>

<h3>The Extra Fluff <i>-</i>
</h3>
<p>Sugar, flour, butter, vanilla...sure, they're great starting points for any recipe but they mean a lot more to Cat than just ingredients. Cake has allowed Cat to connect with people over the years, to find her calling, her happy place, and her way to make a difference in people's lives with her edible art. For years Sewell Sweets has been a successful tiny business but has had to share Cat with raising kids, full time jobs, and the daily life of a wife and mother. It's time for Sewell Sweets to come to the forefront now! Sewell Sweets will be a beautiful space for the community to enjoy each other, to celebrate the big and small milestones, and to see dreams happening! The storefront will be a place to get a great cup of drip coffee, an espresso drink, or quality brewed cup of tea, there will be oodles of goodies to choose from in the bakery cases such as cookies, tarts, cupcakes, and Sewell Sweets' unique cake flavors by the slice or whole, as well as ordering your birthday, all occasion, or wedding cakes! Come sit on our pink comfy couches and soak in our dream space! Cat and her family have always been big supporters of shopping small and local and they are ecstatic to get to do so once again with a local downtown Salem storefront of their own, outfitted with Salem bought equipment, and hired hands to help. Sewell Sweets believes small businesses can do big things!  </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Money! That's our biggest hardship right now and for a small business, it's a giant one. Our seed money was supposed to be our profit from the 2020 wedding season. We were lined up with our biggest year ahead of us full of incredible wedding cakes, but Covid-19 took that all away from us. All of our 2020 weddings were cancelled, and with them, our seed money was gone. About half of those weddings never ended up happening as couples decided to elope and do small private weddings instead, and the remaining weddings were rescheduled over the next 2 years and all but one haven't even happened yet. But here we are, ready to open up shop, and now we need help with the funding. Bakery equipment is very expensive. It's designed to last for years of daily use, so once we get ours, it will take us far. We have applications out with the SBA and other sources for small business loans, and we have our personal money invested as well. None of this will compare with the help that you, the general public, can offer us, and none of it will mean quite the same as yours will!</p>

Equipped with our redesigned honeycomb pattern for the perfect non-stick cooking experience, and a handle that remains cool whatever your heat source. All for a fair price.Just as strong as traditional cast iron, but 50% lighter thanks to the pressed casting innovation technique. The Buccaneer is produced through pressed casting, allowing more pressure compared to traditional sand casting. This ensures thinner walls and 50% less weight than a traditional cast iron skillet without compromising on performance. The handle of the Buccaneer was originally created for the Blackbeard frying pan, one of our previous campaigns.

Thanks to the well-thought-out thin attachment to the pan, burned hands or tinkering with potholders is history!   Since the Buccaneer is made from cast iron, it can be used on all heat sources including gas, induction, ceramic and electric. It can even be put in the oven or on the barbeque.Our honeycomb pattern ensures better substance distribution, which enlarges the cooking area, even with a little oil or butter. This creates the perfect non-stick cooking experience, as well as our famous Crowd Cookware stamp.Due to its weight, the pan is easy to hold and perfect for everyday use.

Even the insulated metal mug was designed as a simple vessel—a means to an end for consuming coffee without any purpose or thought for enhancing the flavor or the drinking experience.    Ordinary mugs (3000 BC) were not designed to focus aroma or enhance taste. Likewise, insulated mugs (1980 AD) conceal aroma and hinder taste due to the lid and small opening. The wine and spirit industries have spent decades taking a scientific approach to creating the perfect glass shapes that improve taste, aroma, and flavor.  Connoisseurs of these drinks have figured out that the type of glass you serve it in can make or break the entire drinking experience—they consider their glasses the MOST important tool for the fullest appreciation of taste, aroma, and flavor.  The modern wine glass (1950 AD) and whiskey glass (2001 AD) are designed to allow the beverage to aerate and oxidize through swirling, which helps to volatilize the beautifully fragrant aromatics.This is what inspired the AVENSI–a revolutionary glass that combines the science and engineering of wine and spirit glasses with what was missing from coffee. The result is a new category of coffee cup that allows you to taste and appreciate your coffee in a way never before possible.  AVENSI transforms coffee drinking from quick consumption to an immersive experience.It’s time for you to unlock a new way of enjoying coffee. Before we tell you more about the AVENSI, it’s important to share how it became a reality.Creating the world’s best coffee cup is no simple task.We had a big vision: to change the way coffee is appreciated around the world. A vision this big could only be possible by working with the passionate coffee community from around the globe–people who love coffee and care about making it better.  One of our many experiments to test our prototypes. This one with Gabriel Carol, 2x Romanian Brewers Cup Champion at Kohi Roastery in Bangkok Collaboration is what guided our approach.  We were very fortunate and grateful that there was such an outpouring of support for the project. Throughout the entire development process, over 90 coffee experts from 30 countries volunteered their time to offer their ideas and test our prototypes (and of course copious amounts of coffee were consumed).Here are just some of the passionate coffee lovers who helped to bring the AVENSI glasses to life and make this new way of enjoying coffee possible! (For a bigger list of people we want to thank, see the section below called “by coffee lovers, for coffee lovers”)  Here are what some of them had to say about the AVENSI:   

  
  The AVENSI is a next generation coffee cup designed to maximize your coffee's taste, aroma, and flavor. A masterpiece in glass architecture that marries form and function, blending an interior scientific shape with a sleek exterior design. The unique anatomy features a single-wall top, fused with a double-wall base. This doesn’t only look aesthetically beautiful, it functionally allows you to appreciate your coffee’s full potential in a whole new wayBe the first to experience the world's first patent-pending, scientifically engineered coffee glass that will redefine your coffee ritual.  
 The AVENSI has the most unique design for a coffee cup you’ll ever use. Inspired by nature, the glass architecture has gentle facets of a hexagon, which represents freedom and flow. In between sips, cradle the facets in your hand as a daily reminder to appreciate the moment and the brew you’ve crafted.   Whether you prefer to savor the peaceful moment alone or enjoy sharing it with friends and family, the AVENSI coffee glasses will forever transform your coffee drinking experience.      With 15 hidden features, the AVENSI is more than just a beautifully designed glass.    Below we’ve highlighted 6 key features of the AVENSI that will redefine your coffee ritual.      Inspiring a revolution to change the way people appreciate coffee isn’t a small task—we knew we couldn’t do this alone. So we shared our ideas with the coffee community around the world and received an overwhelming outpouring of support.       Wine and spirit glasses are intentionally designed to alter variables that enhance your drinking experience. The most notable ones are: enhancing and amplifying aromas, directing liquid to specific locations of your mouth/tongue, speed and flow rate of liquid entering your mouth, and rate of aeration and oxidation which is controlled by the surface area exposed to air.   By adjusting different elements of the glass architecture, such as glass shape, wall curvature, thickness, lip flare, rim diameter, bowl-to-rim ratio, and the overall volume (to name a few) they have been able to create optimal shapes for their glasses to enhance different flavor properties for the best drinking experience.    We were surprised that although coffee is one of the most consumed drinks in the world (with some of the most beautifully diverse flavors of ANY drink) there hasn’t been innovation to create something that upgrades the coffee experience.We saw what was missing from coffee cups, and took inspiration from wine and spirit glasses to create something that has never been done in the coffee world.    The result? The AVENSI, a new generation of coffee cup.      AVENSI is the world’s first coffee cup that allows you to do something no other cup can, its unique shape allows you to turn coffee drinking from quick consumption to an immersive experience through swirling.  This unlocks 2 revolutionary flavor upgrades that will redefine how you taste and experience coffee: Unlock these two new flavor upgrades: (1) flavor amplification & (2) flavor exploration.Similar to wine and spirit glasses, swirling amplifies your coffee’s flavor through taste and aroma.   90% of what we perceive as flavor comes from our sense of smell. To design a coffee glass that enhances flavor, it had to enhance aroma.The AVENSI does this better than any other coffee cup.
 The shape of the glass maximizes the surface area of your coffee when you swirl. This simple action isn’t just fun, swirling aerates and oxidizes your coffee revealing a spectrum of dormant aromas and flavors hiding in your brew that are normally lost in an ordinary mug.The “Diffusion Chamber” captures the rich bouquet of aromas and delivers them to your mouth and nose.   The shape of the glass is optimized to direct the flow of coffee perfectly onto your tongue. Similar to high end wine and spirit glasses, the AVENSI also has an ultra thin rim, which is 60% thinner than ordinary coffee cups. This maximizes the flow of coffee onto your tongue, immersing your palate with rich flavors in every sip.  
 Each of the AVENSI Glasses (VIDA, SENTI, and ALTO) are also designed with unique rim architectures of different diameters and curvatures. Each shape was engineered and tested to direct the flow and spread of coffee onto specific areas of your tongue and palate, creating a unique tasting experience that will enhance your coffee’s flavor notes.  Pair each glass by following our recommend flavor and roast pairings, or experiment and explore your coffee’s hidden flavors by drinking the same coffee in each of the AVENSI glasses.  
  Flavor exploration is a special experience that most coffee drinkers haven’t yet had the chance to discover. It’s made possible by temperature control and temperature retention.Coffee is a very unique drink because it exhibits deliciously different flavor profiles at different temperatures. As your coffee cools, there’s a brief window of time at each temperature where you can experience those unique flavor notes. 
 In other words, at 65 degrees Celsius your coffee may taste like black tea and dark chocolate with hints of brown sugar, but at 45 degrees Celsius that same coffee may taste smooth and sweet, with hints of citrus and blueberry. But most people miss out on this experience. That’s because traditional mugs either cool your coffee too fast or keep it hot for too long. You have no control.The AVENSI does something no other cup can: it turns coffee drinking into an active experience by allowing you to control the temperature through swirling. While the hybrid thermal wall retains your desired drinking temperature for longer.This extends the window of time for the flavors you want to experience, and transforms a typical coffee drinking experience into an immersive ritual where you’ll enjoy discovering new flavors in every cup.  Watch the video below to learn more about how swirling your coffee with the AVENSI will allow you to unlock your coffee’s full potential and give you a completely new way to experience your coffee’s flavors. 
     As a coffee lover, you know the journey is just as important as the destination—and the AVENSI glasses will give you a whole new way to appreciate the entire adventure.  The AVENSI Ritual is four simple steps that reconnect you with your senses and allow you to fully immerse yourself in the beautiful experience of enjoying your coffee.  
After using the AVENSI glasses, you’ll find it hard to go back to your old way of drinking coffee. We can't wait for you to see, touch, smell, and taste the difference.  
    As we were developing the next generation of coffee glasses, we had our eyes set on creating the world’s best coffee cup. But made an interesting discovery along the way. Through all of our experiments between the various prototypes and iterations, there wasn’t just one glass that stood out as the ‘best’. There were 3 unique shapes that consistently emerged as top performers.  Below is a summary of all three of the AVENSI glasses and their unique flavor enhancing properties.        Like the AVENSI glasses, the Discovery Felt Coasters are inspired by the hexagon: one of nature’s most beautiful shapes. The design features a mesmerizing optical illusion that symbolizes the depth and complexity of coffee’s flavors. It’s a simple reminder to slow down and take a moment to appreciate your coffee—when we do this, there’s so much we can discover.    You know the journey is just as important as the destination.You’re drawn to discover new ways to stay ahead of the curve, and you always seem to find them.This what brought you to coffee.

Founded by 3 coffee loving friends, our mission is to change the way people perceive coffee: from quick consumption to an active experience.          With the AVENSI glassware line, the idea that you can interact with your coffee in a way that actually impacts the flavor is what we hope will encourage more and more coffee drinkers to enjoy and appreciate coffee in a way never before possible.          AVENSI to us means ‘an adventure of the senses’. For us, coffee is an everyday adventure–being able to slow down and appreciate the moment by exploring the diverse flavor notes of our coffee.

Cold brew has a longer extraction process which gives it a few advantages over your typical cup of coffee. For one, it tastes a lot smoother.

After discovering something so great, we couldn’t help but share it. You don’t need to be a professional barista to make your own cold brew. The Arctic is specifically designed to make brewing easy at home.So what is cold brew? It’s a way of brewing coffee in cold water rather than the traditional method of using hot water. Cold brew has a longer extraction process which gives it a few advantages over your typical cup of coffee. For one, it tastes a lot smoother. The familiar bite of hot brewed coffee is caused by fatty acids, which are left behind during the cold brewing process. This means it’s not only easier on your taste buds but on your stomach as well.After brewing coffee grounds in cold water for a set amount of time (more on the ideal schedule later) you’re left with a tasty cold brew.Your brew can be used as a base for many different drinks: hot, cold, iced, or in a shake! The versatility of cold brew is a true game-changer in how you consume your daily dose of coffee.Plus, with the Arctic, you can brew up an entire batch of cold brew at once to store in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. There are a million reasons to love cold brew coffee made by the Arctic. But for starters, here are the main benefits we think you should know about: 

 
The Arctic is incredibly easy to use. Here's our preferred cold brew method to get you started.Remember, you’re in control of the brewing process from start to finish! If you prefer stronger coffee, simply add more coffee grounds, use less water, or increase your brew time. The beans you choose will also determine how your brew turns out, so experiment to find out what makes your favorite coffee.  As part of your daily life, we knew the Arctic had to be designed with equal elements of function and form. What we came up with was something sleek, and simple to use, so you can easily add it into your everyday coffee routine.The carafe is made of 100% borosilicate glass and has a capacity of 50.7 oz (1.5L) to hold enough cold brew for 1-2 weeks. The Micron Filter is laser cut with tiny holes, 200 microns in diameter, to keep coffee grounds from leeching into your brew. Each feature was chosen to enhance the entire coffee-making process, from the simplicity of brewing to enjoying the smooth taste in every cup.  Your favorite cup of coffee should be as unique as you are. The choice is yours in how little or how much you want to customize! If you’re someone who is very particular about your coffee, you’re going to love making cold brew with the Arctic. From fine-tuning the brewing process itself to choosing which beverage to make with your finished cold brew, the Arctic makes it easy to experiment and find out what works best for you. The possibilities are nearly endless with the Arctic. One of the great benefits of the Arctic is how customizable each brew can be. For all you coffee connoisseurs out there, you’re able to control not just the bean type or roast level, but also the brew time and water-to-coffee ratio. This affects the taste, aroma, and caffeine level, so you’re in complete control to adjust these levels to your liking and make your ideal brew each time. If you prefer to keep things simple, find out what works for you and stick to it.  If you prefer stronger coffee, simply add more coffee grounds, use less water, or increase your brew time. The beans you choose will also determine how your brew turns out, so experiment to find out what makes your favorite coffee. Once you’ve made a batch of cold brew with the Arctic, you can use it as a base in a variety of coffee beverages. Not only can you serve it as hot coffee, over ice, or with cream or milk, but there are also plenty of ways to think outside the mug. Try it in a smoothie or milkshake, over ice cream, mixed with your favorite spirit, or even use it to bake with! Any coffee lover will surely have no shortage of creative ways to incorporate cold brew into drinks and desserts. Here’s a few of our favorite recipes:  The journey for developing the Arctic was a process that was driven by our love and passion for coffee. And, of course, it was fuelled by coffee, too. Our goal was simple: bring to life an awesome cold brew system we would be proud to use ourselves and share with our friends. We envisioned it would be functional and an attractive conversation piece. Take a closer look at our journey with the Arctic! The Arctic isn’t just a coffee maker—it’s going to be an integral part of your new lifestyle. If you’re like us, you need coffee in the morning and it needs to be well-made. Cold brew made with the Arctic simply tastes better than regular coffee: it’s smoother, more flavorful, and has less bite. The Arctic can save you money by avoiding those daily trips to the coffee shop, and save you time by brewing big batches at once that can last up to 2 weeks.  You’re going to love the versatility that the Arctic provides, which lets you adjust both the brewing process and your beverage of choice as well. Say hello to hot coffee, iced coffee, shakes, and anything else your imagination can dream up for cold brew. Best of all, the Arctic itself is a prime example of when beautiful design is masterfully executed. Because when all your guests compliment you on serving them the best coffee they’ve ever had, you’ll be proud to show them the Arctic.Your pledge will not only help us bring the Arctic to life, it will help us build our brand and take our business to the next level.

That’s StixFresh! Just peel and stick to fruit to reduce spoilage. It’s that easy! When faced with external and potentially harmful environmental factors, plants produce secondary metabolites to protect themselves. Naturally produced substances like alkaloids, steroids, fats, tannins and sugars help ward off pesky predators like insects, pathogens, or in some cases, even other invasive plant species. Some of these compounds activate and travel in their vapor-phase, effectively protecting a relatively large area.We created a patent-pending formulation from these substances and applied it to the non-sticky side of a sticker. In essence, StixFresh has re-purposed these compounds to provide fruit with a similar protective shield. Independent studies have shown StixFresh may inhibit bacterial growth, thus slowing down over-ripening. Additionally, treated fruits show increased sweetness and firmness, as well as higher moisture retention. A study by Dr. Phebe Ding compared the cellular structure of a mango with StixFresh (left) and one without (right). She concluded that “The sticker has reduced the disease incidence of fruits, which could indirectly prolong the shelf life of fruits.”For more, check out our FAQ's, or message us directly. Absolutely. StixFresh’s all-natural, chemical-free ingredients are food-grade and meet GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) requirements in accordance with the FDA.Also, standard migration tests concluded that none of the sticker’s substances migrate directly into fruit. That means StixFresh won’t discolor fruit or change its taste. Rather, it keeps it naturally sweet and delicious!  StixFresh has been recognized by these food and packaging publications: Check out what’s being said about StixFresh:              StixFresh stickers perform best when placed on avocados, apples, oranges, and mangoes. Every year, the average US household throws away $2,200 of food.* Fruits and vegetables make up ~ $500 of that loss.A 1-year supply of StixFresh is only $149.

We’re working with farmers to ensure StixFresh can save as many of their fruits as possible.   Globally, 45% of fruits and vegetables go to waste. No one product alone could ever topple such a massive problem. But with all-natural StixFresh, together we can peel and stick our way to great progress. With each and every sticker, you’re making a difference in the world, right from your own kitchen.  StixFresh won two awards at the World Food Innovation Awards, Best Sustainability Initiative and Best Packaging Technology. Beyond doing our part to reduce global food waste, we’re also helping reduce hunger right here in America by partnering with City Harvest. The organization started in 1982 when a group of New Yorkers found that the city had an abundance of excess food while many of its residents struggled to feed themselves and their families. Since then, City Harvest has supported nearly 1.2 million hungry New Yorkers. Now that’s a cause really worth sinking our teeth into. Once our campaign is fully funded, we’ll donate $1 for every 1000 StixFresh stickers purchased.The more StixFresh stickers you buy, the bigger the difference you’ll make. Reducing worldwide food waste while fighting hunger right here at home. That’s like killing two birds with one sticker.  We welcomed Dr. Patrick Van Dijck as our new Chief Scientific Officer earlier this year. A true thought-leader with more than 28 years’ experience in molecular microbiology, Dr. Van Dijck leads our R&D team in our mission to reduce food waste around the world.As our formula uses natural non-synthetic ingredients, inevitably there will be biological variability from batch to batch which could affect effectiveness and reliability. Currently, Dr. Van Dijck and team are developing a platform that will allow quantitative measure and control of our formulation’s effectiveness.                                Dr. Kanchan, who holds a PhD in Botany and Biochemistry, carries out comprehensive testing and validation of our formulation to optimize its effectiveness.  Learn ways to reduce in your kitchen by following these simple tips. We appreciate all your support, financial or otherwise. Your funding, your feedback, your likes and your shares will go a long way in helping us bring the amazing StixFresh technology to market. On behalf of the entire StixFresh team, thank you for sticking with us!",48.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Meadery Coming Soon!</h3>
<p>We're opening a meadery in Orlando! After years of developing mead recipes at home and spending the past year on the details of setting up a business, we're excited to be officially moving forward with plans to open Zymarium Meadery - Orlando's FIRST meadery - by the end of 2021.</p>
<h3>Who Is Zymarium?</h3>
<p>Zymarium Meadery is a collaboration between co-owners Joe Leigh and Ginger Leigh who are bringing together their individual and shared passions to showcase the art and science of making high quality, flavorful meads. Joe Leigh, who is Zymarium's master mead-maker, has developed over 85 unique and highly rated meads with over 30 medals and awards in mead making in the past 3 years, including 6 Mazer Cups, and was named one of the top 10 AMMA National Mead Makers of the year in 2018 and 2019. Ginger Leigh, who is known professionally as <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/synthestruct/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Synthestruct</a>, is a multisensory artist and experience designer whose large scale audio-visual works and interactive installations have been presented at venues around the world, and was voted Orlando's 'Best Visual Artist' (Orlando Weekly 2020) for her works throughout the city at Snap! Gallery, Immerse, Dazzling Nights, and the Orlando Science Center. </p>
<p>This delightful duo have been married for 10+ years and are excited to be joining forces professionally to create something truly unique...</p>
<h3>Our Meads</h3>
<p>Mead is the oldest fermented beverage and is made from honey, in contrast to wine which is fermented grapes, or beer which is fermented grains. Honey can have many dimensions of flavor, with millions of different varieties that vary by region and season. Mead has the ability to emulate any beer, wine, cider, cocktail, or even dessert, giving it more range than any other type of craft beverage. Meads can range from dry to sweet, refreshing to decadent, be still or carbonated, 4% to 24% ABV, and offer flavors from new to nostalgic. Mead improves with age, it’s gluten free, and it has as much terroir as wine, if not more, since we can blend honeys and fruits. When made with fruits, it gives the mead an additional depth and complexity, and when barrel-aged, the oak barrels impart flavors of vanilla, coconut, and spice. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>At Zymarium, we love exploring these endless possibilities and pushing both the art and science of making high quality, delicious meads. We focus on creating modern meads using the latest fermentation methods and honoring the long history and tradition that comes with the world's oldest fermented beverage.  </p>
<h3>The Experience </h3>
<p>Creating new experiences for all the senses is at the heart of Zymarium Meadery, both in how we craft our meads, and through our tasting room, which will be designed entirely by Synthestruct, who specializes in creating futuristic and immersive experiences that utilize the latest in creative technology. Our tasting room will embody this passion for sensory exploration as a space for guests to indulge in new experiences to pair with your favorite meads (or flight!) of choice. </p> <p>We will have 12 different taps for guests to try when they visit the meadery, spanning many different styles of mead, which will be constantly rotating with new flavors to explore!  There will be carbonated Session meads, which emulate craft beer styles and strength, pure honey meads (""Traditionals""), which have a wonderfully balanced semi-sweet profile to showcase Florida's incredible range of local honey flavors, and Imperial Meads, which are big and bold, letting you get lost in the flavors of honey, fruit, or other fun things like coconut, vanilla, or chocolate. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We will also have bottles available! Our limited bottle releases will focus on barrel-aged meads, and luxurious dessert style fruit meads that we make by using an obscene amount of fruit and honey, omitting water from their recipe to maximize the flavors of the ingredients. We will also offer 4 packs of our Session meads to take home, and for those who wish to try our meads outside of Florida, we are able to ship our bottles to most states! </p> <h3>How it all began…</h3>
<p>When Joe and Ginger made their first batch of mead in 2014, Joe had already tried literally thousands of craft beers from around the world and had experience with homebrewing a few beers of his own. Before they had met, Ginger had developed her own honey obsession and had been coveting different honeys from the places she traveled, and, alongside studying digital media in college, also began studying bees with the dream of one day becoming a beekeeper. Together they began seeking out meads to try, and in 2014 decided to celebrate Ginger's birthday by making their first mead together. It was a great introduction to the process of mead-making, and sparked what would later become a full-time passion.</p>
<p>Over the next few years they continued to seek out the best meads from around the world, and Joe became dedicated to studying the art and science of fermentation. With hundreds of pages of notes taken over years of research, Joe had set out to create the highest quality, complex, flavorful, balanced meads using modern fermentation methods, and a few experimental methods of his own. In 2017 Joe began making mead again and channeling all of that knowledge into making meads that embodied the qualities they had originally sought to produce. What started as a hobby quickly changed into an obsession, continuously learning and pushing each mead to be better than the last, with Ginger lending her expertise with ideas on new flavors to explore and valuable critique that would shape each mead's final profile.</p>
<p>By 2018 Joe was entering and winning every American Mead Makers Association (AMMA) competition and started to dream of opening a meadery to share this passion.  Together Joe and Ginger envisioned what the meadery could be, as a space to bring people together to try new things, experiment with new ideas, expand public knowledge about mead, honey, and the bees that create it, and become a destination that people in Orlando and visitors will love. </p>

Your generous donation will be helping purchase stainless steel fermenters, glycol chiller, bottle filler, corker, labeler, wine pumps, hoses, fruit press, barrel racks, and a bunch of other things needed to make delicious meads. </p>

<h3>The Adventure Ahead!</h3>
<p>We are currently in the process of selecting our location in Orlando and are looking for a 5,000 - 7,000 square foot facility that will be home to both our production space and our tasting room! With your valuable support, once our location is ready we will use the funds to purchase the necessary equipment needed to produce our meads. After we sign a lease on the new location we will be able to apply for our remaining licenses, and as soon as the production space is all set up, we can begin making mead at the new meadery! We've been working hard to get everything ready to open the meadery by the end of the year, but there are many moving parts that are outside of our control. In the event that there are unexpected delays, the grand opening of the tasting room may not be until the first quarter of next year, but we would still have the ability to sell our meads before the tasting room opens.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help!</h3>
<p>We deeply appreciate any support you are able to give! If you prefer to help out in other ways, sharing our campaign with your friends through the Idiegogo share tools, and getting the word out about the meadery is also a great way to help! </p>

By 2018 Joe was entering and winning every American Mead Makers Association (AMMA) competition and started to dream of opening a meadery to share this passion.  Together Joe and Ginger envisioned what the meadery could be, as a space to bring people together to try new things, experiment with new ideas, expand public knowledge about mead, honey, and the bees that create it, and become a destination that people in Orlando and visitors will love. 
 

What We Need & What You Get
We are looking to raise $40,000 or more so we can get everything we need to make you some amazing meads! Your generous donation will be helping purchase stainless steel fermenters, glycol chiller, bottle filler, corker, labeler, wine pumps, hoses, fruit press, barrel racks, and a bunch of other things needed to make delicious meads. 
 
THE PERKS!
•​Zymarium Sticker Pack ($5):
Includes not one...not two...but THREE different Zymarium stickers made from the highest quality weatherproof vinyl.

•Zymarium Corkscrew ($15):
This Coutale Sommelier corkscrew is completely bombproof and built on an unbreakable stainless steel frame. It features a manual double lever, and includes an automatic knife closure, a sharp micro-serrated knife, and a teflon-coated worm.
 
•Zymarium Founder's T-shirt of Tank Top ($40):
Limited edition Founder's shirts in your choice of style! The Unisex T-shirt is Bella Canvas 3001 and Tank is  Bella Canvas 6488 (in other words, super soft + great quality!). These shirts are printed using a special discharge printing technique which removes the shirt's color and replaces it with the printed color (instead of putting ink on top), so the print becomes part of the shirt and will never fade!

 
•Zymarium Founder's Glasses ""Home and Away"" Set (2 Glasses)($50):
This limited edition Founder's glassware set is available only to the OG Zymarium founders (that's you!) and includes the gold-printed founder's insignia on side 1, ""Zymarium Meadery Founder 2021"" on side 2, and gold rim. The set includes one 18.25oz Libbey Vina Diamond Balloon Mead Glass, and one 4.75oz Rastal Bugatti Goblet, perfect for home and away!

 
•Part of the Hive ($75):
Your name will become enshrined in the tasting room forever as one of our founders, to honor you for your generous donation. Everyone who sees it will know you helped build Zymarium! 
•Soft Opening Invite (+guest) ($100):
You and your guest will be among the first people ever to experience Zymarium and try our meads! Join us for an exclusive soft opening night before the crowds at the grand opening. This perk includes a drink ticket at the event for each of you!
•First In Line For Membership ($100):
Invitations to join the membership will be chosen at random from a long waiting list, but this perk would guarantee you an invitation to join! Since all six of the exclusive club bottles will be barrel-aged, we have a very limited number of spots in the membership and members will have first right of renewal, so the 'First In Line' perk is a way of guaranteeing your spot so you don't miss out on the membership opportunity. This perk does not include or discount the cost of the club membership ($450+taxes&fees).
The club membership will include:

Six exclusive barrel-aged meads (4 of which are Multi-Berry Endless Meads)
First access to public release bottles
The option to add a proxy, or ship to your state if possible
Special glassware, tasting room discount, first right of renewal, first access to events, etc

•VIP Tasting + Tour (+3 guests)($400):
You and three guests will get a private tour and tasting with the owners! The tasting will include some very special selections unavailable to the public. We’ll schedule a time that works best for everyone, on a night the meadery is closed to the public (Mon-Thurs).
•Make a Session Mead ($1,000):
We will consult with you on the development of a new mead recipe that will be tailored to your personal tastes. You will also assist in the naming of the mead and your name will always be included in the description on the menu and/or label!
•Name a Honey Fermenter ($1,500):
With this perk you'll be directly helping us to purchase the special fermenters to create our traditional meads which celebrate Florida's local honeys! Your name will be prominently displayed on the tank as a thank you for helping build the meadery! If you don’t want to use your name, you can name it after your pet, your band, or dedicate it to a loved one! 
This also includes two very special lifetime perks!

Every year for your birthday, come in that week and celebrate with a $50 tab on us!
Every time we are going to do a public bottle release, you will have the ability to purchase it before anyone else! All of our bottles will be very limited, so this would ensure you never miss out on a mead you want. You also won't have to wait in line or deal with timed online releases. All purchased bottles will be held until you (or a proxy) pick them up, or if you want them shipped (and we can ship to your state, see the FAQ), we will be happy to hold your bottles until you have a full box.

 
•Name a Large Fermenter ($5,000):
With this perk you'll be directly helping us to purchase our session mead tanks! Your name will be prominently displayed on the tank as a thank you for helping build the meadery! If you don’t want to use your name, you can name it after your pet, your band, or dedicate it to a loved one! 
This also includes two very special lifetime perks!

Every year for your birthday, come in that week and celebrate with a $75 tab on us!

All of our bottles will be very limited, so this would ensure you never miss out on a mead you want. You also won't have to wait in line or deal with timed online releases.

If you don’t want to use your name, you can name it after your pet, your band, or dedicate it to a loved one! 
This  also includes THREE very special lifetime perks! 

Anytime you come into the meadery, your first pour is on us (one pour per day)!

The Adventure Ahead!
We are currently in the process of selecting our location in Orlando and are looking for a 5,000 - 7,000 square foot facility that will be home to both our production space and our tasting room! With your valuable support, once our location is ready we will use the funds to purchase the necessary equipment needed to produce our meads. After we sign a lease on the new location we will be able to apply for our remaining licenses, and as soon as the production space is all set up, we can begin making mead at the new meadery! We've been working hard to get everything ready to open the meadery by the end of the year, but there are many moving parts that are outside of our control. In the event that there are unexpected delays, the grand opening of the tasting room may not be until the first quarter of next year, but we would still have the ability to sell our meads before the tasting room opens.
 

Other Ways You Can Help!
We deeply appreciate any support you are able to give! If you prefer to help out in other ways, sharing our campaign with your friends through the Idiegogo share tools, and getting the word out about the meadery is also a great way to help!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>New York…The Empire State…Home to 20 million people and a thriving craft beverage community that is supported by our State’s vast agricultural resources. We’re a diverse state, with tastes as varied as our residents. We love our salt potatoes and riggies, our plates and our wings. We boast no fewer than 9 different hot dog manufacturers that someone will claim is “the best.” We have a lot to celebrate…and it was in that spirit that Nine Spot Brewing was formed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nine Spot Brewing, coming soon to Rochester, NY, is a brewery and taproom that takes all of its inspirations from this incredible state that we call home. Built on the truest intentions of the New York Farm Brewing Initiative, we source the majority of our ingredients from local producers. When you walk in, you’ll have the ability to sample not only our great beers, but guest taps and pours that we’ve scoured the state to find.</p>

<p>The concept of Nine Spot Brewing is a culmination of Marina Christopher’s 20-year career in the craft beverage industry. In 2017, her concept found the shared ideals of Chris Nothnagle, Gary Rodriguez, and Edd Taylor, who came from the world of sales and planning craft beer events. This group of friends worked tirelessly to get Nine Spot off the ground until tragedy hit in 2019 when we lost our head brewer, founder, and friend Edd. An unimaginable loss, but we tried to carry on in his spirit. 3 months later, (now engaged) Marina and Chris lost their home in a devastating fire...just weeks before their wedding. We don’t need to remind anyone what 2020 brought us. But time in hibernation gave us an opportunity. We welcomed longtime friend, and financial guru, Bill Merkle to the Nine Spot family. We used quarantine and multiple furloughs to fine tune our recipes and plans. We waited…until the time was right again, and THAT’S what brings us to today.</p>

<p>With the help of too many people to list, Nine Spot Brewing was reborn, and ready to make up for lost time. We’re excited to share our core lineup. Beers like Stuyvesant Ale. A hop forward pale named for the Governor who handed New Amsterdam over to the British. And Unique New York, a wheat beer made with exotic hibiscus, lime, and regional honey that was originally brewed for International Women in Brewing Day. Each of our recipes captures the spirit of New York from bine to barrel. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nine Spot is more than just a craft brewery. We found an incredible location, rich with city history, and smack dab in the middle of a growing craft beer mecca. We’re building our brewing facilities and kitchen with a focus on energy and water conservation. We’ve made a commitment to be a benchmark employer that advances diversity in our industry, and also one that offers benefits and wages that set a “new normal” in craft beer. There are less expensive ways to get a brewery off the ground, but we’ve all worked within the “status quo” for long enough.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That’s where you come in…We are launching a crowdfund campaign through Indiegogo. The funds raised through this campaign will go directly to help restore our location, originally built in 1940, back to its architectural splendor. It also will allow us to upgrade our proposed brewing system. This upgraded 5-barrel brewhouse will allow us to brew more New York inspired goodness, more often. Support levels start as low as $10. We are offering so many great rewards to accompany your support level. Everything from drink tokens and stickers all the way up to sponsoring a fermenter or the opportunity to tell your New York Story by having a beer named after you.</p>

While most beer brewing machines have their body, kegs, and some variable components that require a steep learning curve to be mastered, it combines both the ""Brewing Tank"" and the ""Fermentation Tank"" into one unique, structurally advanced body.

Fully customizable and community-integrated, it will change the way you both brew and experience beer for the rest of your life! 
 
 

   

 

 

  

 
Turn on and grab a pre-created Brewing Pack , water, and yeast.
   
Using the LCD screen, select the type of beer you would like to brew from our built-in recipe library - or - create your own recipe through our App.
 

 
Open the panels on top of it and pull out the lids to expose the MiniKegs where you will pour your ingredients. Following the LCD screen’s instructions, pour in the correct amount of water (typically around 6L) and put the correct amount of ingredients.
 
Every ingredient has a dedicated container/compartment.
 

 
Press ""Start"" and it will automatically boil your malts, mix in the hops, add in the yeast, and ferment for 1 to 3 weeks. Then - enjoy!

 
 

Our goal has always been to create a one-stop-shop where craft beer enthusiasts can simply and effortlessly brew amazing tasting beers without having to be a master brewer. While most beer brewing machines have their body, kegs, and some variable components that require a steep learning curve to be mastered, it combines both the ""Brewing Tank"" and the ""Fermentation Tank"" into one unique, structurally advanced body. Through the LCD screen, mashing tank window, and the app, you can easily program, monitor, and create a brick-and-mortar brewing experience in your very own kitchen!
 

   
With the the library of built-in recipes at your fingertips, you’ll be able to create Pilsners, IPAs, Porters, Weizens, Lagers, Stouts, and heck - you can even brew a batch of Blueberry Beer! All ingredients will be sourced from the best certified US suppliers.   You’ll have a variety of customizable combinations that have been curated by our Master Brewer - Aobo Sun - who is a certified sommelier from the Doemens College of Beer in Germany. We will continue to add new recipes to the library which will be automatically updated through your wifi connections, so if it’s not there today, you can bet it’ll be there soon! 

 
 

Outfitted with state-of-the-art sensors, it allows for maximum control and feedback with minimal brewing experience and attention. You can monitor the brew time, brew phase, temperature, and - for the advanced users - you can even monitor the Saccharify Curve. The user interface is intuitive and easy-to-use with sliding scales for variables such as alcohol content, bitterness, flavor profile and more!

<h3>Hard Seltzer 101</h3>
<p><strong>A step-by-step to making the perfect hard seltzer using the uKeg TWIST.</strong></p>
<p><strong>STEP 1: Add ingredients</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>unthread the Seltzer Cap and add ice</li>
<li>add one cap full of uKeg TWIST flavoring (1.5 cap-full for 36 oz TWIST) OR, add fresh fruit to taste</li>
<li>add cold water to the 'FILL LINE""</li>
<li>re-install the Seltzer Cap</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>STEP: 2 Carbonate</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>remove the Easy Twist Regulator</li>
<li>insert a new 8 gram CO2 cartridge into the Cartridge Well (small end pointing up).</li>
<li>re-install the Easy Twist Regulator until fully tight (you may hear a gas ""rushing"" sound (this is normal)</li>
<li>shake the TWIST for 30 seconds</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>STEP 3: Enjoy!</strong></p>
<p>Rotate the SPOUT out fully. Either pour using the DISPENSE BUTTON or sip directly through the SPOUT (you do not need to push the DISPENSE BUTTON to sip through the SPOUT)</p>

re-install the Seltzer Cap

STEP: 2 Carbonate

remove the Easy Twist Regulator

You also were never able to use your tumbler to drink your favorite beverage directly from the bottle, can, or skinny canwithout it going warm. That ends TODAY!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>THE PROBLEM:</p>
<p>You know the pains of warm beer, soda, or whatever else you drink. So well, that you tell yourself you like the taste. No, you've probably never said that. Sure, you could buy a $35beer insulator, a $25 can insulator, another $20 can insulator because you want to try those fancy skinny cans, and not to mention the $30 tumbler you already own to pour liquid into. That's a costly $110 just because they want to sell you more! More! More!</p>

With fromaggio, you can ensure your cheese is more authentic, natural and healthier than store bought cheese. When you try homemade cheese made with fromaggio, you might be tasting real cheese for the first time! *latest version shown in image below
 
  

  
 Fromaggio makes almost any type of soft or hard cheese (and healthy yogurts too!) — cream cheese, chevre, ricotta, cottage, mozzarella, parmesan, camembert, comté, cheddar, bleu, colby, provolone, keffir, kosher, lactose-free, or even vegan cheese. With fromaggio, you can create your own unique cheese recipes and save or share them in the app. Many cheeses are enjoyed fresh, or users can remove the cheese and then age it if they desire.  You’ll love the efficiency and convenience of fromaggio. Making cheese at home will now be simple and nearly effortless — forget all the accessories and labor that at-home cheesemakers of the past required.An LCD touch screen display walks you through a few easy steps, and then fromaggio does the rest. Fromaggio also connects to a mobile app, via Bluetooth connectivity, where you can control the machine, read instructions, order ingredients, customize and share recipes, and more.Fromaggio has detachable heads that feature different size cutters, and even a press, to help create your perfect cheese. Additionally, fromaggio has a removable whey container. Whey is a healthy byproduct of cheesemaking that has many uses, from making ricotta cheese, to fertilizing your garden to preparing a protein shake.  With a removable, dishwasher-safe drainer, various size detachable curd cutters, and a press, fromaggio is extremely easy to sanitize, maintain and re-use.  
Mesophilic cultures can make a variety of moderate temperature, hard cheeses including cheddar, colby, gouda, monterey jack, muenster, blue, and stilton. It can also make a variety of semi-ripened and fresh cheese including camembert, brie, gouda, edam, blue, feta, and havarti.Thermophilic cultures can make a variety of high temperature cheeses including mozzarella, provolone, swiss, romano, gruyere, and parmesan. 
After living in Paris for 15 years, Glen returned to the U.S. and was surprised to find people were still eating the same, tasteless, artificial, grocery store cheese. He gathered a team of innovators and foodies — from the director of partnerships at YouTube to the head cheesemaker at a dairy farm, Fromaggio is a team of engineers, designers and cheese experts. We have lined up the best manufacturers, suppliers and engineers we could find. Together, we are on a mission to bring affordable, artisanal quality cheese to kitchen countertops worldwide.

ProntoBev uses patent pending technology to chill an entire bottle to a specific temperature in just 30 seconds or less.   So whether you forgot to chill that special bottle, just got a new one, or prefer your drink chilled at a certain temperature, ProntoBev is here.  ProntoBev is the fastest way to rapidly chill your warm beverages to refrigerator cold. In 30 seconds, it can can bring the temperature of the your drinks down by 20 degrees Fahrenheit in 30 seconds! That’s 40x faster than putting it in the freezer!Save refrigerator space and get your beverages cold when you want them. Instantly chill wine, coffee, tea, liquor, juice, water, or just about anything!  ProntoBev’s interior is constructed with wine-grade stainless steel, the same material used in the winemaking process so it won’t affect taste or quality.And our ProntoGel is so powerful, it can chill your drink to sub-freezing temperatures! ProntoBev can bring the temperature of the your drinks 40x faster than putting it in the freezer! ProntoBev can chill your drinks to below freezing temperatures!**Chilling a drink to below freezing temperatures will null the taste of your drink. But if desired, ProntoBev will take a few minutes to bring drink to below freezing temperatures. ProntoBev can hold 750ml of liquid, that’s a whole bottle of wine! ProntoBev can be used multiple times before returning to the freezer.**The first bottle should take about 30 seconds. Additional bottle may take slightly longer, but still way faster than a fridge or freezer Use the built-in thermometer to know when your beverage is perfectWine-grade stainless steel means taste is kept pure and unaffected.   We wanted to perfect every part of the wine experience. That's why we also made ProntoAer, the world’s fastest aerator. which fits seamlessly on your ProntoBev or any glass.  No more backlog on your pour, spilled drinks, or large decanters. Use it for any occasion to improve the taste, aroma, and overall enjoyment of your wine drinking experience.  Sometimes a single glass is all you need and other times, you want to enjoy the entire bottle.  ProntoAer works comfortably on top of a variety of glasses, so you can aerate and enjoy as much or as little wine that you want.        You don't have to be a sommelier to understand the importance of serving wine at the right temperature. Chill an entire bottle of wine in 30 seconds! So whether you forgot to chill that special bottle, just got a new one, or prefer wine at its intended temperature, ProntoBev is here.    Love iced coffee? So do we. With ProntoBev, you don’t have to wait and water down your coffee. Chill your whole batch instantly so you can have a refreshing wake-me-up immediately in the morning.  Iced tea is a refreshing summertime drink that takes a bit of time to prepare and let cool. Brew your tea the usual way and throw it in ProntoBev chilling it quickly creating instant ice tea that everyone can enjoy.   Watery, ice-cold whiskey is difficult to enjoy, which is why we avoid using ice in our whiskey. Quality whiskey is determined in tasting its unique characteristics. Ice diminishes the fragrance and dilutes the taste. ProntoBev allows you to chill your whiskey without destroying what makes it great.  Sweet, sweet vodka can sometimes not be so sweet. ProntoBev will quickly chill your vodka to an enjoyable temperature that can completely nullify the taste of alcohol. No more waiting by the freezer to get the party going!

 

 



The prototype in this demonstration had some issues with the built-in thermometer. So we decided to show you the temperature difference with an external thermometer.

<p>We are Rosemary Wilson and Joseph Perez and we are the co-owners of Flower Coffee Collective, a mobile purveyor of specialty coffee in the Long Branch community.</p>
<p>The vibrant Long Branch business district is full of diverse and interesting options. One thing we knew it was lacking was a specialty coffee shop: a space to get high quality brews and espresso, &amp; for the community to gather.  As local residents invested in our community, we were really inspired by all the work that was being done between local businesses and neighbors to get through Covid and quarantine together. We saw a place for coffee and community and we began building Flower Coffee Collective. While a brick and mortar seemed a bit tricky at a time when the country was only beginning to consider vaccines and reopening plans, we decided to shift to a mobile format. We quickly realized that this business model would also enable us to create relationships and partnerships, which was one of our biggest goals. Throughout the past few months we have learned so much about the Long Branch businesses and the services and collaboration Montgomery County and Montgomery Housing Partnership provides. We have met so many local community leaders and been connected to many resources. We are so thankful and amazed. </p>

It's the most convenient and affordable way to open, pour, and preserve wine. 
 
 

 An Easy to Use Foil Cutter 
 Simply remove foil by placing the cutter on the top of the bottle and squeezing it while turning. Lift the cutter away and the foil comes off, leaving the cork exposed. Conveniently Open Wine In One-click 
 Unlike other manual wine openers, the electric Vinotok wine opener set saves time and effort. It removes the cork in 7 seconds with one click and won't break the cork or chip the wine bottle. Open your wine with ease, every time. Decanting The Wine In 30 Seconds 
 Leaving a wine bottle open to the air reduces the tannins & astringency to make wine taste smoother. Now, with Vinotok, there is no need to wait for hours to decant the wine. The built-in aerator device adds oxygen that interacts with the wine quickly, to speed up the oxidation process. Unlike other wine sets that lack this feature, Vinotok allows you to perfectly optimize flavors & aromas in just 30 seconds and make the wine taste better. Pour Easily Without Wasting A Single Drop 
 Vinotok’s specially designed pourer lets you pour perfectly and drip-free to avoid messy mistakes for proper presentation. It allows you to serve the wine quickly, is easy to clean, and is suitable for all kinds of wine bottles. Preserve The Delicate Taste Of Your Wine 
 Vinotok’s vacuum wine stopper replaces the cork and slows down the oxidation process to maintain the freshness and taste of opened wine for up to 7 days. The vacuum function of Vinotok helps to preserve your wine by removing air from the open bottle to preserve quality. This wine stopper also features a timer, which allows you to keep track of how long your wine has been opened. 
 With contemporary stylish looks, long-lasting durability, and user-friendly design, Vinotok makes a useful accessory for home, restaurant, or bar use. The Vinotok 3 in 1 wine tool makes a great gift for family, friends, or to treat yourself.   
 Vinotok is conveniently rechargeable with an onboard battery. With each charge, Vinotok can be used up to 40 times.",34.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Thus the name SEND  A SEED.Then use the remaining as seeds and some as for food and extra for sale to get income for other basic needs.20 kilograms of seeds yield approximately 100 kilogrammes on harvesting.Bean seeds cost Uganda Shs 3000/- per kilogram while Maize seeds cost Uganda Shs 2000/- per kilogram20 Kgs of Bean seeds cost U Shs 60,000/- while 20 Kgs Maize seeds cost 40,000/- .Totaling to U Shillings 100,000/- (One hundred thousands)This is the cost of seeds for each woman.There are already 20 members in the project.We would like to increase the members with the seeds to at least 40To provide such an amount to at least 40 women peasants;40x 100,000/- = 4,000,000/= (Uganda Shillings four millions)Equivalent to British Pound Sterling 800.So we are appealing to you to contribute to this fundraising to enable the project be a success.You will also get perks for backing our campaign as indicated on the campaign page.Contribute to the campaign using the BACK IT Button on the campaign page.HOPE KEMIREMBEContact me: hopekemirembe4@gmail.comNOTE THAT: This campaign ended.Contact us through the above email.THANK YOU.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>An easy-to-use, easy-to-clean lid that lets people serve food from aluminum foil pans that’s eco-friendly and keeps bugs, fingers, and germs out of the food. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;font-size:45px;"">Hi Everyone!<strong> </strong>Here is my story of QuikLid.</p>
<p>I threw a birthday party for my brother with lots of family and friends.  I cooked enough food for a small army, set up the serving table, then let them know <strong>“It's time to dig in""</strong>.</p>

<p>I watched food dripping onto the table, foil and plastic wrap coverings pushed into the food, food getting on people’s hands, and saw children dipping their dirty hands into the food.

<p>QuikLid is the perfect reusable lid for aluminum pans.  It fits snuggly over the pan and is held in place by flanges on each side. You see the food inside, serve from either side, and you can keep the lid open making it easy to serve food while holding a plate or a glass. We made the QuikLid from thick polycarbonate to help keep foods hot or cold, so the first serving is as good as the last serving.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627151384/p3sgfc5otjn6lebst6aj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>When the serving starts and lots of people are lined up, you can position the lid to stay open so it’s easy to serve while holding a plate in your other hand.</p>

<p>Since QuikLid's are rigid, they don’t dip into the food and you can stack multiple pans on top of each other for easy transport.</p>

<p>When the party is over, take the leftovers by just closing the lid – no fighting with crinkled, dirty foil or stuck-to-it-self plastic wrap.</p>

<p> QuikLid can go in the fridge and the oven (up to 230°), so you don’t have to use any disposable coverings on food that is prepared ahead and kept cold or while it’s warming before serving. QuikLid can go directly from the refrigerator to a warm oven, no problem.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Hello everyone, my name is Eileen Payan. I am an Arizona native, enthusiastic about all things food, and founder and owner of Por Vida Bakery. Por Vida is in collaboration with Palabras Bilingual Bookstore to bring the community a unique experience of Latin culture and art in literature and baked goods.</p>
<p><strong>Mission: </strong>To provide Latinx pastries by utilizing local, organic, and high quality ingredients to lend a sense of nostalgia and excitement in every bite. In turn, help my community with resources due to I.C.E. and deportation, and help young adults become entrepreneurs so they too can help their community.</p>
<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>
<p> I am a self taught baker with 10+ years of kitchen experience. I have such a passion for all things food. I have worked in every type of kitchen setting. This is my life, for life, POR VIDA!!</p>
<p>In August 2014, my family's life changed forever. In front of my neighbors, in front of my child and myself, we witnessed the abduction of my husband by I.C.E. I froze. I was scared for my husband and worried for my 5 year old child. I didn't know who to call, what to do, nor did I have the financial resources to hire a lawyer. I felt helpless and alone. Six years later, this topic still hurts and upsets me. I always wished I knew of some sort of organization or outlet that could have provided help, group sessions, financial resources such as fundraising opportunities due to income being cut in half. I didn't know of any. I felt clueless. One day in 2019 at Palabras Bilingual Bookstore, I shared my story in front of a group of people. As painful as it was to conjure up these feelings, it felt good to let it out. This sparked something in me. I knew it that moment that my experiences could be a source of solace to others. I just didn't know how to go about it. A few months later, Chawa, the owner of Palabras Bilingual Bookstore, spoke with me and told me how much she's enjoyed my pastries and that my story inspired her and she wanted to help. That was the birth of <strong>Por Vida Bakery</strong>. I believe, through my own personal experience, providing a space for people to share their story while eating pastries baked with love will be therapeutic. I want others impacted the way my family was to know that they are not alone and they have support.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Currently, I am working in the bakery department for another company. This is my ""bread and butter"" if you will. This income is to sustain my family's well-being and I intend to remain employed there as long as it makes sense for me and my family. In regards to Por Vida Bakery, I have acquired my proper licenses, secured a kitchen space, and we (Chawa and I) have obtained a beautiful space coming soon in the Central/Downtown Phoenix area. With your help, I will be able to buy what I need for Por Vida to expand and grow my business. In order to do that, I need to raise $13,500 for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Register System</li>
<li>New Oven</li>
<li>2x Refrigerator (One for Kitchen, One for Retail Space)</li>
<li>Large Freezer</li>
<li>Display Case</li>
<li>Toaster Oven</li>
<li>6 Months rent and utilities for kitchen space and for shared space with Palabras</li>
<li>Other things to be functional such as ingredients, cups, napkins, etc.</li>
<li>Additional amount to cover campaign promotion and Indiegogo fees (.03 for each credit card processed and 5% of funds raised)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Perks</strong></p>
<p>As a thank you for your support, I am offering some ""sweet"" deals including recipes, ""How To"" videos on how to make some of my favorite pastries, shirt with "" Por Vida"" logo, Por Vida membership with 10% off, and much more!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By supporting Por Vida Bakery, you are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supporting the success of a Latina owned business</li>
<li>Helping Por Vida support the community affected by I.C.E. and Deportation</li>
<li>Teach young adults to be entrepreneurs so they can help their community</li>
<li>Increase awareness of our culture and give children more of an opportunity to see themselves in books they read from Palabras Bilingual Bookstore because of our collaboration</li>
<li>Create a safe space to help those share their most vulnerable moment </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Right now , I find that I am not able to bake at my full potential capacity. I am currently obligated to working two jobs to support my family. By baking a mass quantity, I will be able to bake for Por Vida/Palabras, Farmers Market, and consignment for two locations that I've secured, in addition to future consignments.</p>
<p>The oven I work with now causes me to work double and I encounter constant glitches. In my experience, working in a professional kitchen for so long, I know that I have potential to work more efficiently with more quality appliances.</p>
<p>In regards to baking, everything has to be timed exactly. With a quality oven, my time will be used to its maximum capacity which will allow me to work more efficiently for my business and customers. The extra free time will be appreciated because I can spend it with my family.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Your donations will support me in purchasing the remaining items needed to launch Por Vida Bakery. If you are not in position to support with a monetary donation, please know that sharing this with your network would be invaluable to me and greatly appreciated.</p>
</div><p>Thank you from the bottom of my heart</p><p>Por Vida Bakery's founder and owner,</p><p>Eileen Payan</p></div>","Overview

As a thank you for your support, I am offering some ""sweet"" deals including recipes, ""How To"" videos on how to make some of my favorite pastries, shirt with "" Por Vida"" logo, Por Vida membership with 10% off, and much more!

The Impact
By supporting Por Vida Bakery, you are:

Supporting the success of a Latina owned business
Helping Por Vida support the community affected by I.C.E. and Deportation
Teach young adults to be entrepreneurs so they can help their community
Increase awareness of our culture and give children more of an opportunity to see themselves in books they read from Palabras Bilingual Bookstore because of our collaboration
Create a safe space to help those share their most vulnerable moment 


Risks & Challenges
Right now , I find that I am not able to bake at my full potential capacity. I am currently obligated to working two jobs to support my family. By baking a mass quantity, I will be able to bake for Por Vida/Palabras, Farmers Market, and consignment for two locations that I've secured, in addition to future consignments.
The oven I work with now causes me to work double and I encounter constant glitches. In my experience, working in a professional kitchen for so long, I know that I have potential to work more efficiently with more quality appliances.
In regards to baking, everything has to be timed exactly. With a quality oven, my time will be used to its maximum capacity which will allow me to work more efficiently for my business and customers. The extra free time will be appreciated because I can spend it with my family.

Other Ways You Can Help
Your donations will support me in purchasing the remaining items needed to launch Por Vida Bakery. If you are not in position to support with a monetary donation, please know that sharing this with your network would be invaluable to me and greatly appreciated.

We make Serpiente in the heart of town where the now world famous spirit got its start, Tequila. Then we bottle it in mouth blown, crystal glass bottles handmade by skilled glass artisans. Due to our manufacturing process, no two bottles are exactly the same. Each bottle is unique, just like our consumers. Visiting The Blue Agave Fields In Los Altos, Jalisco We use a meticulously selected group of 100% Weber Blue Agave sourced directly from the valleys of Jalisco to make our tequila. We work with local Mexican farmers who grow and cultivate the blue agave for years until they reach maturity. With each bottle purchased, you will be helping to support the local economy in Jalisco and family owned businesses.  We utilize traditional slow baking, brick ovens and autoclaves to cook the blue agave hearts, and traditional molinos to extract the juices from the agave plant. We then wash the agave fibers with naturally refined water. Fermentation can take up to 50+ hours which gives us a more full bodied tequila/agave flavor. The final step is our single batch, double distillation process which leaves us with our amazing tasting Serpiente Ultra Premium Tequila Plata profile.   Our Reposado & Añejo profiles are aged in American Oak Whiskey Barrels, for up to 8 months and 12 months, respectively.

<h3>What's Happening at the Lightbox Cafe</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Gaby and Jen are service industry veterans on a mission to do something that's never been done. Amidst the drunken debauchery of cheesesteak alley, we're seeking to open an oasis of goodness and bliss. Lightbox Cafe will provide plant-powered food and drink without pretension within a day-to-night space for music, art, and conversation. Expect drag on Sunday afternoons, midday dance parties on a weekday and a booze-free bar scene of herbal elixirs.  Enjoy a shell of kava kava while locals share poetry. Sip tea with a vegan treat. Lightbox Cafe will be a container for brilliant incidences of community connection. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We’ve invested $80,000 of our own funds and nearly a year of our lives hand-crafting PA’s first kava kava lounge, cold-pressed juicery, and plant-based cafe in the heart of Queen Village. We are a few short weeks away from opening our doors, and we need your help to help us push through our final funding hurdles to make it all manifest!</p>

<p>We're Treetop - a team of Texans turned Tennesseean with a passion for great coffee and families affected by foster care and adoption. You can also call us Rachel and Courtney! For the last two years we've been driving around East Tennessee in our big green coffee truck serving at weddings, birthday parties, office gatherings, teacher appreciation celebrations - you get the gist. Behind the scenes, we partner with all kinds of organizations supporting children and families involved in adoption and foster care. In the past, this has looked like anything from monetary donation, to book and school supply drives, to adoption fundraising.</p>
<p>Two years after starting a mobile coffee shop, we find ourselves with an opportunity to add a brick and mortar shop to our current operations- crazy, we know. While a stand alone shop has always been a goal of ours, we didn't realize we'd be in a position to reach that goal this early in Treetop's journey, especially after a year full of challenges and surprises. We're FLOORED by the response of people in our immediate community and elsewhere, and are so excited to bring this shop to life! </p>
<h3>How we got here and Where we're headed</h3>
<p>We say this often and earnestly - Treetop would not be in this position if not for the rallying of a community that has welcomed and invited us into the Knoxville coffee scene. From day one you've bought our coffee, said hello at the food truck park, invited us to your parties, and kept us afloat during a pandemic shutdown. We'll never get over the consistent generosity and cheerleading from you all, and it's why we're confident this shop will be a beautiful addition to Treetop with your help.</p>
<p><strong>Immediate Impact: </strong>This shop is for you! We'll be in an area that is seriously underserved when it comes to great coffee. Aside from that, though, we want to create a space that encourages people to gather, engage with, and enjoy their community. Your contribution helps you just as much as it helps us! </p>
<p><strong>Broader Impact: </strong>As Treetop continues to grow, so does our reach. The addition of a brick and mortar opens another source of revenue, allowing us to invest more in our partner organizations locally and internationally - the cause behind the coffee is a huge part of why we do this.</p>

<p>The game plan is to reach this number through small business lending, crowdfunding, and private investment. If you're interested in what a private investment would look like with Treetop, we'd love to hear from you. If crowdfunding is more your jam, we've got perks for you! </p>
<p><strong>What are perks? </strong>This platform is great for recognizing those that choose to give - and you deserve allll of the recognition. Throughout the duration of this campaign, we'll have different levels of perks depending on how much you're willing to give.

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>We’re Aaron &amp; Ryley (and Judah &amp; Aydan), and we’re very excited to share <strong>sunday coffee project </strong>(@sundaycoffeeproject) with you!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628801896/kyooxa83rnyjlifbl7wc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Sunday is our favorite day as a family. It always has been. Sundays look different for us seasonally, but the reason it’s become so special to our family is because it’s the day that we have no agenda. We hang out, we drink coffee, sometimes we get out and explore, but really it’s the day that we get to just be together.</p>

<p>Grocery Store Presence - not only ready to drink beverages, but also our classic retail offerings.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We’re aiming for $10,000 to help us cover initial startup costs and set us up to be in a solid position to begin sourcing some exciting coffees.</p>
<p>These funds will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business licensing</li>
<li>Branding, Packaging, and Website design (if you’ve seen what we already have going - get excited, because there are many more cool things in the pipeline)</li>
<li>Sourcing Coffee</li>
<li>Administrative fees (website, services/software, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Rewards</h3>
<p>One of the most exciting parts of running this campaign is getting some fun stuff into your hands! Each reward tier will come with coffee (of course). Most will come with a mug(s). Some will even come with a fun shirt we’re designing. But there’s one thing in particular that we’re really pumped about:</p>
<p>Starting at our <strong>$100</strong> reward tier, and all higher tiers, you’ll receive an invite to our launch party. We’re hosting a celebration here in Portland. We’ll have DJs providing the vibes, drinks and food will be on us, and you’ll have early-bird access to special coffees and merch. It’ll be a great time to celebrate the launch of the brand but also to celebrate all of <strong>YOU</strong> who have partnered with us to make this possible. So if you’re willing and able, we highly encourage you to join us for that!  </p>
<p>*If you’re not local and able to join us for the launch party in person, we’ll be adding extra goodies when we send your reward :)</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Every business takes on risk as they launch. In our opinion, our biggest risk is slow growth. However, we believe we are in a good position to minimize the impact of this risk for a couple reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>We don’t have a physical storefront. While this comes with some disadvantages, it drastically reduces the amount of startup capital needed and our monthly expenses. It gives us more financial flexibility and time to establish our customer base if we do grow slower than anticipated.</li>
<li>Aaron has worked in the coffee industry long enough to form a strong and supportive network that will be very beneficial in establishing customers and wholesale clients as we launch.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Getting this project off the ground is so much more than just monetary contributions. The biggest thing you can do for us is to engage with what we’re doing. And if you’ve read this far, you’re doing exactly that. Some practical ways you can help us get established and grow are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share this link on your social media platforms or with anyone you feel might be interested</li>
<li>Follow us on social media (@sundaycoffeeproject). Things like turning on post notifications, saving and sharing posts, sending posts to friends, etc., raises our engagement drastically.</li>
<li>Give us a good review on Google (once you’ve tasted our coffee, of course)</li>
<li>If you have any friends, neighbors, family, businesses, cafes, or restaurants that need coffee, refer them to us!</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you again for all the support and love. We feel very fortunate to have you all supporting us.</p>

We’re Aaron & Ryley (and Judah & Aydan), and we’re very excited to share sunday coffee project (@sundaycoffeeproject) with you!

Sunday is our favorite day as a family. It always has been. Sundays look different for us seasonally, but the reason it’s become so special to our family is because it’s the day that we have no agenda. We hang out, we drink coffee, sometimes we get out and explore, but really it’s the day that we get to just be together.
This project is our way of inviting you to enjoy our Sundays with us. We’ll be sourcing and roasting some amazing coffees, and designing some cool apparel & lifestyle goods that we think will bring some fun and enjoyment to not only your Sunday, but every day!

Aaron, our roaster, has worked in specialty coffee for several years, with most of his time being at a cafe near where we live here in Portland, OR.  In 2020 he placed within the top 20 coffee brewers nationally in the US Coffee Championships’ Brewers Cup.  His high attention to detail and pursuit of excellence means we’re dedicated to always offering you a selection of high quality coffees that you can sip while reading a new book, taking a walk around the neighborhood, or catching up on your favorite podcast.
We believe specialty coffee should be exciting and approachable. We realize that isn’t always the experience in this industry, and we’re committed to demonstrating that quality and approachability aren’t mutually exclusive.

</ul><p> </p></div>","Koinu : Professional Flat-edged BowlsTake advantage of a bowl that has been made for Professionals to be both durable and functionable!We at Honma Manufacturing have been creating cookware for professionals for the past 70 years under the Koinu Brand, and are looking to release a set of cooking bowls focusing on ease of use and durability. Taking the advice of many different professional chefs, we want to create Kitchenware that all types of users can use easily and reliably!Changing the concept of the kitchen bowlEvery household has an ordinary bowl or mesh bowl for cooking.There has been no major innovation in their long history.Honma, a manufacturer of professional kitchen products, has created a product that is a grade above the rest by incorporating the voices of professionals into the bowl that is found in at least one kitchen.We have developed a bowl that is highly durable and can be used hygienically for a lifetime -- and this extraordinary bowl is worth every penny.New Sizes Available With this project we also wanted to create a variety of bowl sizes that matches the needs of backers in the West. Our original bowl size was the 18cm bowl, but for this project we decided to create a larger bowl, the 21cm, as well as a smaller bowl, the 15cm bowl! With these bowls, we hope that our backers can find many ways that Koinu can complement your cooking! These bowls are not available anywhere outside of this INDIEGOGO campaign at present, but we plan to go to market after this campaign has finished.Since our founding, we have focused on creating cookware for professionals under the Koinu Brand name. This bowl was born of the many requests we have received from culinary experts, asking for bowls that incorporate ease of usability into their making.LEFT:Mitsuru Ishidaka, Factory Manager.   Right:Kazunari Honma, CEO, Honma Manufacturing Co. Most bowls have an edge that curves under. However, this type of edge makes it harder to clean the bowls, trapping waste and water under the rim. This creates unsanitary conditions, not something that you want with a bowl used for cooking.In comparison, our Koinu bowls feature a flat edge. This makes it easier to clean, and harder for dirt and water to get stuck, which makes it far more hygienic!The innovative flat edge makes it easier to create a spout that allows for better pouring.  Even the most viscous of liquids, such as eggs, pour with ease. The shape of the spout is much better suited for liquids than a bowl with a rimmed edge. When you look inside the bowl, you can see that the surface is quite smooth and shiny. This is the product of both hand polishing and electropolishing!Most bowls, when used to whip cream, often allow tiny particles of the stainless steel to come off, slightly discolouring the whip. Until now!Electropolishing is applied to the surface of our bowls, to keep the particles from separating, and help prevent food discolouration from occurring.Our bowls also feature a presswork scale on the inside of the bowl, so if you are following a recipe that only needs a rough estimation of ingredients, you can use the scale inside the bowl.The bowl and mesh bowl have been made with a slight difference in height, meaning when placed together, there is a small space between them. This means that you can fit a finger in between the two bowls, to easily separate and transport them individually.This also means that when separating water, it is easier to do so without any of the ingredients slipping out. We think that even normal everyday cooks can be free of this bothersome annoyance that happens with other types of bowls.With other bowls, you might have thought, ""Oh it's stainless steel, it should be pretty tough"" -- then it breaks on you. Or maybe you've had mesh bowls split apart, or permanently warp, or even the base of the bowl may come undone. With our Koinu brand, you can be assured that we only let quality products out of our factory. We ensure this quality by using roughly 0.57mm thick wire -- much thicker than conventional mesh bowls, which helps to strengthen the bowl. This strength means that even with heavy everyday use, we feel very comfortable saying that you can use it for the rest of your life. In order to back up this claim, we tested out the strength of the bowl. We were able to hold over 8.5kg of weight in the bowl, without any sign of it bending. Thanks to its durability, you can scrub it with a hard brush without worrying about damaging the wire. We’ve also created a combination tray/lid that is both simple and functional.Use this lid to secure the ingredients inside the bowl as you pour water out. Give it a good shake to get even more water out, and the lid still holds.You can also use it as a tray to place ingredients that you have cut and washed.When you want to put anything in the fridge, you can use the lid to seal the bowl and not worry about using wasteful wraps or unreliable covers.This tray/lid is a highly functional piece of cookware, but is extremely simple in its design.We create our mesh bowl by weaving wire together, which is far superior to just hole-punching a sheet of metal. This makes it more efficient when draining water, and smaller items like rice aren’t lost through our weaved wire.At a glance, it might seem that these are minor improvements, But when brought together, they help to greatly improve an already good product. By helping you to cook smarter, your stress in the kitchen will also be reduced, helping you to enjoy your time cooking!This bowl series is created at our factory in Tsubame Sanjo in Niigata Prefecture. Tsubame Sanjo is one of, if not the, largest metal processing towns in Japan.Honma Manufacturing (Honma Seisakujo) has been around for 70 years, with our brand, (Koinu Shirushi) literally meaning Mark of the Puppy. We cater to professional kitchens at restaurants, schools, cafeterias, and food processing companies with our Kitchenware.We work to create everything in-house, from the planning stages to the production and manufacturing of the product.We create products from large oversized pots to teapots and bowls, giving us expertise  in a wide assortment of various-sized products.When it comes to manufacturing, prototypes and moulds are our biggest assets.Bowls and trays normally come from one sheet of stainless steel.A flat-edged bowl is considered to be quite difficult to make, for one big reason. When the steel is pressed into the bowl shape, it is common for the steel to wrinkle in the mould, causing the bowl to have imperfections.Here at Honma Manufacturing, we have succeeded in creating moulds that make the steel conform to the shape properly. This lowers the likelihood of wrinkling, and allows us to adjust and fine-tune the moulds, to help lower this likelihood even more.Though the bowls are technically mass produced, we still check each bowl thoroughly.We also have a final inspection, where the bowl is again checked by our manufacturing team. If they feel that the bowl is off -- even slightly -- we don’t allow the product to go out.With our rigid checks and quality assurance processes, we have gained the recognition and trust of many professionals in the industry.The Mesh Bowl was created in cooperation with another company in Tsubame Sanjo, Minex Metal Co. ltd. They are a manufacturing company that focuses on items that use the same type of mesh and wire we use.The Mesh Bowl also starts out as a flat sheet. They cut each bowl and then mould it, one by one, from a single sheet of meshed metal.In order to create a bowl that is extremely durable and keeps its shape, we went through a large amount of trial and error.A sturdy but deep mesh bowl is extremely hard to create, but after a long testing period, we were able to create the final product that is found in this project.New Logo DesignUntil now, we have used English with our logo, the cute little puppy logo that has always appeared on our products. But in order to appeal to western backers, we have changed from this English design to a more Japanese design, incorporating our name in Kanji (Chinese Characters that Japanese people use to write).You can see our new logo below:This logo mark will be embossed onto the flat edge that makes our bowls unique. This will be incorporated onto all sizes of the mesh bowl.SPEC Schedule Risks & Challenges
The designs, colors and specifications are subject to change.
The shipping time may be delayed depending on the order status, the supply status of the materials, and the manufacturing process. 
Due to COVID-19, the production of the Flat edge Bowl may take longer than our manufacturing schedule.
We ask for your understanding in this matter. COVID-19 is affecting delivery and transportation speed, so please keep in mind that the delivery of the  Flat edge Bowl  may be delayed.
If we are successful and the project is funded, we will not be able to offer refunds.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">What is Vita Nova Creatives &amp; Coffee?</span></h3>
<p>Vita Nova Creatives &amp; Coffee is a community based artisan boutique and coffee bar located in Northern Virginia. Founded by Paula Millar and her two daughters Danielle Millar and Rebecca Ferguson and her daughter-in-law Jessica Millar in 2020. </p>
<p>A Note from Paula: </p>
<p>I was drawn to the name Vita Nova because of it’s meaning: “New Life” and the implications it has on each of our lives as we are entering into new stages and chapters. For me personally, my children have grown and although I’ve always loved art and raising my 4 kids, that stage in life made it difficult for me to find time to pursue the artistic outlets that I love.</p>
<p>We have already begun the process of opening our coffee shop boutique which pairs beautifully all of my passions: my kids, my creativity, and coffee.</p>
<p>Family has always been important to me and I am blessed with the opportunity to operate this store with my two daughters and my daughter-in-law. Our intention is to have our shop feel home-y to the community and to make it a gathering place for the nearby Nokesville, Bristow, and Manassas neighborhoods and businesses and those to our west. We look forward to partnering with the community and providing a service that is not yet available in the area.</p>
<p>Along with family I have always loved treasure hunting and looking for interesting things. I frequent flea markets, auctions, and antique shops to find the diamond in the rough. I enjoy upcycling furniture and breathing new life into old things. I find great joy in creating art on canvases of all kinds beyond the norm and am looking forward to teaching others how to do the same. Vita Nova Creatives &amp; Coffee will be offering a variety of art classes aimed towards various skill levels and artforms.</p>
<p>The last element of our boutique that we are excited to unfold is our coffee bar.  Part of what makes a community great is a place to gather together. Nokesville does not currently have a coffee shop nearby and we are aiming to offer that service. Our location on the corner of Nokesville Rd and Fitzwater Dr will service not only the nearby private and public schools and numerous local businesses, but will also service the large amounts of commuter traffic headed North on Route 28 into DC in the early mornings. We plan to offer drip coffee, espresso drinks, tea, smoothies, and various local baked goods.</p>

</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We already have funding in place for the basic build-out of our leased spaced. We are working with an architect to ensure we are on the right track to re-zone the location for assembly use for our coffee shop and anticipate beginning to build-out by May. However, we are in need of funds to support our partnership with Crimson Cup - a company we have hired to start up the coffee portion of our store. Our partnership with Crimson Cup and your contributions will fund the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Coffee Grinders</li>
<li>Espresso Machines</li>
<li>Blenders (for frozen drinks and smoothies)</li>
<li>Brewers</li>
<li>Fridges, freezers, and ice makers</li>
<li>Hands-on training of baristas and staff</li>
<li>Starting Inventory</li>
</ul>
<p>We do have a detailed business plan and a complete Proforma laying out all the projected costs and detailing what our first three years could look like, trying to be conservative, and we're very optimistic! The Indiegogo campaign will provide a little less than 30% of the startup costs, and we are securing and self-funding the rest. The 30% provided by the campaign is critically important, and we are so very grateful for your help! </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact</h3>
<p>Vita Nova Creatives &amp; Coffee aims to create a space for the members of the nearby communities to gather together. We have a firm belief that community is important and especially in this current time each of us needs a place to escape and relax to. Our boutique styled coffee shop will offer not only coffee and fellowship, but also workshop classes in various art techniques and local vendors. Our goal as a store will be to support small businesses and local artisans and to create something everyone nearby can take ownership in. </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our biggest risk at this point in time would be falling short on the funds required to purchase the coffee equipment needed to start up the store. We already have a lease on the space and the funding in place for the build-out of the space, but without a successful campaign we are at risk of not being able to immediately install our equipment and therefore our shop will need to open with just the boutique and workshop space until we can manage the funding necessary for working alongside Crimson Cup.  </p>

Our campaign ended earlier than intended, so we invite you to check out our website vitanovacreatives.com. For now, it will take you to our newsletter signup, though we are seeing if we can make a carry-over campaign page there. You can also email us at paula@vitanovacreatives.com or message us through our FB page, http://facebook.com/vitanovacreatives, with your backer level and perk desire, and we'll make sure you can contribute and receive your fun perk items! Thank you!
What is Vita Nova Creatives & Coffee?
Vita Nova Creatives & Coffee is a community based artisan boutique and coffee bar located in Northern Virginia. Founded by Paula Millar and her two daughters Danielle Millar and Rebecca Ferguson and her daughter-in-law Jessica Millar in 2020. 
A Note from Paula: 
I was drawn to the name Vita Nova because of it’s meaning: “New Life” and the implications it has on each of our lives as we are entering into new stages and chapters. For me personally, my children have grown and although I’ve always loved art and raising my 4 kids, that stage in life made it difficult for me to find time to pursue the artistic outlets that I love.
We have already begun the process of opening our coffee shop boutique which pairs beautifully all of my passions: my kids, my creativity, and coffee.
Family has always been important to me and I am blessed with the opportunity to operate this store with my two daughters and my daughter-in-law. Our intention is to have our shop feel home-y to the community and to make it a gathering place for the nearby Nokesville, Bristow, and Manassas neighborhoods and businesses and those to our west. We look forward to partnering with the community and providing a service that is not yet available in the area.
Along with family I have always loved treasure hunting and looking for interesting things. I frequent flea markets, auctions, and antique shops to find the diamond in the rough. I enjoy upcycling furniture and breathing new life into old things. I find great joy in creating art on canvases of all kinds beyond the norm and am looking forward to teaching others how to do the same. Vita Nova Creatives & Coffee will be offering a variety of art classes aimed towards various skill levels and artforms.
The last element of our boutique that we are excited to unfold is our coffee bar.  Part of what makes a community great is a place to gather together. Nokesville does not currently have a coffee shop nearby and we are aiming to offer that service. Our location on the corner of Nokesville Rd and Fitzwater Dr will service not only the nearby private and public schools and numerous local businesses, but will also service the large amounts of commuter traffic headed North on Route 28 into DC in the early mornings. We plan to offer drip coffee, espresso drinks, tea, smoothies, and various local baked goods.

What We Need & What You Get
We already have funding in place for the basic build-out of our leased spaced. We are working with an architect to ensure we are on the right track to re-zone the location for assembly use for our coffee shop and anticipate beginning to build-out by May. However, we are in need of funds to support our partnership with Crimson Cup - a company we have hired to start up the coffee portion of our store. Our partnership with Crimson Cup and your contributions will fund the following: 

Coffee Grinders
Espresso Machines
Blenders (for frozen drinks and smoothies)
Brewers
Fridges, freezers, and ice makers
Hands-on training of baristas and staff
Starting Inventory

We do have a detailed business plan and a complete Proforma laying out all the projected costs and detailing what our first three years could look like, trying to be conservative, and we're very optimistic! The Indiegogo campaign will provide a little less than 30% of the startup costs, and we are securing and self-funding the rest. The 30% provided by the campaign is critically important, and we are so very grateful for your help! 

The Impact
Vita Nova Creatives & Coffee aims to create a space for the members of the nearby communities to gather together. We have a firm belief that community is important and especially in this current time each of us needs a place to escape and relax to. Our boutique styled coffee shop will offer not only coffee and fellowship, but also workshop classes in various art techniques and local vendors. Our goal as a store will be to support small businesses and local artisans and to create something everyone nearby can take ownership in. 

Risks & Challenges
Our biggest risk at this point in time would be falling short on the funds required to purchase the coffee equipment needed to start up the store. We already have a lease on the space and the funding in place for the build-out of the space, but without a successful campaign we are at risk of not being able to immediately install our equipment and therefore our shop will need to open with just the boutique and workshop space until we can manage the funding necessary for working alongside Crimson Cup.

Vi bruker et svært konsentrert ekstrakt som inneholder en gruppe stoffer svært gunstig for kognitiv prestasjon- og helse, som bla. fremmer regenerering av nevroner og myelinering av nervebaner.  Reishi - Ganoderma Lucidum - The plant of ImmortalityEn annen tresopp med hovedvekt i sin funksjon på immunforsvar og organfunksjon. Den kan også bidra til å senke stress (cortisol-nivå), forbedre søvn og øke mental klarhet gjennom sine antioksidative, antivirale og anti-inflammatoriske egenskaper. Mer informasjon og henvisning til forskning vil bli tilgjengelig på nettsidene.  “Vi skal utfordre morgenkaffen med en adaptogen ""voksen"" kakao; en minimalt prosessert, potent kloss kakaomasse med en spennende smaksprofil, tilsatt adaptogenene Lions Mane og Reishi. Sukkerfri, og som et heftig mineral og kosttilskudd man åpner hjertet, starter hjernen og vedlikeholder vesenet med.”Hvem er jeg? Akkurat det har jeg lurt på en del ganger, men funnet ut at cacao definitivt gjør oppdagelsesferden mer interresant. Min livs-ideologi; “Livet er ikke fett hvis det er for behagelig” tok meg i 2018 ut på en to års jordomseiling på egenhånd. Jeg havnet i Amazonas, og fikk oppleve cacao-frukten på trærne, og fersk cacao. Med mitt betydelige fokus på medisinske planter, kosthold og ernæring, som har vært med meg i mange år, fikk det nye møtet med cacao en kraftig renessanse. Videre på reisen gjennom de Karibiske øyer ble cacao og kulturen rundt, et stort fokus, før jeg seilte tilbake over Nord-Atlanteren sommeren 2020, og ble en del av den sermonielle cacaokulturen i Norge.Jeg er nå 28 år, og i ferd med å etablere et liv i Rollag i en kultur av unge voksne som ønsker å flytte ut av byen. Jeg ønsker derfor å etablere en bedrift som kan skape arbeidsplasser, økonomisk vekst samt bidra til mat- og kulturtilbudet her i bygda. Amazonas 2019  - SailingChilli.comSelskapetCacaoisme AS ble etablert 02.02.21 i Rollag, Numedal
Bærekraftig og styrkende for lokalbefolkning og natur lokalt hvor cacaoen dyrkes
Økologisk og Fairtrade
Seremoniell kvalitet
Cacao fra naturlige habitater (agroforestry) og ikke monokultur
Stimulere til studier på næringsinnhold og forringelse av cacao samt adaptogenene
Kunnskapskilde for cacao, adaptogener og kosttilskudd (relevant for prosjektet)
Bidra til bevisstgjøring om skadelighet av alkohol og sukker 
Fokus på mental og psykosomatisk helse, immunforsvar, oppvekst og aldring
Full transparens fra bonden til koppen
 Prosessen
Cacao-frukten blir høstet
Fermentert i eget fruktkjøtt 4-6 dager
Tørket 
Seilbåt (I wish) over havet
Roast (ca som kaffe)
Knus og avskalling - Nibs
Finkværning - cacaomasse
Blande inn sopp
Støp 
Flyt!
IngredienserIkke to cacaobønner er like eller smaker likt. Cacao er en levende og mektig plante som må behandles individuelt, og derfor vil ingredienslista og smaksprofil variere kontinuelig. Konkret innholdsliste vil være på etiketten. Alt er naturligvis økologisk- og fairtrade sertifisert, sukker- og soyafritt, lavkarbo og ketovennlig.
Cacaomasse
Lions Mane (vann + alkohol ekstrakt)
Reishi (vann + alkohol ekstrakt)
Munkefrukt og/eller Yacon 
Solsikke Lecitin  - Superbra for nervebaner!
Himalaya salt
Einerbær
MCT olje
Cacaoen du nå kan glede deg til vil se litt røff ut. Det er fordi den ikke er ""temperert"", slik som sjokolade. Den vil være ""bloomed"", altså ha hvite områder og boblemønstre. Det er slik sjokolade ser ut, og har ingenting med holdbarhet å gjøre; kun hvordan den er avkjølt. PartnereHeldigvis er jeg ikke alene med ønsket om cacaofabrikk i Rollag. Mine venner (bla.) i bygda har bidratt med midler til prosessen hittil og fremtidig trygghet for etablering.

<p><strong>Who are we:</strong> </p>
<p>My Dad and I are a nerdy and goofy Father/Daughter duo working together to bring a small summer village their first high-end donut shop and bakery. Our dream has been to one day open our own bakery, stemming from our backgrounds in baking. Our family has grown up spending weekends and holidays at Pigeon Lake and we consider it to be our second home. My Dad and I are extremely passionate and driven to support our Lake community. Our goal is to keep it local! All fresh fruits, honey and herbs will be supplied by farmers and businesses in the area so we can all help drive the economy. </p>
<p><strong>Meet Dan:</strong> Dan is a creative and fun-loving guy who always seeks opportunities to turn a fascinating craft or hobby into something more. He has an extensive background in business and will be leading as Head of Operations and Lead Baker. Dan spends his down-time building miniature fantasy-themed dioramas. Dan is incredibly eager to meet his customers. You won’t catch him ever shying away from a chat, and the jokes won’t stop comin’! </p>
<p><strong>Meet Sabrina:</strong> Young and aspiring, Sabrina brings her creativity and passion to her baking. When she is not online with her friends or playing Dungeons and Dragons, her spare time consists of experimenting with flavors and textures to make something truly unique to the consumer.  Sabrina gets her outgoing nature from Dan, and together, they are sure to keep the atmosphere lively!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our Mission:</strong> </p>
<p>Our mission is to provide a small rural community with their first gourmet bakery. We are excited to collaborate with neighboring businesses in support of all the services that Pigeon Lake and the surrounding areas have to offer. </p>
<p>In addition to supporting the local economy, we value the environment, striving to be as plastic and paper-free as possible. That means using recyclable or compostable packaging, digital recipes in the bakery and e-receipts for customers. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our Products:</strong></p>
<p>While our main focus is our specialty donuts, we also want to produce unique novelties such as cookies, squares, cupcakes, and cereal treats. As our business grows and we start seeing success, our goal will be to start introducing custom orders, cakes, and bulk products.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How You’re Helping:</strong></p>
<p>With each dollar donated, you will be helping us pay for our bakery equipment, building renovations, ingredient costs, starting wages, as well as costs of operation. Your support will mean that we will have more budget to produce more and better products as well as helping ensure we are able to get started on opening that much sooner and let’s face it, no one wants to wait for donuts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>Opening a bakery is tough at the best of times, never mind during Covid. We are taking special considerations to make sure we can open up with all the necessary precautions and requirements. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our biggest obstacle will be managing production and making sure we can make the very best products for our customers. In an area with little to no competition, it will be difficult to gauge how much traffic we will generate, but we are eager and determined to succeed nonetheless. We are both passionate and driven individuals and we will be learning and growing throughout our journey together to give our clients the best bakery experience possible.</p>

We're ready to get the fun started!</p><p>Toma Mojo Grill is all about bright, fresh flavors served in a variety of healthy ways with meal options that are great for one, two or a crowd! We love mojo marinated chicken served on sandwiches, bone-in plates with tasty sides, or whole roast chicken dinners for the entire family! Pulled pork, vegetarian dishes and flavorful sides make sure there is something for everyone.   Hot, spicy, tangy, smoky and cooling sauces are served on the side to kick things up. Mix and match to create your own flavor experience!</p><p>Say hello to the west metro’s newest fast casual restaurant! Toma Mojo Grill is located just off 394 and Plymouth Road, west of Ridgedale Center, and in the same complex as Second Swing. Toma Mojo Grill features a 75-seat dining room, 25 seat patio and a 6-seat counter. Regional tap beer, organic wine, canned adult beverages and a selection of house made Sangria will be served to accompany the food or to be enjoyed on its own! </p><p>With over 30 years of cumulative hospitality experience, from fast food chains to award winning neighborhood bistros, Paul Backer and Michael Knox are excited to bring Toma Mojo Grill to Minnetonka.

Paul worked his way up from a kitchen support staff position to Chef Du Cuisine, while Mike worked his way up from a bartending position to General Manager. With the help of several friends and family members, Toma Mojo Grill has been in development for several years.</p><p>“Toma Mojo Grill is a fast casual restaurant with a focus on Mediterranean flavors from Spain and Portugal.

We've launched this campaign to initiate our friends, family, neighbors and future patrons into our clubs, offer early-bird opportunities to score exclusive merch, and the opportunity to be the pioneering participants in some pretty unique perks. We're ready to get the fun started!Toma Mojo Grill is all about bright, fresh flavors served in a variety of healthy ways with meal options that are great for one, two or a crowd! We love mojo marinated chicken served on sandwiches, bone-in plates with tasty sides, or whole roast chicken dinners for the entire family! Pulled pork, vegetarian dishes and flavorful sides make sure there is something for everyone.   Hot, spicy, tangy, smoky and cooling sauces are served on the side to kick things up. Mix and match to create your own flavor experience!Say hello to the west metro’s newest fast casual restaurant! Toma Mojo Grill is located just off 394 and Plymouth Road, west of Ridgedale Center, and in the same complex as Second Swing. Toma Mojo Grill features a 75-seat dining room, 25 seat patio and a 6-seat counter. Regional tap beer, organic wine, canned adult beverages and a selection of house made Sangria will be served to accompany the food or to be enjoyed on its own! With over 30 years of cumulative hospitality experience, from fast food chains to award winning neighborhood bistros, Paul Backer and Michael Knox are excited to bring Toma Mojo Grill to Minnetonka. The two partners met almost a decade ago at famed neighborhood restaurant Tilia as part of the opening crew. Paul worked his way up from a kitchen support staff position to Chef Du Cuisine, while Mike worked his way up from a bartending position to General Manager. With the help of several friends and family members, Toma Mojo Grill has been in development for several years.“Toma Mojo Grill is a fast casual restaurant with a focus on Mediterranean flavors from Spain and Portugal. This cuisine features fresh flavors that are lightly smoky, highly craveable, and a naturally-healthy, better-for-you option.” – Paul Backer  “I’m excited to present Toma Mojo Grill’s food and beverages in a fun and welcoming setting.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Maybe you’ve heard about us from a friend who’s been raving about our mead. Or you could be a big fan, reading every email, following us on Instagram and liking every post. Or maybe you're new to mead and aren’t sure where to start. Whatever the case, we’re glad you found us.</p>
<p>Our love for mead started as a slow growing obsession and has now become a full blown passion. We go to great efforts to reinvent flavors not easily found or never seen as a mead before. We’re known for our sweet, full bodied flavors packed with unconventional, real ingredients, We’ve even shoved shortbread cookies in a mead because imitation flavors didn’t taste the same. How many times have you bought a cinnamon roll stout and been disappointed because it was more like a watery oatmeal porter? If we promise a flavor on the label, that’s what the mead inside will taste like.</p>
<p>By continually innovating our recipes, we are proof that mead doesn’t always have to abide by medieval or ancient standards. Mead can transport you to a warm beach day in Mexico, tea time in England, or your grandma’s kitchen full of fresh baked pie. If you’ve dreamed of drinking your desserts, we’re right up your alley. If you prefer smooth mixed drinks, we’re probably a good choice for you too. Our meads have been described as phenomenal, unique, honey-forward, dangerously good, unconventional, and a craft drinkers dream. We look forward to launching in 2019 and sharing our passion with you.</p>

<p>First, we have a 90s inspired sticker sheet featuring label art from some of our favorite meads including Princess Lily, Island Sun, Illegal Leopard and Stake Your Pain. The individual stickers are perfect size for a laptop or beer fridge.</p>

<p>If you love custom art then you'll definitely want our mead-stronaut bottle opener. The astronaut theme has two meanings to us - we approach meadmaking with an open mind, ready to explore new and undiscovered flavors. It also represents our initiative to invite others to discover (or rediscover) mead.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1546204302/nj9fiffwpgmjv1q1yolh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Next we have our 12oz stemless tumbler glass. Its curved base is perfectly balanced to allow for swirling, sniffing and tasting your drink of choice. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1546204318/qgstx9hn5ywwf9mvrs1c.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Moving into apparel, we've selected a soft tri-blend shirt that showcases our slogan ""Unconventional. Imaginative. Artistic."" It's pre-washed and super soft, making it one of our favorites.</p>

<p>Last of all, our leather patch logo hat. This premium structured cap features an adjustable plastic snap tab for the perfect fit and our logo debossed onto a leather patch made in the USA. Each level includes the previous perks so you don't have to pick your favorite; choose the Nightcap level and get them all.</p>

Example Meads:

Vanilla blueberry aged in bourbon barrels
Rye cherry mocha aged in rye barrels
Orange cherry vanilla aged in Blantons tequila barrels

*Subject to change depending on barrel availability.
**To comply with state laws, members will purchase their bottles at the bottle release event. We are including a member gift card in your welcome box to cover the cost of the bottles. Releases will be announced  at a later date and everyone will be kept in the loop as our membership program evolves.
The ""Half Pint"" Membership
LIMITED TIME - Choose this perk to receive access to *1 bottle each* of our 4 Mielmigos Society meads. (Mielmigos Society meads will be packaged in a 750ml swingtop bottle). Also includes merch ($100 value) and first right to refusal for regular meads.
Other Perks
In addition to our Mielmigos Society membership, we've designed some pretty cool perks we hope you’ll like.

First, we have a 90s inspired sticker sheet featuring label art from some of our favorite meads including Princess Lily, Island Sun, Illegal Leopard and Stake Your Pain. The individual stickers are perfect size for a laptop or beer fridge.

If you love custom art then you'll definitely want our mead-stronaut bottle opener. The astronaut theme has two meanings to us - we approach meadmaking with an open mind, ready to explore new and undiscovered flavors. It also represents our initiative to invite others to discover (or rediscover) mead.

Next we have our 12oz stemless tumbler glass. Its curved base is perfectly balanced to allow for swirling, sniffing and tasting your drink of choice. 

Moving into apparel, we've selected a soft tri-blend shirt that showcases our slogan ""Unconventional. Imaginative. Artistic."" It's pre-washed and super soft, making it one of our favorites.

Last of all, our leather patch logo hat. This premium structured cap features an adjustable plastic snap tab for the perfect fit and our logo debossed onto a leather patch made in the USA. Each level includes the previous perks so you don't have to pick your favorite; choose the Nightcap level and get them all.
 

Risks & Challenges
Luckily, our partnership with Dry County Brewing means we will have immediate access to the brewery's equipment, so once we’re licensed we can begin production. We will keep you updated on our licensing status over the next couple months.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you’re broke from last month’s bottle release or Christmas, you can still help us out. Use Indiegogo’s built-in share tools to post our campaign and tell your booze-loving friends about the next big thing in craft beverages. We appreciate all of your support so far and look forward to kicking things off in 2019.

<p>Greetings, Chocolate Lovers! </p>
<p>           We are the <strong><a href=""http://silvermoonchocolate.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Silvermoon Chocolate</a> family</strong>, an Asheville-based company built upon the vision of Aradhana Silverman and her mission to share the uplifting magic of pure, organic, unroasted, handmade-with-love chocolate.</p>
<p>        Aradhana's obsession with chocolate began in <strong>Topanga, California in early 2007.</strong>  Silvermoon Chocolate was born and nurtured during the height of the Los Angeles raw food movement, growing up alongside its sibling, our husband-wife musical project, <strong><a href=""http://istarvision.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">I,Star</a></strong>.  She began making treats and selling them at the band's music events, where people went nuts for Aradhana's creations.  Our company was the result of adamant demands from our community! After five years of dazzling taste buds on the West Coast, we were called to relocate to our current home in <strong>Asheville, North Carolina</strong> to pursue our musical and chocolate dreams and start a family.</p>
<p>         Landing, however, was wrought with perils in our personal lives, causing us to lose nearly everything we had worked so hard for. The setbacks we faced in our first year have taken years to rebuild and heal from, yet somehow during that time, we were still able to establish ourselves as a strong local brand in our community. Our company has been slowly growing, and we've built a significant grassroots network of support in Asheville &amp; the local surrounding areas. </p>
<p>Our products are sold everywhere from Whole Foods Markets to the largest local farmers' market, coffee and tea shops, boutique hotels and natural foods cooperatives. We've taken our booth on tour with our band to festivals up and down the east coast and into the midwest, introducing our brand to awestruck mouths with the promise of future local availability! Although demand is high, our growth has been slow due to a shortage of time, energy and resources. Growing a small family business is a labour of love, and as with raising our beautiful four-year old daughter, has often  required near round-the-clock effort...</p>

<p>        While we honor and support the numerous artisans and companies now working with organic and fair-trade, roasted cacao, due to the <strong>nutrient loss and damage to fatty acids that can occur in the roasting process</strong>, we've prioritized using naturally fermented yet unroasted cacao.  We envision a world in which the modern concept of chocolate as a sugary candy or guilty pleasure evolves to embrace the full potential of its natural state . At Silvermoon Chocolate, we know Chocolate in its un-roasted, minimally processed form, packed full of <strong><a href=""http://foodfacts.mercola.com/cacao.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">essential minerals (incl. magnesium, iron, calcium), antioxidant flavinoids, intact fatty acids, vitamins, protein and fiber</a>, </strong>not to mention its <a href=""https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/cocoa-sweet-treat-brain-201502057676"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>well-documented effect on brain chemistry and cardiac health</strong></a>.  The ancient <a href=""http://www.sacredearth.com/ethnobotany/plantprofiles/cacao.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">traditional Mayan, Olmec, and Aztec use of cacao</a> as a sacred heart and spirit medicine has now been proven by modern science!!  Aradhana has alchemized and perfected a blend of cacao, coconut, and almond butter, over 20 different herbs and superfoods, with a touch of honey and bee pollen to create our flagship Medicine Balls, among other delightful Silvermooon Chocolate creations to bring forth the bliss and benefits.             </p>
<p>One of the saddest things about creating a chocolate business has been realizing the degree to which this industry has remained rooted in the <a href=""http://fortune.com/big-chocolate-child-labor/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>exploitative colonial system</strong> </a>from which it was born, with massive plantation-style cacao farms, <strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeJy3dA4Ahk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">many companies still utilizing unethical labor practices</a></strong> in their supply chain, as well as the modern blights of petrochemical pesticides and fertilizers in standard growing procedure. Many of these workers have <strong>never even tasted the final product!</strong> Add to that poor quality cacao, refined sugars, additives, and other toxic ingredients, and that’s what most people know as chocolate!<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1512504267/whxpxpok4ourguehe2cw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>          Now, we need<strong> YOU </strong>to help transform Silvermoon Chocolate into the tour de force that can shift the chocolate paradigm into one of Health, Sustainability, and Prosperity from grower to producer to consumer.</p>

Greetings, Chocolate Lovers! 
           We are the Silvermoon Chocolate family, an Asheville-based company built upon the vision of Aradhana Silverman and her mission to share the uplifting magic of pure, organic, unroasted, handmade-with-love chocolate.
        Aradhana's obsession with chocolate began in Topanga, California in early 2007.  Silvermoon Chocolate was born and nurtured during the height of the Los Angeles raw food movement, growing up alongside its sibling, our husband-wife musical project, I,Star.  She began making treats and selling them at the band's music events, where people went nuts for Aradhana's creations.  Our company was the result of adamant demands from our community! After five years of dazzling taste buds on the West Coast, we were called to relocate to our current home in Asheville, North Carolina to pursue our musical and chocolate dreams and start a family.
         Landing, however, was wrought with perils in our personal lives, causing us to lose nearly everything we had worked so hard for. The setbacks we faced in our first year have taken years to rebuild and heal from, yet somehow during that time, we were still able to establish ourselves as a strong local brand in our community. Our company has been slowly growing, and we've built a significant grassroots network of support in Asheville & the local surrounding areas. 
Our products are sold everywhere from Whole Foods Markets to the largest local farmers' market, coffee and tea shops, boutique hotels and natural foods cooperatives. We've taken our booth on tour with our band to festivals up and down the east coast and into the midwest, introducing our brand to awestruck mouths with the promise of future local availability! Although demand is high, our growth has been slow due to a shortage of time, energy and resources. Growing a small family business is a labour of love, and as with raising our beautiful four-year old daughter, has often  required near round-the-clock effort...
.

Now that we've made it this far without taking on any outside investment, we're so inspired imagining what we could do with a little help from our friends! Dedicated and determined, with our Chocolate Engine running, we're ready to rise to meet our destiny!
  This is our Vision:
Let food be thy Medicine and Medicine be thy Food! 
 
        While we honor and support the numerous artisans and companies now working with organic and fair-trade, roasted cacao, due to the nutrient loss and damage to fatty acids that can occur in the roasting process, we've prioritized using naturally fermented yet unroasted cacao.  We envision a world in which the modern concept of chocolate as a sugary candy or guilty pleasure evolves to embrace the full potential of its natural state .

Many of these workers have never even tasted the final product! Add to that poor quality cacao, refined sugars, additives, and other toxic ingredients, and that’s what most people know as chocolate!
          Now, we need YOU to help transform Silvermoon Chocolate into the tour de force that can shift the chocolate paradigm into one of Health, Sustainability, and Prosperity from grower to producer to consumer.

<h3>THE SECRET TO DIET STICKS: APPETITE SUPPRESSION!</h3>
<p>Appetite suppression works by tricking the body into believing that it is not hungry, or that it is full. Appetite suppressants decrease appetite by increasing serotonin or catecholamine, two brain chemicals that affect mood and appetite. Diet Sticks uses four different appetite suppressants: Caralluma Fimbriata, Chromium Polynicotinate, 5-HTP, and Saffron Extract. All four have clinical evidence of their effectiveness, and have all been recommended by television's Dr. Oz.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>We believe that appetite suppression is the <b>future of weight loss</b>, for the following reasons:</p>
<p>·<span>  You </span>can eat as much as you want!</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>There is NO sacrifice... enjoy the same foods you do now.</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Appetite suppression is NOT a diet.</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>When people require fewer calories to feel satisfied... they tend to make HEALTHIER choices!</p>
<p>With Chocolate Diet Sticks, foods that-- previously-- would not have satisfied you (those 200-300 calorie ""healthy meals"")... are now completely satisfying!</p><p><br/></p>

<p>If we are able to raise enough funds, we will conduct a <b>double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study</b> of Chocolate Diet Sticks!

This would offer indisputable proof of efficacy, and allow us to make specific claims. We are blessed to have skilled volunteers available, and ready to help us, including Carl E. Olson (MD), Deb Baumgarten (RN), and a clinical research assistant... whose daughter lost 75 pounds using Chocolate Diet Sticks! We would also like to hire an independent auditor, and a manuscript writer.
The first dollars raised will go toward supporting the retail release and continued development of Chocolate Diet Sticks. Help us fight the obesity epidemic, and change weight loss forever!

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>TSUBI SOUP is for anyone who wants to fit more delicious, plant-based foods into their life. Whether you’re a diehard vegan or simply veggie-curious, TSUBI SOUP will add function to your snack-time and become a simple go-to, for your busy lifestyle. </p>
<p>Our soups are ultra compact, light and travel friendly and have a shelf-life of up to 18 months. They are great for travel and even emergencies when your fridge is empty, you're coffee'd out and you crave something savory, healthy and delicious. All you need is hot water, and voila! fresh soup ready to eat in 10 seconds.</p>
<p>L: Alex, C: Elly, R: Tsubi at Expo West </p>
<p>We love what we do and our happy customers are the only reason why we keep working hard at what we do.</p>
<p>HOW TSUBI SOUP BEGAN</p>
<p>My name is Tsubi. It's short for Tsubasa. I used to eat a lot of meat and dairy, but a series of health issues led me to a plant-based diet. I was in my early 30's and was willing to try anything. After just a few weeks of eating balanced, whole plant-foods, I noticed a spike in my energy, mental sharpness and overall drive. So I started seeking out plant-based snacks and instant soups that I could enjoy with my busy schedule. I was horrified to find that all the instant soups I tried tasted terrible, and many were made with highly processed ingredients of unknown origins. This ignited a fire in me, and led me to find my true calling: creating delicious plant-based soups made from clean and traceable ingredients! </p>
<p>WHAT'S SPECIAL?</p>
<p>Following my Japanese roots, I began making soups with Japanese miso, an ancient paste made from fermented soybeans which is packed with natural probiotics and enzymes.  The miso used in Tsubi Soup has been made by the same family since the 1800's Edo period. Instead of using seafood for the dashi — a fundamental stock in Japanese cuisine that adds depth and savory flavor — I created the umami essence using wild seaweed and shiitake mushrooms. This plant-based dashi is the foundation of TSUBI SOUP’s three flavors, each one featuring unique miso blends and original, gourmet vegetable toppings that are fully traceable from farm to fork.  </p>
<p>TSUBI SOUPs are then freeze-dried, compressed into cubes and individually packed into single servings. This makes them ultra-light, mess-free, and easy to grab on the go. Below are our three original flavors. As you can see, there are chunky ingredients loaded into each cube. </p>
<p>Freeze drying also helps to maintain the ingredients’ molecular structure and nutritional integrity. This is a major reason why space explorers take freeze dried foods into space. Every cube is jam-packed with veggies, whose vibrant colors and textures magically come to life with the touch of boiling water.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>｀</p>
<p>WHY MADE IN JAPAN? </p>
<p>Our recipes are very simple, yet each hand picked ingredient plays an important role in the flavors and the dimensions. We use only supply chain traceable ingredients from ISO regulated, trusted suppliers in Japan, where the highest quality ingredients, advanced technology, unbeatable pride in craftsmanship, and strict quality control are the norm. This adherence to excellence is why Tsubi’s production is currently — and will always be — based in Japan. Our U.S. headquarters acts as the exclusive importer and distributor which then branches Tsubi Soup to the world.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>WHERE WE ARE NOW</p>
<p>We’ve been making our gourmet, plant-based miso soups for three years — and have come a long way since our first trade show, where we stuffed thousands of soup samples into suitcases and nervously shared TSUBI SOUP with the world for the first time. Today, multiple trade shows, vegan events and hundreds of in-store demos later, we’ve been able to reach a diverse audience of customers who truly love our concept and brand. We are super lucky and grateful to have such a supportive, organic fanbase around the world. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We’ve sold over 250,000 soups across the globe — and now we're available in some of the most incredible and innovative plant-focused stores in America (including 27 Whole Foods in the New England area alone!).  </p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you for reading</p>
<p>The last three years have been an amazing journey of triumphs and challenges and many learning experiences. We've evolved so much as a company and see incredible opportunities to grow our brand to become a household name. Tsubi Soup has been proudly self funded all the way, but this time we need your help to keep spreading this plant-based journey. We realize that we just can't do it alone, and with your support, we can keep this dream alive. Our mission is to continue bringing incredible plant-based soups to the world while also contributing to our environment, focusing on food chain transparency and most importantly, adding nourishment and convenience to your daily meals.</p>
<p>Because great vegan food is great for you, great for the animals, and wonderful for the planet.</p>

This plant-based dashi is the foundation of TSUBI SOUP’s three flavors, each one featuring unique miso blends and original, gourmet vegetable toppings that are fully traceable from farm to fork.  
TSUBI SOUPs are then freeze-dried, compressed into cubes and individually packed into single servings. This makes them ultra-light, mess-free, and easy to grab on the go. Below are our three original flavors. As you can see, there are chunky ingredients loaded into each cube. 
Freeze drying also helps to maintain the ingredients’ molecular structure and nutritional integrity. This is a major reason why space explorers take freeze dried foods into space. Every cube is jam-packed with veggies, whose vibrant colors and textures magically come to life with the touch of boiling water.

WHY MADE IN JAPAN? 
Our recipes are very simple, yet each hand picked ingredient plays an important role in the flavors and the dimensions. We use only supply chain traceable ingredients from ISO regulated, trusted suppliers in Japan, where the highest quality ingredients, advanced technology, unbeatable pride in craftsmanship, and strict quality control are the norm. This adherence to excellence is why Tsubi’s production is currently — and will always be — based in Japan. Our U.S. headquarters acts as the exclusive importer and distributor which then branches Tsubi Soup to the world.

WHERE WE ARE NOW
We’ve been making our gourmet, plant-based miso soups for three years — and have come a long way since our first trade show, where we stuffed thousands of soup samples into suitcases and nervously shared TSUBI SOUP with the world for the first time. Today, multiple trade shows, vegan events and hundreds of in-store demos later, we’ve been able to reach a diverse audience of customers who truly love our concept and brand. We are super lucky and grateful to have such a supportive, organic fanbase around the world. 
 
We’ve sold over 250,000 soups across the globe — and now we're available in some of the most incredible and innovative plant-focused stores in America (including 27 Whole Foods in the New England area alone!).

Santo Coffee Cubes are artisan made in Colombia, involving just natural and organic ingredients to conserve their freshness and aromas. They look pretty simple, right? Well, that's what we wanted: to make Santo Cubes the simplest way to make a high-quality cup of coffee.It took more than 2 years of development to find the perfect combination, testing different humidity levels, recipes, and flavors.Finally, we managed to crack the coffee code for you to enjoy. Making a Santo Coffee Cube is as simple as three steps:One of the best things about Santo Coffee Cubes is that you always know what amount of coffee you are going to need to make your perfect cup. Whether you are having a small 6-8 oz cup or making a big tumbler for your whole morning. No waste, no mess.
  
No longer will you have to stand in line at coffee shops or use single-serve pod machines that serve substandard brews.Santo Coffee Cubes saves you money and time, and gives you the option to brew the perfect premium coffee in seconds. Santo Coffee Cubes are perfect for outdoor activities! You can simply take your cubes with you and have the perfect cup of coffee anywhere your adventure takes you.Enjoy every morning without the hassle of a coffee machine or having to brew your coffee for long periods of time. Santo Coffee Cubes makes it easy, in a matter of seconds.Put it in your backpack, your purse, your pocket, your office desk, absolutely anywhere. Santo Coffee Cubes will go with you, not the other way around.With this project we have launched Santo Coffee Cubes with the following flavors: * Caramel * Mocha * Amaretto * Vanilla * Cappuccino * Hazelnut * Dark Roast * Light Roast * Decaf. With your support after hitting our $30,000 goal we stretched our goal to $80,000, and now that we have hit that goal, we want to stretch it even further to $150,000.As we mentioned before and promised we added three additional flavors.(Check the rewards for our NEW FLAVORS. Be quick and get them, they are going to be really limited. Thanks for supporting us! )  Refreshing, delicious, something to look forward to. That is the way I have always viewed coffee, dating back to my earliest travels through Colombia, a country known for growing the best coffee in the world. For a long time, I have felt the drive to share my passion for coffee with the world, giving other people a glimpse into the magic that I see in every cup. I had the opportunity to spend time in Colombia and to drink coffee fresh from the ground, an experience that is difficult to replicate. However, we have made our best efforts to bring a piece of Colombia in a cup.Within the mountains of Colombia, where the most recognized coffee in the world is grown, the people from these regions have a great impact on farming practices making sure the coffee we consume on a daily basis is at its perfect point. Behind every coffee bean that is exported to many countries around the globe, there is a farmer and his family dedicated to growing, hand picking, drying and roasting it. Their economy is based on the price of coffee, which is the main economic activity for more than 563,000 families just in Colombia.

One of our initiatives to develop this product is to be able to help and give back to Coffee Farming families around the world, starting from the Coffee Fields that produce Santo Coffee Cubes. We would like to give back to the countries that grow coffee by aiding their children, especially impoverished children who live in the countryside and struggle to make better lives for themselves. Our intention is to make a positive impact on the world in two ways, offering superb coffee and helping the children whose lives revolve around the coffee fields. A portion of proceeds will be donated to help coffee growers and their children have a better quality of life.     WHY INDIEGOGO INDEMAND?
 After two years of working with our team of experienced farmers, family and entrepreneurs on this project, we can say we have almost everything ready to start producing Santo Coffee Cubes the right way. However, as a startup, some of our trusted manufacturing partners in Colombia and the US need a minimum financial commitment from us to get started on a larger manufacturing run, so we can lower costs and production times. This is why we have emerged into Indiegogo Indemand, which will give us kickstart to our dream. By hitting our funding goal and get more people to support us, we are able to produce our final product in larger quantities, put our first big order with the quality that we want, so that we are able to serve every customer's demand. With this said, everyone who helps us in the making of Santo Coffee Cubes, will get the product at less than future retail prices – and will be the first to be offered exclusive and premium perks, and limited edition flavors coming down the road. I love being an entrepreneur, but I love coffee even more—especially coffee cubes! I'm obsessed with marketing, customer experiences, and bringing a smile to consumers as well as the people who work behind of each of my projects.I have been in the digital marketing industry for more than 5 years, and my career has been focused on bringing new ideas or inventions involving craft and artisan-made techniques and how to market them to the entire world.With Santo Coffee Cubes, I am working with my team, my family, and experienced farmers to bring people around the world a simple and delicious coffee experience and to help families and children within the coffee fields to have a fair and better quality of life.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Like every good story, there has to be a beginning.  And as in all cases, there is one here.  However, if you’re reading this, you’ve joined us in the later chapters of it. Somewhere in chapter five actually.  There’s a lot to fill in, but we’re going to condense it to a single though per chapter (plus an introduction).</p>
<p>Intro: Picked up my dad’s old store-bought extract homebrew kit after four years in the Marine Corps and hated the result, causing me to decide to learn the real way to brew beer</p>
<p>Chapter 1: Began homebrewing in Reno, Nevada and found a real passion for it until I moved to Texas and downgraded from a house to an apartment, ceasing my brewing operations for the time being</p>
<p>Chapter 2: Met an amazing woman who listened to my crazy ideas of one day owning a brewery and she purchased me a new brewing kit for our first Christmas together which re-ignited the fire I felt for the craft</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Took that kit and built upon it, making my house fill up with bottles and brews and turned bottling into a full-on family affair that everyone partook in</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Introduced Todd, my partner, to the process of brewing and we hatched the actual plan to build a brewery including the purchase of 8 barrels of fermentation space, a single barrel brewing system, and a plethora of other equipment as we move towards opening</p>
<p>Chapter 5: In progress…</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>C.J. Gent – A Marine Corps veteran who served from 2005-2009.  Born and raised in Nevada, I moved to Texas after my military time to pursue career opportunities.  Hired on with Carrollton Police in 2014, it was there I met Todd and shortly after Todd’s retirement, I was promoted to Sergeant and oversee a patrol shift and the bike team.</p>
<p>Todd Burnside – A veteran of the U.S. Army also worked for Carrollton Police for over 20 years.  Todd recently retired from the department as a Sergeant and has begun working in the security field since. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Are</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Four Walls Brewing Company is built upon a concept that resonates with most people – that there is comfort in wherever you call home.  When we end a shift, when we get back from a business trip, when a service member returns home from a deployment or the completion of a contract, there is comfort there.  And within the Four Walls of home, you find peace.</p>
<p>Our beers are designed for the newcomer to the world of craft beers and the experienced craft beer drinker alike.  Many of our beers have mild flavors, designed not to overpower the palate but to entice it into more complex flavors.  Additionally, many of our beers have deep, complex, rich profiles that experienced drinkers enjoy and actively seek out to experience.</p>
<p>We are actively trying to move in to a property in Celina, TX, and we want to bring people together. Our plan is to be a small brewpub in Celina that will initially be open Friday-Sunday, with plans to expand our hours in the coming years. One of our main goals is to not only be part of a community, but to truly integrate into the community. When you come to Four Walls, we want the whole family to come.  Bring the kiddos, bring the pup. We don’t want you to take time away from your family to visit us.  Find comfort here in a good glass of beer while being surrounded by those you love.</p>
<p>Part of our goal, our campaign, our mission, is to be integral into our community.  We will, without question, give back to our community and to organizations that provide services to individuals in need.  As a 100% veteran owned company, our military members fall near and dear to our hearts. We feel strongly that there is a great demand placed on the young men and women of our great nation who sign up to serve, and it is our calling to be here for them when they get back. Equally, as two law enforcement officers, our brothers and sisters in blue (and yes, even red), mean a great deal to us as well.  We have selected organizations that help veterans and first responders that will receive donations from us.  It won’t stop there.  There are a number of other organizations that greatly impact our lives daily that we will support.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Support</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Since early 2018, we've been communicating with the Economic Development group in Celina, Texas regarding opening our brewpub up in their city.  From the beginning, the excitement and support was unrivaled.  We have been constantly communicating with the EDC regarding our progress, and they have been helpful every step of the way as we try to bring our beers to their city. From our first meeting with the employees of the city, Celina has felt like the perfect place for our brewery to call home.</p>
<p>At a local event in June of 2018, we were able to have the citizens sample our beers and provide real time feedback.  The response was wonderful and the conversations we had with the people were great. We even ended up snagging a great graphic designer who has proved to be irreplaceable (thanks, Ryan!) With our desire to be in Celina, and the overwhelmingly positive response to the beers everyone sampled, we had to find a place to set up.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Location</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>So we began our search right then and there.  Immediately, we found a little gas station a couple hundred feet from Celina Town Square that seemed to be perfect.  Built in the 1930's, it has the history of the town, an extremely unique feel, the space and setup we need.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Have/Need</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Here’s where we stand today.  We have chairs ready to go for the serving room, and we’re actively working on obtaining patio furniture for outside. With our single barrel system and eight barrels of fermentation space, that will provide us the opportunity to grow organically with the community and at a manageable pace.  We have a glycol chiller that can handle half of our vessels as it stands.  We recently ordered, and received, our initial glassware order of 16oz glasses, 5oz sample glasses, and 100 growlers for beer to go.</p>
<p>We are going to need another glycol chiller that can handle the full load of our fermenters, with the ability to add on additional fermenters.  This cost is approximately $5,000.  We will be building a walk-in cooler utilizing a CoolBot system, allowing us to customize the space from the beginning.  Estimated costs for this are roughly $1,500 - $2,000 for an 8’ x 8’x 12’ cooler.   These hard goods are required for us to get open and operational.</p>
<p>Additionally, we will have our TABC and TTB licensing to take care of. Without the appropriate paperwork completed, we can’t bring our beers to you. The process to begin obtaining our licenses can only begin once we establish a location and begin finishing out the interior.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Another Brewery??</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>With all the different breweries in the world right now, why another one? Why should I help open yet another manufacturer of beer? The question is fair. </p>
<p>We want to be a welcoming, comfortable place that provides a wide variety of beers for everyone's palate.  We will always keep up with the latest trends while maintaining the small town feel.  We want to produce something for everyone, and we believe that many breweries these days do not do that.  Four Walls doesn't want to alienate those who haven't found that craft beer they enjoy, but rather provide them with the craft beer they will learn to love.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Ultimately, the main challenge we will face is going to come from construction and rehabilitation costs of our building.  Originally built in the 1930's, our location is an old gas station that has seen some years and additions along the way.  The uniqueness is something we want to preserve, but in order to do that we anticipate some unforeseen costs as work progresses along.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p>At the end of the day, we know not everyone can help out.  And that is 100% understandable.  If you can't help out with a donation, we ask that you spread the word about what we're trying to bring to Celina. Ultimately, it is the generosity of those of you taking the time to read these words and watch our video that will help bring our dream to life.  And whether you live nearby or not, you will help build a place for friends, families, strangers, and loved ones to make memories that will be cherished for years to come.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div><p> </p><p>We will always strive to provide you the best beer possible, made with the finest ingredients and the most efficient practices.  We won’t cut corners because it’s something we simply don’t do. We will become part of a community, bringing people together and spreading the love and comfort that we craft. And when you come in, if the mood strikes you, we will have journals behind the bar yearning for your short stories to be penned.  Because at the end of the day, there’s a story in here somewhere.</p></div>","Introduction

Chapter 4: Introduced Todd, my partner, to the process of brewing and we hatched the actual plan to build a brewery including the purchase of 8 barrels of fermentation space, a single barrel brewing system, and a plethora of other equipment as we move towards opening
Chapter 5: In progress…
 
Who We Are
 
C.J. Gent – A Marine Corps veteran who served from 2005-2009.  Born and raised in Nevada, I moved to Texas after my military time to pursue career opportunities.  Hired on with Carrollton Police in 2014, it was there I met Todd and shortly after Todd’s retirement, I was promoted to Sergeant and oversee a patrol shift and the bike team.
Todd Burnside – A veteran of the U.S. Army also worked for Carrollton Police for over 20 years.  Todd recently retired from the department as a Sergeant and has begun working in the security field since. 
 
What We Are
 
Four Walls Brewing Company is built upon a concept that resonates with most people – that there is comfort in wherever you call home.  When we end a shift, when we get back from a business trip, when a service member returns home from a deployment or the completion of a contract, there is comfort there.  And within the Four Walls of home, you find peace.
Our beers are designed for the newcomer to the world of craft beers and the experienced craft beer drinker alike.  Many of our beers have mild flavors, designed not to overpower the palate but to entice it into more complex flavors.  Additionally, many of our beers have deep, complex, rich profiles that experienced drinkers enjoy and actively seek out to experience.
We are actively trying to move in to a property in Celina, TX, and we want to bring people together. Our plan is to be a small brewpub in Celina that will initially be open Friday-Sunday, with plans to expand our hours in the coming years. One of our main goals is to not only be part of a community, but to truly integrate into the community. When you come to Four Walls, we want the whole family to come.  Bring the kiddos, bring the pup. We don’t want you to take time away from your family to visit us.  Find comfort here in a good glass of beer while being surrounded by those you love.
Part of our goal, our campaign, our mission, is to be integral into our community.  We will, without question, give back to our community and to organizations that provide services to individuals in need.  As a 100% veteran owned company, our military members fall near and dear to our hearts. We feel strongly that there is a great demand placed on the young men and women of our great nation who sign up to serve, and it is our calling to be here for them when they get back. Equally, as two law enforcement officers, our brothers and sisters in blue (and yes, even red), mean a great deal to us as well.  We have selected organizations that help veterans and first responders that will receive donations from us.  It won’t stop there.  There are a number of other organizations that greatly impact our lives daily that we will support.
 
Support
 
Since early 2018, we've been communicating with the Economic Development group in Celina, Texas regarding opening our brewpub up in their city.  From the beginning, the excitement and support was unrivaled.  We have been constantly communicating with the EDC regarding our progress, and they have been helpful every step of the way as we try to bring our beers to their city. From our first meeting with the employees of the city, Celina has felt like the perfect place for our brewery to call home.
At a local event in June of 2018, we were able to have the citizens sample our beers and provide real time feedback.  The response was wonderful and the conversations we had with the people were great. We even ended up snagging a great graphic designer who has proved to be irreplaceable (thanks, Ryan!) With our desire to be in Celina, and the overwhelmingly positive response to the beers everyone sampled, we had to find a place to set up.
 
Location
 
So we began our search right then and there.  Immediately, we found a little gas station a couple hundred feet from Celina Town Square that seemed to be perfect.  Built in the 1930's, it has the history of the town, an extremely unique feel, the space and setup we need.
 
What We Have/Need
 
Here’s where we stand today.  We have chairs ready to go for the serving room, and we’re actively working on obtaining patio furniture for outside. With our single barrel system and eight barrels of fermentation space, that will provide us the opportunity to grow organically with the community and at a manageable pace.  We have a glycol chiller that can handle half of our vessels as it stands.  We recently ordered, and received, our initial glassware order of 16oz glasses, 5oz sample glasses, and 100 growlers for beer to go.
We are going to need another glycol chiller that can handle the full load of our fermenters, with the ability to add on additional fermenters.  This cost is approximately $5,000.  We will be building a walk-in cooler utilizing a CoolBot system, allowing us to customize the space from the beginning.  Estimated costs for this are roughly $1,500 - $2,000 for an 8’ x 8’x 12’ cooler.   These hard goods are required for us to get open and operational.
Additionally, we will have our TABC and TTB licensing to take care of. Without the appropriate paperwork completed, we can’t bring our beers to you. The process to begin obtaining our licenses can only begin once we establish a location and begin finishing out the interior.
 

Why Another Brewery??
 
With all the different breweries in the world right now, why another one? Why should I help open yet another manufacturer of beer? The question is fair. 
We want to be a welcoming, comfortable place that provides a wide variety of beers for everyone's palate.  We will always keep up with the latest trends while maintaining the small town feel.  We want to produce something for everyone, and we believe that many breweries these days do not do that.  Four Walls doesn't want to alienate those who haven't found that craft beer they enjoy, but rather provide them with the craft beer they will learn to love.
 


Challenges
 
Ultimately, the main challenge we will face is going to come from construction and rehabilitation costs of our building.  Originally built in the 1930's, our location is an old gas station that has seen some years and additions along the way.  The uniqueness is something we want to preserve, but in order to do that we anticipate some unforeseen costs as work progresses along.
 
Other Ways You Can Help
 

At the end of the day, we know not everyone can help out.  And that is 100% understandable.  If you can't help out with a donation, we ask that you spread the word about what we're trying to bring to Celina. Ultimately, it is the generosity of those of you taking the time to read these words and watch our video that will help bring our dream to life.  And whether you live nearby or not, you will help build a place for friends, families, strangers, and loved ones to make memories that will be cherished for years to come.

 We will always strive to provide you the best beer possible, made with the finest ingredients and the most efficient practices.  We won’t cut corners because it’s something we simply don’t do. We will become part of a community, bringing people together and spreading the love and comfort that we craft. And when you come in, if the mood strikes you, we will have journals behind the bar yearning for your short stories to be penned.  Because at the end of the day, there’s a story in here somewhere.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Salut, </p>
<p>(texte en Français plus bas)</p>
<p>We are Midnight Poutine! For those who never heard of us, we're a Burning Man food camp from the french speaking province of Canada called Quebec.  Since 2009, we've been driving <strong>10 000 km</strong> (6 200 miles) to Black Rock City, NV, to serve poutines to very hungry and eager burners at -surprise- midnight.</p>
<p>But what's poutine?  It's a traditional Quebecois comfort food usually (but not always) eaten after a night of drinking. It’s made from french fries and cheese curds (what is called in Quebecois ""cheese droppings "" ). The whole thing covered with thick brown sauce from ancient family recipes.  After a full day of drinking and partying on the playa this simple dish will blow you away!</p>
<p>Last year, <strong>2000</strong> <strong>hungry burners</strong> got a taste of Midnight Poutine. It's a party every night with Québecois music, a burn barrel, sexy people, line-ups around the block, an open-mic stage to entertain the line-up and, of course, poutine! We don't want to leave anybody hungry at BRC :)  </p>
<p>We need your contributions for :</p>
<p><strong>Cheese curds </strong>: Hell yeah, we use REAL cheese curds!  Without cheese we would just have fries and sauce, and we all know how boring that would be.  And it turns out that cheese curds are our biggest expense!!!</p>
<p><strong>The other Ingredients</strong> : This include potatoes, gravy,  and oil  and there's a lot propane to feed our trusty 6 fryers.</p>
<p><strong>The other Logistics</strong> : It takes a lot to set up a food camp, make eating areas, an open-mic stage and decorations, not to mention getting all this stuff to Burning Man from Montreal and renting a storage locker year-round in Reno, NV, for all our other stuff.  'nuff said.  </p>
<p>It cost about <strong>5000$</strong> to serve about 2000 poutines and this excludes our camp's expenses. Some of the financing is done through fundraising events and by us. So that means ALL the money you contribute goes toward running the poutine kitchen! The more money we get, the more poutines we have the pleasure to serve, it's that simple.</p>
<p>Please help us feed our fellow burners in 2017 by funding the best late-night party food camp on the playa.  Thank you all!</p>

<p>Bonjour à tous,</p>
<p>Nous sommes Midnight Poutine,  un camp de Montréal qui depuis 2009 parcourt <strong>10 000 km</strong> aller-retour pour se rendre au festival Burning Man au Nevada. Tous les soirs à minuit sur la ""playa"", nous offrons de la poutine à nos compatriotes festivaliers (ou ""burners"").</p>
<p>Qu’est-ce que la poutine? Il s’agit d’un plat typiquement québécois composé de patates frites et de fromage en grain, communément appelé ""crottes de fromage"", le tout nappé d’une sauce dont la recette est un secret familial bien gardé.  Après une journée complète de fête et de boisson, le goût de nos poutines va faire littéralement ""capoter"" tous les burners.</p>
<p>L’an passé, nous avons offert <strong>2000 poutines</strong> à des burners affamés qui étaient prêt à attendre des heures pour goûter à notre petit plat typique de fin-de-brosse.  Ça devient une fête improvisée a tous les soirs avec de la grosse musique Québécoise, du beau monde sexy, un baril de feu, une immense file d'attente, une scène ouverte ou les gens peuvent monter et divertir ceux qui attendent en ligne et, bien sûr, d'la poutiiiiiiiine!</p>
<p>Nous avons besoin de vos contributions pour : </p>
<p><strong>Les crottes de fromage </strong>: Eh oui, le fromage est sans contredit notre dépense la plus coûteuse mais sans fromage ça ne serait qu’une frite-sauce et on sait bien que c’est plate une frite-sauce.</p>
<p><strong>Les autres ingrédients</strong> : Cela inclut les patates, la sauce, l’huile et aussi le gaz propane pour alimenter nos 6 friteuses adorées.</p>
<p><strong>Les autres logistiques</strong> : À chaque année, nous devons construire notre camp, nos deux cuisines (publique et privée),  la scéne ""open-mic"" sans compter le transport de notre matériel en camion à partir de Montréal jusqu’à la playa et la location à l'année d'un espace d'entreposage pour le reste de notre stock à Reno, NV. Soyez certains que tout l'argent ramassé servira uniquement aux besoins culinaires de Midnight Poutine.</p>Il nous en coûte environ<strong> 5000$</strong> pour servir 2000 poutines et ceci exclut les dépenses de notre campement. Une bonne partie de notre financement est faite grâce à des événements locaux en plus de nos propres contributions. Ainsi, TOUTES les sommes que nous collecterons dans cette campagne serviront uniquement à financer la cuisine.  Plus nous amasserons d'argent, plus de poutines nous aurons le plaisir de servir sur la playa. C'est aussi simple que ça.<br/> <p>Nous vous remercions de bien vouloir nous aider à répéter l’expérience encore une fois cette année. C'est grâce à vous que Midnight Poutine devient un lieu incontournable pour commencer sa soirée à Burning Man 2017. Un gros merci à tous!! </p>

The Aerator instills the proper amount of air for your wine as you pour, instantly. The Smart Wine Aerator has been designed to be easy to use, ergonomic and intuitive. Personalize The Aerator can also be used without the app, allowing you to personalize the aeration time directly on the touch screen of the Aerator. As the oxygen is added to the wine as you pour, the wine in the bottle is not touched, allowing you and your guests to have fun trying out different levels of aeration and exploring new tastes!From the very beginning of its adventure, Aveine, under the guidance of Julien Dussert (voted the best young sommelier in France!) has involved sommeliers, restaurateurs and wine lovers to taste, test, and validate the use of the Smart Wine Aerator.Users download a free smartphone app that is used to control the Aveine Smart Wine Aerator. After scanning the label on the bottle, the wine is identified by pulling from a database and using Artificial Intelligence, then pairs with the Aerator to calibrate it to that wine’s ideal level of aeration.The feature-rich app is free, easy to use, interactive and educational, and offers winetasting tips from sommeliers, oenologists, winegrowers and other members of the Aveine community.The Aerator can also be used without the app, allowing users to have fun trying out different levels of aeration.The packaging has been designed to endure, facilitate and secure the transport of the Smart Wine Aerator.More than 5,000 hours of research and development were needed to develop the Aveine Aerator.

Furthermore, with our current and future productions we continue to aim towards using local raw materials as much as possible for not only hops &amp; grain but additional ingredients like wild type yeast.

<p style=""text-align: center;"">In the summer of 2015, the dream of Asgard entered the conversation as founding members John and Stephen Porter had a glass of beer in the historic Michigan Brewery Frankenmuth, a destination the pair  had made a frequent haunt over the years. After contacting a friend in the brewing business, John with his knowledge of beer and branding coupled with Steve and his knowledge of business and planning set out to to make Asgard a reality. At the beginning it was a rocky road but fueled by John’s once middle school dream to own a bar themed around his heritage the two set off and met with Ryan Whitaker, after several brewing sessions, the three became friends and partners realizing that they created a dynamic team, each with a different but vital set of skills: with Steve as a long time business owner, Ryan as a brewer, and John as a graphic designer, of course one major thing also tied them all together and that was the love of beer. Public interest began to grow almost immediately and within months Asgard was accepting invitations to attend tasting and charity events and festivals. The future looks extremely bright for Asgard Brewing and the guys look forward to pursuing their passion of brewing great beer and seeking opportunities to positively impact their neighbors and visitors alike.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">One aspect we're excited about &amp; extremely proud of is our farm-to-barrel initiative. To this day, there is not a one defining aspect of Viking beer other than they used what was locally available.

<h3>A Sequential Plan</h3>
<p>A coffee company based on comic books? Yes, sort of.</p>
<p>“SEQUENTIAL” is a reference to the design style that is most frequently encountered in comics and graphic novels: sequential art. Frame to frame, each illustration conveys a sequence of the artist’s vision. In between each frame is a space referred to as the ""ditch"". The ditch is an empty space where the reader is free to fill in the details intuitively. It happens without thinking. It happens subconsciously. And it brings the reader along in the creative process.</p>
<p>What happens in the ditch is equally important to what happens in the frame, because it’s in those empty spaces that the reader PARTICIPATES in the experience and makes it their own.  </p>
<p>Stories are what bring us together. And so yes, in that way we are a coffee company based on comic books. Just like the ‘ditch’ in comics, coffee brings people of all backgrounds, ethnicities and cultures together in that third place that we all subconsciously seek between frames.</p>

<p>SEQUENTIAL COFFEE presents the world's finest coffees, responsibly sourced and thoughtfully roasted to let the coffee speak for itself. Our mission is to celebrate the coffee at each step in its journey from the farm to the cup, to elevate and highlight its individual qualities to provide you with a memorable specialty coffee experience.</p>
<p>We are Stephen Ezell and Jonathan Shepard. Together we created Sequential Coffee, based in Jacksonville Florida. </p>
<p>A little over a year ago, armed with a solid business plan and small investment, we began formulating our coffee offerings to bring to market. We surrounded ourselves with industry leaders and advisors to help shape and test the viability of our brand. We took our first step by partnering with another roaster to form a small co-roast facility. In February of 2020, Sequential Coffee officially began offering our product online. </p>
<p>We focused our efforts on two objectives; to expand our offerings, and to focus on opening our own brick and mortar cafe. Just as we were all set to open our first retail kiosk cafe on April 2, 2020, which we had planned 9 months earlier, the global Covid-19 pandemic changed those plans. We had to adjust.  So we did...</p>
<ul>
<li>We scaled up and enhanced our online store, hired a digital marketing director and focused on getting great coffee to people at home.  </li>
<li>We launched Sequential Points to reward customer for buying our coffee online and for sharing that experience with others.</li>
<li>We launched a subscription program to allow frequent buyers to create their own experience and have coffee automatically delivered on their own schedule.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to wide reception by coffee lovers like you, our sales increased. We adjusted to the curves in our path and survived to arrive here today.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; Where it will go?</h3>
<p>We are now days away from opening that Kiosk Cafe at St. Johns Town Center here in Jacksonville. With a safe opening and relative success, our long term goal is to replicate this small footprint model in key cities across the Southeast US.</p>
<ul>
<li>We want to open the first zero-carbon emission roasting facility in Southeast.<br/>Today we’re already near full capacity with our co-roast facility and are working to expand our shared coffee laboratory by procuring a larger roasting machine to scale our responsible production capabilities.</li>
<li>Cold coffee based concoctions are at the center of our model. We have developed the recipes and aim to go into production both in served-to-order at the kiosk and canned grab-and-go offerings by end of year 2020.</li>
<li>We are bringing on a National Account manager to direct our wholesale program with large retail chains - so <i>you</i> can buy it in your home town market.</li>
<li>We are looking for key regional sales associates and ambassadors with a passion for specialty coffee, to expand our cafe and hospitality clients, so you can enjoy it at <i>your</i> favorite cafe or getaway, nationwide.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are seeking $40,000 to scale our roasting operation to meet our expected growth in sales, to bring on a national account wholesale manager and underwrite expenses related to these scaling efforts.  Reaching this goal does not ""cover"" those costs, but allows us to seed revenue generating initiatives and the infrastructure to support those initiatives. These in turn, become profitable and, as costs of production are reduced, allows these initiatives to pay for themselves, ongoing.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>As always, the best way for us to grow is to sell our delicious coffee.  And we would not ask more of our contributors than we would ask of ourselves. This ask mirrors our personal investment to date.</p>
<p>So for each donation we are sending you the world's finest coffee, handcrafted, responsibly sourced and thoughtfully roasted for a memorable specialty coffee experience.  And once you taste it, you will want to share it with others.  Which is what the coffee experience is really all about.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When you contribute you'll be helping a local small business:</p>
<ul>
<li>Employ, train, and sustain people whose passion is making great coffee experiences come to life.</li>
<li>Grow to a point where we can bring our approach to the coffee experience even closer to your home</li>
<li>Support a company whose values are all about inclusiveness and sharing in the profitability in our industry with everyone in the process from the farm to the cup.</li>
<li>Educate a generation of others who can take this knowledge and build a career or even another small business for themselves.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Risks and challenges still exist.  They always will in business. But as we've shared above, we have ALL been challenged in unexpected ways. And here at Sequential we've made those adjustments to the best of our ability to have come this far.  This resilience will serve us well as we navigate the path ahead.  Sequentially, of course</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visit our <a href=""https://sequential.coffee/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">online store</a> and shop at your leisure. </li>
<li>Join Sequential points and get rewarded immediately for joining and even more when you help spread the word.</li>
<li>Use the Indiegogo share tools to get our message to your own network!  That will help us reach our goal.</li>

Now is the beginning of the future of food!</p></div>","The 2050 Smoothie is the world's first instant smoothie made from upcycled produce. Imagine taking eveything you love about your daily fruit smoothie and making it more convenient, nutritious, and sustainable. That's The 2050 Smoothie! Always running out of frozen fruit? The 2050 Smoothie has every ingredient you need in one convenient and reusable package! Brown bananas and wilted spinach? The 2050 Smoothie stays fresh in your pantry for up to a year! No freezer necessary! Running late for work? The 2050 Smoothie transforms into a delicious frozen beverage in under 60 seconds! Trying to reduce your carbon footprint? The 2050 Smoothie is made from imperfect and surplus produce, and is shipped to your door 100% carbon neutrally! Three signature flavors inspired by the Northwest! The 2050 Smoothie is a 100% natural, instant smoothie powder available in 3 delicious, Northwest-inspired flavors: Rainier Berry, Seattle Summer, and Evergreen.The only ingredients are real fruits and vegetables. Zero added sweeteners. Zero preservatives.  Our innovative drying technology locks in all flavor and nutrients while extending shelf-life from days to a year. Simply blend The 2050 Smoothie with ice and your favorite liquid base to transform it into a refreshing, earth-friendly treat! Scientists predict that by 2050:
 90% of coral reefs will be gone
 50% more acreage will burn in wildfires
 20% of tropical rainforests will disappear
And 100% of Arctic ice will have melted
These predictions will only come true if we do nothing today.  The 2050 Company was formed around a single, focused mission - to ensure a brighter future by 2050. A future-focused company must remain both realistic and optimistic. That means facing facts, no matter how daunting, and exploring solutions, no matter how ambitious. It also means, focusing on the best solutions first...  Project Drawdown is a coalition of scientists, activists, and business people that keeps a live ranking of the best solutions to preventing global warming of 2 ºC by 2050.  In terms of impact and feasibility, reducing food waste outranks plant-based diets (#3), solar power (#8), and electric cars (#24). Need we say more? Scientists predict that global food production will have to increase between 25% and 75% by 2050 to meet the demands of a growing population. This sounds daunting, but there is hope. There is already enough food grown on farms to feed almost 10 billion people. Maybe the solution to this problem isn't simply producing more food, but making sure the food we produce today doesn't go to waste. The 2050 Company was founded around a radical idea: selecting the Future as the key stakeholder in every decision we make. We make food for the future. The future of food is more whole foods and less additives. It's longer shelf life with zero preservatives. And it's convenient and quick, to keep up with the busy lives of modern day change-makers. The 2050 Smoothie is food for the future of you. The future of food is sustainable. It's unwanted produce upcycled into delicious smoothies. It's free of single-use packaging. And it's light enough to ship across the country with minimal carbon impact. The 2050 Smoothie is food for the future of Earth.We believe that real food doesn't have ingredients, real food is ingredients. The future of food isn's packed with preservatives, sweeteners, or fillers. Our ingredient list tells you everything you need to know. The only ingredients in The 2050 Smoothie are real fruits and vegetables. Nothing else.  We achieve a 1-year shelf life with technology, not chemicals and preservatives. Our unique drying process removes all water from fruits and vegetables, and leaves all nutrients and flavor intact. It's just like fresh or frozen fruit, but it doesn't go bad and it takes up a tiny bit of space in your pantry instead of an entire shelf in your freezer!Our founder, Austin, has made a smoothie every day for the past 5 years...and kind of hated it. The packed freezer. The plastic bags of fruit. The melted berries covering hands and staining clothes. There had to be a better way! The 2050 Smoothie is not only healthy, but convenient. It's simultaneously all-inclusive and endlessly customizable: Want a quick, refreshing smoothie? everything you need is in the bag! Just throw some ice, water, and 2050 Smoothie powder in the blender and you're off to the races? Want a smoothie on the go? Just shake up The 2050 Smoothie with water in a BlenderBottle? Want a meal replacement? Just add some protein powder or greek yogurt to the mix!  If you're a fancy smoothie type of person, just remember this formula: The 2050 Smoothie + Ice = Frozen Fruit. Now you can sub The 2050 Smoothie into all your favorite recipes and save some time!  Still wondering how The 2050 Smoothie tastes? Don't just take our word for it! On May 2nd, we launched a 20 hour and 50 minute virtual pop-up sale. In less than a day, we completely sold out - delivering almost 1,000 smoothies to customers and another 100 to healthcare workers! Here's what some of our customers had to say after trying their first 2050 Smoothie: Today, 40% percent of all food produced in the United States is never eaten.

<h2 style=""""> </h2>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;""> </p>
<p>I discovered stevia almost 6 years ago.  It's very sweet and I enjoy having it in my coffee and knowing that it's good for me.  It is a very strong antioxidant, a mild steroid, has no digestive side effects.  And, it is almost calorie free.  In my effort to reduce sugar and calories in my diet I started using stevia as a replacement for sugar in many recipes.  Friends have asked me to share these recipes and there has been a very encouraging response, and many requests for recipes.  I feel that my health has been positively affected by stevia.  The collection of recipes that I have developed using stevia is extensive.  I've heard friends who are aware of stevia comment that they would like to know how to use it in something ""other than coffee"".  I also have friends looking for healthy alternatives to sugar and artificial sweeteners like Splenda, Equal, saccharine, aspartame, etc.; which are all known carcinogens. </p>

<p>I am raising money to publish my recipes and develop an informational website on how to use stevia, it's benefits, and how healthy lifestyle choices can help all of us promote a healthier society and  fight diabetes.  We all have a cravings for sweet taste and can avoid satisfying this craving for sugar or fat-filled foods. Even ""natural"" sugar substitutes, such as honey, maple syrup or molasses, can be unhealthy if over-consumed since they can markedly elevate blood sugar levels. Hence, stevia can be advantageous to practically everyone whose diet contains sweets.  Stevia can be helpful to anyone, and there are certain groups who are more likely to benefit from its remarkable sweetening potential. These include diabetics, those interested in decreasing caloric intake, and children. </p>

<p>I am raising money to publish my recipes and develop an informational website on how to use stevia.  We will explain its benefits, how it is produced, the best form to buy, etc.  As well as, how healthy lifestyle choices can help all of us promote a healthier society, fight diabetes, and fight obesity.  We all have a craving for sweet taste and can avoid satisfying this craving with sugar or fat-filled foods. Even ""natural"" sugar substitutes, such as honey, maple syrup or molasses, can be unhealthy if over-consumed since they can markedly elevate blood sugar levels.  Stevia can be advantageous to practically everyone.  However, there are certain groups who are more likely to benefit from its remarkable sweetening potential. These include diabetics, those interested in decreasing caloric intake, people with high blood pressure, and children. </p>
<p>I hope that you will help me generate and distribute a cookbook of easy recipes to promote the benefit of knowing how to use this wonderful sweet sugar substitute.</p>

</div></div>","Our Story
 
 
I discovered stevia almost 6 years ago.  It's very sweet and I enjoy having it in my coffee and knowing that it's good for me.  It is a very strong antioxidant, a mild steroid, has no digestive side effects.  And, it is almost calorie free.  In my effort to reduce sugar and calories in my diet I started using stevia as a replacement for sugar in many recipes.  Friends have asked me to share these recipes and there has been a very encouraging response, and many requests for recipes.  I feel that my health has been positively affected by stevia.  The collection of recipes that I have developed using stevia is extensive.  I've heard friends who are aware of stevia comment that they would like to know how to use it in something ""other than coffee"".  I also have friends looking for healthy alternatives to sugar and artificial sweeteners like Splenda, Equal, saccharine, aspartame, etc.; which are all known carcinogens. 
 
I am raising money to publish my recipes and develop an informational website on how to use stevia, it's benefits, and how healthy lifestyle choices can help all of us promote a healthier society and  fight diabetes.  We all have a cravings for sweet taste and can avoid satisfying this craving for sugar or fat-filled foods. Even ""natural"" sugar substitutes, such as honey, maple syrup or molasses, can be unhealthy if over-consumed since they can markedly elevate blood sugar levels. Hence, stevia can be advantageous to practically everyone whose diet contains sweets.  Stevia can be helpful to anyone, and there are certain groups who are more likely to benefit from its remarkable sweetening potential. These include diabetics, those interested in decreasing caloric intake, and children. 
 
I am raising money to publish my recipes and develop an informational website on how to use stevia.  We will explain its benefits, how it is produced, the best form to buy, etc.  As well as, how healthy lifestyle choices can help all of us promote a healthier society, fight diabetes, and fight obesity.  We all have a craving for sweet taste and can avoid satisfying this craving with sugar or fat-filled foods. Even ""natural"" sugar substitutes, such as honey, maple syrup or molasses, can be unhealthy if over-consumed since they can markedly elevate blood sugar levels.  Stevia can be advantageous to practically everyone.  However, there are certain groups who are more likely to benefit from its remarkable sweetening potential. These include diabetics, those interested in decreasing caloric intake, people with high blood pressure, and children. 
I hope that you will help me generate and distribute a cookbook of easy recipes to promote the benefit of knowing how to use this wonderful sweet sugar substitute.

 
 
The Impact
Change the thought process of sugar addicts to use stevia as a healthy alternative.

<p><i>The Secret Drinks Club</i> is here to bring you a completely new, exciting and interactive drinks experience! For our first edition of The Secret Drinks Club we've worked with an exciting and unique spiced rum brand to bring you on a journey of discovery. </p>
<p>We (Matt and Max) founded <i>The Secret Drinks Club</i> out of the frustration that there are hundreds (if not thousands) of exciting and interesting drinks brands out there which consumers like us have no knowledge of. </p>
<p>These brands have spirits and drinks which taste incredible and we never know about them because they don’t sell through supermarkets and we are unlikely to find them in the mass of online sellers. The big secret? There is way more to the drinks industry than meets the eye....</p>
<p>That’s where we come in.</p>
<p><i>The Secret Drinks Club</i> is not a boujie, hipster, old boys club from the 1950s! And if we're honest we don’t really know what ‘craft’ and ‘artisan’ drinks are.. other than more expensive! We're a small company that is passionate about introducing people to exciting new, small or niche spirits. More importantly, we want to connect you directly to the brands so you experience it the way they intended!</p>
<p><strong>So what do I get in The Rum Edition?</strong></p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/484814148?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div> <p><strong>This unique gift box will include....</strong></p>

<p>- An exclusive and interactive guided experience with Pete (our Rum expert!) who'll introduce you to the brand, the drink, its heritage and most importantly, how to enjoy it!</p>
<p>- Tasting masterclass and three new ways to enjoy the spirit</p>
<p>- Professional standard Boston cocktail shaker set </p>
<p>- A range of mixers to create some wonderful drinks</p>
<p>- A few surprises (well, we are The Secret Drinks Club after all)</p>
<p>- All presented in a gift box suitable for everyone from your mum to your boss!</p>
</div><div>
<p>There's so much out there for you and we want to connect you to it. Across all the categories in the spirits business there will be a box for you.

<p><u><strong>Summary</strong></u></p>
<p>Even though I started this bakery at the ripe old age of 17 in 2011, we did not become an allergen friendly bakery until 2015. What made us change? In 2014 while walking out of a freezer, I fell, fracturing my neck, blacking out and having a seizure. For almost a month during recovery I broke out in hives every day. I was told at the time that it was a gluten and dairy allergy. The entire time that I gave up those allergens, I didn’t feel normal. I couldn’t go out, I was stressed and terrified to eat out anywhere. After a month I found out that my allergies are to opiates, however I knew that I needed to help others who can’t ever just go out to eat and feel like a normal person.</p>
<p>To date we have served over 19,000 people. Among those people about 75% have food allergies, usually more than one, and would find it extremely difficult to eat out. If they did find a place to go either they had one or two options or had to worry about cross contamination in the kitchen or the establishment not knowing how to handle allergies/ or what vegan means. With us, you don’t have to worry and you will spend most of your time trying to figure out what to get because everything is safe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>What We Need &amp; Why We are Crowd Funding</strong></u></p>
<p>We need to raise an additional $10,000 on top of what we have already saved up in order to build out our storefront.</p>
<p>Unfortunately taking out a loan for the business is not an option due to paying for college with credit cards. Which was the only way for me to be able to go to college. Thankfully all debt has been paid off but only time will help my score.</p>
<p>We have been approached by a handful of investors. Trying to find someone that is aligned with the business’ values and our mission is difficult, and after working so hard for the last eight years, I really don’t want to sell part of my business.</p>
<p><u><strong>The Impact</strong></u></p>
<p>By expanding to Worcester, we will be able to reach even more customers that are unable to commute to Boston, but also our regulars now that make that trek from CT, NY, and western MA that can only visit once a week or month because of how far Boston is.</p>
<p>We this larger location, we will also be able to offer more vegan and allergen friendly cooking classes, and gatherings at our shop as well as being able to keep up with demand with the larger kitchen.</p>
<p>Even if you can’t donate, just my sharing our campaign with your network will help us so much!!! With your support we can make so many kids feel normal again!!!!</p>

The act of cooking for others is my language of love, and has been a source of connection with people all around the world. My favourite way to eat involves big feasts with lots of people around the table. During the past few years, my cooking has has centred on cooking for my share house. We share much of our food communally, to reduce waste and energy consumption, to save money, and for the love of sharing meals together.</p><p><i>Shared Table</i> is a celebration of sharing food, but also of shared living and dear friendships. The book is photographed in friends' share houses across Meanjin (Brisbane). I want this book to be an ode to shared living and eating, for the images to evoke feelings of warmth and connection. I want them to capture the joy that is sitting around a table with your family or your mates, over a lovely home-cooked meal, drinking and chatting.</p><p>The recipes are all vegetarian, with lots of vegan options, and an emphasis on low waste and sustainability. I choose not to cook meat, because of its impact on our environment, and because it is the single most effective way that an individual can reduce their carbon footprint. Even if you're a meat eater, I think that you will love these recipes, and that they'll provide a source of encouragement to eat more meat free meals.</p><p>My food is designed to be budget-friendly, leftovers-friendly, flexible and above all, delicious. Ultimately, Shared Table is a food-sharing bible- the thing to consult when you’re cooking for a crowd, or are asked to bring a dish to share. The recipes can, of course, be used individually, but there are no big plates and tiny portions of perfectly arranged food here. It is serve-yourself fare; a celebration of sharing good food with those you love.</p><p>I am also conscious of what it means to be able to experience cooking in this way; there is immense privilege inherent in having the time and resources to cook for fun and pleasure. I want to be clear that I'm embarking on this project not to make profit, but to materialise some of my thoughts on sharing food, and really just to put some more yum and nice things into the world, of which I think we can never have too many.</p><p> </p><h2>Who's Involved?</h2><p>Making this book a reality will involve the help of so many dear people, too many to list here. Already I have had a number of friends and family reach out, offering their skills, time, support and most importantly, taste-testing services.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><span>We are one of the first chocolatiers in the country to obtain a wine license; constantly becoming educated in wine trends; and developing one-of-a-kind food, chocolate and wine pairings and gifts. Sher Bliss focuses on the ""wine &amp; chocolate experience"" by developing innovative products and personalized quality customer service for their guests. </span></p>
<p><span>Bliss in a Bottle is a chocolate-covered bottle of wine. The bottle is in a food grade sleeve, the chocolate is hand painted on, the message tag has instructions for neatly separating the chocolate from the wine, and you can enjoy both separately or simultaneously!  Bliss in a Bottle mall kiosks are opening to give the consumer an exciting chocolate-wrapped gift. If it is wine, we create the perfect marriage of these two delicacies. The chocolate cover can be deliciously paired to what is in the bottle and can be sampled at the kiosks’ tasting bar. We create the perfect taste profile through an avid devotion and expertise in sourcing wines that pair with chocolates and wines developed exclusively by winemakers from around the world for the Bliss in a Bottle brand. The chocolate we use is Premium Belgian milk and dark and white with a high cocoa butter content. Inclusions and infusions of other confectionary items are also of the highest quality.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Setting us apart from our competitors is the following:</b></span></p>
<p>• Tasting permit for the kiosk in malls and airports in the state of Ohio</p>
<p>• Idea: dipping everything for widest appeal possible (disguise a gift in<br/>chocolate!). Not relying solely on the wine customer – every gift can be a BIB<br/>experience. Empty bottles of varying sizes can house any gift. Customers can<br/>bring us their purchases from within the mall; white chocolate can be quickly<br/>colored and applied to a custom glass in varying sizes and decorated for<br/>gift-giving. Since very little gift wrap is available in stores, this makes for an<br/>exciting and consumable gift wrap and a big surprise for the recipient.</p>
<p>• Patents: apply for patents for two processes I have developed. One involves innovations in speed and the other involves innovative ways to comply with liquor laws. This makes Bliss in a Bottle saleable/accessable to other wine or chocolate shops.</p>
<p>• Kosher Wines: there were upwards of $28,000,000.00 in Kosher wine sales in 2010, and it’s growing at approx 15% per year. There are 12,100,000 Kosher consumers in the U.S. Sher Bliss is under the supervision of Buckey Kosher, enablish us to deliver Pareve Bliss in a Bottle for Kosher consumers across the country. </p>

<h3>Who is RPG?</h3>
<p>Real People Giving is a veteran owned and operated business.  Chris and Kelli Capozzoli are based out of Massachusetts, and Nathan and Jennifer France are based out of Minnesota.  These 2 couples have combined forces to create RPG.  Chris Capozzoli, one of RPG's co-owners and CEO's, served in the United States Air Force for 6 years as a Nuclear Weapons Specialists.  Nathan France, RPG's other co-owner and CEO, as well as Jennifer, are military parents. Their son, Matthew, is currently active duty in the US Army.  </p>
<p>We are proud partners of the Chris Kyle Frog Foundation (CKFF,) a nonprofit organization created by the late Chris Kyle's wife, Taya Kyle, in honor of her husband.  Our current goal is to raise enough money to support military/first responder families to utilize their fantastic services.</p>
<p>An excerpt off of the CKFF website: ""The Chris Kyle Frog Foundation’s (CKFF) vision for programming is one that is strategic, collaborative, and evidence-based. Since our organization was founded, we’ve developed an extensive network and well-rounded resources. CKFF’s unique and innovative programs have proven effective in keeping service marriages together, strengthening the family, as well as having a ripple effect on communities and future generations. Our long-term vision includes programs that help build stronger relationships between military and first responder marriages, as well as the communities in which they live and serve.""</p>
<p>RPG's mission is to impact as many first responder and military families as we can.  50% of our net profits are donated amongst this community, which in many ways is under funded and under supported.  Our partnership with CKFF is another way to accomplish this goal.  Our previous donation efforts have proudly helped fund a Veteran's family home for new heating and cooling systems, as well as a new gym facility at Eagle's Healing Nest, a Veteran residential home who houses Veterans during times of healing from Invisible Illnesses.  </p>
<p>This is where our RPG Warriors come in!  With your contribution on this page, RPG and CFKK can put another family through their incredible program.  If you choose to purchase our ""featured"" perk on the right side of this page, you can receive our instant Super Coffee.  You'll experience the health benefits of this coffee along with the satisfaction of helping this population of people who have given so much to our communities.  Explore other perks or simply donate whatever you are comfortable with. </p>

<h3>What Is Super Coffee?</h3>
<p>Super Coffee is sold in boxes of 32 individual single-serve sticks of our instant coffee.  Boxes are available at $46 each.  Our coffee is made up of premium Arabica beans sustainably grown in Colombia on a family farm that has operated for three generations.  Acemannan is added to our coffee blend to optimize your health with each consumption, which is where Super Coffee got its name!  Acemannan is powdered Aloe Vera extract, from the middle of the leaf.  Benefits include improved gut health, immune support, anti-inflammatory and wound healing effects, and much more.  Research is in abundance on this fantastic ingredient!</p>

<h3>Why RPG?</h3>
<p>RPG's goal is to start a ripple effect that benefits the Colombian community in which our coffee is grown, the customers who consume our Super Coffee, and the service members who receive our donations.  Since a year ago we have been able to help families with heating systems and contribute to a full CrossFit gym built for veterans.  We are grateful for the lives we have impacted, but this is only the beginning!  With your help, we can continue with this growth to help CKFF families.</p>
<p>Chris and Nathan recently returned from a trip to Colombia where they were fortunate enough to watch our coffee being created in stages, from the farm to factory to packaging.  Some of these experiences can be see documented in our videos!​  Not only do Chris and Nathan want to build a successful business, but the sustainable way our product is grown and created is especially important. </p>
