</div> <div> <h3>Why Healing Gardens?<br/>
</h3>The Healing Gardens fund was established to honour the wishes of Mary Eagan (1947--1992), who asked that any monies raised in her honor be directed towards building patios for 
future patients' well-being during their times of receiving cancer 
treatments. The Waltham (MA) Hospital embraced this goal, and on April 27th, 
2001, saw the opening ceremony and ribbon cuttting of the magnificent 
Mary Eagan Garden adjoining the Cancer Care Center; providing a setting 
of comfort and solace for people who our hearts go out to. The first Mary Eagan Garden in Canada was opened within the the 4.5 
acre Richard and Annette Bloch Cancer Survivors Park in Ottawa on 
September 24, 2008.
In all, over 40 musical benefit events and multiple recordings have helped to bring Mary's vision to life in <b><a href=""http://www.patiorecords.com/Gardens.cfm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">6 different hospitals and treatment centres</a> </b>so far. <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>You Can Help Ease the Burden<br/>
</h3>We are deeply grateful for your financial help in easing the burden and lifting the spirits of those suffering from cancer and their families, and for helping us to honour Mary Eagan's vision.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Want to help but the wallet is slim? You can do so much by sharing this campaign page in your community, through social media, word-of-mouth, and at your workplace. Thank you in advance for helping us to fulfill our goals!<br/>

<h3>Who?</h3>
<p>I've been writing songs since I was 13 and releasing them since I was 20. Tracks from my last album, 2013's <i>Skipping Away from Dissonance</i>, received moderate airplay on independent and college radio and the record ended up on several year-end best-of lists; an instrumental version of the track ""Time Machine"" from that album was also featured in a trailer for the Broadway production of <i>Peter and the Starcatcher</i>. I've been threatening to release another record since 2014, and I love this particular batch of songs a lot and hope you'll get something out of them too.</p>
<p>Listen to ""I.love.you"" from <i>Skipping Away from Dissonance</i> <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/jonfullermusic/i-love-you"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How?</h3>
<p>With your help! This budget is split 50/50 between recording costs and distribution costs. A further breakdown:</p>
<p>Recording:</p>
<ul>
<li>80%: paying musicians</li>
<li>20%: studio rental/engineer payments</li>
</ul>
<p>Distribution:</p>
<ul>
<li>60%: Marketing and radio</li>
<li>20%: Manufacture and artwork</li>
<li>10%: Mastering</li>
<li>10%: Licensing</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What (do you get in return)?</h3>
<p>Depending on your pledge level, here are some of the perks you'll be rewarded with:</p>
<ul>
<li>A social media shout out (platform of choice)</li>
<li>A digital copy of the album</li>
<li>A signed copy of the album</li>
<li>Handwritten lyrics of a song of your choice</li>
<li>A YouTube cover song of your choice</li>
<li>A handmade, framed artwork of pressed leaves and flowers (see photo below)</li>
<li>I will come to your home and cook you and up to three other people dinner (Tri-State Area only, alas)</li>
<li>And a 90-minute house concert where you have input into the set list **</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As always, with projects like these, there are so many potential variables (studio availability, nuclear war, you know, the usual) that delays may occur. But know that I, John, and everyone else involved with this project are already working hard to make this record a reality, and will not stop until it's completed and in your hands</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>I'm a firm believer in the power of music. I cannot tell you how many songs and artists have shaped who I am today, not only as a musician or a writer but as a person. So many songs have made me really sit and contemplate how I live my life, and have challenged me to become a better version of myself; if I can do that for even one other person, then this record will be a success.</p>
<p>If you can't contribute monetarily, I completely get it -- please spread the word to friends, family, coworkers, anyone who you think might find value in this work. It's much appreciated.</p>

<h3>Singer - Songwriter - Superhero</h3>
<p>I am an eclectic singer and songwriter whose talents have reached the ears of musicians and music lovers from all over the world. I started my music journey senior year of high school in my hometown in Maryland, where I later relocated to Florida for college and began working as a singer and songwriter for one of Orlando's premier recording studios, Plush Studios. I have been so blessed to have worked with amazing artists and producers affiliated with Sony, Universal Music, Capitol Records, Def Jam, The Voice and more. </p>
<p>My writing reflects my personal experiences, hopes, dreams, the good and the bad. My Mantra: Singer - Songwriter - Superhero hints at my goals with music, not only to sing but to write lyrics to help people, that are relate-able, expressive and uplifting. I strive to be my own breed of superhero who uses my gifts and talents with melodies and lyricism to leave my mark in the world, a magical musical legacy. </p>
<p>Most recently I have had my music featured in TV shows such as Orange is the New Black, Switched at birth and Odd Mom Out. I have also had the honor of performing on national television as featured singer in the National Cherry Blossom Festival Parade and the National Independence Day Parade in the heart of Washington, D.C. I was also invited to perform live on WJLA's Good Morning Washington.</p>
<p>I am excited to debut my first solo project titled ""Metaphors"" fusing rock, acoustic melodies, hip-hop and R&amp;B.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Join The Adventure!</h3>
<p>I would love for you to join my music adventure! While I have invested all I have in myself, time, money, all of my money (lol), as any true creative artist does, I need your support to complete this project and take it to the next level. Your contribution will help me the following:</p>

<li>Finalizing recorded songs</li>
<li>Album printing &amp; shipping</li>
<li>Marketing &amp; promotion of the album (digital and print)</li>
<li>Music videos &amp; graphics</li>

<p> </p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal, I plan to fly with whatever amount of fairy dust I have. I will work with what was raised and work hard to release what I can. I will forever be grateful for those who contributed.  </p>

<h2>I Just Wanna Say Thank You!</h2>
</div><div>
<p>I am so grateful to have some amazing friends and colleagues who have invested their time and talents into this project. Completing this project and exceeding my goals won't just be an accomplishment for me but for everyone involved on this journey. I would like to thank those who have been an integral part of this journey thus far:</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The time is now for indie musicians such as myself to take advantage of all the new technologies. With streaming being the new record store, promotion and marketing are very important. Reaching the right audiences can be a challenge, selecting the right audiences to market to can be a risk, but one I am willing to take. I feel my music is relatable to various age groups and backgrounds to both men and women.  I plan to reach out to a PR company who can help hone in on the right audiences, media and outlets and get my music heard!</p>

Your spiritual, emotional, moral, and financial support is gratefully appreciated.Jim Day, jazz guitarist, will be accompanying me.  Jim is excellent and well known in the Seattle music scene.  Jim has played with some very big names (e.g. Henry Mancini) so I feel particularly fortunate to have him back me.This performance - Vignettes: Reflections of Life - is to raise ""love offerings"" for the Divine Goddesses, Seattle Unity women's group, annual retreat scholarship fund, while offering an evening of reflection through the power of music.  There is no ticket price for attendance and all your ""love offerings"" will go to supporting the scholarship fund.  The Richard Hugo House Richard Hugo House Cabaret Café is an intimate room that comfortably seats 40, so space is limited.  There is a beverage bar so you can buy a glass of wine, designer water, teas or coffees to sip during the performance.  The performance will be July 26, 2014, at 7:30pm-9:00pm. More about the Goddesses...The Divine Goddesses have a mission to support women in discovering our strengths, enlightening our minds, owning our bodies, and celebrating our emotions.  Our annual retreat creates sacred space for women to explore spiritual development, service, fun, and community. The Annual Women's Retreat is in its 4th year and the retreat is a profound and joyful experience, and we want to be inclusive of women of all economic means by offering scholarships.What is Needed An estimated $1000 is needed and will be used as follows:
Rent the performance space (Richard Hugo House in Seattle, WA);
Professional musician/Music: create charts, rehearsals, and accompanist 
My time is entirely donated
Any funds raised beyond the basic expenses estimated will go directly into the scholarship fund!  .Other Ways You Can HelpThere are many ways you can support this very good work!  Of course you can contribute funding if Spirit inspires you to and you can share this information with your friends and family - please spread the word.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

I have always written music. From short raps to power ballads, I've found that writing lyrics has been a great way of showing how I feel and getting things off my chest.

I began talking to Josh Kikta of Miss Fortune about writing instrumentals for me so that I could write meaningful lyrics to them that others could relate to. I was going through a lot, including alcohol addiction, what I wanted to go and do with my life, and just who I was in general. I could not find any music that really described what I was going through and I was tired of hearing songs about things that just didn't pertain to me or were so vague that they could have hundreds of meanings. I wanted to be able to touch others that were going through the same things I was. I know what its like to feel like you're controlled by an addiction, that you've lost someone, being homeless and helpless, and that no one is there... I want others to know that I'm here and that they are not alone in their struggles. This EP has five songs, each about a different subject: addiction, apologies, being away from your home and family, motivation, and living your life happy once again. It has taken me over a year to really write how it feels to experience these things and I know that others can hear them and connect as well. So my hope for this campaign is that I can receive enough donations to record the 'Heartfelt' EP and get this music to those who need to know someone is there. I will also be donating a large portion of any leftover money to three different charities: the National Council on Alcoholism &amp; Drug Dependence (NCADD), American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP), and StandUp For Kids (SUFK) which helps homeless youth.</i></font></p><p><font size=""3""><i>                                                                        -Thank you,</i></font></p><p><font size=""3""><i>                                                                                          Phil</i></font><i style=""font-size: medium; line-height: 1.45em;""></i></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FGqPglEHEqKY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DGqPglEHEqKY&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FGqPglEHEqKY%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p><p><font size=""3""><b></b></font></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FSpriQkH6OLk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DSpriQkH6OLk&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FSpriQkH6OLk%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><font size=""3""><b><br/></b></font><p></p><p><font size=""3""><b>What I'm Aiming For:</b></font></p><p><font size=""3"">I will be having the EP recorded, produced and mastered by Josh Kikta and Ian Marchionda, both of Miss Fortune.

Based on our work with him in the past as well as past projects he has released we knew that working with Glen was the way to go. A full e.p. package with Glen includes recording, editing and mixing of the stated number of songs. We would love to reach our goal and record a 5 song e.p. with him but have also considered a 4 song e.p, option. Any money that we raise that will not go to Sheepdog Studios will go to printing the album and supportive merchandise.There will be some fun perks depending on the amount you wish to donate!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Melody and I am a songwriter. If you aren't already familiar with me and my work, please check out: <a href=""http://www.melodywalkermusic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""www.melodywalkermusic.com"">www.melodywalkermusic.com</a> . If you are already a fan, and want to know why I am hitting you up for money, please read on...</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>There's no doubt that the music industry has changed dramatically in the
 past decade. The internet has made it possible for Indie bands and 
artists to reach millions of fans and offer a sound and image that is 
competitive with commercial artists. Modern record execs, publicists and
 booking agents want to see someone who is talented and driven and 
making things happen on their own. They want the whole package, wrapped 
and delivered, with a built-in audience. This takes a little money and 
a ton of hard work. I'm asking you for help with both. <br/></p>
<br/><p>For a little history... I recorded my first live album of originals in the summer of 2005. I hatched a plan for a high-quality, low-budget live recording, and gathered about 40 people to donate $15 to come watch me do it. I had 300 copies of ""<a href=""http://www.orchidcomputers.com/melody/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Live at Shaky Hand"">Live at Shaky Hand</a>"" burned locally and I hand packaged every CD myself. Through college I collaborated with several touring world music bands and released CDs with <a href=""http://www.akabella.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""AkaBella"">AkaBella</a>, <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/womama"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""WoMama"">WoMama</a> and <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/blocofirmeza"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Bloco Firmeza"">Bloco Firmeza</a>. I also ran a women's open-mic night and started the lady-folk trio <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/the-Vintners-Daughters/198729422639"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Vintner's Daughters"">Vintner's Daughters</a> which renewed my love of the Americana music I was raised on. I learned a lot about music production and promotion and had a great time building strong musical communities with those groups, but now It's time for my music to shine again!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In the last five years, and particularly in the last year, I have 
been honing my songwriting voice. The songs are here and now that 
voice is ready to sing! Jacob and I recorded three of these new songs in
 January for a live, acoustic demo (the ""III EP"") that we will use to get gigs and shop
 to record companies, but I'm not holding my breath waiting for a record
 deal to make the album of my dreams: I'm going to do it grassroots 
style... and I need your help! </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In the next nine months I will record, mix, master, manufacture, promote and release my first solo studio album. This album will consist of at least eleven new full-band, professional, multi-track arrangements with great fidelity and production value. It also comes with a commitment on my part to promote the album as a full-time job and tour tirelessly to support it. I have spent the last ten years acquiring the skills I need to undertake this project independently, and now I am ready to rock. <i>It's now or never</i>. All I need is a little push from the people I love.</p>

<h3>Pandulce 3-month Artist Residency 2015, Denver</h3>
<p>Hello! I am Gabriel Todd aka Pandulce, vocalist/songwriter/producer/dancer/performer living in Oakland, California. <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/pandulce/good-morning-traveller"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pandulce music</a> is a genre-fluid blend of roots music, folk, experimental pop, field recordings, and electronic music. It incorporates solo and polyphonic vocals, acoustic instruments (banjo, uke, guitar, melodica, etc.) and a laptop. I produce and perform music as a solo act, in bands, in contemporary dance classes, as well as in live dance and theater performance. Over the past 5 years I have had the opportunity to tour and travel in Europe, Costa Rica, and throughout the United States as a performer, musician, and dancer. After some years of collaborating and touring in works instigated/directed by others I feel inspired and ready to take my own show on the road. I have been in the Bay Area for
 a few years working, 
occasionally thriving, and sometimes struggling, but mostly jobbing just to pay rent. Its time to take some space and time from the hustle 
and hone in on what really matters to me----sharing in live music and 
movement with you!<br/></p>
<p>I am excited to announce that I will be headed to Denver in January for a 3-month independently-produced artist residency. During the residency I will work full-time to develop a live music act/show to perform on the road in all kinds of venues as well as a modest 4-song EP.  I have secured the support of some of my favorite local Colorado musicians, dancers, and videographers as well as an awesome temporary home and work space in Denver. Now I need your support to bring this vision into full flight in 2015.</p>
<p><i>FLY: a late night livingroom performance.....</i><br/></p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FBr7oCu77Qa8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DBr7oCu77Qa8&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FBr7oCu77Qa8%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/>
<p></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Exchange<br/>
</h3> <p>Let's have an exchange! As an independent musician and performer I rely on the support of fans, friends, and family to share what I do with more people. I have 30 days to raise $6000 to launch the Denver
 residency and production of the downloadable 4-song EP. I would love the opportunity to share this project with you in a live or recorded context in 2015 and beyond. This residency is the next step in making that possible. Before I tell you about the perks of donating, here is the budget.<br/></p>
<p><b>Residency Budget: $6000.</b><br/></p>
<p>$1400.    work studio/room rental and basic utilities for 3 months<br/></p>
<p>$1200.    Food for 3 months</p>
<p>$3000.   Recording, producing, mastering downloadable 4-song  EP. <br/></p>$400.      Air fare SFO&gt;DEN&gt;SFO<br/><br/><p>Your donations however big or small will enable me to develop and share this music with more people. In exchange for your donation I am offering some awesome perks. If you donate at least $10. you will receive a download of the 4-song EP, to be released by the end of April. Donate $25 and you can download the EP plus receive a set of 4 unique postcards featuring prints of my collage art work. Folks who give $100. or more will have access to a weekly video blog featuring updates, mini concerts and short interviews with collaborators. I am also offering a limited edition of handmade (by me) Pandulce bird dolls for those who donate $500. There are other perks on offer, please have a look to the right. &gt;<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>I am confident that funds can be raised to make this happen. Any and all funds raised here will support the residency and recording project no matter what. If I raise less than my goal I will eat beans and rice and record the EP in my work studio with less professional engineering support. If I make more than my goal, I will put that money toward the best recorded sound possible as well as pay collaborators, musicians, and videographers modest artist fees.</p>

</div> <div> <h3>The Process<br/>

<p><b>What's an independently-produced artist residency?</b> Independently-produced is simply referring to 
the fact that I have no institutional sponsorship or support for this 
residency. That's why I am reaching out to you. One of the benefits of independently-producing is that artists have more control over what we make
 and how and where we distribute and perform. With your contribution and support
 I can spend the time it takes to develop and produce something that 
I will be excited to take on the road and share with a wider audience.<br/></p>
<p><b>Why 
Denver?</b> I spent 7 years in Denver and Boulder training, making and performing with 
some amazing musicians, artists, dancers and friends. I am looking 
forward to some collaborations, inspirations, and re-connections with 
the landscape and the people. I know the quiet and the spaciousness of 
the mountains and plains has much to offer me, especially in the winter.
 I look forward to returning to the Bay Area refreshed and renewed and 
ready to share some new music and performance with all of you. If you 
don't live in Denver, Boulder or the Bay Area then I look forward to seeing you on a future
 tour!</p>
<p><b>What experiences have led you to this?</b> I have been making art and performing most of my life. Some specific moments stand out as testament to my ability to take my music performance and new album to the next level.<br/></p>
<p>In 2002, I was a featured vocalist and musical collaborator in a 
contemporary circus called <a href=""http://youtu.be/0kHgPfAQk4w"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Circo Zero</a>. A little less than a year after a
 successful one month run in the SF Bay Area we produced a <a href=""http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/circozero"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CD version</a> of
 music from the show. We also performed for 3 consecutive summers at the
 Oregon Country Fair in Eugene, Oregon. I grew a lot as a performer and 
music maker in the process of writing, rehearsing, performing and then 
finally recording in collaboration with Loren Olds, Neal Stewart, and 
Keith Hennessey. </p>
<p>In the 7 years I was in Boulder/Denver I completed 2 degree programs, a BFA in Performance at Naropa University and an MFA in Dance Performance and Choreography at CU Boulder. My focus in both degree programs was the intersection of live music, dance, and <a href=""http://vimeo.com/25599056"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">video</a>/film.  During that time I also continued to make and perform original music both inside and outside of the university context in bars, theaters, and local festivals. </p>

<p><b>What challenges might you face?</b> When it comes to preparing to share my work with a live audience I am sometimes a perfectionist. This isn't always a bad thing, but it can slow me down at times. During the residency I will have a set schedule of working on new material, rehearsing for performing, recording and interaction/collaboration with other artists. I plan to keep myself moving, making and performing so that my perfecting is part of a generative context of doing/sharing live music. <br/></p>
<p>My past experiences in living, making and performing have laid the foundation for this next phase of my artistic development.

Hello! I am Gabriel Todd aka Pandulce, vocalist/songwriter/producer/dancer/performer living in Oakland, California. Pandulce music is a genre-fluid blend of roots music, folk, experimental pop, field recordings, and electronic music. It incorporates solo and polyphonic vocals, acoustic instruments (banjo, uke, guitar, melodica, etc.) and a laptop. I produce and perform music as a solo act, in bands, in contemporary dance classes, as well as in live dance and theater performance. Over the past 5 years I have had the opportunity to tour and travel in Europe, Costa Rica, and throughout the United States as a performer, musician, and dancer. After some years of collaborating and touring in works instigated/directed by others I feel inspired and ready to take my own show on the road. I have been in the Bay Area for
 a few years working, 
occasionally thriving, and sometimes struggling, but mostly jobbing just to pay rent. Its time to take some space and time from the hustle 
and hone in on what really matters to me----sharing in live music and 
movement with you!
I am excited to announce that I will be headed to Denver in January for a 3-month independently-produced artist residency. During the residency I will work full-time to develop a live music act/show to perform on the road in all kinds of venues as well as a modest 4-song EP.  I have secured the support of some of my favorite local Colorado musicians, dancers, and videographers as well as an awesome temporary home and work space in Denver. Now I need your support to bring this vision into full flight in 2015.
FLY: a late night livingroom performance.....


  The Exchange
 Let's have an exchange! As an independent musician and performer I rely on the support of fans, friends, and family to share what I do with more people. I have 30 days to raise $6000 to launch the Denver
 residency and production of the downloadable 4-song EP. I would love the opportunity to share this project with you in a live or recorded context in 2015 and beyond. This residency is the next step in making that possible. Before I tell you about the perks of donating, here is the budget.
Residency Budget: $6000.
$1400.    work studio/room rental and basic utilities for 3 months
$1200.    Food for 3 months
$3000.   Recording, producing, mastering downloadable 4-song  EP. $400.      Air fare SFO>DEN>SFOYour donations however big or small will enable me to develop and share this music with more people. In exchange for your donation I am offering some awesome perks. If you donate at least $10. you will receive a download of the 4-song EP, to be released by the end of April. Donate $25 and you can download the EP plus receive a set of 4 unique postcards featuring prints of my collage art work. Folks who give $100. or more will have access to a weekly video blog featuring updates, mini concerts and short interviews with collaborators. I am also offering a limited edition of handmade (by me) Pandulce bird dolls for those who donate $500. There are other perks on offer, please have a look to the right. >

I am confident that funds can be raised to make this happen. Any and all funds raised here will support the residency and recording project no matter what. If I raise less than my goal I will eat beans and rice and record the EP in my work studio with less professional engineering support. If I make more than my goal, I will put that money toward the best recorded sound possible as well as pay collaborators, musicians, and videographers modest artist fees.



  The Process

What's an independently-produced artist residency? Independently-produced is simply referring to 
the fact that I have no institutional sponsorship or support for this 
residency. That's why I am reaching out to you. One of the benefits of independently-producing is that artists have more control over what we make
 and how and where we distribute and perform. With your contribution and support
 I can spend the time it takes to develop and produce something that 
I will be excited to take on the road and share with a wider audience.
Why 
Denver? I spent 7 years in Denver and Boulder training, making and performing with 
some amazing musicians, artists, dancers and friends. I am looking 
forward to some collaborations, inspirations, and re-connections with 
the landscape and the people. I know the quiet and the spaciousness of 
the mountains and plains has much to offer me, especially in the winter.
 I look forward to returning to the Bay Area refreshed and renewed and 
ready to share some new music and performance with all of you. If you 
don't live in Denver, Boulder or the Bay Area then I look forward to seeing you on a future
 tour!
What experiences have led you to this? I have been making art and performing most of my life. Some specific moments stand out as testament to my ability to take my music performance and new album to the next level.
In 2002, I was a featured vocalist and musical collaborator in a 
contemporary circus called Circo Zero. A little less than a year after a
 successful one month run in the SF Bay Area we produced a CD version of
 music from the show. We also performed for 3 consecutive summers at the
 Oregon Country Fair in Eugene, Oregon. I grew a lot as a performer and 
music maker in the process of writing, rehearsing, performing and then

In the 7 years I was in Boulder/Denver I completed 2 degree programs, a BFA in Performance at Naropa University and an MFA in Dance Performance and Choreography at CU Boulder. My focus in both degree programs was the intersection of live music, dance, and video/film.  During that time I also continued to make and perform original music both inside and outside of the university context in bars, theaters, and local festivals. 
For the past few years I have maintained a presence on Soundcloud, producing sound/music content for a growing international audience. I have been sharing new music, experimental tracks, as well as sound scores created for live performance. Here are some links to recent tracks produced for soundcloud listeners:

<p>(Words from video)<br/></p>
<p>Hi, I'm George Dziov, also known as Android-Music over the web! So why am I sitting here in front of HQ cam and talking to ya? I'm pretty sure there's a lot of indie gamers who love metal as much as I do and would like to listen to their favorite music in heavy mind breaking arrangement! So I'm here to bring some metal to the Indie Scene! Let's go to my cabin!<br/>Currently I'm working on an album devoted to the 5 best and most promising indie games of this decade, those are Aquaria, Braid, Overgrowth, Super Meat Boy and Machinarium. Why did I make such a crazy decision? It all begins from the Wolfire website...<br/>Once I heard some cool rock tracks on Wolfire web blog I decided to make my own contribution, I showed the track to the Wolfire guys, they liked the track and suggested me to make a guest post, that was really awesome! Later they organized Humble Indie Bundle which gave me great inspiration! That's how that idea with an ""indie"" album came to me.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There was a lot of Mario, Sonic, Contra, Castlevania remixes, why not make metal remixes on these 5 really rocking games? My opinion? That will sound epic, some tracks are already done!!! Of course these games have already great soundtracks, I'd prefer to  call 'em masterpieces but I DO NOT imagine Indie World without some hot metallic teeth scratching remixes! It's a really nice surprise for indies, nah?<br/></p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Raul has been a member of the British Columbia Boy's Choir since 2004. He has had the good fortune over the years to participate in tours to China, France, Italy, Holland, Australia as well as various places in North America. This year the choir is scheduled to tour Costa Rica in March 2012, but due to financial constraints Raul and his family are unable to come up with the funds. As an important part of the Baritone section, he would be greatly missed, and as well, being that he is in grade 11 and will be graduating highschool the following year, this tour to Costa Rica would likely be his last tour with the choir. The choir has been such a huge part of Raul's life and has been such a positive force in his life, musically and otherwise. He deperately wants to sing with the choir on this his last international tour.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If Raul cannot raise the money, he will not be able to tour with the choir to Costa Rica. He is searching for a part time job to help fund it and his parents are also doing their best to contribute but these are difficult times. He would be sorely missed by the choir if he was unable to come up with the funds.</p>

</div></div>","Our Story
Raul has been a member of the British Columbia Boy's Choir since 2004. He has had the good fortune over the years to participate in tours to China, France, Italy, Holland, Australia as well as various places in North America. This year the choir is scheduled to tour Costa Rica in March 2012, but due to financial constraints Raul and his family are unable to come up with the funds. As an important part of the Baritone section, he would be greatly missed, and as well, being that he is in grade 11 and will be graduating highschool the following year, this tour to Costa Rica would likely be his last tour with the choir. The choir has been such a huge part of Raul's life and has been such a positive force in his life, musically and otherwise. He deperately wants to sing with the choir on this his last international tour.

The Impact
If Raul cannot raise the money, he will not be able to tour with the choir to Costa Rica. He is searching for a part time job to help fund it and his parents are also doing their best to contribute but these are difficult times. He would be sorely missed by the choir if he was unable to come up with the funds.


What We Need & What You Get
The total cost for Raul to tour (everything included) and perform in Costa Rica in March of 2012 is $2900.00.
If you would like to be eligible for a tax reciept you may send a cheque made out to the BC Boys Choir with ""Tour for Raul"" written on the memo line. Receipts will be issued for donations over $20 and can be sent to BC Boys Choir c/o P.O. Box 321, Stn A Nanaimo BC V9R 5L3 Canada

UPDATE JAN 2ND 2011
Thank you to all of you who have contributed! With the money that was sent directly to the British Columbia Boy's Choir I have reached my goal... Costa Rica here I come!!!!!!!!

<h3>Who is Katie?!</h3>
<p>Hi! So my name is Katie Clarke and I am a tea drinking, cat loving English pianist living in Los Angeles. I started playing the piano at a very young age, and trained as a classical concert pianist.</p>
<h3><strong>So who is Estela?!</strong></h3>
<p>Well now you have met Katie, time to meet <strong><i>Estela</i></strong>. Estela is a new character I have created that is hoping to blur the lines between the<i> past</i>, <i>present</i> and <i>future.</i> Her music takes inspiration from the classical piano music from centuries ago, and fuses it alongside the pop culture and musical trends of today. She's fierce, she's fun and she's out to revolutionise the piano music world! </p>
<h3>To make the dream a reality</h3>
<p>Now in a perfect world, I would click my fingers and Estela would be ready to go, fabulous outfit and all! But unfortunately to make this wish come true I need your help. </p>
<p>My goal is to raise $5000 so I can transport Estela from the page to the stage (oh yes, I'm so excited I'm rhyming!) Your donations will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>An in ear monitor system - so I can hear what I'm doing while performing</li>
<li>A music video - that includes a videographer, photographer, makeup artist and venue</li>
<li>Sound engineering - professional mixing and mastering</li>
<li>An album - ready for digital download or hard copy sales</li>
<li>A fabulously fierce outfit - for the final touch in live performance  </li>
<li>Cat toys - Ok....this one is fake.....although cat toy donations will always be accepted </li>
</ul>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>Aside from my enternal gratitude, perks will include a free signed copy of the album, a signed copy of my lead single score, and a personalised dedication in the liner notes. </p>
<h3>On a personal note... (pun intended)</h3>
<p>This is definitely a project that means a lot to me. Not only is it a chance for me to share a vision that I have been working on for years, but I really want to highlight how not all musicians have to stay in their pocket, and instead can branch out and experiment. For many years, classical music, in particular, conjures up images of being ""boring"", ""old"" or ""dry"". Although Estela isn't keeping it in it's original form, she still heavily uses and references many of the <i>amazing</i> pieces of music written hundreds of years ago, and hopefully showcases them off in a new light that will bring in an audience who may have passed the original by!</p>
<h3>Please Share!</h3>
<p>So finally.....thank you so so much, and if you aren't able to contribute, please share it with your family and friends and help me make this happen! </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Since our 2013 inception, Northern Shakedown has been producing tremors throughout the Pacific Northwest. ""One of the local rock scene’s hardest-working and most standout groups"" (Northwest Music Scene, 2016).</p>
<p>We are two sets of brothers who all play a very important role in the music writing process, which is different from traditional bands where one or two members write most, if not all of the music. This unique format has allowed us to create captivating music for a wide range of fans, as our musical soul is not confined to a particular genre. The bond we share has brought us through good times and bad as we've performed around the PNW and West Coast over the past four years. During 2016, Northern Shakedown was hard at work producing the upcoming Vibrations EP with notable producer, Bubba Jones. We have invested over $5,000 of our own money into the project, but are in need of your support to bring the fruits of our hard work to the rest of the West. If we are able to reach our goal by the end of 40 days, then we will be able to properly release this EP with a successful marketing campaign and tour to bring the love back to our hometown of Seattle. We have invested everything we have into this project, but now turn to you, our faithful fans, to help propel us to the next level.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> In order to make the Vibrations EP release a successful one, we are hoping to raise a total of $8,000 in contributions over a span of 40 days. The contributions from this campaign will aid us in packaging and distribution, production of the project merch, and tour expenses when we venture down the coast in August, 2017. We have run the numbers and expect to spend $1500 in packaging/distribution of the EP, $1500+ in marketing, $1000+ in merch production, $1000+ for a music video, and the rest will go toward a month-long tour in support of the release. Now, we aren't just looking for handouts. Each of your contributions, regardless of the price donated, will be accepted with a reciprocal gift from the band. We have 10 different perks levels, all with their own unique reward, and your donation will fall into one of these categories of perks. The perks will range from a postcard while on tour to Sasquatch Hunting (camping trip) with yours truly.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal of $8,000 after 40 days, then we will be obligated to shift our strategy to putting whatever money we do raise into CD packaging and merchandise production. After hitting the road for a short while, back in mid September, we learned that you cant expect to make much your first couple of times on the road. Without the funding we have included in our budgeting, an alternate way of making money on the road is crucial in order to come close to breaking even.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With music being a major part of our history's generational revolution, Northern Shakedown is next in line to tear down the wall and push the boundaries with a unique and refreshing vibe. We are bringing original music and are ready for the rest of the West to join us on this journey. By supporting us and contributing, you will forever be a part of the musical revolution that is Northern Shakedown. Four brothers who have invested everything into making this project work, not only have the longevity to succeed, but the mindset, and determination to ensure it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have taken into account the risks and challenges that we may face on the way, and have prepared for them the best that we can:</p>
<p> The first and biggest risk is the fact that we don't have much of a presence in other parts of the west coast. We have been proactive in tackling this obstacle by gathering data on press in each city we will visit, and have been also reaching out to other bands with bigger presences in these cities to ensure a good turn out at each show. Other than our social media presence, press outlets are going to be our best source of promotion in new cities. </p>
<p>The second risk would be the risk of our van breaking down. We have a band van that has treated us well in the past, but we also don't have the utmost faith in this vehicle. We are planning for the worst by getting a tune up before the trip, and have all necessary road side assistance tools and services. A touring vehicle is a concern for any touring musician, so we have prepared ourselves for the worst.</p>
<p>In addition to the plan to overcome these hurdles, us being a band of brothers plays a huge role in how we will overcome them as a team. We have been through a lot of trials together, not just musically, and we always manage to lift each other up with support and get through whatever has tested us.</p>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><p>And that's all there is to it...</p><p>We understand that you may not be able to contribute financially, as we have all been there, but there is something you can do..... Share our campaign and like our Facebook page. Tell your friends about the Northern Shakedown Movement and be the reason they started listening to us. Thank you so much for all of your support and love. We look forward to sending those perks!</p></div>","Short Summary

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i><a href=""http://www.sonemus.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.sonemus.com</a></i></p>
<p><strong>The Society Of NEw MUsic Sarajevo - SONEMUS</strong> (Lat. - <i>""let us sound""</i>) was established in 2001 in order to perform, promote and educate in the domain of contemporary artistic music. Being the only ensemble for contemporary music in Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, SONEMUS attracts a huge audience, music students as well as the general public at their concerts and lectures.</p>
<p>The ensemble members are musicians based in Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina,  Switzerland, Germany, France, Slovenia and the United Kingdom who share the same passion: contemporary classical music!</p>
<p>Our wish is to present the biggest musical achievements of the 20th and 21st century to the Bosnian-Herzegovinian audience, where contemporary music still has a status of an almost exotic and unkown genre of classical music.<strong> We offer all of our concerts with no admission. </strong></p>
<p>In the past projects, we performed a various number of contemporary music ""classics"" (A. Schönberg: <i>""Pierrot Lunaire""</i>, F. Romitelli <i>""Professor Bad Trip""</i>, G. Grisey <i>""Vortex Temporum""</i> amongst many others - all of them PREMIERE performances in Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina) as well as new works and premieres by young local and international composers. Our work in the field of contemporary music is always very appreciated in the local and regional scene, which can be seen by the sheer number of audience we get at every concert of the festival.</p>
<p>This year, we are giving first performances of György Ligeti's crucial <i>Chamber Concerto</i>, <i>""Music box""</i> by Serbian/German Composer Marko Nikodijević and compositions by Bosnian composers Ališer Sijarić and Hanan Hadžajlić. We will join forces with two other ensembles: <strong>Ensemble Neofonia</strong> from Slovenia and the <strong>Pre-Art Soloists</strong> from Switzerland. </p>
<p>Our festival will be held from <strong>April 7th - 9th 2017 in Sarajevo, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina</strong>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486057498/e5oejwikkprnzfrkcguq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our musicians will hold workshops for music students and/or curious people who want to learn more about contemporary playing techniques on various instruments (piano, violin, cello, clarinet, flute, percussion).</p>
<p>Guest composers <strong>Vinko Globokar</strong> (FR/SLO), <strong>Marko Nikodijević</strong> (SR/DE), <strong>Uroš Rojko</strong> (SLO) and <strong>Urška Pompe</strong> (SLO) will hold lectures for composition students and anyone interested.</p>
<p>We believe that together we can be part of the cultural life in Sarajevo, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina and the region and make contemporary music more known and accessible in regions that do not have a huge variety of concerts and workshops with international musicians. <strong>By contributing to the SONEMUS Fest, you are supporting local music students, musicians and composers from Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, as well as their need to collaborate with international musicians. </strong></p>
<p>Since contemporary classical music is neither recognised nor well established in Bosnia and Herzegovina, we believe that the cultural scene would benefit greatly from this event.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486057932/mcds8ga0r1tyzspjhmxi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>For the realisation of our project, we still need 5000 USD: </p>
<p>-1000 USD for renting performance material (sheet music)</p>
<p>-2000 USD for flight tickets and lodging for our international members and guest musicians</p>
<p>-1000 USD to cover the travel/lodging costs of our invited composers </p>
<p>-1000 USD to cover the concert hall costs in Sarajevo</p>
<p>If we don't reach our full goal, we will distribute the money proportionally towards the same needs as we did before. However, we might have to cancel some of the concerts if we can not afford to put them on, and that will be a real shame!</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
www.sonemus.com
The Society Of NEw MUsic Sarajevo - SONEMUS (Lat. - ""let us sound"") was established in 2001 in order to perform, promote and educate in the domain of contemporary artistic music. Being the only ensemble for contemporary music in Bosnia & Herzegovina, SONEMUS attracts a huge audience, music students as well as the general public at their concerts and lectures.
The ensemble members are musicians based in Bosnia & Herzegovina,  Switzerland, Germany, France, Slovenia and the United Kingdom who share the same passion: contemporary classical music!
Our wish is to present the biggest musical achievements of the 20th and 21st century to the Bosnian-Herzegovinian audience, where contemporary music still has a status of an almost exotic and unkown genre of classical music. We offer all of our concerts with no admission. 
In the past projects, we performed a various number of contemporary music ""classics"" (A. Schönberg: ""Pierrot Lunaire"", F. Romitelli ""Professor Bad Trip"", G. Grisey ""Vortex Temporum"" amongst many others - all of them PREMIERE performances in Bosnia & Herzegovina) as well as new works and premieres by young local and international composers. Our work in the field of contemporary music is always very appreciated in the local and regional scene, which can be seen by the sheer number of audience we get at every concert of the festival.
This year, we are giving first performances of György Ligeti's crucial Chamber Concerto, ""Music box"" by Serbian/German Composer Marko Nikodijević and compositions by Bosnian composers Ališer Sijarić and Hanan Hadžajlić. We will join forces with two other ensembles: Ensemble Neofonia from Slovenia and the Pre-Art Soloists from Switzerland. 
Our festival will be held from April 7th - 9th 2017 in Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herzegovina.

Our musicians will hold workshops for music students and/or curious people who want to learn more about contemporary playing techniques on various instruments (piano, violin, cello, clarinet, flute, percussion).
Guest composers Vinko Globokar (FR/SLO), Marko Nikodijević (SR/DE), Uroš Rojko (SLO) and Urška Pompe (SLO) will hold lectures for composition students and anyone interested.
We believe that together we can be part of the cultural life in Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herzegovina and the region and make contemporary music more known and accessible in regions that do not have a huge variety of concerts and workshops with international musicians. By contributing to the SONEMUS Fest, you are supporting local music students, musicians and composers from Bosnia & Herzegovina, as well as their need to collaborate with international musicians. 
Since contemporary classical music is neither recognised nor well established in Bosnia and Herzegovina, we believe that the cultural scene would benefit greatly from this event.


What We Need & What You Get
For the realisation of our project, we still need 5000 USD: 
-1000 USD for renting performance material (sheet music)
-2000 USD for flight tickets and lodging for our international members and guest musicians
-1000 USD to cover the travel/lodging costs of our invited composers 
-1000 USD to cover the concert hall costs in Sarajevo
If we don't reach our full goal, we will distribute the money proportionally towards the same needs as we did before. However, we might have to cancel some of the concerts if we can not afford to put them on, and that will be a real shame!
Please don't let us cancel any of our concerts and support us as much as you can!
ANY contribution from you makes a difference for us and gets us one step closer to the realisation of our project!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are Confluence, a mother-daughter duo from Western New York State. Nadine contributes the flute and foot percussion, Barbara contributes the piano, and we both contribute our joy of playing traditional music from Québec, New England, Ireland, Scotland, and more, for contra dances and concerts.</p>
<p>In addition, this album will include touches of Latin, blues, and English country dance music, lots of original tunes, and some crooked tunes we couldn't get away with at a dance.</p>
<h3>About Us</h3>
<p><strong>Nadine Dyskant-Miller </strong>grew up going to contra dances and soon after beginning flute, she became addicted to tunes at a local jam session. In addition to recording this album, some things she may be found doing (not necessarily at the same time) include: working on small organic farms, performing traditional tunes and songs with the band Ensoleil, writing and performing music/theater/words as part of the Suburban Piano Quartet, contra dancing, and cross-country skiing with her dad.</p>
<p><strong>Barbara Dyskant </strong>has enjoyed piano all her life. Since beginning classical training at age 9, she branched out into blues, jazz, Latin, swing, and groove, including leading a nine-piece band. She was introduced to traditional music when Nadine persuaded her to go to a session 13 years ago, and she has been in love with it ever since. She also loves gardening, hiking, dancing, photography, swimming, meeting people, and learning about the world. If she can bring happiness to people through her music, she's happy.</p>
<p><strong>Six months ago</strong> we decided to record this album, and since then we have been arranging new sets, writing tunes, and playing playing playing. Now we are ready to bring this music from our living room, through the studio, to your living room. We are recording the tracks in early March and plan to finish mixing, mastering, and post-production in May or June. But for that to happen, we need your help!</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
We are Confluence, a mother-daughter duo from Western New York State. Nadine contributes the flute and foot percussion, Barbara contributes the piano, and we both contribute our joy of playing traditional music from Québec, New England, Ireland, Scotland, and more, for contra dances and concerts.
In addition, this album will include touches of Latin, blues, and English country dance music, lots of original tunes, and some crooked tunes we couldn't get away with at a dance.

 from June 29-July 6 for a week-long long mission with Freestyle 
Missions out of Atlanta. The primary focus will be concert outreaches in
 four Jamaican communities. B.A.N.G. (Building A New Generation) was 
founded in the summer of 2009, and has become a widely accepted and 
anticipated event since that time.  As you may recall, I had the 
privilege of going on the initial trip in 2009.  Several other rap 
artists, a missions team, and I will take a four day tour to the 
parishes/cities of Spalding, Melrose, Contrivance, and Kingston. Along 
with the concerts, the missions team will be offering workshops and a 
basketball clinic.  Additionally, we plan to serve Spalding's Gospel 
Assembly Church by assisting with light construction work on their new 
facility. <br/>I'd really appreciate your support in sharing Christ in <span><span class=""il"">Jamaica</span></span> through music and practical service.  We're all raising our funds and taking ownership of the tour.  <br/>We've already made our deposit, and I'm excited to say Jessica and I are going together!  I'm confident it

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>What started off as just songwriting sessions with Iran and I slowly turned into a therapy session instead. We started writing really deep personal songs that we felt we couldn't just give to another artist. So we formed ""Willow Crest"" and wrote during the pandemic non-stop, expressing so much of what we felt during these uncertain times. One of the songs was ""Follow You"" , which is why we are here asking for your help in making the music video possible. We want to give you something as beautiful and cinematic like the song itself. We hope you can follow us on our musical journey by donating to our campaign. All proceeds will be going directly to getting this music video done exactly as we envision it to be, which definitely won't come without its perks. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We value you and your support because without you there would be no Willow Crest. We have been so grateful for all the ongoing support we've gotten from our livestreams with <a href=""https://www.highplateauproductions.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">High Plateau Productions</a>, performing at <a href=""https://themintla.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LA's legendary The Mint</a>, and our very first single release <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckgCS96t8xM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Look at Me"".</a></p>
<p>The music video for ""Look at Me"" was Directed and Shot by Exxy but was done DIY style on a shoestring budget and we got really lucky with the location that was donated to us. But this time we must pay more factoring in for location, lights, prop rentals, costumes and crew. As this one will be more of a cinematic/story based music video. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As we said before we formed during the Pandemic and that hasn't come without its hardships. On top of being independent artist who produce, edit, mix, record and do most of the work ourselves. We also had a car robbery back on Feb 25th and still are fighting with the insurance company to get money back to replace what was stolen. Some of the items were my camera which we shot ""Look at Me"" with, my computer, along with camera equipment, my wallet, an iPad, some clothes and Iran's Taylor Guitar.  This set us back from releasing the single sooner and getting the music video done as well. That's why we decided to do this to help us get this done with the community of people whom have been our biggest cheerleaders during these uncertain times. You have kept us going and made us feel like we must be on the right track. From those of you that bought tickets to our livestreams and to those of you who bought our demos of the month through <a href=""https://willowcrest.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our Bandcamp</a>. We hope to give you the best possible quality music video with the team we have in place. </p>
<p>We appreciate you all so much because it has driven us to move forward no matter the obstacle. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you don't have the money to donate we completely understand as these are crazy times. But you can still help us by SHARING this video with friends on any of your social media accounts. It would be greatly appreciated! Again we don't do this for money, we do it because we love it and hope YOU, the listener can relate to the songs we write. </p>

The music video for ""Look at Me"" was Directed and Shot by Exxy but was done DIY style on a shoestring budget and we got really lucky with the location that was donated to us. But this time we must pay more factoring in for location, lights, prop rentals, costumes and crew. As this one will be more of a cinematic/story based music video. 

Risks & Challenges
As we said before we formed during the Pandemic and that hasn't come without its hardships. On top of being independent artist who produce, edit, mix, record and do most of the work ourselves. We also had a car robbery back on Feb 25th and still are fighting with the insurance company to get money back to replace what was stolen. Some of the items were my camera which we shot ""Look at Me"" with, my computer, along with camera equipment, my wallet, an iPad, some clothes and Iran's Taylor Guitar.  This set us back from releasing the single sooner and getting the music video done as well. That's why we decided to do this to help us get this done with the community of people whom have been our biggest cheerleaders during these uncertain times. You have kept us going and made us feel like we must be on the right track. From those of you that bought tickets to our livestreams and to those of you who bought our demos of the month through our Bandcamp. We hope to give you the best possible quality music video with the team we have in place. 
We appreciate you all so much because it has driven us to move forward no matter the obstacle. 
 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you don't have the money to donate we completely understand as these are crazy times. But you can still help us by SHARING this video with friends on any of your social media accounts. It would be greatly appreciated! Again we don't do this for money, we do it because we love it and hope YOU, the listener can relate to the songs we write. 
 
We love you!

<p>I've always been inspired by my Italian immigrant heritage and have been privileged to find ever-more inspiration as a street performer on my busking tours of Italy. The core of Dell'Italia is music of the Italian Renaissance and Middle Ages along with several pieces of Italian folk music, some of which I grew up with. To top it off I included original pieces that I've written on my travels through Italy.</p>
<p>I've been playing music all my life, inspired by my father singing me to sleep every night as a child. I've been performing professionally since 1998 and making my full-time living as a musician since 2002. My bread and butter is the renaissance festival circuit, but due to Covid-19 all my 2020 contracts have been cancelled after only three weekends. </p>
<p>In January, before everything went to pieces, I recorded this album and I consider it the best work I've ever done. Normally I'd just charge printing costs to a credit card and take a bet on my faire season, but that's not an option with this project. Still, I'd love to put it into the world!</p>
<p>This is where you come in. By preordering the album you'll allow me to release it, not only for mail distribution but in preparation for the world to eventually reopen. With a new album in my hands I'll be positioned to leap back into my festival schedule after a long hiatus, hopefully making up some of the financial ground I've lost due to lockdown.</p>
</div><div>
<p>I have a goal of $1200, which will finance a full print run of the album. I'm working with a CD printing company I've used many times in the past and I have every confidence in their capabilities and their quote. If I don't meet my goal I can still do a much more limited print run to guarantee fulfillment of every order, even though it wouldn't do nearly as much to help my position in the long term.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your support!</p>

<h2>What is this Singing and Swinging thing?</h2>
<p>Hi there.  I'm Leslie Spring and I've been a recording and performing singer and multi-intrumentalist for ... well let's just say a while now.</p>
<p>I have a passion for classic jazz and the Great American Songbook.  So that passion led me to write and record a collection of brand new songs with everything from soulful jazz ballads to bebop and juke-joint jumping songs, with some good old NY/Vegas style swing for good measure.</p>
<p>I have done a lot of music over the course of my career, but this collection of almost all original songs is something special to me, and I am looking forward to the opportunity to share this album with you.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>So what's the money for?<br/></strong></h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>The album is recorded, so what's next?</p>
<p>First of all, there's mixing and mastering the album.  I feel good about having captured some great performances with terrific sound quality, but it still needs a little more work to make it ""CD-ready"" for your listening pleasure.</p>
<p>Next up is manufacturing.  Depending on how many pledges/orders I receive, I will have CDs in sleeves and digipaks manufactured to match those orders.  Of course, the more orders I receive, the lower per-unit manufacturing cost, and the more money I can put toward other parts of the project.</p>
And I've built in just a little overhead for shipping, included in your perk if it is physical media, or overhead for the 3rd-party digital download service if you go that route.
<p>Oops!  Let's not forget that before I can distribute those physical CDs, I have to pre-pay royalty/license fees for those 3 bonus songs.</p>
Finally, I will also use some of these pledged funds in support of marketing/promoting the CD, and for getting a wider distribution network going.  This indiegogo project is really intended to jump-start something (hopefully) bigger than this round of pledges and perk shipments.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<h2>What if I don't reach the $5000 funding goal?</h2>
<div>My goal of $5000 is calculated to fund a larger cost effective CD manufacturing run and a small promotional campaign.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>However, rest assured that no matter what level of funsing I reach with this indiegogo project, I will do a manufacturing run of CDs to fulfill everyone's selected perks.</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h2>Why ""Sings and Swings"" is special...</h2>
<p>This new album expresses my love of classic swinging jazz vocal songs, but is intended to contribute some new material to the genre in a compelling way.  If you love old Sinatra, Bennett, Ella, Nat ""King"" Cole and more, I think you'll love the songs I've written and recorded for you.</p>
<p>I am coming to you, my supporters, with the album already recorded.  So the creative ""hard part"" is over.</p>
I just need your help to put these songs in a package that you'll love, and to kick off what I hope will be a success in this exciting phase of my musical career.</div></div>","What is this Singing and Swinging thing?

The album is recorded, so what's next?
First of all, there's mixing and mastering the album.  I feel good about having captured some great performances with terrific sound quality, but it still needs a little more work to make it ""CD-ready"" for your listening pleasure.
Next up is manufacturing.  Depending on how many pledges/orders I receive, I will have CDs in sleeves and digipaks manufactured to match those orders.  Of course, the more orders I receive, the lower per-unit manufacturing cost, and the more money I can put toward other parts of the project.
And I've built in just a little overhead for shipping, included in your perk if it is physical media, or overhead for the 3rd-party digital download service if you go that route.
Oops!  Let's not forget that before I can distribute those physical CDs, I have to pre-pay royalty/license fees for those 3 bonus songs.
Finally, I will also use some of these pledged funds in support of marketing/promoting the CD, and for getting a wider distribution network going.  This indiegogo project is really intended to jump-start something (hopefully) bigger than this round of pledges and perk shipments.
 
 
What if I don't reach the $5000 funding goal?
My goal of $5000 is calculated to fund a larger cost effective CD manufacturing run and a small promotional campaign.
 
However, rest assured that no matter what level of funsing I reach with this indiegogo project, I will do a manufacturing run of CDs to fulfill everyone's selected perks.

 
Why ""Sings and Swings"" is special...
This new album expresses my love of classic swinging jazz vocal songs, but is intended to contribute some new material to the genre in a compelling way.  If you love old Sinatra, Bennett, Ella, Nat ""King"" Cole and more, I think you'll love the songs I've written and recorded for you.
I am coming to you, my supporters, with the album already recorded.  So the creative ""hard part"" is over.
I just need your help to put these songs in a package that you'll love, and to kick off what I hope will be a success in this exciting phase of my musical career.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>One day in Austin, Texas,</h2>
<p>about a <strong>year</strong> and <strong>6</strong> months ago, <strong>3 </strong>women got together in a living room with a drum set, bass, and guitar, and decided to see what happened: what happened was kind of thrilling, and it made us giggle. Rock and roll music is an amazing thing. It always seems to become fresh and raw again. <br/>      A bunch of rehearsals, gigs, jam sessions, going to see shows together, drinking and talking and spit-balling sessions later, we had <strong>8</strong> songs recorded, and a bunch more written or in the works.<br/>     We were fortunate enough to be able to work with the likes of Jon Sanchez (Roky Erickson, Summer Wardrobe, Alejandro Escovedo), and Louie Lino (Nada Surf, Doug Gillard, Moving Panoramas, New Pornographers). These skilled, talented, and charming fellows helped us make two EP’s that we <strong>love</strong>.<br/>    Which leads us to this: We still owe/require money. Not a ton, but some. Our gigging was actually able to get us a lot of the way there (high five!). But now we are needing another good push to get us to the next level.<br/>    That is where you come in, the remainder of the studio time we still owe for, duplications of records and CD’s, and a little bit of cash to get us on the road to sell these recordings and basically just do what we so much want to do: play for you! Did I mention how much we want to do that? <br/>    We can’t <strong>thank you</strong> enough for your support in whatever amount you feel inspired to give. In return for your hard earned dollars, you will receive our new music in your chosen format and/or original art by Mary Streepy. We are going to press vinyl, because we want something that is going to be around for a while, and hold up to repeated listenings. If we can pull this off, and are able to put out this album and start touring behind it, it will be a dream come true. </p>
<p>Thank you and hugs!     <br/>Your friends, <strong>Queue Queue </strong></p>

After a couple of years Florentine Geiger enriched the songs with her great lyrics. We started to gather a band in June 2016 to craft and arrange the compositions and finalized the songs back in November 2016 during a 3 day session in a remote farm house in the Black Forest away from everything.As a result, we were able to record these Demo tracks :

 
We started recording the album at Kangaroo Digital Studios in February 2017. We were lucky to have a brass section to join us for some of the songs.  The Album : Lost TapesLost tapes will be our first full length album. This album is a mix of our musical inspirations with catchy melodies, colorful arrangements and groovy rhythms which will make you smile, dance and sing along. ​The album will include these 8 songs and an accoustic version of Carry on and Answer in the sky What our goal isIn case the campaign and the album will be a success, we will plan a bigger tour. 2 CD-Release Shows in Prague are already confirmed. What you will get The photos of the perks showed are a work in progress, the final product might change.Album :

<h2>Hello, we’re Everember!</h2>
<p>Everember is an young alternative Christian, Pop/Rock band from the cotton covered lands of Eastern, NC. Since its birth in late 2009, Everember has existed as a mission to be a positive witness through lifestyle and substantial musical production. This isn’t your stereotypical rock band.</p>
<p>Check the music out on <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/everember/id398479464"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">iTunes</a> or <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/everember"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a></p>
<h2>The Campaign</h2>
<p><br/>Everember has been presented the amazing opportunity to record an EP with Grammy nominated and Dove award winning producer/engineer, Travis Wyrick. He has produced and mentored groundbreaking artists such as P.O.D., Pillar, Dolly Parton, Disciple and many others. With your help, Everember can be on that list. Through Wyrick’s professional caliber and connections, we have the potential to not only reach the Christian market, but also to breach the mainstream industry and make a difference. This isn’t just the creation of an EP, it could very well be the start of a full-time career.</p>
<h2>Where does the money go?</h2>
<p>On November 26th, Everember will head on up to Knoxville, TN and begin tracking the EP. The money raised on from this campaign will be used to cover the cost of as much studio time possible. The more time Everember spends in Knoxville, the better this EP will be. In addition to the money that Everember has already raised, the current goal of $9,000 dollars translates into two complete weeks of studio time. The EP can be produced in much less time than that, but hey, let’s shoot for the stars!</p>
<p>-Every dime raised will be spent on as many hours of studio time as possible!-</p>
<h2>*Funding Facts*</h2>
<p>Backers, should this entire project end due to some unforeseen issue that keeps the band from actually recording this EP, your contributions will be reimbursed in full the week of December 9th, 2012. This, however, doesn’t include a rescheduling of studio time due to possible illness, injuries or things of that sort.</p>
<h2>The Product</h2>
<p>After completing this project with Wyrick, Everember will effectively have a professional quality 5-6 song EP ready for some serious promoting. Songs one a level like these can be the best first impression a band could ever have. Some of the possible open doors as a result of this project are; professional touring opportunities, radio interviews, substantial amounts of radio play and a further developed live show. As we've stated before, this could be the first and largest step into creating a career of our a hobby.</p>
<h2>A Final Note</h2>
<p>Please feel free to share this project with your friends and family. We can't thank you enough for all of your support and love over the past three years. We know we can count on you to help us launch this ministry into a career!<br/><br/>For those of you who’ve been keeping up with us for a while, Everember will still be releasing its self produced album, entitled ""Artifacts"", early this January! Thanks for anticipating this along with us!<br/><br/>God Bless you all!<br/>-Everember<br/><br/></p></div>","*Great news!

<p>I'm thrilled with this album and want to make sure it gets heard. I've learned the hard way that if you don't promote an album well, very few people even learn that it is available. But it takes money to promote an album well. It costs thousands of dollars to hire a publicist or send songs to just one radio format, for instance. There's a great team excited about helping me make sure this album gets noticed but I've had to turn many of them down because I can't afford them. </p>
<p>That's where you come in. You could wait for the album to come out in stores but you'll get fewer songs, none of the extras and you won't get the higher quality audio files that are included in the downloads here. When you buy through a store I get less too and I don't even receive that smaller amount from albums sold until months later.</p>
<p>I’ve got some great rewards for individuals, churches and charities -- something for everyone. Check them out over there. --&gt;<br/><br/>You can also invite me to your town - for a Conversation or a concert. You’ll find the details–yep, you guessed it–right over there. --&gt;</p>

I’ll trust you to be fair when estimating that amount.</p>

<h3>Global music with far reaching outcomes</h3>
<p>Hi. I am <strong>Jennifer Lalor</strong> and I would like to share an exciting project with you.  Australian musician <strong>Steve Berry</strong> and I are reaching out for funding for <strong>Jaaleekaay</strong>, an international musical collaboration that provides an opportunity to develop the careers of some fabulous musicians from <strong>The Gambia</strong> in West Africa.</p>
<p><strong>The Gambia</strong> is a country most of us know little about, so I’ll give you some background.  It is the smallest country on the African continent, and one of the poorest countries in the world. It’s sparse natural resources and high unemployment make daily life very difficult, and creates a subsequent dire effect on critical social factors such as health and education. One in ten Gambian children won’t live to see their 5<sup>th</sup> birthday and only 50% of the population over the age of 15 are literate.  It’s clear that improving economic opportunity is crucial to the health, wellbeing and development of the Gambian people.  This project supports that aim by helping two world class Gambian musicians  develop an international career.</p>
<h3>Our vision</h3>
<p><strong>Jaaleekaay</strong> means “Crossing Point” in the West African language of Wolof and represents a powerfully creative meeting between the accomplished Aussie guitarist/producer <strong>Steve Berry</strong> and Gambian musicians <strong>Amadou Suso</strong> (Kora) and <strong>Yusupha Ngum</strong> (vocals).  These musicians first met when Steve travelled to Gambia in February this year, and it was from the creative spark that fired during this connection that <strong>Jaaleekaay</strong> was born.</p>
<p>Our long-term vision with <strong>Jaaleekaay</strong> is to establish a model where collaborations with Western musicians such as Steve create both wonderful music <em>and</em> opportunities for top musicians from economically disadvantaged countries to ply their trade in the wider world.  Such engagement <strong>connects financially poor countries with Western economies</strong> through the culturally rich art of their musicians, and through their art brings significant economic benefits back to their communities at home.</p>
<h3>Our music and background</h3>
<p>The video above showcases <strong>Jaaleekaay’s</strong> wonderful music, and gives you a taste of life in The Gambia, where this project was born.  The track is called <strong>Continental Drift</strong>, and is Jaaleekaay's debut track, recorded in Gambia in February 2013.</p>
<p><strong>Jaaleekaay</strong> first came into being when <strong>Steve Berry</strong>, an award-winning guitarist, composer and producer from Byron Bay, NSW first visited The Gambia in February 2013.  Steve's Australian musical lineage goes back to the emergence of contemporary folk and world music in Australia in the 1980's, having mixed his musical DNA with some of the most innovative Australian acts in the genre, including <strong>Coolangubra, Kev Carmody, Shane Howard</strong> and <strong>Robyn Archer</strong>.  Steve's month long immersion in The Gambia began with an invitation to visit the country by <strong>King Marong</strong>, a Gambian traditional master percussionist now living in Australia.  Through King's many musical contacts in Gambia, Steve met the innovative young Kora player Amadou Suso, and through Amadou the <strong><em>Wolof</em></strong> singer Yusepha Ngum.  From the special musical connection that followed, <strong>Jaaleekaay</strong> emerged.</p>
<p><strong>Amadou Suso</strong>  comes from a long lineage of Kora players, including his father and grandfather before him.  Suso is one of several influential <strong><em>Mandinka</em></strong> Griot names in West Africa, indicating a long family heritage of musicians.  With an ear for the contemporary and global influence, Amadou is now taking his family tradition on the next evolutionary step.</p>
<p><strong>Yusupha Ngum</strong> is a singer from the Sengagambian tradition of <strong>Mbalax</strong>, which means '<em>Rhythm</em>' in his first language of <em><strong>Wolof</strong></em>.  Like Amadou, Yusupha's musical heritage has been handed down through his family, his father also being a singer of reknown in Gambian Mbalax ensembles.  Yusupha himself leads an eight piece  group known as <strong>Jolef</strong>, and along with Amadou is now crossing cultural boundaries, bringing international audiences and Jaaleekaay  his expressive and authentic <em>Wolof</em> vocal style.</p>
<p><strong>Jaaleekaay</strong> represents a convergence of musical expression between Steve, Amadou and Yusupha.  The trio's music embraces parallel influences while crossing between diverse cultural backgrounds.  It is music that adapts and evolves, exploring new territories and dispersing new musical ideas.</p>
<h3>Current campaign </h3>
<p>Later this year our project aims to bring Amadou and Yusupha to Australia for a tour beginning November 2013.  One of our first steps however, is to build on the debut track <strong>Jaaleekaay</strong> recorded in February and <strong>record a full length album</strong>.  To do that we are asking for your support through this campaign.</p>
<p>Our plan is to take advantage of a trip Steve is taking to Germany, and bring Amadou and Yusupha there to spend a couple of weeks with Steve developing and recording their music.</p>
<p>Your support of this phase of the project would enable us to keep the project’s momentum and creative development growing, creating a recording that both promotes this multi cultural and multi-layered project while building a potential income stream for these talented Gambian musicians – income that will have a positive carry on effect for their families and community back home.</p>
<h3>The bigger picture</h3>
<p>It’s no wonder Steve has been inspired to engage in this new project. It is a natural offshoot from his years of experience blending music with philanthropy.  Along with a team of fellow musicians and supporters, over the past decade Steve founded and developed <strong>Music Outback Foundation</strong>, a non-profit organization dedicated to increasing positive outcomes for Indigenous children in remote Australia. Through developing ongoing relationships with schools and communities, Music Outback Foundation has successfully promoted and delivered music based education in over 50 remote Indigenous communities across Australia. This includes the production of nine music festivals known as <strong>Mobfest</strong> – events that see Indigenous kids performing their own songs on the big stage for their friends, family and communities.  To see some awesome examples of Music Outback’s Mobfest events and programs go here:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.musicoutback.com.au"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.musicoutback.com.au</a></p>
<p>With almost 30 years on the Australian music scene, from playing the Sydney Opera House with <strong>Coolangubra</strong> to directing Mobfest events in remote Australia, Steve’s dedicated passion for music and social justice has had a powerful and important impact on the lives of many.</p>
<p><strong>My role</strong> with Jaaleekaay is that of co-producer and organization development. I am a leadership consultant and associate of the Strozzi Institute, USA where I received my embodied leadership training through <strong>Richard Strozzi-Heckler</strong>. I have a passion for exploring human development and the arts in the context of leadership. I am also a former classical dancer and performance artist. I worked for many years with <strong>Anna</strong> and <strong>Daria Halprin</strong> of the Tamalpa Institute in California where I taught on core faculty utilizing movement and the performing arts in education, health and social change. In addition I have worked in live show production in the US and Europe.</p>
<p>What excites me about working with <strong>Jaaleekaay</strong> is the opportunity for my passion for human development, leadership and the arts to support new practices and pathways for social and economic growth for artists in disadvantaged economies.  Besides that, this unique convergence of music that is Jaaleekaay is so fantastic it deserves to be made available to a wide audience of music lovers!</p>
<h3>Budget and Logistics</h3>
<p>For the <strong>Jaaleekaay recording project</strong>, and this – our first crowd funding campaign - we had three scenarios to choose from: recording in Australia, The Gambia or somewhere in between!  The recording needs to take place soon, as it will be used to help build and promote the tour in Australia at the end of the year.   Coming to Australia twice in one year would not be cost effective, and with the Gambian rainy season being mid-year, plus unreliable power supplies and Ramadan being observed in July, recording in Gambia is not the best option either.  However, Steve is already scheduled to be in Germany mid year for a family visit, so we decided the best and most economical option is to bring Amadou and Yusupha to Germany during this time, where they can spend a couple of weeks with Steve recording, using equipment that he brings with him from Australia.</p>
<p>This campaign is reaching out for help with the cost of travel and accommodation  for Amadou and Yusupha, and other necessities for recording while in Germany.</p>
<p><strong><br/>Budget details (Australian dollars):</strong></p>
<p>$2,400  -  Airfare from the Gambia to Frankfurt return for two</p>
<p>$400    -   European Visas, processing fees (including mandatory<br/>              travel to Dakar, Senegal to obtain their visas)</p>

Global music with far reaching outcomes
Hi. I am Jennifer Lalor and I would like to share an exciting project with you.  Australian musician Steve Berry and I are reaching out for funding for Jaaleekaay, an international musical collaboration that provides an opportunity to develop the careers of some fabulous musicians from The Gambia in West Africa.
The Gambia is a country most of us know little about, so I’ll give you some background.  It is the smallest country on the African continent, and one of the poorest countries in the world. It’s sparse natural resources and high unemployment make daily life very difficult, and creates a subsequent dire effect on critical social factors such as health and education. One in ten Gambian children won’t live to see their 5th birthday and only 50% of the population over the age of 15 are literate.  It’s clear that improving economic opportunity is crucial to the health, wellbeing and development of the Gambian people.  This project supports that aim by helping two world class Gambian musicians  develop an international career.
Our vision
Jaaleekaay means “Crossing Point” in the West African language of Wolof and represents a powerfully creative meeting between the accomplished Aussie guitarist/producer Steve Berry and Gambian musicians Amadou Suso (Kora) and Yusupha Ngum (vocals).  These musicians first met when Steve travelled to Gambia in February this year, and it was from the creative spark that fired during this connection that Jaaleekaay was born.
Our long-term vision with Jaaleekaay is to establish a model where collaborations with Western musicians such as Steve create both wonderful music and opportunities for top musicians from economically disadvantaged countries to ply their trade in the wider world.  Such engagement connects financially poor countries with Western economies through the culturally rich art of their musicians, and through their art brings significant economic benefits back to their communities at home.
Our music and background
The video above showcases Jaaleekaay’s wonderful music, and gives you a taste of life in The Gambia, where this project was born.  The track is called Continental Drift, and is Jaaleekaay's debut track, recorded in Gambia in February 2013.
Jaaleekaay first came into being when Steve Berry, an award-winning guitarist, composer and producer from Byron Bay, NSW first visited The Gambia in February 2013.  Steve's Australian musical lineage goes back to the emergence of contemporary folk and world music in Australia in the 1980's, having mixed his musical DNA with some of the most innovative Australian acts in the genre, including Coolangubra, Kev Carmody, Shane Howard and Robyn Archer.  Steve's month long immersion in The Gambia began with an invitation to visit the country by King Marong, a Gambian traditional master percussionist now living in Australia.  Through King's many musical contacts in Gambia, Steve met the innovative young Kora player Amadou Suso, and through Amadou the Wolof singer Yusepha Ngum.  From the special musical connection that followed, Jaaleekaay emerged.
Amadou Suso  comes from a long lineage of Kora players, including his father and grandfather before him.  Suso is one of several influential Mandinka Griot names in West Africa, indicating a long family heritage of musicians.  With an ear for the contemporary and global influence, Amadou is now taking his family tradition on the next evolutionary step.
Yusupha Ngum is a singer from the Sengagambian tradition of Mbalax, which means 'Rhythm' in his first language of Wolof.  Like Amadou, Yusupha's musical heritage has been handed down through his family, his father also being a singer of reknown in Gambian Mbalax ensembles.  Yusupha himself leads an eight piece  group known as Jolef, and along with Amadou is now crossing cultural boundaries, bringing international audiences and Jaaleekaay  his expressive and authentic Wolof vocal style.
Jaaleekaay represents a convergence of musical expression between Steve, Amadou and Yusupha.  The trio's music embraces parallel influences while crossing between diverse cultural backgrounds.  It is music that adapts and evolves, exploring new territories and dispersing new musical ideas.
Current campaign 
Later this year our project aims to bring Amadou and Yusupha to Australia for a tour beginning November 2013.  One of our first steps however, is to build on the debut track Jaaleekaay recorded in February and record a full length album.  To do that we are asking for your support through this campaign.
Our plan is to take advantage of a trip Steve is taking to Germany, and bring Amadou and Yusupha there to spend a couple of weeks with Steve developing and recording their music.
Your support of this phase of the project would enable us to keep the project’s momentum and creative development growing, creating a recording that both promotes this multi cultural and multi-layered project while building a potential income stream for these talented Gambian musicians – income that will have a positive carry on effect for their families and community back home.
The bigger picture
It’s no wonder Steve has been inspired to engage in this new project. It is a natural offshoot from his years of experience blending music with philanthropy.  Along with a team of fellow musicians and supporters, over the past decade Steve founded and developed Music Outback Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to increasing positive outcomes for Indigenous children in remote Australia. Through developing ongoing relationships with schools and communities, Music Outback Foundation has successfully promoted and delivered music based education in over 50 remote Indigenous communities across Australia. This includes the production of nine music festivals known as Mobfest – events that see Indigenous kids performing their own songs on the big stage for their friends, family and communities.  To see some awesome examples of Music Outback’s Mobfest events and programs go here:
http://www.musicoutback.com.au
With almost 30 years on the Australian music scene, from playing the Sydney Opera House with Coolangubra to directing Mobfest events in remote Australia, Steve’s dedicated passion for music and social justice has had a powerful and important impact on the lives of many.
My role with Jaaleekaay is that of co-producer and organization development. I am a leadership consultant and associate of the Strozzi Institute, USA where I received my embodied leadership training through Richard Strozzi-Heckler. I have a passion for exploring human development and the arts in the context of leadership. I am also a former classical dancer and performance artist. I worked for many years with Anna and Daria Halprin of the Tamalpa Institute in California where I taught on core faculty utilizing movement and the performing arts in education, health and social change. In addition I have worked in live show production in the US and Europe.
What excites me about working with Jaaleekaay is the opportunity for my passion for human development, leadership and the arts to support new practices and pathways for social and economic growth for artists in disadvantaged economies.  Besides that, this unique convergence of music that is Jaaleekaay is so fantastic it deserves to be made available to a wide audience of music lovers!
Budget and Logistics
For the Jaaleekaay recording project, and this – our first crowd funding campaign - we had three scenarios to choose from: recording in Australia, The Gambia or somewhere in between!  The recording needs to take place soon, as it will be used to help build and promote the tour in Australia at the end of the year.   Coming to Australia twice in one year would not be cost effective, and with the Gambian rainy season being mid-year, plus unreliable power supplies and Ramadan being observed in July, recording in Gambia is not the best option either.  However, Steve is already scheduled to be in Germany mid year for a family visit, so we decided the best and most economical option is to bring Amadou and Yusupha to Germany during this time, where they can spend a couple of weeks with Steve recording, using equipment that he brings with him from Australia.
This campaign is reaching out for help with the cost of travel and accommodation  for Amadou and Yusupha, and other necessities for recording while in Germany.
Budget details (Australian dollars):
$2,400  -  Airfare from the Gambia to Frankfurt return for two
$400    -   European Visas, processing fees (including mandatory              travel to Dakar, Senegal to obtain their visas)
$900    -   Accommodation and work space in Germany for 16 days
$300    -   Ground Transport                                                              
$500    -   Hire of equipment (specifically equipment too bulky to bring from Australia              such as mic stands, speakers etc.)
$500    -   Food & living expenses_____$5000  -    TOTAL COST
We are crowdfunding for $5,000 to help make the development and recording phase of the Jaaleekaay project viable (Phase 1). Your help with this phase will be instrumental in kick-starting the greater project into motion. Any funding we receive beyond our goal of $A5,000, will go directly toward the expense of bringing Amadou and Yusupha to Australia at the end of the year for the Australian tour (Phase 2).

We have already received great encouragement from three significant music festivals in Australia just with our debut track.

I'm Santiago, an actor and songwriter from Colombia. I have been in London for 5 years and I've made music for different projects in that time. One of my main collaborators is Camilo Menjura: award-winning singer, musician and producer, also from Colombia. This time, Camilo and I are coming together to create something that I have been dreaming about and planning for a while: recording a collection of songs inspired in different genres of the Latin American folklore, with lyrics in English. 
In order to give every track its particular sound, we will be joined by some talented guest musicians (details to be announced).
As a foreign artist in the UK, one of my passions is to find new ways to bring my own cultural background into the work I do. This is the main idea behind 'Flowers': to introduce the sounds of Latin folklore in songs that are accessible to English speakers.
'Flowers' is my first album, and I need some financial support to make it happen. That's why I would like to ask for your help. Join this campaign and get some great rewards in return!
 

Here's the last project that Camilo and I worked on together: 'The Other Side'. This song and its music video were recorded entirely in isolation during the first months of lockdown (A re-mixed, masterised version of this track will be included in the album).
 
Here's a sample of Camilo's album 'Loop Explorations', which he recorded and produced in 2018 - 2019.

 


Here is a detailed breakdown of the the project's budget:

Soon Phil decided to research the history of Folk and Bluegrass music in the city and learned of its rich and vibrant history. And so an idea was born. Union brewery was chosen as a location for the event because of its quality beer and its local ties. The Believe in music charity was chosen to be a beneficiary of the event becasue where would music be without brite and curious music students.</p>
<p>It's not often remembered today, but in the '50s and '60s, Baltimore was a major center for bluegrass music. A Baltimore band, Earl Taylor and the Stoney Mountain Boys, was the first bluegrass act to ever play Carnegie Hall. It was in Baltimore rowhouses that Hazel Dickens first met Mike Seeger, who co-founded the New Lost City Ramblers, a well-known old-time revival band, and Alice Gerrard, with whom Dickens formed the first major female bluegrass duo. And it was here that Del McCoury first met bluegrass godfather Bill Monroe and got the break that changed his life.</p>
<p>Back in 1966, ""The Streets of Baltimore"" was one of the biggest hits on country radio. Despite Chet Atkins' string-sweetened countrypolitan arrangement, Bobby Bare's warm baritone made Tompall Glaser and Harlan Howard's lyrics ring true. Like the characters in the song, hundreds of thousands of rural Southerners moved to northern cities in search of work from the 1930s to the '60s--a migration that changed Baltimore forever.</p>
<p>When these Southerners moved, they brought their music with them, and for white Southerners that meant hillbilly music--a catch-all term encompassing the mountain ballads, old-time string bands, bluegrass, and Grand Ole Opry country that Appalachian people scrambled together whenever they pulled a guitar or fiddle out of its case. And it's in that music we can most readily discern how those mountain immigrants remade themselves to fit Baltimore--and remade Baltimore to fit themselves.</p>
<p>Even today, that Southern Appalachian influence is part of what makes Baltimore so different from other stops on the Washington-to-Boston Amtrak line. When people talk about Baltimoreans' earthy frankness, their stubborn nontrendiness, and their willingness to dance at the drop of a hat, they're often referring to lingering hillbilly traits. From meat-and-potatoes diners to John Waters' poor white film characters to the Deer Creek Fiddlers convention, the mountains still affect Baltimore culture.</p>
<p>When young people fled the mountains in search of better jobs, they had a choice of destinations. Cincinnati was the most popular, followed closely by Baltimore, Chicago, Washington, Columbus, and Detroit. Most often, the new migrants chose the town where relatives or friends had already landed. That was the case for Dickens, whose older sister Velvie was in Hampden, and for Hensley, whose divorced mother had moved to Dundalk.</p>
<p>When these Appalachian refugees poured into Baltimore in the '40s and '50s, they were not met with welcoming arms; rather, they were usually were shunted into bottom-rung industrial jobs and ""hillbilly ghettos"" in Dundalk, Hampden, Highlandtown, Lower Charles Village, Middle River, and elsewhere.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hailing from the rolling green hills of Berkshire Country, Massachusetts, The Interlopers are a 6 piece band, currently comprised of Curtis Kelley, Nick Veinoglou, Ariel Shrum, Jakob Rabitsch, Nick Frenay ad Kama Bell. 2012 marked the release of their debut self produced album, “Don’t Forget to Breathe” as well as a wildly successful summer of over 40 performances. Now moved out to Boston, the band is expanding it’s sound, with the addition of Keys and saxophone, writing new material, and of course working tirelessly to spread the music around the country.                                              2013 has offered them their chance! Now working with a booking agency, they will be booking all over the East Coast, however have only one problem; Transport and the funds necessary to provide it. They now call upon their fans and friends to support their journey through their “Get on the Road” Campaign 2013.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As city dwellers know very well, owning vehicles can be very expensive, especially as collage students. We currently don't have our own means of transport, so for local gigs we will be relying on Taxi's and Buses. We would need 2 taxis to transport 6 humans and a band worth of gear, traveling an average distance of 6-12 miles to play in the Boston, Cambridge area. Each taxi would cost roughly $60 bucks round trip, 2 taxi’s adding up to $120. We would be performing roughly 2 shows a month in Boston, and the rest will be outside the city, requiring us to put a down payment on our own transport (be it a van or a trailer). So we are asking to raise $4000 which is enough put a down payment on a van or purchase our very own gear trailer! If you pledge, we will be giving away anything from CD’s, tickets and posters, to private performances and personal songs, written, recorded and filmed in HD for our fans that pledge large sums!  With your help we can finally get our music to those who want to listen. If we exceed our amount we could even get enough funds to own our very own van! For further information, check out the campaign video!</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There is a point in a song where the energy reaches a climax, and a moment that precedes it where every member can’t help but look at on another, their eyes reflecting one another’s excitement for that incredible moment to come. But every once in a while, a guitar cable pops out just before that moment is reached, the excitement and collective enthusiasm comes crashing down…We now find ourselves in a similar situation, having found for our chance to give our music mobility, but needing your support to reach our goal. These past 4 months, we have worked incredibly hard, finding one of a kind friends to enrich our music, venues to host it, and resources to lead a musical career of love and longevity. We are ready to actualize out full potential, and with your help, we can. If you extend a loving hand out to us, you will not only help us share our music with our fans and friends, but you will be part of making our dreams of performing all over the country a reality. You will instill confidence in music’s ability to unite people, create everlasting bonds, and of course, have our love, our groove and our gratitude for as long as we continue to make music together. </p>

<p>If you are unfamiliar with our music, we'd be honored if you'd check out our record ""Don't Forget to Breathe"", or any of our latest posts and take a chance to be inspired! However, times are tough and if you cannot help by pledging to our campaign, please use Indiegogo's share tools, post our campaign on facebook, twitter, share it via email and extend it to those you think could provide financial assitance. we thank you fro the bottom of our hearts for any contribution you can make and we look forward to be seeing you down the road.</p>

<ul>
<li class=""western"">Rob: vocals, guitar, songs</li>
<li class=""western"">Cathy: fiddle, viola, piano</li>
<li class=""western"">Tim: double bass, bass guitar, piano, occasional songs</li>
<li class=""western"">Johnnie: drums, percussion</li>
</ul><p class=""western"">We all work full-time, and spend most of our spare time creating and performing music.</p>
<p class=""western"">Over the past few months, we've spent many evenings and weekends recording our first album.  (You can <a href=""http://www.soundcloud.com/drivenserious"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">hear some samples on our Soundcloud page</a> or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sE2dqoalbP4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">watch the video for our single</a>.)  We've funded the recording through gigs across the North East, and we've been helped by some amazing people who've contributed their skills to make this project happen, either for free or at reduced rates.</p>
<p class=""western"">We're really happy with this CD, and we'd like as many people as possible to be able to hear it.</p>
<p class=""western"">There is one final step, though: getting the CDs duplicated.  We don't want to just produce 50 or 100 CDRs that we wouldn't be happy with the quality of - we want to aim for success.  So this campaign is to raise the money to get at least 500 high-quality CDs that can be sold across the North East and the world; and if possible to make a bit more to advertise the CD as widely as possible.</p>
<h3 class=""western"">What We Need</h3>
<p class=""western"">Our target of £600 will pay for 500 copies of the album to be glass-mastered and reproduced, with an 8-page booklet laid out by Dave Marsdin and containing lyrics to all the songs, original art by Sara Borges and photos by Paula Smart.</p>
<p class=""western"">If we raise more money than this, we have various plans:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""western"">An extra £120 would get 1000 copies of the CD, so we can get it out to even more places.</li>
<li class=""western"">An extra £175 would buy a month's advertising in NARC and on kyeo.tv</li>
<li class=""western"">An extra £475 would buy a month's advertising in The Crack.</li>
<li class=""western"">If we go far beyond this, it'll help fund future band projects and a future album.</li>
</ul><p class=""western"">If we raise less than the target, then it will still go towards CD duplication - we might have to get fewer copies or dig deeply into our own pockets.</p>
<h3 class=""western"">What You Get</h3>
<p class=""western"">A pledge of £10 gets you a copy of the album, posted to you (or picked up at either of the album launches).  If you might be buying our album anyway, you might as well buy it now and help us at the same time!</p>
<p class=""western"">If money is really tight, then our double-A-side single Accidental Crimes/Buddhas in the Emptiness is available for just £3.  (This mix of Buddhas in the Emptiness is not on the album, so it's just for you.)</p>
<p class=""western"">Then there are a few ways of getting a unique piece of Driven Serious.  You can get us to write you a song.  You can get Cathy to knit you a scarf.  Or you can get us to do a unique gig for you and whoever you invite, in a time and place of your choosing (but you will need to pay travel expenses and accommodation if you take us far from the North East!).</p>
<p class=""western"">Our top item is the original oil painting by Sara Borges that is the album cover.  It would really break our hearts to part with this, hence the price; but we would be glad to see it go to someone who gave us that much support.  £100 of the money from this perk would go as additional payment to Sara; so with this perk you get to support two local artists at once!</p>
<p class=""western"">Then there's that other item.  We don't talk about that one.</p>

<p class=""western"">Our album is original music straight from our hearts. We know that we are blessed to be in this position; to have met each other and be involved in this project.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Peter Reynolds is listed in the Guinness Book of Records for having composed the shortest ever opera. Yet despite being a highly talented Welsh Composer, he was quite unassuming when it came to the promotion of his own music. A typical characteristic of Peter Reynolds was his selflessness, giving so much of this time to the support and promotion of others. This included founding the PM Music Group which was devoted to performing contemporary music, an advocate of the work of Ty Cerdd, artistic programming music concerts and festivals, to his support of young composers around Wales, organising and running workshops, visiting schools, and teaching privately and at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama.</p>
<p>In 2016 Peter sadly and suddenly died, leaving so many bereft. For those of us who attended his memorial service in Cardiff, the amount of people there from all over the UK, and of all ages, spoke volumes.</p>
<p>Peter Reynolds was my compositional mentor and good friend for a number of years. This disc which we'd like to release called <strong>Penllyn</strong>, is an opportunity to bring Peter's music to a much wider public. Very few of his solo piano works are recorded, and I've been on a mission to track down his scores over the last few years since his death. This will be the <strong>World Premiere</strong> recording of the collected solo piano music by Peter Reynolds, and will be performed by Duncan Honeybourne, for whom Peter composed and dedicated his final solo piano work, <strong>Penllyn.</strong></p>
<p>In collaboration with the composer David Power, another friend of Peter's, we're project managing this CD along with Duncan, to bring you Peter's music. For a person who gave so much, we'd like to create this disc for Peter. We've two recording sessions in the diary which I'll be producing: 24th of October, and the 14th of November 2021. The CD will be released in Spring 2022 on the Prima Facie label.</p>
<p>For all those who knew Peter in some way, we'd like to ask that you help us bring this recording to fruition, through buying a copy of the CD in advance, or making a donation. It is an opportunity for us to give something back to Peter.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Peter Reynolds gave so much to thousands of people throughout his life, and yet he was very unassuming when it came to his own compositions. Whether teaching, conducting, ensemble manager, writing programme notes and so much more, he had a significant impact upon the classical music industry in Wales and far beyond. This is an opportunity for us to give something back, and to hear Peter's music once again.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It has been a challenge to track down Peter's music, for not all of it was listed on his personal website. However, works came out of the woodwork, often gifts he'd written for special people in his life.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>For all of you who knew and loved Peter, please do spread the word and share this Crowd Funding appeal. So many I am sure will want to support this project, and if this gets off to a good start, I hope to then manage a follow up disc exploring some of Peter's as yet unrecorded chamber music too.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Peter Reynolds is listed in the Guinness Book of Records for having composed the shortest ever opera. Yet despite being a highly talented Welsh Composer, he was quite unassuming when it came to the promotion of his own music. A typical characteristic of Peter Reynolds was his selflessness, giving so much of this time to the support and promotion of others. This included founding the PM Music Group which was devoted to performing contemporary music, an advocate of the work of Ty Cerdd, artistic programming music concerts and festivals, to his support of young composers around Wales, organising and running workshops, visiting schools, and teaching privately and at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama.
In 2016 Peter sadly and suddenly died, leaving so many bereft. For those of us who attended his memorial service in Cardiff, the amount of people there from all over the UK, and of all ages, spoke volumes.
Peter Reynolds was my compositional mentor and good friend for a number of years. This disc which we'd like to release called Penllyn, is an opportunity to bring Peter's music to a much wider public. Very few of his solo piano works are recorded, and I've been on a mission to track down his scores over the last few years since his death. This will be the World Premiere recording of the collected solo piano music by Peter Reynolds, and will be performed by Duncan Honeybourne, for whom Peter composed and dedicated his final solo piano work, Penllyn.
In collaboration with the composer David Power, another friend of Peter's, we're project managing this CD along with Duncan, to bring you Peter's music. For a person who gave so much, we'd like to create this disc for Peter. We've two recording sessions in the diary which I'll be producing: 24th of October, and the 14th of November 2021. The CD will be released in Spring 2022 on the Prima Facie label.
For all those who knew Peter in some way, we'd like to ask that you help us bring this recording to fruition, through buying a copy of the CD in advance, or making a donation. It is an opportunity for us to give something back to Peter.

It focuses on the perspective of the prodigal son (representing those who stray from God) and his brother (the faithful, yet unfulfilled believer) to tell a compelling audio-visual story about the present state of the world and church.</p>
<p>At times it will appear like a concert, others like a musical. You may think you're at a poetry slam, or maybe a hip hop cipher. These elements seamlessly flow in and out of one another weaving you into this story that we believe is for such a time as this. We can't wait to share it with you!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why are we doing this?</strong></p>
<p>As we look around us, we see more and more people giving up on institutionalized religion and tradional Christianity. Like you, we've seen and felt what it's become, and can tell that much of it simply couldn't be what God desires of ""<em>His</em>"" Church. We, like so many others, have experienced a form of Godliness, but a complete and utter lack of POWER, INTEGIRTY, UNITY, and VISION. There obviously has to be more; and as many of us have asked God to show us what His true intentions and will are, we believe He is beginning to show us. We believe this is a fulfillment of a ""Promise"" he has made to us. Greater works, more than we can ask or think, things that eyes haven't seen...LOVE. These are the things our hearts desire to see realized for the Church. That's why we believe He has given us...His Promise.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What's the vision/mission?</strong></p>
<p>Our vision for this tour is to cultivate hope in attendees through <em>Inspired</em> creative expression via the story of the Prodigal. We want to release a new sound that affects our culture causing people to see things as God sees them and not as the media, government, music industry, or even the ""church"" at large portrays them. Our goal is to awaken, inspire and share a hope in a living God and real Father who loves them and will make good on the promise He has made to them as individuals as well as mankind as a whole.</p>
<p>The mission wil be to travel to cities and exemplify the nature of Christ as we serve communities, connect, and share this production. There is a ""movement"" (cliche I know!) manifesting around concept and we simply want to seek God corporately while being open to connect and share while we steward this call.</p>
<p>We are all ""Products of Promise"" and we want to receive and walk in our destined promise and help others to do the same.</p>

<p><b>Our
Goal:</b></p>

County.  This new space is approximately 800sq ft and newly
remodeled.  It features polished concrete floors, 15' exposed industrial
ceilings, and floor to ceiling windows for plenty of natural light.  It is
located on Ventura Blvd directly off the 101 freeway in a modern and beautiful building
that has recently won a triple diamond award for design. </p>
<p>We will provide low cost rental time
to photographers and students that may not have regular access to professional
grade studio equipment and space.  This new space will also be open to
educators and instructors at a discounted price for workshops and education.</p><p><b>Who we are:</b><br/></p>
<p>We are photographers from the Los
Angeles area and we are passionate about what we do.  We love photography
of all genres, learning, and providing assistance to those with equal passion
and eagerness to learn.</p>
<p>Since starting our photography
business, it has been our biggest drive to expand and create a business in
which other photographers, can use to create and grow their artistic
skills.  The art of photography is a very expensive practice and we feel
being able to provide a comfortable, private, and professional working space
will help enhance the local artistic community as well as helping other
photographers achieve their creative goals.</p>
<p>Your contributions will help
directly impact these goals.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Studio Supplies and Equipment.  </b>This portion will provide things like office supplies,
     equipment, small storage, dispensable and consumables.</li>
<li>
<b>Renovation of the current space. </b> A small portion will be dedicated to providing a space
     with a more creative and artistic feel.  This will include paint,
     lights, etc.</li>
<li>
<b>Marketing. </b>
     Helping us spread the word to local photographers and educators.</li>

campaign does not reach its 100% goal, your contributions still impact these

<p>We have attempted to gather unique
gift ideas for every contribution.  We have collected a grab bag of gift
resources that have been reserved for each tier level ranging from cards, to
photographic prints and services,  but the biggest thing we could ever
offer is our eternal gratitude for believing in us and helping us achieve our
dreams. </p>
<p>We will also provide every

<p>My name is T.S. Moth and Transdusk is my solo project/music baby. To be more succinct, it is my life's work. The music is of the industrial metal persuasion but I like to think of it as a bit more than that (not that I mind being labeled as such) so I tend to refer to it as 'thrash wave'. </p>
<p>It could be said that I have a very strong DIY ethic and do all my own writing, recording, artwork, promotion, and more.

But now that I'm gaining a bit of traction and the scope of this album is greater than the last, I can't go it alone!</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">We're Echo Black from New York City and we are humbly asking for your help. We create music because it is what we NEED to do to communicate and to survive. Unfortunately, what we need doesn't always bring us financial stability or the means necessary to continue. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Before we get into what we're asking of you, let us give you some background on Echo Black in case you are new to us:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We are a pop/rock four piece band based out of New York City/New Jersey. We have all been making music for quite a few years now, but, as this band, we've only been together since March of 2015. In that time, we've released 3 singles with accompanying music videos, toured the country and been featured on such publications as Billboard, AP, FUSE, and Revolver. We believe in the fusion of fashion, music, creativity, political and social awareness, and intelligence. We make music you can feel; music that is meant to stick around. Check out ""Chemicals"" and see what we mean! </p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/BVsA--Msa8k?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We have done a lot in a short time, and... spent a lot... in a short time. We have the most important thing: MOMENTUM. We have more music written and, it seems, the demand for its release is high. We're coming up to a period where we feel that frequent touring will be able to sustain us in the near future, but we need to get to that point. If we lose this momentum, we will have to start from scratch. And that will bury us. Without your help, we'll be unable to release our album until 2018. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">To be completely upfront with you all, in order for us to have released the singles we released and back it all with the right promo, we had to spend 15,000 over 4 months. And it truly tapped us out. We're musicians, yes, but we're also bartenders, graphic designers, retail clerks, etc. Music is expensive and all we want to do is make it and play it for you.  </p>

</div></div>","We're Echo Black from New York City and we are humbly asking for your help. We create music because it is what we NEED to do to communicate and to survive. Unfortunately, what we need doesn't always bring us financial stability or the means necessary to continue. 
Before we get into what we're asking of you, let us give you some background on Echo Black in case you are new to us:
We are a pop/rock four piece band based out of New York City/New Jersey. We have all been making music for quite a few years now, but, as this band, we've only been together since March of 2015. In that time, we've released 3 singles with accompanying music videos, toured the country and been featured on such publications as Billboard, AP, FUSE, and Revolver. We believe in the fusion of fashion, music, creativity, political and social awareness, and intelligence. We make music you can feel; music that is meant to stick around. Check out ""Chemicals"" and see what we mean! 

We have done a lot in a short time, and... spent a lot... in a short time. We have the most important thing: MOMENTUM. We have more music written and, it seems, the demand for its release is high. We're coming up to a period where we feel that frequent touring will be able to sustain us in the near future, but we need to get to that point. If we lose this momentum, we will have to start from scratch. And that will bury us. Without your help, we'll be unable to release our album until 2018. 
To be completely upfront with you all, in order for us to have released the singles we released and back it all with the right promo, we had to spend 15,000 over 4 months. And it truly tapped us out. We're musicians, yes, but we're also bartenders, graphic designers, retail clerks, etc. Music is expensive and all we want to do is make it and play it for you.  
We just need a push... to get to that point where the music sustains itself. And, guys... we're SO close. We are at the boiling point. It's now or never.
Again, we are humbly asking for your help to get us to that next level. We do what we do for the fans and the listeners and we feel that our music has an important place. We have to believe that, or else, why keep making it?

1.   Finish out our album: we have 5 more tracks to record
2.   Shoot one hell of a music video for our next single to help push the album.
3.   Get on the road for most of 2017 to bring our show to YOU
It is possible, we know it is. But we need you in order to make it happen. 

$5,000 will go towards producing, mixing, and mastering the remainder of the album
$1,000 will go towards pressing the physical CDs
$3,000 will go towards the most epic video we've made yet
$1,000 will go towards the start of promo and getting us on the road
Any extra money we make will go towards the video and further promotion and will only increase our momentum. Believe me, we are still putting money towards our dreams. But if we do it ourselves, our timeline will totally bury us.   


Here's the exciting part! 
We're offering some pretty cool sh*t in order to further entice you to help us out! 
Want to hear the album before anyone else? Done. 
Want to come hang out in the studio with us while we record? We'd love to have you!

<h3>Who is this weirdo, and why should I give her $$?</h3>
<p>My name is Lisa Koch, and I'm a Seattle musician, originally from Ashland, OR.  I have been lucky enough to make my living as an a musician, actor, sketch comic, writer and producer.  I have recorded 4 solo CD's, and am just about ready to release #5.  For those of you who have requested that I ""just sing"", this latest offering is love songs, song I love, and songs that inspire (only one comedy song, and that's about the vile-smelling natural spring water in my hometown).  I have self-financed all previous recordings, but could really use a little help with this one.  That's where you come in!  I'm on track for an early May release.  Help me meet my goal!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Is that like in soccer?</h3>
<p>Uh, no.  My goal is $15,000.  That pays for musicians, studio costs, mastering, graphic design, licensing fees, and duplication.  And for coffee, lots and lots of coffee.  If I don't meet my goal, I'll use every penny raised toward the CD.  If I exceed the goal (I can dream, can't I?), all funds will go toward my next creative endeavor (music, stage, writing).  I'll send updates to keep you all in the loop.</p>
<h3>I thought CD's were extinct, like 8-tracks, and the Dodo.</h3>
<p>No, CD's are still around.  Usually sold at gigs, where they can be autographed, and then sold decades later, after being appraised for 1.2 million dollars on ""Antiques Roadshow"".</p>
<h3>What's on your CD?</h3>
<p>11 songs-- a mix of originals and re-imagined cover tunes.  The title song ""Enjoy the Ride"" is dedicated to my dear departed father, Frank.  We lost him in 2009, and miss him every day.  The song is about feeling gratitude, not being afraid, taking risks, and living large every day.  And no time like the present, holy crapola.   ""This is precisely the time when artists go to work"" (thanks, Toni Morrison).</p>

<p>This Boom Box project is a life and land reclamation project, bringing the music back to the people. Inspired by the public jams that I have done previously in Portland and Chicago, and the continuous reminders from the music industry (even on the independent level) that the middle man (in the music industry) impedes and stains the relationship between the artists and the crowd; this project is meant to celebrate the absence of this vampire, and bring the performer and the people more intimately connected. This project will be made in to a documentary.</p>
<p>This Boom Box Project will kickoff at SXSW 2013 in Austin TX.  On various corners, streetparks, college campuses, and maybe by a few creeks, this project will roll through many different towns after SXSW in to Summer 2013.  The only means will be a boom box, a microphone, and a dunny with a dream.  The boom box will be for land and water, having a wagon for the land and a flotation raft custom built for the water (pools and creeks, and maybe even puddles).  There will also be surprise guests at almost every location.</p>

<i><b>CRACK!</b></i><br/>
</h3><p>
Turns out that’s the sound a double bass makes when the wood splits open
(mid-rehearsal, of course). I was pretty mortified – people stared, I freaked
out a little bit (okay, maybe more than a little bit). It was great, and
probably highly entertaining for everyone (in a horrifying sort of way), except
for the fact that I now have a broken bass. As both a grad student studying music
performance and professional musician, it is sort of putting a damper on my
life.</p>I believe that music exists for the community surrounding
it. I am a musician dedicated to serving that community, by performing 
music in both traditional and non-traditional ways and spaces. This 
music can reach anyone, and it is our job as musicians to make that 
possible. Unfortunately, since the Chicago winter destroyed my bass, and the cost of fixing the
instrument is beyond what the instrument is worth, I cannot do this job. Some people have totaled
cars. I totaled a bass.<br/><br/><p>While I would like to continue to bring music into the
community through performance, share my passion for classical music with the
world around me, and pass my knowledge onto the next generation of musicians, I
simply cannot do these things with a broken instrument. This is where you come in. By
donating to this campaign, you will be helping me purchase a new instrument,
but more than that, you will be helping bring music into people’s lives. <br/><br/></p><h3>
<b>A Bit About Me</b>
</h3>
<p>I was born and raised in Alexandria, VA, and began my musical
career as a violinist at the age of nine. It was not until my freshman year of
college that I picked up classical bass, thinking it was a kind of hobby.
However, things didn’t go as planned – I fell in love with the instrument, and
pursued it seriously, practicing like a maniac.  In the five years since,
I have attended two summer festivals in North Carolina – Eastern Music Festival
and Brevard Music Festival, and performed in master classes for Ranaan Meyer,
Leonid Finkelshteyn, Robert Nairn, and others. Additionally, I was a founding
teacher of the Bass Academy at the Music Academy of Eastern North Carolina, and
performed with the Fayetteville Symphony and the Raleigh Chamber Players. Since
moving to Chicago to pursue a Masters Degree in Bass Performance at DePaul
University, I have helped found the halsted eight ensemble, and will be
performing more chamber music with several groups this spring at venues around
the city.</p>

</p><h3><b>The Impact</b></h3>
<p>In addition to providing me an instrument with which to
launch my career and bring music into my community, you will be giving me an
opportunity to connect with you. Music is a conversation between composer,
performer, and audience, and it is not complete without that audience. I would
like to see that conversation more actively recognized in classical music, and
I think this project has the potential to make that happen through the resulting performances.<br/></p>

for the fact that I now have a broken bass. As both a grad student studying music
performance and professional musician, it is sort of putting a damper on my
life.I believe that music exists for the community surrounding
it. I am a musician dedicated to serving that community, by performing 
music in both traditional and non-traditional ways and spaces. This 
music can reach anyone, and it is our job as musicians to make that 
possible. Unfortunately, since the Chicago winter destroyed my bass, and the cost of fixing the
instrument is beyond what the instrument is worth, I cannot do this job. Some people have totaled
cars. I totaled a bass.While I would like to continue to bring music into the
community through performance, share my passion for classical music with the
world around me, and pass my knowledge onto the next generation of musicians, I
simply cannot do these things with a broken instrument. This is where you come in. By
donating to this campaign, you will be helping me purchase a new instrument,
but more than that, you will be helping bring music into people’s lives. 
A Bit About Me

I was born and raised in Alexandria, VA, and began my musical
career as a violinist at the age of nine. It was not until my freshman year of
college that I picked up classical bass, thinking it was a kind of hobby.
However, things didn’t go as planned – I fell in love with the instrument, and
pursued it seriously, practicing like a maniac.  In the five years since,
I have attended two summer festivals in North Carolina – Eastern Music Festival
and Brevard Music Festival, and performed in master classes for Ranaan Meyer,
Leonid Finkelshteyn, Robert Nairn, and others. Additionally, I was a founding
teacher of the Bass Academy at the Music Academy of Eastern North Carolina, and
performed with the Fayetteville Symphony and the Raleigh Chamber Players. Since
moving to Chicago to pursue a Masters Degree in Bass Performance at DePaul
University, I have helped found the halsted eight ensemble, and will be
performing more chamber music with several groups this spring at venues around
the city.

The Impact
In addition to providing me an instrument with which to
launch my career and bring music into my community, you will be giving me an
opportunity to connect with you. Music is a conversation between composer,
performer, and audience, and it is not complete without that audience. I would
like to see that conversation more actively recognized in classical music, and
I think this project has the potential to make that happen through the resulting performances.

I am a country rock/pop independent recording artist from New Zealand. I have great dreams to become internationally known  as an artist in this genre. I have been professional for three years and recorded my debut album 'Here We Go' (See <a href=""http://www.jodydireen.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.jodydireen.com</a> to listen to samples) in February 2011, it launched in NZ April 2011 and has opened many doors for me since. Here are a few of the major events I have been involved in this year:</p><p> </p><p>- Placed third in NZ's Good Morning Find A Star Competition (aired on live national TV) judged by national and international judges.</p><p>- Performed at the Big Night In concert at Dunedin, NZ's Forsyth Barr Stadium. I performed two songs backed by a 19 piece band (a cover &amp; Comin To Town) &amp; 26 000 people turned up to watch the show so was a biggy! AMAZING experience! </p><p>- A support act for the Waratahs (well known NZ band) at the Mandeville Music Festival.</p><p>-Performed Comin To Town on national TV again (Good Morning)</p><p>-Offered first international record deal - however am remaining as an independent artist for now. </p><p><br/></p><p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#ff0000"">PLEASE NOTE THAT DONATIONS ARE IN USD!!! $10 US = $13.29 NZD :)</font></p><p> </p><p>I am REALLY determined to take my career to the next level. I would love to release my first official single in NZ and Australia in the new year and to do this I need a music video! Comin To Town is the single that I want to release (see video). It is a fresh, up beat, international sounding country rock song. I have had great feedback on the song from the general pubic, my fans and national and international music professionals. The music video will be sexy, have attitude, a little bit of humor &amp; make viewers want to press the reply button! I am hoping to shoot the video mid February 2012 around my home town, Wanaka, NZ. </p><p> </p><p>I strongly believe that I can make my dreams become reality, knowing that your money has gone into it will motivate me even more! It will mean soo much to me to know that once its happened - YOU helped me get there. If you do decide to donate some of your hard earned money towards my campaign I know you wont regret it because I will make sure the final product will be one that eveyone will enjoy - you will be proud of being part of its succcess!</p><p> </p><p>If you donate please add me as a personal friend on facebook and send me a message letting me know that is what you did as I want to get to know you - I think your generosity is amazing! I was fairly standoffish at first about the whole fundraising thing - I almost 'feel bad' doing this! But I know now that I cant do it all on my own in the time that I need to....I have invested around $50 000 of my own money into my career already &amp; I dont have an endless supply!</p><p>So this is a brief overview of my story and why I need your help!! I promise I wont let you down! A HUGE THANK YOU to you:) X</p><p> </p><h3> The Impact</h3><p> Firstly, the music video will have an impact on anybody who views it. A positive impact. Comin To Town is a feel-good song, bringing about good emotion when people listen to it. Having a video to go with it will enhance this emotion even further! This is one thing I am always striving for with my music - is to write songs that make people feel good! </p><p>A major goal of mine is to help promote modern, up beat country rock music internationally as well as NZ. Particularly NZ because a) it is my home country and b) this kind of music has very little exposure here. I find this hard to believe as there is a huge amout of people here that LOVE the very genre! People dont want to have to fly to Australia or the states to go to a country music concert/festival. It needs to start happening here. The country music industry in NZ is almost non-existent - BUT there are the young artists here to help fuel &amp; build the industry - the issue is, is that they all end up dissapearing overseas in seach of a country music career! The music video will play a small part in helping to build an industry in NZ so our young artists who want to be able to have a country music career in NZ dont HAVE to head over seas.  It will be a huge marketing tool to help get my name out there as well as expose the genre to people who dont realise how far country music has come since the legendary days of Merel Haggard etc. </p><p> </p><p>Country music has soul &amp; a country song is NEVER meaningless - country music can help people. </p><p> </p><p>International:</p><p>Even though a major goal of mine is to help get modern, country rock/pop music cranking in NZ, I will go wherever there are oppurtunities for my career. If I need to go to Australia or America to push my career along I will as this will have a indirect influence on country music in NZ - because I am a kiwi! </p><p> </p><p>Lastly it will have a positive impact on you! Knowing that you have helped me along the way through donation/ support (if you decide to) will make you proud - as you were part of the success - its a domino effect. My album has opened many doors for me and I wouldnt be as far along as I am now if I hadnt recorded the album. The same thing will happen with the music video - it will open doors for me as it is a powerful tool I can use to get my self as an artist and country rock/pop music noticed! I will never take your generosity for granted or ever forget it!</p><p> </p><h3> What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>I have already had numerous meetings with the people who are going to be involved in the shooting of the video. We have come to a ball park figure of $8000 NZD to shoot the video with the ideas I/we have in mind - to make it really exciting! There will be lots of 4 wheel drive trucks and utes involved as well as a fairly big cast including dancers &amp; 3 different shooting locations. I will need about $500 on top of this to release the single in Australia which includes distribution on i-tunes and record stores and trying to get my song onto the charts. This means I will need about $6500 USD.It is likely to cost me more than this at the end of they day - but I will top up as the 'top up' amount will be minimal compared to the overall cost. </p><div>
<p> </p>
<p>If I dont recieve the total sum through fundraising then (depending on my financial situation at the time) I will either top up the rest myself or put it into a holding account until i can afford to top it up and go ahead with the music video. Either way the music video WILL happen with the money I have made through fundraising - its just a matter of time. </p>

<h3><u>Our Story</u></h3>
<p></p>
<p>From New Plymouth, New Zealand, comes Darkwater, a 4 piece originals rock band, who formed late 2009.<br/></p>
<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 15px;""><p>Their first year together was spent developing their sound and style, which is gritty and gripping with a heaviness that enfolds melody.<br/></p>
<p>Darkwater have warmed themselves up by playing at various events such as the high profile G Taranaki Festival, and opening for bands such as I Am Giant, The Checks, An Emerald City and Decortica.<br/></p>
<p>Darkwater released their first demo EP mid 2010 which recieved promising reviews in the NZ Musician Magazine, with Darkwater being described as “dynamic alternative rock with strong songwriting, hooks and warm melodies”....""you won’t know whats hit you...”<br/></p>

<p>Keep an eye and an ear out for them.<br/></p></span><p></p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>The Impact</u></h3>
<p>Your investment will be helping us perfect our songs before final recording. It will mean that we can demo our new material, ourselves, without restricting &amp; costly studio time. It would cost at least $10,000 for us to demo these songs in a commercial studio where we would end up rushing to put out a final product. This way we can take our time &amp; really work on the songs to get them how we want them to sound!</p>

<h3><u>What We Need &amp; What You Get</u></h3>
<p>We've been building up our gear over the past 18 months but we still need some recording equipment. Specifically : 'PreSonus FireStudio 2626 FireWire Audio Interface'. We need this so we can record multitrack drum/guitar/vocal tracks for our demo. For the price of this unit we can record all of our own demos... for ever! It would cost the same for us to go into a professional recording studio for just 2 days. We have over 17 songs that need to be recorded &amp; we need your help to achive this.</p>

</p>
<p>Welcome to EZ Tiger’s fundraiser page for our upcoming EP! For those of you who aren’t
familiar with us here’s a bit of info: “EZ Tiger, female power trio from Los Angeles, CA, has
created a multi-layered, melodic and driving pop/rock sound led by singer/guitarist Tina
DiGeorge’s unconventional songwriting and richly captivating guitar stylings. Drummer and
backing vocalist, Kristy McInnis provides tight, inventive and explosive rhythms. Bass player and
background vocalist, Teresa Cowles brings a solid backbone with a keen pop sensibility. EZ
Tiger pulls off pulsing rockers as well as heart-crushing ballads with well-crafted skill and
finesse. The songs are uniquely infectious. Scott Bennett, Brian Wilson’s keyboardist and
collaborator, who has also worked with Liz Phair, Flaming Lips, to name a few, took quick notice
of the band’s talents, taking them under his wing and into the studio, producing an amazing
“self-titled” debut LP. Bennett’s creative contributions were invaluable, heightening the beauty
and raw power of EZ Tiger’s unique sound.”</p>
<p>We’re happy to be teaming up with Scott again to bring you this EP of brand new songs. Since
the release of our debut, we have been busy with live performances, writing loads of new
material, released two singles and have been thrilled to have garnered some great reviews and
praise. Here is a small sample of what people have been saying about the debut record and, in
general, about EZ Tiger:</p>
<p>""Everyone, it seems, loves the EZ Tiger sound, which lies somewhere near The Pixies or The
Breeders..."" <span>- Maria De La O, Curve Magazine </span></p>
<p>""The best song on the CD, Dancing for Dimes, has a menacing punk rhythm and a tasty guitar
outro by DiGeorge. It demonstrates that EZ Tiger can turn up the heat and channel the
Buzzcocks as convincingly as they can perform sweeter, more introspective material."" <span>- Jade Blackmore, The Slums Off Hollywood Boulevard </span></p>
<p>""EZ Tiger’s playful yet deliberately written songs are paradoxes: the tracks that are sweet and
lush at certain points, are raw and driving at others. The album bears a potent energy that pops
and soars... /// ...EZ Tiger seems to spin their own brand of wool that is delicately cultivated."" <span>- Jackie Lam, Radio Free Silverlake</span></p>
<p>""...EZ Tiger's music is more Clash than Sex Pistols, in fact it's not all the far from power pop,
albeit, with much rougher edges and more inventive arrangements. These songs have finesse
and are accessible...plenty melodic enough to work on soundtracks or get a few TV
placements.""</p>
<p>- Dean Moore, Music Connection</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“The self-titled debut album from EZ Tiger has everything one could want or expect from a rock
album: infectious rhythms, excellent vocals (and backing vocals), interesting and moving lyrics.
On top of it, this band has heart. This band doesn't hold back - in any area. They rock, but they
also don't shy away from pop grooves. Tina DiGeorge (the lead singer and guitarist) has both
power and vulnerability in her voice. </p>

<p>We are very excited about releasing a new body of work. This, of course, will take some
funding. Which, in the ever-changing climate of the art/music world, requires us to be creative
and reach out to as many supporters as possible. Any little bit towards our goal will help.
Anything above our goal will go towards promotion of the recording. Nothing will be wasted.
We believe strongly in supporting the arts in any way possible. Contributing to artists projects
directly is one of the best and most rewarding ways to do this. <span><span>Expenses for this EP include but aren’t limited to:</span></span></p>

outro by DiGeorge. It demonstrates that EZ Tiger can turn up the heat and channel the
Buzzcocks as convincingly as they can perform sweeter, more introspective material."" - Jade Blackmore, The Slums Off Hollywood Boulevard 
""EZ Tiger’s playful yet deliberately written songs are paradoxes: the tracks that are sweet and
lush at certain points, are raw and driving at others. The album bears a potent energy that pops
and soars... /// ...EZ Tiger seems to spin their own brand of wool that is delicately cultivated."" - Jackie Lam, Radio Free Silverlake
""...EZ Tiger's music is more Clash than Sex Pistols, in fact it's not all the far from power pop,
albeit, with much rougher edges and more inventive arrangements. These songs have finesse
and are accessible...plenty melodic enough to work on soundtracks or get a few TV
placements.""
- Dean Moore, Music Connection









“The self-titled debut album from EZ Tiger has everything one could want or expect from a rock
album: infectious rhythms, excellent vocals (and backing vocals), interesting and moving lyrics.
On top of it, this band has heart. This band doesn't hold back - in any area. They rock, but they
also don't shy away from pop grooves. Tina DiGeorge (the lead singer and guitarist) has both
power and vulnerability in her voice. 
- Michael Doherty, Suite 101.com















""...the tunes were well crafted /// these women put on a good show /// EZ Tiger's music is
incredibly enticing."" - Michele McManmon, LA Indie Music Examiner 









We are very excited about releasing a new body of work. This, of course, will take some
funding. Which, in the ever-changing climate of the art/music world, requires us to be creative
and reach out to as many supporters as possible. Any little bit towards our goal will help.
Anything above our goal will go towards promotion of the recording. Nothing will be wasted.
We believe strongly in supporting the arts in any way possible. Contributing to artists projects
directly is one of the best and most rewarding ways to do this. Expenses for this EP include but aren’t limited to:






- Studio Time
- Producer 
- Mastering 
- Pressing of physical CD’s 
- Promotion









PERKS:









We’ve put a lot of time into coming up with some perks as a “thank you” for your donations! Your donations will basically be a pre-order with some pretty exciting prizes!  Please have a look at them on the side of this page!  We thank you so much for your time and any contribution you can make! It is because of you
this record will be possible. 
Thanks, again!

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>Hi, I am Atiim Chenzira, and I have been writing songs since 1987, when I was 12 yo. Today I am reaching out to access support for funding my sophomore album, Aspects of Me, because I cannot afford to do it all alone. It has been 11years since I've released a body of work, but I've been recording with other musicians, have gone to graduate school to become a mental health therapist, and I have built up quite a reserve of songs that have never been released since 2001.</p>
<p>I have recently signed with a management company, Rio Vida (<a href=""http://www.riovida.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.riovida.net/</a>), and their distribution department wishes for me to have a product to them before the holidays (Nov. 10th, 2012). This financial campaign ends on December 10th, which will hopefully give me, and you, enough time to fully fund this amazing project. So, I have enlisted the support/help of quite a few amazing musicians and great artists to help me record, mix, master, and package my sophomore album, Aspect of Me. However, most of the work put forth in support is on deferment until I can raise the appropriate funds to pay for their time and efforts. Please consider funding my project, so that I may pay the talent that is working so hard at helping me achieve my goals and deadline. </p>
<p>This project is a compilation of many aspects of my expression. There is only one project missing from this album, my new band FatheR BrotheR Son. I will eventually share my newest project with everyone, and those that contribute in the $500 range will get to experience a live show of my newest project. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi there! I’m an indie musician based in Nashville and I need help finishing a swing song + music video. Way back in February I recorded a bunch of amazing footage of swing dancers dancing in the corner of Nashville Palace. My intention was to professionally produce the song and make a music video with the dance footage. </p>
<p>Since then, the world turned upside down, both globally and for me, personally. That’s where you come in. I need your help to finish this song + video! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I’ve teamed up with Eric Hevron-Smith and he is going to produce the song. Altogether it will cost $500. Eric is a talented producer, engineer and multi-instrumentalist. </p>
<ul>
<li>We need $500 to make this happen</li>
<li>All the funds go straight to Eric</li>
<li>If for some reason the amount goes over $500, I will invest that money into making my next record!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Making a fun music video right now may seem like a waste of time given the current state of the world, but I actually see it as the opposite: we need joy right now.

</div><p> </p></div>","Short Summary
Hi there! I’m an indie musician based in Nashville and I need help finishing a swing song + music video. Way back in February I recorded a bunch of amazing footage of swing dancers dancing in the corner of Nashville Palace. My intention was to professionally produce the song and make a music video with the dance footage. 
Since then, the world turned upside down, both globally and for me, personally. That’s where you come in. I need your help to finish this song + video! 

What We Need & What You Get
I’ve teamed up with Eric Hevron-Smith and he is going to produce the song. Altogether it will cost $500. Eric is a talented producer, engineer and multi-instrumentalist. 

We need $500 to make this happen
All the funds go straight to Eric
If for some reason the amount goes over $500, I will invest that money into making my next record!


The Impact
Making a fun music video right now may seem like a waste of time given the current state of the world, but I actually see it as the opposite: we need joy right now. This music video will bring a little light refreshment to the dark days of this year, like a drink of cold water. Song and dance are never not needed. In a time when the dance community is isolated and unable to partake in our favorite activity, I hope this video is a reminder of the joy that dance brings.

<p><strong>Total project cost     USD: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Time frame           January  - April 2013</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date submitted </strong></p>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION               </strong></p>
<p>Emmeth Young is a Belizean kriol drummer originally from Gale's Point, Manatee. He is considered to be one of  cultural ambassador of Kriol music,and the keeper of the African rhythms of his village and culture by extension. He is connected to the rhythmic traditions of his African ancestors since learning the traditional rhythms and dances of his unique village as a boy—the Sambai, the Kunjai, Bruk down, and Sadunga. He has been on a mission to share his culture through his music ever since, and this has taken him to all parts of Belize,  Mexico, and to the United States where he toured as part of a Belizean performance troupe in 1994.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Emmeth’s African identity is evident in the drums that he carves, and in the rhythms that he expresses with those instruments.  Since studying with West African master drummers during excursions to the United States between 1994 and 2001, Emmeth has been building West African Drums out of Belizean hardwood. Many tourists, and others visit his Drum school in his village where they learn to carve their drum and learn the rhythms so that they could take it with them.</p>
<p>Emmeth performs today in the Talla Walla Vibrations Band with his childhood friend, Randolph Andrewin, and several of the youth he has trained. The African rhythms and garb mixed with the infectious positive energy of his group has earned them national respect, including in Dangriga for the annual Garifuna Settlement Day celebration where they play every year. The Garinagu is the only other Afro-descendant group in Belize.</p>
<p>Emmeth is a member of the National Kriol Council, one of the two afro-descent groups in Belize.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>PROJECT PROPOSAL OVERVIEW </strong></p>
<p>Emmeth’s lifelong dream is to travel to West Africa to study music and dance, to reconnect with the traditions of his ancestors, and to bring knowledge back to Belize to share with youths and the public.  Through his network of drumming friends, Emmeth has a unique opportunity to embed himself and members of his group with professional musicians trained by one of the grand masters of West African traditional music—Famoudou Konate—in Guinea, West Africa.  They would be mentored by one of Famoudou’s protégé’s, Amadou Diakite, living in his home next to Famoudou’s family compound, and taking lessons with him and other world class musicians.  they will also have the opportunity to travel to remote villages to experience the music and dance in the  traditional contexts, to learn the deeper cultural significance of the art, and to receive mentorship in drum carving the African way.  This once in a lifetime opportunity is Emmeth’s and his group to seize if thy can make the long journey to Africa and sustain themselves once there.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This proposal is seeking  financial support to cover airfare, lodging, lessons in Guinea, and subsistence needs for four persons for a three month period starting in January 2013.  With this support, the group will reconnect with their culture, learn the rhythms and dances of the region, and expand their skills as carvers.  The output of this training will be for the group to return to Belize with a plan to impart their  knowledge to young people of the Afro-descent population and others countrywide. It is hoped that this will be another avenue of working with the afro-descendant population to teach them about their great heritage as well as an alternative to crime and violence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This proposal is requesting  that four persons be apart of this venture, Emmeth Young, Randolph Andrewin, Richard Cherrington and Denroy Castillo. If all four  cannot be funded then the request would be for the two master drummers, Emmeth Young and Randolf Andrewin</p>
<p><strong>  </strong></p>
<p><strong>Budget and justification</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The budget below reflects costs for Emmeth to travel alone, and the cost for each additional traveler should funding be allowed (up to three; Randolph, Richard, and Denroy).  Estimates were established with the assistance of Amadou’s former band mate, Abass Camara who now lives and works in the United States and is in direct contact with Amadou.  Abass’ family also lives in the neighborhood and two of his brothers speak English fluently and will help Emmeth and any travel companions with translations to French. </p>

INTRODUCTION               
Emmeth Young is a Belizean kriol drummer originally from Gale's Point, Manatee. He is considered to be one of  cultural ambassador of Kriol music,and the keeper of the African rhythms of his village and culture by extension. He is connected to the rhythmic traditions of his African ancestors since learning the traditional rhythms and dances of his unique village as a boy—the Sambai, the Kunjai, Bruk down, and Sadunga. He has been on a mission to share his culture through his music ever since, and this has taken him to all parts of Belize,  Mexico, and to the United States where he toured as part of a Belizean performance troupe in 1994.
 
Emmeth’s African identity is evident in the drums that he carves, and in the rhythms that he expresses with those instruments.  Since studying with West African master drummers during excursions to the United States between 1994 and 2001, Emmeth has been building West African Drums out of Belizean hardwood. Many tourists, and others visit his Drum school in his village where they learn to carve their drum and learn the rhythms so that they could take it with them.
Emmeth performs today in the Talla Walla Vibrations Band with his childhood friend, Randolph Andrewin, and several of the youth he has trained. The African rhythms and garb mixed with the infectious positive energy of his group has earned them national respect, including in Dangriga for the annual Garifuna Settlement Day celebration where they play every year. The Garinagu is the only other Afro-descendant group in Belize.
Emmeth is a member of the National Kriol Council, one of the two afro-descent groups in Belize.
 
PROJECT PROPOSAL OVERVIEW 
Emmeth’s lifelong dream is to travel to West Africa to study music and dance, to reconnect with the traditions of his ancestors, and to bring knowledge back to Belize to share with youths and the public.  Through his network of drumming friends, Emmeth has a unique opportunity to embed himself and members of his group with professional musicians trained by one of the grand masters of West African traditional music—Famoudou Konate—in Guinea, West Africa.  They would be mentored by one of Famoudou’s protégé’s, Amadou Diakite, living in his home next to Famoudou’s family compound, and taking lessons with him and other world class musicians.  they will also have the opportunity to travel to remote villages to experience the music and dance in the  traditional contexts, to learn the deeper cultural significance of the art, and to receive mentorship in drum carving the African way.  This once in a lifetime opportunity is Emmeth’s and his group to seize if thy can make the long journey to Africa and sustain themselves once there.
 
This proposal is seeking  financial support to cover airfare, lodging, lessons in Guinea, and subsistence needs for four persons for a three month period starting in January 2013.  With this support, the group will reconnect with their culture, learn the rhythms and dances of the region, and expand their skills as carvers.  The output of this training will be for the group to return to Belize with a plan to impart their  knowledge to young people of the Afro-descent population and others countrywide. It is hoped that this will be another avenue of working with the afro-descendant population to teach them about their great heritage as well as an alternative to crime and violence.
 
This proposal is requesting  that four persons be apart of this venture, Emmeth Young, Randolph Andrewin, Richard Cherrington and Denroy Castillo. If all four  cannot be funded then the request would be for the two master drummers, Emmeth Young and Randolf Andrewin
  
Budget and justification
 
The budget below reflects costs for Emmeth to travel alone, and the cost for each additional traveler should funding be allowed (up to three; Randolph, Richard, and Denroy).  Estimates were established with the assistance of Amadou’s former band mate, Abass Camara who now lives and works in the United States and is in direct contact with Amadou.  Abass’ family also lives in the neighborhood and two of his brothers speak English fluently and will help Emmeth and any travel companions with translations to French.

The single largest budget item is a fee that includes modern lodging in Simbaya (including running water and bathrooms) and instruction from Amadou and his fellow musicians.  The fee for instruction covers immersion into the world of Guinean professional musicians, including daily lessons in music and technique.  This fee is lowered for additional travelers because lodging would be covered already.  The second largest line item is the fee for international travel to Guinea from Belize.  This fee is the same for each traveler.  The third largest line item is for incidentals, which include in-country transportation to and from the city and the villages, purified water, snacks, medicine, and spending cash.   Meals and a 90-day visa are about US$3/day and $100 respectively.

<i>Suénalo ""Keep It Groovin'""</i> Album Release <br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>SUÉNALO (sweh-na-low) v. - Latin funk. 
Fusion. Jam band. Multicultural cocktail. The sound of Miami. 
Afro-Latin-Baby-Makin’-Descarga-Funk. They’re all names that we have 
used to describe Suénalo, and they’re all 
on the money. . . to a point. Because somehow, even the lengthy, hyphenated 
description we came up with to describe our hard-to-pin-down style falls short of the true breadth of what we 
represent. If
 Suenalo's one-of-a-kind fusion is hard to pinpoint, it’s only because 
no one’s ever done anything quite like it before.  <br/></p>
<p><b>The fans have spoken and now after more than four years, Suénalo has answered with the release of <i>Keep it Groovin</i>'. On this 4th studio album, we have worked our butts off and spent countless hours touring, writing and rehearsing. </b><br/></p>
<p> The Boston Globe said it best -
                ""<i>...dancing, twisting, shouting -- press toward the 10-piece band and a barrage of music that's simultaneously Afro-Cuban, hip-hop, R&amp;B, Latin, funk, and unmistakably Miami."" 2/11/07</i></p>
<p>This is the result of a 12-year process of compromise and of growth between
 some of South Florida’s most talented musicians, who come together and 
share an ideal: that music should move their audience. Suenalo’s roster 
is stacked with nine full-time members boasting chops to rival anyone, 
anywhere. <br/></p>
<p>Our lineup is a who’s-who of brilliant musicians who have 
not only made their immovable imprint on Miami’s local music scene, but 
well beyond. </p>

<p><strong>INTRODUCING ME</strong></p>
<p><br/> Hi, my name is Niv Kaikov and I'm a singer/songwriter. I’m originally from Israel but am now currently based in New York.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, I had very scary accident which led to a long 9 months of recovery and  soul-searching. During that time, I had an epiphany. I realized that I had been living half a life, where I was moderately successful but wasn't truly happy. So I decided it was time to embark on a new journey and pursue my real passion in life, MUSIC, and thus began the “Road Trip” of my life.</p>
<p>Now, I've teamed up with an awesome group of students at the New York Film Academy to shoot and release my new song, Road Trip, but we need your help! So please join the NK Team and show your support by donating and sharing this page!</p>

<p>Over the last year, I've been performing around New York City and recording new songs in my home studio. Now it’s time for me to share my music with the rest of the world. I’ve already professionally recorded my first single “Road Trip”, but there’s still a lot to be done. I need to have the song mixed and mastered in a professional studio plus shoot the music video so I’m going to need your help. Therefore I'm inviting you all to take an active part in my journey!

<h3>Ok so here's the deal:</h3>
<div>Crooked Bangs is about to embark on another tour, this time to the west coast! Everything is set in stone and the shows have all been booked by our guitarist Samantha as well as contributing resources by Leda and I (Phillip). This process takes a lot of work and has been in the works for a long long time now. </div>
<div><b>The Problem?</b></div>
<div>As our departure date nears we have run into a couple of problems... We bought a van that has some issues that might put the tour in jeopardy. What we thought were minor issues turned out to be worse than we expected. This was not planned and the last thing we ever wanted to do is ask for handouts to fix our van... Unfortunately were getting desperate as time nears. </div>
<div><b>Why?</b></div>
<div>It's hard to get people on board with personal project, we understand, everyone is busy these days and money is not exactly something we can just toss around... But we are extremely passionate and work extremely hard at what we do, and were in it to win it. We are not asking you to fund our vacation, thats far from what tour is like. We just need a little boost to get us and keep us on the road, and safe. This industry is incredibly hard and it takes harder work to get anywhere, which is why we practice relentlessly and play as many shows as we can. We value artistic creativity and the bold who pursue goals that few people have the will to go for their dreams. </div>
<div><b>Anyways, </b></div>
<div>Anything helps and we value everyone who takes the time even to read this, if you cannot contribute directly, do it by spreading the word for us. We have come a long way in a very short amount of time and we do not plan on stopping. Hopefully some of you can find value in the Perks we are offering contributors. If you have read to this point, we love you and look forward to shipping you fun stuff we have put together!</div>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>A Careless Skyline has been offered a HUGE opportunity to go on tour with another big act! It has always been our dream to tour and get our music out there to other parts of the country. Music is our passion, and we are so excited about this chance. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here is what we need your help for:</p>
<p>We are all working guys and are taking the time off to live our dream. However, as you all know, touring can be expensive and we just don't have the funds to pay for everything on the road. The money we are raising is for gas, motels, and any possible things that could happen on the road. None of your money is going to our personal needs of food or souvenirs or anything like that. And don't think you wont be rewarded. We have some awesome things we are giving away for your contributions. :)</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Anyone close to music or us, knows that getting out there is a huge way to spread your music. We have some shows on this tour that could gain us HUGE exposure to record labels and agents. We would love to pay for everything on our own, but sadly we cant. We just need a little boost from you guys. And hey, if we make it big, you all know you will be rewarded with A LOT, because we believe that our fans and friends are what make it all happen and make us successful!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know times are tough and maybe not everyone can help out. But, we know our friends still love us and will help out. Some ways you can are:</p>
<p>Spread the word about our campaign! Facebook it, text it, tweet it, or shout it from a mountain top. Whatever floats your boat. </p></span></div>","Short Summary

<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">The story:</strong></p>
<p>So after our incredible last tour this past December, our transmission basically checked out of existence. We limped home at an incredible 30 MPH after returning our borrowed trailer a week after the tour ended. While the time and place were fortunate for this occurance, our bank account wasn't so lucky. We simply just don't have enough funds to repair the Allegaeonmobile.  We have this incredible tour coming up and literally no way of going out and rocking for you guys.  While the repairs are estimated in the quad digits, and as if this wasn't going to be hard enough, our lovely trailer we were borrowing was sold. Add ""need a trailer"" to our problems and here we are coming to you, our friends, to help us out. Normally we'd just push our merch store really hard to try and raise the funds, however, we simply do not have enough merch left to help us out with this high a bill. So it really comes down to this: if you don't like these fundraising things (and believe me, it was a highly debated topic within the band), then please go with your conscience and rock on! If you wanna see us come to your town, (and even if that is not this tour then stay tuned) it'd be unbelievably humbling if you can help us out.</p>
<p>We've had a really hard time trying to get tours and this is a great opportunity that we simply don't want to miss. We want to grow and be around to bring you Allegaeon music for years to come, so thanks for taking the time to read this and check out our page. Hopefully we'll see your beautiful face in the near future so we can melt it off!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>E.P. reprint:</h3>
<p>If we do surpass our goal, we will reprint hard copies of the E.P. (recorded in 2008). We know a lot of you have mentioned this and we hope this comes to pass. If it does, we will be sending these to those who donate at the 20 dollar level and above. You guys rock!</p>
<p>MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEETTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!</p>

She too deserves fair compensation for her amazing work on my promotional video and photos.    I'll also be taking a lot of time off of working my customer service jobs to focus on making the record, including several long drives, so there will be significant expenses there as well. Breakdown
Tracking, Producing, Mastering: $1,800
Guest musicians: $800
Manufacturing CDs, liner notes, packaging, etc.: $1,300
Promotional photos, video, posters, etc.: $520
Fees, Gas, food, shipping, perks, indiegogo cut: $960
For a grand total of $5,380!If I reach my goal, I only lose %4 to Indiegogo and keep the rest! If 200 people donate just $27, we can do it! But remember, even if I don't reach my total goal I'll still receive however much I do raise (minus a %9 cut for Indiegogo). So, even if I only raise $2000, I can still begin production! In return for your support you'll get lots of goodies. Think of your contribution as an investment rather than a donation. Check out all the sweet perks on the right! (Note: all perks except personal shout outs will be awarded after the album is finished. Estimated delivery by July 2014.) Why?I am an independent musician. That means that without the help of a manager, agent, record label, or Ryan Seacrest, in order for what I’m doing to be sustainable I need to rely directly on the support of my listeners. YOU. I’m not searching for fame or fortune, but I do have a Song in my heart that needs to be sung. You can help me sing it, and maybe pierce a few hardened hearts and tear down a few walls of isolation and oppression. Other Ways You Can HelpSome people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:
Be my street team! Do some grassroots promotion for me among your friends.

Spread the word via email and social media. Use the indiegogo sharing tools!

Bhajan is a type of Hindu devotional music going back many centuries. It can be

very intense ragas. For my Bhajan recording I will site some very major poets
from the Bhakti movement era (800-1700) such as Surdas, Tulsi Das and Sant
Kabir.<br/><br/>
Baithak Gana is a form of music originating in Trinidad, Guyana and Suriname by the Hindustani community. It is a mix of Bhojpuri folk songs with
other Caribbean influences. This contemporary fusion of genres was created by
the Indo-Caribbean people whose ancestors were from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh,
Bengal and South India area around Madras. The Baithak Gana recording I’m
planning to release is a collection of traditional Baithak Gana songs from
Trinidad, Guyana and Suriname going as far back as 1833 from when indentured
servants arrived in the Caribbean with lyrics depicting scenes of various text such
as Ramayan, Bhagavad Gita, Mahabharat, Krishna Leela and Ram Leela.</p>

<h3>Mike Marshall: Full-Length Album Project</h3>
<p>Mike Marshall is a singer/songwriter based out of Columbus, Georgia.  He has a passion for humanity to experience the love and healing of God through music.</p>
<p>His first EP, New Grace, released in January of 2021 with three singles:  JESUS, New Grace, and Satisfy.</p>
<p>For Mike’s next project, the Lord impressed on him the theme of healing - physical, mental, and emotional - especially coming out of the year 2020.  He wanted this music to allow people to have a personal, real, healing encounter with God. One verse that is an anchor in his writing and planning process is 1 Samuel 16:23,""Whenever the spirit from God came on Saul, David would take up his lyre and play. Then relief would come to Saul; he would feel better, and the evil spirit would leave him.""  This verse is a reminder of the power that music has to bring about real life healing, deliverance, breakthrough, peace...you name it!</p>
<p>In considering the scope of this endeavor, Mike knew he couldn’t do it alone.  He would need prayer and support - it truly will take a village!  Specifically, he needs your prayers - over the songwriting process, the music, and the release.  If you feel led, you can support this project financially through this site. Mike is an independent artist, not currently signed with a label, so your investment in the music has a very real impact. Your contributions will bring this album to life.     </p>
<p>The production process will begin this summer and the live album recording will take place in mid-September, with an anticipated album release date of early 2022.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>A Message from Mike:</h3>
<p><i>“Since the release of my first EP, I have been encouraged to hear how many of you are experiencing Jesus through the music and lyrics. Your stories have truly inspired much of my writing for this new album.  I cannot wait to share the songs and messages of healing and hope that have come from this season. I believe this project will be right on time for many of you. Thank you for your prayers and support - I am grateful and honored.” -Mike Marshall</i></p>

<p>My name is David Floyd and I am with a new metal act out of Lansing, MI called DeverauX. We have only been established for a short amount of time but are gaining ground very quickly. After winning Lansing's ""Q106 Homegrown Throwdown"" we were able to record a 5 track E.P. entitled ""The Last of Us"", but have come up short on the funds for duplication. This is where all of you come in.</p>
<p>This is your (the fans) chance to contribute to our cause. We would like to use this as our way of letting you <em>pre-order</em> your copy of ""The Last of Us"", now. <strong>Every person that pays in advance will be in fact making this CD possible.</strong></p>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need <strong>$1500</strong> to publish our CD. This is what we need it for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$1400</strong> is needed for the pressing and duplication through Disk Makers.</li>
<li>
<strong>$100</strong> is needed for the surcharge through this site.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if we don't reach this goal we will still seek other forms of funding and release this E.P. without a doubt. <strong>Evey contribution helps greatly.</strong></p>
<p>We are only pressing <strong>1000</strong> CD's and selling them for <strong>$5</strong>, so if you order now you will <strong>guarantee</strong> yourself a copy.</p>
<p>Here are your options for contribution:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$5</strong>   - <em>Pre-Order</em> CD (<em>Guaranteed</em>)</li>
<li>
