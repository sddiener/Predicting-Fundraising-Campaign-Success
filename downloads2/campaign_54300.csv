<p>My name is Lucia Echevarria. I study Administration at USIL University.  I am in the last semester.I'm quite interested in volunteering helping people to improve human quality of life, I also belive that entrepreneurship and social responsibility will contibuite to achieve this goal.</p>
<p> last year I had the idea of make my own entrepreneurship, which consisted in create a food store to sell  native products from different regions of my country. I was looking for revaluate our products and revaluate the work of small and medium-sized farmers, as well as to improve people nutrition.</p>
<p>When I finished my business plan, I realized that in order to put the store into operation, it would require a lot of investment, which I didn't have. That is why I decided to bring one product for the Andes to sell in Lima City. That product was the “imilla potato” that is a variety of Peruvian native potato that grows in Puno, 3800 meters above sea level. They are sown and harvested without chemicals or pesticides.</p>
<p>The potato sale was a success, selling 100 kilos in two days. The persons in Lima had never tried that variety of potato.

</div></div>","My name is Lucia Echevarria. I study Administration at USIL University.  I am in the last semester.I'm quite interested in volunteering helping people to improve human quality of life, I also belive that entrepreneurship and social responsibility will contibuite to achieve this goal.
 last year I had the idea of make my own entrepreneurship, which consisted in create a food store to sell  native products from different regions of my country. I was looking for revaluate our products and revaluate the work of small and medium-sized farmers, as well as to improve people nutrition.
When I finished my business plan, I realized that in order to put the store into operation, it would require a lot of investment, which I didn't have. That is why I decided to bring one product for the Andes to sell in Lima City. That product was the “imilla potato” that is a variety of Peruvian native potato that grows in Puno, 3800 meters above sea level. They are sown and harvested without chemicals or pesticides.
The potato sale was a success, selling 100 kilos in two days. The persons in Lima had never tried that variety of potato. In Peru we have more than 3000 varieties of potatoes but in Lima we only eat 4 or 5 types of potaoes.  Which motivated me to continue bringing new products. However, I don't have the money to bring more
Actually I take the order through whatssapp and I deliver potatoes by moto delivery. I use special bags made of jute (as seen in the photo). Also  I take take care of the environment. I have 40 clients that buy these delicious potatoes every month. My dream is to increase the quantity of products, until I can set up our own store. I know I have a long way, so I go step by step.

The Impact
Puno is in southeasterm Peru between the shore of Lake Titicaca and Andes Mountains. Also Puno is the fisrt major hub in the constant migration of indigenous people of the Andes to the larger cities of Peru. Most of them come from agricultural communities seeking better opportunities for education and employment.

The impact of this Project is to make known the imilla potato and other different types of peruvian native products.
I Also seek to be a intermediary between small farmers and the people looking to consume organic foods. So they can access to Lima market and increase the sell of their agricultural products.

What we need?
Thanks to your collaboration, we will be able to achieve some of our goals this year as:

Bring two new native products from Puno such as ""multicolored quinoa"" (Andean grain) and yacon (fruit)
Increase the amount of Kilos from 100 to 200.
Attend more customers by delivery, today we serve 40
Distribute the products every 15 days, today is once a month.

What you get?
Each person will get a personal thanks (Virtual High Five). Every support counts and I will be grateful! Also I will greeting when update facebook page.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>On November 11th 2018, we launched <a href=""http://tippsysake.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tippsy Sake</a>, the largest online sake platform in the US.</p>
<p>My name is Genki. I moved to the US in 2009 and have been working for the largest Japanese Food/Sake importer in the US. Having seen the gap between the growing interest in craft sake and the lack of availability in selection and knowledge for majority of consumers, I founded Tippsy to take the initiatives to promote this Japanese ""mystery drink"" and expand the potential to make it a whole new alcohol category like wine. </p>
<p><a href=""https://tippsysake.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://tippsysake.com/</a></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Crowdfunding Campaign?</h3>
<p>We want to expand our business to offer a monthly subscription service that will feature three small bottles so curious drinkers can explore new flavors and food pairings to find the brand they truly love! We need at least 100 subscribers to secure inventory and prepare operations.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542100517/jgz39wkwzmlcw2aj1mn7.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why we do what we do</h3>
<p>Although many people have tried sake at sushi restaurants, high-quality sakes don’t usually reach consumers due to the buyer’s lack of knowledge, strict regulations in alcohol distribution, and the complex supply chain that involves a lot of middle margins. In fact, many of the products that actually reach restaurants or retail stores are cheaper, mass-produced items made in California with US-made rice. </p>
<p>Sake has gained a lot of interest, but the jargon can be intimidating. Without a fair amount of knowledge, most consumers find it difficult to choose a bottle that fits their taste preferences and end up missing out on the versatile flavors of authentic, premium sake that matches all types of cuisine other than just sushi. </p>

</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Simplifying the Experience</h3>
<p>We’ve decoded the labels and created taste metrics for almost 200 sake so you can easily try new flavors and food pairings to enhance your dining experience! With our unique and easy-to-understand visual metrics, we’re taking the guesswork out of selecting sake so that you’ll know what you’re drinking and can easily pair it with your favorite dishes. </p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Streamlining the Supply Chain</h3>
<p>Our operations will be based in California where most of the ocean containers carrying sake first arrive to the US. We’re cutting out the middlemen to keep the supply chain as short and simple as possible so that you can enjoy sake fresher than you would normally drink, and at reasonable prices. (less than half of what you’d normally pay at restaurants)</p>

<h3>Use of Funds</h3>

</div></div>","Short Summary
On November 11th 2018, we launched Tippsy Sake, the largest online sake platform in the US.
My name is Genki. I moved to the US in 2009 and have been working for the largest Japanese Food/Sake importer in the US. Having seen the gap between the growing interest in craft sake and the lack of availability in selection and knowledge for majority of consumers, I founded Tippsy to take the initiatives to promote this Japanese ""mystery drink"" and expand the potential to make it a whole new alcohol category like wine. 
https://tippsysake.com/

Why Crowdfunding Campaign?
We want to expand our business to offer a monthly subscription service that will feature three small bottles so curious drinkers can explore new flavors and food pairings to find the brand they truly love! We need at least 100 subscribers to secure inventory and prepare operations.

Why we do what we do
Although many people have tried sake at sushi restaurants, high-quality sakes don’t usually reach consumers due to the buyer’s lack of knowledge, strict regulations in alcohol distribution, and the complex supply chain that involves a lot of middle margins. In fact, many of the products that actually reach restaurants or retail stores are cheaper, mass-produced items made in California with US-made rice. 
Sake has gained a lot of interest, but the jargon can be intimidating. Without a fair amount of knowledge, most consumers find it difficult to choose a bottle that fits their taste preferences and end up missing out on the versatile flavors of authentic, premium sake that matches all types of cuisine other than just sushi. 


 
Simplifying the Experience
We’ve decoded the labels and created taste metrics for almost 200 sake so you can easily try new flavors and food pairings to enhance your dining experience! With our unique and easy-to-understand visual metrics, we’re taking the guesswork out of selecting sake so that you’ll know what you’re drinking and can easily pair it with your favorite dishes. 

 
Streamlining the Supply Chain
Our operations will be based in California where most of the ocean containers carrying sake first arrive to the US. We’re cutting out the middlemen to keep the supply chain as short and simple as possible so that you can enjoy sake fresher than you would normally drink, and at reasonable prices. (less than half of what you’d normally pay at restaurants)

Use of Funds
We will use the fund mainly to prepare for monthly subscription box. Although we set the goal of the project to $5K to just cover base costs, we will need approximately $10K to establish smooth operations because we are just starting up.
$2000 for inventory - It takes approximately 3 months to receive shipments from Japan. This portion of funds will be used to secure inventory for the confirmed number of club members to get our service off the ground.
$5000 for Shipping Materials ( box, inserts, cutting dies and print plate) - We’ve perfected our custom-made packaging to ensure maximum durability of glass sake bottles for nationwide delivery. Upfront investment will be required to secure these shipping materials.
$3000 for Warehouse Space - We’re currently subleasing a corner of a small warehouse. A larger space is necessary for more efficient operations and the shortest turnaround for our orders.

<p>In addition to providing vitamins and key electrolytes, Jele tabs also reduce the impact plastic is having on our lives. The carbon footprint of the plastic bottles from the big sports drink brands is enormous. In addition to the raw materials and energy used to make the bottles, a huge impact is made with the transport of the bottles from their source, to the bottling facility, to the stores where you buy them and finally, to your home. Only 25% of all the plastic in the US is recycled, so most of those plastic bottles end up in landfills, with some even making their way to our oceans. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>A product like Jele, formulated for kids, is long overdue. Kids are getting too much sugar and sodium in their diets already, so we believe they shouldn't get overloaded with even more in the sports drinks they consume. Parents want their kids to drink more water, but it's tough because kids' taste buds have become conditioned to like salty, sugary foods and drinks. As kids grow into adulthood, their metabolism slows and they exercise less, but they are left with the same taste for salty, sugary foods. A lack of exercise and an unhealthy diet in adulthood can lead to a whole host of medical issues like high blood pressure, heart disease and even Type 2 Diabetes. </p>
<p>During development, people asked ""Why don't you just make a drink out of it so you don't have to use the tablet?"" The answer was always the same - the tablet is part of the solution! What's easier - giving your kid a tube of 10 tablets to throw in their backpack or sports bag for use whenever they need it, or trying to remember ""Did I put a drink in their bag today?"" </p>
<p>And finally, we have this plastic problem. Only 25% of the plastic in the US gets recycled, despite our concerted efforts of recycling at home. Some countries that used to accept plastic waste from the US (presumably headed to recycling facilities, but who really knows) are not accepting our plastic waste anymore, so a lot of it is heading to our landfills. The easiest way to ease our recycling burden is to manufacture and use less stuff in the first place.</p>
<p>Our goal at Jele is to empower our kids to take control of their health at an early age. To learn about what they are putting in their bodies and not get addicted to salty, sugary foods and drinks so they can avoid chronic health problems in the future. We hope you'll support us in this effort and help us bring Jele to as many kids as we can possibly reach. </p>

<h3>Salut, </h3>

<p>We are Midnight Poutine! For those who never heard of us, we're a Burning Man food camp from the french speaking province of Canada called Québec.  Since 2009, we've been driving 10 000 km (6 200 miles) to Black Rock City, NV, to serve poutines to very hungry and eager burners at -surprise - midnight!</p>
<p>But what's poutine?  It's a traditional Québecois comfort food usually (but not always) eaten after a night of drinking. It’s made from french fries and cheese curds (what is called in Quebecois ""cheese droppings ""). The whole thing covered with thick brown sauce from ancient family recipes.  After a full day of drinking and partying on the playa this simple dish will blow you away!</p>
<p>Last year, 2000 hungry burners got a taste of Midnight Poutine. It's a party every night with Québecois music, a burn barrel, sexy people, line-ups around the block, an open-mic and burlesque stage to entertain the line-up and, of course, poutine! We don't want to leave anybody hungry at BRC :)  </p>
<p>We need your contributions for :</p>
<p>Cheese curds : Hell yeah, we use REAL cheese curds!  Without cheese we would just have fries and sauce, and we all know how boring that would be.  And it turns out that cheese curds are our biggest expense!!!</p>
<p>The other Ingredients : This include potatoes, gravy,  and oil and there's a lot propane to feed our trusty 6 fryers.</p>
<p>The other Logistics : It takes a lot to set up a food camp, make eating areas, an open-mic stage and decorations, not to mention getting all this stuff to Burning Man from Montreal and renting a storage locker year-round in Reno, NV, for all our other stuff.  'nuff said.  </p>
<p>It cost about 5000$ to serve about 2000 poutines and this excludes our camp's expenses. Some of the financing is done through fundraising events and by us. So that means ALL the money you contribute goes toward running the poutine kitchen! The more money we get, the more poutines we have the pleasure to serve, it's that simple.</p>
<p>Please help us feed our fellow burners in 2019 by funding the best late-night party food camp on the playa.  Thank you all!</p>
<p>*** UPDATE *** (Aug. 1st)</p>
<p>Thanks to you all we have reached our funding goal! Woo-hoo!! But there are still 5 days left, so if we can reach $4000 USD (our new extended goal), we shall be able to offer you poutine with BACON and cold draft BEER on the playa!! Isn't that awesome?  :-)</p>

<p>Bonjour à tous,</p>
<p>Nous sommes Midnight Poutine,  un camp de Montréal qui depuis 2009 parcourt 10 000 km aller-retour pour se rendre a Burning Man au Nevada. Tous les soirs à minuit sur la ""playa"", nous offrons de la poutine à nos compatriotes festivaliers (ou ""burners"").</p>
<p>Qu’est-ce que la poutine? Il s’agit d’un plat typiquement québécois composé de patates frites et de fromage en grain, communément appelé ""crottes de fromage"", le tout nappé d’une sauce dont la recette est un secret familial bien gardé.  Après une journée complète de fête et de boisson, le goût de nos poutines va faire littéralement ""capoter"" tous les burners.</p>
<p>L’an passé, nous avons offert 2000 poutines à des burners affamés qui étaient prêt à attendre des heures pour goûter à notre petit plat typique de fin-de-brosse.  Ça devient une fête improvisée a tous les soirs avec de la grosse musique Québécoise, du beau monde sexy, un baril de feu, une immense file d'attente, une scène ouverte ou les gens peuvent monter et divertir ceux qui attendent en ligne avec des performances de musique, burlesque, etc. et, bien sûr, d'la poutiiiiiiiine!</p>
<p>Nous avons besoin de vos contributions pour : </p>
<p>Les crottes de fromage : Eh oui, le fromage est sans contredit notre dépense la plus coûteuse mais sans fromage ça ne serait qu’une frite-sauce et on sait bien que c’est plate une frite-sauce.</p>
<p>Les autres ingrédients : Cela inclut les patates, la sauce, l’huile et aussi le gaz propane pour alimenter nos 6 friteuses adorées.</p>
<p>Les autres logistiques : À chaque année, nous devons construire notre camp, nos deux cuisines (publique et privée),  la scène ""open-mic and burlesque stage"" sans compter le transport de notre matériel en camion à partir de Montréal jusqu’à la playa et la location à l'année d'un espace d'entreposage pour le reste de notre stock à Reno, NV. Soyez certains que tout l'argent ramassé servira uniquement aux besoins culinaires de Midnight Poutine.</p>Il nous en coûte environ 5000$ pour servir 2000 poutines et ceci exclut les dépenses de notre campement. Une bonne partie de notre financement est faite grâce à des événements locaux en plus de nos propres contributions. Ainsi, TOUTES les sommes que nous collecterons dans cette campagne serviront uniquement à financer la cuisine.  Plus nous amasserons d'argent, plus de poutines nous aurons le plaisir de servir sur la playa. C'est aussi simple que ça.<br/> <p>Nous vous remercions de bien vouloir nous aider à répéter l’expérience encore une fois cette année. C'est grâce à vous que Midnight Poutine devient un lieu incontournable pour commencer sa soirée à Burning Man 2019. Un gros merci à tous!! </p>
<p>*** MISE-À-JOUR *** (1ier Aout)</p>
<p>Grâce à vous nous avons atteint notre objectif de financement! Hoorah!! Mais il reste encore 5 jours à notre campagne, donc si on peut atteindre $4000 USD (notre nouvel objectif), nous serons en mesure de vous offrir de la poutine avec BACON et de la BIÈRE en fût sur la playa!! C'est-tu pas cool ça?  :-)</p>

C'est aussi simple que ça. Nous vous remercions de bien vouloir nous aider à répéter l’expérience encore une fois cette année. C'est grâce à vous que Midnight Poutine devient un lieu incontournable pour commencer sa soirée à Burning Man 2019. Un gros merci à tous!! 
*** MISE-À-JOUR *** (1ier Aout)
Grâce à vous nous avons atteint notre objectif de financement! Hoorah!! Mais il reste encore 5 jours à notre campagne, donc si on peut atteindre $4000 USD (notre nouvel objectif), nous serons en mesure de vous offrir de la poutine avec BACON et de la BIÈRE en fût sur la playa!! C'est-tu pas cool ça?  :-)",1.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<h2>Our Story &amp; Mission </h2>
<p>Bare Bones Coffee is a two person team of Mina Cahue and Frankie Adriano. We, like many other coffee professionals, ended up in this industry by accident. We picked up jobs as baristas on a whim and we've been obsessed with coffee ever since. We fell in love with the creative outlet that coffee provided us and the environment of cafes, but we always wanted something more. We wanted to keep challenging ourselves and the people that worked with us. We knew the only way we could be content is if we created something that was entirely our own.</p>
<p>We established Bare Bones Coffee because we wanted to challenge the norms of how coffee can and should be served. We believe in keeping things simple, approachable, intentional, and graceful. Every movement and interaction should have a meaning behind it. </p>
</div><div>
<p>We chose the name Bare Bones Coffee because it reflects our minimalist and earnest approach to our business. We will be operating as a bare-bones cafe as we carry around our compact espresso bar from place to place; we will also be featuring a slimmed down espresso based menu, Mexican and Asian inspired pastries, and a service style focused around being welcoming and hospitable. We hope you enjoy our coffee as much as we enjoy serving it.</p>
<h2>Funding</h2>
<p>All the funding for this campaign will be used for various things that we need to become operational. We're about 90% ready to get rolling and start serving the public, but we need a little bit more to get ourselves properly established.  These funds will go towards a countertop pitcher rinser, a plumb-in kit for our espresso machine, and a POS system. Any left over funds will be used for various operational costs (e.g. ingredients, disposables, etc).</p>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>Feel free to post the link to our campaign and tell people you know about us. We'll be doing pop-ups in the downtown La Grange area so if you know anyone around there, let them know about our project! But the biggest favor you can do for us is when we pop up, come in and visit us for a cup of coffee and a chat so you can see what we're about in person.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">-----------------------------</p>
<p>P.S. A huge thank you to everyone that has supported us, encouraged us, and advised us so far. Bare Bones Coffee wouldn't be possible without everyone's help. This company is as much an effort of yours as it is ours, and for that we are immensely grateful. </p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by our little page!</p>
<p>I'm Jim Bozic, and I'm hoping to be the proud owner of Rocky and Shem's Ice Cream Shoppe. My pups, Rocky and Shem, are the inspiration for all of this.</p>
<p>What we want to bring is a people and puppy friendly ice cream shop to South Minneapolis. Your generous donations will be going toward the cost of the additional equipment so we can provide our four-legged neighborhood friends with delicious homemade treats that they so desperately deserve.</p>
<p>We are looking at raising $10,000 to help cover the puppy aspect of our business. The cost of the refrigeration equipment is about $7,000 (includes the storage and displays for the puppy treats), and the outdoor kennel area which will run about $3,000. The outdoor kennel area is important for us as we want to provide a safe, inviting location for families to bring their puppies. And if we don't raise the entire amount, we will still be applying the money to the puppy portion of our business. It'll just take us longer to get there. But that will make the puppies sad. And nobody likes sad doggies, right?!</p>
<p>In return for your support, we want you to know that you will physically be a part of Rocky and Shem's. For every donation we receive, your name will be will be permanently painted in a border around our shop and given many thanks on our website. We want you to know that without you, we couldn't make this happen, and what better way than to etch you in as part of the Rocky and Shem Experience!</p>
<p>For those that our able to give more, we will also shower you with free ice cream and clothing, too. And for those that can give the most, we will dedicate an ice cream special in honor of your name! We will also post it online for all to see!</p>
<p>We plan to open the doors in April of 2013. We will be able to send out the perks starting in the middle of August.</p>
<p>So on to the other stuffs…</p>
<p>You might be saying to yourself, ""well, that's great for pups, but what about for me?"". And I have an answer! We will be bringing Bridgeman's Ice Cream back to South Minneapolis. See, our community is lacking a certain flair. There isn't really a neighborhood friendly place that people can sit and enjoy themselves. And that's what we want to do. Think of it as us giving back to the community!</p>
<p>So, there you have it in a nutshell! And if you don't have the means to help us meet our goal, you can still help us out. So, spread the word, like us on facebook, have a parade in our honor, share us on Indiegogo. But most importantly, just wish us luck on our tremendous journey!</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and support!<br/>-Jim, Deb, Rocky, and Shem</p>

<p>*The free scoop perk is limited to in-store, once a week. This can also be transferrable to your favorite pooch!  :)</p>

Creating beers for the gatherings, holidays,<br/>friends. Then brewing for the SBAC Golf Outing, Pitchfest,Edgewater Chamber<br/>of Commerce Holiday Party, and many special nights for the Factory Theater.<br/>From home to outings to a new home for outings, this is the story of<br/>Chuck Patella and Howard Street Brewing Company.</div>
<hr/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540131411/vmd0rlkp6ijkraca8rdq.png"" src=""""/>
</div> <div>While sitting on a bar stool at the Rock Bottom Brewery in Chicago, IL, my buddy turned to me and said that he just started homebrewing. I had no idea what that meant, but I wanted to know more. We talked a lot about the intricacies of beer.  We talked about the process.  We talked about flavor profile.  We talked about all the different breweries in Chicago and Michigan.  I was infatuated with the process and the culture.  After I walked out of the bar that night, all I wanted to do was make beer. I dedicated myself to the study of beer: I visited breweries, listened intently to brewers when they spoke about their craft, read all the books I could find, and finally started creating recipes. After 10 years of brewing, events, and valuable feedback, I am finally ready to take beer making to the next level. I am opening a 1 Barrel tap room, Howard Street Brewing Company, on the northern edge of Rogers Park.</div>
<div> </div>
<div style=""font-size: 20px;font-weight: bold;"">The First Beer:</div>The first beer I ever made was an Irish Red Ale. It was a malt extract kit that came with dry yeast. It’s easily the worst beer I have ever made. To my credit, I've always taken sanitation seriously, so I don't think there was a bacterial infection. What it lacked in flavor, which was everything, it made up for in cleanliness. I had made very sanitary beer-flavored water. When the bottles started exploding in my closet from over carbonation, I realized I had some things to think about.<br/> <div style=""font-size: 20px;font-weight: bold;"">Current Beers:</div>

<div style=""display: inline;float: left;width: 385px;margin-left:5px;"">I've come a long way since my almost breakup from my then-girlfriend-now-loving-wife. When we both woke up screaming due to the sound of an exploding bottle (as I mention in the video, she is truly a saint), I wasn’t sure how much further she would go. Lucky for me, we just celebrated our 10-year wedding anniversary! Things are much safer now, both for the marriage and the bottles. I regularly brew my own all-grain recipes and kegging at home. I have taken over a large section of</div>
</div>the house with brewing equipment, and we have been sleeping peacefully for years. Most of the beers I make are more about flavor and sessionability than heavy hops and high ABV. I love those beers, don’t get me wrong, but there are so many styles out there that breweries are just recently discovering and experiment with. It’s an exciting time to be both a craft brewer and a beer drinker. Howard Street Brewing Company’s flagship beers are going to be a Pale Ale, a Red RyePA, a Saison, a Stout, and a Pilsner. These are the recipes that I have been focused on to really perfect the balance between the malt, yeast, and hops while capturing the style and essence of each beer.<br/> <div style=""margin:0 auto 0 auto;width: 695px;text-align: center;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;"">Where The Money Goes</div>
<hr/>
<div style=""margin:0 auto 0 auto;width: 695px;"">
<div style=""display: inline;float: left;width: 385px;"">Back in March, I did something crazy. I drove from Chicago to Albuquerque, New Mexico over 4 days to pick up a 1 BBL brew kettle, mash tun, liquor tank, burners, and some other brewing gear. I didn’t have any funding yet,but I knew I was going to be opening a brewery within the next 2 years. SoI bought the equipment without knowing when or where I would use it. I am very happy to say this will be installed on Howard Street. Also, check out Bombs Away and La Cumbre if you are ever in New Mexico. Wonderful people and delicious beers.<br/><br/>We have raised the bulk of the money we will need for our startup costs, including licenses, brite tanks, the bar, and refrigeration.

Then brewing for the SBAC Golf Outing, Pitchfest,Edgewater Chamberof Commerce Holiday Party, and many special nights for the Factory Theater.From home to outings to a new home for outings, this is the story ofChuck Patella and Howard Street Brewing Company.
 
 While sitting on a bar stool at the Rock Bottom Brewery in Chicago, IL, my buddy turned to me and said that he just started homebrewing. I had no idea what that meant, but I wanted to know more. We talked a lot about the intricacies of beer.  We talked about the process.  We talked about flavor profile.  We talked about all the different breweries in Chicago and Michigan.  I was infatuated with the process and the culture.  After I walked out of the bar that night, all I wanted to do was make beer. I dedicated myself to the study of beer: I visited breweries, listened intently to brewers when they spoke about their craft, read all the books I could find, and finally started creating recipes. After 10 years of brewing, events, and valuable feedback, I am finally ready to take beer making to the next level. I am opening a 1 Barrel tap room, Howard Street Brewing Company, on the northern edge of Rogers Park.
 
The First Beer:The first beer I ever made was an Irish Red Ale. It was a malt extract kit that came with dry yeast. It’s easily the worst beer I have ever made. To my credit, I've always taken sanitation seriously, so I don't think there was a bacterial infection. What it lacked in flavor, which was everything, it made up for in cleanliness. I had made very sanitary beer-flavored water. When the bottles started exploding in my closet from over carbonation, I realized I had some things to think about. Current Beers:


 fermentation room (aka utility closet in basement)
I've come a long way since my almost breakup from my then-girlfriend-now-loving-wife. When we both woke up screaming due to the sound of an exploding bottle (as I mention in the video, she is truly a saint), I wasn’t sure how much further she would go. Lucky for me, we just celebrated our 10-year wedding anniversary! Things are much safer now, both for the marriage and the bottles. I regularly brew my own all-grain recipes and kegging at home. I have taken over a large section of
the house with brewing equipment, and we have been sleeping peacefully for years. Most of the beers I make are more about flavor and sessionability than heavy hops and high ABV. I love those beers, don’t get me wrong, but there are so many styles out there that breweries are just recently discovering and experiment with. It’s an exciting time to be both a craft brewer and a beer drinker. Howard Street Brewing Company’s flagship beers are going to be a Pale Ale, a Red RyePA, a Saison, a Stout, and a Pilsner. These are the recipes that I have been focused on to really perfect the balance between the malt, yeast, and hops while capturing the style and essence of each beer. Where The Money Goes


Back in March, I did something crazy. I drove from Chicago to Albuquerque, New Mexico over 4 days to pick up a 1 BBL brew kettle, mash tun, liquor tank, burners, and some other brewing gear. I didn’t have any funding yet,but I knew I was going to be opening a brewery within the next 2 years. SoI bought the equipment without knowing when or where I would use it. I am very happy to say this will be installed on Howard Street. Also, check out Bombs Away and La Cumbre if you are ever in New Mexico. Wonderful people and delicious beers.We have raised the bulk of the money we will need for our startup costs, including licenses, brite tanks, the bar, and refrigeration. The money from this

 1 BBL Mashtun, Hot Liquor Tank, and Kettle.For scale: a 6 year old who dabs
campaign will be used towards the purchase of five 1 barrel jacketed conical fermentation tanks. These tanks will be also be fitted with temperature control, so the sky's the limit on the types of beer styles we can make!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We stand firm in our belief that healthy food shouldn’t taste like cardboard, and that delicious, opulent, indulgent food shouldn’t have poisonous ingredients. We infuse every ingredient, step in the process and the end product with reiki, to enhance the real sacredness of chocolate: the here and now moment of enjoyment where grace is present and healing occurs. </p>

<p><strong>Our daughter Olivia (6) who showed us a healthy way to enjoy decadence. </strong></p>
<p>We found out the hard way that sugar and toxic chemicals in the environment can plunge a child's experience into darkness. In early January 2017 our first-born daughter Olivia was suffering from excruciating tummy aches, nightmares, troubled thoughts and a stutter. It turned out sugar, petrochemicals and pollution were the culprits! We quickly removed these poisons from our bodies and environment and turned to essential oils, and her relief swept through our family like a wave of Grace. But that meant no chocolate!!! At least, no store bought, cheap, toxic candy. Her father Matthew studied, practiced, meditated, and came up with the unparalleled Red Wagon recipe. We tried it out - and it worked! </p>
<p>Within a few months the chocolate had two celebrity endorsements - celebrity chef Craig Chasky and fullback Heath Evans (representing his line of health food) both sampled and showcased the chocolates! To ensure safe doses of essential oils and the highest benefits from each ingredient, we secured the thumbs up from an award-winning nutritionist. </p>
<p>But just as we started receiving the first steady orders of chocolate, Hurricane Irma did her thing and Matthew was laid off. This displaced our family to Conifer, Colorado, where we were able to live thanks to the loving generosity of a dear friend.</p>

<p><strong><i>Olivia, Penelope and Rylan Tymerson - who took us in and opened his home to us. The cabin now also serves as a destination for healing retreats and chocolate making! </i></strong></p>
<p>A blessing in disguise! Not only have our daughters benefited immensely from the clean mountain air, but the community has welcomed us with open arms and showed phenomenal support for our chocolates! Within less than two months the chocolates are selling in five stores, and we have a bustling online shop and Facebook group. We host mountain view healing events at the cabin and share the art of chocolate, teaching our neighbors the process of conscious chocolate making, teaching the benefits of plant energy, and teaching the art of reiki as an ingredient. Our girls are homeschooled in the forest and the family is thriving! </p>

<p><i><strong>A homeschool project that helps the family business: Boxing and labeling teaches us focus, discipline, precision, trade, business, communication, exchange, marketing, design, and we get to spend some real quality time together knowing we are doing our bit for the world.</strong></i></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Our Vision</h2>
<p>We want to open a healing chocolate factory here in the mountains:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we have an open, commercial grade kitchen we can demonstrate the art of chocolate and teach the next generation of conscious candy makers.</li>
<li>With a space for healings, meditations, and guest crafters we can enhance the multi-sensory nature of healing.</li>
<li>We can sell high quantities of high quality craft chocolate spreading the body, mind and spirit benefits even further, making a strong profit and contributing to our community, leaving a legacy for our little daughters.</li>
<li>Your contribution will go directly to building this unique business model and making Conifer, Colorado a destination for high end chocolate healing retreats. </li>
</ul>
<p>You know what we love most about Conifer? Other than our family's health and happiness?</p>
<p>What about that moment when a snow cloud moves through the valley as we stand on the deck where we offer healing chocolate retreats, and for a moment we're suspended alongside the snowflakes - they aren't falling, we're just hanging here together, twinkling. A moment of poise - neither up nor down. Each one unique, its purpose and place perfectly etched into the moment. And each of them reflecting its own glimmer of the sun, its specific position amongst all the others creating that one spark that adds to a symphony of light. </p>

<p><strong><i>Shy but curious wild mule deer. </i></strong></p>
<p>But why is healing so important to us? Why not just make chocolate?</p>
<p>Because we believe that at the core of every soul’s purpose is the call to heal, elevate, nurture and illuminate all around us. Healing is simply “to make whole”, and by being the best we can be we are in great service to the world:</p>
<ul>
<li>We can heal directly, by studying the healing gifts of nature and creating healing remedies in the form of indulgent treats (enjoyment is very healing indeed).</li>
<li>We can cook healing chocolate and study nutrition and understand our bodies. We can understand the mind, psychology and critical thinking so we can better teach the power of alignment and choice.</li>
<li>We can study energy and the use of energy systems to affect change in the mind, body and spirit by using reiki, qi gong or prayer (which is a word we use for focused applied thought or intention).</li>
<li>We can heal through service to others, by engaging in our community and sharing our abundance with worthy causes that mean a lot to our customers and to us.</li>
<li>We can heal by conducting our business ethically, teaching our children about trade and communication, politics and civics, so that they can be a part of building a moral and ethical future.</li>
</ul>
<p>We believe that by creating a space to embody these healing principles as a fundamental part of the chocolate making process, and by sharing that space with all who desire a multi-sensory experience of enjoyment and delight, we will be serving at our highest. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need your help to get started. We're not looking to raise the full cost at first, but just enough to get our business pumping so we can earn what we need to bring our vision to Conifer, Colorado. </p>
<ul>
<li>We are operating successfully out of a cottage kitchen, but the restrictions of the cottage kitchen laws means we can't sell to grocery stores or restaurants. The current production cost per unit is $0.64 and each unit wholesales at $5 and retails at $8. At our current rate of production we can comfortably produce 1,600 units per month. In our first month operating in Conifer we sold 50 units, in the second month we sold 408, and we are projecting to sell in excess of 1,200 in March. </li>
<li>By incorporating a commercial kitchen into the cabin we can triple production without compromising on the quality that is so important to us. Current restrictions in production are not enough molds or refrigeration space, which means if we could solve those we could triple production without having to add staffing costs.</li>
<li>We grow our sales and earn the rest of the capital we need much quicker. We have been quoted $35,000 for this, but by using salvaged and recycled materials and doing as much as we can ourselves and with friends and neighbors, we are budgeting <strong>$10,000</strong> for the first round of commercial kitchen updates, and we'll work to earn the rest over time as we grow.  </li>
<li>We are budgeting <strong>$4000</strong> for the architectural drawings, legal fees and county application fees to approve the cabin for mixed use. </li>
<li>We currently market by social media, word of mouth and by engaging in the community and sharing our skills. We would do a passionate marketing push worldwide to attract visitors to the area and use chocolate as our vehicle for healing. We have been quoted some sky high prices for a marketing campaign but we know we could spend <strong>$1000</strong> with local marketers, as well as <strong>connecting with other businesses for a holistic, encompassing approach </strong>to sharing the message. </li>
<li>We're keeping a $5000 budget for Indigogo platform fees, taxes and contingency, and the production and shipping of perks. Any funds left over that don't go into these areas will be channeled into growing the business. </li>
</ul>

<h2>The Risks</h2>
<ul>
<li>We might not raise all the money first time round...</li>
<li>If we don't reach our goal, we will still invest in growing the business but at a smaller level, so we can earn the remaining capital. We firmly believe we can meet our goal, but the more money we raise the more able we are to bring our vision of a healing chocolate factory to Conifer, Colorado! Building a business is challenging, but we are a strong, resilient, positive and happy family and we are deeply passionate about what we do. We'll keep going. </li>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>I am so happy to share how amazing Red Wagon Organic Chocolate and Elizabeth is! The first time I met Elizabeth she protected so much light and positivity that I knew I needed her in my life! I enjoyed the chocolates she brought to share even though I am not a chocolate lover at all. I was all to happy to experience their there night of chocolates! I had the pleasure of blending my much needed essential oils and CBC to my batch of chocolates! The rekie healing session was amazing! Elizabeth truly helped me let go and embrace some really difficult things that have been going on❤ Just having the energy of friendship with Elizabeth, Matthew and their amazing girls has made an impact in my families life❤ They are the real deal! Truly incredible people with nothing but light and love in their hearts!</i></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Who knew chocolate could be this good...my new favorite is the Conifer Signature...with pine and frankincense...a close second is the Ignite (orange and frankincense). Healing oils in chocolate is brilliant! Nicely done!</i></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>I'm enjoying a taste of chocolate heaven,( infused with lavender, copaiba, &amp; frankincense) while supervising my stubborn son to practice the piano. This chocolate is all the calming I need after a long work week &amp; dealing with another sick kid. Thank you! #bestchocolatesever ????</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Hilda Williamz, Conifer, Colorado</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Conifer has a yogurt shop, ice cream shop, Natural Foods, and several restaurants and bars, but it does not have a chocolate shop. And what wonderful chocolate it is. No chocolate sold in the Conifer area even touches Red Wagon Organic Chocolates. We need this business here!</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Julia Sheldon Morris</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Matthew, I wish I could have made it home yesterday to check the mail, but the snow and ice had completely different plans. Your chocolate—absolutely incredible. I had a piece of the peppermint bar, and I was blown away. Truly. You can taste the quality of your craft. It had a beautiful mouth feel, and the decadence is enough to fulfill a craving for chocolate with even the smallest piece. The card was also a beautiful touch. I loved the artwork featured on the card! It truly shows the love your entire family puts into your craft, and makes things even more personal.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>I think the most amazing part of this experience was the declaration of worth on the back of your pamphlet. This is something that I believe humans as a whole lose sight of, but it was also something that resonated so strongly with me personally. I have left a very toxic relationship with a powerful narcissist, and my feelings of self-worth definitely suffered. I’ve been working hard to reconnect to myself and my value, and to see this printed in the most unexpected of places was a beautiful reminder. I plan on hanging this on my fridge to offer that reminder anytime I’m struggling.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Your chocolates are healing, your words are healing, and today—I am thankful for you and Red Wagon. Thank you and your entire family for what you do.”</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>These chocolates, especially for someone who often feels as though commercial chocolate is far too sweet, are absolutely incredible. They are deep, rich, and absolutely phenomenal morsels of love and healing. Thank you for sharing these awesome gifts with us! ❤️</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Jessica Ropke, New York</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Hey guys. I had a healing session with Elizabeth at Red Wagon and it was so amazing! I haven’t even received the chocolates yet! Just the session was worth it! To get a session, a meditation, an evaluation on your chakras. Some mantras to work on and then chocolate specifically designed for you is just so powerful!</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>I cannot wait for the chocolate! ? It is so profound to have the healing aspect within the involvement of enjoying the appetites of the human experience.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Mind in processing what is holding your head space; Spirit in the healing session; Body in the act of eating and digesting the chocolates while the essential oils do their work in raising your frequencies. Then the masculine and feminine conduits who team up to make it all in one chocolate bar.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Thank you Holly for this gift! And thank you Red Wagon for your teamwork in bringing it all together.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Kate Karpel, St Petersburg, Florida</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> <i>Oh my? Not only is this good chocolate, but the reiki is strong, people... it is PUNGENT! And even further enhanced by essential oils and cocoa. I say it’s pure magic. I actually start and finish my day with a bite of Red Wagon ?Thank god it’s healthy! Can’t wait for the online event!!</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Sylvia Swann, Oslo, Norway</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> <i>Wow, thank you Red Wagon Tribe. So you wanted to test out how successfully your healing chocolates would ship all the way to the UK! The answer is Perfectly! Thank you for using us as your guinea pigs, the pleasure was all ours! As someone who is mindful of what I put in both mine and my toddlers bodies, it is incredible to find something as indulgent as chocolate but without all the nasties. Even better, it replaces the nasties with pure and therapeutic ingredients. We sampled Ode to Love and Deep Dark and they were beautiful and a delight to savour every mouthful. True evidence that chocolate can be delicious, indulgent and nourish AND can be good for you. We loved them both.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>The packaging was beautiful and simple. I loved your story of your journey that has lead to you creating such divine yumminess. It's an inspiration.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>On another plus, because of the rich and pure ingredients your cravings are satisfied with just a small amount of chocolate ( this never usually happens for me), meaning you can savour every bite, and make it last longer. So much better for your health, mind and purse :). We can't wait to try more.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Kama Wager, Buckinghamshire, UK</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i> I want to share with you all my testimonial for these beautiful people. To quote Kahlil Gibrahn, Matthew and Elizabeth are certainly walking their ""path with a heart"". Their strength of purpose and honour in combining love and healing with pure divine chocolate, proving that delicious treats can come from simple, organic, natural ingredients without any of the nasties, is unrivaled. Their consciousness in their approach to nutrition and wellness as well as their love for their family and community is so wonderfully inspiring. You can't help but melt when you see their super cute and gorgeously happy chocolate covered girls! If ever there was a couple that deserved to achieve their dreams of spreading opulent deliciousness, love and healing in every one of their handcrafted organic chocolates, it is most certainly the beautiful spirits of Matthew and Elizabeth, Red Wagon Organic Chocolates! I wish you both so much love and light as you continue on this incredible soul path together. ???</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> Tina Roberts, UK</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>To me self-healing is really important. Some people call it self love. I call it taking care and being compassionate towards yourself. I believe self healing starts at the roots; the food you eat, the air you breathe, and even thoughts you keep. I LOVE Red Wagon Organic Chocolates because you not only have healing organic ingredients including high grade essential oils, but they were crafted with a lot of LOVE from the start. I think these healing chocolates are an ingenious idea! I can't wait to see what other yummy healing chocolate combinations you come up with next!!!</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> Mandy Handly, Florida</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Just received my chocolate in the mail. Couldn't be more delicious! The dark chocolate peppermint melts in your mouth with no bitter after taste. Thank you, Matt and Elizabeth!</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> Natalie Tibbets, Orlando, Florida</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Matt and Elizabeth devote their lives to making the world a better place. They are conscious and intentional in all they are engaged in on every level: physical, emotional, mental and spiritual.</i></p>

We stand firm in our belief that healthy food shouldn’t taste like cardboard, and that delicious, opulent, indulgent food shouldn’t have poisonous ingredients. We infuse every ingredient, step in the process and the end product with reiki, to enhance the real sacredness of chocolate: the here and now moment of enjoyment where grace is present and healing occurs. 

Our daughter Olivia (6) who showed us a healthy way to enjoy decadence. 
We found out the hard way that sugar and toxic chemicals in the environment can plunge a child's experience into darkness. In early January 2017 our first-born daughter Olivia was suffering from excruciating tummy aches, nightmares, troubled thoughts and a stutter. It turned out sugar, petrochemicals and pollution were the culprits! We quickly removed these poisons from our bodies and environment and turned to essential oils, and her relief swept through our family like a wave of Grace. But that meant no chocolate!!! At least, no store bought, cheap, toxic candy. Her father Matthew studied, practiced, meditated, and came up with the unparalleled Red Wagon recipe. We tried it out - and it worked! 
Within a few months the chocolate had two celebrity endorsements - celebrity chef Craig Chasky and fullback Heath Evans (representing his line of health food) both sampled and showcased the chocolates! To ensure safe doses of essential oils and the highest benefits from each ingredient, we secured the thumbs up from an award-winning nutritionist. 
But just as we started receiving the first steady orders of chocolate, Hurricane Irma did her thing and Matthew was laid off. This displaced our family to Conifer, Colorado, where we were able to live thanks to the loving generosity of a dear friend.

Olivia, Penelope and Rylan Tymerson - who took us in and opened his home to us. The cabin now also serves as a destination for healing retreats and chocolate making! 
A blessing in disguise! Not only have our daughters benefited immensely from the clean mountain air, but the community has welcomed us with open arms and showed phenomenal support for our chocolates! Within less than two months the chocolates are selling in five stores, and we have a bustling online shop and Facebook group. We host mountain view healing events at the cabin and share the art of chocolate, teaching our neighbors the process of conscious chocolate making, teaching the benefits of plant energy, and teaching the art of reiki as an ingredient. Our girls are homeschooled in the forest and the family is thriving! 

A homeschool project that helps the family business: Boxing and labeling teaches us focus, discipline, precision, trade, business, communication, exchange, marketing, design, and we get to spend some real quality time together knowing we are doing our bit for the world.
 
Our Vision
We want to open a healing chocolate factory here in the mountains:

If we have an open, commercial grade kitchen we can demonstrate the art of chocolate and teach the next generation of conscious candy makers.
With a space for healings, meditations, and guest crafters we can enhance the multi-sensory nature of healing.
We can sell high quantities of high quality craft chocolate spreading the body, mind and spirit benefits even further, making a strong profit and contributing to our community, leaving a legacy for our little daughters.
Your contribution will go directly to building this unique business model and making Conifer, Colorado a destination for high end chocolate healing retreats. 

You know what we love most about Conifer? Other than our family's health and happiness?
What about that moment when a snow cloud moves through the valley as we stand on the deck where we offer healing chocolate retreats, and for a moment we're suspended alongside the snowflakes - they aren't falling, we're just hanging here together, twinkling. A moment of poise - neither up nor down. Each one unique, its purpose and place perfectly etched into the moment. And each of them reflecting its own glimmer of the sun, its specific position amongst all the others creating that one spark that adds to a symphony of light. 

The view from the Red Wagon chocolate cabin.
Or maybe when the day just weighs heavy on the soul, not for any good reason, when the 23 things to worry about shout louder than the billion things to rejoice over, and we step outside to remind us why we're here and THESE souls come to greet us. 

Shy but curious wild mule deer. 
But why is healing so important to us? Why not just make chocolate?
Because we believe that at the core of every soul’s purpose is the call to heal, elevate, nurture and illuminate all around us. Healing is simply “to make whole”, and by being the best we can be we are in great service to the world:

We can heal directly, by studying the healing gifts of nature and creating healing remedies in the form of indulgent treats (enjoyment is very healing indeed).
We can cook healing chocolate and study nutrition and understand our bodies. We can understand the mind, psychology and critical thinking so we can better teach the power of alignment and choice.
We can study energy and the use of energy systems to affect change in the mind, body and spirit by using reiki, qi gong or prayer (which is a word we use for focused applied thought or intention).
We can heal through service to others, by engaging in our community and sharing our abundance with worthy causes that mean a lot to our customers and to us.
We can heal by conducting our business ethically, teaching our children about trade and communication, politics and civics, so that they can be a part of building a moral and ethical future.

We believe that by creating a space to embody these healing principles as a fundamental part of the chocolate making process, and by sharing that space with all who desire a multi-sensory experience of enjoyment and delight, we will be serving at our highest.

What We Need & What You Get
We need your help to get started. We're not looking to raise the full cost at first, but just enough to get our business pumping so we can earn what we need to bring our vision to Conifer, Colorado. 

We are operating successfully out of a cottage kitchen, but the restrictions of the cottage kitchen laws means we can't sell to grocery stores or restaurants. The current production cost per unit is $0.64 and each unit wholesales at $5 and retails at $8. At our current rate of production we can comfortably produce 1,600 units per month. In our first month operating in Conifer we sold 50 units, in the second month we sold 408, and we are projecting to sell in excess of 1,200 in March. 
By incorporating a commercial kitchen into the cabin we can triple production without compromising on the quality that is so important to us. Current restrictions in production are not enough molds or refrigeration space, which means if we could solve those we could triple production without having to add staffing costs.
We grow our sales and earn the rest of the capital we need much quicker. We have been quoted $35,000 for this, but by using salvaged and recycled materials and doing as much as we can ourselves and with friends and neighbors, we are budgeting $10,000 for the first round of commercial kitchen updates, and we'll work to earn the rest over time as we grow.  
We are budgeting $4000 for the architectural drawings, legal fees and county application fees to approve the cabin for mixed use. 
We currently market by social media, word of mouth and by engaging in the community and sharing our skills. We would do a passionate marketing push worldwide to attract visitors to the area and use chocolate as our vehicle for healing. We have been quoted some sky high prices for a marketing campaign but we know we could spend $1000 with local marketers, as well as connecting with other businesses for a holistic, encompassing approach to sharing the message. 
We're keeping a $5000 budget for Indigogo platform fees, taxes and contingency, and the production and shipping of perks. Any funds left over that don't go into these areas will be channeled into growing the business.

Your chocolates are healing, your words are healing, and today—I am thankful for you and Red Wagon. Thank you and your entire family for what you do.”
These chocolates, especially for someone who often feels as though commercial chocolate is far too sweet, are absolutely incredible. They are deep, rich, and absolutely phenomenal morsels of love and healing. Thank you for sharing these awesome gifts with us! ❤️
Jessica Ropke, New York
Hey guys. I had a healing session with Elizabeth at Red Wagon and it was so amazing! I haven’t even received the chocolates yet! Just the session was worth it! To get a session, a meditation, an evaluation on your chakras. Some mantras to work on and then chocolate specifically designed for you is just so powerful!
I cannot wait for the chocolate! ? It is so profound to have the healing aspect within the involvement of enjoying the appetites of the human experience.
Mind in processing what is holding your head space; Spirit in the healing session; Body in the act of eating and digesting the chocolates while the essential oils do their work in raising your frequencies. Then the masculine and feminine conduits who team up to make it all in one chocolate bar.
Thank you Holly for this gift! And thank you Red Wagon for your teamwork in bringing it all together.

 Oh my? Not only is this good chocolate, but the reiki is strong, people... it is PUNGENT! And even further enhanced by essential oils and cocoa. I say it’s pure magic. I actually start and finish my day with a bite of Red Wagon ?Thank god it’s healthy! Can’t wait for the online event!!
Sylvia Swann, Oslo, Norway
 Wow, thank you Red Wagon Tribe. So you wanted to test out how successfully your healing chocolates would ship all the way to the UK! The answer is Perfectly! Thank you for using us as your guinea pigs, the pleasure was all ours! As someone who is mindful of what I put in both mine and my toddlers bodies, it is incredible to find something as indulgent as chocolate but without all the nasties. Even better, it replaces the nasties with pure and therapeutic ingredients. We sampled Ode to Love and Deep Dark and they were beautiful and a delight to savour every mouthful. True evidence that chocolate can be delicious, indulgent and nourish AND can be good for you. We loved them both.
The packaging was beautiful and simple. I loved your story of your journey that has lead to you creating such divine yumminess. It's an inspiration.
On another plus, because of the rich and pure ingredients your cravings are satisfied with just a small amount of chocolate ( this never usually happens for me), meaning you can savour every bite, and make it last longer. So much better for your health, mind and purse :). We can't wait to try more.
Kama Wager, Buckinghamshire, UK
 I want to share with you all my testimonial for these beautiful people. To quote Kahlil Gibrahn, Matthew and Elizabeth are certainly walking their ""path with a heart"". Their strength of purpose and honour in combining love and healing with pure divine chocolate, proving that delicious treats can come from simple, organic, natural ingredients without any of the nasties, is unrivaled. Their consciousness in their approach to nutrition and wellness as well as their love for their family and community is so wonderfully inspiring. You can't help but melt when you see their super cute and gorgeously happy chocolate covered girls! If ever there was a couple that deserved to achieve their dreams of spreading opulent deliciousness, love and healing in every one of their handcrafted organic chocolates, it is most certainly the beautiful spirits of Matthew and Elizabeth, Red Wagon Organic Chocolates! I wish you both so much love and light as you continue on this incredible soul path together. ???
 Tina Roberts, UK
To me self-healing is really important. Some people call it self love. I call it taking care and being compassionate towards yourself. I believe self healing starts at the roots; the food you eat, the air you breathe, and even thoughts you keep. I LOVE Red Wagon Organic Chocolates because you not only have healing organic ingredients including high grade essential oils, but they were crafted with a lot of LOVE from the start. I think these healing chocolates are an ingenious idea! I can't wait to see what other yummy healing chocolate combinations you come up with next!!!
 Mandy Handly, Florida
Just received my chocolate in the mail. Couldn't be more delicious! The dark chocolate peppermint melts in your mouth with no bitter after taste. Thank you, Matt and Elizabeth!
 Natalie Tibbets, Orlando, Florida
Matt and Elizabeth devote their lives to making the world a better place. They are conscious and intentional in all they are engaged in on every level: physical, emotional, mental and spiritual.

 ORGANIC VEGAN:     
     Introducing Tasty And Nutritious  Organic Vegan Snacks and  Rice Syrup 
     OUR STORY   When the meat dairy production in Large-scale land, 83% of farmland worldwide makes vegetation restoration, absorption of CO2 should be incredible. Greenhouse gas reduction effect through improvement of global food system.   Traditional conservation methods are also necessary, such as designating new protected areas and preparing regulations to rescue specific species, but to save nature at the global level, we ultimately need to change the way we eat and produce it.  We should change our diet to vegetarian food or vegan and reduce demand for meat or dairy products and restores the land used to produce them.   Thereby absorbing CO2 and reducing global temperature.  CO2 emissions must be reduced by 45% in order to reduce global temperature by 1.5 degrees. Vegan uses only 50% carbon, 1/11 oil, 1/13 water and 7/18 soil compared to meat.A vegetarian diet to breathe global warming.  In conclusion, the link between vegetarianism and veganism is directly linked to forest and ecosystem restoration and short-term greenhouse gas reduction, which can lead to significant time gains toward a low-carbon energy system that reaches its critical point.Organic products are invaluable.   The importance of this method of farming constantly sounded in certain term.   Our environment is dependent on the way our foods are grown.Scientists on Climate Change Countermeasure Committee  Say Organic Vegan Products are the Shortcut to Restoring the Global Environment.  The Paris Climate Agreement signed and various voices responding to climate attacks are a global trend.   Many diseases also emerged from a contaminated global environment.   The Practice of Organic Vegan is the shortcut to saving the planet Earth.$20 will be donated for Climate Change Countermeasure when you order Early Bird 2 Set Special Perk.Increased greenhouse gas emission (the major cause of global warming - a discussion for another day), soil erosion, water pollution, and a threat to human health, has been proven to be the dividends of the conventional farming method.   On the other hand, Organic farming tends to be better for the environment.   This farming method has rewarded us with reduced pollution, increased soil fertility, and a replenished natural ecosystem for more clean air and water amidst others.However, despite the excelling value of organic farming over its counterpart, it only makes up a small share of the United States  farming.   According to data by the National Agricultural statistics service, as of 2016, there were about 5 million certified organic farmland, which is less than 1% of the 910 million acres of farmland across the country.   According to recent industry statistics (Nutrition Business Journal), organic products account for only about 4 percent (4%) of the total U.S. food sales. As far as we are concerned, it is not fair enough, we believe there should be a better way.   We thought of Organic Vegan Corporation. OUR COMPANYOrganic Vegan Corporation   is a Korea Agricultural Corporation established the year 2010, to save humanity and the earth and spread the distribution, cultivation, and consumption of organic products.   It is a way of protecting the earth beyond the value of health and making use of the land as an organic field. “Deul Haneul”, which means, “field and sky” is the brand name for all our healthily grown organic products - that is products produced without the use of pesticides, chemical fertilizers, and herbicides.Because meeting the needs for healthy food is at the heart of our products, it gladdens our heart to see our products being at the receiving end of stupendous international recognition over the past two years.The time has now come to add to our products gallery.

<p>In 1980, our parents emigrated from Cambodia as refugees fleeing the Khmer Rouge genocide.  In 1987, they opened Phnom Penh Noodle House.  As the only Cambodian restaurant in Seattle, Phnom Penh was the cultural hub of the Cambodian community in greater Seattle and beyond for more than 30 years. </p>
<p>Our parents passed the restaurant down to us 3 sisters when they retired.  Unfortunately, due to a family tragedy, we decided to close the business in May, 2018.  Dawn’s son, Devin was hit by a car and suffered severe traumatic brain injuries.   He was a senior at Franklin High School and an ultimate frisbee superstar!  We needed to step away to focus on our families, heal, and help Dawn, Devin, and her other 2 kiddos transition to this new way of life.</p>
<p>It’s been an incredibly difficult 2 years.  Devin still has a long road to recovery and we're still adjusting, but we're in a much better spot.  Mainly due to the love, support, and words of encouragement from this community.    </p>
<p>It's because of YOU and the help of community efforts &amp; resources, that we’re on track to            re-open the restaurant! </p>
<p>We are oh-so-close, but we need a little more help.  Build-out costs are proliferating.  We need to raise additional funds to complete construction and get us to grand opening!  </p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>We're Larry and Jackie from Sylvan Hills farm outside of Menomonie WI, and we've been growing organic produce for 15 years which includes garlic to 5 cooperatives and a small CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) with about 40 - 70 families that purchase a share of veggies weekly from summer through fall. We pick the produce and deliver it within 24hours. Produce can lose 25 to 50 percent of it's nutrition within the first 24 to 48 hours. We also donate surplus produce to the local food shelf (we believe that those who are on the low end of the income stream deserve the highest quality nutritional food they can get.) Our old tractor (Big Joe) died last fall with a hole in the engine block, and we have not had any luck in finding a replacement engine or engine block to repair it. So we need a replacement tractor ASAP. The rush is that it won't be long till we need to plant the garlic and the tractor is used to cut and deliver the mulch to protect the garlic from being winter killed. The reason we want our own tractor is that you have small windows of opportunity to do the things the tractor does, and trying to find someone with one or rent one doesn't work well at all. (We have done this in the past.) Most of the time, they are busy or the tractor is being used by someone else.</p>
<p>We have gardened organically since we were children, and we dreamed of the farm we are on while living in the big Twin Cities for 9 years and before that. We always wanted to be out in the country, working the land. Our previous jobs were in the energy conservation field and the computer printing industry. As technology changes very quickly, the business faded away in the Twin Cities and we needed to find that farm we dreamed of. Be careful of what you ask for, as this farm dropped into our laps only a month after looking, and all the 9 years of dreaming of it brought our farm to reality in September of 2000. We managed to double our CSA each year from the start in 2003 until 2008, when we lost about 3/4 of our memberships due to the housing collapse. We have been able to slowly build the members to about 2/3rds of what it was in 2008. Adding more garlic yearly has helped keep us afloat, but we are at the maximum of our work load now. A big expense, like the tractor we need would REALLY HELP us significantly at this time, when we need the equipment ASAP to mulch the garlic. The tractor is also used to prepare ground and weed control for the CSA.</p>
<p>Song birds have always been important to us, in fact near and dear to our hearts. We avoid cutting any of our grassy hay until after September, since they migrate south anytime between July and September. This allows them to use the hay ground as nesting sites for their babies. The populations of dickcissel, bobolinks (see bobolink video below), and meadow larks are all in decline, so seeing these birds return yearly brings us great joy! We also work around the nests of kill deer birds, which like to build right inside of the garden. It's a spectacular sight to see these babies hopping in a row after Mom (like ducklings) almost immediately after they are hatched. They're a puff ball of white feathers the first few days of their life - cute as the dickens.</p>
<p>Our farm is probably the most important thing in our lives, next to family. We plan to stay here and protect this piece of land as long as we are able, and also to pass it off when we go as designated organic only in a land trust.</p>
<p>You will help us continue to farm and protect the song birds at the same time while allowing our members to continue receiving great food, and protect the planet as well with organic standards. You will be contributing greatly back to the planet, as the United Nations reports, ""Small organic farms are THE WAY TO FEED THE WORLD""</p>

<h3>Welcome to Chez Dine !  </h3>
<p>Founded by Hamilton native Jen Stokes, Chez Dine has evolved from a one woman show to a growing team of 3 and a community of 1000 diners &amp; 65 hosts. A passionate member of McMaster's Forge Incubator program, Chez Dine is one of the fastest growing start-ups in the city!  </p>
<p>Chez Dine allows Hosts to connect with guests seeking a unique experience - outside of that normally found in a restaurant.</p>
<p>Our quickly expanding group of hosts include chefs, foodies and health nuts, eager to serve up the most Instagram worthy dish possible! Our platform aims to connect people who love to cook good food with people who love to consume good food. Giving consumers a much needed new option in their dining portfolio! <br/><br/>As a guest you can order two loafs of freshly baked banana bread from the Mrs. Miller down the street or you can book Chef Heather to come to your home on Friday night to cook dinner for you and your new boyfriend's parents!  Or you can become a host and offer your art and talent to the world and invite others into your home ! </p>
<p>Chez Dine aims to connect people over food - giving them a 'Taste of Togetherness'</p>
<p>In the past twelve months Chez Dines efforts have been focused on fine-tuning the platform design, building a market base and testing the market response to our business model. We have focused our efforts on building a user base and connecting our hosts with guests and ensuring fantastic experiences for our Hosts &amp; Guests. </p>
<p>Business is booming! BUT, we need your help to sustain our growth and be able to bring our unique experiences to more Diners around Canada! </p>
<p>YOU GET WHAT YOU GIVE funds will be allocated towards web development costs and launching our sales team cross country to take Chez Dine beyond Hamilton's boarders! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To break it down for you;</p>
<p>We need funds to feed our team while we continue to bust our a** growing the platform. We think this is a great idea because EVERYONE that has dined with us has LOVED it. Don't believe us? Check out the perk ""Cook for You' and have a Chez Dine Host come to your house and see for yourself! </p>
<p>Our community has rallied behind us (THANK YOU HAMILTON!) and contributed some amazing perks, from hotel stays, Ti-cats tickets and yoga passes! They are all available for half the price of the original value (because we love our supporters). Pick what's right for you or declare yourself a Friend of the Founder and support Chez Dine's ultimate goal of connecting people over the power of a meal!  </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are so thankful of our fortunate place in todays world, but realize not everyone is so lucky. We want to give back by launching a program temporarily dubbed ""Eat to Drink"". A portion of the profit from every plate served will be donated to providing clean water in third world countries. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our number one risk is competition in the marketplace, we are not the first company to strive for uniques dining experiences and we will not be the last. What differentiates Chez Dine is it's community centred  approach and connection to the Diner. Our biggest challenge is our acceleration of growth. We have the ideas, platform and user-base.

<li>We work exclusively with Grass-Fed/Finished Beef, Organic Turkeys, and Heritage Pork. They come at a premium, but <b>health/treatment of the animals is important to us, as it relates to what you're putting in your bodies</b>.<br/> </li>
<li>
<b>We use only the purest ingredients available</b>. We don't add extra preservatives or chemicals to enhance color, flavor, texture, or shelf-life. We don't need to. The other brands can own that mantle.<br/> </li>
<li>For thousands of years, human civilizations have cured, dried, and salted meat. <b>Jerky was paleo before paleo was cool. Crossfit?Spinning? Triathlons? Yoga Class? We've got your clean energy needs covered</b>. It's portable, high in nutrition, and can travel long distances without spoiling. It's the ultimate brain and body fuel.<br/> </li>
<li>
<b>Our jerky is better for you as a snack or mini-meal-replacement than almost any other food option on the market. It's also better-tasting</b>. We feed our kids this stuff. We'll feed your kids this stuff. We don't take that responsibility lightly.</li>

We travel and do a tremendous amount of diligence on said farms prior to engaging in a relationship with our provider. <b>We apply Michelin Star Restaurant-level standards of sourcing</b>.</p><p>2) <b>We use Japanese Steel to butcher the meat</b>. We like knives. We're open to using German Steel but at the moment our preference is Japanese. It's sharper, and doesn't micro-bruise the meat. You probably don't care about all of this, so we'll move on. </p><p>3) <b>We bathe the meats in a variety of proprietary baths that we've perfected over the years</b>. All the ingredients that go into our marinades are hand-picked, much like our meat. Some spices and sauces/solutions are quite ""difficult"" to get, but we've spent a lot of time figuring it out. Think small cargo planes, jungles, conflicts, and weird bugs trying to eat us alive type of stuff. Pierre has had Malaria 6 times. </p><p>4) <b>We marinate the meat in controlled environments, maintaining optimal levels of temperature and air quality for 3-5 days, depending on the product</b>. We rotate and massage the mixture as needed according to oxygenation and surface-area penetration requirements. </p><p>5) <b>We ""cook"" the meat for 6-10 hours at 145° - 165°, depending on the product</b>. We use Excalibur Dehydrators exclusively at the moment, because we find them best in class. Some products will then go on to one last stage of finishing, or rest, before vacuum-seal packaging.

Check it out! ""If these samples from Brothers Artisanal Jerky say anything, it's that the company is certainly going to be a big hit.""Hi. My name is Phil, and we're making the best-tasting, healthy, uniquely-flavored jerky on the planet.I've spent the past decade of my existence starting and running tech companies. I'm a big foodie and I love to cook - a trait I share with my older brother, Pierre. Long story short, a while back we stumbled on to an old family recipe for beef jerky. Super old. Civil-War-parchment-paper old. So we made some. Then we made some more. After years of tinkering, we got pretty good at it. We consulted experts in meat, farming, herbalism, chemistry, gastronomy, nutrition, and everything else under the sun. What we ended up with is the best-tasting, healthy, uniquely-flavored jerky on the planet. Science!  We scour the earth for the best ingredients, using time-honored cooking methods that focus on health and flavor. Then we ship it fresh to your door. Thanks for spending some time with us. We're glad you're here. 
We infuse iconic international and regional dishes into organic, pure, farm-raised meat. Everything authentic, everything local, ingredients shipped to us overnight if necessary. We create, taste, test, repeat, and perfect. We're always working. All we care about is infusing flavors into our healthy, portable, mind-bendingly delicious jerky. You'll be able to taste the difference. This isn't jerky. It's fuel for your body and brain. This is Brothers. Carolina Dip Turkey, Tom Kha Thai Turkey, & Pistachio Lemon Schwarma Some notes about our product:
We work exclusively with Grass-Fed/Finished Beef, Organic Turkeys, and Heritage Pork. They come at a premium, but health/treatment of the animals is important to us, as it relates to what you're putting in your bodies. 

We use only the purest ingredients available. We don't add extra preservatives or chemicals to enhance color, flavor, texture, or shelf-life. We don't need to. The other brands can own that mantle. 
For thousands of years, human civilizations have cured, dried, and salted meat. Jerky was paleo before paleo was cool. Crossfit?Spinning? Triathlons? Yoga Class? We've got your clean energy needs covered. It's portable, high in nutrition, and can travel long distances without spoiling. It's the ultimate brain and body fuel. 

Our jerky is better for you as a snack or mini-meal-replacement than almost any other food option on the market. It's also better-tasting. We feed our kids this stuff. We'll feed your kids this stuff. We don't take that responsibility lightly.
 1) First, we source the meat or substrate (if/when we expand into vegan options) from local farms. We abide by the ""all local, all the time"" mantra. We travel and do a tremendous amount of diligence on said farms prior to engaging in a relationship with our provider. We apply Michelin Star Restaurant-level standards of sourcing.2) We use Japanese Steel to butcher the meat. We like knives. We're open to using German Steel but at the moment our preference is Japanese. It's sharper, and doesn't micro-bruise the meat. You probably don't care about all of this, so we'll move on. 3) We bathe the meats in a variety of proprietary baths that we've perfected over the years. All the ingredients that go into our marinades are hand-picked, much like our meat. Some spices and sauces/solutions are quite ""difficult"" to get, but we've spent a lot of time figuring it out. Think small cargo planes, jungles, conflicts, and weird bugs trying to eat us alive type of stuff. Pierre has had Malaria 6 times. 4) We marinate the meat in controlled environments, maintaining optimal levels of temperature and air quality for 3-5 days, depending on the product. We rotate and massage the mixture as needed according to oxygenation and surface-area penetration requirements. 5) We ""cook"" the meat for 6-10 hours at 145° - 165°, depending on the product. We use Excalibur Dehydrators exclusively at the moment, because we find them best in class. Some products will then go on to one last stage of finishing, or rest, before vacuum-seal packaging. It's all about the flavor. 6) We send it to your doorstep or office, as quickly as is humanly possible according to the laws of physics. Tom Kha Thai Turkey We believe in transparency - as fellow humans, as a company, and as a brand. Our goal is to make Brothers your go-to destination for all things jerky. In doing so, we'll commit to charging you fair and honest prices for our product.

<p>Hi! Chris Oltyan, CEO of Alkyhaul, and I’m really excited about how close we are to making the Alkyhaul a reality!</p>
<p>When I started homebrewing, I did things in a pretty standard manner, but I quickly started experimenting and trying to up my game. When I decided to start a few batch of cider, I quickly learned that experimentation can be pretty painful. See, I started 5 small batches at a time, all with slightly different recipes, yeasts, and sugars, and it quickly became a nightmare. Doing hydrometer readings for all the bottles was not only time consuming, but I lost so much product! Topping it off with the fact that I only really got two useful readings, and I was left with more questions than answers. I know that people could blow into a tube and know how much alcohol could be in your system, so I figured why not do something like that for homebrew?</p>
<p>I met Wil, the CTO of Alkyhaul, at an event, and when I pitched him the idea and showed him the sensors I wanted to use. He was impressed with how feasible it seemed and how much people seemed to want something like this. So impressed that we started a company and built a prototype unit a few weeks later.</p>
<p>We spent the next year gathering data and being pleasantly surprised with how well the device was working. We know how important accuracy is, so we also started conversations with a local university’s brewery sciences department (What can I say, we live in Colorado) and they were likewise excited about the idea. They agreed to do additional testing for us and also put in a early order for units.</p>
<p>We’ve been working hard these past few months establishing the relationships we need to manufacture the device and we’re finally ready to start making units. We really appreciate your support and if you have any feature requests let us know!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Several years ago, a small town convenience store went out of business, leaving local residents, especially those without transportation without a place to buy staples like food.  As the building lay dormant and empty,  Matt and his wife dreamed of providing a local market and community hub in the heart of the area in which they live in Plant City Florida. The abandoned building is for sale and Matt and his wife are ready to purchase it and turn it into their dream to better the community.  The building however needs fully restored, Matt who is a local farmer and tradesman and would love to turn this vacant building into a Farmer's Market to not only provide food staples to the community but a place for people to come and enjoy with his locally grown food, a sandwich, a healthy smoothie made from his homegrown crops and berries or a nice cup of coffee. Also onsite in another building will be Matt The Welder's Equipment Repair.</p>
<p>Together,  we can make this happen!  Passionate about locally-sourced ingredients cooking, their mission is to create a neighborhood store that gives back to the community in so many ways. That nurtures connection with the community, the environment, local farmers and makers.</p>
</div><div><p> </p></div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are working hard to open the market, but we need your help! To provide the delicious  prepared foods and fresh local produce our community desires, we need the building and equipment to prepare them. The money we raise will go directly to procuring the building,  ovens, mixers, juicers, refrigeration, and shelving, that will allow us to showcase the bounty of small town Plant City!</p>
<p> We’ve got all levels of contributions and prizes and we appreciate any amount you’re able to help us open our doors!</p>
<p>Your contribution to our campaign will help provide:</p>
<p>a central hub for gathering and connecting with the community</p>
<p>employment for members of the community</p>
<p>a marketplace for local farmers and artisans to share their product without having to ship it far away</p>
<p>healthy delicious foods and household necessities for people that would otherwise need to transportation to find them</p>
<p>the opportunity for money to stay within Hillsborough County and improve our local economy</p>
<p>benefits to our environment by lessening the distance our food travels</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our vision is to create a community market in the truest sense. This means that everyone in our community has an opportunity to make this dream a reality. This will help us fund the needed construction and infrastructure to build out the market. If you are interested in putting your money to work in a grass-roots local market, alongside building an asset for our community, we invite you to connect with us and explore the possibilities.</p>

<h2> </h2>
<h2><strong>The Mission!</strong></h2>
<p>The amount of waste we create on this planet is SO WRONG!!! We want to change this as soon as possible!</p>
<p>Bringing a new product into this world is very exciting but creating more waste is not! So our mission to use recycled ocean waste for our packaging so we are removing plastic from the ocean &amp; using it to produce our product packaging.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What's the Product?</h2>
<p>Off Grid is a Dissolvable energy tablet. Made up of sustainably sourced ingredients from the best corners of the world! We have selected the most natural herbal extracts &amp; caffeine to give you a big boost without the side effects of traditional energy drinks.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Energy drinks are made up of 80% water, huh? The Raw ingredients of an energy drink are actually a very small amount of what's put in the Can. We thought it would be better to produce the drink in a tablet form, so you get all the good stuff &amp; then just add water to it before use.</p>
<p>Allowing you to save on storage, money and reduce your waste as there 10 tabs in a tube.</p>
<p><strong>Because fitting x10 cans in your bag would just be a waste!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>How we get it done!</strong></h3>
<p>Our Ocean Waste Plastic is mainly collected in and around the Phillipine Sea, the Carribean Sea, and the Indian Ocean. After being collected the plastic is transported to our processing partners in Indonesia, USA and China.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555313799/ndtrfgxhk7a7hd7qqefr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Recycle Process:</h3>
<p>The Process starts with the collection of ocean plastics. With help from our partners, we initiate clean-up expeditions to collect plastic from the oceans, rivers and beaches. It is then transported to the sorting facilities. The plastic is received in a compressed format, ready to be sorted, washed, rinsed, shredded and made into pellets.</p>

<h3> </h3>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need from you!</h3>
<p><strong>Where will the funding go?</strong> Producing ocean waste recycled materials can really add up in costs as well as sourcing natural ingredients from their origin countries. We would really love your support to help us gather, breakdown and reuse the plastic from the ocean back to Europe mainland to start its life again as our product packaging.</p>

<h3>An Amazing Story...</h3>
<p>Hi this is Gabe, I'm 23 years old from the beautiful country of El Salvador in Central America. I've just decided to make the best decision ever in order to expand my vegan business and also enlarge the vegan community inside my country and to hopefully spread this idea all around Central America.Veganism changed my life drastically in every aspect and since then I knew I had to do something to let everybody know about the benefits of this growing trend. I knew that everybody loves tacos and also that I could convert this idea into a delicious vegan fast food concept and then the concept was born. This campaign is incredibly important for me not just because it will affect my life, but because I truly believe that this will have a huge impact within my community by helping to promote a more healthy way of living and by gradually making a shift inside the fast food industry in my country and beyond.</p>
<p>ME APPEARING LIVE IN A US CHANNEL.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khEM9KQsnCo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khEM9KQsnCo</a></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; Why</h3>
<p>Thank you for your interest in this project! If the campaign´s goal is reached, the funds will be broken down into several sections in order to fulfill the needs of the entire business .These sections are organized from the beginning to the final goal which is marketing the business and growing  influence inside social networks.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529340605/fvxqyol09ahtjuxlevn5.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The main aspects of the business are the motorcycles which will carry the entire equipment as well as the product. For this purpose I need to purchase small motorcycles to carry carts around the city and a bigger Tuk Tuk for social events and special gatherings.The costs are the following.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527175989/unlmjlrtlv05lwumfwuc.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>MASESA is the dealership I have chosen as their prices are good and their product and warranty are better than the majority of the other competitors. The Tuk Tuk will be placed permanently in a  crowded location inside the city and will also be used for special events. An estimate of $500 will be used to decorate and upgrade the vehicle to load a grill and products within it. It will be enclosed in a wooden and steel frame.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527178076/vh9idapgrltjbgnapk4m.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Smaller 100cc motorcycles will travel the city carrying the cart with all its products and ready to prepare tacos on the go. The designated driver will also be the one who prepares the food.The motorcycles will also be  decorated to express the concept of the business.The motorcycles usually cost around <strong>$1200 </strong>with a 2 year warranty and theft insurance which is a necessary expense. The advantages of a motorcycle compared to a bicycle are countless.They can travel longer distances in a shorter space of time thus creating a better and faster city coverage.The business will start with 2 new motorcycles and eventually as demand grows, more will be purchased.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the expenses will happen immediately, like buying motorcycles and upgrading them to fit the needs of the business but others, like marketing and permits, will gradually be spent based on the necessity of the project.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact will surely be beyond expectations once the project gains momentum and popularity.The purpose will always go towards promoting veganism so we will be constantly adding more vegan products to add variety to to the business, thus creating a greater amount of customers. Eventually people  will realize  that going vegan is synonymous with being cool!</p>
<p>As I previously explained this is not just to ask for money but essentially the opportunity for you to join a movement with a purpose and commitment aimed to persuade an entire country to join the vegan movement and make a change for a better healthier life style. To put a footprint in a country by pioneering a radical fast food vegan concept that will eventually attract every single customer who takes advantage of it.</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Other ways you can help.</strong></p>
<p>You can contribute enormously by simply sharing the campaign with others and spreading the word out there! Any help we can receive from you will greatly aid us on the realization of this project.  A simple click can make a huge difference and Indiegogo provides the tools in order to succeed. Profound appreciation  for your valuable contribution, time and have a wonderful day!</p>

numerous CAT scans, X-rays, and pulmonary tests, all with no solution! I turned to a more
natural cure for my ailment after quickly realizing the extreme
benefits of juicing fruits and vegetables. Within 6
months of juicing, my cough was completely gone! At that point, I KNEW I wanted
to spread the benefits of juicing in any way I could.</p>

<b>What is KOR Juicing?</b><br/>
The high yield extraction of pure juice from fresh, raw, vegan fruits and
vegetables using latest in advanced juicing technology. Our juicing method
keeps vital enzymes, vitamins and nutrients in tact and ready to drink! Juicing
is extremely delicious and healthy and is often used for dietary reasons or a form of
alternative medicine.<p>
</p>
<p><b>We desperately need your help! </b><br/>We have spent the last 6 months
diligently: developing our new concept, researching juice recipes, studying the
specific health benefits of juicing, performing market research, creating
partnerships as well as gathering funding from juicers who are passionate about
our idea!</p>
<p>If you like our concept, our cause,
and want to truly spread health around the world, please read on and consider
pledging! <br/></p>

<p><b>What are Juicers saying about KOR?</b></p>
<p>“Great Concept! It really allows me
to put exactly what I want in my Juice” - April</p>
<p>“I am always a bit skeptical on what
exactly goes into my Juice at other Juice Bars, I like your idea of being able
to physically pick the fruits and veggies and hand it over to get juiced” - Jason</p>
<p>“Being able to test unlimited
recipes without having to go through all the trouble of buying it, washing it,
juicing it is great!” - Emily</p>
<p>“I love that you use ethnic fruits/
veggies! Other Juice Bars don’t really have that option” - Kevin</p>
<p>“When I go to some Juice Bars, I
always want to ‘mix and match’ a few recipes on their menu, but they won’t let
me!” - Dionne</p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><p><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

             ""The KOR of an Apple, the KOR of your Health, the KOR of a Cause""
Juicing changed my life! For 4
years, I was dealing with a chronic cough that seemed incurable. I met with
liver, lung, and ENT specialists, consulted with allergists, sat through
numerous CAT scans, X-rays, and pulmonary tests, all with no solution! I turned to a more
natural cure for my ailment after quickly realizing the extreme
benefits of juicing fruits and vegetables. Within 6
months of juicing, my cough was completely gone! At that point, I KNEW I wanted
to spread the benefits of juicing in any way I could.
This is where KOR Juice Bar comes in
to the picture. My team and I are avid cold-press juicers who want to bring an
entirely new idea to the world of juicing. We are seeking to be the very first juice bar
that allows you to ""Build Your Own"" juices at affordable prices. KOR's philosophy is to better the world by providing nutrition. We will donate 1 lb of produce to fight global malnutrition for every juice purchased!KOR SOCIAL IMPACT




Nearly 870 Million (1 of 8 people) are suffering from
chronic undernourishment. The number of hungry grew in Africa by 36% over the
past few years. 1 out of every 3 children in developing countries are affected
by Malnutrition. KOR wants collaborate with YOU to create a social impact!
What is KOR Juicing?
The high yield extraction of pure juice from fresh, raw, vegan fruits and
vegetables using latest in advanced juicing technology. Our juicing method
keeps vital enzymes, vitamins and nutrients in tact and ready to drink! Juicing
is extremely delicious and healthy and is often used for dietary reasons or a form of
alternative medicine.

We desperately need your help! We have spent the last 6 months
diligently: developing our new concept, researching juice recipes, studying the
specific health benefits of juicing, performing market research, creating
partnerships as well as gathering funding from juicers who are passionate about
our idea!
If you like our concept, our cause,
and want to truly spread health around the world, please read on and consider
pledging! 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE ""KOR"" CONCEPT
 3 ways we are different!







  

1. ""BUILD IT YOURSELF""/
CUSTOMIZED JUICES - Build your
own juice the way you like it with our “Unlimited Menu” 

From apples to kale to dragon fruit, you pick the ingredients and we do the
rest! Customize your juice to your heart’s
content with our large selection of produce and ethnic fruits you just won’t
find at other juice bars. 
While the KOR recipe wall is used to give you inspiration, you are the ultimate
decision maker when it comes to customizing your juice! We will label each recipe on our recipe wall with the expected color
and health benefits. 


               


                                                           







2.
CUSTOMIZED CLEANSES - Everyone
has a different motivation to cleanse! 
We will offer 1/2/3 day cleanses based on the desired health benefit that suits
you! Each day's cleanse consists of 6 different 16oz juices made from a total
of 15 lbs of fruit and veggies! You tell us what you need, we'll do the research and create a specialized cleanse just for you!
                  

3. AFFORDABLE PRICING - KOR juices are 30% cheaper than average juice
bars through savings from our ""Build It Yourself"" model! 
In the mood for a hearty fresh juice? Only want a small serving to kick off
your day? No problem! KOR juices are competitively priced based on the weight
of produce you desire!
                                                                 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE ""KOR"" PROCESS

STEP 1: RECIPE STATION
Get juice recipe inspiration from the KOR Recipe Wall. Our recipe wall will
display 30 different juice recipes showing the expected juice colors and health
benefits!
STEP 2: PRODUCE STATION
Grab a basket and pick up fresh, raw, vegan produce based upon our recipes or
get creative and customize your very own juice!
STEP 3: JUICING STATION 
Put your produce on the scale as we charge by the pound. And then watch as we
juice your fresh, raw, vegan produce into a delicious healthy beverage for you
to enjoy!                    

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Without you, there is no KOR!

We need your help!
As much as we want to revolutionize
the juicing industry, we are at a point in which we cannot do it without your support! We are passionate about juicing, our new concept,
and the benefits we can bring to the community!
We have invested much time and
effort into a model we feel will revolutionize the juicing industry, but at
this point we are in need of $40G to finish our project to spread
the KOR benefit! $20G we hope to raise from this campaign, the other $20G will be funded by juicers who believe in our idea and are willing to invest in KOR! We hope that through your generous pledges, we can spread the KOR benefits worldwide.
The KOR of our vision is to revolutionize the world of juicing and to fight malnutrition by finding creative ways to provide healthy living!

What is your KOR? 
Support us also by answering this question on social media:Facebook.com/KORjuice Twitter.com/KORjuiceKORjuice.com
Pledges
What will Pledges be used for?
We will open our very first juice
bar in Southern California (Orange County or Los Angeles) with plans to expand
to target where our customers want us? Please send us feedback on desired
locations!


What are Juicers saying about KOR?
“Great Concept! It really allows me
to put exactly what I want in my Juice” - April
“I am always a bit skeptical on what
exactly goes into my Juice at other Juice Bars, I like your idea of being able
to physically pick the fruits and veggies and hand it over to get juiced” - Jason
“Being able to test unlimited
recipes without having to go through all the trouble of buying it, washing it,
juicing it is great!” - Emily
“I love that you use ethnic fruits/
veggies! Other Juice Bars don’t really have that option” - Kevin
“When I go to some Juice Bars, I
always want to ‘mix and match’ a few recipes on their menu, but they won’t let
me!” - Dionne

<h3><font>Our Story: </font></h3>
<p>After working long hours at jobs that were unfulfilling and draining we sold all of our things, packed up what was left in their car, and moved across the country. After leaving the old jobs that we hated so much, we made a promise to each other that we would never work regular office jobs again, and tasked ourselves with creating our own business. From there Nouveau Quiche was born. </p>
<p>At Nouveau Quiche, we’ve spent a lot of time in the kitchen, reimagining &amp; developing the perfect quiche. Inside ours, you’ll find only the best farm-fresh ingredients, prepared in unique &amp; creative ways.</p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>After 3 years of serving our quiche in Farmers Markets throughout Arizona, we're ready to grow our business and participate in larger events throughout the nation as well as make our quiche accessible to everyone through online sales - <i><strong>that's why we're asking for your help! </strong></i></span></p>

</div></div>","Our Story: 
After working long hours at jobs that were unfulfilling and draining we sold all of our things, packed up what was left in their car, and moved across the country. After leaving the old jobs that we hated so much, we made a promise to each other that we would never work regular office jobs again, and tasked ourselves with creating our own business. From there Nouveau Quiche was born. 
At Nouveau Quiche, we’ve spent a lot of time in the kitchen, reimagining & developing the perfect quiche. Inside ours, you’ll find only the best farm-fresh ingredients, prepared in unique & creative ways.
After 3 years of serving our quiche in Farmers Markets throughout Arizona, we're ready to grow our business and participate in larger events throughout the nation as well as make our quiche accessible to everyone through online sales - that's why we're asking for your help! 

What We Need & What You Get

We have the opportunity grow our business in new and exciting ways, and we can't do it without your help! 
First, we have the once in a lifetime chance to purchase a 1958 Citroen truck that's as unique as our quiche, with an expandable hood and plenty of storage space for larger events. This truck is 1 of 3 in the world (the other 2 are in museums in France), and will give us opportunities to:

Participate in larger events throughout the nation
Serve more people than ever before

​​We are also ready to expand into online sales, but we need help raising the capital to get started. We want to make sure that our loyal customers nationwide can get our quiche for all of their favorite holidays and traditions, or any time of the year!

We need $32,000 to purchase the 1958 Citroen food truck and start selling online. As a big thank you for your support, we've created a variety of donation levels, all designed to help you fall in love with quiche:
Donation Levels
$25 Donation: Utensil Kit with Carabiner
$30 Donation: Limited Edition Artist Designed Nouveau Quiche T-shirt
$50 Donation: Whole 12"" Quiche
$100 Donation: Brunch in a Box 4 People (Includes Quiche & Vinaigrette for Salad for 4)
$150 Donation: Brunch in a Box for 8 People (Includes Quiche & Vinaigrette for Salad for 8)

Some of our reviews: 
""Armand’s quiches are the undeniable proof that God exists and that He adores us. Complete and absolute gustative ecstasy! ""
""This quiche is awesome. I'm not sure how they make it so addictive and melt-in-your-mouth incredible, but they do. Maybe it's the honey drizzle, maybe it's the crumb topping, maybe it's the buttery, flaky crust. All I know is this quiche is the bomb. My teenager that normally wouldn't touch quiche literally hides pieces in the fridge. Thank you for making me fall in love again with quiche. ""
""I'm obsessed! Best quiche ever. BEWARE, it's addicting ?""
""The CRUST! Holy hell...the CRUST!!! I’ve baked for years, and my mother has produced video how-to’s about pie. But this CRUST is the best I’ve ever had. Never mind the perfect blend of ingredients inside, I’ve been LITERALLY licking my plate when I’m “done”.""

Specifically coffee shops around the world. After years of seeing the world and experiencing different cultures. We know there's nothing like the feeling of waking up in a new place, eager to wander out your door and try a local coffee shop. The immersion you experience while drinking coffee on a trip is something you take with you when you return home, even if you can't take the coffee itself.

<p><strong>We are the family from Lithuania, living in Spain.</strong></p>
<p><i> Gguni Dates Cacao es el pequeño obrador familiar del chocolate Bean To Bar (desde el grano hasta la tabla) y vegano, menos procesado y endulzado naturalmente con dátiles (u otros frutos). </i></p>
<p><i>Nosotros somos una familia de Lituania, viviendo en España.</i></p>
<p> Gguni dates cacao, tai mažas šeimyninis bean to bar (nuo pupelės iki plytelės) veganiško, datulėmis (ar kitais vaisiais) saldinto mažiau apdirbto šokolado fabrikėlis.</p>
<p> Mes esame Ispanijoje gyvenanti lietuvių šeima.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615579812/ppyn2pusyf7afsne60ou.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>OUR CORE IDEA </h3>
<h3><i>NUESTRA IDEA PRINCIPAL </i></h3>
<h3>PAGRINDINĖ MŪSŲ IDĖJA</h3>
<p><strong> Living in a nowadays world with a well developed food industry we were shocked to realize to how much refined sugar and artificial additives in food our children and we are exposed! So having a dream to get our children and us eating more natural foods full of nutrients without artificial additives nor refined sugars added we came to the idea, that we need to make naturally sweetened chocolate ourselves, as to find one in stores seemed impossible. That  was the first push. </strong></p>
<p><i> Viviendo en un mundo actual con una industria alimentaria bien desarrollada, nos sorprendió en el sentido negativo cuando hemos dado cuenta de la cantidad del azúcar refinada y aditivos artificiales a que están expuestos nuestros hijos y nosotros. Entonces, teniendo el sueño de que nuestros hijos y nosotros comiéramos alimentos más naturales y llenos de nutrientes sin aditivos artificiales ni azúcares refinados añadidos, se nos ocurrió la idea de que necesitamos hacer chocolate endulzado naturalmente nosotros mismos, ya que encontrar uno en las tiendas parecía impossible.  Ese fue el primer empujón.</i></p>
<p> Gyvendami gerai išvystytos maisto pramonės pasaulyje buvome sukrėsti supratę su kiek daug rafinuoto cukraus ir dirbtinių priedų maiste kasdien susiduria mūsų vaikai ir mes! Taigi, norėdami maitintis natūralesniu maistingu maistu be dirbtinių priedų bei rafinuoto pridėtinio cukraus, nusprendėme, jog patys turime gaminti natūraliai saldintą šokoladą, kadangi tokio surasti parduotuvių lentynose mums nepavyko. Tai buvo pirmas motyvas.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615579898/hpctm3chaztbpc8dt5dd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong> The second motivation was to get more nutricional value from cacao, which most chocolates in stores do not have anymore, as are made from alcalized cacao mass and are too much processed. The studies show, that alcalized cacao loses 60% of antioxidants compeared to a non alcalized cacao. </strong></p>
<p><i> La segunda motivación fue obtener más valor nutricional del cacao, cual la mayoría de los chocolates en las tiendas ya no tienen, ya que están hechos de la masa de cacao alcalinizado y están demasiado procesados.  Los estudios muestran que el cacao alcalinizado pierde el 60% de antioxidantes en comparación con un cacao no alcalinizado.</i></p>
<p> Antroji motyvacija buvo noras iš kakavos pupelių išgauti daugiau maistinės vertės, kurios dauguma šokoladų parduotuvių lentynose nebeturi tiek daug. Nes dažniausiai yra gaminami iš alkalizuotos kakavos masės ir yra stipriai apdirbami. Tyrimai rodo, kad alkalizuota kakava praranda 60% antioksidantų lyginant ją su nealkalizuota kakava.</p> <p><strong> The third push was our milk intolerant olderst daughter and some our milk and nuts alergic friends, who could not enjoy chocolate without a risk of suffering consequences as most of the chocolates in stores have possible traces of milk and nuts. We decided that we can make the chocolate suitable for them! </strong></p>
<p><i> El tercer empujón fue nuestra hija mayor  con intolerancia a la leche y algunos de nuestros amigos alérgicos a la leche y a los frutos secos, que no podían disfrutar el chocolate sin correr el riesgo de sufrir consecuencias ya que la mayoría de los chocolates en las tiendas tienen posibles trazas de leche y frutos secos.  ¡Decidimos que podemos hacer que el chocolate sea adecuado para ellos!</i></p>
<p>  Trečia paspirtis buvo pienui netoleranciją turinti vyriausioji dukra bei pienui ir riešutams alergiški mūsų draugai, kurie dažniausiai negali mėgautis šokoladu nerizikuodami patirti nemalonių pasekmių, kadangi dauguma šokoladų turi galimų pieno ar riešutų likučių. Nusprendėme, kad galime pagaminti jiems tinkamą šokoladą!</p> <p><strong> So our core idea and core value is to make a Bean To Bar Chocolate from the selected tasty beans, </strong></p>
<p><i> Entonces nuestra idea principal  y nuestro valor principal es hacer el chocolate Bean To Bar desde granos seleccionados y sabrosos,</i></p>
<p> Taigi, pagrindinė mūsų idėja ir pagrindinės vertybės yra: gaminti bean to bar (nuo pupelės iki plytelės) šokoladą iš atrinktų skanių kakavos pupelių,</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615580024/byzmju62lovmhfym3khl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong> sweetening it purely with dates or other fruits full of nutrients them selves</strong></p>
<p><i> endulzarlo solo con dátiles u otros frutos, llenos de nutrientes</i></p>
<p> saldinti jį datulėmis ar kitais maistingais vaisiai,</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615580063/eomjplrvviesvhn2skh9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong> and make it little processed to preserve all the best nutrients cacao beans have.</strong></p>
<p><i> y hacerlo menos procesado para preservar los propiedades nutricionales de los granos de cacao.</i></p>
<p> mažai jį apdirbti, kad išsaugotume kakavos pupelių maistingumą.</p> <p><strong> As the additional ingredientes we use only natural non alergic ones: vanila bean, fresh orange peel, sticks of Ceylon cinnamon, mint leaves, dried fruit purees which add their nutritional value to the chocolate aswell.</strong></p>
<p><strong>So all the ingredients of our chocolates are nutritionaly highly valuable. </strong></p>
<p><i> Como ingredientes adicionales usamos solo cosas reales no alergicas: vaina de vainilla, piel de naranja fresca, canela de Ceylan, hojas de menta, purés secados de frutas que añaden su valor nutricional al chocolate tambien. </i></p>
<p><i>Entonces, todos los ingredientes de nuestros chocolates llevan valor nutricional alta.</i></p>
<p> Kaip papildomas sudedamąsias dalis naudojame tik realius, natūralius, nealergizuojančius produktus: vanilės ankštis, šviežių apelsinų žieveles, Ceilono cinamoną, mėtos lapelius, džiovintas vaisių juosteles, kurie šokoladui papildomai suteikia ir savo maistinę vertę.</p>
<p>Taigi, visos mūsų šokoladų sudedamosios dalys turi aukštą maistinę vertę.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615580116/u9e19ygglzzp8qk4zlsz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong> We chose plastic free paper packaging to preserve our planet as this matters to us a lot too.</strong></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong> We have started our production with a very basic  equipment (you can see in the video below), which requires a lot of hand work and makes the making process very slow and hard. </strong></p>
<p><i> Hemos empezado nuestra producción con un equipamiento muy básico (lo puede ver en el video abajo), lo que requiere mucho trabajo manual y hace que el proceso de fabricación sea muy lento y duro. </i></p>

We are the family from Lithuania, living in Spain.
 Gguni Dates Cacao es el pequeño obrador familiar del chocolate Bean To Bar (desde el grano hasta la tabla) y vegano, menos procesado y endulzado naturalmente con dátiles (u otros frutos). 
Nosotros somos una familia de Lituania, viviendo en España.
 Gguni dates cacao, tai mažas šeimyninis bean to bar (nuo pupelės iki plytelės) veganiško, datulėmis (ar kitais vaisiais) saldinto mažiau apdirbto šokolado fabrikėlis.
 Mes esame Ispanijoje gyvenanti lietuvių šeima.


OUR CORE IDEA 
NUESTRA IDEA PRINCIPAL 
PAGRINDINĖ MŪSŲ IDĖJA
 Living in a nowadays world with a well developed food industry we were shocked to realize to how much refined sugar and artificial additives in food our children and we are exposed! So having a dream to get our children and us eating more natural foods full of nutrients without artificial additives nor refined sugars added we came to the idea, that we need to make naturally sweetened chocolate ourselves, as to find one in stores seemed impossible. That  was the first push. 
 Viviendo en un mundo actual con una industria alimentaria bien desarrollada, nos sorprendió en el sentido negativo cuando hemos dado cuenta de la cantidad del azúcar refinada y aditivos artificiales a que están expuestos nuestros hijos y nosotros. Entonces, teniendo el sueño de que nuestros hijos y nosotros comiéramos alimentos más naturales y llenos de nutrientes sin aditivos artificiales ni azúcares refinados añadidos, se nos ocurrió la idea de que necesitamos hacer chocolate endulzado naturalmente nosotros mismos, ya que encontrar uno en las tiendas parecía impossible.  Ese fue el primer empujón.
 Gyvendami gerai išvystytos maisto pramonės pasaulyje buvome sukrėsti supratę su kiek daug rafinuoto cukraus ir dirbtinių priedų maiste kasdien susiduria mūsų vaikai ir mes! Taigi, norėdami maitintis natūralesniu maistingu maistu be dirbtinių priedų bei rafinuoto pridėtinio cukraus, nusprendėme, jog patys turime gaminti natūraliai saldintą šokoladą, kadangi tokio surasti parduotuvių lentynose mums nepavyko. Tai buvo pirmas motyvas.

 The second motivation was to get more nutricional value from cacao, which most chocolates in stores do not have anymore, as are made from alcalized cacao mass and are too much processed. The studies show, that alcalized cacao loses 60% of antioxidants compeared to a non alcalized cacao. 
 La segunda motivación fue obtener más valor nutricional del cacao, cual la mayoría de los chocolates en las tiendas ya no tienen, ya que están hechos de la masa de cacao alcalinizado y están demasiado procesados.  Los estudios muestran que el cacao alcalinizado pierde el 60% de antioxidantes en comparación con un cacao no alcalinizado.
 Antroji motyvacija buvo noras iš kakavos pupelių išgauti daugiau maistinės vertės, kurios dauguma šokoladų parduotuvių lentynose nebeturi tiek daug. Nes dažniausiai yra gaminami iš alkalizuotos kakavos masės ir yra stipriai apdirbami. Tyrimai rodo, kad alkalizuota kakava praranda 60% antioksidantų lyginant ją su nealkalizuota kakava.  The third push was our milk intolerant olderst daughter and some our milk and nuts alergic friends, who could not enjoy chocolate without a risk of suffering consequences as most of the chocolates in stores have possible traces of milk and nuts. We decided that we can make the chocolate suitable for them! 
 El tercer empujón fue nuestra hija mayor  con intolerancia a la leche y algunos de nuestros amigos alérgicos a la leche y a los frutos secos, que no podían disfrutar el chocolate sin correr el riesgo de sufrir consecuencias ya que la mayoría de los chocolates en las tiendas tienen posibles trazas de leche y frutos secos.  ¡Decidimos que podemos hacer que el chocolate sea adecuado para ellos!
  Trečia paspirtis buvo pienui netoleranciją turinti vyriausioji dukra bei pienui ir riešutams alergiški mūsų draugai, kurie dažniausiai negali mėgautis šokoladu nerizikuodami patirti nemalonių pasekmių, kadangi dauguma šokoladų turi galimų pieno ar riešutų likučių. Nusprendėme, kad galime pagaminti jiems tinkamą šokoladą!  So our core idea and core value is to make a Bean To Bar Chocolate from the selected tasty beans, 
 Entonces nuestra idea principal  y nuestro valor principal es hacer el chocolate Bean To Bar desde granos seleccionados y sabrosos,
 Taigi, pagrindinė mūsų idėja ir pagrindinės vertybės yra: gaminti bean to bar (nuo pupelės iki plytelės) šokoladą iš atrinktų skanių kakavos pupelių,

 sweetening it purely with dates or other fruits full of nutrients them selves
 endulzarlo solo con dátiles u otros frutos, llenos de nutrientes
 saldinti jį datulėmis ar kitais maistingais vaisiai,

 and make it little processed to preserve all the best nutrients cacao beans have.
 y hacerlo menos procesado para preservar los propiedades nutricionales de los granos de cacao.
 mažai jį apdirbti, kad išsaugotume kakavos pupelių maistingumą.  As the additional ingredientes we use only natural non alergic ones: vanila bean, fresh orange peel, sticks of Ceylon cinnamon, mint leaves, dried fruit purees which add their nutritional value to the chocolate aswell.
So all the ingredients of our chocolates are nutritionaly highly valuable. 
 Como ingredientes adicionales usamos solo cosas reales no alergicas: vaina de vainilla, piel de naranja fresca, canela de Ceylan, hojas de menta, purés secados de frutas que añaden su valor nutricional al chocolate tambien. 
Entonces, todos los ingredientes de nuestros chocolates llevan valor nutricional alta.
 Kaip papildomas sudedamąsias dalis naudojame tik realius, natūralius, nealergizuojančius produktus: vanilės ankštis, šviežių apelsinų žieveles, Ceilono cinamoną, mėtos lapelius, džiovintas vaisių juosteles, kurie šokoladui papildomai suteikia ir savo maistinę vertę.
Taigi, visos mūsų šokoladų sudedamosios dalys turi aukštą maistinę vertę.

 We chose plastic free paper packaging to preserve our planet as this matters to us a lot too.
 Usamos los envases de papel solo, sin plastico ni aluminio, para preservar nuestra planeta, porque eso importa a nosotros tambien.
 Mūsų pakuotės popierinės, be plastiko ir be aliuminio, kadangi mums labai rūpi ir mūsų planeta. OUR LITTLE FACTORY

What We Need & What You Get
 We have started our production with a very basic  equipment (you can see in the video below), which requires a lot of hand work and makes the making process very slow and hard. 
 Hemos empezado nuestra producción con un equipamiento muy básico (lo puede ver en el video abajo), lo que requiere mucho trabajo manual y hace que el proceso de fabricación sea muy lento y duro. 
 Atidarėme mūsų šokolado fabrikėlį turėdami labai paprastą įrangą (galite pamatyti filmuke apačioje), su kuria gamyba vyksta labai lėtai ir reikalauja daug ir sunkaus rankų darbo.

 So now to continue and to ensure the existance of the factory and to give the posibility for more people to get our healthier chocolates, we need some more eficient equipment (bigger oven, more efficient winnower, ball mill, bigger fridge, etc.), which are expensive enough for us not to efford them. 
 Así que ahora para seguir y asegurar la existencia del obrador y dar la posibilidad a más gente a conseguir nuestros chocolates saludables, necesitamos equipamientos más eficaz (horno más grande, el winnower (descascaroador) más eficaz, molino de bolas, la nevera más grande y etc.), que son para nosotros bastante caros para poder permitirlosnos. 
  Norėdami užtikrinti tolimesnį fabrikėlio egzistavumą bei pasiekti, kad mūsų šokoladas būtų prieinamas didesniam žmonių ratui, mums būtina įsigyti našesnę įrangą (didesnę krosnį, našesnį pupelių nužievintoją, rutulinį malūną, didesnį šaldytuvą ir t.t.), tačiau jie yra pakankamai brangūs, kad galėtume juos įpirkti.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to browse through the details of our campaign.</p>
<p>Our family loves to spend time together on the water. Whether we’re enjoying time on one of the many lakes in our home state of Minnesota, relaxing in a pool, or spending time on the river, we love to be near water. Over the years, we began to notice a common problem - our beverages were always out of reach! While we were in the water, our beverages were on the beach, boat, or side of the pool. We loved having our insulated cup to keep our beverages cold, but we did not like having to hold it the entire time. We realized there had to be a better solution.</p>
<p>How could we enjoy time in the water with a cold beverage within reach? This question sparked brainstorming sessions that continued around our dinner table until the <strong>Buoya Floating Tumbler</strong> idea was born.</p>
<p>Our research, design, and development were a family affair. We tried numerous tumblers from various manufacturers, but nothing worked like we desired. Many hours, days, and weekends were spent testing a variety of ideas and prototypes. Like this:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1611461988/kb1twehm7sfeyqolxbow.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We started with a simple homemade cup full of washers for weight in our bathtub and graduated to prototypes from our manufacturer.</p>
<p>Buoya has come a long way.</p>
<p>The Buoya Floating Tumbler holds 12 ounces of liquid and measures 3 inches wide by 8 inches tall, large enough to hold your favorite drink, but compact enough to fit in a standard cup holder. Its stainless steel double-wall vacuum-insulated construction keeps your drink cold - or hot! <strong>The Buoya Founder's Edition is white powder-coated stainless steel with a black water-tight lid.</strong></p>
<p>The launch of the <strong>Buoya Floating Tumbler</strong> is especially meaningful for us, because it showcases to our children that a simple idea can turn into something great with hard work and determination. We're sure that you will also love and enjoy our <strong>Buoya Floating Tumbler</strong> for years to come.</p>

</div></div>","Our Story
Thank you so much for taking the time to browse through the details of our campaign.
Our family loves to spend time together on the water. Whether we’re enjoying time on one of the many lakes in our home state of Minnesota, relaxing in a pool, or spending time on the river, we love to be near water. Over the years, we began to notice a common problem - our beverages were always out of reach! While we were in the water, our beverages were on the beach, boat, or side of the pool. We loved having our insulated cup to keep our beverages cold, but we did not like having to hold it the entire time. We realized there had to be a better solution.
How could we enjoy time in the water with a cold beverage within reach? This question sparked brainstorming sessions that continued around our dinner table until the Buoya Floating Tumbler idea was born.
Our research, design, and development were a family affair. We tried numerous tumblers from various manufacturers, but nothing worked like we desired. Many hours, days, and weekends were spent testing a variety of ideas and prototypes. Like this:

We started with a simple homemade cup full of washers for weight in our bathtub and graduated to prototypes from our manufacturer.
Buoya has come a long way.
The Buoya Floating Tumbler holds 12 ounces of liquid and measures 3 inches wide by 8 inches tall, large enough to hold your favorite drink, but compact enough to fit in a standard cup holder. Its stainless steel double-wall vacuum-insulated construction keeps your drink cold - or hot! The Buoya Founder's Edition is white powder-coated stainless steel with a black water-tight lid.
The launch of the Buoya Floating Tumbler is especially meaningful for us, because it showcases to our children that a simple idea can turn into something great with hard work and determination. We're sure that you will also love and enjoy our Buoya Floating Tumbler for years to come.
Cheers,Mark & Dani Harms

<p><strong>Hi, my name is Anton, I live in Ukraine. </strong>More than a year, my girl-friend and I are engaged in food (edible) bouquets and homemade cakes. Yes, you won't believe, exactly food bouquets. These are food compositions, or a mix of flowers and food.</p>
<p><i>Food bouquet :</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563988614/n0z0cfe2nu34wy83eubf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>For half a year we have had one idea that we call a dream. We want to create a free showroom in which there will be a floristic store, as well as a platform where anyone can collect a bouquet for a gift to a loved one from our products or brought from the store. Of course, all this can be done under the supervision of our florists.</p>

<p>The idea to start making such bouquets, came to us for a reason. The thing is that more than a year ago we decided to benefit the children who stayed in the local hospital. Since we did not have savings for the purchase of expensive drugs, all the benefits we could bring were entertainment and handicrafts. That would help the children to forget about the pain and at least somehow distract them from where they are! Having bought in the store all the healthy fruits, as well as sweets, we decided to present them in an unusual form, in the form of bouquets! Since we have collected ordinary bouquets a couple of times before and had experience in this business, it was not difficult for us to hold a bouquet class right at the hospital with the children! And it was so amazing that we decided not to stop and continue. A week later, we did the same master class in an orphanage for children who were left without parental care! After that, we started to make food bouquets and homemade pastries for sale.</p>

<h3>Concept of the institution &amp; Financial plan</h3>
<p>But since the profit from the bouquets went to charity master classes and gifts for the hospital, we had to continue working at the main job in order to somehow secure our accommodation. It is very difficult, both physically and emotionally, as sometimes there were days when we slept only a couple of hours.</p>
<p>We understand that we need to move on, and in order to continue to engage in charity work, we need to be completely immersed in the activity we love. For us, it is floristry and baking. It so happened that it is very difficult to create a business in our country. There are many nuances, including financial ones. It is difficult to get a loan, and if any luck, the amounts are much less than we need. We also do not have enough personal funds to start, since we spend almost everything that we earn on charity master classes and gifts for children.</p>
<p><strong>After carried out calculations, we are at the stage of planning and design. </strong></p>

Since we are far from our potential investors (although we will be very happy to see any of you in our country, and do everything for you to stay with us), all that we can offer as gifts is a video course (lessons) of master classes on the assembly of food bouquets of various configurations. The course was planned in Ukrainian, but we plan to release a separate course in English especially for you! The estimated release date for the lessons is the end of September 2019.</p>

<p>We also invite you to participate in our charity events! In the near future there will be two of them. This will be a visit to the children's unit in the hospital, where stay children with oncology.

We will hold the second master class in one of the orphanages, where children are deprived of parental care. In addition, we will buy toys and the necessary equipment for the sports development of children.</p>
<p>All charity master classes registers will be nominal. The name of each person who will take part in charity will be published on our banner.

<h3>Why Should You Support This?</h3>
<p>If you haven't yet watched the ""dining out -redefined"" video, above, please take four minutes to watch it and discover how much better your dining out experience could be.</p>
<p>But it isn't just about you. By supporting the development of the <b>eatster<sup>tm</sup></b> app, you will also be helping millions of other people. Watch the ""Help Annie"" and/or ""Help Dennis"" videos, above. There are currently over 3.5 million people in the U.S. on the autism spectrum; approximately 3.3 million people affected by social anxiety disorder; and approximately 1 million people in the U.S. who are deaf. The <b>eatster<sup>tm</sup></b> app will make the experience of going out for a meal a possibility for between four and five million of these people.</p>
<table border=""1"" cellpadding=""20"" cellspacing=""0""><tbody><tr><td>
<p><b>If You Own or Manage a Restaurant:</b><br/>You know that some restaurants (e.g., Taco Bell and Starbucks) already have apps. Others (e.g., McDonald's and Panera) are developing their own apps. You know you would benefit from the lower labor cost and increased customer satisfaction that will come with having an app. Watch the <b>eatster<sup>tm</sup></b> demo for restaurants video (above, blue background).</p>
<p>You may remember a time when people had three or four gas company credit cards and possibly three or four department store credit cards. How many of those do you have in your wallet now? The <b>eatster<sup>tm</sup></b> app is the Visa of restaurant apps.</p>

<center><b><i>""We need money"" - Capt. Obvious</i></b></center>
<p>Money raised through this campaign will be used to cover the expenses of development, testing and marketing. See the table below for a detailed break out of the expenses to be covered.</p>
<p><b>But we need something more than money!</b><br/>We need your support to show the restaruants that they should use the app. The way to support the app is to become a backer. If you don't want to buy a perk, we're perfectly cool with that. But to become a backer, please at least click on the BACK IT button and chip in a dollar. That way you will be in the database so we can keep you up to date.</p>
<p>If we sell 15,000 buttons we will make our goal, but if we only raise $20,000 from 20,000 backers at $1 each, that will be enough to start the programming. And 20,000 backers will be enough to attract investors to make up the balance of the budget.</p>
<p><b>How often do you get a chance to make history for only $1?</b></p>
<p>Of course, if you want a souveneir, feel free to buy a perk. Shipping within the U.S. is included for all perks.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>          Veggie Hut is a vegan food truck serving custom burgers, dogs and sides in Orange County California. Having been vegan together for seven years, Michael and Georgina have made many delicious plant based meals together over the years. Michael with over 20 years of culinary work experience and Georgina a foodie with a culinary arts degree have come together to create an amazing menu. Veggie Hut's menu places vegan versions of some of our favorite junk food from various fast food chains under one portable roof, a food truck. Just take a look at VeggieHut OC on instagram to get an idea of what we will be offering.</p>
<p>          We are on Indiegogo funding our food truck and we are trying to get people to donate $1 each. Of course you could donate more if you would like, and it would be appreciated, but we feel pretty much everyone could spare a $1! Just a buck! Instead of offering different prizes to people depending on how much they contribute we would like to take this approach, just donate $1, tell your friends, and hopefully they will tell about 30,000 more. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>           Veggie Hut is seeking $30,000 for startup cost. We will be purchasing a used food truck, additional kitchen equipment, a decorative wrap, pos system, insurance, commissary deposit and initial food inventory.</p>
<p>           The truck itself will be the most costly part, depending on the quality of equipment on the truck (if any) and the condition of the truck (running vs not running). We have found used trucks from $5,000 that would need some TLC, up to $15,000 or $20,000 that would contain everything we need.</p>
<p>           Wraps for the trucks range from $3000 to $5000. Wraps replace custom paint jobs.</p>
<p>           An initial $3000 to $4000 would be needed to purchase kitchen supplies. This will cover everything from serving utensils to hamburger buns, at least for the first month.</p>
<p>           Any funds left over at this point will go towards the pos system, insurance, commissary deposit and some of the unexpected cost that we are sure to encounter.</p>
<p>           What you will get from Veggie Hut is delicious vegan food. The customer will be receiving a quality product that is full of flavor, affordable and satisfying. Veggie Hut's menu items will be prepared by a chef with over twenty years in the business who knows how to prepare food properly, safely and consistently. At Veggie Hut, Michael and Georgina look forward to satisfying customers with amazing food done right.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>            As vegans, Michael and Georgina find more and more dining options available to them with each passing year. Yet they still notice items or meals that in order to have, must be made at home. With a love for food and cooking, and wanting to share food with others, they created Veggie Hut. Veggie Hut will be a place a vegan and meat eater can both go eat, enjoy their meals, be full and not feel that one person had to compromise or suffer through a meal for the other. We will be providing plant based meals for not only vegans and vegetarians, but for those who may need to greatly reduce animal intake for medical reasons.</p>
<p>           Being in Orange County we have noticed that almost all of the vegan restaurants are found in the same concentrated area, with little to no options in South Orange County. We would like to change this by focusing on South Orange County and be located close to the coast. We would be your vegan 'Cajun' burger after the beach or an order of fried zucchini with homemade ranch after cycling up and down P.C.H. The combination of vegans, vegetarians and all around health conscious folks in Orange County, especially near Beach Cities, will allow Veggie Hut to provide a very positive impact on the community.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>            We are expecting a lot of work, long days and lots of learning experiences as we, Veggie Hut, learn the in's and out's of owning and operating a food truck. Michael, with his exstensive culinary background has helped to open restaurants, create menus, develop recipes, plan special events, catered parties and worked many many hours on kitchen lines to be as prepared as he can be to manage the kitchen at Veggie Hut. </p>
<p>             There is always the risk that another vegan restaurant could have the same idea and open a store or food truck close to Veggie Hut. There could be a well established restaurant looking to expand, or a brand new place with a similar menu. This is always a possibility, but we are confident that Veggie Hut's menu and recipes will make us stand out.</p>

<p>The base is a solid piece of food-grade stainless steel, which makes the Smash Axe robust, corrosion resistant, and extremely easy to clean.  Measuring 5 inches in diameter and 1/4 inch thick, the circular base is large enough to efficiently tackle any job while still being easy to control.  At 2.88 lbs, the Smash Axe has enough mass to handle bigger jobs without tiring you out.  Let the weight do the work!</p>

<h3>Who?</h3>
<p>My name is Laura. I am a young French entrepreneur living in Asia. In 2017, I launched Le Petit Croissant, a breakfast delivery service offering the best French brunches at home and delicious breakfasts for your office meetings. Le Petit Croissant operates both in Hong Kong and Singapore. We have already delivered to hundreds of prestigious companies and thousands of families at home who are loving our pastries, our breads and all of our other French items.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why this project?</h3>
<p>Until today, we've been a delivery-only business as we were baking from our central kitchen with no visibility and no possibility for self pick-up. I am finally opening our first takeaway shop where you will be able to collect your bread and pastries from!</p>
<p>With this new kitchen I will finally be able to meet you in person when you collect your orders. We will also launch same-day deliveries and we will be able to organize bread workshops for small groups of people. </p>
<p>All those aspects seem like a natural way to grow Le Petit Croissant and its community.</p>
<h3>What We Need: </h3>
<p>I need help raising funds to do the renovation works of the kitchen so that it will become a beautiful space to work in, learn and be inspired! I want the local community to be able to find a great bakery where they can come to have some delicious bread and coffee, learn in day courses and join events with other bakers and foodies!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where?</h3>
<p>After long hours of research and dozens of shop visits, I found the perfect kitchen space for Le Petit Croissant. It is located at 338 Changi Road in Singapore. It’s a very convenient location on ground floor, which is perfect for deliveries and self pick-up. The space is bright and beautiful. When I saw it I knew it would be perfect for Le Petit Croissant ? The tenancy agreement is already signed and the lease will start in October 2020.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How can you help?</h3>
<p>If you live in Singapore you can pre-book your brunch, your bread or your bread workshop with us! If you are outside of Singapore, we also have great rewards as you can follow our bread courses online. You can also get our cute embroidered t-shirt delivered to you anywhere in the world.</p>

<p><strong>RESUMEN</strong></p>
<p>Todo este proyecto tiene una base emocional y una racional.</p>
<p>Es <strong>el sueño de un crío </strong>de padre español y madre sudafricana que cuando era pequeñito iba a visitar regularmente a su familía en Sudáfrica y al volver traía consigo el producto típico nacional de ahí, el biltong, para compartirlo con sus amigos y familiares españoles. Tal era el éxito que, con sólo 10 añitos y enamorado del producto, <strong>se prometió que un día lo comercializaría en Europa </strong>porque lo bueno, hay que compartirlo.</p>
<p>Tras años de experiencia laboral y un MBA se decidió que había llegado el momento y <strong>en 2014 fundó African Tastes</strong> con el objetivo de fusionar conceptos sudafricanos con alimentos de aquí y de esta manera innovar <i>Aportando Salud a la Sociedad</i>.</p>

Todo este proyecto tiene una base emocional y una racional.
Es el sueño de un crío de padre español y madre sudafricana que cuando era pequeñito iba a visitar regularmente a su familía en Sudáfrica y al volver traía consigo el producto típico nacional de ahí, el biltong, para compartirlo con sus amigos y familiares españoles. Tal era el éxito que, con sólo 10 añitos y enamorado del producto, se prometió que un día lo comercializaría en Europa porque lo bueno, hay que compartirlo.
Tras años de experiencia laboral y un MBA se decidió que había llegado el momento y en 2014 fundó African Tastes con el objetivo de fusionar conceptos sudafricanos con alimentos de aquí y de esta manera innovar Aportando Salud a la Sociedad.

La base racional es el crecimiento constante de la categoría de snacks. Cada vez tenemos menos tiempo para pararnos a comer y picamos mucho entre horas, pero la oferta de snacks está muy limitada: el 99.9% de los snacks de un supermercado son carbohidratos y grasas; su consumo en exceso junto con una falta de actividad física son la principal causa del sedentarismo. Por ello es clave hacer deporte y comer de forma equilibrada.
El Biltong es el primer snack proteico gourmet natural del mercado. La proteina es más saciante que el carbohidrato o la grasa, no se acumula (engorda) y es esencial para la regeneración de los órganos vitales y músculos. Se trata de ""un bistec para llevar"" ya que lo unica que hacemos es macerarlo, especiarlo, secarlo, cortarlo y envasarlo en amosfera controlada. Un producto minimamente procesado, sin alergenos ni aditivos (gama Sasana) y certificado Paleo y Halal.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a team of volunteers from Europe that are involved in development projects in Zambia. We are planning to make the Green House for a proper nutrition source but we also we have projects as an irrigation system and building a hatchery. Our projects are meant to provide food for around 100 street children but also for the children joining the local school.  We have a prototype of the GreenHouse project but suggestions are more than welcome.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We estimated that GreenHouse Project will cost us around 500 euros that will include:</p>
<p>-  bamboo wood, green house foil, bugs net, bricks, cement, nails, manpower cost, fertilizer, seeds, other details.</p>
<p>The funds will go in the project no matter we don't reach the goals but the size and the quality will be lower than we planned. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Giving a wide variety of food for the kids will help them have better health, better focus but also will serve as an example to the people living in the communities around.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges.</h3>
<p>Our main challenge is the lack of experience in the field. The prototype we have in mind is based on our ideas, multitude of video that inspired us and the limited resources that we have available.The risks is that the construction plan might change on the way due to budget, materials found, quality of soil etc.</p>

We understand that not everyone comes with a culinary background, so we designed Steakizmo to allow anyone with any skill level to operate and read with ease. With Steakizmo, you’ll know exactly when your steak is cooked the way you want it without all the fuss.                Who are we to tell you what YOUR rare or medium is? Steakizmo comes ready to use and set to industry standards. However, you have the ability to tweak Steakizmo’s settings using the simple sliders on the Steakizmo app. It’s perfect for grill masters who know exactly what they want!Gone are the days of poking your steak with a fork or probing it with long needles or thermometers. Remember, you’re testing a steak, not a cake. With Steakizmo, you’ll get a simple, clear reading on the digital display within three seconds without piercing the steak. Once you’ve measured one steak, you’re instantly ready to measure another. No wires and no probes with all of the flavor.The main part of Steakizmo is water resistant and can be wet wiped, while the bottom part, which touches the meat, can be detached and washed by hand or in the dishwasher.Steakizmo is fully developed, tested and ready for manufacture, we have used the best in the industry to design and build a quality product ready to help you cook a perfect steak!  Instead of measuring your steak using a probe, Steakizmo measures the firmness of the meat through the pressure exerted onto the device’s sensor. The data is recorded by an electronic meter that sends the reading to the microprocessor.  Steakizmo comes with two buttons, one that change the thickness of the steak being tested in measurements of .5 inches up to 3 inches and the other to reset Steakizmo following a reading. We also included a handy measurement indicator on the side so you can easily measure the thickness of the meat prior to cooking. It doesn’t have to be an exact measurement.The microprocessor uses the thickness and resistance of the meat to calculate the level to which the steak is cooked, which then displays the result on an LCD screen in a simple, clear reading for you within 3 seconds. Basically we mechanized an age old chef’s method of testing a steak with your fingers to judge the firmness of a steak.

<p>We all want to eat highly nutritious food. The best way to ensure that we do is to have healthy ingredients readily available.

Ktchy is a (very) small company outside of Portland, OR with a passion to create innovative products that you will love. We use good quality wood, glass, and metal to create a strong and durable piece of functional art.  
We've already worked out the kinks for a high-quality production process and can create 10 units per week. We are limiting this campaign at 50 total units to guaranteed fulfillment by Dec 15th, 2019. 
 
Reaching our campaign goal of $10,000 will allow us to really get things rolling. We want to bootstrap to success. By this, we mean that we would like to reinvest the profits from this campaign into expanding our manufacturing capabilities. Then... rinse and repeat: launch a campaign for a new design and again reinvest the profit into expansion of our capabilities. A few iterations of this and we'll have a full product line and a sustainable company. 
 
Help get the word out
Backing one of our products isn't the only way to contribute to the campaign. We believe there are enough like minded people for us to reach our goal, we just need to find them. If you know anyone who would appreciate our mission, please share this page. There are sharing options in the title section at the top of this page. 
 
 
 
 
 
Thank You
We have other fun ideas for our next few products. Where it goes from there is only limited by our imagination. With a deep-seated goal of making cooking more enjoyable, we have a large canvas to work with.  
 
We'd love you hear from you if you have questions or comments.

<p>In the last year, we have been working against the clock by selecting the best grapes, carefully studying the design of the bottle and the label, as well as looking for the best material for our peculiar magic game.</p>
<p>After thorough research we have established contacts with manufacturers all over the world, with years of experience in their fields that have allowed us to create the product we had in mind.</p>
<p>The bottle is of the highest quality, as well as labels and magic paper. We manufacture in our own facilities and we have everything under control. But like any new product we are not exempt of risks.</p>
<p>The biggest of them is the time and the commitment to deliver within the margins that we offer you. We can assure you that we will do everything in our power, and even more, to meet the deadlines. However, there could be unexpected circumstances that delay delivery times. We ask you patience and we promise you the delivery of a quality product to each of our patrons as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Naravno, u takvim projektima potrebno je dosta sredstava. Sakupio sam dosta, ali još malo fali, pa da malo i zajednica pomogne i uključi se u ovaj projekt.</p>

<p>Pitanje stoji na mjestu, zašto ulagati baš u nas...</p>
<p>U ponudi ćemo imati 10 točionika s craft pivom, najviše naših umotvorina,ali to ne isključuje i guestbeers od drugih pivovara. Što se tiče boca, u ponudi će se naći šarolika lepeza stranih i domaćih kvalitetnih piva. Uz pivo uvijek ide dobar whiskey, tako da ćemo ponudu upotpuniti s raznim žesticama raznih proizvođača.</p>
<p>Specijalnih serija mjesečnih i sezonskih piva na našim točionicima neće faliti, a za sve ostale vrline pozivamo vas na naše otvorenje, pa ih i sami otkrijte!</p>
<p><strong>Zašto Veles</strong></p>
<p>Veles je u slavenskoj mitologiji bio vladar (bog) zemlje, vode, šuma i podzemlja, ali je povezivan i sa zmajevima, stokom, magijom, pa čak i glazbenicima.<br/>Pošto su u slavenskoj mitologiji sve bogove odlikovale i dobre i loše karakteristike, mi smo odlučili zadržati ove pozitivne za nas...</p>

U ponudi ćemo imati 10 točionika s craft pivom, najviše naših umotvorina,ali to ne isključuje i guestbeers od drugih pivovara. Što se tiče boca, u ponudi će se naći šarolika lepeza stranih i domaćih kvalitetnih piva. Uz pivo uvijek ide dobar whiskey, tako da ćemo ponudu upotpuniti s raznim žesticama raznih proizvođača.
Specijalnih serija mjesečnih i sezonskih piva na našim točionicima neće faliti, a za sve ostale vrline pozivamo vas na naše otvorenje, pa ih i sami otkrijte!
Zašto Veles
Veles je u slavenskoj mitologiji bio vladar (bog) zemlje, vode, šuma i podzemlja, ali je povezivan i sa zmajevima, stokom, magijom, pa čak i glazbenicima.Pošto su u slavenskoj mitologiji sve bogove odlikovale i dobre i loše karakteristike, mi smo odlučili zadržati ove pozitivne za nas...
Pomoći nam možete i na druge načine....
Znamo da svi ne mogu pomoći donacijama, ali uvijek mogu pomoći dobrom riječju.

<p>The last 3 years have been a lonely period. I've travelled far and wide.  Had lots of new experiences but I've felt unconnected.</p>

<p>A week later, I found an ecovillage.  4 months later I came to Gotland.</p>
<p>And here I am.  I'm in Gotland.  The ecovillage didn't work out but I'm still here.</p>
<p>Why?
 Because there is something magical about this island and  I think it's

THE EXCITING ADVENTURES OF A CRAZY ENGLISH DUDE ADRIAN BECKETT AND HIS CHOCOLATE FACTORY
This is madness: I don't know if you believe in visions, buddhism or any of that but let me tell you a story.
A
 few months ago, I visited a buddhist monastery.  I woke up one night 
crying from a nightmare.  I knew I had to make a change.  I knew I 
needed people.
The last 3 years have been a lonely period. I've travelled far and wide.  Had lots of new experiences but I've felt unconnected.

A week later, I found an ecovillage.  4 months later I came to Gotland.
And here I am.  I'm in Gotland.  The ecovillage didn't work out but I'm still here.
Why?
 Because there is something magical about this island and  I think it's

to validate this baby i.e see if people want great chocolate

your excitement

money to cover the costs of shipping over some great cacao from Colombia

   The ImpactBuild a company that:  puts people before profit
 is sustainable.  Think -  chocolate on a yacht sailing to the mainland.
 adopts the best practices from Google, Zappos.....with an emphasis on happiness, flow, free time for their employees
pays for their staff to go on retreats where they can recharge, reflect and love their families deeply
    Risks & Challenges    My plane falling from the sky. I have to return to Colombia to get the machines
 You not liking the chocolate.  Impossible - you'll love it.
    Other Ways You Can Help  Say hi.  I'm new to Gotland so I'd love to meet you.

<p><strong>""Tomato ideal"" brand 100% tomato juice for the whole family</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lycopene in tomato juice is called ""gold in plants""!</strong></p>
<p><strong>At present, tomato juice is popular in Europe, America, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The antioxidant capacity of lycopene is 3.2 times that of carotene, 100 times that of vitamin E and 1000 times that of vitamin C.</strong></p>
<p><strong>""Tomato ideal"" brand 100% Xinjiang tomato juice contains at least 20mg lycopene per can, which is equivalent to the lycopene absorption of 400 tomatoes raw!</strong></p>
<p> <strong>The price of drinks, the experience of nutrition!Just one can, protect your health!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our bodies rust every day, you know?</strong></p>
<p>Our car will be maintained regularly, but our most precious body is often ignored!It has become the norm for Chinese people to make money with their bodies when they are young and to buy their lives when they are old.Why don't you take good care of yourself when you are young?Make money at the same time must take good care of the body, if you ignore it, it will slowly betray you... Pro, must remember!According to the survey, although the life expectancy of Chinese people has been extended, about half of the people over 65 years old in China have been taking a variety of drugs due to different diseases. Most of the elderly spend their days in the hospital intermittently.</p>
<p>However, this is not necessarily the case. In fact, many people&amp;apos;s suffering from diseases can be prevented through maintenance in middle age or controlled by nutrition adjustment now.</p>
<p>In the United States, there are more and more ""senior citizens"" who are in good physical and mental condition. They are always healthy and full of vitality. We can see them in tennis courts, adult education classes, gymnasiums, and sometimes even in professional places.Researchers have conducted research on these elderly people who have a good old age and found that the maintenance carried out as early as middle age is the cornerstone of their good health after old age!</p>
<p><strong>It&amp;apos;s better to keep in good health in advance than to spend money on treatment</strong></p>
<p>When the ruddy complexion quietly fades away, the wrinkles of years climb up the woman&amp;apos;s face; when the energy is overdrawn for a long time, the pressure of career makes men unable to do what they want; when the heart and brain function is failing day by day, parents always have to face the threat of vascular sclerosisWe can&amp;apos;t help asking: what steals our health?</p>
<p>British scientists have pointed out: iron will rust, silver will turn black, in fact, the human body will rust.The aging process of human body is similar to that of cut apple, which is the result of oxidation.Many chronic diseases of human beings are caused by oxidative stress, that is, the human body is rusting every day. The ""rust"" produced is called ""free radical"" in medicine, which is the root of many diseases of human body.Environmental pollution, life pressure, radiation and other factors are ""oxidizing"" our bodies all the time, reducing human life expectancy.""Oxidation"" is the main culprit that deprives people of health in life, and it is an important factor that leads to human aging and health problems!Experiments show that animals with low oxidative metabolism rate and strong antioxidant capacity are not easy to get sick, stronger and have the longest life span.</p>
<p>With the increase of age, our self-healing ability becomes weaker, and the damage caused by free radicals is manifested, such as wrinkles, color spots, poor energy, organ aging, arteriosclerosis, diabetes, cataract, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer&amp;apos;s disease, arthritis, cancer, etc., which are considered to be related to free radicals.</p>
<p>With the improvement of living standards, the popularization of nutrition knowledge and the improvement of health care awareness, the harm of chronic diseases related to diet is not only valued by the state and society, but also aroused people&amp;apos;s general concern. The concept of ""prevention is more important than treatment"" has gradually replaced the habit of ""treating diseases only when they are sick"".</p>
<p>Our goal is not to turn back the clock, but to live the best quality of life at the age of 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and even 100!</p>
<p><strong>""Wolf peach"" in South America becomes a new favorite of European and American family maintenance</strong></p>
<p>Tomato, which is rich in nutrition and delicious, is known as the fruit delicacy and the ruby of green world.It is said that the hometown of tomato is in Peru and Mexico. It was originally a wild berry growing in the forest. It was originally called ""wolf peach"". The fruit is rich in nutrition and has a special flavor.According to records, in the 16th century, a Duke of England named orodala was traveling in South America. He liked tomatoes very much, so he brought them back to England as a gift of love to his lover Queen Elizabeth to express his love.Since then, the names of ""love fruit"" and ""lover fruit"" have been widely spread.Europeans began to plant tomatoes in courtyards and gardens, and as a symbol of love and friendship gifts between men and women.</p>
<p><strong>Time of the United States selects the food that contributes the most to human health</strong></p>
<p>American ""time"" magazine introduced many kinds of food which are beneficial to modern people&amp;apos;s health, among which tomato ranked the first.Tomato is rich in antioxidants, which can prevent the damage of free radicals to the skin. It has obvious effects of beauty, anti wrinkle, anti-aging, improving energy, protecting organs, and can greatly reduce the risk of cancer.</p>
<p>Tomato juice is very popular in European and American countries. It is said that Americans who pay attention to health care should drink two things when they wake up in the morning and before going to bed at night: one is milk, and the other is tomato juice.According to statistics, the per capita consumption of tomatoes in European and American countries is more than 30 times of that in China. In particular, 100% pure tomato juice has become an essential maintenance product for the whole family in European and American families.Drinking a glass of tomato juice every day brings obvious benefits to the maintenance oriented European and American people.The old people often drink it to delay aging, protect heart, brain, prostate and other important organs. The men often drink it with vigorous energy, while the women often drink it to beautify and beautify the skin, remove wrinkles and spots.</p>
<p><strong>200g tomato juice, supplement the whole body nutrition</strong></p>
<p>At present, tomato has been proved to contain a variety of vitamins and nutrients, rich in vitamin C and a, folic acid, potassium these main nutrients.In particular, it contains lycopene, it really has the effect of love, can make girls more beautiful!We see that loving and scientific mothers tend to make their children eat more tomatoes.According to the nutritionist&amp;apos;s research and determination: each person eats 200 grams of tomato juice every day, which can protect the human health system and meet the human body&amp;apos;s needs for a variety of vitamins and minerals.</p>
<ul style=""list-style-type:circle;"">
<li> Tomato juice is rich in vitamins, alkalis, cellulose and pectin, and is rich in lycopene. Lycopene is the strongest antioxidant, which can delay aging, beautifying beauty, improving energy and enhancing immunity. The higher the content of lycopene in human plasma, the lower the incidence rate of cancer and coronary heart disease.</li>
<li> Tomato juice contains a variety of organic acids. In addition to protecting vitamin C from damage, organic acids can also soften blood vessels, promote the absorption of calcium and iron, and help stomach juice digest fat and protein, which is beyond other vegetables and fruits;</li>
<li> Tomato juice also contains a kind of anti-cancer and anti-aging substance called glutathione. Studies have found that tomato juice can prevent some types of cancer, inhibit breast cancer, lung cancer, endometrial cancer, and also fight lung cancer and colon cancer;</li>
<li> Lycopene has the effect of diuresis and inhibiting the growth of bacteria. It is an excellent antioxidant and can remove free radicals in human body;</li>
<li> Tomato juice also has the effect of beauty, appetite, protein digestion, reduce stomach distension.Its characteristics are between fruits and vegetables, rich in vitamin A and C. due to the protection of organic acids, vitamin C can not be destroyed in tomato cooking.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lycopene, the strongest antioxidant in nature</strong></p>
<p>1913Lycopene, the strongest antioxidant found in plants in nature, was first found in cooked tomatoes.Its antioxidant capacity is 3.2 times that of carotene, 100 times that of vitamin E and 1000 times that of vitamin C.Science has proved that the free radicals in human body are the main culprits of human autoimmune system.Lycopene is more effective than other carotenoids and vitamin E in scavenging free radicals, and its rate constant of quenching singlet oxygen is 100 times that of vitamin E.It is of great significance to prevent skin aging, prevent cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, prostate diseases, remove garbage in the body, enhance the human immune system and delay aging.It can effectively prevent and treat various diseases caused by aging and immune decline.Therefore, it is concerned by experts all over the world.</p>
<p><strong>Drinking cooked tomato juice is the best way to supplement lycopene</strong></p>
<p>Lycopene is known as ""gold in plants"".At present, lycopene has been widely accepted in Europe, America, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan.A cup of cooked tomato juice every day has become the living habit of high-quality families, and cooked tomato juice has become the top maintenance product for European and American families!</p>
<p>Lycopene widely exists in various organs and tissues of human body.It is mainly distributed in human blood, adrenal gland, liver, testis, prostate, breast, ovary, uterus, digestive tract and other organs, in which blood, adrenal gland, liver and testis contain more lycopene.Moreover, the content of lycopene in human body is related to human life span.Lycopene can also inhibit the oxidation of low density lipoprotein and resist ultraviolet radiation.</p>
<p>The United States and Japan have produced lycopene as the main active ingredient of drugs, its main role is to reduce blood pressure, treat high cholesterol, high blood lipid, reduce the activity of cancer cells.Lycopene is used to prevent prostate cancer in the United States and France.Israel and Australia have products used to prevent ultraviolet burns, protect skin, strengthen skin and nourish beauty.</p>
<p>The human body can&amp;apos;t make lycopene, so it needs to take it from the diet. Eating a raw tomato can only absorb 0.05 mg of lycopene; only the tomato juice with proper ripening degree can greatly improve the absorption of lycopene through wall breaking technology.</p>
<p><strong>The strongest antioxidant in the plant world</strong></p>
<p><strong>Delaying aging and enhancing immunity</strong></p>
<p><strong>Beautify and nourish the face, remove the rubbish in the body</strong></p>
<p><strong>Protect the prostate, protect the heart and brain</strong></p>
<p><strong>Powerful tomato juice, you can&amp;apos;t expect the maintenance effect</strong></p>
<p>Tomato juice is rich in lycopene, which has a variety of maintenance functions. Many families in Europe and the United States take natural tomato juice for a long time. Many people at the age of 40 can have a 20-year-old body, and those at the age of 60 can have a 40-year-old body.</p>
<p><strong>Delaying aging and enhancing immunity</strong></p>
<p>The aging of human body is closely related to the lack of lycopene. At the age of 40, it is the best time to prevent the aging and physical diseases. The way is to supplement lycopene.One lycopene molecule in tomato juice can quench tens of thousands of free radicals, and its antioxidant capacity is 100 times that of vitamin E and 1000 times that of vitamin C.It can effectively eliminate free radicals in human body, maintain normal metabolism of cells and prevent aging.Lycopene is absorbed in the body through the digestive tract mucosa, enters the blood and lymph, distributes to the testis, adrenal gland, prostate, pancreas, breast, ovary, liver, lung, colon, skin and various mucosal tissues, promotes the secretion of hormones by glands, so as to keep the human body vigorous; eliminates the free radicals in these organs and tissues, protects them from injury, and enhances the immunity of the bodyPestilence makes people less likely to get sick.</p>
<p><strong>Italy confirmed that prevention and inhibition of cancer</strong></p>
<p>One of the important mechanisms of tumorigenesis is that tissue cells undergo gene mutation under the action of external mutagens. Lycopene in tomato juice can block this process, effectively quench free radicals, and achieve the role of tumor prevention.For the formed tumor, it can promote intercellular signal transmission, inhibit and differentiate, induce cancer cells, and make them correct.</p>
<p>In Greece, Italy and other Mediterranean countries, where residents often eat barbecue food, barbecue food is easy to induce cancer.However, the incidence rate of cervical cancer, prostate cancer and liver cancer is low in this area.Because local people often eat tomato products - tomato juice and ketchup.Tomato juice is a necessary drink for them to roast fish and meat.This diet method reduces the mutagen effect in fried and baked food, and greatly reduces the cancer incidence.One of the main reasons for the formation of cancer cells is the sudden malignant transformation of genes by tissue cells under the action of external mutagens.Lycopene can inhibit the mutation process and prevent cancer.</p>
<p>The Italy Medical Research Institute used Lycopene in tomato juice to prevent cancer. It has been proved that lycopene can reduce the incidence rate of various cancers, especially the decrease of esophageal, gastric, colon and prostate cancer.</p>
<p>A comparative study conducted by the University of Illinois in the US found that incidence rate of cervical cancer is 5 times higher in women with low lycopene content than those with high lycopene in vivo.</p>
<p>The researchers studied 93 cases of lung cancer patients and 102 cases of non tumor controls, and detected the concentration of lycopene in the blood. The results showed that the concentrations of various nutrients in the blood of the two groups were similar, only lycopene was different. The concentration of lycopene in the tissues of lung cancer patients was significantly lower than that of the control group.</p>
<p>In this study, 26 patients with prostate cancer waiting for surgery were divided into two groups: one group took lycopene extracted from tomatoes, 15 mg twice a day; the other group did not take lycopene.Three weeks later, I was surprised to find that in patients taking lycopene, the tumor size was significantly reduced, and some were almost eliminated.</p>
<p><strong>Improving cataract and age-related macular degeneration</strong></p>
<p>According to Marius palman of the University of Wisconsin in the United States, compared with people with low blood lycopene concentration, people with high blood lycopene concentration are 50% less likely to develop age-related macular disease</p>

Our bodies rust every day, you know?
Our car will be maintained regularly, but our most precious body is often ignored!It has become the norm for Chinese people to make money with their bodies when they are young and to buy their lives when they are old.Why don't you take good care of yourself when you are young?Make money at the same time must take good care of the body, if you ignore it, it will slowly betray you... Pro, must remember!According to the survey, although the life expectancy of Chinese people has been extended, about half of the people over 65 years old in China have been taking a variety of drugs due to different diseases. Most of the elderly spend their days in the hospital intermittently.
However, this is not necessarily the case. In fact, many people&apos;s suffering from diseases can be prevented through maintenance in middle age or controlled by nutrition adjustment now.
In the United States, there are more and more ""senior citizens"" who are in good physical and mental condition. They are always healthy and full of vitality. We can see them in tennis courts, adult education classes, gymnasiums, and sometimes even in professional places.Researchers have conducted research on these elderly people who have a good old age and found that the maintenance carried out as early as middle age is the cornerstone of their good health after old age!
It&apos;s better to keep in good health in advance than to spend money on treatment
When the ruddy complexion quietly fades away, the wrinkles of years climb up the woman&apos;s face; when the energy is overdrawn for a long time, the pressure of career makes men unable to do what they want; when the heart and brain function is failing day by day, parents always have to face the threat of vascular sclerosisWe can&apos;t help asking: what steals our health?
British scientists have pointed out: iron will rust, silver will turn black, in fact, the human body will rust.The aging process of human body is similar to that of cut apple, which is the result of oxidation.Many chronic diseases of human beings are caused by oxidative stress, that is, the human body is rusting every day. The ""rust"" produced is called ""free radical"" in medicine, which is the root of many diseases of human body.Environmental pollution, life pressure, radiation and other factors are ""oxidizing"" our bodies all the time, reducing human life expectancy.""Oxidation"" is the main culprit that deprives people of health in life, and it is an important factor that leads to human aging and health problems!Experiments show that animals with low oxidative metabolism rate and strong antioxidant capacity are not easy to get sick, stronger and have the longest life span.
With the increase of age, our self-healing ability becomes weaker, and the damage caused by free radicals is manifested, such as wrinkles, color spots, poor energy, organ aging, arteriosclerosis, diabetes, cataract, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer&apos;s disease, arthritis, cancer, etc., which are considered to be related to free radicals.
With the improvement of living standards, the popularization of nutrition knowledge and the improvement of health care awareness, the harm of chronic diseases related to diet is not only valued by the state and society, but also aroused people&apos;s general concern. The concept of ""prevention is more important than treatment"" has gradually replaced the habit of ""treating diseases only when they are sick"".
Our goal is not to turn back the clock, but to live the best quality of life at the age of 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and even 100!
""Wolf peach"" in South America becomes a new favorite of European and American family maintenance

Lycopene, the strongest antioxidant in nature
1913Lycopene, the strongest antioxidant found in plants in nature, was first found in cooked tomatoes.Its antioxidant capacity is 3.2 times that of carotene, 100 times that of vitamin E and 1000 times that of vitamin C.Science has proved that the free radicals in human body are the main culprits of human autoimmune system.Lycopene is more effective than other carotenoids and vitamin E in scavenging free radicals, and its rate constant of quenching singlet oxygen is 100 times that of vitamin E.It is of great significance to prevent skin aging, prevent cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, prostate diseases, remove garbage in the body, enhance the human immune system and delay aging.It can effectively prevent and treat various diseases caused by aging and immune decline.Therefore, it is concerned by experts all over the world.
Drinking cooked tomato juice is the best way to supplement lycopene
Lycopene is known as ""gold in plants"".At present, lycopene has been widely accepted in Europe, America, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan.A cup of cooked tomato juice every day has become the living habit of high-quality families, and cooked tomato juice has become the top maintenance product for European and American families!
Lycopene widely exists in various organs and tissues of human body.It is mainly distributed in human blood, adrenal gland, liver, testis, prostate, breast, ovary, uterus, digestive tract and other organs, in which blood, adrenal gland, liver and testis contain more lycopene.Moreover, the content of lycopene in human body is related to human life span.Lycopene can also inhibit the oxidation of low density lipoprotein and resist ultraviolet radiation.
The United States and Japan have produced lycopene as the main active ingredient of drugs, its main role is to reduce blood pressure, treat high cholesterol, high blood lipid, reduce the activity of cancer cells.Lycopene is used to prevent prostate cancer in the United States and France.Israel and Australia have products used to prevent ultraviolet burns, protect skin, strengthen skin and nourish beauty.
The human body can&apos;t make lycopene, so it needs to take it from the diet. Eating a raw tomato can only absorb 0.05 mg of lycopene; only the tomato juice with proper ripening degree can greatly improve the absorption of lycopene through wall breaking technology.

Powerful tomato juice, you can&apos;t expect the maintenance effect
Tomato juice is rich in lycopene, which has a variety of maintenance functions. Many families in Europe and the United States take natural tomato juice for a long time. Many people at the age of 40 can have a 20-year-old body, and those at the age of 60 can have a 40-year-old body.
Delaying aging and enhancing immunity
The aging of human body is closely related to the lack of lycopene. At the age of 40, it is the best time to prevent the aging and physical diseases. The way is to supplement lycopene.One lycopene molecule in tomato juice can quench tens of thousands of free radicals, and its antioxidant capacity is 100 times that of vitamin E and 1000 times that of vitamin C.It can effectively eliminate free radicals in human body, maintain normal metabolism of cells and prevent aging.Lycopene is absorbed in the body through the digestive tract mucosa, enters the blood and lymph, distributes to the testis, adrenal gland, prostate, pancreas, breast, ovary, liver, lung, colon, skin and various mucosal tissues, promotes the secretion of hormones by glands, so as to keep the human body vigorous; eliminates the free radicals in these organs and tissues, protects them from injury, and enhances the immunity of the bodyPestilence makes people less likely to get sick.
Italy confirmed that prevention and inhibition of cancer
One of the important mechanisms of tumorigenesis is that tissue cells undergo gene mutation under the action of external mutagens. Lycopene in tomato juice can block this process, effectively quench free radicals, and achieve the role of tumor prevention.For the formed tumor, it can promote intercellular signal transmission, inhibit and differentiate, induce cancer cells, and make them correct.
In Greece, Italy and other Mediterranean countries, where residents often eat barbecue food, barbecue food is easy to induce cancer.However, the incidence rate of cervical cancer, prostate cancer and liver cancer is low in this area.Because local people often eat tomato products - tomato juice and ketchup.Tomato juice is a necessary drink for them to roast fish and meat.This diet method reduces the mutagen effect in fried and baked food, and greatly reduces the cancer incidence.One of the main reasons for the formation of cancer cells is the sudden malignant transformation of genes by tissue cells under the action of external mutagens.Lycopene can inhibit the mutation process and prevent cancer.
The Italy Medical Research Institute used Lycopene in tomato juice to prevent cancer. It has been proved that lycopene can reduce the incidence rate of various cancers, especially the decrease of esophageal, gastric, colon and prostate cancer.
A comparative study conducted by the University of Illinois in the US found that incidence rate of cervical cancer is 5 times higher in women with low lycopene content than those with high lycopene in vivo.
The researchers studied 93 cases of lung cancer patients and 102 cases of non tumor controls, and detected the concentration of lycopene in the blood. The results showed that the concentrations of various nutrients in the blood of the two groups were similar, only lycopene was different. The concentration of lycopene in the tissues of lung cancer patients was significantly lower than that of the control group.
In this study, 26 patients with prostate cancer waiting for surgery were divided into two groups: one group took lycopene extracted from tomatoes, 15 mg twice a day; the other group did not take lycopene.Three weeks later, I was surprised to find that in patients taking lycopene, the tumor size was significantly reduced, and some were almost eliminated.
Improving cataract and age-related macular degeneration
According to Marius palman of the University of Wisconsin in the United States, compared with people with low blood lycopene concentration, people with high blood lycopene concentration are 50% less likely to develop age-related macular disease
10 European countries found that the protection of heart and brain
Lipoprotein oxidation is a key factor in the development of atherosclerosis.Lycopene plays an important role in reducing lipoprotein oxidation.It can remove vascular garbage, regulate plasma cholesterol concentration, inhibit arteriosclerosis formation and protect LDL from oxidation.It can also repair and improve the oxidized cells, promote the formation of intercellular glia, and enhance the flexibility of blood vessels.
According to reports, oral lycopene rich tomato juice can reduce serum cholesterol to below 5.20 mmol / L, which can slow down the development of cardiovascular disease.According to the research reports of 10 European countries, it is concluded that the intake of 30 mg lycopene per day can significantly reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.
""News network"" once reported the experiment of 150 heart disease patients in Cambridge University of England: if they were given lycopene supplement every day for 4 consecutive weeks, the patients&apos; low density cholesterol was significantly reduced, and the side effects were reduced compared with the lipid-lowering drugs, which confirmed that lycopene had a significant effect on the prevention of moderate wind and cardiovascular disease.
Strong anti alcohol effect
The main metabolic process of alcohol in human body is redox reaction, which produces a lot of free radicals.Taking lycopene at ordinary times can increase the amount of alcohol; taking lycopene before drinking can relieve alcohol damage to liver; taking lycopene after drinking can relieve headache, vomiting and other drunken symptoms.
Improve allergy
Lycopene can greatly improve skin allergy, eliminate dry skin and itching caused by skin allergy, and make people feel relaxed and happy.
Protection of mucosal tissue
Lycopene is abundant in various mucosal tissues in the body. Long term administration can improve various discomfort caused by the destruction of mucosal tissues in the body.Such as dry cough, dry eyes, oral ulcer, protection of gastrointestinal mucosa tissue.
In addition, lycopene also has many physiological functions, such as preventing osteoporosis, lowering blood pressure and reducing exercise-induced asthma.
Little tomato juice protects men&apos;s prostate health
With the growth of age, the rapid decline or lack of lycopene in men&apos;s prostate and blood will not be able to resist the erosion of free radicals on cell tissue, especially the damage to prostate tissue.The rapid loss of lycopene is the core of prostatitis and benign prostatic hyperplasia, which is the key to the long-term treatment of prostate disease.Once the content of lycopene in men&apos;s blood drops, it is easy to have dysuria, low back and perineum, lower abdominal acid, distending pain, poor energy, insomnia, amnesia, decreased resistance and other systemic adverse symptoms.
There are many layers of reticular fibers outside the male prostate, which are difficult to have inflammation or bacteria, but common drugs are difficult to work after infection.Lycopene in tomato juice can break through the prostate absorption barrier and directly enter the gland to play a role.In the study of carotenoids, only lycopene has a clear protective effect.Lycopene in tomato juice is transported to all organs of the body through human lipoprotein, with the highest concentration in testis, prostate and adrenal gland.It can remove the toxin that invades the prostate, so as to effectively prevent prostate lesions.Lycopene can also regulate the prostatic fluid, keep the pH value at 6-6.5, provide a comfortable environment for sperm activity, enhance sperm activity and improve male fertility.

<p>With your support we can make this easy to use cast iron seasoning oil and soap available everywhere: from the finest kitchens in Connecticut to the wood fired cook stoves in the farthest reaches, </p>
<h3>More about the How and Why This  is Needed and Wanted in the Market</h3>
<p>Cast iron Seasoning Oil choices have long seemed to be confusing for many cooks who use this traditional cookware. The Seasoning on Cast Iron is what creates that beautiful smooth non stick finish on the cooking surface that Cast Iron is famous for. The debate has raged over the past century about what is better- some say just use bacon grease, some say flax seed oil is best, and some say just use plain vegetable oil like Canola or Soybean.</p>
<p>A little science behind the seasoning- The smooth surface after the Cast Iron i seasoned properly is not actually oil. The process of heating the pan with the seasoning oil on it is known as polymerization. It changes the seasoning oil to a smooth coating of polymers that can then stay smooth while withstanding the cooking temperatures and preserving a smooth non stick cooking surface in the Iron.</p>
<p>While all cooking oils can create some form of polymer surface on the cookware after much research the cooks at the Creation Farm Test Kitchen have created a special blend of Oils that creates a premium cooking surface on the Cast Iron. With this Innovation the Foodieville Cast Iron Seasoning Oil has now been made available for everyone.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1582404555/kixtjpr7qp949nt3nbry.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Easy to Make Your Cast Iron your main choice again</h3>
<p>A simple process - Preheat your oven to 375 degrees, Spray a light coating of Foodieville Cast Iron Oil on the cookware, give it a quick wipe with a paper towel to even it out and place the cookware in the oven upside down for 45 minutes, Shut off the oven and let the cookware cool before removing. Some new Cast Iron products come pre-seasoned yet still benefit from this process before using it. If your Cast Iron is not seasoned or has been treated improperly for a period of time you may want to repeat this process before using it to build up a well seasoned cooking surface.</p>
<h3>We are at a time in our history where nutrition and healthy living has come back into focus in the home kitchen,</h3>
<p>Cast iron cookware is in vogue more than ever with people rapidly replacing the chemically electroplated cookware that has inundated our home kitchens over the past few decades, promising a greater ease for cooking but at a highly toxic price as the cookware starts to age and the chemical surface begins chipping and scaling off into our food.</p>

18x more Vitamin B1 than Fresh milk

7.5x more Zinc than Soybean milk

4.9x more Magnesium than Almond milk

1.8x more Phosphorous than Soybean milk
 Enjoy the amazing health benefits of Horchata

Boosts Immune System and Protects Against Harmful Bacteria and Viruses – a rich source of zinc & copper which is necessary for the normal function of immune system

Reduces the Risk of Heart Disease – excellent source of monounsaturated fat which helps to lower bad cholesterol in our bodies and also rich in Vitamin B1 which contributes to normal functioning of heart and nervous system

Enjoy Higher Energy Levels and Reduction in Tiredness– Source of Phosphorous & Magnesium which helps with energy metabolism to give you the energy you need for the day

Prevents Premature Aging and Wrinkles – Source of antioxidant Vitamin E which helps to protect the body against free-radicals that cause premature aging
 The Best Quality Horchata We can Offer YouWe pride ourselves in making high quality products

Higher concentration of nut-to-water ratio to give you that extra creaminess
Most plant milks in the market has a ratio of 1:20 (raw ingredient:water). However, we choose to maintain a ratio of 1:4 (Chufa:water) to give you the best flavour.


Natural fragrant taste without any additional flavourings
We believe in serving you naturally tasty food without using artificial flavourings. To do so, we experimented with different sources of Chufas and recipes over a span of 6 months to obtain the perfect taste.


Direct from source and using the best Chufas
To source for the best Chufas, we screened through many suppliers and even flew down personally to the farms in Valencia, Spain, before deciding on a trusted partner to work with.

 How it startedWe first tried Horchata in Barcelona during a summer college vacation and it was love at first taste – simply heavenly! Later on, after realising that this version of Horchata was not widely found in other parts of the world, we started our mission to make this gem accessible in Singapore and hopefully beyond.We have a vision to share this yummy and nutritious horchata with everyone in Singapore and promote a healthier lifestyle. As seen on Hear what others have to say about our HorchataWhat We are OfferingThe longer you subscribe, the more you save!

<p>We are two Iowa families who founded Goats On The Go®, a targeted grazing (AKA goat rental) company, in 2012 as a better way to raise livestock and feed people...to produce meat that delivers more to the world than it takes.</p>
<p>We chose to raise goats because they are uniquely equipped to benefit the world throughout their lives, not just when they become food (like most other livestock). Our goats eat the weeds and brush our customers want rid of, that other food animals can't utilize. In other words, our goats convert nutrients that would otherwise be wasted into nutrition for people! At the same time, they replace the chemical pesticides and disruptive mechanization that would typically be used to control unwanted vegetation. And, much of what our herd eats are invasive plant species, which are a huge threat to native landscapes all over North America.</p>
<p>After several years of growth, it's now time for Goats On The Go® to share our Meat Made Good with a wider audience. </p>

<p>We raise our goats slowly, without added hormones or feeding regimens designed to produce unnatural rapid growth.

Our goats are 19 - 20 months old and around 100 pounds at harvest, so each animal delivers maximum benefit to the world in terms of conservation and calories.</p>

<p>Our vision for meat production is to be big while being small. To be local while being national. To scale up without watering down our standards. To do this we are growing a network of goat grazing affiliates all over the country. These are hometown businesses that provide weed and brush control with their own goat herds to nearby customers under the Goats On The Go® brand. After just two years of offering our affiliate program the network has grown to 16 affiliates in six U.S. states. We expect ever greater geographic reach in coming years.</p>
<p>Initially, all our goat meat will be processed by Story City Locker, a local family-owned butcher near our founding place in Central Iowa.

Bloom was developed to help people grow their indoor gardens at home - whether those were plants in their living room, or herbs in their kitchen. Our technology has been optimized to consume very little energy; creating minimal impact on the environment, and your energy bill. </p><p>We manufactured a series of 1000 Blooms, which we assembled with our own hands. We delivered our products to the greatest plantshops in The Netherlands, Belgium, and Europe; we even sent some all the way down to Australia. We learned a lot throughout the process. We realised that, if we want to make an impact, we need to develop partnerships that enable us to better deliver high-quality mass-produced goods.</p><p>We really saw magic happen when Bloom was implemented in various greenhouse lighting projects in Europe, and one of our farmers had great success growing microgreens. Throughout our partnership, we have seen first-hand how easy it is to grow microgreens. The more we learned about the nutritional benefits of microgreens, the more we were in awe of this tiny superfood, and the more curious we became. Thus, came the inspiration for our next product design - MicroFarm, a modular countertop system that uses Bloom's full-spectrum light technology, to enable anyone to grow microgreens at home. The best part is your body reaps the rewards of the countless health benefits microgreens offer (pun intended)!</p><p> </p><h1>Mother | <strong>Our Future</strong> </h1><p>MicroFarm is a micro step towards self-sufficiency. With six new products planned to go-to market globally over the upcoming two years, we are prepared to scale our impact at a fast rate. Products that will disrupt the way we buy food, water and electricity, and that will change the way we live.</p><p>We partner with experts and companies with a proven track record, across different industries. Together, we launch sustainable products for self-sufficient living. Today, we are comprised of an international team of 12 active entrepreneurs/experts. We are fortunate to work with global partners; VanHoecke is a proud partner of ours, a market leader in kitchen manufacturing in the BE/NL area in Europe.</p><p>Are you an entrepreneur/expert? Maybe you're a market leader in a specific region and want to help us get our products into every household? Join us in our mission for self-sufficiency.</p><p> </p><h1><strong>Press:</strong></h1><div data-id=""25083939""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><a href=""https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VC1r9RGvvDiYNtF6OiaV_XJ9bA4U_KD9?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1559162217/ibnlgqls509akbdbl5yv.png"" src=""""/> </a></figure></div><h1> </h1><div data-caption=""This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 650+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them."" data-id=""25250971""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""> </figure></div></div>","Harvest microgreens at home, like a professional indoor farmer.

Full-Spectrum, High Performance 95+ CRI (Color Rendering Index)
14W Light Module with replaceable print board
1250 Lumens 
MicroFarm uses a full-spectrum LED grow-light, which has a CRI of 95+. This means that colours render 95% similar to natural sunlight; in other words, our grow-light mimics the sun. It is the light spectrum that defines how your plants will grow. It has been shown that when conventional blue/red grow-lights are used to grow plants, their colour and flavour profiles do not fully develop. We engineered our grow-lights to use the full-spectrum of light, to grow plants with complete colour and flavour profiles. By using our full-spectrum light technology, you can grow any type of plant, in any stage of growth.  Used by indoor farmers.Below you will find a video of Tom, owner of PachaGreens, showing us how he uses our full-spectrum Bloom LED grow-light modules to grow microgreens at his indoor farm.  
  
 
MicroFarm | A product for life. When LEDs are cooled properly, as within our aluminum profile, they can last for up to 8 years before they start to drop in performance. Because of MicroFarm’s durable and open design, you can easily slide the old LED-board out of the aluminum body and exchange it for a new one, for an estimated price of €9; a fraction of the price of the module. MicroFarm is a product for life.We anodise parts with the thickest anodisation layer possible for a maximum life span.  MicroFarm's durable and open design.  Microgreens, food of the future  If you have never tasted them, you probably won't believe us, but microgreens taste just like their full grown plant! Yet, they contain up to 40x more vital nutrients, and are super easy to grow. Up to 50x cheaper than store-bought microgreensWe are committed to supply seeds at honest prices. One year of SeedSupply for €19. Always. Compared to €19 for a whole year's worth of SeedSupply, we are saving you an impressive amount of money.With MicroFarm, each harvest yields 250grams, or ~9oz. The average grocery store price of 250grams of microgreens is €10 in the EU, and $18 in Canada and the USA.*Per year, you can grow the equivalent of 12.5kg, or ~27lbs, of microgreens. If you purchased this amount in store-bought microgreens, your grocery bill would come to €520 in the EU, or $950 in Canada or the USA.* For above calculations: prices for microgreens are averaged based on prices found in grocery stores in Canada and the USA, as well as several European grocers. Seed prices are averaged from various European garden supply stores. Calculations do not include transportation costs, both for grocery and garden stores, and also for SeedSupply. Easily harvest microgreens, every 7-10 days. Everyone can do it. Check out the 5 easy steps below to help convince your friends and family. Even your little brother or grandmother can grow microgreens!  Modular designMicroFarm can be configured multiple ways. Please note that the Standing Disc and Closet/Wall Mounts are currently only available with the MicroFarm Pro model. They will be available for purchase, separately, following our Kickstarter campaign (est. October 2019)  Grow on any medium We choose to grow our microgreens on paper towel due to its global accessibility, cleanliness, and because it is compost-friendly (although not if it has printed graphics; please consider making a change!). In professional kitchens, chefs cannot have dirt or soil in their work area; it would be unhygienic. Paper towel is the cleanest way to grow microgreens. However, using other types of grow mediums could provide different advantages. This is why our system design is open, so you are able to experiment with different types of media. The seeds we ship are tested using paper towel, yet can also be grown on hemp fiber or in potting soil.  SpecificationsMinimal Energy ConsumptionDuring each day that they are growing, microgreens need 12-14 hours of light. MicroFarm delivers outstanding performance, while consuming a small amount of energy; resulting in a minimal impact on the environment, and your energy bill. Our MicroFarm LED is a 14W light. Using 12 hours of light each day during the growing phase, and at 10 cents/kWh, MicroFarm’s energy consumption will end up costing you around only $6 - over the whole year!Technical Details Indoor farmers don't calculate light strength in Lumens. Lumens is a unit of measure for human beings that describes how much light a source emits. For example, a reading light emits around 450 lumens. For plants, indoor farmers like to use PPFD (photosynthetic photon flux density) or DLI (Daily Light Integral, how much light a plant receives in one day). For MicroFarm, the average DLI is 6 mol·m−2·d−1.Dimensions

 Why Microgreens?Microgreens.The most healthy foods. Superfoods! Microgreens are the seedlings of leafy greens, vegetables, and herbs. They grow approximately 2.5–7.5 cm (1-3 inches) tall, in only 7-10 days. In general, microgreens have a stronger, more intense flavour than that of their mature counterparts. With full-grown plants, you would usually only eat their leaves or fruits; with microgreens, you eat the stem and the leaves, taking in the maximum amount of nutrients that are contained within each seed. The vitamin, mineral and antioxidant levels measured in microgreens, are up to 40 times higher than those recorded for mature, fully grown vegetables or herbs. While their nutrient contents vary slightly, most varieties tend to be rich in potassium, iron, zinc, magnesium, copper, vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin K, and beta carotene. The consumption of microgreens reduces the risk of many health conditions, such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, certain cancers, high blood pressure and Alzheimers. For years, doctors have been recommending an increase in the consumption of leafy greens into the diets of  patients who suffer from these conditions. Microgreens. A vital ingredient in any chef's kitchen.No matter your experience level in the kitchen, microgreens will help to elevate even the most basic of dishes. With MicroFarm, everyone can feel like a top-chef!What food can you eat that is fresher? What fresh food can you eat that has more nutrients?

For our Kickstarter campaign we assembled a young dynamic team with most of us being Belgians while Daria is from Canada! We have offices in Wetteren and production and test facilities in Asse (Belgium).Pieter: Video & Photo + Digital Design & Development Ashley: Digital Marketing + Digital Design & DevelopmentYasmine: Environmental & Product ResearchLander: New Product Design & DevelopmentDaria: Marketing + Business Development North-AmericaAnn-Sofie: Marketing + Business AdministrationDries: New Product Design + Legal & FinanceMother | Why MicroFarm and SeedSupply?We are Mother, an international network of entrepreneurs and designers. Our mission is to develop products that give everyone access to the basic necessities. We strongly believe that everyone should be given the tools to provide for themselves, independent of the social system they live in. In order to fortify our mission, we design our products to last a lifetime.Mother designs to empower. For the people, by the people.With MicroFarm and SeedSupply, we take a microstep towards self-sufficiency, by helping you to grow your own super-healthy food. We want to help to reduce your grocery bill; and we also want to help to reduce the amount of waste produced by, and environmental harm associated with, the food production life-cycle, including packaging and transport.Mother | We Need Your Support! We need your support to start up mass production for MicroFarm, so that we can ship our product out at the lowest possible price, to anyone, anywhere, on our planet. Back us on Kickstarter. We need to invest in moulds, buy seeds in bulk, run pilot-tests, and set up a more professional laboratory... just to mention a few of the things on our list. Mother | Who else would care about you this much? Mother is a global network of entrepreneurs, an incubator and accelerator for all self-sufficiency ideas. We help design and develop these into the most sustainable possible products, mass-produce them and market them globally.It is astonishing how dependent we have become, and how much we pay for basic necessities. We find it self-evident that we always have access to electricity, clean water and food. But what happens if suddenly, we do not?To meet our demands in the future, governments like to sell us the concept of the Universal Basic Income, yet such concepts will make us even more dependent. We want to give everyone on the planet access to basic necessities. If these basic needs are met, we will have more time to focus on the self-exploration and development of our talents. Self-sufficient living should be on top of everyone’s agenda.  Mother | Our Story In 2018, after 5 years of development, Mother launched its first product, Bloom, a full-spectrum LED grow-light system. Bloom was developed to help people grow their indoor gardens at home - whether those were plants in their living room, or herbs in their kitchen. Our technology has been optimized to consume very little energy; creating minimal impact on the environment, and your energy bill. We manufactured a series of 1000 Blooms, which we assembled with our own hands. We delivered our products to the greatest plantshops in The Netherlands, Belgium, and Europe; we even sent some all the way down to Australia. We learned a lot throughout the process. We realised that, if we want to make an impact, we need to develop partnerships that enable us to better deliver high-quality mass-produced goods.We really saw magic happen when Bloom was implemented in various greenhouse lighting projects in Europe, and one of our farmers had great success growing microgreens. Throughout our partnership, we have seen first-hand how easy it is to grow microgreens. The more we learned about the nutritional benefits of microgreens, the more we were in awe of this tiny superfood, and the more curious we became. Thus, came the inspiration for our next product design - MicroFarm, a modular countertop system that uses Bloom's full-spectrum light technology, to enable anyone to grow microgreens at home. The best part is your body reaps the rewards of the countless health benefits microgreens offer (pun intended)! Mother | Our Future MicroFarm is a micro step towards self-sufficiency. With six new products planned to go-to market globally over the upcoming two years, we are prepared to scale our impact at a fast rate. Products that will disrupt the way we buy food, water and electricity, and that will change the way we live.We partner with experts and companies with a proven track record, across different industries. Together, we launch sustainable products for self-sufficient living. Today, we are comprised of an international team of 12 active entrepreneurs/experts. We are fortunate to work with global partners; VanHoecke is a proud partner of ours, a market leader in kitchen manufacturing in the BE/NL area in Europe.Are you an entrepreneur/expert? Maybe you're a market leader in a specific region and want to help us get our products into every household? Join us in our mission for self-sufficiency. Press:",31.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why we’ve decided to make our crowdfunding campaign</strong></p>
<p>After five years of visiting many tea estates in Nepal, one garden particularly stood out, Jasbire tea estate. This was influenced by Sharad’s passion for tea, his skills and engagement in the Jasbire community. In 2015, Sharad, with other tea farmers gathered to offer a unique approach to tea making, and to improve the environment, soil and culture.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531322526/uaragbjpf2txdqrdqmhd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tealure is launching this project to seek international attention to help start this truly unique initiative. We aim to encourage and give voice to the Jasbire tea producers who have been silently mastering the art of specialty tea making for a decade, and are finally starting to make use of their approach.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our Story</strong></p>
<p>Tealure was founded by Ernestas Klevas, and at the time, he was an MA student, who travelled to Nepal to collect data for his thesis. While he was there, he discovered some local tea farmers in the highlands of the Himalayas who were producing the finest quality tea.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531322986/fewrtjguzizw0cq4742v.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In 2014, Tealure started selling loose leaf tea online and in several outlets around Copenhagen, ranging from neighborhood cafes to Michelin star restaurants, and then, established itself as a high quality brand.  </p>
<p>In 2016, together with 220 backers, we made our first promise to extend our value chain and to commence tea packaging in Nepal.</p>
<p>In line with our promise to improve our impact in Nepal, we collaborated with our supply partners, and presently, we promise to deliver even better teas! Let’s start this unique initiative and promote the Sharad and Jasbire Tea estate.</p>
<p>We redesigned our packaging to include a Nepalese plucker- a true icon of the Nepali tea, and the backbone of the country.</p>

<p><strong>The dream  </strong></p>
<p>Sharad has a simple dream; to introduce his teas to people around the world so he can build a school in Jasbire where poor families could send their kids for quality education. Most of these families can only dream of offering their kids good education, and therefore, they end up sending their kids to a public school where the quality of education is very poor. Unlike in many developed countries where kids often come up with silly excuses not to go to school, kids from Nepal dream of schooling. Sharad has a dream to build a school, hire English speaking teachers and provide free education for kids in the local area. We promised to support Jasbire tea which in turn would make a small but meaningful impact on the children’s life</p>

Why we’ve decided to make our crowdfunding campaign
After five years of visiting many tea estates in Nepal, one garden particularly stood out, Jasbire tea estate. This was influenced by Sharad’s passion for tea, his skills and engagement in the Jasbire community. In 2015, Sharad, with other tea farmers gathered to offer a unique approach to tea making, and to improve the environment, soil and culture.

 
Tealure is launching this project to seek international attention to help start this truly unique initiative. We aim to encourage and give voice to the Jasbire tea producers who have been silently mastering the art of specialty tea making for a decade, and are finally starting to make use of their approach.

 
Our Story
Tealure was founded by Ernestas Klevas, and at the time, he was an MA student, who travelled to Nepal to collect data for his thesis. While he was there, he discovered some local tea farmers in the highlands of the Himalayas who were producing the finest quality tea.

In 2014, Tealure started selling loose leaf tea online and in several outlets around Copenhagen, ranging from neighborhood cafes to Michelin star restaurants, and then, established itself as a high quality brand.  
In 2016, together with 220 backers, we made our first promise to extend our value chain and to commence tea packaging in Nepal.
In line with our promise to improve our impact in Nepal, we collaborated with our supply partners, and presently, we promise to deliver even better teas! Let’s start this unique initiative and promote the Sharad and Jasbire Tea estate.
We redesigned our packaging to include a Nepalese plucker- a true icon of the Nepali tea, and the backbone of the country.

 
Jasbire tea  
In 2015, around 153 farmers led by Mr. Sharad Shubba around the tiny village of Jasbire gathered in the most important tea district of Nepal to launch a unique project.
Jasbire Tea has been produced by the local farmers in their own land, and therefore, it is an entirely farm-based production with the ownership still at the farmers’ level. The equipment for tea processing was purchased; experts were assigned as advisors in order to guarantee optimal handling of the leaves.

All they need is little help with sales and international attention, and this is why we are here for them.

 
The dream  
Sharad has a simple dream; to introduce his teas to people around the world so he can build a school in Jasbire where poor families could send their kids for quality education. Most of these families can only dream of offering their kids good education, and therefore, they end up sending their kids to a public school where the quality of education is very poor. Unlike in many developed countries where kids often come up with silly excuses not to go to school, kids from Nepal dream of schooling.

Risks and challenges
During our previous crowdfunding campaign, we inquired problems with our stand up pouches. Due to limited infrastructure and packaging options in Nepal, it is more difficult to find quality goods. This time we will spend more time and efforts to find a proper packaging supplier.
The major risk is ensuring sustainability after the Indiegogo campaign. This cooperation should be able to stand on its own after the campaign. Our wish is to make this initiative sustainable and encourage other entrepreneurs to engage in direct trade in order to empower farmers and tea workers.
We do not want to make this a one-time initiative. Please help us suggest how we could scale our business after the Indiegogo campaign to ensure continuous supply of Nepali specialty teas worldwide.",9.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>Help us take Burning Foot Brewing to the next level! As we've always said, we believe in sharing great beer with great friends, and we are excited for the opporunity to do that on a much larger scale. Given our owners' restaurant backgrounds, we are eager to expand our scope and provide a complete culinary experience--with a purpose. Our farm-to-table brewpub will be a ""first"" for Louisville! </p>
<p><strong>With our vision, our establishment will...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Operate as a full-service restaurant and brewery, featuring fresh, innovative cuisine (sourced locally), Burning Foot Brewing's high-ABV stouts and IPAs , as well as select “grain-to-glass” beers;</li>
<li>Include an on-site garden to support the “field-to-fork” concept;</li>
<li>Provide a relaxing, family-friendly atmosphere with a neighborhood feel; and</li>
<li>Offer beutiful event spaces for weddings, private parties, and/or community meetings.</li>
</ul>
<p>We plan to cultivate more than just the land! We envision a space where friendships--new and old--can flourish! We are also committed to partnering with our neighbors, city government, and other local businesses to enrich the community. </p>
<p>Our long-term plans include organizing neighborhood events, hosting a regular farmers market, and participating in charitable giving.</p>
<ul>
<li>As a veteran-owned business, supporting our servicemen and women, law enforcement officers, and firefighters will be a top priority.</li>
<li>As a farmer-owned business, we'll partner with local schools to provide education on food literacy and sustainabile farming.</li>
<li>And as a family-oriented business, we are dedicated to providing a family-friendly environment and improving the safety and aesthetics of our community.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We believe a farm-to-table restaurant and brewery will be an asset to Louisville's vibrant culinary scene. Furthermore, with your help, we have the unique opportunity to be so much more than a brewpub with good food and drink--we can be a mechanism for doing good!</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are currently under contract on a scenic property in central Louisville--an ideal setting for our vision to come to life! However, the building is not currently operating as a restaurant, so substantial investment must be made to prepare the space for our brewpub. </p>
<p>We aim to raise at least $50,000 on Indiegogo, which will cover a portion of our anticipated expenses. In particular, the Indiegogo donations will be used for capital expenditures, including brewing equipment, refigeration, kegs, furnishings, kitchen equipment, IT/POS, and inventory. </p>
<p>We appreciate contributions of all sizes! See the ""Perks"" section for specific details on donations, but the following benefits are available at different fund levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>A ""Thank You"" Card &amp; Goodie Bag</li>
<li>Limited Edition Opening Day T-Shirt</li>

<p>In most cases, each level includes all of the perks included at lower levels. For example, everyone who contributes $25+ will receive a ""thank you"" card and be featured in the printed programs we'll distribute at our soft and grand openings!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Timeline</h3>
<p>Opening a restaurant and brewery is a time-consuming process and we ask for your patience! While we plan to open the restaurant with a wide selection of guest taps, it will be 2019 before our Burning Foot beers are available on tap. </p>

<p>As we get older, our bodies are no longer friendly to us. We were once able to have a few drinks and feel perfectly fine in the morning. We laughed at older folks who warned us about hangovers.</p>
<p><i>""Hangovers? Not me.""</i></p>
<p>But then, your late 20's show up and all of a sudden, those hangovers aren't the hoax you thought they were. They're actually pretty real. And if you're over 30, forget it, your body is begging you to be boring because it doesn't want to deal with your antics anymore.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>But what if there was a way to prevent hangovers? Or at least minimize them?</p>
<p>This isn't a product that let's you drink more. No. <strong>Nu Day is a supplement compromised of natural ingredients that help our liver better process alcohol, replenish vitamins &amp; minerals that are depleted, and improve sleep quality.</strong></p>
<p>That's one thing that many other hangover pills tend to miss. Alcohol is terrible for our sleep and you need to help the body get a better night's rest. With our product, you definitely will.</p>
<p>We put in a massive amount of research to bring you the best hangover pills. Now we just need your help making Nu Day a reality.</p>
<h3 style=""color: #7A69B3;"">How It Works &amp; What Makes Us Different</h3>
<p>Hangovers have long been an annoyance throughout human history. It's natural for many to have attempted to create a hangover cure pill or other prevention method.</p>
<p>So what makes us different?</p>
<p>In order to best describe what we do differently, let's take a look at what the competition does.</p>
<p><strong>Most Competitor Products</strong></p>
<p><i>1. Vitamin C + Vitamin B Complex</i></p>
<p><i>2. Milk Thistle for the liver</i></p>
<p><i>3.  L-Cysteine (NAC)</i></p>
<center><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/uuXiHns.gif"" src=""""/></center>
<p> </p>
<p>When taking a look at other hangover prevention pills, many of them have similar ingredients, but they don't do enough. We all know that B and C vitamins are excreted through urine during alcohol use, making them mandatory ingredients. But is milk thistle enough to help your liver? Maybe. But at Nu Day, we don't settle. We go above and beyond to help the liver.</p>
<p>Lastly, NAC is fantastic at helping break down alcohol, but the instructions on other products can be wrong, and possibly even dangerous. Many competitors recommend taking their supplements with your first alcoholic beverage, and some even recommend taking them before bed too.</p>
<p>The issue with this is NAC needs to be taken at least an hour before consuming alcohol to be most effective. Also, consuming NAC after alcohol use can cause more harm than good as shown in <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16439183"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this study conducted on mice</a>.</p>

<p><i>1. Vitamin C + Vitamin B Complex</i></p>
<p><i><i>2. Repair liver with Milk Thistle</i></i></p>
<p><i><i>3. Remove fat build up in liver with Taurine</i></i></p>
<p><i><i>4. Break down alcohol's toxic by-product, acetaldehyde, with Dihydromyricentin AND Alpha Lipoic Acid AND L-Cysteine (NAC)</i></i></p>
<p><i><i>5. Prevent nausea, dry mouth and loss of appetite with Prickly Pear Extract AND Ginger</i></i></p>
<p><i><i>6. Improve mental state and lessen dehydration with Panax Ginseng</i></i></p>
<p><i><i>7. Improve sleep quality with L-Theanine</i></i></p>
<p>As you can see, our formula may have some similar ingredients to other hangover supplements, but we have gone above and beyond in order to ensure that you receive a quality product that can effectively combat hangovers.</p>
<p>In addition, the instructions for our product are much more effective than the competition. As mentioned, L-Cysteine (NAC) needs to be taken at least an hour before alcohol use for it to be as safe and effective as possible.</p>

<p>In order to make Nu Day a reality, we need to order a minimum of 5,000 bottles.</p>

Questions?  You can follow us or get in touch on Instagram (@foragedandfoundco) Facebook (@foragedandfoundco or @cabbagesandkings.halstead)Where's the catch?A fixed goal campaign is an all or nothing deal. If we don’t achieve our target of £20,000 we get nothing and I'm not too sure what we do then! So if you loved Cabbages and you believe in us and our amazing little shop then help us reach our target. If we do reach the £20,000 goal the we can set a stretch goal  that would enable us to get some of the bells and whistles stuff like the bread oven and ice-cream machine. I believe the only way for this to be a vibrant, successful and sustainable business is for it not to be a ""half-baked"" version of what it could be so we really need your help to make sure it shines bright! So if you've missed us, and want us back, please do pledge.If you can’t pledge, but believe in our project and want to help in someway then please, please, spread the word, share through your social media, make some noise and get the word out. You never know where it may lead. RISKS AND CHALLENGESWe've overcome some major challenges already and have all the planning approved. We know what we still need to do to complete the project and the infrastructure required to make the business run once its open. We have a clear vision and solid plan for the future. This is going to be awesome!And if you've read this all the way to the end?Thank you!",11.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>My name is Tatiana Pacheco. Me and my husband, Andrew Pacheco are the co-founder’s of Andrea’s Healthy kitchen. A business that was started in 2013, to encourage and promote a healthy detox option through my 100% natural  juices. My goal for all who purchase my product is to help them with a simple 3 or 5-day detox plan. </p>
<p>I love what I do, and it brings me joy when my customers feel and see a difference after drinking my juices on a weekly, monthly and even quarterly basis. My juices promote weight loss and internal cleansing. </p>
<p>I’m proud to say that my business has grown quite a bit from where I started 5 years ago. Andrea’s Healthy Kitchen has now launched a website, we are now sold in Something Healthy Cafe in Monrovia, and are often seen out at numerous community events on a monthly basis. </p>
<p>I hope and pray that my juices will continue to enhance the health for all of those that buy them ... and most importantly  tasty too!</p>
