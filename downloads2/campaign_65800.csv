<p>Our goal was to make Brick Lamp extremely simple to use with a refreshingly clean style. To achieve this we designed Brick Lamp with no buttons or control panel.

So, what’s the secret? NexFan Ultra has taken cool air to the next level by utilizing an atomizer, where traditional swamp coolers only use a moisture pad.

Thanks for your concern and support!As summertime is just around the corner, providing your home with comfortable cooling proves to be a necessity instead of simply a luxury. When the heat is scorching, we’ve got a solution for you: NexFan Ultra Air Cooler, the world’s first UV-C portable air cooler with strong cooling capacity.NexFan Ultra doesn’t just provide you with cool air; it is a 4-in-1 device that provides multiple forms of superior air quality, including refrigeration, humidification, air purification and aromatherapy. It produces instant cooling, is ultra-portable with a USB charger and automatically cleans and purifies the internal reservoir.Scroll down and we’ll explain more...The NexFan Ultra air cooler creates a comfortable micro-climate anywhere you want by providing a breeze cooled by  5℃/9℉, in an instant. Unlike traditional evaporative coolers, we do it faster and enable more coverage with a much longer wind distance.  Conventional air coolers take minutes to provide the proper ambience, but with NexFan, you’ll feel the cold wind in just a few seconds. So, what’s the secret? NexFan Ultra has taken cool air to the next level by utilizing an atomizer, where traditional swamp coolers only use a moisture pad. The atomizer provides more spray volume through water depressurization to achieve a rapid temperature drop. Additionally, we have incorporated a 4.8 x 10 cm plant fiber curtain in our device. This thickened fiber is able to soak in more water and thus allows for more evaporation. Want it even cooler? Try adding ice for some truly frozen wind. Oftentimes a traditional cooler cannot extend the cooling distance, NexFan Ultra’s strong airflow distance can deliver a crisp, refreshing breeze up to 5 ft. NexFan Ultra’s makeup consists of a three-dimensional corrugated network of wet curtains and a filter. This structure is able to produce smooth, natural air and a better wind circulation with multiple blowing angles up to 90° apart. The uniformly distributed wind projects powerful cooling and assures no headaches, given that the wind does not blow in a singular/localized area.Upgraded atomizer, cool faster.

<p>First invented and patented in 1858, the Mason jar is named after its inventor, John Landis Mason.  Originally used in home canning and preserving, the Mason jar has become ubiquitous due to its usefulness. The jar is used for drinking, storage, canning or crafts.  The one thing that sets the Mason jar apart is its standard mouth size.  The regular mouth Mason jar is 2.75 inches (6.985 centimeters) across the top.  The Ergo Spout will fit regular mouth Mason jars, from 12 ounces to half gallon volumes.</p>

<p>The Ergo Spout solves three basic problems with Mason jars.  </p>
<p>First, because Mason jars are glass, they become slippery when wet.  With the Ergo Spout you can avoid those slippery jars and pour without the risk of dropping it.  </p>
<p>The Ergo Spout also allows the possibility of pouring hot liquids such as syrup.  Because your hand need not come in contact with the jar, you can safely pour that hot syrup on your pancakes.  </p>
<p>Last, the Ergo Spout prevents sticky drips down the side of the jar by guiding the liquid to the curved spout.  </p>
<p>The Ergo Spout makes for comfortable, safe pouring without the mess.</p>

<p>When my oldest son was younger, he LOVED pancakes with syrup. It might be more accurate to say that he loved syrup with pancakes. We went though A LOT of syrup at our house.  </p>
<p>My mother-in-law had taught me how to make a simple syrup with maple flavoring. It became a family favorite because it's easy, delicious and economical. She also gave me a fancy syrup dispenser. I loved it and used it all the time. Until...  </p>
<p>One day I chipped the edge while washing it. I searched the internet for a replacement, but couldn't find one. </p>
<p>Then came the light bulb moment: wouldn't it be great if there were a spout and handle for Mason jars!  I looked all over for that too, but couldn't find it.  My husband, Bryce, and I decided to make one ourselves. </p>
<p>Now, after laboring over a ton of versions for the last 18 months, we finally have it ready to manufacture.  We are ready to bring you the Ergo Spout!</p>

<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>Why do you call it the Ergo Spout?  </strong></i></p>
<p>Because of the unique ergonomic handle.  </p>
<p><i><strong>What about a wide mouth version?  </strong></i></p>
<p>Due to interest we have decided to launch the Wide Mouth Ergo Spout with it's own Kickstarter campaign.  After the design, engineering and prototyping is done we will be ready to launch.  Look for it Spring 2019! </p>
<p><i><strong>What will it be made of?  </strong></i></p>
<p>The Ergo Spout will be polypropylene.  Polypropylene is a food safe, non-toxic, BPA-free and Phthalates-free plastic. It will also have a silicone grippy over mold on the handle.  </p>
<p><i><strong>Is it dishwasher and microwave safe?</strong></i>  </p>
<p>Yes. The plastic will not warp in the high heat of a dishwasher or a microwave.  </p>
<p><i><strong>Is it air tight or does it seal?  </strong></i></p>
<p>The Ergo Spout includes a silicone gasket to make a complete seal between the jar and the base of the Ergo Spout. We are working to make it as spill-resistant as possible with our flip-top lid. </p>
<p><i><strong>Is it dripless?  </strong></i></p>
<p>The spout's design reduces dripping and will help prevent drips down the side of the jar. </p>
<p><i><strong>Are there different colors available?  </strong></i></p>
<p>Yes, we are offering it in Vintage Blue, Barn Red, Foliage Green and Classic White. </p>

</div></div>","First invented and patented in 1858, the Mason jar is named after its inventor, John Landis Mason.  Originally used in home canning and preserving, the Mason jar has become ubiquitous due to its usefulness. The jar is used for drinking, storage, canning or crafts.  The one thing that sets the Mason jar apart is its standard mouth size.  The regular mouth Mason jar is 2.75 inches (6.985 centimeters) across the top.  The Ergo Spout will fit regular mouth Mason jars, from 12 ounces to half gallon volumes.

 
The Ergo Spout fits Mason jars whether they were recently manufactured or are of vintage age. This is only for regular mouth Mason jars. 
 

 
The Ergo Spout with different sizes of jars.
 

The Ergo Spout has three physical parts:  

The lid is completely removable. It connects inside the spout, creating a hinge for flip-top functionality.
The main spout has a curved lip to reduce dripping and connects to a handle that is comfortable and non-slip.  
A gasket is underneath where the jar comes into contact with the spout.  This provides a complete seal, so there is no leaking between the base of the spout and the top of the mason jar.  

 

 
 
 

 

The Ergo Spout could become your favorite kitchen tool because of its versatility.  Use it with pint jars to drizzle homemade salad dressings or breakfast syrups.  Add the Ergo Spout to a quart for easy pouring of juice or serving gravy to your crowd.  Attach one to your vintage half gallon jar to brew your sun tea or lemonade.

 

 

The Ergo Spout will be made of food-safe polypropylene, which is BPA and phthalates free.  The material provides the strength to lift heavy jars.  It will not warp in the high temperatures of the dishwasher and microwave.

 

 

 

The Ergo Spout solves three basic problems with Mason jars.  
First, because Mason jars are glass, they become slippery when wet.  With the Ergo Spout you can avoid those slippery jars and pour without the risk of dropping it.  
The Ergo Spout also allows the possibility of pouring hot liquids such as syrup.  Because your hand need not come in contact with the jar, you can safely pour that hot syrup on your pancakes.  
Last, the Ergo Spout prevents sticky drips down the side of the jar by guiding the liquid to the curved spout.  
The Ergo Spout makes for comfortable, safe pouring without the mess.

I'm a graphic designer living in Seattle with my husband and two kids, Stella and Stanley. Luv Chicken was created when the mother in me saw a need for a product that did not exist, and the designer in me knew I could be the one to create that product. So I did just that! Through tons of research and hard work, I've been able to build my dream business creating a product that fills a huge gap in the mainstream booster market.<p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/720015/files/20140715163722-problem.jpg?1405467442"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p><p>Every parent experiences the day when their child refuses to sit in their baby booster at the table. They really want to sit in their chair like a big kid, yet aren't quite tall enough to sit on an adult chair and properly reach the table. This can make for knee-sitting, squirmy, messiness at mealtime. Enter Luv Chicken™ boosters! </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/720018/files/20140715163818-product.jpg?1405467498"" src="""" style=""""/></p>These boosters give kids a 4"" boost so they can sit comfortably and squarely up to the table. The coated fabric is easy to wipe clean. The 15"" x 15"" booster covers the entire seat of the chair, protecting it from messy spills. The non-slip bottom keeps the booster in place without the use of clumsy buckles or ties. The handle makes the booster totally portable and easy to take anywhere like restaurants, movie theaters and outdoor sporting events. Best of all, kids really love them! These boosters not only look cool, they also foster independence and confidence during the transition from toddler to big kid.<p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy""

Luv Chicken was created when the mother in me saw a need for a product that did not exist, and the designer in me knew I could be the one to create that product. So I did just that! Through tons of research and hard work, I've been able to build my dream business creating a product that fills a huge gap in the mainstream booster market.Every parent experiences the day when their child refuses to sit in their baby booster at the table. They really want to sit in their chair like a big kid, yet aren't quite tall enough to sit on an adult chair and properly reach the table. This can make for knee-sitting, squirmy, messiness at mealtime. Enter Luv Chicken™ boosters! These boosters give kids a 4"" boost so they can sit comfortably and squarely up to the table. The coated fabric is easy to wipe clean. The 15"" x 15"" booster covers the entire seat of the chair, protecting it from messy spills. The non-slip bottom keeps the booster in place without the use of clumsy buckles or ties. The handle makes the booster totally portable and easy to take anywhere like restaurants, movie theaters and outdoor sporting events. Best of all, kids really love them! These boosters not only look cool, they also foster independence and confidence during the transition from toddler to big kid.                                                                                                                                    BabyCenter, Parents, US Weekly, Babyzone, Celebrity Baby Trends, SheKnows Parenting, Sweet Southern Lovin, Formula: Mom, ModernMom, SimplyStacie, New York Family, Pregnancy & Newborn, Scooter Traffic, CoolMomPicks, Seattle Magazine, The Little Style File, The Lavish Pear, Mogul BabyAside from the amazing write-ups in magazines and blogs, we've also won some honorable mentions and awards!Luv Chicken™ has been around for a little over 2 years. We have slowly been gaining momentum and listening to our customers very closely every step of the way. Now it's time to bring Luv Chicken to even more kids and make it a household name! We think every child between the ages of 2 and 8 should have a comfy booster to call their own, to foster independence and build confidence. We have received our first substantial retail order and want to begin mass-production to get Luv Chicken in stores nationwide, but we need your help.We have searched high and low for the right company to manufacture our product and have finally found them! We need $45,000 to begin large scale production so we can fulfill our first big retail order. These costs include:
Fabric design 
New retail packaging
Manufacturing 
Warehouse & fulfillment set-up
Initial legal & insurance fees
In return for your support, we are offering a number of fun Luv Chicken perks. We also have a cool Referral Contest we'll be running. You can win a $25 gift card each week from one of our favorite Seattle-based businesses - like Starbucks, Amazon, Nordstrom and zulily. Plus, the person with the most referrals at the end of our campaign will win a $100 Amazon gift card! Read more on our Referral Contest below. We are so excited about our product and want to share it with parents and kids everywhere! Your contribution will help make Luv Chicken™ a household name.

Features such as roads and rivers are converted into layers to create depth of the design. We use 3/32 inch (3mm) sheets of high-quality plywood, all of which are hand finished. Each layer is laser cut with a one hundredth of a millimeter precision and polished with sand paper to provide smooth clean surface. Wooden surface is finished with varnish to add color and material durability. Each map is unique due to the individual grain of the wood. All maps are assembled by hand with great attention to the creating process. </p><p>CityWood wall art is framed with wood and plexiglass for protection. </p><p><strong>CityWood elements:</strong></p><ul>

Features such as roads and rivers are converted into layers to create depth of the design. We use 3/32 inch (3mm) sheets of high-quality plywood, all of which are hand finished. Each layer is laser cut with a one hundredth of a millimeter precision and polished with sand paper to provide smooth clean surface. Wooden surface is finished with varnish to add color and material durability. Each map is unique due to the individual grain of the wood. All maps are assembled by hand with great attention to the creating process. CityWood wall art is framed with wood and plexiglass for protection. CityWood elements:
wooden frame
plexiglass
street layer
water layer
wooden background
The design is available in a number of dimensions: Desk Size: 5""x7"" (12x18 cm) Small Size: 11""x14"" (28x35 cm)Standard Size: 18""x18"" (45 x45 cm)  Medium Size: 24""x24"" (60x60 cm)  Large Size: 36""x36"" (90x90 cm) Add frame dimensions (1"" on each side) for final size.Frame colorYou can pick a frame color for your map: pinewood, walnut varnish, mahogany varnish, black stain. (if no frame color is picked we go with default: pinewood)Each art work is signed with its city name. Currently available cities: United States Albuquerque, Ann Arbor, Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Boston, Brisbane, Brisbane, Cincinnati, Charlotte, Charleston, Chicago, Cleveland, Columbus, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, El Paso, Fort Worth, Houston, Indianapolis, Jacksonville, Kansas City, Knoxville, Las Vegas, Long Beach, Los Angeles, Louisville, Madison, Mempis, Miami, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, New Orleans, New York, Oakland, Orlando, Palm Beach, Pasadena, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Portland, Providence, Richmond, Riverside, Sacramento, Salt Lake City, San Antonio, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, Santa Monica, Seattle, St Louis, St Paul, Tampa, Tucson, Washington, WellingtonCanada Calgary, Halifax, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Vancouver, Victoria  Europe Amsterdam, Athens, Barcelona, Basel, Bern, Bergen, Berlin, Bilbao, Brussels, Budapest , Cologne, Copenhagen, Dublin, Dusseldorf, Edinburgh, Florence, Frankfurt, Geneva, Glasgow, Gothenburg, Hamburg, Hanover, Helsinki, Lisbon, Liverpool, London, Lyon, Kraków, Kyiv, Madrid, Manchester, Munich, Nashville, Oslo, Paris, Porto, Prague, Reykjavik, Rome, Rotterdam, Sevilla, Stockholm, Stuttgart, Venice, Vienna, Warsaw, Zurich Asia & OceaniaAbu Dhabi, Auckland, Cairns, Canberra, Dubai, Doha, Hong Kong, Istanbul, Jerusalem, Kuala Lumpur, Kyoto, Melbourne, Moscow, Mumbai, New Delhi, Osaka, Perth, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, St Petersburg, Sydney, Taipei, Tel Aviv, Tokyo Americas Bogota, Buonos Aires, Havana, Mexico City, Rio de Janeiro, Santiago, Santo DomingoAfricaCape TownCurrent City List (alphabetical order): Abu Dhabi Wooden MapAlbuquerque Wooden MapAmsterdam Wooden MapAnn Arbor Wooden MapAthens Wooden MapAtlanta Wooden MapAuckland Wooden MapAustin Wooden MapBaltimore Wooden MapBarcelona Wooden MapBasel Wooden MapBergen Wooden MapBerlin Wooden MapBern Wooden MapBilbao Wooden MapBogota Wooden MapBoston Wooden MapBrisbane Wooden MapBrussels Wooden MapBudapest Wooden MapBuenos Aires Wooden MapCairns Wooden MapCalgary Wooden MapCanberra Wooden MapCape Town Wooden MapCharleston Wooden MapCharlotte Wooden MapChicago Wooden MapCincinnati Wooden MapCleveland Wooden MapCologne Wooden MapColumbus Wooden MapCopenhagen Wooden MapDallas Wooden MapDenver Wooden MapDetroit Wooden MapDoha Wooden MapDubai Wooden MapDublin Wooden MapDusseldorf Wooden MapEdinburgh Wooden MapEl Paso Wooden MapFlorence Wooden MapFort Worth Wooden MapFrankfurt Wooden MapGeneva Wooden MapGlasgow Wooden MapGothenburg Wooden MapHalifax Wooden MapHamburg Wooden MapHanover Wooden MapHavana Wooden MapHelsinki Wooden MapHong Kong Wooden MapHouston Wooden MapIndianapolis Wooden MapIstanbul Wooden MapJacksonville Wooden MapJerusalem Wooden MapKansas City Wooden MapKnoxville Wooden MapKrakow Wooden MapKuala Lumpur Wooden MapKyiv Wooden MapKyoto Wooden MapLas Vegas Wooden MapLisbon Wooden MapLiverpool Wooden MapLondon Wooden MapLong Beach Wooden MapLos Angeles Wooden MapLouisville Wooden MapLyon Wooden MapMadison Wooden MapMadrid Wooden MapManchester Wooden MapMelbourne Wooden MapMemphis Wooden MapMexico City Wooden MapMiami Wooden MapMilwaukee Wooden MapMinneapolis Wooden MapMontreal Wooden MapMoscow Wooden MapMumbai Wooden MapMunich Wooden MapNashville Wooden MapNew Delhi Wooden MapNew Orleans Wooden MapNew York Wooden MapOakland Wooden MapOrlando Wooden MapOsaka Wooden MapOslo Wooden MapOttawa Wooden MapPalm Beach Wooden MapParis Wooden MapPasadena Wooden MapPerth Wooden MapPhiladelphia Wooden MapPhoenix Wooden MapPittsburgh Wooden MapPortland Wooden MapPorto Wooden MapPrague Wooden MapProvidence Wooden MapReykjavik Wooden MapRichmond Wooden MapRio de Janeiro Wooden MapRiverside Wooden MapRome Wooden MapRotterdam Wooden MapSacramento Wooden MapSalt Lake City Wooden MapSan Antonio Wooden MapSan Diego Wooden MapSan Francisco Wooden MapSan Jose Wooden MapSanta Monica Wooden MapSantiago Wooden MapSanto Domingo Wooden MapSeattle Wooden MapSeoul Wooden MapSeville Wooden MapShanghai Wooden MapSingapore Wooden MapSt Louis Wooden MapStockholm Wooden MapSt Paul Wooden MapSt Petersburg Wooden MapStuttgart Wooden MapSydney Wooden MapTaipei Wooden MapTampa Wooden MapTel Aviv Wooden MapTokyo Wooden MapToronto Wooden MapTucson Wooden MapVancouver Wooden MapVenice Wooden MapVictoria Wooden MapVienna Wooden MapWarsaw Wooden MapWashington Wooden MapWellington Wooden MapZurich Wooden Map Stretch Goals. We would like to add new cities based on request and project scale:Reached! 5 000 US$ -

ADJUSTABLE. ALL-PURPOSE. Botto Design presents the “½ (One-half) Smart Storage System” – the most satisfying storage container ever.  BREAKING NEWS: 2018 HOUSEWARES DESIGN AWARDS “BEST IN CATEGORY” WINNERBotto Design’s ½ Smart Storage System was awarded the “Best in Category” of Countertop Kitchenware of 2018 Housewares Design Awards. Among other finalists were big brands such as OXO, Cole & Mason (DKB), Mason Cash (Typhoon) and Architec Brands. They did beautiful jobs. But as the judges commented, “Botto Design did better.”The Housewares Design Awards is the most prestigious design award program focused on housewares design innovation. Founded by HomeWorld Business, it is dubbed as the “Academy Awards” in the industry. ""Best in Category"" of Countertop Kitchenware, 2018 Housewares Design Awards BREAKING NEWS: ASIA DESIGN PRIZE 2018 WINNERBotto Design’s ½ Smart Storage System was awarded the Winner of Asia Design Prize 2018, one of the most famous design awards in South Korea.Winner of Asia Design Prize 2018 BACKGROUNDWe all like our home neat and tidy. But to keep things organized is usually a tedious and an endless work.Nowadays we can buy almost everything online. Life is getting easier, and we keep more stuff at home.Our living standards have never been higher, but the way how we organize our belongings has not improved significantly.  Never wastes your space (and food) again! As a product designer and an interior designer, Terence has seen a lot of beautiful homes in perfect condition. But most of them share the same problem.Their pantries, cabinets, and even countertops are terribly chaotic. They are in a total mess. Either no storage container is used at all, or more oftentimes than not, no SUITABLE storage container is being used.Case Study #1: Kitchen Cabinets. Brooklyn, New York. Wrong storage containers trap excess air that spoils the food. Space is also lost because most containers are not fully filled. You might have a gorgeous pantry shelf, but you might be actually wasting your space, your food, and your money.Case Study #2: Built-in Storage. Richmond, California. Never before did we take the problem seriously. What can we do?We believe, every problem comes with a solution. THE SOLUTIONWith this in mind, Botto Design introduces the “½ (One-half) Smart Storage System” – the most satisfying canister in the world.Maximizes your space. WHAT IS THE ½ SMART STORAGE SYSTEM?The ½ Smart Storage System is functional and easy to use. Just open the lid, fill the container with food, close the lid, and press it down. What you get is a larger storage capacity but with less air inside.Freely adjustable volume from 16 oz to 32 oz. Nothing can do a better job than the one-way check valve to force the air out. No electricity needed! Just push it down! 100% clarity from all angles. Perfect for storing coffee beans .A simple design but with smart functions. The production tooling is ready. We’ve done a small-scale production run. We can go ahead with mass production anytime. But we want to give you the Kickstarter-exclusive offers before we officially launch the product in the mass market.This is one of the toolings. We are ready to start the production. A newborn baby. And her mother (the tooling). WHAT MAKES THE ½ SMART STORAGE SYSTEM SO SPECIAL? 1. ADJUSTABLE16 oz, 17 oz, 18 oz, ... all the way up to 32 oz. Or vice versa!  Pull it up or push it down as you wish You can adjust the height by pulling up or pushing down the container to get different storage volumes. For instance, if you want to store 24 oz. of cereal, just extend the container to the fullest, pour the cereal inside, then close the lid, and press down the container. Excess air is forced out and the lid will stop at the top surface of the content. The space inside the container is better utilized.  2. FRESH-KEEPINGLess air keeps your food fresh longer.The ½ Smart Storage System has a patented one-way check-valve to release the excess air from the inside. When you compress the container, air goes out from the valve. No air can sneak in from there. Much less air is left in the container and it helps keep the food stay fresh longer. Good for storing a wide variety of perishable foods including cereal, coffee beans, sugar, salt, snacks, pasta, grains, and even pet food! 3. FLEXIBLEFlexibility is the keyMakes all your space come alive again. Changeable heights let you fill up the space that was not being wisely used before. Pull up or push down the body to get the height that fits the empty space. Storage capacity is maximized significantly. The ½ Smart Storage System does a beautiful job of keeping things contained and organized! 4. VISIBLE100% transparencyThe main body of the container is made of crystal clear transparent plastic. 360-degree clarity helps you get the right one instantly. You can also stack the ½ Smart Storage System vertically and make the most out of your precious space. Our modular design makes sure the containers won’t slide off even you pile them up as long as they are placed on a flat and steady surface. It is so much easier to keep your countertop, pantry, bathroom, garage and office organized. 5. FOOD-SAFEMade of food-safe materialThe ½ Smart Storage System is constructed of US FDA-grade, food-safe, BPA-free, phthalate-free and toxic-free materials. The lid is made of polypropylene provided by Sumitomo, one of the largest worldwide conglomerates from Japan. Polypropylene has good chemical resistance over stains and odors. The gaskets are made of silicone that forms tight seals. The body is Styrene-Acrylonitrile Resin which provides the rigidity and transparency. The ½ Smart Storage System is produced by the same manufacturer who makes environmentally-friendly reusable drinkware for Starbucks Corporation. 6. DURABLETest. Test. Test.We are very serious about the quality of our products. We inspect our products according to the ANSI/ASQ Quality Control Standards: Z1.4, the same system employed by the U.S. Department of Defense. Every single piece of the ½ Smart Storage System is made to last. We offer limited lifetime warranty on wearable and replaceable parts. 7. DESIGNED IN AMERICAOur blood and sweat...After two years of research and development, we found the best solution. Different sizes, materials, colors, structures, and capacities were tested.All the product design, engineering and development are done by Botto Design in the United States. We partner with a reliable manufacturer in China to handle the production. Our representative office in Hong Kong communicates with the manufacturer every day to make sure the production, quality control and delivery are going according to schedule. 8. WE ARE READYThe tooling is made. Manufacturing costs are fully priced. Production will start soon. No more surprises, uncertainty and excuses. We plan to ship out the first batch of the ½ Smart Storage System from Hong Kong by July 2018.  The ½ Smart Storage System is made with love by Terence, Anthony, Clara and Kan (from left to right).Our lil' kitten loves it too...

<h1>Who are we: </h1>
<p>We are Coocepts, a group of people who are big fans of the moon and we always dream to catch the moon in the sky. About A year ago, we created our first portable moon light. With the latest 3D printing technology, we are able to create a sphere without any injection gate on the surface. We also place the charging plug and function button to the bottom of the moon light to minimal the affect of the outlook of the moon light.</p>

<h1>What we are going to do in this project:   </h1>
<p>Although we are very happy to see our first version of the moon light is so popular in the market. But we are still feeling that there are something missing. After our research on the feedback of our customers, we finally found out what it is missing and this is why we create this project.</p>

<h1>What the first version Moon Light is missing: </h1>

<h1>How does the Wireless Charging Levitating Moon Light Works:</h1>
<p>There will be one touchable button at the bottom of the moon light and one switch on the docking. They will bring the moon light to different light mode with different combinations.</p>
<h1>Levitating Mode:</h1>
<p>Night light mode: By switching on the docking station and keep the moon light to the off status. Place the moon light to the docking and moon light will be turned on automatically. The brightness of the moon light will stay on at 0.1w and it will not discharge the battery.</p>
<p>Battery mode with cold white light: One touch to the touchable button on the moon while levitating. Then long press to adjust the brightness from 0.1w to 1.5w. Working hours will be 10 - 100 hours depends on the brightness.</p>
<p>Battery mode with warm yellow light: One touch again to the touchable button on the moon while levitating. Then long press to adjust the brightness from 0.1w to 1.5w. Working hours will be 10 - 100 hours depends on the brightness.</p>
<p>If you touch the touchable button again it will back to the night light mode.</p>
<h1>Portable Light Mode:</h1>
<p>Portable mode with cold white light: One touch to the touchable button on the moon. Then long press to adjust the brightness from 0.1w to 1.5w. Working hours will be 10 - 100 hours depends on the brightness.</p>
<p>Portable mode with warm yellow light: One touch again to the touchable button on the moon. Then long press to adjust the brightness from 0.1w to 1.5w. Working hours will be 10 - 100 hours depends on the brightness.</p>
<p>If you touch the touchable button again it will turn the moon light off.</p>
<h1>Charging Mode:</h1>
<p>By switching off the docking and place the moon light with the off status, it will charge the moon light. A full charge will take around 2 hours.</p>

<h1>Why we need you in this project:</h1>
<p>As big fans of the moon, we need to gain your support in order to continuous our journey. We would like to know that we are making something that people around the world are also exciting to see it's happening. Your support makes this project worthy of spending all our time on bringing this perfect moon light to life. Thank you very much for listening to our story. Please support this project and help us to bring this moon light to live.</p>
</div></div>","Who are we: 
We are Coocepts, a group of people who are big fans of the moon and we always dream to catch the moon in the sky. About A year ago, we created our first portable moon light. With the latest 3D printing technology, we are able to create a sphere without any injection gate on the surface. We also place the charging plug and function button to the bottom of the moon light to minimal the affect of the outlook of the moon light.

What we are going to do in this project:   
Although we are very happy to see our first version of the moon light is so popular in the market. But we are still feeling that there are something missing. After our research on the feedback of our customers, we finally found out what it is missing and this is why we create this project.

What the first version Moon Light is missing: 
The moon always floats in the middle of the sky, so we would like to see our moon light floating in the air too. Implementing the levitate device into our moon light give a totally different atmosphere to the scene which bring our moon light to the next level.
This is a working prototype of our floating moon light. The docking will be made of wood in our final production.
The different between our first version and the new version: 
1) Redesign the charging port and the color changing and dimmable button
In order to implement the levitate module into the moon light, we need to redesign the panel on the bottom of our moon light in order to put the whole module into the moon without affecting the out look of the light.
The one on the left is the redesigned version of our new levitating moon light. We have created a much small switch to control the color and the brightness of the light
2) The levitating docking 
After months researching about the levitating docking, we have implement strong Neodymium magnets to increase the stability of the floating of the moon and also to increase the ease of the operation in levitation. The docking station also provide wireless charging to the moon light.
The final version of the docking will be made of wood.
How does the Wireless Charging Levitating Moon Light Works:
There will be one touchable button at the bottom of the moon light and one switch on the docking. They will bring the moon light to different light mode with different combinations.
Levitating Mode:
Night light mode: By switching on the docking station and keep the moon light to the off status. Place the moon light to the docking and moon light will be turned on automatically. The brightness of the moon light will stay on at 0.1w and it will not discharge the battery.
Battery mode with cold white light: One touch to the touchable button on the moon while levitating. Then long press to adjust the brightness from 0.1w to 1.5w. Working hours will be 10 - 100 hours depends on the brightness.
Battery mode with warm yellow light: One touch again to the touchable button on the moon while levitating. Then long press to adjust the brightness from 0.1w to 1.5w. Working hours will be 10 - 100 hours depends on the brightness.
If you touch the touchable button again it will back to the night light mode.
Portable Light Mode:
Portable mode with cold white light: One touch to the touchable button on the moon. Then long press to adjust the brightness from 0.1w to 1.5w. Working hours will be 10 - 100 hours depends on the brightness.
Portable mode with warm yellow light: One touch again to the touchable button on the moon. Then long press to adjust the brightness from 0.1w to 1.5w. Working hours will be 10 - 100 hours depends on the brightness.
If you touch the touchable button again it will turn the moon light off.
Charging Mode:
By switching off the docking and place the moon light with the off status, it will charge the moon light. A full charge will take around 2 hours.

<p><strong>QitaWear Helmets</strong></p>
<p>Hi, my name is Juan</p>
<p>For over three years, individual customers have been demanding my hand made night-glow helmets. Aside from wearing a helmet Tron would be proud to ride with, my hand-made designs have an appeal that combine future-fashion with ultra-high visibility to usher in the safest era of night riding.</p>
<p>I have created a company called QitaWear and am now prepared to mass produce our QitaWear helmets and bring them to a national market. We are raising funds to produce the molds needed to scale this exciting and growing business.  Molds will use and have:<br/> 1.Quad Inmold Technology <br/> 2.High Density EPS Liner <br/> 3.Polycarbonate Shell</p>
<p> This is why I turned to indiegogo so we together can make the biking and active lifestyle safer when out at dusk or night.  </p>
<p>Because molding for mass production is very expensive we are going to go with two model molds to start with. A sports style bike helmet called the QS-1, and the bicycle style helmet called the QB-1. There are many more designs for the future but for now we will take it one step at a time and go wih the two models. One great customization is you get to choose the color lighting you would like on your helmet. There are 10 choices for both the QitaWear Helmets and bike glow kits depending on perks. All our funding will go into the production of our helmets and QitaWear Ultra High Visibility Belts. If anything is left we have many more fashion lines in Qita sports and active wear apparel to apply any leftover funds to.</p>
<p><strong>IMPACT</strong></p>
<p>Bike lights tend to only give light in the direction your light is facing.  This includes helmet lights and bike lights.  QitaWear bike helmets are designs so you have a full 360 degree of lighting spotted from all angles.  The biking community needs a signature system.  Bike lights and reflective elastic just do not cut it.   Our unique helmets for one, make you be seen before the bike.  Second, create a lot of attention and wonder usually forcing people to slow down out of curiosity.  And three, they are just plain fun and cool.</p>
<p>For myself the only time I have for an active lifestyle is early morning or late night, both as equally dark to be out on the road running, walking the dog, or biking.  I have been on both sides of the spectrum with biking, and do not want to be hit by a vehicle or hit someone with my vehicle.  At times I even surprise myself when all of a sudden the siliote of a bicyclist or walker is 10 feet in front of my moving vehicle.   We all know the risks but people still take them, because in reality who really wants to wear a big yellow reflective stylish vest!</p>
<p>  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</strong></p>
<p>Because we are going with a manufacturer to build our molds there may still be risks with a large order. There could be some unforeseen manufacturing delays or quality issues that arise during production of larger batches.  Designs also may have some changes to it for fitting and safety of the helmet.  Also not raising enough funding to complete both molds could cause us to only produce one style helmet to start.  To the extent unforeseen delays arise, QitaWear will do its best efforts to minimize such delays.  We are giving a date further than is expected completion to keep all the unforeseen risks at a minimum with  our perks rewards and QitaWear QS-1, QB-1 Helmets.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>QitaWear helmets will not make you invincible. So please keep do not ride more dangerously or take more risks on the road. </p>
<p>Thanks you for your time and hope you decide to join me in changing the future of the biking communities. Cars still have blind spots and people still do not pay attention when driving or texting while driving.   Be Safe, Be Seen!! </p>

<p>In the aftermath of the Sri Lankan Civil War, in a small predominantly Tamil community close to Jaffna, three sisters and their mother live in a small, shelled house. Three years before, their father and their only source of income passed away. During the crisis, the house was shelled and only three rooms remain. Half of the house is gone, most of the family sleeps on the floor. There are no fans to save them from the notorious Sri Lankan heat. The sisters are 20, 22, and 24. The 20 year old aspires to go to college since the war and father's illness held up the other sisters' chances. The 22 year old is the only current source of income, making only the equivalent of $80 US dollars a month. The 24 year old had a job, but was laid off last year and is now looking for a job.

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p><strong>What’s the volumes of teapot and the cup？</strong></p>
<p>The volume of cup is 30ml，teapot is 150ml.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What’s the material of the staff in the gift box and the package？</strong></p>
<p>The spoon is made of copper,the plate is made of bamboo;the main materials of towel is cotton and bast fibre. And the materials of our packaging are paper and EVA foam(an environmental-friendly material).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Is the material safe？</strong></p>
<p>We did tons of research and talked with crafters before the starting point of our project to make sure our Yixing Clay is qualified for daily use. For further considerations, we have asked our supplier to apply for quality inspection through official departments. It will take several weeks to get the result. We will let every our supporter know when the report comes out.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How to clean or maintain HEI？</strong></p>
<p>Our HEI is designed to be cleaning friendly. You will find assemble or disassemble it is just as simple as playing Lego game. Each part could be separated, which will make the cleaning very convenient and easy. There is no special caring need for HEI. However, it will keep a better quality by following tips below：</p>
<p>1. Rinse HEI by using hot water before your tea ceremony for hygiene concern</p>
<p>2. Clean HEI by using cotton material</p>
<p>3. Store HEI under dry conditions</p>
<p>4. Avoid from oily substance</p>
<p>5. No dishwasher</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What’s the maintenance between stainless and copper version？</strong></p>
<p>The only difference between Copper Version and HEI is its material used for thermometer. The part of thermometer in water （include tea infuser）will continuously use the food graded -304 stainless steel. Another part of thermometer outside on the surface will be crafted by using brass. Therefore, the maintenance will be very similar for these two choices.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Is the Yixing clay specified for a certain kind of tea？</strong></p>
<p>1. Yixing Clay is not specified for a certain kind of tea based on our research for its history. If you have interests to brew various kinds of tea, make sure to clean up by using hot water before using HEI every time.</p>
<p>2. For those who have strong interest in tea culture, our advice is to use one teapot for one kind of tea for spirit experience.</p>
<p>Generally, you can use HEI to brew tea based on your personal favor.</p>

1. Rinse HEI by using hot water before your tea ceremony for hygiene concern
2. Clean HEI by using cotton material
3. Store HEI under dry conditions
4. Avoid from oily substance
5. No dishwasher
 
What’s the maintenance between stainless and copper version？
The only difference between Copper Version and HEI is its material used for thermometer. The part of thermometer in water （include tea infuser）will continuously use the food graded -304 stainless steel. Another part of thermometer outside on the surface will be crafted by using brass. Therefore, the maintenance will be very similar for these two choices.
 
Is the Yixing clay specified for a certain kind of tea？
1. Yixing Clay is not specified for a certain kind of tea based on our research for its history. If you have interests to brew various kinds of tea, make sure to clean up by using hot water before using HEI every time.
2. For those who have strong interest in tea culture, our advice is to use one teapot for one kind of tea for spirit experience.
Generally, you can use HEI to brew tea based on your personal favor.",16.0,3,"1 Campaign

The Impact
 

This project is going to have a profound impact on the lives of the refugees who receive a tiny house they can call their own. Transportable, it will be a welcoming first-step to America. It's also a first step in developing my approach to environmentally friendly construction -- work I hope to continue after school.
I know from raising money for my brother when he was sick, how effective these crowd funding campaigns can be. I know from building the gazebo how satisfying it is to create something beautiful and functional from the ground up.
I have the design faculty at Hampshire College committed and engaged in this project. They will be there with me every step of the way. I've spoken with the head of the Ascentria Care Alliance office in Westfield, and they are very excited to receive this house and give it to a family in need.


 
Risks & Challenges
 

Time is a challenge when committing to a project of this magnitude.
That's why I'm dedicating an entire year, with two semesters and a summer in between to complete this project.

<p>Dustin Jefferson Onghanseng and Brian Lin both share a passion for health and sustainability. When they met, they both had chronic breathing conditions, rhinitis and asthma, respectively. Realizing they could put their passions to good use and solve some major health problems, they used a 24-hour hackathon to build their first Indoor Air Quality Sensor. They won the hackathon, turned it into a startup and are now on a mission to help people live healthier lives.</p>

<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;""><b>What is uHoo?</b></span></td>
<td>uHoo is the most advanced air quality sensor in the world. With eight dedicated sensors, uHoo provides allergen and toxin alerts for air quality in the home and office.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""color: #363636;font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-weight: 100;""><b>How does uHoo work?</b></span></td>
<td>You simply plug it to a power outlet, set up a user account on your smartphone and uHoo does the rest. It delivers real time minute-by-minute data to your smartphone which can be stored safely in an encrypted space in the cloud. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;""><b>How will this benefit me?</b></span></td>
<td>Knowing the quality of air you breathe helps you make better decisions on the products you use and your habits so you can live a healthier life. Conditions like asthma, hay fever and allergies are triggered by allergens and toxins that are present in the air that you breathe. With uHoo, you would know what is in the air you breathe. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""color: #363636;font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-weight: 100;""><b>What’s the main difference between uHoo and competing products?</b></span></td>
<td>Other air detectors on the market tend to focus on only a select few air quality indicators. uHoo’s technology is the most advanced, with eight dedicated sensors built in to an aesthetically beautiful product that is around the size of a soda can. uHoo detects more chemicals, particles and toxins than any other air detector.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""color: #363636;font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-weight: 100;""><b>What is the difference between uHoo Classic and uHoo Premium?</b></span></td>
<td>The key difference between the Classic and Premium is the number of sensors. The Classic has five sensors - Temperature, Humidity, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), PM 2.5 (Dust) and Air Pressure. The Premium has all the sensors that the Classic has plus three more - Carbon Monoxide, Carbon Dioxide and Ozone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""color: #363636;font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-weight: 100;""><span><b>How much does uHoo cost?</b></span></span></td>
<td>Those who pre-order during the Indiegogo campaign can get the uHoo Classic at a 50% discount for only $99 and get the uHoo Premium at a 40% discount for only $149.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""color: #363636;font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-weight: 100;""><b>What comes in the box?</b></span></td>
<td>The package for both versions include the uHoo device, a micro-USB cable, a power adapter and the free smartphone app that you can download on the Apple Store or Play Store.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""color: #363636;font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-weight: 100;""><span><b>What mobile support do you provide?</b></span></span></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""color: #363636;font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-weight: 100;""><b>How can I track my health?</b></span></td>
<td>Sufferers of asthma and allergies can take it a step further by using the Health Diary. You can record information about how you are feeling at any given time and how it may correspond to the air quality of the room you’re in. You can also set up personalized alerts so you stay ahead of the curve.</td>

<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""color: #363636;font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-weight: 100;""><b>What’s your privacy policy?</b></span></td>

<td>uHoo is small and lightweight, making it easy to carry with you wherever you go. It weighs only 200 grams and is only 6.2 inches tall and 3.3 inches in diameter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""color: #363636;font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-weight: 100;""><span><b>Why do I need to be notified when I’m not at home?</b></span></span></td>
<td>It’s important to know when there’s a sudden gas leak or when the temperature suddenly rises - such as when there’s a fire, for example. That way, you can immediately act and not be caught off guard when it’s too late. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""color: #363636;font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-weight: 100;""><span><b>How easy is it to read the information?</b></span></span></td>
<td>The alerts and messages are written in simple everyday language so it would be easy for you to understand. Each sensor is also color coded based on what it detects. Green is good, yellow is still alright, while red is unhealthy. You have the option to view each data point in more detail. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""color: #363636;font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-weight: 100;""><b>Does it make any noise?</b></span></td>

<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""color: #363636;font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-weight: 100;""><span><b>Will this system be able to monitor the whole house, or would I need to purchase multiple sensors for a two-level home?</b></span></span></td>
<td>How air flows inside your home is dependent on its design. Doors, walls and partitions restrict the flow of air, thus the air in one room will be different from another if the doors are constantly kept closed. The air on one floor in your home would probably be different from another level. It is best to place uHoo in the area of your home where most people spend their time in because that’s what matters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""color: #363636;font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-weight: 100;""><b>Can it prepare reports to be given to my doctor or allergist?</b></span></td>
<td>You would be able to show your doctor or allergist your indoor air quality information as well as your Health Diary. These are designed to be easily readable and referenced at any time. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""color: #363636;font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-weight: 100;""><span><b>Can this product relate to a person personally, by letting you know if you have an allergy?</b></span></span></td>
<td>Since different people have different tolerance levels for different allergens and toxins uHoo allows you to set your tolerance levels on when you want to be alerted. </td>

uHoo is dedicated to providing people with technology to understand the air they breathe and empower them with knowledge to create a healthier home and office environment.

Dustin Jefferson Onghanseng and Brian Lin both share a passion for health and sustainability. When they met, they both had chronic breathing conditions, rhinitis and asthma, respectively. Realizing they could put their passions to good use and solve some major health problems, they used a 24-hour hackathon to build their first Indoor Air Quality Sensor. They won the hackathon, turned it into a startup and are now on a mission to help people live healthier lives.

What is uHoo?
uHoo is the most advanced air quality sensor in the world. With eight dedicated sensors, uHoo provides allergen and toxin alerts for air quality in the home and office.


How does uHoo work?
You simply plug it to a power outlet, set up a user account on your smartphone and uHoo does the rest. It delivers real time minute-by-minute data to your smartphone which can be stored safely in an encrypted space in the cloud. 


How will this benefit me?
Knowing the quality of air you breathe helps you make better decisions on the products you use and your habits so you can live a healthier life. Conditions like asthma, hay fever and allergies are triggered by allergens and toxins that are present in the air that you breathe. With uHoo, you would know what is in the air you breathe. 


What’s the main difference between uHoo and competing products?
Other air detectors on the market tend to focus on only a select few air quality indicators. uHoo’s technology is the most advanced, with eight dedicated sensors built in to an aesthetically beautiful product that is around the size of a soda can. uHoo detects more chemicals, particles and toxins than any other air detector.


What is the difference between uHoo Classic and uHoo Premium?
The key difference between the Classic and Premium is the number of sensors. The Classic has five sensors - Temperature, Humidity, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), PM 2.5 (Dust) and Air Pressure. The Premium has all the sensors that the Classic has plus three more - Carbon Monoxide, Carbon Dioxide and Ozone.


How much does uHoo cost?
Those who pre-order during the Indiegogo campaign can get the uHoo Classic at a 50% discount for only $99 and get the uHoo Premium at a 40% discount for only $149.


What comes in the box?
The package for both versions include the uHoo device, a micro-USB cable, a power adapter and the free smartphone app that you can download on the Apple Store or Play Store.


What mobile support do you provide?
The uHoo app is available for both iPhone and Android and can be downloaded for free.


How can I track my health?
Sufferers of asthma and allergies can take it a step further by using the Health Diary. You can record information about how you are feeling at any given time and how it may correspond to the air quality of the room you’re in. You can also set up personalized alerts so you stay ahead of the curve.


What’s your privacy policy?
Your data is safely stored in our cloud servers and we do not use your data for marketing or other purposes. Your privacy is important to us, so we respect your wish to keep it private or you can choose to share it and with whom.


How portable is uHoo and can I travel with it?
uHoo is small and lightweight, making it easy to carry with you wherever you go. It weighs only 200 grams and is only 6.2 inches tall and 3.3 inches in diameter.


Why do I need to be notified when I’m not at home?
It’s important to know when there’s a sudden gas leak or when the temperature suddenly rises - such as when there’s a fire, for example. That way, you can immediately act and not be caught off guard when it’s too late. 


How easy is it to read the information?
The alerts and messages are written in simple everyday language so it would be easy for you to understand. Each sensor is also color coded based on what it detects. Green is good, yellow is still alright, while red is unhealthy. You have the option to view each data point in more detail. 


Does it make any noise?
No. uHoo does not make any sound at all. 


Will this system be able to monitor the whole house, or would I need to purchase multiple sensors for a two-level home?
How air flows inside your home is dependent on its design. Doors, walls and partitions restrict the flow of air, thus the air in one room will be different from another if the doors are constantly kept closed. The air on one floor in your home would probably be different from another level. It is best to place uHoo in the area of your home where most people spend their time in because that’s what matters.


Can it prepare reports to be given to my doctor or allergist?
You would be able to show your doctor or allergist your indoor air quality information as well as your Health Diary. These are designed to be easily readable and referenced at any time. 


Can this product relate to a person personally, by letting you know if you have an allergy?
Since different people have different tolerance levels for different allergens and toxins uHoo allows you to set your tolerance levels on when you want to be alerted. 


 



What types of sensors does uHoo have?
With eight dedicated sensors, uHoo is the most comprehensive air quality sensor in the market. uHoo has sensors for Temperature, Humidity, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), PM 2.5 (Dust), Air Pressure, Carbon Monoxide, Carbon Dioxide and Ozone.


What are the dimensions and weight?
uHoo is small and lightweight, so easy to carry with you wherever you go. It weighs only 200 grams and is only 6.2 inches tall and 3.3 inches in diameter.


Is it customizable so you could focus on the metrics most important to you?
Yes, you can customize each air quality metric based on your own tolerance level. That way you get alerts that are more personalized and catered to you.


Does it have a filter to clean the air?
uHoo does not filter the air, but provides you with the data you need to make the changes that matter. When you receive an alert about the air quality, the uHoo app will also automatically provide recommendations on what you can do at that moment for better air quality. The data that uHoo provides enables you to make healthy changes.


Does uHoo have a battery?
uHoo does not have a battery. It just needs to be plugged into a power outlet.


Will it alert me to precisely what is wrong with the air quality, not just that it's bad?
Yes, uHoo will tell you exactly which type of air quality parameter is unhealthy.


Can it be expanded to check for additional allergens and toxins?
As of today, uHoo has eight dedicated sensors and can monitor various allergens and toxins. As we progress and build uHoo’s technology, we will be able to incorporate more detection and monitoring capabilities.


Where do I place uHoo in my home or office?
uHoo will work in all indoor environments. You can put uHoo anywhere in your home as long as you avoid these locations: under direct sunlight, in front of a blowing air-conditioner or fan, beside your cooking stove or heater or any equipment that emits heat or cold air


Can the device monitor air quality and toxicity for different areas/rooms in my home?
Yes, uHoo can monitor air quality and toxicity for different areas / rooms in your home. You have the option of leaving it in one room or you can bring it to another room. Alternatively, if you want to constantly monitor multiple rooms, you can also get a device for every room and you’d be able to have an air quality map of your home, which you would be able to see on the uHoo app.


How big of an area can uHoo cover?
Air flows and it depends on the design of your home or office. In a completely open space, uHoo can cover approximately 400 square feet.


Can uHoo check for smoke too?
Yes, uHoo can check for smoke too.


How many people can be notified at a time?
You can set uHoo to notify as many people as you want. Your family members can also download the uHoo app and add the device(s) you have at home into their uHoo account. You can set this within the uHoo app for every device that you have.


Does it have options to graph air quality over a period time for comparison?
Yes, you would be able to see charts on how your indoor air quality changes over time. You can view it by hour, by day, by week or by month.


What kind of maintenance does uHoo require?
uHoo doesn’t need any maintenance. All you need to do is wipe it with a cloth or feather duster when you clean your home or office.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">About GRAYL</h2>
<p></p>
<p>GRAYL, Inc.is a woman owned, Seattle-based startup founded in 2012. We make innovative, beautifully designed products that contribute to a health lifestyle and clean environment. GRAYL is designed for busy people who care deeply about both what they put in their bodies and their footprint on earth. </p>
<p>GRAYL was inspired by founder Nancie Weston's concerns about the quality and taste of the tap water she drank at home and, especially, during her business travels.  She no longer wanted to contribute to the environmental impact made by disposable water bottles. She set out to create a device that not only made water safe and taste great, but also that was beautifully designed and made with the highest quality materials. So Nancie invested her life savings, put together a team of dedicated people and 18 months later, GRAYL is ready to launch. </p>

<h3>GRAYL FAQs:</h3>
<h4>Earlybird Color Selection: </h4>
<p>Please put the color choice in the Address Line 2 spot.  If you do not give us a color choice we will contact you to get one when the campaign is done. </p>
<h4>I want to buy two or more GRAYLs...</h4>
<p>You will have to order them individually, however we can ship them together, so you only have to pay for shipping one time.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Isn't tap water good enough? Which impurities are the GRAYL G3+ Filter and G3+ Purifier effective against?</h4>
<p>Both the G3+ Filter and Purifier are effective against a broad range of impurities. They greatly reduce impurities that make water taste and smell bad, like chlorine, certain industrial and pharmaceutical chemicals and certain heavy metals commonly found in tap water. The G3+ Filters removes 99.99% of bacteria, such as E. coli, found when municipal water systems fail. The G3+ Purifier provides a higher level of protection, removing 99.999% of bacteria, cysts (Giardia) and viruses (Hepatitis A). Tests were completed by a certified, independent laboratory according to NSF/ANSI standards 42 and 53.</p>
<h4>What is the difference between the G3+ Filter and G3+ Purifier?</h4>
<p>The primary difference is that the Purifier has two layers of filter media, the Filter has one. The Filter is sufficient for most people in the US. The Filter strips water of nasty chemicals flavors and odors and filters the bacteria common when municipal water systems fail like E. Coli. The Purifier does everything the Filter does, and adds protection against cysts (Giardia) and viruses - Hepatitis A, SARS, etc. The Purifier needs longer to extract viruses from the water, so it takes about 30 seconds to filter one Water Filtration Cup (16oz - 475ml).</p>
<h4>What is the pore size (microns) of the G3+ technology?</h4>
<p>Pore size is not relevant to G3+ technology; it's like asking how much horsepower a laptop computer has. Pore size is relevant in 'mechanical filters', which work by forcing water through tiny pores in a filter. In a mechanical filter, the biggest pore must be smaller than the smallest germ. The downside of mechanical filters is that tiny pores prevent rapid flow of water, so mechanical filters work slowly or require lots of pressure. Instead, G3+ technology uses electroadsorption; relatively large pores overlaid with a positively-charged mesh (think: little magnets) that latch onto germs. The result is fast-flowing, clean water so you can Drink Freely.</p>
<h4>How long does a filter last?</h4>
<p>The replaceable G3+ Filter and Purifier have a lifespan of 300 uses (40gallons or 150L) - about 3 uses per day for 3 months. The Filter should definitely be replaced after 300 uses because its effectiveness declines after 300 uses. Replacement filters are available wherever GRAYL is sold, and through our website.</p>
<h4>What is 18/8 Stainless Steel?</h4>
<p>18/8 refers to the steel containing 18% chromium and 8% nickel. The rest is mostly iron. 18/8 stainless steel is a strong, corrosion resistant metal that we chose specifically for GRAYL. 18/8 stainless steel doesn't leach BPA or other chemicals like some plastic and aluminum. It's durable and easy to clean. We could have selected a cheaper material, but GRAYL cuts no corners.</p>
<h4>What is activated carbon?</h4>
<p>Activated carbon absorbs waterborne impurities. Carbon has been used for thousands of years - the ancient Phoenicians (1200 BC) stored water in charred barrels for long sea voyages. Carbon is “activated” with heat and oxygen to create tiny pores, which increases the surface area. GRAYL’s G3+ filter incorporates ultra-powdered activated carbon throughout the filter, creating an even higher surface area than in most filters. The carbon is made from natural coconut husks. Activated carbon’s high surface area adsorbs a wide range of impurities commonly found in tap water, including various metals, organic molecules, industrial and pharmaceutical chemicals.</p>
<h4>How fast does the GRAYL Filter water?</h4>
<p>The filter in the Water Filtration Cup filters 16oz in about 15 seconds (2 liters/minute). The purifier filters 16oz in about 30 seconds (1 liter/minute). That’s faster than just about any other hand-held filter on the market.</p>
<h4>Is the filtered water from GRAYL safe for drinking in the Developing World?</h4>
<p>Yes, but use the G3+ Purifier. The G3+ Purifier is your best protection against the full spectrum of waterborne pathogens that cause human disease (bacteria, protozoa and viruses.) Of course, we always recommend filtering the cleanest possible water you can find.</p></span></span><p> </p></span></span></span></span></span><p> </p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Thank you to everyone who contributed to our campaign!

<h1>The Heart Of The Matter...</h1>
<h3>Lets face it – lots of kids find maths boring. But worse still, to some kids, maths is just an insurmountable problem.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Maths tables is the heart of the matter. If the standard method of rote learning isn't working for your child, they're facing a problem that's going to last throughout their schooling – possibly even for the rest of their lives. Because without a firm grasp of tables, you're never going to master maths. And in the case of children with Dyscalculia or Dyslexia, you're looking at an even more intractable problem. </p>
<p>But now there's a simple solution – even for those difficult cases. EazyTables nips the problem in the bud, before it gets a chance to turn your kids off maths forever.</p>
<p>EazyTables is a physical, tangible learning aid – not a computer programme. And EazyTables also gets the balance right for kids. It's not ”bookish” which can put a lot of kids off. But it's not a game either. EazyTables is a fun way to learn that takes the drudgery out of Homework Time.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/113480/files/20131004151908-I_Hate_maths_2.jpg?1380925148"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Let’s change ‘I HATE MATHS’ to ‘MATHS IS FUN!’. Because with the help of EazyTables that’s possible in a very short period of time.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Market Research</h3>
<p>Obviously EazyTables isn't yet available to the public at large – a situation we're hoping to change with the help of the Indiegogo community. But we have trialled EazyTables extensively. And we've<span>  </span>done some market research among parents, teachers, resource teachers and students who've used our system. Feed back has been quite remarkable. Below is a sample of 3 students with very different abilities. See the remarkable effect EazyTables has had on their maths tables performance.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/113930/files/20131005004742-ET_table_graph_showing_student_progress_jpeg.jpg?1380959262"" src="""" style=""width: 571.65px; height: 429px;""/></p>
<h4>Student<span> ‘A’ </span>
</h4>
<p>was finding maths tables a struggle and was getting frustrated with poor results. After 10 weeks Student A was ‘Top of the Class’</p>
<h4>Student<span> </span>‘B’</h4>
<p>has a ‘Specific Learning Difficulty’ and was finding it hard to recall and memorise tables. When introduced to EazyTables you can see it all started to make sense – he started to achieve unbelievable results in such a short time that his parents got quite emotional about the turn around.</p>
<h4>Student<span> </span>‘C’</h4>
<p>this child is Autistic and was having difficulty with Maths. When introduced to EazyTables she found them easy to use and fun. As her test marks improved over the weeks so did her confidence. She was achieving top marks after just a couple of months.</p>
<p><em>Note: just 5 minutes a day is all it took these children to achieve these results.<br/></em></p>
<h3>Testimonials</h3>
<p>My daughter Emma would have had a very negative attitude to maths’s<br/>tables before EasyTables. Now she has a positive attitude to learning tables, making<br/>homework more fun and easier. Her results are just amazing now.                      <em><strong>Niamh Doyle - Parent</strong></em></p>
<p><br/>My Son David, is diagnosed with ‘Receptive Language Disorder’ aged 8. He finds school a big struggle and maths particularly. After using EasyTables<span>  within a matter a weeks he really started to understand Maths Tables, his teacher also commented on the vast improvement. David now tells his friends about </span>EasyTables. I couldn’t recommend them highly enough. Thanks for coming up with them.                         <em><strong>Kay Kerr - Parent</strong></em></p>
<p><br/>My Autistic daughter loved them. As she viewed them as a game she didn’t mind spending just 5 minutes each day with them. I saw her confidence increase greatly in her ability to answer questions.                                                                             <em><strong>Deirdre Costelloe - Parent</strong></em></p>
<p><br/>No doubt about it, there's educational merit in EazyTables. I believe it will prove a great resource for teachers and parents of children. Best of luck with the project. <em><strong>Brian Gilsenan – CEO, CJ Fallon</strong> </em></p>

Maths tables is the heart of the matter. If the standard method of rote learning isn't working for your child, they're facing a problem that's going to last throughout their schooling – possibly even for the rest of their lives. Because without a firm grasp of tables, you're never going to master maths. And in the case of children with Dyscalculia or Dyslexia, you're looking at an even more intractable problem. 
But now there's a simple solution – even for those difficult cases. EazyTables nips the problem in the bud, before it gets a chance to turn your kids off maths forever.
EazyTables is a physical, tangible learning aid – not a computer programme. And EazyTables also gets the balance right for kids. It's not ”bookish” which can put a lot of kids off. But it's not a game either. EazyTables is a fun way to learn that takes the drudgery out of Homework Time.

Let’s change ‘I HATE MATHS’ to ‘MATHS IS FUN!’. Because with the help of EazyTables that’s possible in a very short period of time.
 
Market Research
Obviously EazyTables isn't yet available to the public at large – a situation we're hoping to change with the help of the Indiegogo community. But we have trialled EazyTables extensively. And we've  done some market research among parents, teachers, resource teachers and students who've used our system. Feed back has been quite remarkable. Below is a sample of 3 students with very different abilities. See the remarkable effect EazyTables has had on their maths tables performance.

Student ‘A’ 

was finding maths tables a struggle and was getting frustrated with poor results. After 10 weeks Student A was ‘Top of the Class’
Student ‘B’
has a ‘Specific Learning Difficulty’ and was finding it hard to recall and memorise tables. When introduced to EazyTables you can see it all started to make sense – he started to achieve unbelievable results in such a short time that his parents got quite emotional about the turn around.
Student ‘C’
this child is Autistic and was having difficulty with Maths. When introduced to EazyTables she found them easy to use and fun. As her test marks improved over the weeks so did her confidence. She was achieving top marks after just a couple of months.
Note: just 5 minutes a day is all it took these children to achieve these results.
Testimonials
My daughter Emma would have had a very negative attitude to maths’stables before EasyTables. Now she has a positive attitude to learning tables, makinghomework more fun and easier. Her results are just amazing now.                      Niamh Doyle - Parent
My Son David, is diagnosed with ‘Receptive Language Disorder’ aged 8. He finds school a big struggle and maths particularly. After using EasyTables  within a matter a weeks he really started to understand Maths Tables, his teacher also commented on the vast improvement. David now tells his friends about EasyTables. I couldn’t recommend them highly enough. Thanks for coming up with them.                         Kay Kerr - Parent
My Autistic daughter loved them. As she viewed them as a game she didn’t mind spending just 5 minutes each day with them. I saw her confidence increase greatly in her ability to answer questions.                                                                             Deirdre Costelloe - Parent
No doubt about it, there's educational merit in EazyTables. I believe it will prove a great resource for teachers and parents of children. Best of luck with the project. Brian Gilsenan – CEO, CJ Fallon

Use the power of true 1080p cinematic projection, Android TV system, Harman Kardon sound system, and the cutting edge TV-grade Chipset, created for all your film and music entertainment on the go.  XGIMI’s revolutionary new DLP technology allows the MoGo Pro projector to provide a sharper, crisp image with a physical resolution of 1920x1080 pixels, which means that it projects in true Full HD, 225% clearer than mainstream 720p projectors. MoGo also supports video format up to 4K Ultra HD, which will provide the sharpest image you will ever see from the projector of its size.We believe MoGo should be enjoyed by everyone, whether at home or on the go. Because of this, we created the XGIMI MoGo, which is the wallet-friendly little brother of the MoGo Pro. This means MoGo will feature a 540P native projection resolution at a much more competitive price.Unlike other pico projectors that feature low luminance power and offer a dim and grainy image, XGIMI MoGo Pro offers 250-300 ANSI Lumen power and MoGo offers 210 ANSI Lumen power which can deliver cinematic images with stunning clarity. With XGIMI MoGo and MoGo Pro, you can enjoy your private cinema with an amazing 30’’ - 100’’ Big Screen and great sound. Just put your feet up, sit back and enjoy your perfect movie experience. Who needs to go out when the cinema can be set up in the home or backyard for the kids?  Both MoGo and MoGo Pro are Powered by Harman-Kardon, offering fantastic sound quality with its advanced dual 3 Watt speaker units, which provides extremely cinematic sounds effect.

You can also connect MoGo via Bluetooth or 3.5mm Audio cable and use it as an external Bluetooth speaker. You can Enjoy 300 songs on a single charge!  Both MoGo and MoGo Pro are powered by the Official Android TV 9.0 (upgradable).

Enough for 20,000 movies, meaning you could watch 4 movies with MoGo every day for the next 10 years.  Instead of using direct light for images that might be harmful to your eyes，the XGIMI MoGo uses diffuse reflection light to protect your eyes from tiredness, swell and irritations. Both MoGo and MoGo Pro boast the brand new Amlogic T950X2 TV chip,  Mali G31 GPU, with 2GB RAM and 16GB ROM, which can provide the most advanced image quality and more intelligent and faster automatic focus adjustment.

<p><b>Geçtiğimiz yıl direnişçi dostlarının İndiegogo üzerinden yaptığı bağışlarla stüdyo ekipmanlarını ve kira giderlerinin bir bölümünü karşılayan Çapul TV, önümüzdeki 1 yıl içinde de genişleyen muhabir kadrosuna ekipman sağlamak ve yıllık 40 bin TL'yi bulan kira ve fatura giderlerini karşılamak için dayanışmanızı bekliyor.</b></p>
<p>6 Haziran 2013'te Gezi Parkı'nda kurulan Çapul TV yayın hayatında 1. yılını dolduruyor.</p>
<p>Yıl boyunca direniş neredeyse orada olan Çapul TV, 2. yaşına girdiği ilk hafta da direniş ve medya üzerine özel programlarıyla yine parklarda, sokaklarda olmaya hazırlanıyor.</p>
<p>Çapul TV sokaklardan, parklardan ve direniş alanlarından kesintisiz süren yayınını bu bir yıl içinde biri İstanbul diğeri Ankara'da olmak üzere gönüllülerin katkılarıyla kurulan iki stüdyosu, İzmir Direniş Muhabirleri gibi ""direniş muhabirliği eğitimleri""nde eğittiği yüzlerce gönüllü muhabiri ile zenginleştirdi. Gücünü yalnızca direnişçilerin gönüllü emeği ve katkılarından aldı.</p>
<p>İlkesel olarak reklam ve sponsor kabul etmedi. Çapul TV'yi büyüten bütün emek ve ekipmanlar gönüllü katkılarla sağlandı.</p>
<p>""Alternatif Medya"" üzerine etkinlikler ve eğitim çalışmaları düzenleyebilmek ve katkılar için hesap verilebilir bir kanal oluşturmak için <a href=""http://alternatifmedya.org.tr/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alternatif Medya Derneği</a>'ni kurdu.</p>
<p>""Bu daha başlangıç, mücadeleye devam"" diyenlerin mücadelesi 1 yıldır Çapul TV'yi hiç boşa düşürmedi. Bu mücadele sürdükçe Çapul TV de yola devam edecek.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Çapul TV'nin 1 Yılı</h4>
<ul>
<li>Gezi Parkı'nda (6-15 Haziran) 10 gün boyunca ustream üzerinden yayın yaptığı, yalnızca internet üzerinden 1,5 milyon kişiye ulaştı.</li>
<li>Gezi Parkı'nın boşaltıldığı 15 Haziran akşamı, uzun süre gaz altında yayın yapıp, parkı en son terk eden direnişçiler Çapul TV muhabirleriydi.</li>
<li>8 televizyon kanalı (Halk TV, Hayat TV, İMC, TV 10, Ulusal Kanal, Kanal artı 1, Besta Nuçe) Çapul TV yayınlarını kendi ekranlarına taşıdı.</li>
<li>24 Ekim'de İstanbul'da kurduğu stüdyodan düzenli yayına geçti. Ardından bir stüdyo da Ankara'da kuruldu.</li>
<li>Bu sürede çoğu periyodik 14 özgün program yayımladı.</li>
<li>145 bin <a href=""https://twitter.com/capul_tv"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a>, 20 bin <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/CapulTv"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> takipçisi var.</li>
<li>Haziran İsyanı'nın ardından Eylül direnişinde, Berkin Elvan'ın cenazesinde, Soma eylemlerinde yine yüz binlerce izleyiciye ulaştı.</li>
<li>Berkin Elvan'ın cenaze törenindeki saldırının görüntüleri gibi dava dosyalarına delil olarak giren kayıtları oldu.</li>
<li>Hakkında yerli yabancı sayısız röportaj yayımlandı ve üzerine pek çok akademik tez hazırlanıyor.</li>
<li>Kuruluşuna ön ayak olduğu Alternatif Medya Derneği aracılığıyla 15 ilde 200'e yakın kişiye ""direniş muhabirliği"" eğitimi verdi.</li>
<li>Türkiye'de 20 ilden, ayrıca Kıbrıs'tan canlı yayınlar yaptı. Ayrıca banttan yayınlarla Venezüella ve İtalya'dan bildiriyor.</li>
<li>Çağdaş Gazeteciler Derneği'nin dayanışma ödülüne ve Halkevleri Halkın Hakları Basın Ödülü'ne layık görüldü.</li>

Geçtiğimiz yıl direnişçi dostlarının İndiegogo üzerinden yaptığı bağışlarla stüdyo ekipmanlarını ve kira giderlerinin bir bölümünü karşılayan Çapul TV, önümüzdeki 1 yıl içinde de genişleyen muhabir kadrosuna ekipman sağlamak ve yıllık 40 bin TL'yi bulan kira ve fatura giderlerini karşılamak için dayanışmanızı bekliyor.
6 Haziran 2013'te Gezi Parkı'nda kurulan Çapul TV yayın hayatında 1. yılını dolduruyor.
Yıl boyunca direniş neredeyse orada olan Çapul TV, 2. yaşına girdiği ilk hafta da direniş ve medya üzerine özel programlarıyla yine parklarda, sokaklarda olmaya hazırlanıyor.
Çapul TV sokaklardan, parklardan ve direniş alanlarından kesintisiz süren yayınını bu bir yıl içinde biri İstanbul diğeri Ankara'da olmak üzere gönüllülerin katkılarıyla kurulan iki stüdyosu, İzmir Direniş Muhabirleri gibi ""direniş muhabirliği eğitimleri""nde eğittiği yüzlerce gönüllü muhabiri ile zenginleştirdi. Gücünü yalnızca direnişçilerin gönüllü emeği ve katkılarından aldı.
İlkesel olarak reklam ve sponsor kabul etmedi. Çapul TV'yi büyüten bütün emek ve ekipmanlar gönüllü katkılarla sağlandı.
""Alternatif Medya"" üzerine etkinlikler ve eğitim çalışmaları düzenleyebilmek ve katkılar için hesap verilebilir bir kanal oluşturmak için Alternatif Medya Derneği'ni kurdu.
""Bu daha başlangıç, mücadeleye devam"" diyenlerin mücadelesi 1 yıldır Çapul TV'yi hiç boşa düşürmedi. Bu mücadele sürdükçe Çapul TV de yola devam edecek.
 
Çapul TV'nin 1 Yılı

Gezi Parkı'nda (6-15 Haziran) 10 gün boyunca ustream üzerinden yayın yaptığı, yalnızca internet üzerinden 1,5 milyon kişiye ulaştı.
Gezi Parkı'nın boşaltıldığı 15 Haziran akşamı, uzun süre gaz altında yayın yapıp, parkı en son terk eden direnişçiler Çapul TV muhabirleriydi.
8 televizyon kanalı (Halk TV, Hayat TV, İMC, TV 10, Ulusal Kanal, Kanal artı 1, Besta Nuçe) Çapul TV yayınlarını kendi ekranlarına taşıdı.
24 Ekim'de İstanbul'da kurduğu stüdyodan düzenli yayına geçti. Ardından bir stüdyo da Ankara'da kuruldu.
Bu sürede çoğu periyodik 14 özgün program yayımladı.
145 bin Twitter, 20 bin Facebook takipçisi var.
Haziran İsyanı'nın ardından Eylül direnişinde, Berkin Elvan'ın cenazesinde, Soma eylemlerinde yine yüz binlerce izleyiciye ulaştı.
Berkin Elvan'ın cenaze törenindeki saldırının görüntüleri gibi dava dosyalarına delil olarak giren kayıtları oldu.
Hakkında yerli yabancı sayısız röportaj yayımlandı ve üzerine pek çok akademik tez hazırlanıyor.
Kuruluşuna ön ayak olduğu Alternatif Medya Derneği aracılığıyla 15 ilde 200'e yakın kişiye ""direniş muhabirliği"" eğitimi verdi.
Türkiye'de 20 ilden, ayrıca Kıbrıs'tan canlı yayınlar yaptı. Ayrıca banttan yayınlarla Venezüella ve İtalya'dan bildiriyor.
Çağdaş Gazeteciler Derneği'nin dayanışma ödülüne ve Halkevleri Halkın Hakları Basın Ödülü'ne layık görüldü.

9. Uluslararası İşçi Filmleri Festivali'nin düzenleyicilerinden biri oldu.
Çapul TV i-pad'i, yolsuzluk görüşmelerinin TV'den verilmediği 5 Mayıs günü Melda Onur'un ustream yayınında kullanılmak üzere TBMM'ye girmeyi de başardı.

<p>At Goji, we have developed a technologically advanced, beautifully designed smart lock that gives you complete control over access to your home using your mobile phone. Our Goji Smart Lock is distinguished by its sleek, sophisticated design and its unique ability to send you real-time picture alerts via text or email of the individuals accessing your home.</p>
<h1>The Goji Smart Lock</h1>
<p>The Goji Smart Lock presents a contemporary new look for a deadbolt lock: a sleek, modern disc in brushed metal with a subtle blue-text LED display that welcomes users by name when the lock is activated. The display also shows the lock/unlock status, and dates and times of all entries and exits. Its elegant simplicity fits with any home décor. </p>
<p>The Goji Smart Lock is UL listed.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/848152/pictures/original/20130603114032-Side_image.jpg?1370284834"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h1>Goji sends picture alerts</h1>
<p>The Goji Smart Lock has a built-in camera that takes a picture of anyone activating the lock and sends a real-time picture alert to your mobile phone, providing you with visual confirmation of who is accessing your home. You can also choose to receive real-time app and text notifications on your mobile phone about all the activity around your Goji Smart Lock. All activity is recorded and logged by the system and is available to review at any time via the Goji Mobile App or from your online Goji account.  </p>
<p><img alt=""Picture alerts"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/842970/pictures/full/20130531111837-picture_alerts.jpg?1370024323"" src="""" style="""" title=""Picture alerts""/></p>
<h1>Send Goji Electronic Keys to anyone, even for a specific date and time</h1>
<p>With Goji, you can send electronic keys to anyone via text or email, and you can set up the access to be unlimited or to include specific date/day and time parameters. No more worrying about getting back your keys from guests or renters. With Goji, you can securely send electronic keys to houseguests or home service professionals (housekeepers, dog walkers, contractors, etc.) so they can access your home using their mobile phones. You can cancel or change the electronic key parameters at any time. This is also a great feature for people who rent their homes to short-term guests through sites such as Airbnb.</p>

<h1>The Goji Smart Lock works with key fobs and traditional key backups</h1>
<p>The Goji Smart Lock is optimized to be used with your smart phone, but you can also program Bluetooth Low Energy fobs that you can use to lock and unlock your door, similar to the way a car's remote works, but with additional personalized time and date access rights. Fobs are great for children or other people who don't carry smart phones yet, or if you want to go for a run and don't want to take your smart phone with you. The Goji Smart Lock also comes with two mechanical keys as backups in case you ever need them.</p>
<p> <img alt=""Key fob and mechanical key"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/848901/pictures/full/20130603181606-keys.jpg?1370308570"" src="""" style="""" title=""Key fob and mechanical key""/></p>
<h1>Goji is on call 24x7</h1>
<p>With Goji, you will never be locked out of your home. We have customer service representatives available 24/7 to help you lock or unlock your home remotely in case something happens to your phone. Goji can also send a certified locksmith to your home to help you with any installation or repair need. We are with you every step of the way with a certified network of locksmiths always on call.</p>
<p> <img alt=""call center"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/848900/pictures/full/20130603181555-call_center.jpg?1370308561"" src="""" style="""" title=""call center""/></p>
<h1>Lock your door from anywhere in the world</h1>
<p>Goji´s powerful Mobile App enables you to lock and unlock your door from anywhere in the world. This is a great feature to check to see if you forgot to lock your door and you’re already too far away to run back and check it!</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/558/844/17354d04a65e90ba75948c6bfa76f9fc_large.jpg?1367440725"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h1>Never again dig in your purse or your pocket for keys</h1>
<p>Goji´s Mobile App also enables you to lock and unlock your door automatically using your mobile phone without having to take your phone out of your purse or pocket to activate it. The Goji Smart Lock knows if you are inside your home or if you are coming from the street. If you are coming from the street, Goji will open the door automatically, and if you are inside of your house, Goji will not unlock your door as you approach it before you know who is at the other side.</p>

<h1>Works with all Mobile Phones</h1>
<p>The Goji Smart Lock connects with your smart phone using Bluetooth Low Energy. The connections are coded with bank-level encryption to enssure your electronic safety.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/558/851/2f270fb9afa635e843ddca78c1ea0dbc_large.jpg?1367440863"" src="""" style=""""/></div>

<p>We are confident that the sustainable design and manufacturing methods used to create Goji Smart Lock not only will produce a great product, but will give users a true sense of confidence and control over the access to their home. Bringing all the pieces come together has its challenges, but we have done our homework and are ready to bring Goji Smart Lock to market. We will use these funds to start production and finalize the software and electronics of the Goji Smart Lock.</p>
</div></div>","At Goji, we have developed a technologically advanced, beautifully designed smart lock that gives you complete control over access to your home using your mobile phone. Our Goji Smart Lock is distinguished by its sleek, sophisticated design and its unique ability to send you real-time picture alerts via text or email of the individuals accessing your home.
The Goji Smart Lock
The Goji Smart Lock presents a contemporary new look for a deadbolt lock: a sleek, modern disc in brushed metal with a subtle blue-text LED display that welcomes users by name when the lock is activated. The display also shows the lock/unlock status, and dates and times of all entries and exits. Its elegant simplicity fits with any home décor. 
The Goji Smart Lock is UL listed.



Goji sends picture alerts
The Goji Smart Lock has a built-in camera that takes a picture of anyone activating the lock and sends a real-time picture alert to your mobile phone, providing you with visual confirmation of who is accessing your home. You can also choose to receive real-time app and text notifications on your mobile phone about all the activity around your Goji Smart Lock. All activity is recorded and logged by the system and is available to review at any time via the Goji Mobile App or from your online Goji account.  

Send Goji Electronic Keys to anyone, even for a specific date and time
With Goji, you can send electronic keys to anyone via text or email, and you can set up the access to be unlimited or to include specific date/day and time parameters. No more worrying about getting back your keys from guests or renters. With Goji, you can securely send electronic keys to houseguests or home service professionals (housekeepers, dog walkers, contractors, etc.) so they can access your home using their mobile phones. You can cancel or change the electronic key parameters at any time. This is also a great feature for people who rent their homes to short-term guests through sites such as Airbnb.
 
The Goji Smart Lock works with key fobs and traditional key backups
The Goji Smart Lock is optimized to be used with your smart phone, but you can also program Bluetooth Low Energy fobs that you can use to lock and unlock your door, similar to the way a car's remote works, but with additional personalized time and date access rights. Fobs are great for children or other people who don't carry smart phones yet, or if you want to go for a run and don't want to take your smart phone with you. The Goji Smart Lock also comes with two mechanical keys as backups in case you ever need them.
 
Goji is on call 24x7
With Goji, you will never be locked out of your home. We have customer service representatives available 24/7 to help you lock or unlock your home remotely in case something happens to your phone. Goji can also send a certified locksmith to your home to help you with any installation or repair need. We are with you every step of the way with a certified network of locksmiths always on call.
 
Lock your door from anywhere in the world
Goji´s powerful Mobile App enables you to lock and unlock your door from anywhere in the world. This is a great feature to check to see if you forgot to lock your door and you’re already too far away to run back and check it!

Never again dig in your purse or your pocket for keys
Goji´s Mobile App also enables you to lock and unlock your door automatically using your mobile phone without having to take your phone out of your purse or pocket to activate it. The Goji Smart Lock knows if you are inside your home or if you are coming from the street. If you are coming from the street, Goji will open the door automatically, and if you are inside of your house, Goji will not unlock your door as you approach it before you know who is at the other side.

Works with all Mobile Phones
The Goji Smart Lock connects with your smart phone using Bluetooth Low Energy. The connections are coded with bank-level encryption to enssure your electronic safety.

Simple to install, do it yourself
The Goji Smart Lock is designed to be totally do-it-yourself. It is easy to mount on the door, and includes a simple WiFi set up. The system walks you through every step. The lock is battery operated and will send you app alerts and text messages when the batteries start to get low.  The lock uses AA batteries that will last for one year. 

International installation and shipping

What started as a hobby has now progressed to an obsession; I make beautiful and useful objects from reclaimed and salvaged materials. Up until now, space and equipment has confined me to making smaller objects like trays, serving boards, and tea hutches, but sales have taken off, and it's time to tackle my long-held dream of creating rustic furniture!</p><p>The older I get, the more I am upset by the throw-it-away mentality of a convenience store culture. In these times of change, it's more important than ever to give back to nature by working with what has already been felled. I create with love and respect. There is so much plenty in the world, so much amazing and beautiful material that just needs a little love to help its beauty shine. Every tiny step we take away from waste and towards beauty and utility is worth any effort it takes, and the reward is both in the doing and in the product. In my small way I hope to show people how a solid and beautiful piece of wood can help create calm from with in.</p><p>My work is supported both by my creative drive and by the many folks who appreciate the high quality products I make. As a contributor, you will be a partner in this creation, and I hope that you will love the beautiful objects we create together.</p><p>While this is my first crowdfunding campaign, I have a long history of careful husbanding of my resources. Your contribution will be treated with the greatest gratitude and respect, and used to directly fund the goals below.</p><p><strong>WHAT WE NEED</strong></p><p>I'm looking to raise $4000. Here's where it's going:</p><p>First and most importantly, I need a larger space. The rent on the shop I've found is $600 per month, but it's a perfect space (it's already a woodshop), and it has great road frontage and visibility for local sales. I want to have at least three month's rent in hand ($1800) to tide me over during the transition.</p><p>Second, I desperately need an industrial bandsaw. This will run $900, and will thankfully replace my hard-working but weak ""hobby"" model.</p><p>Third, the wood I use is often large, rough, warped, or all three, so a 15"" planer is not simply a luxury but a necessity. That's another $900.</p><p>Finally, the kiln. Reclaimed wood often is infested with wood borers and other wood-eating bugs, and a kiln will allow me to salvage more wood by killing the bugs. The price for this may vary; I have a good friend who is, yes, a rocket scientist, and may be able to help me design and build a kiln for the cost of materials, but at minimum it will be $300-400.</p><p>The remainder will allow me to send you your perks!</p><p><strong>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</strong></p><p>Artistic endeavors always include risk—mostly the risk of not finding a large-enough audience to make it profitable. In my case, the rent is the most difficult variable, since the business will have to bring in enough income to support the monthly expense. Since my sales have been going up, and because there is a growing movement in the US towards appreciation of handmade goods, I am confident that I can keep sales high enough to do this, especially since one key element of selling is having LOTS of things to sell! It is a truism in retail that in order to sell three things you have to have ten on display, and the new shop space will allow me to do this far more easily than in my current situation.</p><p>In addition to dabbling in wood for twenty years, I've spent my professional life in retail, (usually in management positions), so I'm well-versed in the marketing of handmade objects. I've already started expanding my online presence, separating Shire Home Furnishings' Etsy store from my parent company, Tuatha (Irish- and Norse-inspired brooches, art and jewelry). This allows me to reach a more targeted audience, further increasing sales. In addition, I will be adding more craft festivals to my roster (currently at 6 festivals a year). Vending as Shire Home will allow me to enter the higher-end, juried shows which are currently closed to Tuatha. In addition, I will continue to post regularly on social media, increasing the visibility and reach of my products. I may also expand the Shire line into rustic-themed wedding accoutrements.</p><p>If I don't reach my goal, the new shop is the number one priority. The rent is cheap for the amount of space, and once I have more room I can stockpile more wood and save money for the tools I need.</p><p><strong>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</strong></p><p>Hey, I know what it's like to not have ready money to support a campaign like this, but don't worry, I'm grateful for any help you can give me!</p><p>Share this campaign on social media, via email or even—gasp!—by word of mouth!

<p>Most of the bottled water you buy is just glorified tap water. Only a few brands use water directly from springs and mountain streams. 90% of the cost of bottled water is based on marketing and packaging, not the water quality. On top of that, it takes 3 liters of tap water to produce 1 liter of bottled water!</p>
<p>It’s about time that we take back the tap and put an end to this global insanity. One filter can help you save 90% of your current water cost or more than USD 1,000 per year.</p>

One filter cartridge lasts up to 130 gallons (500 L) and can easily be replaced. Forget about buying expensive and heavy water bottles from your supermarket. DrinkPure HOME can help your family save more than USD 1,000 per year and will reduce your plastic bottle waste by more than 99%.Know someone who would love the DrinkPure HOME water filter? Help us spread the word by sharing on your social media accounts!  We are featured in: DrinkPure HOME is the only faucet water filter in the world that combines all the following features. See for yourself what DrinkPure HOME can do for your tap water! 

 
It fits on your existing faucet and can be installed within seconds – yes, it is that simple. One filter cartridge lasts up to 130 gallons (500 L) or two months and can easily be replaced.
The water that flows through our filter will always be safe from bacteria and viruses, even after more than 130 gallons. The flow rate will just decrease and the emerging chlorine smell will tell you that it’s time to replace the filter cartridge.  If you would like to get a reminder, just scan the QR code on each replacement cartridge! This sends you a calendar entry reminding you of a possible exchange after two months. It also tells you where to order new cartridges. You do not need to install an app!  More than 100 million plastic bottles are used worldwide every day. Only 1 out of 5 plastic bottles is recycled.Using DrinkPure HOME reduces plastic waste by more than 99%. The replaceable cartridge weighs as much as one empty 1 liter plastic bottle and replaces up to 500 x 1 liter or 1000 x 0.5 liter bottles.This is our cartridge size compared to other available cartridges on the market: 

 
Most of the bottled water you buy is just glorified tap water. Only a few brands use water directly from springs and mountain streams. 90% of the cost of bottled water is based on marketing and packaging, not the water quality. On top of that, it takes 3 liters of tap water to produce 1 liter of bottled water!
It’s about time that we take back the tap and put an end to this global insanity. One filter can help you save 90% of your current water cost or more than USD 1,000 per year.

<p>Naushad Ali is the owner and inventor of Drain Strain, LLC. Naushad has worked as a realtor for since the mid-2000's and was strongly impacted by the recession - he and his family lost everything, including their home. While living at an apartment with the family in 2011, Naushad's wife, Shawn, and his daughter’s hair clogged their sink and he had to call a plumber to help. After a $151 bill, he looked for a solution to prevent clogs in the future online and in stores, but had no such luck. His thought was, ""Why isn't there something that's easy to install, affordable, and prevents clogs?""  He brainstormed an idea with family and friends, and the Sink Drain Strain® idea was born! </p>
<p>After working on the design for a couple years, Naushad was able to get the product to a prototype stage when he had the opportunity to appear on ABC’s Shark Tank in February 2015 with and received a deal from Robert Herjavec. With the help and support of partners, Naushad has been able to get the Sink Drain Strain into Home Depot and recently appeared on QVC as well. </p>
<p>Since the recession, Naushad has been able to turn around his real-estate business enough to become  a a principal owner of Northwest Dream Team, LLC ( <a href=""http://www.nwdreamteam.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.nwdreamteam.com</a>) , one of the top producing real estate teams in Washington. Naushad's unrelenting focus on consumer experience lands him consistently in Seattle Magazine’s list of 5 Star Agents and in the Top 1% of Realtors Nationally.</p>

Meet The Owner & Inventor, Naushad Ali

Naushad Ali is the owner and inventor of Drain Strain, LLC. Naushad has worked as a realtor for since the mid-2000's and was strongly impacted by the recession - he and his family lost everything, including their home. While living at an apartment with the family in 2011, Naushad's wife, Shawn, and his daughter’s hair clogged their sink and he had to call a plumber to help. After a $151 bill, he looked for a solution to prevent clogs in the future online and in stores, but had no such luck. His thought was, ""Why isn't there something that's easy to install, affordable, and prevents clogs?""  He brainstormed an idea with family and friends, and the Sink Drain Strain® idea was born! 
After working on the design for a couple years, Naushad was able to get the product to a prototype stage when he had the opportunity to appear on ABC’s Shark Tank in February 2015 with and received a deal from Robert Herjavec. With the help and support of partners, Naushad has been able to get the Sink Drain Strain into Home Depot and recently appeared on QVC as well. 
Since the recession, Naushad has been able to turn around his real-estate business enough to become  a a principal owner of Northwest Dream Team, LLC ( www.nwdreamteam.com) , one of the top producing real estate teams in Washington. Naushad's unrelenting focus on consumer experience lands him consistently in Seattle Magazine’s list of 5 Star Agents and in the Top 1% of Realtors Nationally.

The battery can support the vacuum to operate for up to 60 minutes. Enough for cleaning a whole house of around 380 square meters at once.
 

 

The vacuum cleaner is not only used for floor cleaning. We can also apply it to clean your sofa, bed, vent, keyboard, shelf, cupboard and lots of other things.

Chung is the expert of the expert now that he has been in the robot cleaner industry for 12 years. Chung started off as a development manager at a robot company but since the company was experiencing a financial downfall, he had to stand alone. Everybot consists mostly of the employees from the experts at the previous company, and Chung is actively growing the company. We heard more from Woochul Chung, CEO, who made people around the world fall in love with the unique peanut shaped machine with outstanding technology and reasonable price, about his inspiration for starting the business, his business philosophy, and more.</p><p>The birth of “Everybot” from the conceptual shift.</p><p>“I have been developing the robot, and the consumers were very interested in the first generation everyday use robot. However, the reality of the robot cleaners was that they could not properly clean because there were obstacles in the way and the consumers were dissatisfied about the high price. After asking a 3<sup>rd</sup> party to research what the consumers want, we found out that the answers were “cheap price” and “mop cleaning”. The normal vacuum cleaners are not hard to use, but just gets lazy to do it. However, mopping requires strength so the consumers constantly found it needy. So I thought of making a robot cleaner that could mop.”</p><p>Of the former robot cleaners, there have been ones that also had the mopping feature. Because they only rely on their weight, they lacked strength like a child would mop. While Chung pondered about how to make it cheaper and still effectively clean, he thought of the car’s alignment, which measures the suspension and caster angles in the front of the car. Chung said, “the car wheels look like they are straight from the naked eye but they have intricate angles within that we cannot see. In order to make the circular mop rotating panel to rotate in a stationary position, it becomes harder to move around but changing angles to this allows for it to move forward. Our product cleans while rotating but also is made to move and work only with the rotating panel and the mop so that we could reduce the unit cost. Therefore, we produced a product, “Everybot,” that meets the practical needs.”</p><p>Attract the consumers with a unique identity.</p><p>Chung believes that the most important aspect in dominating over the market are unique product and idea, and he said, “the funny thing is that there are globally large-scale companies in the home electronics market but the middle and small sized companies tend to outstand them. This is because they begin with a unique idea and they are able to dominate the market. Also, I think that the design is as important as the technique in making a product. A lot of the products that the middle and small sized companies produce lack in the design aspect. We focus a lot on making the product design, catalog, and web skills all match in style and unique.” He also emphasized that he wants to grow the company and at the same time make everyone around the world think of “Everybot” for the personal service robot by using the B2B (Business to Business) method along with foreign companies to make more profit and provide techniques.</p><p>3 conditions to success: challenge, overcome, accomplishment</p><p>When Chung was young, he thought “how do people succeed?” and tried to look for the methods to success. The answer was pretty simple. It was “challenge.” He said that he needs to challenge himself because if he doesn’t do anything, nothing happens. Also, he believes that a strong will to “overcome” the obstacles is necessary after challenging himself and when various techniques harmoniously come together, he is able to “accomplish” something. So he highlighted those three words, challenge, overcome, and accomplishment. “We can’t live all our lives by just working and we need to enjoy our lives. We need to work hard and be competent in the social role outside and at home, we need to be great in taking part as the head of the family and a parent, spending good times with the kids.”</p><p>I wish the best for Everybot to be the world’s “Everybot” through Woochul Chung’s, CEO, endless challenges and passion for the better quality of life.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480519821/xmbcynutrg6tekccmbya.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>Support This Project and Help Make the Lives of Millions of Housewives Easier!</strong></p><p>After thorough designing and meticulous patenting, EVERYBOT RS500 is ready to hit the market.</p><p>To make this possible, though, we kindly request your precious support.

Chung is the expert of the expert now that he has been in the robot cleaner industry for 12 years. Chung started off as a development manager at a robot company but since the company was experiencing a financial downfall, he had to stand alone. Everybot consists mostly of the employees from the experts at the previous company, and Chung is actively growing the company. We heard more from Woochul Chung, CEO, who made people around the world fall in love with the unique peanut shaped machine with outstanding technology and reasonable price, about his inspiration for starting the business, his business philosophy, and more.The birth of “Everybot” from the conceptual shift.“I have been developing the robot, and the consumers were very interested in the first generation everyday use robot. However, the reality of the robot cleaners was that they could not properly clean because there were obstacles in the way and the consumers were dissatisfied about the high price. After asking a 3rd party to research what the consumers want, we found out that the answers were “cheap price” and “mop cleaning”. The normal vacuum cleaners are not hard to use, but just gets lazy to do it. However, mopping requires strength so the consumers constantly found it needy. So I thought of making a robot cleaner that could mop.”Of the former robot cleaners, there have been ones that also had the mopping feature. Because they only rely on their weight, they lacked strength like a child would mop. While Chung pondered about how to make it cheaper and still effectively clean, he thought of the car’s alignment, which measures the suspension and caster angles in the front of the car. Chung said, “the car wheels look like they are straight from the naked eye but they have intricate angles within that we cannot see. In order to make the circular mop rotating panel to rotate in a stationary position, it becomes harder to move around but changing angles to this allows for it to move forward. Our product cleans while rotating but also is made to move and work only with the rotating panel and the mop so that we could reduce the unit cost. Therefore, we produced a product, “Everybot,” that meets the practical needs.”Attract the consumers with a unique identity.Chung believes that the most important aspect in dominating over the market are unique product and idea, and he said, “the funny thing is that there are globally large-scale companies in the home electronics market but the middle and small sized companies tend to outstand them. This is because they begin with a unique idea and they are able to dominate the market. Also, I think that the design is as important as the technique in making a product. A lot of the products that the middle and small sized companies produce lack in the design aspect. We focus a lot on making the product design, catalog, and web skills all match in style and unique.” He also emphasized that he wants to grow the company and at the same time make everyone around the world think of “Everybot” for the personal service robot by using the B2B (Business to Business) method along with foreign companies to make more profit and provide techniques.3 conditions to success: challenge, overcome, accomplishmentWhen Chung was young, he thought “how do people succeed?” and tried to look for the methods to success. The answer was pretty simple. It was “challenge.” He said that he needs to challenge himself because if he doesn’t do anything, nothing happens. Also, he believes that a strong will to “overcome” the obstacles is necessary after challenging himself and when various techniques harmoniously come together, he is able to “accomplish” something. So he highlighted those three words, challenge, overcome, and accomplishment. “We can’t live all our lives by just working and we need to enjoy our lives. We need to work hard and be competent in the social role outside and at home, we need to be great in taking part as the head of the family and a parent, spending good times with the kids.”I wish the best for Everybot to be the world’s “Everybot” through Woochul Chung’s, CEO, endless challenges and passion for the better quality of life.   Support This Project and Help Make the Lives of Millions of Housewives Easier!After thorough designing and meticulous patenting, EVERYBOT RS500 is ready to hit the market.To make this possible, though, we kindly request your precious support.

<p>This may not be suitable for you if you want to power your entire house and big appliances like air conditioners, laundry machines, lawnmowers, electric baseboard or electric portable heaters, electric hot water heaters, electric kettles or cooking stove-tops.

<p><b>HOW DO I POWER MY HOUSE FURNACE?</b></p>
<p>In order to power up your most important item, your main house furnace to stay warm, beforehand you will need to install a simple bypass electrical plug near your furnace switch.  You can either do this yourself, or your licensed furnace HVAC service technician can easily do it, or you can hire an electrician if you wish.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>HOW MUCH POWER CAN THIS PROVIDE?</b></p>
<p>The amount of power provided varies by vehicle.  The first and most important goal is to power your gas furnace to keep your house warm.  Our testing shows that a typical furnace needs between 100-400 watts of solid power to run.  After that everything else is a bonus up to the maximum your vehicle can provide.  Once your furnace is running and you see how much power it uses, you can then add cellphone chargers, laptops, ipads, tablets, computers, a few lights, fridges and freezers depending on what your car provides.   You can also rotate devices in shifts, so plug in fridges/freezers for a few hours then switch to power other devices for a few hours to maximize your available power. </p>

<p><b>THE CAR HOUSE HEATER STORY</b></p>
<p>Our founder Jonathan has always had a passion for anything technical.  If he goes over to someone’s house and they are having problems with their stereo or computer or just about anything technical, it’s irresistible to him to fix or resolve it.  Jonathan has run a software tech company for the last 20+ years and has learned a thing or two about technology and how to apply it to solve real world problems.</p>
<p>A few years ago Jonathan built a system so his family could go camping “off grid” and have all the power they wanted.  Around the time that hurricane Sandy was approaching, he realized that the same concept could be adapted to power the essentials in their house, and delightfully it did!  The best example happened in December 2013 when Toronto had a complete power outage from an ice storm 3 days before Christmas.  Jonathan hooked up the system to his house furnace and they were completely comfortable for 3+ days with our house temperature 23c/75f degrees and the furnace running like normal, even when all of their neighbors had abandoned their houses, until power was restored on Christmas eve day.  Check out the news story published here: <a href=""http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2013/12/24/stories_of_the_toronto_ice_storm.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2013/12/24/stories_of_the_toronto_ice_storm.html</a></p>
<p><b>OUR RAISON D'ETRE AND WHY WE STARTED THIS</b></p>
<p>The clincher or raison d’etre that solidified the real world need for this, happened just after the ice storm while Jonathan was speaking with other parents at his daughter’s school and they told him how their house got so cold they were forced to abandon their house, the pipes froze, and massive water damage occurred throughout the house causing extensive repairs of ceiling, drywall and floors, a costly insurance claim, and significant upset for their family.   This could have so easily been avoided, eliminating hassle upset and a big insurance claim.</p>
<p>Just like when Jonathan started his first software tech company 20+ years ago , friends and family were amazed at how he did this and then encouraged him to package the idea up into something that could benefit everyone, and so CarHouseHeater  was born!</p> <p> </p>

A few years ago Jonathan built a system so his family could go camping “off grid” and have all the power they wanted.  Around the time that hurricane Sandy was approaching, he realized that the same concept could be adapted to power the essentials in their house, and delightfully it did!  The best example happened in December 2013 when Toronto had a complete power outage from an ice storm 3 days before Christmas.  Jonathan hooked up the system to his house furnace and they were completely comfortable for 3+ days with our house temperature 23c/75f degrees and the furnace running like normal, even when all of their neighbors had abandoned their houses, until power was restored on Christmas eve day.  Check out the news story published here: http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2013/12/24/stories_of_the_toronto_ice_storm.html
OUR RAISON D'ETRE AND WHY WE STARTED THIS
The clincher or raison d’etre that solidified the real world need for this, happened just after the ice storm while Jonathan was speaking with other parents at his daughter’s school and they told him how their house got so cold they were forced to abandon their house, the pipes froze, and massive water damage occurred throughout the house causing extensive repairs of ceiling, drywall and floors, a costly insurance claim, and significant upset for their family.   This could have so easily been avoided, eliminating hassle upset and a big insurance claim.
Just like when Jonathan started his first software tech company 20+ years ago , friends and family were amazed at how he did this and then encouraged him to package the idea up into something that could benefit everyone, and so CarHouseHeater  was born!",5.0,4,"1 Campaign

<h3>RAGAMUF story</h3>

<p>The founder, Martta Leskelä, wanted to start a business with a humane cause so she thought of employing refugee women without a livelihood. The Leskelä family lived in Turkey in 2015-2016 so it was natural for her to start working with the Syrian refugee women residing in Turkey. The main idea behind RAGAMUF was to employ Syrian refugee women so that they can live more independent and happy life. </p>
<p>At the same time, the designer, Tuula Pöyhönen, had an idea for a stretchy chair rug while living in an artists' residence in Scotland in the summer of 2015. There was an ugly old sofa, which she wanted to adorn. She used her previous experience with rags and athletic clothing material to create a chair rug and made a prototype in Marocco in the beginning of 2016. </p>
<p>In March 2016,  Martta and Tuula shared their ideas and combined their knowledge and passion. RAGAMUF was born as a result of this effort.</p>

In fact, the real shipping prices are higher than what we've listed, as we are trying to subsidize some of the cost. That being said, we're doing our very best to negotiate lower prices with these carriers so that we can make RAGAMUF chair rugs affordable to everyone, regardless of where they may live. Will I have to pay customs duties to receive my reward?This depends on your country's tax code. Any applicable customs duties outside of EU are the sole responsibility of the backer and not our team. We have absolutely no control over charging each backer additional customs duties at the time the pledge is made so such fees (if applicable) may be imposed at the time of receiving the package. If you are unsure whether or not you will be charged customs duties at the time of receiving your reward, please get in touch with your local post office.Are RAGAMUFs displayed somewhere?Right now RAGAMUF chair rug covers are displayed only in Helsinki and Oulu, in Finland. Contact us by email to receive more detailed information of the locations.What is your refund policy?We cannot offer refunds to backers once the project has ended with an exception of an unlikely instance of a defective reward being shipped out due to the nature of the Indiegogo campaign. As soon as the campaign ends, the production phase begins. Therefore, we cannot offer refunds once the campaign has ended.Please refer to Indiegogo's policy here.",36.0,2,"1 Campaign

<h3>First, I want to thank everyone for taking the time to look at my video, and for checking out what Im about below.</h3>
<h3>Who am I and what am I doing and why?</h3>
<p>My name is Brian Garvey, Im from the West of Ireland</p>
<h3>What is the Carbon Comet Desk Light?</h3>
<p>The Carbon Comet Desk light is a light that has never been seen before. First off, its unique as you can see and has a catchy name too I think you'll agree. I went to a lot of trouble picking a grade of alloy that anodizes to give a particular shade of grey that is not common to normal anodized aluminium, the finished colour is closer to titanium, which is what I was after. Normal anodized aluminium can look very cheap - I wanted to avoid that at all costs.</p>
<p>The bulbs themselves are also a first in terms of Desk lights. They are high output led technology in festoon format. Being 12volt, they are very safe, and they also consume very little energy. They last many thousands of hours longer than older filament type bulbs and are far superior in general. </p>
<p>A lot of thought also went into the head of the light. The bulbs can be rotated  as you can see from the video. This allows the user to setup the focal point on what he/she is working on with mininal fuss. As you can also see from the video, the user can look through the shade portion directly at the work should he or she have to take a closer look at something. This idea came to me having spent many frustrating hours trying to light something I was working on, and either the shade getting in the way, or the workpiece ending up poorly lit. </p>
<p>Of course, if you're not the hands on type this light is also for you. Its very slick looks and fantastic design make it fit into a modern or traditional style setting. Perhaps also, you or someone you know is into fine automotive, from rally, to race, exotics, or F1, they will understand and cherish what this light is all about without question.</p>
<p>There is no doubt, that it has been designed and built from the best materials, with no compromise. </p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I want to make a first batch of ten of these lights. I want to put at least that many into the hands of people in order for them to see the quality, and believe in both the product, and my ability, I certainly do.</p>
<p>I have one Carbon Comet built as you can see in the video, it is fully finished bar rubber feet, it has been tested for hours, and is also anodized. </p>
<p>For that one light, I have all the machine code written to drive the cnc mill used to machine all the parts. </p>
<p>I do need the funding in order to buy more aluminium, carbon fibre cloth, bulbs, fittings, switches, wire, and name plates. I also have to buy aluminium tool plate and some more cnc cutters in order to make proper jigs so that I can machine batches of parts easily. If full funding is not reached, and you have ordered a light, or anything else in the line of perks, you will recieve them. Im in this for the long haul whatever it takes.</p>
<p><span>PLEASE, DO NOT FORGET TO ADD THE SHIPPING COST TO YOUR CONTRIBUTION. </span></p>
<p><span>Be it for the photo, T-shirt,  package bundle, or Carbon Comet.</span></p>
<p><span>Ireland, 5 dollars, Uk, 7 dollars, USA, 10 dollars, China, 12 dollars. &gt; Perks. </span></p>
<p><span>Ireland, 7.50 dollars, Uk, 10 dollars, USA, 17 dollars, China, 22 dollars. &gt; Carbon Comet Desk Light, track and track postage.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By supporting this project in whatever way you can you will be part of something big to come. This is just the tip of the iceberg. I have more ideas I cannot wait to prototype out and get working on but I can only do one at a time. My previous project, My motorsport picture frames were a big hit. You can look at those on my personal website. The Carbon Comet will be on there shortly too as soon as my website bulder is back at work on Monday.</p>
<p>Im sick of poor quality products doing the rounds of late. Lets bring something into the world, granted, and little more expensive, but built to last, and be cherished and admired by all. </p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help if you cant fund</h3>
<p>Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:</p>
<p>So what else can you do?</p>
<p>Easy! Spread the word about this cool little light, its simple, just tweet about it, share on facebook, or even email it onto your friends. Everyone has someone that will just love this. </p>
<p>Show it around at work, at school, in college(dont get in trouble!) at home, or even go out on the street and shout about it!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thats it for the time being folks, I want to thank you all one more time for your support,</p>

Ireland, 7.50 dollars, Uk, 10 dollars, USA, 17 dollars, China, 22 dollars. > Carbon Comet Desk Light, track and track postage.



The Impact
By supporting this project in whatever way you can you will be part of something big to come. This is just the tip of the iceberg. I have more ideas I cannot wait to prototype out and get working on but I can only do one at a time. My previous project, My motorsport picture frames were a big hit. You can look at those on my personal website. The Carbon Comet will be on there shortly too as soon as my website bulder is back at work on Monday.
Im sick of poor quality products doing the rounds of late. Lets bring something into the world, granted, and little more expensive, but built to last, and be cherished and admired by all. 



Other Ways You Can Help if you cant fund
Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:
So what else can you do?
Easy! Spread the word about this cool little light, its simple, just tweet about it, share on facebook, or even email it onto your friends. Everyone has someone that will just love this. 
Show it around at work, at school, in college(dont get in trouble!) at home, or even go out on the street and shout about it!
 
Thats it for the time being folks, I want to thank you all one more time for your support,
 
Regards, 
 
Brian Garvey.

 Unboxing Review About XCLEA H30 Plus

 
  Other robot vacuums on the market are either stupid navigation or can only empty the grimy dust bin manually, and many of them do not even come with both vacuum and mop function. They may not have much practical application and finally becomes a decoration only.Here we introduce the XCLEA H30 Plus robot vacuum and mop 2 in 1 cleaner for you, with its own self-emptying dust collection base that can completely free your hands. The dust box of most robot vacuum cleaners can only pick up dust under the suction mode, and most robot vacuum & mop cleaners do not pick up dust when the water tank is attached and the mopping mode is on. None of them can be fully automated. The XCLEA intelligent self-emptying dust collection base structurally optimizes the robot vacuum and the dust collector to achieve genuine full automation. You no longer have to remove the water tank manually before switching to the dust collection mode. It's all about convenience, save you lots of time and effort. The 23 Kpa suction power is equivalent to a 3 meters of water column. Under such strong pressure, the self-emptying base will suck to remove all the hair and large particles from the dust bin of the robot. At the same time, XCLEA optimizes the transmission structure and adopts the transmission method of direct suction to reduce the whirling of dust and dirt in the channel without causing blockages. Avoiding the trouble of dredging and maintenance. XCLEA is added convenience and peace of mind to your life. A 3L oversized dust bag is provided in the self-emptying base, which has a large holding capacity equivalent to 30 dust bins. It can hold up to 2000m² area of dust. Greatly reduces the frequency of dust disposal by yourself, keeps you hands clean at all time. Moreover, you’ll be worry free from bacteria and odor with its unique antibacterial and deodorizing system. Simply dispose the bag whenever it’s full. XCLEA H30 Plus Working Test

The big suspension suction inlet is close to the ground for deep cleaning, which greatly enhance the cleaning efficiency. Easily get all the embedded dust out of floor's grooves.  XCLEA can sense the environment and figure out an optimized cleaning routine instead of spinning around randomly. The LDS 4.0 LIDAR Navigation and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) Technology makes XCLEA the smartest ever just like a super-intelligent robotic “brain”. Utilize a various of detection sensor, infrared cliff, wall, collision sensors plus electronic compass, accelerometer, speedometer etc. XCLEA can 360° scan around to memorize its position and planned route, that can prevent it from falling down the stairs, get rid of common pitfalls, find its way out of trouble spots and keep all your valuables safe.   With the latest map management system, the AI algorithm allows XCLEA to partition your home map into individual rooms and identify different area to make it easier for spot cleaning. You can even merge, label and rename the rooms. Achieve preset cleaning route or schedule the time to clean designated rooms. Cleaning has never been so easy! Unlike many traditional robot vacuums, XCLEA can recognize different floors of a home and save the maps automatically which is great for multi-level homes.

<p><b>Will Gear work with my window shade?</b> <br/>Gear is designed to be compatible with any window treatment that is controlled by either a chain or a cord loop. This would include all types of roller and solar shades, and even many vertical blinds, venetian blinds and draperies - regardless of brand. <br/>If you are still unsure, please send in a photo and description of your window shade to <a href=""mailto:hello@axis.life"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">hello@axis.life</a>.</p>
<p><br/><b>Is Gear strong enough to lift my shade?</b> <br/>Gear can easily lift up to 20 lbs, far exceeding the weight of your normal window shade. To compare, most window shades found in homes require 7-8 lbs of pull force. Larger window shades (think floor-to-ceiling condos) require 10-15 lbs of pull force. </p>
<p><br/><b>How do I install Gear?</b> <br/>Installing Gear is incredibly simple and takes just a few minutes. First, screw in the provided mounting bracket onto the window frame next to your shade’s chain. Then, simply loop the chain around Gear’s sprocket and then snap the device onto the bracket. All that’s left to do then is to connect the solar power module to the main body of Gear. Then, make sure to attach the solar panel onto to the window. Done like dinner! </p>
<p><br/>
<b>How do I control Gear?</b> <br/>There are two convenient ways you can control your Gear. Using the downloaded smartphone app, you can lower and raise a specific shade or multiple shades from the comfort of your phone. But what happens when you are already next to the window? It would be a hassle to take out your phone just to lower the shade! That’s why Gear features on-device controls, which allows you to lower and raise that specific window shade or all of the shades within a room from the device itself. </p>
<p><br/>
<b>Can I still manually control my shade using its chain/cord loop?</b> <br/>Absolutely! Unlike other motors, Gear has been designed so that you can still manually control your window shade using its chain. There are two different ways of doing this:<br/><br/>Option 1: Tugging on your shade’s chain will send a notification to Gear, automatically raising or lowering the shade, based on the direction of the tug. <br/><br/> Option 2: Pressing the power button will disengage Gear from your chain, allowing you to manually control the shade using the chain with the Gear still in place. To turn it back on, just press the power button again. </p>
<p>  <br/>
<b>Does Gear work with smart home systems and other connected devices?</b> <br/>While we believe Gear works great as a standalone device, its true potential is unlocked when it works together with a variety of connected devices. To that end, our team is hard at work building integrations with leading smart home systems and connected devices and designing a slew of IFTTT scenarios. We will keep you posted as these develop. </p>
<p><br/>
<b>Will Gear work with my phone?</b> <br/>Gear will initially launch on iOS and Android with support for other operating systems to follow shortly afterwards. </p>
<p><br/>
<b>How is Gear powered?</b> <br/>We have designed Gear to be a completely wireless solution. It is powered by a combination of a replaceable set of alkaline batteries, a rechargeable LiPo battery and a solar panel module designed to work indoors. The alkaline batteries alone are tested to power the Gear for 1 year of normal usage. Normal usage is defined as completely raising and lowering your shades - 2 times a day. The solar panel module will fit snugly behind the top of your shade and ensure that you never have to worry about replacing batteries - ever! </p>
<p><br/>
<b>When can I expect to receive my Gear?</b> <br/>The estimated shipping date is October 2016. With that said, we are working hard to have your Gear available to you before then. We have already set up our supply chain and struck agreements with our manufacturing partners. Once we wrap up this campaign, we will enter into the design for manufacturing phase, then tooling and molding followed by the actual production run. We promise that we will keep you updated every step of the way so that you are never in the dark about when your Gear will arrive. </p>
<p><br/>
<b>My question wasn’t answered. How can I contact you?</b> <br/>You can always reach us at <a href=""mailto:hello@axis.life"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">hello@axis.life</a>! We’re open to any questions, comments or suggestions so don’t hesitate to get in touch. We would love to hear from you!</p>

For too long, the smart home revolution has neglected window shades. AXIS has set out to transform this with Gear, the first ever smart device that motorizes your window shades. With built-in sensors, AXIS Gear allows you to automate the opening and closing of your shades, adding comfort, convenience, and safety for you and your family.Traditional motorization can cost upwards of $400 per window. AXIS Gear is an affordable luxury that only costs $145. Amazing, or what?

On-device controls allow you to control your shades with the touch of a finger. Group Mode allows you to control multiple shades from a single Gear.


Wake up to sunshine and forget the annoying, heart-wrenching alarm clock. Let the sun warm up the room before you leave your cozy bed.



Use Gear’s mobile app to create and customize a schedule to set when your window shades open and close.


Video demonstration below:



Convenience & Accessibility
Open or close your shades in perfect unison, and control heavy or hard-to-reach shades, all from the comfort of your bed or couch. 
Energy Savings
Cut your energy costs by reducing your reliance on A/C and heating throughout the year. Warm up any room with natural sunlight, and keep heat in by closing the shades when it’s cold.
Luxury 
Wow your guests with a touch of a button. Set the mood or turn your living room into a home theatre. 
Security & Privacy
Come home in the evenings to much-need privacy. Simulate presence when you are away from home, or send alerts to your mobile phone to report any suspicious motion or activity by your windows.
Child & Pet Safety 
According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, there have been 285 incidents due to strangulation in the past 19 years. Gear eliminates this danger by preventing the chain/cord loop from dangling freely, giving you peace of mind.



Regardless of how big, small, heavy or light your shades are, Gear works with:



Gear works with all beaded chains, cord loops, and connectors in any material or size. Installing Gear is as easy as 1-2-3: 



 

Install the provided mounting bracket on to your window frame. 



 

Attach the beaded chain or cord loop of your window shade onto Gear. 



 

Snap Gear onto the mounting bracket.






The provided mounting bracket will allow you to install Gear on both inside and outside mounts, regardless of whether the chain or cord loop is positioned to the left or right of your shade.

Video demonstration below:






Our smart home module lets you integrate Gear with other Smart Home devices that run on Z-Wave or ZigBee such as: 



SmartThings
Nest (via Weave)
Logitech Harmony
Fitbit and Jawbone
Homey


 







 



This add-on vastly extends your range of control and is highly recommended for larger homes. Interested? Add $20 at checkout for each Gear you order.

Using the downloaded smartphone app, you can lower and raise a specific shade or multiple shades from the comfort of your phone. But what happens when you are already next to the window? It would be a hassle to take out your phone just to lower the shade! That’s why Gear features on-device controls, which allows you to lower and raise that specific window shade or all of the shades within a room from the device itself. 

Can I still manually control my shade using its chain/cord loop? Absolutely! Unlike other motors, Gear has been designed so that you can still manually control your window shade using its chain. There are two different ways of doing this:Option 1: Tugging on your shade’s chain will send a notification to Gear, automatically raising or lowering the shade, based on the direction of the tug.  Option 2: Pressing the power button will disengage Gear from your chain, allowing you to manually control the shade using the chain with the Gear still in place. To turn it back on, just press the power button again. 
  
Does Gear work with smart home systems and other connected devices? While we believe Gear works great as a standalone device, its true potential is unlocked when it works together with a variety of connected devices. To that end, our team is hard at work building integrations with leading smart home systems and connected devices and designing a slew of IFTTT scenarios. We will keep you posted as these develop. 

Will Gear work with my phone? Gear will initially launch on iOS and Android with support for other operating systems to follow shortly afterwards. 

How is Gear powered? We have designed Gear to be a completely wireless solution. It is powered by a combination of a replaceable set of alkaline batteries, a rechargeable LiPo battery and a solar panel module designed to work indoors. The alkaline batteries alone are tested to power the Gear for 1 year of normal usage. Normal usage is defined as completely raising and lowering your shades - 2 times a day. The solar panel module will fit snugly behind the top of your shade and ensure that you never have to worry about replacing batteries - ever! 

When can I expect to receive my Gear? The estimated shipping date is October 2016. With that said, we are working hard to have your Gear available to you before then. We have already set up our supply chain and struck agreements with our manufacturing partners. Once we wrap up this campaign, we will enter into the design for manufacturing phase, then tooling and molding followed by the actual production run. We promise that we will keep you updated every step of the way so that you are never in the dark about when your Gear will arrive. 

My question wasn’t answered. How can I contact you? You can always reach us at hello@axis.life! We’re open to any questions, comments or suggestions so don’t hesitate to get in touch. We would love to hear from you!",52.0,2,"2 Campaigns

<p>Unfortunately, not everything on the internet is true, no matter what the internet tries to tell you. Over the past four years one of the internet's favorite political memes is of ""Uncle Joe Biden."" It started with an<a href=""http://www.theonion.com/articles/shirtless-biden-washes-trans-am-in-white-house-dri,2718/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""> Onion article</a> which poked fun at the Vice President because of his blue collar mannerisms and forthright speech when discussing... well... anything.</p>
<p>Joe Biden has made a career about speaking what he means, regardless if it is in his best political interest or if it is the ""politically correct"" thing to say. Because of this he endures jokes regarding his ""gaffes"" and verbal miscues; and America (and some of the rest of the world) laugh and chuckle about this Homer Vice President of ours.</p>
<p>All the while, Joe Biden has calmly and quietly been an incredible Vice President. He was one of the first politicians to <a href=""http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/06/nation/la-na-biden-gay-marriage-20120507"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">publicly embrace gay marriage</a> and may have been personally responsible for President Obama coming out in favor of gay marriage and the subsequent change in the Democratic Party's platform. He is also a stunningly intelligent politician who understands the nuance of foreign and domestic policy. He is also not afraid to show disdain for factually deficient arguments.</p>
<p align=""center""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbrau7H2FX1rg2rf7o1_500.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In order to let Vice President Biden know just how much we appreciate him, while also making a very silly part of the internet come true (we are the internet after all), let's buy Uncle Joe a Trans Am like the one that is featured in <em>The Onion’</em>s article.</p>
<p>Now, <strong>Uncle Joe won't be able to accept</strong> this behemoth of steely American grace and power. He has these pesky laws and regulations and political-y things to deal with. Taking into consideration his magnanimity and power of personality, he probably wouldn't be able to drive the Trans AM without the gnashing of teeth and wailing of women anyways. .</p>
<p><strong>So </strong><strong>the internet will purchase the car and auction it off for charity</strong>. All proceeds will be distributed to the Biden Breast Health Initiative, Doctors Without Borders, the Wounded Warrior Project and GLAAD.</p>
<p>Maybe if we ask nicely, Joe Biden will wash it on the White House lawn.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Are you guys serious?</strong></p>
<p>A: Well, we're serious about this, but not much else.<br/><br/><strong>Q: How did this start?</strong></p>
<p>A: A <a href=""http://www.fark.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Farker</a> by the handle ""Hack Patooey"" suggested that the Internet should buy Joe Biden a Trans Am. After some discussion in the <a href=""http://www.fark.com/comments/7378216/I-think-we-should-get-internet-to-buy-Biden-a-Trans-Am-Update-donation-link-now-LIVE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">thread</a> it was determined that the lulz would be too much to pass up. This site was started and the wonderful denizens of Fark started to donate and spread the word. <br/><br/><strong>Q: So this was just a random thing... give a Trans Am to the Vice President?</strong></p>
<p>A: The original impetus of this campaign was an article published in <em>The Onion</em>, a satirical publication, describing Joe Biden washing a Trans Am in the driveway of the White House. This has become one of the more amusing political memes: the plain talking Joe Biden as everyman, the guy who would pound a tallboy of Icehouse and spend an afternoon detailing his Trans Am.<br/><br/><strong>Q: Are you really going to give Joe Biden a Trans Am?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes. Should a car be purchased, we will find a replica and miniature Trans Am of a similar year and color to give to him. T<strong>he actual Trans Am will hopefully be auctioned off with the proceeds going to benefit our four charities.</strong> <br/><br/><strong>Q: OK... so what ARE you going to do with the Trans Am?</strong></p>
<p>A: Ideally, we're going to buy the car, get it to Washington, D.C. and hopefully have the Vice President take a photo with it. Whether or not that works out,<strong> <strong>we'll be auctioning the Trans Am and the proceeds will be donated to four charities.</strong></strong></p>

<p>A: This isn't a political thing. It is an Internet thing. For some reason people cannot comprehend this.<strong>ALL PROCEEDS ARE GOING TO CHARITY. </strong><br/><br/><strong>Q: Which charities will be getting the money?</strong></p>
<p>A: Doctors Without Borders, GLAAD, The Wounded Warrior Project and The Biden Breast Health Initiative. Each will receive 25% of the funds at the end of the project.<br/><br/><strong>Q: Why not donate the money directly to charity?</strong></p>
<p>A: Because this way we get to have some fun and hopefully use the popularity of the Vice President, the silliness of making a meme become a reality and the nature of the Internet to make it possible to donate even more to these great causes.<br/><br/> And because we're buying a biatchin' Trans Am for the Vice President!<br/><br/><strong>Q: What happens if you don't raise the target of $25,000?</strong></p>

We will still send a die-cast Trans Am with a card of all contributors’ names/avatars to the Vice President. :)<br/><br/><strong>Q: What happens if you raise MORE than the target of $25,000?</strong></p>
<p>A: Anything not spent on donor perks, the Trans Am, taxes, licensing and delivery will be divided equally among the four charities.<br/><br/><strong>Q: Is anyone on this team getting a share of this money?</strong></p>
<p>A: Not one thin dime. Everything that isn't going to expenses like IndieGoGo's fee, donor perk costs, taxes and so forth will go to the charities. Nobody here will be taking any money you donate.<br/><br/><strong>Q: How can we be sure this isn't a scam?</strong></p>
<p>A: Well, we've got a lot of credibility on Fark; the admins there know who we are and the creator of this IndeiGoGo campaign is a lawyer who is not going to risk his law license to take money away from charities. But in the end, we can't really give you ironclad assurance; this is not a 501(c) or anything like that.<br/><br/> If you don't feel comfortable contributing to this campaign, please consider a direct contribution to one of our four charities.

<p>A: No. If you want to make a tax-deductible donation, you can directly donate to the causes in question.<br/><br/><strong>Q: This is stupid, Joe Biden can afford his own Trans Am!</strong></p>
<p>A: Please, for all that is holy and sacred please read the above part of the FAQ. Then read the front page of this campaign and then watch the YouTube video.

<p>A: If you don't want to support our campaign, please consider a direct donation to one or more of the charities we're supporting.<br/><br/><strong>Q: Who's behind this?</strong></p>
<p>A: This started with several Farkers.

Joe Biden loved his Trans Am. As soon as it reached about 40 degrees in Scranton, PA, Ole Joe would pull the cover off of his beloved beauty and spend hours detailing her immaculate curves. He'd often be overheard murmuring how sweet his ""Bird"" was which was completely opposite to his normally gruff demeanor. It also made certain Senate Foreign Relations Committee meetings very awkward.
Senator Biden, now Vice President Biden, has always been known for his fiery and passionate speech and mannerisms. But when he looked at the Bird, he'd hitch up his jorts, rip off of his shirt sleeves and chug a sixer of Ice House.
It was love.
Then came the Great Recession.

She is sharing a tiny bedroom with my husband and myself due to unfortunate circumstances. Her bedroom flooded during a heavy rainstorm and insurance would not cover it. The carpet and walls are moldy and the air is stale. My husband and I both work but do not make enough money to buy her a bed or fix up her bedroom. This breaks my heart. It hurts when Sonia asks me ""Mommy when am I going to have my own big girl bed?"" and ""Why don't I have my own room--I want Mickey Mouse."" Times are very tough and I can deal with that, but it is not fair for a 3 year old to have to sleep in a crib that is too small for her in a cramped room with her parents. She should be able to have her own space. The flooded bedroom is tiny so it would be an easy project. We just need the funding to make it happen. Please help me with this. Every penny counts. Also, If there is anyone willing to volunteer to take care of the carpeting and painting that would be welcome too. I can take before and after photos and videos as well. Thank you everyone!

I do volunteer when I can (on weekends) mostly for the MS Society. The ability to help others is the best feeling in the world.</span></div>","My daughter Sonia is 3 years old and way too big for her crib. She is sharing a tiny bedroom with my husband and myself due to unfortunate circumstances. Her bedroom flooded during a heavy rainstorm and insurance would not cover it. The carpet and walls are moldy and the air is stale. My husband and I both work but do not make enough money to buy her a bed or fix up her bedroom. This breaks my heart. It hurts when Sonia asks me ""Mommy when am I going to have my own big girl bed?"" and ""Why don't I have my own room--I want Mickey Mouse."" Times are very tough and I can deal with that, but it is not fair for a 3 year old to have to sleep in a crib that is too small for her in a cramped room with her parents. She should be able to have her own space. The flooded bedroom is tiny so it would be an easy project. We just need the funding to make it happen. Please help me with this. Every penny counts. Also, If there is anyone willing to volunteer to take care of the carpeting and painting that would be welcome too. I can take before and after photos and videos as well. Thank you everyone!

<p>The idea for <i>tikr</i> came from playing with our dogs Misha and Aure. Our dogs love to play.

It wasn't terribly fancy, but it was just what he really needed to use for a lot of what he does in terms of designing cool stuff and just playing games. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, last month we let this long-haired blonde asshole from Portland named Matthew Wolton live in our basement for a couple weeks. He was supposed to give us rent, but never did. Instead, two days after Evan's birthday party, he stole food from us, a gallon of bleach (?!) and of all things, Evan's tablet. </p>
<p>Although it's only a $200 tablet, we cannot afford to replace it right now as there's been a change in Evan's work and my job situation hasn't picked up.  So I'm selling either my comic books or original art that i will create for you specifically to try and get him a new tablet. </p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I'm not asking for much, and i'm NOT asking for handouts. I am offering either comic books that I've created and are in stores now in Albuquerque, Dallas and Los Angeles, or brand-new created just for you art work! My strength is in character drawings, so that's what I'm offering. </p>
<p>Need a picture of you and your dogs? I can draw it.</p>
<p>Want a cool comic book character drawn by a comic book artist to put on your wall? I can draw it. </p>
<p>Do you like some of the other drawings I've done for Inktober? Most are available!</p>
<p>Have you missed one of the EIGHT books I have in stores? I can sell them to you direct!</p>
<p>Want them signed by the artist? That's me, so I can do it!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I love Evan and I really want to replace his tablet. It's not much, but any help anyone wants to give would be greatly appreciated. I don't even need much. The campaign has a minimum of 500$, but I really only need about 250$, so unless there's some crazy demand for my art, I will close the campaign once i reach the 250$ mark </p>
<p><br/></p>

</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>There are no risks. You are helping me get my baby a new tablet and you are getting artwork. It's win-win, baby!</p>

Need a picture of you and your dogs? I can draw it.
Want a cool comic book character drawn by a comic book artist to put on your wall? I can draw it. 
Do you like some of the other drawings I've done for Inktober? Most are available!
Have you missed one of the EIGHT books I have in stores? I can sell them to you direct!
Want them signed by the artist? That's me, so I can do it!


  The Impact I love Evan and I really want to replace his tablet. It's not much, but any help anyone wants to give would be greatly appreciated. I don't even need much. The campaign has a minimum of 500$, but I really only need about 250$, so unless there's some crazy demand for my art, I will close the campaign once i reach the 250$ mark 


  Risks & Challenges There are no risks. You are helping me get my baby a new tablet and you are getting artwork. It's win-win, baby!


  Other Ways You Can Help If you cannot buy online, meet up with me, or simply buy my book in stores. It's in every comic store in Albuquerque, ""The Comic Book Store"" in Dallas and ""Comic Book Hideout"" In Los Angeles.",0.0,0,"9 Campaigns

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>We are 32 Square- a design and fabrication shop based out of Brooklyn, NY. We want to build you some dinosaurs!</b></p>Let's get to know each other. 32 Square = 32 square feet = 1 standard sheet of 4’ x 8’ material. We design custom furniture, props, and installations for the arts and entertainment industry using the idea of maximum production with minimum waste as a guiding aesthetic. From modular objects to custom décor built from repurposed offcuts, we are design one sheet at a time.

<p><b>Our newest project:</b> Our designers and crew grew up with hands-on toys. From erector sets to capsella to LEGO, all of our favorite things involved the joy of putting something together. We have been developing a series of designs based on the punch-out balsa wood dinosaur puzzles we had as kids, but updated with bright and exciting materials, intuitive assembly, and a massive increase in scale. The balsa puzzles were a joy to put together, but the final product was always a bit of a letdown- we want to make design objects that are as sturdy and visually interesting as the dinosaurs that inspire them. </p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I am the author of a growing series of children’s books published by Schiffer Publishing, Ltd. entitled “Rupert’s Tales,” a regular contributor to “Pooka Pages,” an online magazine published eight times annually, I perform “Rupert’s Tales and Tunes” at a wide variety of Pagan festivals, activities and events, and I produce the web-based TV program, “Friends of Rupert Show” through the Illuminati Network which focuses on teaching children Pagan traditions and practices through stories, songs, humor, demonstrations, and short films.</p>
<p>Our Friends of Rupert team has been an official Adopt-A-Road crew, helping to care for Mother Earth, for three years.  And our Hands of the Goddess team helps to support a local women’s’ homeless shelter, along with a wide variety of others who require assistance when they encounter a crisis in their lives.</p>
<p>Since the end of December, we have experienced a series of escalating incidents at our home, which we have affectionately dubbed “The Glitter Dome,” culminating in the use of firearms shot into our occupied home, and acid bombs thrown in our yard, narrowly missing our grown daughter.  She received treatment for chemical inhalation as a result .</p>
<p>Because the investigation of the incidents mentioned is on-going, we cannot share all the specifics with you at this time.  What we can tell you is that, because of the language used during some of the incidents, there is absolutely no doubt whatsoever that these crimes have been perpertrated against us because of the fact that we are Witches and Pagans.</p>
<p>Lady Liberty League,  the religious freedom and civil rights organization sponsored by Circle Sanctuary, an international Wiccan church and Pagan resource center headquartered in Wisconsin which provides information and networking assistance to individuals and organizations with religious freedom issues pertaining to Wiccan ways, Paganism, and other forms of Nature religions has provided a variety of resources to my husband, Randy, and me during this time.  They also provided a comprehensive on-site Threat Assessment Report of our home in an effort to de-escalate the situation and provide long-term safety for our family.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are seeking assistance to comply with the security measures recommended by Lady Liberty League.  The bulk of the funding received will be to purchase the security cameras necessary to provide surveillence of our unique, colorful home.  The cameras would provide visible deterents to those who would seek to further harass and intimidate us, as well as a means to secure evidence should additional incidents occur.</p>
<p>I am unable to share specific details of the additional security measures recommended by Lady Liberty League in order to maximize the effectiveness of those measures.  You may be assured, however, that full transparency will be shared with the appropriate staff of the Lady Liberty League organization.</p>
<p>What we offer in return for your donation is the opportunity to get your very own Rupert  swag!  Usually, these items are only available at a “Rupert’s Tales and Tunes” performance, as they are specifically created just for these events.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If we are successful in funding this campaign, you will be helping our family to continue to move forward with confidence and safety so that additional Rupert’s Tales stories, songs and episodes can be created in an environment filled with peace, friendship, and lots of reasons to giggle!</p>
<p>You will also be helping to send a resounding message of unity and support so others of Nature-based faiths will understand that none of us is alone.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Whether you are able to contribute or not, please share this campaign with others far and wide.  Not so much, perhaps, as a way to ask for donations, but as way to spread the awareness that we are here and we taking care of each other, no matter which path we may walk; no matter which deity/deities we may serve.</p>
<p>And, while you’re at it, watch, “Like” and share our videos on our Friends of Rupert channel here:  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/friendsofrupert"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.youtube.com/friendsofrupert</a></p>

The Ministry of the Environment is yet to rule on the more than 80 appeals for a more complete Environmental Assessment, including revisiting alternatives.A $37 Million four-lane bridge would cut through our scenic Jackson Park not far from this entrance and would be visible above the treeline at the back of this photophoto courtesy of Christy DonnellyOne of the majestic old growth pines which stands in the path of the Parkway's bridge through the wilderness of Jackson Park.
o  Fighting continued single zoned urban sprawl subdivisions in favour of redeveloping the city core.  Especially massive developments like Lily Lake, which would place 8,000 people on the lip of Jackson Park. Due to concerns about the impacts on the natural environment, capital and infrastructure expenses, and long-term sustainability of Peterborough, this proposal has been appealed to the Ontario Municipal Board.
The farm on the left is part of the 500 acres which will be the site of Lily Lake Development. It will abut a Provincially Significant Wetland containing Lily Lake to the right side of the photo.photo courtesy of Wayne EardleyThe full site of the proposed development is all the farmland to the right of the road. Jackson Creek Trail is in the thin line of trees at the edge of the fields and the Provincially Significant Wetland containing Lily Lake is at bottom right.photo courtesy of Wayne Eardley                                                                              Please Help us in our CausePeterborough Greenspace Coalition is an 
all volunteer, community, non profit organization and although we have a
 number of people with various expertise on the environment etc., we are
 in need of hiring the occasional expert in the field of urban planning 
and traffic engineering to support our arguments to the Provincial and 
Municipal governments.  This can be very expensive. We also are 
planning another advertising campaign to promote the importance of Smart
 Growth and Sustainability for our City during the current Municipal 
Election.  We would like to make it clear that this fundraising campaign is
 not raising funds directly for individual candidates, nor will the PGC be donating funds
directly to any candidates. We will, however, be endorsing candidates with a more sustainable view for Peterborough and we encourage you to support the candidates of your choice with such a sustainable vision. We rely on the generosity of those of like mind in 
our community to help fund our goals.  Won’t you join us and help Change
 the Balance!For more information on our organization and our campaign to elect a more sustainably minded City Council visit our website at:                                    http://parksnotparkways.ca/

</h2><p>Founder &amp; Design engineer of the Broman razor, is Dan Skinner. From children's products for LEGO and Disney, watches for Swiss watch brands to Christmas decorations for Buckingham Palace, Dan has always enjoyed designing and making beautiful, exceptional quality products. But it was his own frustrations with his shaving experience which forced him to take action and develop a new type of razor - one that gives a better shaving experience that anyone can use at a reasonable price. Here's Dan sharing insight into the idea behind Broman: </p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/bmQbrcXISvM?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p>See for yourself how the Broman razor is different from the rest, an innovative, easy to use razor with a unique pivoting and flip open head that prevents razor burn &amp; doesn't clog, giving everyone the smoothest shave. </p><p>However, although the traditional safety and straight razors were the clear favourites for a better shave, men today don't have the time to re-learn how to shave with these traditional tools. So in developing the Broman razor we took the pivoting head features of a modern cartridge razor and combined it with a traditional razor making it easy for anyone to use. The spring loaded head supplies the perfect amount of pressure to allow the Swedish steel blade to glide across your face without any force. Everyone needs an alternative to cartridge razors &amp; expensive subscriptions - you deserve the best shaving experience.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508162873/lzjleaoc80i5mv7p945q.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>The Broman razor pivots to your face like a ballerina</i></p><p>The idea for the Broman razor was born - a hybrid of a modern pivot razor and a traditional safety razor using low cost, single edge blades.

</div></div>","Momo is the first home security assistant with artificial intelligence, all integrated into a discrete and timelessly stylish lamp that complements any living space. It simplifies life by making your home safer and smarter, while you enjoy more comfort, and greater efficiency.Home Security Momo is packed with standalone security features like motion detection, facial recognition, and intelligent sound detection, and applies its intelligence to any additional security systems and connected devices around your home. It will even apply motion detection and facial recognition to images from other connected cameras.Learn & Adopt IntelligenceMomo learns your habits and environmental preferences thanks to machine learning techniques, and suggests automations for your home to perfectly fit your lifestyle.Smart Home Super Hub Thanks to a full suite of connectivity systems and an open architecture, Momo can automatically sync with and manage nearly all smart home devices, including standard appliances plugged into smart plugs. Momo offers 24/7, intelligent standalone security, in addition to full compatibility with smart security sensors, even applying its facial recognition and motion detection to connected cameras to give you early warning of potential intruders, wherever you are, and without any subscription fee. Thanks to Momo's revolutionary AI capabilities, it can automatically arm your security when you are asleep or away from the home, provide live feeds of abnormal events detected, and even connect you with users in the home in the case of an emergency.Taking care of you, night and dayThrough its unique combination of artificial intelligence and inbuilt sensors for motion, sound, smoke and air quality, Momo protects your home proactively if abnormal or hazardous conditions are present, even when you leave the home or if you are asleep.Momo will learn the layout of the space it is in, along with the faces and behavior patterns of all residents and friends, provided they are ""introduced"" by a resident. With its rotating night vision camera, you can stream live video and keep an eye on the home when away. Momo will deliver auditory, light, and app alerts whenever strange motion, abnormal sounds, or changes in air quality alert it to something wrong in the home. Intelligent sound detection can tell the difference between normal home noises and sounds like a cry for help or breaking glass.Adding intelligence to home securityMomo's intelligence extends to connected security systems in the home, acting as a hub for conveniently controlling them all at once and making them smarter through its own AI features.Momo connects to wireless door or window sensors, moisture sensors, and additional security cameras, using them to recognize who is there and when they are moving. View all video feeds for connected cameras right from the Momo Home app. Stay in control wherever you areNo matter where you are, Momo will keep an eye on your home for you and keep you informed. Whether it's an emergency or you just want to check in on your loved ones, even in the next room, Momo allows wireless two-way video and audio communication.When it is connected to WiFi, Momo allows you to make and receive video calls through any connected AV device, like a tablet, computer, or mobile phone. You can also make WiFi voice calls using Momo's speaker and microphone. Momo allows a wide variety of remote functions, like remote activation of devices in Momo's network.Greater peace of mindMomo's standalone security features and networking capabilites allow it to fully protect your home, worry-free. Say you've just left the home. Momo will activate security mode, and alert you to any windows or doors equipped with sensors that have been left open. If you choose, it will generate a mock presence in the house by turning lights and music on or off periodically.If Momo detects something suspicious, such as an unknown presence or strange sound, it will send an alert to the user, sound an alarm, and can even turn on its light and any connected lighting. Stream video through the mobile app to see what triggered Momo. When you return home and Momo recognizes you, it will deactivate security mode.A healthier home Designed to maintain a healthy home environment, Momo’s sensors detect unsafe levels of gas or other pollutants, and check for poor air quality. Momo will send you an alert, flash, and/or sound an alarm to warn you to remedy unhealthy conditions.You will be able to see exact readings in the Momo Home app, stream video of your home through Momo's night vision camera, and communicate through Momo's speaker and microphones.Protecting your privacy tooYour privacy is incredibly important - that's why Momo uses 128-bit end-to-end communication encryption running on proven software, thanks to our partnership with Microsoft.And if you want absolute lock down, you can even choose to physically disconnect Momo's camera and microphone by simply rotating the shade to block them. Momo does not retrieve, store or share any personal data, and prioritizes in-house users' privacy over remote access requests. Momo does not require the internet to function within the home and your data is safely stored on its 256-bit encrypted internal memory.Momo uses machine learning techniques to learn your patterns of device use and behavior in the home, and suggest automations to make your life easier. Momo's AI will help you create the perfect home environment without having to spend hours managing technology.A lifestyle you chooseMomo learns your patterns of smart home device usage and behavior, and suggest sets of actions for you to adopt. We call it Learn & Adopt Intelligence.Say you get home from the office every day at 6:30. You turn on the lights, set the thermostat, play some music, and deactivate your home security. Momo can suggest this set of activities to all happen automatically when you get home each work day. It's your choice how to implement the automation: Now, Always, or not at all.When you leave the home, Momo can activate security, turn off the lights or turn off connected domestic appliances that have accidentally been left on, detect open doors and windows, and actively keep an eye on the house. Momo will even learn if you prefer to change a connected device's settings through that device's control panel, the Momo Home app, or to let Momo handle it automatically.You live - Momo learnsMomo is constantly learning, and will adapt to changing environments and situations. Momo will analyze its environment, and adapt to any changes it detects. It can turn on the lights when you enter the room, activate security when you leave the house, and alert you to any appliances that have been left on.It will suggest different sets of automation for the weekend, when your hours at home are different. It can adapt to being moved to a new location in the home, changing any settings and working with different devices. It will even suggest changes to automations you have adopted if your habits change.Momo is the ultimate smart home hub, allowing for a fully autonomous, managed experience. Momo amplifies the performance offered by each of your smart home devices by combining and coordinating their features to maximize the overall living experience.No other smart home hub offers the same artificially intelligent learning that Momo does. Manage all your devices through Momo manually, or let Momo do all the work; the choice is yours.Easy and intuitiveMomo can detect other smart home devices automatically - setting it up couldn't be simpler.Once you have downloaded the Momo app, you can make a profile, set your password, and add any additional users. Momo takes it from there - it will automaticaly detect devices it can connect to, and ask if you would like to add them to Momo's network.Universal compatibilityMomo runs on an open platform, and is the first smart home device that can work with all your other devices without losing any functionality.With Momo, the possibilities are endless. It will work with natural language virtual assistants like Google Home and Amazon Alexa. Whether you use the native apps for connected devices or the Momo Home app, you will not lose any functionality, and Momo will continue to learn your patterns and preferences. Stream your favorite web radio to connected Bluetooth speakers, set the thermostat to your perfect temperature, adjust the lighting - Momo will let you control any system with wireless connectivity. You can even connect to traditional appliances by plugging them into smart plugs and letting Momo know what appliance is connected. No more leaving the oven on - Momo will alert you if an appliance has been left on in an empty home.Form meets functionMost smart home devices are ugly plastic boxes, marring the aesthetic of your home. Momo is designed by a professional lighting design studio in Italy as a beautiful and functional lamp, with style that will stand the test of time.

Momo is discrete, and will blend into any room in the home while adding mood lighting you can fully customize. Use gesture control to brighten or dim the lamp, or change scenarios through the gesture-activated pre-set modes - for example, if you're having dinner with friends, using a pre-set mode you can tell Momo to automatically set a soft light, raise the thermostat to 72°F, and play your favorite music.

Once our campaign reaches $60,000, we will unlock our free More Power package. All Momos will be upgraded to an advanced Quad Core processor, 2GB of ram, a double-sized 32 GB HDD, and a larger back-up battery pack. This will make Momo work faster, letting its algorithms, facial recognition, motion detection and more work at peak capacity.

</div><p> </p></div>","Dan and his long legs: 
We gave Dan some extra long legs. This lets the bikes lean more towards the living space and allows for a staggering display of bikes. You can fit three (medium sized) bikes vertically on an eight foot high wall section.


Laser cut, bend and powder coated steel Made in the USA and GERMANY  
We want Dan to get to you as fast and affordable as possible. Shipping from two locations will allow us to ship easily to Europe, Canada and the USA. The German manufacturer will produce for the European market and the US manufacturer will produce for the rest of the world. 

You will have the choice between three different colors: Blue, White and Red

The things we use everyday should bring us joy.  
The end of the ugly and boring bike hook era is here. Dan comes with a set of googly eyes stickers that conceal two of the four screws. He usually prefers to look at your bike, but it is up to you what Dan is allowed to see.   
Every Dan comes with the KOM sticker kit.

The floor space is for living: 
Life is expensive and your bike is not paying any rent. Consider this, instead of building an addition on your house or a second garage, you could be hanging your bikes up on the wall. Saving yourself thousands of dollars, which could be used to buy more bikes :)


Risks & Challenges
With any project there are risks associated, however it is our job to make sure we minimize these risks for our backers.
Although we have tried to rule out any possible production delay through the prototyping process, there is always a chance that something unforeseen pushes a projects deadline further back. As a supporter, you will be getting updates on a regular basis and will be informed when a later arrival of your reward is anticipated. We are committed to offering the product as promised, if in the unforeseen event anything happens, we will alter our delivery time until our high quality standard is achieved.

<p> </p>There are many ways of cooking rice. But will it taste as good? During my travels in Japan and China I got to eat rice that had much more flavour than I had ever tasted before. That was not only because of the rice, it was mostly in the way it was prepared. (Being) cooked in ceramics makes rice especially tasteful. Back in The Netherlands I could not find a good and affordable ceramic rice cooker. I decided to design a great ceramic rice cooker, for easy and delicious rice, myself.<p> </p>
</div><div><img alt=""Prototype AZUME Ceramic Rice Cooker"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/952/843/9aefda201b7fbe4dcb0662156532c600_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1461241756&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=e2a30e6e2c0f65f6343df9e59bad907d"" src=""""/></div><div>
<h3>TASTY - EASY - BEAUTIFUL</h3>
<p>The AZUME Ceramic Rice Cooker is the result. An elegant pot that is practical and affordable. Rice is especially suited for cooking in ceramics. Of course, you could use an electric rice cooker, but who needs extra cords and plugs in the kitchen? Ceramics are also very sustainable in production and use. No plastic parts or electronica parts that can break down. A ceramic rice cooker will last you much longer than any electric rice cooker. Cooking in ceramics is a lot of fun as well. It always works out and the thick bottom prevents the rice from burning. The rice doesn’t just taste delicious; it looks great as well. Instead of a basic side dish, this rice will complete your meal.</p>

<h3>WHY DOES RICE TASTE BETTER WHEN COOKED IN THE AZUME?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>You can cook rice in any pan, but not every pan will give you the same tasty result. </p>Cooking any rice, you should first rins it thoroughly, let it soak, cook it for a short time, turn of the heat and keep it covered. The rice will continue to steam until it’s done. Ceramics hold the heat very well and won’t let the rice cool down while letting it sit.</div><div><img alt=""Before cooking the rice you should first rins it thoroughly."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/953/391/d31adf4462c126e5475799237d3ae8d9_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1461245274&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=09f89dbbbb252bf94ff5200c6edaf764"" src=""""/></div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>BENEFITS</h3>
<p><b>TASTE</b></p>The glaze on ceramics is very inert and won’t give off any taste like metal often does. <p>We added some extra benefits like special rims in the lid. The rims make sure that any steam that condensates will drip nicely on the surface of the rice, so the top layer won’t dry out.</p> <img alt=""The rings inside the lid make sure that any steam that condensates drips nicely on the rice making sure the top layer won’t dry out."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/953/722/9ec0b238f4044bd0a696c56b54c978df_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1461247371&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=e26d5019106c0d20e16e33d564ee3240"" src=""""/>

<p><b>LOOKS: taste and style go together</b></p>
<p>Tasteful rice should be presented tastefully. The Azume Ceramic Rice Cooker is an elegant, stylized pan and a fine object for your kitchen or dining table. The colour of the pan contrasts with the rice and remains beautiful while using it on fire, you will not see the soot. <br/>The pan has a manageable size for 2 to 4 persons. <br/>A beautiful detail is the bamboo rice scoop, which you store together with the pan.</p>

<p><b>SUSTAINABLE</b></p>
<p>The Azume Ceramic Rice Cooker doesn’t use electricity and only needs a short time on the stove. The pan will last a lifetime. There are still Chinese Ceramic Pots from 4000 years ago. An electric rice cooker definitely won’t make that. </p>

This is how you cook Rice in the AZUME Ceramic Rice Cooker


 

 
AZUME Ceramic Rice Cooker
After a successful Crowdfunding Campaign, we now offer you the AZUME Ceramic Rice Cooker as an InDemand offer here at INDIEGOGO. AZUME Ceramic Rice Cooker
 There are many ways of cooking rice. But will it taste as good? During my travels in Japan and China I got to eat rice that had much more flavour than I had ever tasted before. That was not only because of the rice, it was mostly in the way it was prepared. (Being) cooked in ceramics makes rice especially tasteful. Back in The Netherlands I could not find a good and affordable ceramic rice cooker. I decided to design a great ceramic rice cooker, for easy and delicious rice, myself. 

TASTY - EASY - BEAUTIFUL
The AZUME Ceramic Rice Cooker is the result. An elegant pot that is practical and affordable. Rice is especially suited for cooking in ceramics. Of course, you could use an electric rice cooker, but who needs extra cords and plugs in the kitchen? Ceramics are also very sustainable in production and use. No plastic parts or electronica parts that can break down. A ceramic rice cooker will last you much longer than any electric rice cooker. Cooking in ceramics is a lot of fun as well. It always works out and the thick bottom prevents the rice from burning. The rice doesn’t just taste delicious; it looks great as well. Instead of a basic side dish, this rice will complete your meal.



WHY DOES RICE TASTE BETTER WHEN COOKED IN THE AZUME?
 
You can cook rice in any pan, but not every pan will give you the same tasty result. Cooking any rice, you should first rins it thoroughly, let it soak, cook it for a short time, turn of the heat and keep it covered. The rice will continue to steam until it’s done. Ceramics hold the heat very well and won’t let the rice cool down while letting it sit.
 
BENEFITS
TASTEThe glaze on ceramics is very inert and won’t give off any taste like metal often does. We added some extra benefits like special rims in the lid. The rims make sure that any steam that condensates will drip nicely on the surface of the rice, so the top layer won’t dry out. 

 
LOOKS: taste and style go together
Tasteful rice should be presented tastefully. The Azume Ceramic Rice Cooker is an elegant, stylized pan and a fine object for your kitchen or dining table. The colour of the pan contrasts with the rice and remains beautiful while using it on fire, you will not see the soot. The pan has a manageable size for 2 to 4 persons. A beautiful detail is the bamboo rice scoop, which you store together with the pan.
 
 
SUSTAINABLE
The Azume Ceramic Rice Cooker doesn’t use electricity and only needs a short time on the stove. The pan will last a lifetime. There are still Chinese Ceramic Pots from 4000 years ago. An electric rice cooker definitely won’t make that.

No plugs and cords on the countertop
The AZUME takes up little space 
The AZUME is dishwasher proof (the bamboo scoop is not) 
The handles give good grip and don’t get hot 
The lid lies deep in the pan so when the water boils over it will drip back into the pan, and not all over your stove 
The pan is microwave proof

It was painstakingly engineered to provide a backyard fire experience that cannot be duplicated. Using our patented design and specialized construction process, we have created the most beautiful single unit fire pit ever. Prepare yourself to be wowed by the Bonfire's mesmerizing flames and come closer together with friends and family outdoors. Each portion of the bonfire is made of the highest grade 304 stainless steel and perfectly measured and formed. The bonfire presented us with some unique design challenges that required us to create custom tools.  These tools, along with a precision construction process, and intricate multi-step finishing and polishing process result in a product that is both beautiful and durable.The Bonfire is designed with a double wall to maximize the airflow of the burning process. The bottom holes allow oxygen to the feed the fire from below while simultaneously channeling warm oxygen up between the walls of the stove. This burst of preheated oxygen feeding back into the fire through the top holes causes a secondary combustion that results in a cleaner and more complete burn. A more complete burn means no more half burnt logs to deal with. It also means very little smoke which means no more dodging smoke that seems to follow your every move. A more efficient burn also means your wood will burn much longer compared to an open fire.  What Makes The Bonfire Special?Engineered Airflow Our proprietary design allows the Bonfire to utilize airflow in the burning process like no other fire pit.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are only asking for $2,000 to get the components necessary to make a working prototype and the small scale model with it. </p>
<p>We have two very exciting perks! The first one is getting bragging rights on our video credits. The second one is becoming affiliated in our final project report.  </p>
<p>First and foremost whatever funds go into this campaign will be to our projects benefit. We have included in the funding goal overhead costs that may arise if components fail or break. Once the small scale prototype is achieved then and only then would any funds left be used to facilitate the projects marketing needs. This could be via shirts, key-chains, business cards, etc. All of which would be available as perks later on.</p>

<div>While the Occupy movement had its origins in the east coast as Occupy Wall Street it quickly spread throughout the country with Occupies sprouting up in almost major city and even many smaller towns throughout the country and internationally. Early on with this movement much of the focus spread to Northern California, because of all the action that took place and continues to take place in this dynamic region. The Occupy movement soon became the voice of the disenfranchised; the people who have lost their homes, their children’s schools, and their jobs through corporate greed, but you won’t hear this voice on the mainstream media. The best way this voice will be heard is through independent, newspapers, websites, and other independent media outlets.</div>
<p> </p>
<div>As we attempt to break the iron grip of big corporations on our lives and our government the necessity of a media that represents the people is of paramount importance. If we want to bring this country back to the people we have to be able to discuss issues relevant to us and mainstream media with its content controlled by big corporations and big money is not the place to do this. In Northern California we want to be the free independent source for news written by the people for the people of the 99%. Our project is an eight page broadsheet style bi-lingual regional newspaper with a first print run of 10,000 with a complimentary website and multi-media exposure, which will inspire, motivate and further the efforts of the 99%. We intend to cover the area from north of the Golden Gate Bridge to Mendocino and Humboldt Countries with not only Occupy news, but news covering the important issues of our changing times. The emphasis will be on quality content featuring relevant news articles, editorials, a cultural section, photography, poetry, artwork and humor, all designed to make this a must read for those who want to keep abreast of the issues facing us. Our all-volunteer editorial collective is made up of twelve members with a wealth of journalistic backgrounds and with content contributors derived from the targeted general multi-ethnic community. The editorial collective is complimented by a Planning and Organizing board made up of a diverse group of representatives from the community.&gt;

&lt;p&lt; p=""""&gt;The money raised here will go towards funding the first two issues, but even if we don’t raise all of it we’ll still publish the first issue while we continue to raise money for the next issues. This is an all-volunteer effort with 100% of the money donated going directly into publishing and distribution. This is an ongoing project with the eventual goal to reach a larger demographical area and to also print a longer edition of the newspaper. We hope to become more than a newspaper by providing writing workshops to help prospective writers hone their writing skills and, at some point, offer other workshops to help educate the community we represent.

<p>Due to the overwhelming popularity of the Luma 900, we have made some design enhancements to the model. It will still include all of the features of our original prototype, plus a few new additions.</p>
<p><strong>Design Enhancement #1:</strong> The switch is now made of aluminum, for greater durability.</p>
<p><strong>Design Enhancement #2:</strong> The switch doubles as a charging and battery level indicator, with a dedicated LED that will turn red or green according to the battery level.</p>
<p><strong>Design Enhancement #3:</strong> Luma 900 now comes with a removable stainless steel belt clip for everyday carry.</p>
<p><strong>Design Enhancement #4:</strong> Luma 900 will now have a single Micro USB port on the body of the flashlight. This port has a rubber cover that makes it dust and moisture proof. We will still be providing a car charger with all Luma 900 flashlights, as well as a Micro USB cable, so you can keep Luma ready to go while you’re on the go.</p>
<p><strong>BONUS</strong> - Luma 900 flashlights will now have FIVE light modes! High, Medium, Low, Strobe and SOS.</p>

<p>High performance everyday carry flashlights that anyone can use. They are lightweight and small enough for a pocket or bag, and each comes with a storage case.</p>
<p>Three light modes means there is a setting for every occasion – from outdoor adventuring, to roadside emergencies, to looking for monsters under the bed. In fact, we can't think of a situation where Luma wouldn't come in handy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heading on a road trip? You should pack Luma.</li>
<li>Walking the dog at night? Better take Luma. </li>
<li>Lose something under the fridge? Grab Luma. </li>
</ul>
<p>Luma has you covered in any situation, so you’ll want to keep one close by.</p>

<p>Each Luma flashlight comes with two light diffusing cones and a car charger, which tuck away into a convenient case. Everything is right where you need it, when you need it.</p>

<p>Red and white diffuser cones easily slip on Luma flashlights, converting them into safety wands or lanterns. They are perfect for roadside emergencies, power outages, camping, crowd control, or even curling up with a good book.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>Luma flashlights have a rechargeable Lithium ion battery. This is important to us. You don't have to buy and throw away disposable batteries to keep Luma going, which means less batteries in the landfills and more money in your pocket. Each Luma flashlight comes with it's own car charger and can also be charged in any standard USB port. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>You can also use the handy car charger to charge your phone while you drive. It has a Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 USB port which will charge compatible devices 10x faster than a USB 2.0 port. It is backwards compatible for older mobile devices, and also has surge protection and short-circuit protection.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.nitegearpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/gif-10.gif"" src=""""/> </p>
<p>Luma is made of an aluminum alloy, so it's durable and lightweight - the perfect combo for everyday carry. It has an Ingress Protection rating of IP66, so you don't have to worry about rain or the occasional drop in a puddle (or snow bank) when the tail cap is screwed on.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520982725/wgy99krlo3ogdmfj6sbo.png"" src=""""/></p>

</div></div>","When we reach our stretch goal of $20,000, every flashlight ordered will come with a FREE bike mount!

Due to the overwhelming popularity of the Luma 900, we have made some design enhancements to the model. It will still include all of the features of our original prototype, plus a few new additions.
Design Enhancement #1: The switch is now made of aluminum, for greater durability.
Design Enhancement #2: The switch doubles as a charging and battery level indicator, with a dedicated LED that will turn red or green according to the battery level.
Design Enhancement #3: Luma 900 now comes with a removable stainless steel belt clip for everyday carry.
Design Enhancement #4: Luma 900 will now have a single Micro USB port on the body of the flashlight. This port has a rubber cover that makes it dust and moisture proof. We will still be providing a car charger with all Luma 900 flashlights, as well as a Micro USB cable, so you can keep Luma ready to go while you’re on the go.
BONUS - Luma 900 flashlights will now have FIVE light modes! High, Medium, Low, Strobe and SOS.




High performance everyday carry flashlights that anyone can use. They are lightweight and small enough for a pocket or bag, and each comes with a storage case.
Three light modes means there is a setting for every occasion – from outdoor adventuring, to roadside emergencies, to looking for monsters under the bed. In fact, we can't think of a situation where Luma wouldn't come in handy:

Heading on a road trip? You should pack Luma.
Walking the dog at night? Better take Luma. 
Lose something under the fridge? Grab Luma. 

Luma has you covered in any situation, so you’ll want to keep one close by.


Luma comes in two sizes: Luma 350 and Luma 900.

Each Luma flashlight comes with two light diffusing cones and a car charger, which tuck away into a convenient case. Everything is right where you need it, when you need it.
 

 
Red and white diffuser cones easily slip on Luma flashlights, converting them into safety wands or lanterns. They are perfect for roadside emergencies, power outages, camping, crowd control, or even curling up with a good book.
 

 
Luma flashlights have a rechargeable Lithium ion battery. This is important to us. You don't have to buy and throw away disposable batteries to keep Luma going, which means less batteries in the landfills and more money in your pocket. Each Luma flashlight comes with it's own car charger and can also be charged in any standard USB port. 
 

 
You can also use the handy car charger to charge your phone while you drive. It has a Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 USB port which will charge compatible devices 10x faster than a USB 2.0 port. It is backwards compatible for older mobile devices, and also has surge protection and short-circuit protection.
 
 
Luma is made of an aluminum alloy, so it's durable and lightweight - the perfect combo for everyday carry. It has an Ingress Protection rating of IP66, so you don't have to worry about rain or the occasional drop in a puddle (or snow bank) when the tail cap is screwed on.
 

 
Just how lightweight? Luma 900 weighs about the same as a D cell battery. Luma 350 weighs as much as a smallish apple. The diamond knurling on the handle allows for a comfortable, slip-free grip for big and little hands alike.

<p>Millions of children suffer from anxiety and sensory-related meltdowns, and it’s only growing worse*. Now, more than ever, we need tools that can help. Weighted objects such as blankets and vests have long been used in therapeutic settings. But, the calming benefit of deep pressure stimulation is still fairly unheard of in most parenting circles. </p>
<p>Meet FluffyWeight - melter of meltdowns, and dryer of tears. FluffyWeight is the softest, most huggable weighted plush on the market that also helps reduce meltdowns and soothe anxiety. With your generous support, FluffyWeight can help kids everywhere experience the calming benefits of weight.</p>

<h3>The softest, most calming hug you can imagine.</h3>
<p>When I designed FluffyWeight, I knew I wanted it to be plastic-free, non-toxic, durable and very safe for young children. Most weighted products are made with glass or plastic beads, which are not as comforting to hug, have chemical off-gassing, and could pose more of a choking risk.</p>
<p>That’s why I searched until I found a manufacturer who could make a natural, non-toxic latex filling. FluffyWeight is also double-lined, and made with a super soft, washable cover, making it as practical as it is huggable. </p>

<p><b></b><b>“What’s in the Box?!”</b> Pop up shop, is a revolutionary guerrilla project offering designed

<p>This Pop- Up-shop offers a new shopping experience: original design- objects set in
a magical though baffling environment and sold in simple cardboard blind- boxes
in three different sizes and prices. The shop, designed to erect in a few hours
at any given location, is intriguing and attractive, and the group of designers participating
in the event includes makers from various design fields, allowing a wide and
interesting range of products. The consumer/viewer is an
active participant in this event; it’s his or her choice whether to join the
game: to buy a product
that remains enigmatic and secretive until the blind-box is opened. In our shop
designers and buyers
actually give up control of what they sell and buy.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/478521/files/20140402081601-clf_iy.png?1396451761"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p>

do We Need?</b></p>
<p>We are asking for your support to help fund the cost of the cardboard boxes; the printing
of the posters that cover the walls of the  shop; the shipping and handling of the
products; professional photos of the products; a local team in Barcelona to
help us set up the shop; flights and 3 days sleeping accommodation. Every
donation will be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Our
minimum goal is to raise $12,000 which will cover the cost of the Barcelona
event. </p>
<p>If

“What’s in the Box?!” Pop up shop, is a revolutionary guerrilla project offering designed
products set in a new consumer environment that proposes a different shopping
experience. This project  promotes young
and promising designers, enabling them to reach new costumers and thriving
markets. 
This Pop- Up-shop offers a new shopping experience: original design- objects set in
a magical though baffling environment and sold in simple cardboard blind- boxes
in three different sizes and prices. The shop, designed to erect in a few hours
at any given location, is intriguing and attractive, and the group of designers participating
in the event includes makers from various design fields, allowing a wide and
interesting range of products. The consumer/viewer is an
active participant in this event; it’s his or her choice whether to join the
game: to buy a product
that remains enigmatic and secretive until the blind-box is opened. In our shop
designers and buyers
actually give up control of what they sell and buy.
The project was created as part of the Masters` degree program at
the Shenkar Collage of Design and Engineering. “What’s In the Box?!” was
presented at the opening of the Design Week 2013 in the Design Museum Holon www.dmh.org.il,
and as part of the opening events of the D’day’s Paris 2013 www.designersdays.comBut we can’t do it without you
After three successful events, in two countries (Israel and
France) we are currently invited to present at Barcelona Design week! Our shop
is a non-profit venue so funds raised at the event are all received by the
participating designers; therefore, it is impossible for us to keep this
wonderful event going on without your supporting donations. www.barcelonadesignweek.com  
THE BUDGET
To
make it to Barcelona Design Week we need about 20,000$, we got a wonderful
donation of 5,000$ but we still have a long way to go. 
What was in the box.What
do We Need?
We are asking for your support to help fund the cost of the cardboard boxes; the printing
of the posters that cover the walls of the  shop; the shipping and handling of the
products; professional photos of the products; a local team in Barcelona to
help us set up the shop; flights and 3 days sleeping accommodation. Every
donation will be greatly appreciated!
Our
minimum goal is to raise $12,000 which will cover the cost of the Barcelona
event. 
If
we manage to pass the necessary amount, the money raised on Indiegogo will enable us to start planning our
next event, and
thus ensure the long-term viability of this unique design/culture project.

<p>So here we are.. After a month and a half of testing, throwing, cutting, prying, you name it I've done it. To what  you ask? The newest knife made to work from Casey at ASD. I'm pretty rough on knives, I came across Casey through a friend of ours. I told him what I was looking for, and he told me he had the idea.</p>
<p>With that, comes the new knife (name TBD). I put it in my hands and I was shocked. The size, the balance, just the over all feel of this knife made me happy. I rushed home as fast as I could and went to work with it. I've cut a nylon tac vest, roof shingles, rope, cardboard, wire (covered in rubber), more nylon, a leather belt, t-shirt... The list continues, and so does this knife.</p>
<p>I was Leary at first of using the blade to cut, especially without gloves, in case I slipped. After I cut nylon with ease, I took the gloves off and went to town on the above listed items.. I never lost grip, this blade felt like it was a part of my hand.  I never found resistance with anything I cut. I was sold from this point on.</p>
<p>To cut the wire, I used the serrations on top of the blade to cut through the rubber and wire with ease. I used it against some wood and cut a pretty good chunk out of it. After all of this, the only thing that happened was I got tired. I was kind of annoyed that I couldn't defeat this blade on anything. I guess that was a good thing though!</p>
<p>After handing the blade around, I've had nothing but compliments. Mostly the same things I've repeated above. The feel of the knife is just amazing! </p>
<p>I've had people tell me numerous times they can't wait to even carry it for work. A couple people I showed (father-in-law and brother-in-law) asked if they could use it to field dress deer. Guess I'll have more videos during gun season!</p>
<p>All in all I would rate this knife an all around knife, it prys cuts and takes impact very well. No bends in the blade.</p>
<p>Cody</p>Thank you again for looking at our campaign to make the Centurion knife a reality, and thank you for your support!</div></div>","UPDATE: This project is fully funded via investors, and production starts January 2015!
You can still use this campaign as a discounted pre-order of The Centurion.
Before we begin ... full knife specifications and features are near the bottom of this page.  There is also a review from a police officer who's been field testing the knife.

You can see more pictures and learn more about this knife here.
A knife for law enforcement designed with law enforcement input I was approached by a member of local law enforcement about getting a knife that would meet the needs of officers without being too expensive.

As it turned out, I had a design in my head that matched up well with what officers were needing in a knife.  After discussing features they needed on their blades I set to designing a purpose built knife for law enforcement personnel with their input throughout the development process.

The unique nature of police work, and their personal gear, means most standard knives are not ideal.  Many are down right impractical.  Law enforcement has very specific needs in their blades.  This is the first knife to 'check all of the boxes' while meeting the price point the average officer can afford. 

Turns out hunters really like it too After going through the prototype phase I finally had a version of the knife ready for manufacturing.  It was time to put one in service with a police officer to field test, and show the other prototype off to retailers.
While in a business showing them my design, some deer hunters said if it was for sale they'd make it their hunting knife on the spot.  I'd never thought about this knife being a hunting knife, but several hunters have expressed interest in buying the knife once it goes into production.

<h3>What is the Sip-N-Oodle?</h3>
<p>The Sip-N-Oodle is a revelutionary new pool product designed to allow you to enjoy a cold beverage on a hot day while you enjoy the pool, ocean, lake, river, or whatever body of water you are in! You no longer have to fight to hold your drink above water or try to keep pool water out AND no more worrying if the kids are going to spill Red Kool-Aid in your beautifully clear pool.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 90px;""><img alt=""Having a drink in the pool is tricky business"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1284.photobucket.com/albums/a565/camtastic369/cupspill_zps27f1b60a.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Spilling a drink in your pool a sure way to ruin your day!""/></p>
<p>The Sip-N-Oodle is made of a foam pool noodle threaded with FDA approved plastic tubing that holds more than 16 ozs of any beverage you prefer. That's one full can! The foam noodle insulates the tube and keeps even frozen drinks cold on the hottest days of the year. In one end of the tube is a specially designed cap with a straw to allow you to drink hands free without getting out of the water or allowing water to get in. On the end of the straw is a convenient <strong>Bite Valve</strong> to make sure that nothing ever spills when you aren't using it. Cleaning is a breeze by simply removing the end cap and rinsing the tube. </p>

<h3>OK, I like it. What do you need?</h3>
<p>We need your campaign dollars to accomplish two major milestones. We already have the manufacturers of the component parts set up and ready to produce, but given that the parts are mostly small, minimum order quantities are quite high. First, your campaign dollars will allow us to purchase enough materials to manufacture a starting inventory and begin pursuing product placement in stores. </p>
<p>Secondly, we have an opportunity to secure a booth as a vendor at the International Pool, Spa and Patio Show in Las Vegas in November 2013. Securing that spot would mean exposure to nearly 200,000 people and nearly half that many small business in the industry around the world. Attending this expo would mean that the Sip-N-Oodle would be that much closer to landing in store near you!</p>

<h3>What will it mean if I contribute?</h3>
<p>To truely understand the impact of your contribution, you must first understand some back story. First, it is important to note that this is a family owned and opperated business. The company itself will be run be me, Cameron Parker, while my dad Chip Parker, the inventor of the Sip-N-Oodle, continues to create more fun and exciting new products for you to enjoy. We will be accompanied by a long time family friend and Marketing Professional, Greg Neely. My background is in high level manufacturing practices so one of the primary goals for the company is to assemble and produce the Sip-N-Oodle in the US to provide jobs for people in a desolate economy. I have had extensive training from leading industry professionals while working for a multimillion dollar corporation in Continuous Improvement and Better Business Practices so reaching the lofty goal of creating a new company to provide jobs is not outside my reach as a professional, provided I have the necessary capital to make it happen. Greg Neely, our Sales and Marketing President has lead a marketing team in South Atlanta with huge success over the course of his 26 year career. Greg has plans to provide jobs for salespeople and people desiring to become a distributor as well. My dad, Chip Parker has always had an eye for adapting and creating new things to make life easier and more fun. He already has several other products in the design phase to compliment the Sip-N-Oodle like a 2 Liter presurized cooler with a nozzle to make filling the Sip-N-Oodle easier and would make a great addition to any pool party! Also in design is a larger model to hold even more of your favorite beverage and interchangable sleeves with designs and even collegiate licensing. </p>
<p>All three of us have dreamed of one day owning a business of our own and providing people with a fun and usable product to make life a little bit better. We are confident that with the proper start up capital and support from people like you, we can make the Sip-N-Oodle a product available for everyone to enjoy AND provide jobs to people all accross the country. </p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>This was the design done to explain how the iFork line of flatware would keep germs off of your fork, knife and spoon and food off of your surfaces. We took a hanger and bent it... imagining the top section as the part of the fork with the prongs and the bottom part, the handle... CLEARLY this would not work but we had to start somewhere.</p>
<p>Designing the final product took many days and many dirty tables where we would eat and wish we had an iFork to solve the problem.</p>
<p>Some problems would be as simple as reheating food in the microwave and having no place to sit our forks down while our plates were heating up.  By now we all had become used to holding our forks in our hands for minutes, but we knew there was a better way. We forged on to solve this ever so simple problem of having to set our forks down without getting food residue from our forks onto the table or germs from the table onto our forks.</p>
<p>After many designs and ""microwaving moments"" the intelligently designed iFork line of flatware was created. </p>
<p>We also wanted to be able to create cool table settings and do something different... heck... maybe even stack our flatware in the order we should use each utensil when dining. We are not sure about you, but we always forget the order in which to use utensils when it comes to formal dining.</p>
<p>We are happy to say that we have solved these problems with the handcrafted, intelligently designed iFork line of flatware. The ""i"" in iFork represents that it is intelligently designed to keep the part that goes into your mouth from resting on surfaces.</p>

A tiny island of happiness!    The fact that this place does not look like this is entirely due to ourselves and perhaps we are not sincerely making the most of the great gift of faith.  _________________________________  WHAT WE WANT!  Religious conflicts are dark tapestries of hatred.

Our own faith is defended, fought for and enforced at the expense of peace. If the power of human conviction has so far prevented a better world, it is also capable of making it a reality.   We want to create a global movement in which the essence of faith, spreading goodness, is unleashed. Lighting a candle of hope and breaking through the darkness, in the name of every one of us.  _________________________________  HOW YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE!  Children are a great blessing and embody the cycle of life. Their presence radiates hope, love and faith in the future and as long as not every one of these young souls grows up with a smile on their face and can feel the great good of dependability, our work is not done.   Only together can we tackle these serious burdens and create a better world. Become a part of this global movement and give hope, confidence and security. Donate your contribution and lend a helping hand. Every single child will be deeply grateful for this gift. Cast your vote, because it is more valuable than you believe.  _________________________________  WHAT'S THE GOAL?  There are plenty of good solutions, only too few resources.   You donate a financial contribution for children in need, and we use the revenue to support selected projects to best benefit children in the world.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi everyone! My name is Ariel Wickers- I graduated from Brewster Highschool in June 2012. Several of my fellow ex-Brewster students and I recently saw an article in the local news about the fact that one of our old teachers, his wife, and his dog just had to escape a fire in their apartment. Luckily it appears that no one was hurt, but we know from past experience how devastating a fire can be, and want to raise money to give to their family to pay for any damages caused or necessary repairs. We want them to know that they're always in our thoughts, to know that our community stands behind their own, and to have the extra help they might need in this awful situation.</p>
<p>If you would like to see the full story, here is a link to the news article:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.lohud.com/article/20130827/NEWS02/308270017/Brewster-High-teacher-wife-escape-apartment-fire?odyssey=mod%7Cnewswell%7Ctext%7C%7Cp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.lohud.com/article/20130827/NEWS02/308270017/Brewster-High-teacher-wife-escape-apartment-fire?odyssey=mod%7Cnewswell%7Ctext%7C%7Cp</a><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We're not entirely sure how much in damages was caused by the fire, but we want to raise enough that, no matter what, the amount we donate has a substantial impact on their situation. That being said, indiegogo takes 4% of funds raised if you meet your goal and 9% if you do not. We'd like to raise at least $10,000 (if not more) because then we can still have a total of $9600 to give directly to the family. Regardless, even if we do not meet our goal, we will give any money we raise directly to them. Again- THIS IS A STUDENT RUN FUNDRAISER. It is not run by the family, but it will be given directly to them. We're doing this as a show of appreciation for everything the Mullane family has done for us as a community, and to let them know that they are certainly not alone.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I imagine that most of the people who wind up seeing this fundraiser will probably be current or graduated Brewster students, or friends and family of those personally impacted. Still, whether you know Mr. Mullane and his wife or not, please understand how important they and the rest of the Brewster community are to us. Mr. Mullane truly takes his role as a Brewster teacher seriously, is constantly involved in the school's extracurricular activities, and works hard to ensure that all of his students have the support and resources they need to succeed in the classroom and beyond.  He and his wife are both well loved and well respected throughout the entire district, and it would mean a lot to us all if we could get all the help possible.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know that the economy is bad, and that times have been hard on everyone. If you can't donate (which we totally understand) please share this on Facebook and try to get the message out in any way you can think of! It's hugely appreciated!!</p></span></span></span></div>","Short Summary

<p>As a follow up to our very successful Kickstarter campaign, we're here on IndieGogo for round two of our Phoenix 3D Printer!</p>
<h2>""What makes your 3D printer so different than everyone else's?""</h2>
<p>At the San Mateo MakerFaire, virtually everyone we spoke to asked us this question. With so many printer models to choose from, we were glad to see consumers becoming better educated about their options in the ever-growing 3D printing market.</p>
<p>So what makes our printer different?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/126672/files/20131010230031-software.png?1381471231"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>It's the software.</h3>
<p>Our software makes 3D printing easier. It helps you manage your filament, grouping your STL files into logical groups, and a unique feature: print recovery mode. 3D printers are still susceptible to many flaws, including filament tangles and nozzle jams. Should something go wrong in the middle of your 12 hour print, you used to have to throw it in the trash and start over. With our software, we allow you to pause the print, fix your tangled filament or clogged nozzle, rewind the print to the point of failure, and try again. Our software also works directly with our iOS mobile app (Android version forthcoming).</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/126674/files/20131010230058-zaxis.jpg?1381471258"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Z Axis</h3>
<p>Most traditional 3D printers use threaded rods to drive their Z axis up and down. This has a few drawbacks. For one, it's very slow to move the build platform into position. Secondly, screws can be manufactured imperfectly, causing a pattern to be ingrained into your print. By eliminating the screw, and using a belt instead, our printer produces perfect walls and edges, and no wobble pattern can be seen.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/126676/files/20131010230124-extruder.jpg?1381471284"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Extruder</h3>
<p>Our extruder is designed to help prevent heat from traveling up the filament. Heat that travels up the filament can cause the filament to ""soften,"" which makes it less effective at pushing filament out of your extruder's nozzle.</p>
<h3>A warranty.</h3>
<p>Yes, we have a one year on parts and labor. The only thing it doesn’t cover is shipping the printer to us.</p>

<h2>Parts Library</h2>
<p>The more complicated your object, the more STL files you need to keep track of. By allowing you to group your STL files into “assemblies” and “projects,” you can keep better track of what you need to print.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/126689/files/20131010231126-printrecovery.png?1381471886"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<h2>Print Recovery Mode</h2>
<p>Did your filament tangle 70% of the way through your print? No worries, you can fix your filament, rewind your print, and try again. No other printer provides you with this flexibility.</p>
<h2>Mobile App</h2>
<p>Monitor your print progress or check estimated time remaining from your iPhone or iPad. An Android version is in the works!</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<h2>Integrated Diagnostic Tools</h2>
<p>We’ve rolled a variety of tools into the software to exercise each axis, print test patterns, Z-axis calibration, nozzle flush, etc.</p>
<h1>Production Plan</h1>
<p></p>
<p><b>Plastics</b></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Plastic resin casting is an exciting middle ground between the upfront tooling cost of injection molding and the speed of injection molding.  We will first create molds for the various printer components.  We will make as many molds as we have labor to assemble printers.  This may take us a week or two to finalize.  Once the molds are created, parts set up in 24 hours.  The only difference is molds are much cheaper to make than printers, allowing us to hire more people to build printers faster.</span><br/></p>
<p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Assembly and Testing</b><br/></p>
<p>It currently takes us approximately 3 hours to build one printer and test it.  As we grow and become more efficient, we believe this number could be cut even further.  With our core team of three people working 8 (or 9) hours per day, we could produce 9 printers per day, or 180 printers per month.  Obviously, if our campaign is successful, we're incredibly excited about the possibility of hiring more people to build printers.</p>
<p><b>Metal Parts</b></p>
<p>A vast majority of the non-plastic parts are acquired and used as-is, which leaves very little for us to do.</p>
<p><b>Electronics and Hardware</b></p>
<p>We have a specialist lined up who is going to be able to connect us to efficiently priced electronics manufacturing. This is the key component to our pricing model. Because we are using a readily available open source hardware component, the RAMPS card, we foresee no problems acquiring the card in bulk.</p>
<p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Software</b><br/></p>
<p>The software is almost “complete,” though no piece of software is ever complete. We plan on releasing regular updates to add new features, fix bugs, etcetera. The last major functionality we need to create is an installation tool. Once that’s complete, we’ll be ready to distribute it!</p>
<p><b>Timeline</b></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>We are starting to create molds for resin casting as soon as possible.</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Orders to China will be going out on approximately October 24.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>We expect a 6-8 week wait for those parts to arrive.  During this time, we will be casting as many parts as possible.</li>
<li>We will be fulfilling Kickstarter orders.  Our deadline for this is March, but we hope to be done even sooner.</li>
<li>IndieGogo orders will be fulfilled in pledge order.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h1>Shipping</h1>
<p>You may have noticed that shipping is not included in our pledge amounts.  This is because the cost of shipping the printer can vary quite drastically, even within the United States.  Almost everywhere in the lower 48 states will cost $50 or less to ship to.  You can get an <a href=""http://shipping.phoenix3dprinter.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">exact quote here</a>.  When we're ready to ship your printer, we'll contact you to collect your shipping information and payment.</p>
<h1>T-shirts!</h1>
<p>If you don't want a 3D printer, but still want to support our efforts to make 3D printing easier for the masses, you can pledge for a T-shirt!  The design we have in mind can be found in the ""Gallery"" tab</p>
<h1>Thank you!</h1>
<p>If you made it this far, congratulations!  We've come a long way since our first prototypes, and an even further way since our first 3D printer model.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We'd also like to express our thanks to the <a href=""http://reprap.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">RepRap</a> community, who've put the work into creating the RAMPS card.  While not much is out yet, you can find our open source work <a href=""http://github.com/ez3d"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">on Github</a>.</p>

More About the Software


Parts Library
The more complicated your object, the more STL files you need to keep track of. By allowing you to group your STL files into “assemblies” and “projects,” you can keep better track of what you need to print.



Print Recovery Mode
Did your filament tangle 70% of the way through your print? No worries, you can fix your filament, rewind your print, and try again. No other printer provides you with this flexibility.
Mobile App
Monitor your print progress or check estimated time remaining from your iPhone or iPad. An Android version is in the works!



Integrated Diagnostic Tools
We’ve rolled a variety of tools into the software to exercise each axis, print test patterns, Z-axis calibration, nozzle flush, etc.
Production Plan

Plastics
Plastic resin casting is an exciting middle ground between the upfront tooling cost of injection molding and the speed of injection molding.  We will first create molds for the various printer components.  We will make as many molds as we have labor to assemble printers.  This may take us a week or two to finalize.  Once the molds are created, parts set up in 24 hours.  The only difference is molds are much cheaper to make than printers, allowing us to hire more people to build printers faster.
Assembly and Testing
It currently takes us approximately 3 hours to build one printer and test it.  As we grow and become more efficient, we believe this number could be cut even further.  With our core team of three people working 8 (or 9) hours per day, we could produce 9 printers per day, or 180 printers per month.  Obviously, if our campaign is successful, we're incredibly excited about the possibility of hiring more people to build printers.
Metal Parts
A vast majority of the non-plastic parts are acquired and used as-is, which leaves very little for us to do.
Electronics and Hardware
We have a specialist lined up who is going to be able to connect us to efficiently priced electronics manufacturing. This is the key component to our pricing model. Because we are using a readily available open source hardware component, the RAMPS card, we foresee no problems acquiring the card in bulk.
Software
The software is almost “complete,” though no piece of software is ever complete. We plan on releasing regular updates to add new features, fix bugs, etcetera. The last major functionality we need to create is an installation tool. Once that’s complete, we’ll be ready to distribute it!
Timeline


We are starting to create molds for resin casting as soon as possible.

Orders to China will be going out on approximately October 24.

We expect a 6-8 week wait for those parts to arrive.  During this time, we will be casting as many parts as possible.
We will be fulfilling Kickstarter orders.  Our deadline for this is March, but we hope to be done even sooner.
IndieGogo orders will be fulfilled in pledge order.


Shipping
You may have noticed that shipping is not included in our pledge amounts.  This is because the cost of shipping the printer can vary quite drastically, even within the United States.  Almost everywhere in the lower 48 states will cost $50 or less to ship to.  You can get an exact quote here.  When we're ready to ship your printer, we'll contact you to collect your shipping information and payment.
T-shirts!
If you don't want a 3D printer, but still want to support our efforts to make 3D printing easier for the masses, you can pledge for a T-shirt!  The design we have in mind can be found in the ""Gallery"" tab
Thank you!
If you made it this far, congratulations!  We've come a long way since our first prototypes, and an even further way since our first 3D printer model.

We'd also like to express our thanks to the RepRap community, who've put the work into creating the RAMPS card.  While not much is out yet, you can find our open source work on Github.",13.0,0,"1 Campaign
