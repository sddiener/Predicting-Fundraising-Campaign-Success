<p><strong>SUMMARY: </strong></p>
<p>My name is Shea Lynn Baird. My husband, Stephen Barlow and I own a complimentary and alternative health office called Every Body Cleansing Studio in Santa Rosa, CA. One of the services we offered there was Colon Hydrotherapy. I have been a colon hydrotherapist for 12 years, my husband for 4 years. We have over 2000 clients.</p>
<p>On March 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2012, an investigator from the Medical Board of California closed us down under threat of immediate felony charges for ""practicing medicine without a license"" – for doing colon hydrotherapy.</p>
<p>We find ourselves engaged in a situation, the outcome of which will either have a negative or positive effect on the future of all California hydrotherapists (ALL hydrotherapists nationwide, actually), and more than likely on all <span>complementary</span> and alternative health care practitioners.</p>
<p>If colon hydrotherapy ceases to be in California it will not only be one less healing modality available to you, but it will also set a new precedent for the medical board to unconstitutionally apply the law in other situations of their choosing – and the power grab for <span>complementary</span> and alternative health care modalities will be begin in earnest.</p>
<p><strong>WE NEED YOUR HELP.</strong></p>
<p>Our minds boggle at the fact that our state has done this to us. We didn’t go looking to be the face of this fight. This fight found us. We not only do this for ourselves – simply because we’d like to go back to work now – but we do this for all. Your donations can help us actually see this situation through.</p>

<p><br/><strong>OUR STORY - THE SHORT VERSION: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>On March 22<sup>nd</sup> the Medical Board of California shut us down under immediate threat of felony charges, and up to 28 years in jail for ""practicing medicine without a license"" – for doing colon hydrotherapy.</li>
<li>We have been compliant with all guidelines set forth by the state, and the Medical Board investigator didn't care. </li>
<li>We were told that the ONLY WAY we could practice colon hydrotherapy in the state of California was if we were an MD, an ND or a surgeon, or if we were an RN working in a business owned (51% or more) by an MD, an ND or a surgeon.</li>
<li>We were lied to, threatened and denied time for legal counsel. </li>
<li>In the process of shutting us down the investigator made a threat to colon hydrotherapy as a whole.</li>
<li>At this moment we aren’t allowed to practice colon hydrotherapy and we have no income.</li>
<li>By default we have become the face of this fight – to protect colon hydrotherapy as an alternative health care modality in California, and nationwide – as well as all complimentary and alternative health care modalities as a whole.</li>
<li>It was clear within 2 weeks of the event that our Colon Hydrotherapy certification board was not going to help or support us in anyway. They claimed what has happened to us is an isolated incident, and have spent weeks distancing themselves from us with their language, and telling untruths about us. As of 5/6/12 it has been over a month since they've replied to an email, or we've even heard from them. </li>
<li>After meetings with 8 different lawyers we finally found legal assistance who believes we have a chance to overturn the unconstitutional action of the medical board. He has a plan and he is putting it in motion. </li>
<li>We are reaching out to you for support in fighting this because if we don’t reverse the action taken on us by the Medical Board of California, and if colon hydrotherapy ceases to be here, we know that the medical boards of other states will be watching and will follow suit. The medical boards will then begin their power grab for all complimentary and alternative health care modalities in earnest.</li>
</ul><div> </div>
<div>After several conversations with people in our industry, I realize there have been  many misconceptions and false beliefs about our situation. Realizing this has been both upsetting and eye-opening for me. It has shown me that even though I have tried to carefully explain the circumstances of our situation, people have a difficult time seeing beyond their own experiences and the assumptions they have formed because of those experiences. </div>
<div>
<p class=""p2"">So, to be incredibly clear I want to cut to the chase and spell a few things out. </p>
<p class=""p2"">THE MEDICAL BOARD INVESTIGATOR <strong>NEVER MENTIONED,</strong> NOR DID HIS VISIT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH : </p>
<ul class=""ul1"">
<li class=""li1"">Our website</li>
<li class=""li1"">Our advertising</li>
<li class=""li1"">The class of our device</li>
<li class=""li1"">Whether we had a prescription for our equipment</li>
<li class=""li1"">Whether we had a prescription for our supplies</li>
<li class=""li1"">Whether our clients had a prescription for our service</li>
<li class=""li1"">The situation in Texas or any other state</li>
</ul>
<p class=""p2""> WHAT <strong>HE DID SAY</strong> WAS: </p>
<ul>
<li class=""li1"">The state of California decided in July of 2002 that Colon Hydrotherapy is a medical procedure. </li>
<li class=""li1"">The ONLY WAY someone can practice colon hydrotherapy in the state of California is to be an MD, ND or a surgeon, or be an RN working for (in a business owned at least 51% by) an MD, ND or a surgeon. </li>
<li class=""li1"">That SB-577 did not cover us. In fact, we were told that the medical board doesn’t care about SB-577. </li>
<li class=""li1"">That he was fully aware that there are several other therapists in our area, and many more in California, and that we were just first. </li>
</ul>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
</div>
<p><strong>MORE DETAILED VERSION:</strong><strong>â€¨<br/></strong><br/>On Thursday March 22<sup>nd</sup>, an investigator from the Medical Board of California walked into my husband and my colon hydrotherapy office, Every Body Cleansing Studio, and aggressively threatened and intimidated us into signing a cease and desist affidavit on the spot.  His threat was immediate felony charges for practicing medicine without a license, and up to 28 years in jail. </p>
<p>The investigator backed up his claim with a copy of a “law” that turned out to be the 2002 California Attorney General’s opinion on colon hydrotherapy, which all California colon therapists believed was overturned 2 months later with the passing of Senate Bill-577. (I have been in compliance with SB-577 since its inception.) He didn’t give us time to read the paperwork and he refused us legal counsel. Under extreme duress (I was crying so hard I could barely breathe or hold my pen) we signed.</p>
<p>On his way out of our office he said, “I am fully aware that there are several other therapists in your area, and many more in California – you’re just first. “</p>
<p>Now the history behind this, in Cliff Notes version, is that the Medical Board of California has tried to do this before. I think it was about 12 years ago that they tried to end colon therapy in California. In July of 2002 the Attorney General released an opinion that said that the state of California has decided that colon hydrotherapy is a medical procedure. Two months later, in September of 2002, there was a Senate Bill passed (SB-577) supposedly amending that decision.  Out of SB-577 came a set of guidelines, called the State of California Guidelines (as part of the state’s Business and Professions Code), which allows complementary and alternative health care practitioners the right to market and practice in their businesses as long as they follow the guidelines. Since that time we have had a copy of these guidelines signed by each client and in each client’s file. We have been in compliance. This Medical Board investigator basically said they (the medical board) don’t care about SB-577.  They obviously also don't care about your 9th Amendment Right to self-treat.</p>
<p>(Note: when things quieted down in California, a decade’s long battle was started in Texas between the Medical Board of Texas and the colon therapists of that state. There have also been issues in Louisiana, Washington State, New York and several other states from time to time.)</p>
<p><strong>THE BIGGER PICTURE:</strong></p>
<p>So what does all this mean? In the broader picture I hate to speculate. The first lawyer we spoke to was actually referred to us by our certification board. He told us that it looks like the Medical Board is using us as a test case. They might wait to see if we go down easy – and if so attempt to restart their witch hunt on colon therapists and other alternative health care practitioners in California. He also pointed out that other states will be watching to see what California gets away with. His advice was to either A) go back to work and get arrested on purpose so we can fight this in court, or B) take the offensive and sue the state.  Neither of those options were appealing to us. </p>
<p>At this point, many weeks after our visit from the medical board, there has been one other situation down in Whittier, CA, where the medical board attempted to stop a new practitioner from opening her office. Although that situation clearly has a very different set of circumstances, it had an eerily similar script coming from the Medical Board investigator who contacted her. “Unless you are an MD, or an RN working for an MD, colon hydrotherapy is a felony charge of practicing medicine without a license. We don’t care about SB-577.”</p>
<p>My husband and I have spoken to at least 8 different lawyers. The meetings have all been the same. They say, “Wow… that is terrible. I am so sorry that happened to you. But this is not my area of law. Good luck.”</p>
<p>But there is one other thing each of these meetings has had in common: every lawyer we talked to told us that it was of the utmost importance that we get our cease and desist reversed. They all said that if we didn’t overturn the action taken upon us by the Medical Board of California that the state would use this case to set a new precedent and would probably go after other colon therapists, just as the investigator hinted at. They also said that it could and would be used against other complimentary and alternative health care practices, and that other states would be watching.</p>
<p>At first we thought there was no way we had it in us to be the face of this fight. We spent a couple weeks obsessing over ways we could go back to work without a fight. Many, many times we discussed just walking away from the work and the clients that we both love.</p>
<p>Then, in mid-April we found someone to help us that has a successful track record of winning similarly themed cases. He has a plan, and we are already putting it in motion. For the first time we have hope.</p>
<p>Already the research being done on our behalf has uncovered some interesting information. Although SB-577 may not be the legal safety net complimentary and alternative health care practitioners, especially colon hydrotherapists, have all been lead to believe it is, we are seeing other defenses and areas of the law that can and will be challenged if we have the funds to move forward.</p>
<p>If we win this, the Medical Board of California will have to tuck its tail and slink back under the rock from which t came. Please understand that we not only do this for ourselves, but for ALL California colon therapists – and really for ALL COLON THERAPISTS AND COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONERS NATIONWIDE.</p>
<p><strong><br/>WAYS YOU CAN HELP.</strong></p>
<p>This situation will take some time before we even begin to see where things land. We have no income right now - neither of us are allowed to practice (even though I can name 20 other colon therapists in a 60 mile radius). We have started looking for a part time jobs. We need financial support if we're going tobe able to win this fight.   Your donations can help us actually see this situation through.</p>
<p>We need the following if we all are going to win this battle: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>FINANCIAL SUPPORT:<br/></strong>Making a donation here to our cause would be very appreciated. <br/><br/>We have no idea how long this case will go on. It could be months and it could be years. We have excellent legal assistance committed to seeing this situation through. We are not being charged by the hour, rather he is willing to take what we can fundraise during the duration of this case. We feel incredibly fortunate that such a man is working with us, and we don’t want his generosity of spirit to allow us to become lazy about fundraising. We have no idea how long this case will go on. It could be months and it could be years. <br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>NETWORKING SUPPORT: <br/></strong>Please feel free to post our story and the link to this page to your friends, clubs, email lists, twitter, facebook, etc. We need as much assistance as we can get.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<strong>ACTIVE SUPPORT FOR TESTIMONIES IN COURT:<br/></strong>We are beginning to collect a list of colon hydrotherapists AND colon hydrotherapy clients who are willing to join in the suit against the Medical Board to help ensure the future of Colon Hydrotherapy. <br/><br/>Please message me with your email if you are interested in being on this list. I don’t have any date or details at this point. <br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>IF NOT ACTIVE SUPPORT THEN WE NEED SIGNED AND NOTARIZED AFFIDAVITS FOR WHAT SHALL BECOME A COURT BATTLE.<br/></strong>We are writing a generic affidavit that we will send out to you by email. <br/><br/>Please message me with your email if you are interested in being on this list. We need BOTH colon hydrotherapists AND colon hydrotherapy clients who are willing to sign, have notarized, and mail back an affidavit that will attest that colon hydrotherapy does no harm. We need as many affidavits as possible and from all states.</li>
</ul><p>This is a numbers game, the more people we have involved, the greater our chances of success.</p>
<p>If you believe in what we’re doing, and you see how this will benefit all alternative health care practitioners, not only in California but everywhere, and how that in turn benefits you, please consider helping. </p>
<p>It is not easy for us to ask for financial help, believe me. (We actually find it rather mortifying.) â€¨But we would really appreciate donations to our cause.</p>

After several conversations with people in our industry, I realize there have been  many misconceptions and false beliefs about our situation. Realizing this has been both upsetting and eye-opening for me. It has shown me that even though I have tried to carefully explain the circumstances of our situation, people have a difficult time seeing beyond their own experiences and the assumptions they have formed because of those experiences. 

So, to be incredibly clear I want to cut to the chase and spell a few things out. 
THE MEDICAL BOARD INVESTIGATOR NEVER MENTIONED, NOR DID HIS VISIT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH : 

Our website
Our advertising
The class of our device
Whether we had a prescription for our equipment
Whether we had a prescription for our supplies
Whether our clients had a prescription for our service
The situation in Texas or any other state

 WHAT HE DID SAY WAS: 

The state of California decided in July of 2002 that Colon Hydrotherapy is a medical procedure. 
The ONLY WAY someone can practice colon hydrotherapy in the state of California is to be an MD, ND or a surgeon, or be an RN working for (in a business owned at least 51% by) an MD, ND or a surgeon. 
That SB-577 did not cover us. In fact, we were told that the medical board doesn’t care about SB-577. 
That he was fully aware that there are several other therapists in our area, and many more in California, and that we were just first. 

 

MORE DETAILED VERSION:â€¨On Thursday March 22nd, an investigator from the Medical Board of California walked into my husband and my colon hydrotherapy office, Every Body Cleansing Studio, and aggressively threatened and intimidated us into signing a cease and desist affidavit on the spot.  His threat was immediate felony charges for practicing medicine without a license, and up to 28 years in jail. 
The investigator backed up his claim with a copy of a “law” that turned out to be the 2002 California Attorney General’s opinion on colon hydrotherapy, which all California colon therapists believed was overturned 2 months later with the passing of Senate Bill-577. (I have been in compliance with SB-577 since its inception.) He didn’t give us time to read the paperwork and he refused us legal counsel. Under extreme duress (I was crying so hard I could barely breathe or hold my pen) we signed.
On his way out of our office he said, “I am fully aware that there are several other therapists in your area, and many more in California – you’re just first. “
Now the history behind this, in Cliff Notes version, is that the Medical Board of California has tried to do this before. I think it was about 12 years ago that they tried to end colon therapy in California. In July of 2002 the Attorney General released an opinion that said that the state of California has decided that colon hydrotherapy is a medical procedure. Two months later, in September of 2002, there was a Senate Bill passed (SB-577) supposedly amending that decision.  Out of SB-577 came a set of guidelines, called the State of California Guidelines (as part of the state’s Business and Professions Code), which allows complementary and alternative health care practitioners the right to market and practice in their businesses as long as they follow the guidelines. Since that time we have had a copy of these guidelines signed by each client and in each client’s file. We have been in compliance. This Medical Board investigator basically said they (the medical board) don’t care about SB-577.  They obviously also don't care about your 9th Amendment Right to self-treat.
(Note: when things quieted down in California, a decade’s long battle was started in Texas between the Medical Board of Texas and the colon therapists of that state. There have also been issues in Louisiana, Washington State, New York and several other states from time to time.)
THE BIGGER PICTURE:
So what does all this mean? In the broader picture I hate to speculate. The first lawyer we spoke to was actually referred to us by our certification board. He told us that it looks like the Medical Board is using us as a test case. They might wait to see if we go down easy – and if so attempt to restart their witch hunt on colon therapists and other alternative health care practitioners in California. He also pointed out that other states will be watching to see what California gets away with. His advice was to either A) go back to work and get arrested on purpose so we can fight this in court, or B) take the offensive and sue the state.  Neither of those options were appealing to us. 
At this point, many weeks after our visit from the medical board, there has been one other situation down in Whittier, CA, where the medical board attempted to stop a new practitioner from opening her office. Although that situation clearly has a very different set of circumstances, it had an eerily similar script coming from the Medical Board investigator who contacted her. “Unless you are an MD, or an RN working for an MD, colon hydrotherapy is a felony charge of practicing medicine without a license. We don’t care about SB-577.”
My husband and I have spoken to at least 8 different lawyers. The meetings have all been the same. They say, “Wow… that is terrible. I am so sorry that happened to you. But this is not my area of law. Good luck.”
But there is one other thing each of these meetings has had in common: every lawyer we talked to told us that it was of the utmost importance that we get our cease and desist reversed. They all said that if we didn’t overturn the action taken upon us by the Medical Board of California that the state would use this case to set a new precedent and would probably go after other colon therapists, just as the investigator hinted at. They also said that it could and would be used against other complimentary and alternative health care practices, and that other states would be watching.
At first we thought there was no way we had it in us to be the face of this fight. We spent a couple weeks obsessing over ways we could go back to work without a fight. Many, many times we discussed just walking away from the work and the clients that we both love.
Then, in mid-April we found someone to help us that has a successful track record of winning similarly themed cases. He has a plan, and we are already putting it in motion. For the first time we have hope.
Already the research being done on our behalf has uncovered some interesting information. Although SB-577 may not be the legal safety net complimentary and alternative health care practitioners, especially colon hydrotherapists, have all been lead to believe it is, we are seeing other defenses and areas of the law that can and will be challenged if we have the funds to move forward.
If we win this, the Medical Board of California will have to tuck its tail and slink back under the rock from which t came. Please understand that we not only do this for ourselves, but for ALL California colon therapists – and really for ALL COLON THERAPISTS AND COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONERS NATIONWIDE.
WAYS YOU CAN HELP.
This situation will take some time before we even begin to see where things land. We have no income right now - neither of us are allowed to practice (even though I can name 20 other colon therapists in a 60 mile radius). We have started looking for a part time jobs. We need financial support if we're going tobe able to win this fight.   Your donations can help us actually see this situation through.
We need the following if we all are going to win this battle: 


FINANCIAL SUPPORT:Making a donation here to our cause would be very appreciated. We have no idea how long this case will go on. It could be months and it could be years. We have excellent legal assistance committed to seeing this situation through. We are not being charged by the hour, rather he is willing to take what we can fundraise during the duration of this case. We feel incredibly fortunate that such a man is working with us, and we don’t want his generosity of spirit to allow us to become lazy about fundraising. We have no idea how long this case will go on. It could be months and it could be years.  

NETWORKING SUPPORT: Please feel free to post our story and the link to this page to your friends, clubs, email lists, twitter, facebook, etc. We need as much assistance as we can get.


ACTIVE SUPPORT FOR TESTIMONIES IN COURT:We are beginning to collect a list of colon hydrotherapists AND colon hydrotherapy clients who are willing to join in the suit against the Medical Board to help ensure the future of Colon Hydrotherapy. Please message me with your email if you are interested in being on this list. I don’t have any date or details at this point. 


IF NOT ACTIVE SUPPORT THEN WE NEED SIGNED AND NOTARIZED AFFIDAVITS FOR WHAT SHALL BECOME A COURT BATTLE.We are writing a generic affidavit that we will send out to you by email. Please message me with your email if you are interested in being on this list. We need BOTH colon hydrotherapists AND colon hydrotherapy clients who are willing to sign, have notarized, and mail back an affidavit that will attest that colon hydrotherapy does no harm. We need as many affidavits as possible and from all states.
This is a numbers game, the more people we have involved, the greater our chances of success.
If you believe in what we’re doing, and you see how this will benefit all alternative health care practitioners, not only in California but everywhere, and how that in turn benefits you, please consider helping. 
It is not easy for us to ask for financial help, believe me. (We actually find it rather mortifying.) â€¨But we would really appreciate donations to our cause.
Thank you so much,Shea Lynn Baird & Stephen J. Barlow

<p>I’m Kasia and I am a secondary school teacher
from London. In January 2015 I am about to start My Healing Journey. A journey across
north of Spain to the shrine of the apostle St. James the Great in the

to help me pay for the equipment and cover the expenses during the pilgrimage. </p>
<p><b>Why?</b></p>
<p>Two years ago I lost my mum and my life changed. Everyday chores and work have helped me to get through the most difficult time. Now I feel I need
some time for myself. I need time to reflect on what has happened and where to
go from here. I’m embarking on this spiritual journey to find the strength
and confidence to direct my life where I want it to be. <br/></p>
<p><b>Where
am I going?</b></p>

network of ancient pilgrim routes stretching across Europe and coming together
at the tomb of St. James (Santiago in Spanish) in Santiago de Compostela in
north-west Spain. <em><span>I will walk the so-called “French way,”

will start my </span></em>almost 800 km long pilgrimage in
Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port (“St. John at the Foot of the Pass”) on the French side
of both the mountains and the border. The route passes through Pamplona, Puente

it reaches the “City of the Apostle” in the western reaches of Galicia. It
takes, on average, 4 – 6 weeks to walk. The route is extremely well-waymarked throughout but in winter it is
likely to snow in the Pyrenees, the Montes de Oca (before Burgos) and parts of
the Montes de León and Galicia or rain heavily in Navarre.</p>
<p><b>What

<p>As with any adventure there are some risks involved in my

the aim is for me to walk to Santiago de Compostela on my own. The second

<p>My goal is to collect

<p>It contains reception sensors, microfonsand vibros as
actuators, that influence gently to definite head points. This product version has
no radiation sensors, which makes the device’s active influence on the brain
minimal and does not affect its functionality. Below you will find short function description together with possibilities.<br/></p>
<p><b>Snoring prevention.</b></p>
<p><i>Let yourself and those
you love get enough sleep.</i></p>
<p>Snoring can be a trial for both the sleeping
and the people around. Snoring prevention wakes you up gently once you start to
snore.</p>
<p><b>Nightmares and uneasy
dreams’ prevention.</b></p>
<p><i>Positive dreams are a
key to positive mood throughout the day.</i></p>
<p>Suffering from nightmares or uneasy dreams?
Getting too anxious about them? The Nightmares’ protection feature wakes you up
even before a bad dream conceives – and you’re not going to see it!</p>
<p><b>Alarm</b></p>
<p>It Wakes you gently in optimal moment<span> of dream phase.</span></p>
<p>How often do you feel challenged to get up in
the morning, when an alarm clock rings? It means that the alarm wakes you up at
the most inappropriate time, during one of the heavy sleep phases, when waking
up is difficult. Forget about it! The sensor identifies the most suitable
moment when getting up is easy for you, and the vibromechanisms wake you up
exactly when you need to. Mornings have never been as easy and pleasant!:)</p>
<p><b>Dream memorizing
activation</b></p>
<p>See as many bright and various dreams as
possible.</p>
<p>We all see dreams; however, few of us can remember
exactly what we saw in a dream. Why does it happen? The thing is, we only memorize
dreams when waking up during the shortwave sleep phase happening every 90
minutes at the beginning of sleep with increased frequency in the morning. It’s
also referred to as a REM (Rapid Eye Movement) phase. Sensors identify when
this phase starts, while vibromechanisms control sleep deepness and wake you up
gently at the end of a dream plot. As a result, you are sure to remember your
dreams in all details.</p>
<p><b>Dream recording</b></p>
<p>Like a dream? We’ll record it for you.</p>
<p>One of the most innovative features of the system. As
we know, the dreams we memorize arise during the REM phases, when
electroencephalogram shows fluttering electrical activities similar to
saw-toothed <a href=""https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%91%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B0-%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BC"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">beta
waves</a>. That’s the period when electric activity of your brain is similar to
the one of vigilance, and that’s the time when you see dreams you can memorize
and then reproduce. Researches have shown that recording brain’s electric
activity during this period of time and “reproducing” these during a similar
REM phase in a specific way enables you to see the dream you saw before. The
most difficult aspect is to separate dream plots between each other without any
mistakes in order to record specific plots, not the whole REM phase. We are
currently working on it and are going to complete the job by the time the
device is launched.</p>

<br/><p><b>Wave rhythms (log)</b></p>
<p><i>The whole brain in
plain sight</i></p>
<p>Are you interested to know how well you sleep and when
do sleep phase switch between each other? Wave rhythms’ recording is just the
right way for you. Once you wake up and grab you smartphone or a tablet, you’ll
have all the details about the way you sleep: when did you feel asleep, how
deep was it, when did rapid eye movement phase begin, for how long did it last,
etc. You can log this info in your smartphone on a daily basis to review and to
analyze it.</p>
<p><b>Massage (relaxation)</b></p>
<p><i>Get relaxed</i></p>
<p>Get your head massaged based on one of the massage
programs using vibromechanisms to improve blood circulation, get relaxed before
going to sleep and get rid of headaches, if necessary.</p>
<p><b>Meditative music</b></p>
<p><i>For those who can’t sleep in
silence.</i></p>
<p>An additional feature – so far we are not sure whether
it makes sense to add it up; after all, you can use a player for music.</p>
<p>However, this option is possible and easy to
implement.</p>

<br/><p></p>
<h3>Dream Catcher Pro edition–
full wave control.</h3>
<p>This version enshrines all the innovative features
we’ve been working on for quite a while. Unlike Dream Catcher Light Edition, it
contains radiation elements, and the device functionality is much richer.
Dream Catcher Pro Edition are complemented by the following features:</p>
<p><b>Falling asleep
generator.</b></p>
<p><i>Falling asleep made
easy.</i></p>
<p>When you’re excited with thousands of different
ideas in your head, it can be so challenging to fall asleep. That’s when your
brain is too busy, you won’t fall asleep unless you calm its rhythms down.
Listening to meditative music or counting sheep helps sometimes, however, these
are not always suitable options. Radiation elements influence your brain with
alpha rhythms – these are natural for your brain and come prior to deep sleep
process. Thus, you begin to nod and then finally fall asleep. Forget about
listening to quite music, tossing and turning or counting sheep.</p>
<p><b>Stop Insomnia</b></p>
<p><i>Say ‘goodbye’ to
insomnia!</i><br/></p>
<p>Forget about all your troubles related to
insomnia. Now you simply need to go to bed, close your eyes and turn this
feature on. Your brain starts moving towards a calmer beta-rhytm, you begin to
nod at the alpha rhythm, which then results into deep sleep. Throw all you
sleeping pills away. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Bright dreams</b></p>
<i>Let us paint your
dreams<br/><br/></i>
<p>When waking up, few of us can recall the dreams
we had last night, and even those of us who do forget their dreams within
several hours. Occasionally, some of our dreams are so bright and clear that we
can retell them in details even after a long period of time. “Bright dreams”
feature is there to help you remember any of your dreams in color – you’re sure
to recall what you saw even in several weeks. Make the world of dreams even
closer to reality, try it out and give us your feedback.</p>
<p><b>Dream management</b></p>
<p><i>Realize your dream</i></p>
<p>Yes, that’s the conscious dream management
you’ve probably read about on the Internet. To cut a long story short, whenever
you see a dream, you start receiving some external signals, e.g., an LED begins
to blink. You’re able to see this blink half-asleep and realize that what you
see is just a dream. In theory, you are then able to manage it. The
technologies used before are very rough, even though after a series of special
trainings they led to similar effects. In this case no trainings are required:
simply activate this feature, and Dream Catcher will let you know once you start
seeing a dream.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Deep sleep (sleeping
one’s fill)</b></p>
<p><i>Why don’t you simply get
enough of sleep?</i></p>
<p>Have gone to bed too late and need to get up
early? Most likely you’ll find it challenging to get up and will feel fouled-up
and sleepy throughout the day. However, there’s now a solution to it, too.
Activate the “deep sleep” feature on your smartphone, set the time to get up,
and Dream Catcher will do the rest: it will make you fall asleep, get into deep
sleep and minimize superficial sleep phases, depending on the remaining time
before waking up. You won’t see any dreams, but at least you’re guaranteed to
wake up feeling alive and upbeat. Canonlyhavearound 3-5 hoursofsleep? Itdoesn’tmatteranylonger. You simply need to go to sleep, while
Dream Catcher will do the rest!</p>
<p><b>Dream stimulation (playback)</b></p>
<p><i>Play your dreams back</i></p>
<p>One of the most innovative features. You are
now able to both “record” your dreams and to play them back. When you are in
REM phase, Dream Catcher will stimulate your brain gently based on the frequency
and sequence of the waves recorded. As a result, you will be able to see the
dream you have already recorded. You’re not going to see a 100% copy, however,
the general plot remains the same. Take your chance of going through the dream
you’ve already seen.</p>
<p><b>Alarm clock</b></p>
<p><i>The best morning ever!)</i></p>
<p>Forget about music, vibrations, ringing and
other noises or vibrating effects! All you need to do is to set the time of
waking up on your smartphone, and Dream Catcher will do the rest. By the time
you need to get up, it will move you from deep sleep to superficial sleep, and
you will awake on your own – just at the time you’ve set on your alarm clock.
You will wake up just in the right phase, and your sleep won’t be interrupted
from the outside. You get awaken on your own only when you’ve had enough sleep,
and from now on you can set the time to do it. Looks like the most sparing way
to wake anyone up!</p>
<p><b>Choosing the scene</b></p>
<p><i>Choose the dream you
want to see.</i></p>
<p>One of the most amazing things about
Dream Catcher is that it enables you to choose the basis or the scene for your
dream. How does it actually work? For example, you want to go back to the times
when you were a kid, and need to recall the feeling of flying in your dreams;
have a walk around a green lawn; or to meet a friend of yours. Choose any scene
from the set, fall asleep and… enjoy the basis you’ve ordered. This feature is
in beta-test at the moment, and, even though we’re still working on it, 70% of
those testing the solution see exactly the scenes they have ordered. The number
of bases is not impressive, but, as we’re moving forward with the project,
we’ll be adding up new versions. Anyway, it’s worth trying, isn’t it?</p>

<br/>
<p>That’s a short list of the features and
capabilities you can take advantage of using our device. We are still working
on it, testing new options and complement the system with the successful ones. The
potential of active dream management is unbelievable, and we’re just at the
beginning of our journey.</p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
</div>
<p>Giulio Tononi, a professor of psychiatry
at the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health,
has discovered how to stimulate brain waves that characterize the deepest stage
of sleep. <br/></p>
<p>During slow wave activity, which
occupies about 80 percent of sleeping hours, waves of electrical activity wash
across the brain, roughly once a second, 1,000 times a night. In a new paper
being published in the scientific journal PNAS, Tononi and colleagues,
including Marcello Massimini, also of the UW-Madison School of Medicine and
Public Health, described the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to
initiate slow waves in sleeping volunteers. The researchers recorded brain
electrical activity with an electroencephalograph (EEG).</p>
<p>A TMS instrument sends a harmless
magnetic signal through the scalp and skull and into the brain, where it
activates electrical impulses. In response to each burst of magnetism, the
subjects' brains immediately produced slow waves typical of deep sleep, Tononi
says. ""With a single pulse, we were able to induce a wave that looks
identical to the waves the brain makes normally during sleep.""</p>
<p>The researchers have learned to locate
the TMS device above a specific part of the brain, where it causes slow waves
that travel throughout the brain. ""We don't know why, but this is a very good
place to evoke big waves that clearly travel through every part of the
brain,"" Tononi says.</p>
<p>The following steps
were pretty obvious. If we manage to induce a wave similar to the waves
produced by our brain during the process of sleeping, then we can create
various visual patterns and influence the set of dreams thanks to stimulating different
brain sections. </p>

<p>We continue working
on the development of the product, we know where to move and what to improve. But
in our opinion, we’ve completed the most important task – we’ve created an
opportunity. An opportunity to see the dreams we are interested in. The form, the

are secondary and are steadily made better and even perfect later on. The key point
is in the idea we implement.</p><h3>A little bit about</h3><p></p><p>We are an international team of enthusiastic people from Great Britain, Czech Republic, Ukraine and USA. We are keen on studying problems of human underconsciousness as well as dreams. Our team includes neurophysiologists, designers, programmers, and psychologists who are bright people producing and implementing ideas.

etc. You can log this info in your smartphone on a daily basis to review and to
analyze it.
Massage (relaxation)
Get relaxed
Get your head massaged based on one of the massage
programs using vibromechanisms to improve blood circulation, get relaxed before
going to sleep and get rid of headaches, if necessary.
Meditative music
For those who can’t sleep in
silence.
An additional feature – so far we are not sure whether
it makes sense to add it up; after all, you can use a player for music.
However, this option is possible and easy to
implement.





Dream Catcher Pro edition–
full wave control.
This version enshrines all the innovative features
we’ve been working on for quite a while. Unlike Dream Catcher Light Edition, it
contains radiation elements, and the device functionality is much richer.
Dream Catcher Pro Edition are complemented by the following features:
Falling asleep
generator.
Falling asleep made
easy.
When you’re excited with thousands of different
ideas in your head, it can be so challenging to fall asleep. That’s when your
brain is too busy, you won’t fall asleep unless you calm its rhythms down.
Listening to meditative music or counting sheep helps sometimes, however, these
are not always suitable options. Radiation elements influence your brain with
alpha rhythms – these are natural for your brain and come prior to deep sleep
process. Thus, you begin to nod and then finally fall asleep. Forget about
listening to quite music, tossing and turning or counting sheep.
Stop Insomnia
Say ‘goodbye’ to
insomnia!
Forget about all your troubles related to
insomnia. Now you simply need to go to bed, close your eyes and turn this
feature on. Your brain starts moving towards a calmer beta-rhytm, you begin to
nod at the alpha rhythm, which then results into deep sleep. Throw all you
sleeping pills away. 

Bright dreams
Let us paint your
dreams
When waking up, few of us can recall the dreams
we had last night, and even those of us who do forget their dreams within
several hours. Occasionally, some of our dreams are so bright and clear that we
can retell them in details even after a long period of time. “Bright dreams”
feature is there to help you remember any of your dreams in color – you’re sure
to recall what you saw even in several weeks. Make the world of dreams even
closer to reality, try it out and give us your feedback.
Dream management
Realize your dream
Yes, that’s the conscious dream management
you’ve probably read about on the Internet. To cut a long story short, whenever
you see a dream, you start receiving some external signals, e.g., an LED begins
to blink. You’re able to see this blink half-asleep and realize that what you
see is just a dream. In theory, you are then able to manage it. The
technologies used before are very rough, even though after a series of special
trainings they led to similar effects. In this case no trainings are required:
simply activate this feature, and Dream Catcher will let you know once you start
seeing a dream.

Deep sleep (sleeping
one’s fill)
Why don’t you simply get
enough of sleep?
Have gone to bed too late and need to get up
early? Most likely you’ll find it challenging to get up and will feel fouled-up
and sleepy throughout the day. However, there’s now a solution to it, too.
Activate the “deep sleep” feature on your smartphone, set the time to get up,
and Dream Catcher will do the rest: it will make you fall asleep, get into deep
sleep and minimize superficial sleep phases, depending on the remaining time
before waking up. You won’t see any dreams, but at least you’re guaranteed to
wake up feeling alive and upbeat. Canonlyhavearound 3-5 hoursofsleep? Itdoesn’tmatteranylonger. You simply need to go to sleep, while
Dream Catcher will do the rest!
Dream stimulation (playback)
Play your dreams back
One of the most innovative features. You are
now able to both “record” your dreams and to play them back. When you are in
REM phase, Dream Catcher will stimulate your brain gently based on the frequency
and sequence of the waves recorded. As a result, you will be able to see the
dream you have already recorded. You’re not going to see a 100% copy, however,
the general plot remains the same. Take your chance of going through the dream
you’ve already seen.
Alarm clock
The best morning ever!)
Forget about music, vibrations, ringing and
other noises or vibrating effects! All you need to do is to set the time of
waking up on your smartphone, and Dream Catcher will do the rest. By the time
you need to get up, it will move you from deep sleep to superficial sleep, and
you will awake on your own – just at the time you’ve set on your alarm clock.
You will wake up just in the right phase, and your sleep won’t be interrupted
from the outside. You get awaken on your own only when you’ve had enough sleep,
and from now on you can set the time to do it. Looks like the most sparing way
to wake anyone up!
Choosing the scene
Choose the dream you
want to see.
One of the most amazing things about
Dream Catcher is that it enables you to choose the basis or the scene for your
dream. How does it actually work? For example, you want to go back to the times
when you were a kid, and need to recall the feeling of flying in your dreams;
have a walk around a green lawn; or to meet a friend of yours. Choose any scene
from the set, fall asleep and… enjoy the basis you’ve ordered. This feature is
in beta-test at the moment, and, even though we’re still working on it, 70% of
those testing the solution see exactly the scenes they have ordered. The number
of bases is not impressive, but, as we’re moving forward with the project,
we’ll be adding up new versions. Anyway, it’s worth trying, isn’t it?



That’s a short list of the features and
capabilities you can take advantage of using our device. We are still working
on it, testing new options and complement the system with the successful ones. The
potential of active dream management is unbelievable, and we’re just at the
beginning of our journey.
How it works

Giulio Tononi, a professor of psychiatry
at the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health,
has discovered how to stimulate brain waves that characterize the deepest stage
of sleep. 
During slow wave activity, which
occupies about 80 percent of sleeping hours, waves of electrical activity wash
across the brain, roughly once a second, 1,000 times a night. In a new paper
being published in the scientific journal PNAS, Tononi and colleagues,
including Marcello Massimini, also of the UW-Madison School of Medicine and
Public Health, described the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to
initiate slow waves in sleeping volunteers. The researchers recorded brain
electrical activity with an electroencephalograph (EEG).
A TMS instrument sends a harmless
magnetic signal through the scalp and skull and into the brain, where it
activates electrical impulses. In response to each burst of magnetism, the
subjects' brains immediately produced slow waves typical of deep sleep, Tononi
says. ""With a single pulse, we were able to induce a wave that looks
identical to the waves the brain makes normally during sleep.""
The researchers have learned to locate
the TMS device above a specific part of the brain, where it causes slow waves
that travel throughout the brain. ""We don't know why, but this is a very good
place to evoke big waves that clearly travel through every part of the
brain,"" Tononi says.
The following steps
were pretty obvious. If we manage to induce a wave similar to the waves
produced by our brain during the process of sleeping, then we can create
various visual patterns and influence the set of dreams thanks to stimulating different
brain sections. 
In reality Dream
Catcher is a new generation mind machine. We refused from eye-bands, loud alarm
clocks, LED and other elements, used by various developers for taking control
over dreams before. Our product combines a set of sensors, reading
electromagnetic  brain vibrations in its certain
sections, TMS emitters, regulating and changing both the dream outline and the
condition of brain activity, and a controller for accumulating and processing
the information.
All in all, the
device consists of 3 parts:
1. Headband, with reception
sensors and emitting elements
2. A controller for
processing the received signals
3. A program for mobile
phones or a tablet for visualization and managing the controller. 
The three
components provide an unbelievable functionality of the system, a more complete
description of it you can find in ""Functionality"" section.
We continue working
on the development of the product, we know where to move and what to improve. But
in our opinion, we’ve completed the most important task – we’ve created an
opportunity. An opportunity to see the dreams we are interested in. The form, the
design of Dream Сatcher, its additional functions... all the features
are secondary and are steadily made better and even perfect later on. The key point
is in the idea we implement.A little bit aboutWe are an international team of enthusiastic people from Great Britain, Czech Republic, Ukraine and USA. We are keen on studying problems of human underconsciousness as well as dreams. Our team includes neurophysiologists, designers, programmers, and psychologists who are bright people producing and implementing ideas. We have been studying dreams and related processes for more than 12 years and we have been working together for more than 5 years. We focus on studying insomnia questions, working with lucid dreams, and managing sleep rhythms. Our first devices were fixed and connected to personal computer. By use of their sensors we read cerebral rhythms and studied sleep phases. Since then long time has passed. We have gained much experience; have worked out real mind-machine prototype equipment and devices that allow inducing lucid dreams and affecting wave rhythms of brain. All the devices got some defective features, sometimes even substantial. At last we have entered final straight. Dream Сatcher is a new-generation device. It is harmless and small as well as easy-to-use. Moreover it is designed to cause no inconvenience during sleep. Headband is made of soft fabric that wraps one’s head ideally.  The job has not completed yet. We have been carrying on testing period, exploratory studies and experiments aimed at balancing design, size and effectiveness features. We are passionate about our idea and are eager to develop a product that is close to perfection. And we believe that we will achieve our goal with your help.And we need your helpOur goal is to obtain final product that is perfect and functional. To develop such product without your help is very complicated. We have been carrying on this project for three years. At the present moment the first prototype models have been worked out; further development has been conducted, and technologies have been polished up. There is still much work to do. We have to continue conducting research and experiments as well as to purchase component parts and to start up mass production. We are ready to work this way with you support. We would like to see that you are interested in this project and everything we do. We would like to know that you are ready to participate in further development of the project. We would like to underline that we work not for our, but for your benefit as a matter of priority. That is why we highly appreciate your vote as well as your participation in the given project. We would like to express our gratitude for your support. We will do our best to justify it.Media:Fancy Material",13.0,0,"1 Campaign

I grew up in NJ.   I discovered a way to ""reverse"", ""end"", ""stop"" this disease characterized as ""Type 2 Diabetes"" ""customized"" all by a patients own urine &amp; saliva.   Utilizing forensic science, I want to teach my proven proprietary scientific mathematical method that has already proven to help thousands, with NO side effects.  If you are reading this, you  probably know of the millions of diabetics, and pre-diabetics in the world and how it Kills and cost Billions of Dollars!  We hear it every where!  Even the co-morbidities:  Hypertension, High LDL, Dialysis, Cardiovascular conditions, eliminating toes and other body parts, etc.</li>

<ul><li>IMPORTANT LINKS, VIDEOS, PATIENT TESTIMONIES NOTED BELOW.</li></ul>
<div><br/></div>
<ul><li>AWARDS:   I just received the 'Higher Achievement Award' from the Naturopathic Medical Association, 2014; and the  International Academy of Biological Dentistry and Medicine, 2014 Speaker Award.</li></ul>
<ul><li>2014:  I am currently a TEACHER at the  ADULT SCHOOL in Morris County NJ and Somerset County NJ</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>BACKGROUND/GOAL:   This campaign will help raise money to form &amp; START a 501c non-profit organization. Paper work/formation will cost approx. up to $15k to process and file all paper work for a non-profit, utilizing attorneys &amp; accountants.   With all the overheard, expenses &amp; already treating some patients who can't afford it, I am unable to continue without some help.  My building was greatly impacted by HURRICANE SANDY.  I am STILL WAITING for insurance to get settled.  My current business was family owned, lost elderly parents who assisted greatly.  I am financially challenged now, trying catch up, after a domino affect from damaged roof, property &amp; water damage in the building where I see patients and perform testing, etc.  I could provide proof of all to donors who want to schedule to meet.(Or I could just send pics via email).  The 'Take 2 For Type 2, would occupy a space in this building, along with treatment.</li>
</ul>
<div><br/></div>
<ul><li>MY BACKGROUND: At 20, hit by a car, in a coma for 2 weeks. Had a TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury).  When I awoke, I had no idea where I was &amp; what happened to me. I will spare you all of my emotional details, but I will tell you that when the doctors &amp; nurses gave me meds, I ended up waiting for them to leave the room before spitting those pills out.  I do recall when in group rehab/ therapy, others with TBI getting pills, and they were all 'out of it'.  I did not want to be like ""them"", as they looked like 'zombies'  - just drugged out of their minds!  (I'm not saying meds didn't help some but that image stuck with me).</li></ul>
<div><br/></div>
<ul>
<li>The doctors said I was in phenomenal shape and my history as a Boxer had helped save me!  I did not drink nor smoke.  I was into nutrition prior to the accident, but after, I was even more determined to get myself back.  Let me not fool you… It was a hard &amp; challenging road, but I had supporting  parents as an only child.  8 years in therapy learning to talk &amp; walk again and dealing with the challenges that come with a TBI. I treated myself via nutrition &amp; supplements. NO drugs.  We all need to realize the human body ""IS"" AMAZING TECHNOLOGY!  I have a deep passion to thrive and help others!</li>
</ul>
<div><br/></div>
<ul><li>My parents were Opera singers in NY.  As a little kid I remember going to other Opera singers homes &amp; seeing many over weight people. There was lots of beautiful voices, cooking &amp; eating going on!  Then one by one, sadly, they eventually passed on. I don't remember them getting 'OLD'.   That struck me!</li></ul>
<div><br/></div>
<ul><li>My passion for health, nutrition, and treating myself for a TBI, led me to become a Naturopathic, then an Integrative Medical Doctor. I also have a degree in Biological Dental Medicine.   As you may imagine, it took me longer than most, but I did it and through my passion for helping others &amp; over 25 years in the nutritional field, I discovered a way treat Type 2 Diabetes, customized, for each individual person, based on their own urine and saliva.  This is NOT a '1 size fits all DIET or Disease'.   I can perform special scientific testing and based on the results, tell a person exactly what 'they' need to do, WHY &amp; at what 'time'.  Yes, ALL of that 'matters'.   (This instruction may be  very different for each person).</li></ul>
<div><br/></div>
<ul><li>The specific goals of this non-profit formed, Take 2 For Type 2, will be to:</li></ul>
<div>1.  Educate doctors and their patients on how to treat &amp; end Type 2 Diabetes utilizing this proprietary method.  Also, to educate children in a different way and help bring awareness of nutrition, their bodies, their health, confusion and choices.  Please know there are NO drugs used.  I can actually help reduce and in many cases eliminate medication.  There are other companies right now who are calling on physician offices, telling them why it's important to incorporate a weight management program into their practices, trying to sell them their product lines along with it.  Remember, 1 size does NOT fit all.  We have PLENTY of PROOF!</div>
<div>2.   Validate this proven protocol via 3rd parties &amp; expand existing studies per the NIH (National Institute of Health) guidelines &amp; Publish results.</div>
<div>3.  Help treat those Diabetic patients without insurance who cannot afford to get help.</div>
<div>In order to accomplish the above, hiring staff will be the next step to focus on these tasks that need to get accomplished as soon as possible. We will work diligently to put together  Board of Directors including Medical Doctors who have already seen this method work incredibly.   (It's in process).</div>

Don't let the 'cool technology'  fool you!!  Let's get to the bottom of it now &amp; teach others even cooler technology!</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Our society has seemed to accept the 'side effects' as the 'norm' because we heard all of those crazy commercials over and over again!! We are being 'hypnotized' without even knowing it - made to believe that the side effect of some drugs could be a  'stroke' or even 'death' and now that is ""OK"" as long as Big Pharma told us about it ????!!!! -so  we can STILL take the drug!!!  Are we loosing our minds??!!!  NO WAY - THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE!!  LET'S ALL WAKE UP!!!  Ok.. Maybe not everyone has been in a coma, but I wish I could share an ounce of my passion for life I have since then with you :)</li> </ul>
<p>I don't know what it would take to have your personally donate, but I do know the many reasons listed above are real.  I have over 25 years in the nutrition/ food science field.  Please go to <a href=""http://ehrhardtcenter.com/testimonials.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://ehrhardtcenter.com/testimonials.html</a> to see ONLY SOME of the Hundreds of testimonies I have from my current patients and Medical Doctors.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p> <ul>

(Treats anyone from anywhere in the USA)</li> <li>Describe where the funds go if you don't reach your entire goal:  If we don't reach the goal here, we will continue to ask for funding and put all of the monies raised on here toward paying the fees of forming this non-profit and toward other non-profit .

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <ul>
<li>According to the CDC (Center for Disease Control) <a href=""http://www.CDC.gov"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.CDC.gov</a> 29 Million people have diabetes in the USA alone.  This does not includes the millions of pre-diabetics and those who don't even know they have it.  It cost Billions of dollars every YEAR.  It Kills!

</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <ul>
<li>If for some reason we do not get enough money to pay for the non-profit paper work/start up fees, then we will continue to ask for donations until we do.  We are determined to start this non-profit to help millions.  We must be able to cover our other expenses TO KEEP the testing lab and facility first located at 31 South Finley Avenue, Basking Ridge, NJ, so any left over money after the initial 501C related expenses, will be applied to the expense associated with the testing lab and facility to operate, and toward hiring some of the volunteers.  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Right now, I have some wonderful volunteers who generously donated their time in many ways to help the facility operate; however, I am at risk of loosing some, as they need to get back to paid positions.    They are reliable trustworthy people and I need their help!   IE,  Rosemarie has a Degree in Medical Lab Technology - worked in a hospital laboratory for 8 years (Microbiology and Hematology).  She is also a professional who has a Hospital Medical Lab Sales background with a BS degree; and has nearly a decade of experience in the non-profit sector w/ a total of 20 years in Medical/Hospital Sales.   June, lives very close to the facility.  She is a patient turned volunteer,  a retired Vet, w/ a compassionate heart &amp; carries a great deal of integrity and values.</li> </ul>

IMPORTANT LINKS, VIDEOS, PATIENT TESTIMONIES NOTED BELOW.

AWARDS:   I just received the 'Higher Achievement Award' from the Naturopathic Medical Association, 2014; and the  International Academy of Biological Dentistry and Medicine, 2014 Speaker Award.
2014:  I am currently a TEACHER at the  ADULT SCHOOL in Morris County NJ and Somerset County NJ

BACKGROUND/GOAL:   This campaign will help raise money to form & START a 501c non-profit organization. Paper work/formation will cost approx. up to $15k to process and file all paper work for a non-profit, utilizing attorneys & accountants.   With all the overheard, expenses & already treating some patients who can't afford it, I am unable to continue without some help.  My building was greatly impacted by HURRICANE SANDY.  I am STILL WAITING for insurance to get settled.  My current business was family owned, lost elderly parents who assisted greatly.  I am financially challenged now, trying catch up, after a domino affect from damaged roof, property & water damage in the building where I see patients and perform testing, etc.  I could provide proof of all to donors who want to schedule to meet.(Or I could just send pics via email).  The 'Take 2 For Type 2, would occupy a space in this building, along with treatment.


MY BACKGROUND: At 20, hit by a car, in a coma for 2 weeks. Had a TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury).  When I awoke, I had no idea where I was & what happened to me. I will spare you all of my emotional details, but I will tell you that when the doctors & nurses gave me meds, I ended up waiting for them to leave the room before spitting those pills out.  I do recall when in group rehab/ therapy, others with TBI getting pills, and they were all 'out of it'.  I did not want to be like ""them"", as they looked like 'zombies'  - just drugged out of their minds!  (I'm not saying meds didn't help some but that image stuck with me).


The doctors said I was in phenomenal shape and my history as a Boxer had helped save me!  I did not drink nor smoke.  I was into nutrition prior to the accident, but after, I was even more determined to get myself back.  Let me not fool you… It was a hard & challenging road, but I had supporting  parents as an only child.  8 years in therapy learning to talk & walk again and dealing with the challenges that come with a TBI. I treated myself via nutrition & supplements. NO drugs.  We all need to realize the human body ""IS"" AMAZING TECHNOLOGY!  I have a deep passion to thrive and help others!


My parents were Opera singers in NY.  As a little kid I remember going to other Opera singers homes & seeing many over weight people. There was lots of beautiful voices, cooking & eating going on!  Then one by one, sadly, they eventually passed on. I don't remember them getting 'OLD'.   That struck me!

Two thirds of the roots on my two front teeth were gone. The term, as I found out later, is root resorption. This, of course, was a massive problem.

I am stoked that you are even considering helping me out, and have some delightful perks for you if you do. First, each and every donor will receive a hand written thank you note from myself. Drawings, poems, and songs accompany certain levels. It's a small thing to thank you for what you'll be doing for me. Please rest assured that even if the fundraising goal is not met, every penny of it will be going towards my dental/orthodontic procedure. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and thank you again for considering helping.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Für einen guten Zweck..<br/>
</h3>
<div><br/></div> <p>Es freut mich sehr, dass ihr den Weg hierhin gefunden habt. Ich möchte euch heute von einem tollen Menschen erzählen. Jahrelang war dieses junge Mädchen eine meiner besten Freundinnen. Leider wurde vor ungefähr 2 Jahren eine seltene Form von<a href=""http://www.lungeninformationsdienst.de/krankheiten/weitere-lungenerkrankungen/primaere-ciliaere-dyskinesie-pcd-und-kartagener-syndrom/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Primärer Ciliäre Dyskinesie</a> bei ihr diagnostiziert. Wir haben uns seit einer Ewigkeit nicht gesehen, jedoch ist es an der Zeit, dass diesem Mädchen etwas zurückgegeben wird, was ihr der Alltag genommen hat. Ich möchte hier keine Mitleidsstory verbreiten, deswegen werde ich euch nicht viel darüber erzählen, wie es ihr geht oder wie lange sie noch zu leben hat. Wenn es keinen Grund für diese Kampagne gäbe, dann würde ich sie nicht erstellen. Ich kann euch sagen, dass sie jeden Tag Schleim aus ihrer Lunge herausgepumpt bekommt &amp; das unter Vollnarkose. Ihr alle könnt euch bestimmt vorstellen wie es ihr dabei ergeht.<br/><br/>Was ich mir wünsche..<br/></p> <ul>
<li>Wir können sie nicht heilen, aber wir können ihre Lebenszeit um einiges verschönern..<br/>
</li> <li>Dass wir ihr Dinge finanzieren können, die sie glücklich machen werden, dass sie noch Dinge erlebt die sie jeden Tag lächeln lassen werden<br/>
</li> <li>Wir Zusammenhalt zeigen und uns für die Dinge einsetzen die uns wichtig sind.. unsere Freunde und Mitmenschen.<br/>
</li> </ul>

<p></p>
<h3>An wen das Geld geht</h3>
<p>Sie war jahrelang eine Bilderbuchfreundin der man alles anvertrauen konnte, jemand, den sich jeder Mensch an seiner Seite wünscht. Leider hat die Krankheit sie gezwungen vieles aufzugeben, ihre schulische Ausbildung, das Abitur vorneweg, aber vor allem ihren Lebensstil. Sie ist schon immer eine spontane Person gewesen mit der man Stunden verbringen konnte und jede Minute gelacht hat. Jedoch konnte man genauso gut auch seine Sorgen in ihre Hände fallen lassen und wusste zu jedem Zeitpunkt, dass sie dort mehr als gut und sicher aufgehoben waren. Sie ist ein Mädchen welches jede Hilfe verdient und deswegen wende ich mich an euch, mir heute zu helfen, ihr zu helfen. Das Leben ist kurz &amp; kostbar, wir sollten versuchen jedem ein schönes Leben bieten zu können, gerade jenen, die diese Hilfe brauchen. Wenn sie mich fragt, wie es mir geht und ich sage, dass ich leicht erkältet bin, dann macht sie sich mehr Sorgen um mich, als ich es eigentlich jemals verdient hätte. Sie ist die beste Seele die ich kenne.<br/><br/>In letzter Zeit ist sie leider sehr oft an ihr Bett gebunden und verbringt viel Zeit mit dem Lesen von Büchern, sie verschlingt eines nach dem anderen. Rausgehen kann sie nur an guten Tagen, wenn Kraft sie erfüllt. Bus fahren wäre schon zu anstrengend für sie. Wir sollten ihr helfen, öfters Kraft schöpfen zu können, ihre Tage so genussvoll und schön zu gestalten, wie es nur möglich ist. Dazu werden wir jeden Cent nutzen. <br/></p>

<h3>Why is a pharmacist writing a cookbook?</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539969657/hliw58ppezob8uaocm6z.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>When I was in pharmacy school, I found that food has a very profound impact on our healing and what we put in our bodies will either heal us or make us sicker. In the same way that we use pharmaceuticals to impact our biology, we can use food as our medicine.</p>
<p>I call this concept food pharmacology. Food can be a powerful ally in your healing journey, and it is important to eat the right foods to get the best results.</p>
<p>While I bring the unique perspective of a pharmacist into my writing, I am also a patient who has walked this journey too. My personal story is what led me to write my first two books, <i>Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis: The Root Cause</i> and <i>Hashimoto’s Protocol</i>, and led me to develop my Rootcology supplement line and a host of other Hashimoto’s solutions.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>You asked, I answered</h3>
<p>For a long time, you guys have asked me to create a cookbook with healing food recipes because many of you have tried countless diets without experiencing real improvement or have even gotten sicker. My cookbook is different because it teaches you how to support yourself through digestive enzymes, and proper nutrients.</p>
<p>FOOD PHARMACOLOGY is filled with tools, strategies and over 125 delicious recipes to help refresh your body so that it can begin the healing process. And while most of the recipes are quite simple, there are some fancier ones for those special occasions!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Creating to Empower</h3>
<p>I love creating new material, and I am touched each time someone shares how their life is changed by the tools I share. Maybe this cookbook will help others who are struggling to make sense of their condition find hope and relief from their symptoms.</p>
<p><strong><i>What if your own health breakthrough started with nutrition?</i></strong></p>
<p>I invite you to join the narrative and to take back control of your health. I believe your story is special and I hope you feel empowered with the solutions I provide in my cookbook</p>
</div><div>
<h3>But I need your help</h3>
<p>Here’s a little publishing secret...it’s really expensive to print beautiful, full color books like my cookbook, so the publisher is only agreeing to print a small number of copies at first. Please help me show them that there is a high demand within our community by pre-ordering your copy today.</p>
<p>By doing so enables us to get this out to the masses, making it mainstream for the millions of people who have Hashimoto's, thyroid disease and other autoimmune conditions.</p>
<p>I also want to get it in the hands of doctors and other healthcare professionals to use as a tool in guiding people to wellness.</p>
<p>I need your help to make this happen...</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539969500/ulzybe9q1jmdlij9qjgh.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>What happens if the campaign is a success?</h3>
<p>Then this book gets printed, and we celebrate! The publisher will give the “green light” to print more copies which will help reach thousands of people with autoimmune conditions who need this information to heal.</p>
<p>I wanted to make sure that our campaign backers received amazing prizes, so everyone who supports this mission at the $29 pledge level or above is guaranteed to have a beautiful hardcover copy reserved for them.</p>
<p>Plus, that’s just the beginning. I get to reward you with even more nurturing prizes from our exclusive list. <strong>Click on each perk for a full description and find the one that’s best for you!</strong></p>
<p>My favorite is the No-Brainer because you get four cookbooks! One for you and three for your friends and family - hello holiday shopping solution :) This prize also includes the Root Cause eBook, the digital version of the Thyroid Secret, the Root Cause Reset, bonus recipes and the intro/first chapter from my book.</p>
<h3>If not?</h3>
<p>If we don’t reach our goal then the publisher will only print a limited quantity and the book won't reach the people who need it the most. The wait to get the book could be weeks or months long and the worst part? The book may never be printed in larger quantities which could mean that practitioners and doctors and people just like you and me won’t get this vital information. Please help me and join this mission to show the publisher that we want TONS of copies of this book printed.</p>
<h3>Why Indiegogo?</h3>
<p>Indiegogo gives us a platform to send a clear signal to the publisher that we are serious about wanting many copies of this book printed. Time is precious when you don’t feel well, and I don’t want anyone to have to sit on a waiting list, not knowing when they will finally get a copy.</p>
<h3>The health legacy you leave matters</h3>
<p>It may seem small right now, but what you make in your kitchen today will matter tomorrow.</p>
<p>What you put in your body day after day will affect the beautiful masterpiece that is YOU! And what you cook for your family will also affect them.</p>
<p>You can start making a difference right now by pre-ordering your copy of <strong><i>Hashimoto’s Food Pharmacology</i></strong>. Perhaps get one for a family member or a friend too.</p>
<h3><b>How does this work?</b></h3>
<p>I designed this campaign so that your support helps the greater cause, and you get fantastic perks. Each level is different. Simply click on each perk (on the right-hand side) for a full description. Then click ""Get This Perk"" when you find the one that’s best for you! You'll fill out your order details, including your shipping address (if the perk includes the new cookbook).<br/><br/>Be sure to check out the FAQs for shipping info.</p>
<p>Your support of this campaign will help make a lasting impact. Thanks for helping me leave a legacy for my loved ones. Together, we will make a difference.<br/> </p>

For a long time, you guys have asked me to create a cookbook with healing food recipes because many of you have tried countless diets without experiencing real improvement or have even gotten sicker. My cookbook is different because it teaches you how to support yourself through digestive enzymes, and proper nutrients.
FOOD PHARMACOLOGY is filled with tools, strategies and over 125 delicious recipes to help refresh your body so that it can begin the healing process. And while most of the recipes are quite simple, there are some fancier ones for those special occasions!

Creating to Empower
I love creating new material, and I am touched each time someone shares how their life is changed by the tools I share. Maybe this cookbook will help others who are struggling to make sense of their condition find hope and relief from their symptoms.
What if your own health breakthrough started with nutrition?
I invite you to join the narrative and to take back control of your health. I believe your story is special and I hope you feel empowered with the solutions I provide in my cookbook

But I need your help
Here’s a little publishing secret...it’s really expensive to print beautiful, full color books like my cookbook, so the publisher is only agreeing to print a small number of copies at first. Please help me show them that there is a high demand within our community by pre-ordering your copy today.
By doing so enables us to get this out to the masses, making it mainstream for the millions of people who have Hashimoto's, thyroid disease and other autoimmune conditions.
I also want to get it in the hands of doctors and other healthcare professionals to use as a tool in guiding people to wellness.
I need your help to make this happen...

What happens if the campaign is a success?
Then this book gets printed, and we celebrate! The publisher will give the “green light” to print more copies which will help reach thousands of people with autoimmune conditions who need this information to heal.
I wanted to make sure that our campaign backers received amazing prizes, so everyone who supports this mission at the $29 pledge level or above is guaranteed to have a beautiful hardcover copy reserved for them.
Plus, that’s just the beginning. I get to reward you with even more nurturing prizes from our exclusive list. Click on each perk for a full description and find the one that’s best for you!
My favorite is the No-Brainer because you get four cookbooks! One for you and three for your friends and family - hello holiday shopping solution :) This prize also includes the Root Cause eBook, the digital version of the Thyroid Secret, the Root Cause Reset, bonus recipes and the intro/first chapter from my book.
If not?
If we don’t reach our goal then the publisher will only print a limited quantity and the book won't reach the people who need it the most. The wait to get the book could be weeks or months long and the worst part? The book may never be printed in larger quantities which could mean that practitioners and doctors and people just like you and me won’t get this vital information. Please help me and join this mission to show the publisher that we want TONS of copies of this book printed.
Why Indiegogo?
Indiegogo gives us a platform to send a clear signal to the publisher that we are serious about wanting many copies of this book printed. Time is precious when you don’t feel well, and I don’t want anyone to have to sit on a waiting list, not knowing when they will finally get a copy.
The health legacy you leave matters
It may seem small right now, but what you make in your kitchen today will matter tomorrow.
What you put in your body day after day will affect the beautiful masterpiece that is YOU! And what you cook for your family will also affect them.
You can start making a difference right now by pre-ordering your copy of Hashimoto’s Food Pharmacology. Perhaps get one for a family member or a friend too.
How does this work?
I designed this campaign so that your support helps the greater cause, and you get fantastic perks. Each level is different. Simply click on each perk (on the right-hand side) for a full description. Then click ""Get This Perk"" when you find the one that’s best for you! You'll fill out your order details, including your shipping address (if the perk includes the new cookbook).Be sure to check out the FAQs for shipping info.

<p>As the owner of a <a href=""http://www.modernsoapmaking.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">popular soapmaking blog and resource</a>, some of the most common questions I get is about essential oils: </p>
<p><i>What essential oils go together?</i></p>
<p><i>Where can I find essential oil blends for soapmaking?</i></p>
<p><i>How do I know how much of a blend to use in a product?</i></p>
<p>I've done my best to answer these questions through articles on my blog, <a href=""http://www.modernsoapmaking.com/tag/essential-oils/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">like this series on essential oils that explains how to use them, how to blend them, and how to calculate usage rates</a>. I've compiled <a href=""http://www.modernsoapmaking.com/product/50-eo-blends/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">50 of my favorite essential oil blends created with my own two hands in an ebook</a> that has sold over a thousand of copies. </p>
<p>And yet, the questions keep coming. <i>What if I could answer them in an interactive way that helped soapmakers learn and find what they're looking for easier?</i></p>
<p><strong>This project is that answer.</strong></p>
<p>Modern Soapmaking is developing an essential oil calculator that will accomplish all of the above, and I need your help to make it come to life! <strong>Soapmakers will be able to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Search a database of essential oil blends by choosing up to three essential oils to find in blends in the library (<i>The library will include 250+ blends from my own formulary on launch.</i>)</li>
<li>Submit their own essential oil blends to be added to the library, with full credit to their creation. (<i>Supporters have the opportunity to submit blends in advance and have them featured in the search results!</i>)</li>
<li>Calculate the usage rate of any essential oil blend, no matter if it's their own personal blend or one from the library. (<i>Usage rates will be calculated based on scent load per product category with consideration to current IFRA Standards.</i>)</li>
</ul>
<p>It will finally be easy for soapmakers to <u>safely</u> use essential oils in their products, and create unique products scented with essential oil blends! <strong>And it will be available to all users of Modern Soapmaking's website, free of charge!</strong></p>
<ul></ul>
<h3>Essential Oil Blend Calculator Mockups</h3>
<p>Want a sneak peek into the development mockups? Here's what we're working on:</p>
<p><strong>The <i>Find a Blend</i> interface</strong>, where a soapmaker can choose up to three essential oils they have on hand to check the library of blends. Notice the <i>Featured Blend</i> at the top of the page that will randomly display one featured blend from our Featured Sponsors!</p>

<p><strong>The <i>usage rate calculator</i> at work, </strong>showing the usage rate information for a sample blend. Notice the alert about the restricted essential oils, and the scent load options!

<p>It all started about twelve years ago, when we opened our
little clinic in Calgary, Alberta. We were providing homeopathic remedies for
everyday health concerns, but even more than that, we created a space for our
clients to come and feel comfortable talking about their concerns and
struggles. We started to understand that medicine is everything from a hug, or
listening, to finding the right remedy. Whether it was seasonal allergies, a
stubborn cough, or a screaming baby at 3 am, we were able to provide relief to
our clients when they needed it most.</p>
<p>Our mission was to be able to share both relief and health
with families all across Canada, but being just one clinic limited our reach.
After more than a decade of prescribing homeopathic remedies, we started to
create formulas that use the remedies that our clients consistently have
success with, and are bringing them to you as the Mederi family of products.</p>
<p>Mederi is a Latin word that means ""to heal"" and it
is the word that medicine is derived from. Our philosophy is that medicine should be simple, effective, and trustworthy,
without any harmful chemicals or harsh side-effects. Hippocrates said ""let
your food be your medicine,"" and we have created the Mederi family of
products to be as safe and wholesome as the food your give your family.</p>

<p>We are looking to raise a total of $50,000 to help with the final production run. Any additional funds will be used to help develop new products and allow us to work on bringing Mederi to the international market.</p>

<h3>Why you should help</h3> <p></p>
<p>Hi, my name is Kim and I'm the Operations Manager for Xerion
Dispensary. I've had the pleasure of working with Erin for the past year, but
she has been one of my best friends for a long time. While most people would
just describe her as an entrepreneur, the first words that come to mind when I
think of Erin are ""helper"" and ""nurturer"". Erin is driven
by passion - at first it may seem like that passion is for business and homeopathy,
but if you look a little closer, you'll see that her passion is really all
about helping others. It doesn't matter if you're her best friend or a complete
stranger, Erin will find a way to help make your life better.</p>
<p>In the 12 years she's been in business, her success has been
measured by the stories of the lives she's impacted and people she's helped.
The couch in her clinic became a sacred space where people could just sit and talk
about whatever they needed to get off their chest. Erin learned that sometimes,
a hug and a chance to be heard is the most effective medicine, and this
philosophy has been central to Xerion Dispensary.</p>
<p>When the Health Canada submission number came in for Mozi-Q,
we celebrated. It was the start of a new adventure, but more importantly it was
a chance to help people who couldn't make it into the clinic.</p>
<p>I came on board because I believed in Erin and wanted to
help her succeed, but it didn't take long for me to fall in love with what I
had gotten myself into. In my first week, I ended up talking to a woman who
called, ecstatic that Mozi-Q was so effective for her. We ended up talking for
30 minutes, and she told me that after her father died of West Nile, Mozi-Q
gave her hope that other families wouldn't have to go through what she did. As
I listened to her story I started to cry, and by the time I hung up the phone I
was inspired. I understood that it wasn't about ego or recognition, our goal
was to make a difference and have an impact.</p>
<p>Mederi is the next step in our journey. We've talked a lot
about how we could bring the clinic and its couch to people around the world,
and the formulas of the Mederi products are the closest we can get to bottling
up that experience. We have regulatory approval and packaging, but we need your
help to get the first run of products made. If you have sat on our couch and
been helped out, or are just inspired to share an experience like that with
others, please contribute to our project.</p>

I'm currently paying for college with student loans and scholarships, and I make under or around $100 a week.

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I don't really know how to describe how much of an impact this surgery would have on me other than it would be an absolute dream come true. </p>
<p>There are so many little things that are difficult for a trans woman to deal with. I would be able to wear a swimsuit in public without having to wear shorts. I would be able to date people, and talk to people I'm attracted to, without worrying about them no longer being interested, or even worse becoming violent, when they learn what my body is like. I would be able to have sex with my partner without having to stop from breaking down in tears.</p>
<p>Having this surgery would allow me to be able to focus on helping other people. I want to do personal finance work when I finish my degree. I want to help people be able to afford their dreams. Saving up for and affording surgery gets in the way of this for me though. I want to start my own credit union to help people in need, but the cost of surgery is in the way of me being able to save up to start a business. </p>
<p>On top of financial work, I plan on remaining very active in the trans community (and the lgbtq community as a whole) for the rest of my life. I want to be someone people can come to for help, and to be there for people who need help the most. I've worked with friends who have been kicked out of their house for being trans, people whose entire families have ostracized them, people who have lost everything they own, people who live in poverty and homelessness, and people who have attempted to kill themselves because of how stressful the struggle of being trans is sometimes. I want so badly to be able to ""not have to worry about myself"" so I can devote as much energy as I possibly can to helping everyone around me.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>$13,000 feels like a lot of money, especially to someone who works minimum wage part-time like me. My yearly salary amounts to roughly $4,500. I'm very much aware of how much money it will take to reach my goal, but I can also say that from the bottom of my heart, not a cent of it will go unappreciated.  </div>

Miriam (Mimi) Rosetti was diagnosed with scoliosis at age 16. Following 6 months wearing a brace, she underwent corrective surgery fusing a large portion of her spine. Nearly 10 years late, in 2005, while simultaneously pursuing a Masters in Applied Positive Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania and delving into her first yoga teacher training at YogaWorks, Mimi began to reconnect with her scoliosis and the impact of her surgery. Since then, she has apprenticed extensively with Deborah Wolk and is certified as a Yoga for Scoliosis teacher through Elise Browning Miller. Mimi spent January 2011 as a student in the medical class at the Iyengar Institute in Pune, India and is currently in the second year of the teacher training at the Iyengar Institute of New York. Mimi lives in Manhattan with her husband and 2 year old daughter. An interview with Mimi.


Susan Turis holds Intermediate Junior I certification from the Iyengar National Association of the US. It wasneck spasms along with the events of 9/11 that led Susan to begin practicing yoga with Senior Iyengar teacher Mary Dunn in 1999. She has been teaching since 2001. The healing qualities that came from Mary's careful instruction changed her life journey. Susan continues to study and assist weekly with James Murphy in specific needs classes at the Iyengar Institute of New York. Her mission as set forth by BKS Iyengar is that Yoga is for everybody, regardless of physical condition or age. The pinnacle of her study comes during extended visits to Pune, India where classes have been led by B.K.S. Iyengar and Geeta, Prashant and Abhijata Iyengar. Susan was born in Brooklyn and lives there with her husband and three children. She earned a degree in psychology from City University of New York, Brooklyn College and has co-founded businesses in real estate and mortgage and insurance brokerage. More about Susan.
Ashlee Willaman began practicing yoga at the age of 13, just around the same time she was diagnosed with scoliosis. Knowing that yoga kept her back pain at bay, she stuck with the practice for the next 20 years and received her 500 hour teacher training from YogaWorks in 2012. Having been a dancer/athlete since her teenage years, she teaches Yoga for Athletes classes with a focus on backcare. She began assisting Deborah Wolk's Backcare Basics class at YUCBS in early 2014.
Andi Wirz is a native of Switzerland. He found his way to yoga through dance and creative movement. He has been studying and teaching the Iyengar method for the last 20 years. Teachers that have influenced him most are Kevin Gardiner, Robin Janis, Donald Moyer and Genny Kapuler. He also studies yoga with the BMC ® approach with Roxlyn Moret and travels every summer with her to Switzerland to teach workshops. Andreas holds a physical education diploma from the University of Basel, Switzerland. He moved to NYC to pursue a career as a modern dancer. He performed with many modern dance companies and spent half a year in Japan performing with the Swiss mime group ""Mummenschanz"". More about Andiand read A review of Andi's class.

<p></p><p></p></div>","Short SummaryDid you know that 20
million parents of diabetic kids worry EVERY SINGLE NIGHT if their child will be alive in the
morning?
Can
you imagine that?
Sleeping with that fear?
Balancing
insulin against food, prior insulin doses, exercise, stress, illness, hormones
and many other factors, is an unrelenting,
stressful guessing-game.
And
to make matters worse, insulin dosing is a best guess – even for
doctors.
As
a result, 78 million insulin-using adults also fear modifying
their doses and their routine.
The
current solution consists of


an expensive $5000
Continuous Glucose Monitor, with a sensor that pierces the skin for 3-7 days
(ouch!)


an expensive $8000
Insulin Pump, with a tube that pierces the skin for 3 days (ouch again!).


The
alternative? Waking up through the night for blood tests, or hoping for the
best. Guesswork. Paper and pen.ManageBGL solves
the overnight problem, by accurately predicting dangerous low blood sugar
levels eight hours ahead. This is a world
first, with 2 provisional patents granted and 7 more to follow.
ManageBGL solves
the dosing problem, by calculating doses
and tracking prior insulins, exercise, food etc, and using prediction to
determine which doses were incorrect, and fixing them.





Currently we use a
high-end server to perform the sophisticated calculations required. 
Next we need a native app
running directly on smart phones and tablets, with the ability to run offline -
in a plane, overseas, and without an internet connection.
Let's make it an app!

Sample prediction trace (Note, this is NOT from a $5000 CGM!):

All the curves are predictions. Orange circles are actual blood tests, blue shading is the ideal zone, the dark blue line is the blood sugar target, the green bar is 'now' - everything to the right is a prediction.  We also provide, for the first time, INSTANT SHARING of everything - blood sugars, insulin and carbs - as well as predictions. This makes it far easier for everyone from grandparents to teachers to manage diabetic kids properly.What We Need & What You GetAll the features we describe here are already done. Currently, the ManageBGL website is only available on phones with an internet connection - but it needs to work in planes, overseas and out of coverage areas, such as in buildings.
We need $30,000 to make medical-grade native apps that are beautiful, fast, easy-to-use, and patient-centric, not doctor-centric, which will work both online and offline. 
This awesome native app for iOS AND Android will provide:

Dose calculation, with fat and protein too

Precision tracking of insulin remaining

Prediction of blood sugars for the next 8 hours, giving confidence when sleeping, going out etc

Suggestions for dose changes (that are not phrased in legal-ese)


Instant sharing of ALL data from school to work/home or to any number of carers (Pull, not Push - it doesn't badger everyone with your numbers)

Handles families with multiple people with diabetes easily
Points! The most comprehensive points system ever designed to help track progress. Parents can convert points to financial rewards, iTunes vouchers, or whatever makes sense to their family

Log everything. 38 different logs, from blood sugars, insulin, carbs, eye tests, 3 different levels of exercise, stress, illness etc

Integrate data from 60 different meters, pumps and CGMS devices
Extensive food database for new foods
Integration of information from Personal Health Devices like Fitbit, JawBone, FuelBand, Shine, TicTrak, FitBit, Validic and more
Reporting and more.


If we don't reach our entire goal, we will develop the apps first, and apply compliance and clinical trials progressively

The Impact

Diabetes affects 382 million people worldwide. As an app, ManageBGL will deliver similar health outcomes to an $8000 insulin pump and $5000 CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitor) but at exceptionally low cost - worldwide, not just to first-world countries.


With the ManageBGL app and our prediction system, we can maximize the time that a person's blood sugars spend 'in-range', reducing nasty long term complications like blindness, kidney failure, amputation and stroke, and the huge public health costs associated with these, which we all end up paying for.

ManageBGL gives people with diabetes confidence to sleep at night with a much higher certainty that they will be alive in the morning.
ManageBGL is also very useful for people who are not aware when their blood sugar is low - hypoglycaemic unawareness

One in twenty diabetics under the age of 40 who die in their sleep die of an unknown cause. Low blood sugar is suspected (ie insulin overdose), but is hard to prove because blood sugar drops after death. We reduce this risk.

Testimonials Apart from Lucy and myself, ManageBGL is already helping over 1000 others!

I've had Type 1 diabetes for 24 years, and am the parent of a child with Type 1 diabetes, diagnosed at age 2 (now 9). I understand the difficulties schools and carers have, and ManageBGL is designed to address these

I have an Honours degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I am the software architect and CEO of DataMystic; we have spent the last 14 years producing tools for data conversion, data mining and analytics, as well as building and operating websites with huge numbers of users (DownloadPipe), customer billing systems for major energy retailers, and data warehouses for pharmaceutical companies.


As a person with diabetes, and the parent of a child with diabetes, I understand what patients want - which can be quite different to what doctors want. Diabetes is perhaps the only disease where the doctor prescribes a drug, but doesn't specify how much to have or when to take it. ManageBGL puts these tools in the hands of the patient for the first time, and empowers them to improve their life in a way no doctor can.

Awards

December - presented ManageBGL to doctors at the World Diabetes Congress in Melbourne. Doctors arrived saying 'I don't believe you can predict', and left saying 'that is a Really Clever Idea'.

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hi! My name's Caitlin (McGrory). My dream is to get my 500-hour Yoga Teacher Training. </p>
<p>I am currently in India and 500 hour Teacher Trainings are much more affordable than in the United States. However, I still don't have the budget for it after paying a LOT of money in medical expenses in the West prior to coming here and as in the past, not getting anywhere but diagnoses and lifetime ailment talk.</p>
<p>So I turn back to yoga, again. With more devotion. </p>
<p>In the spirit of energetic give-and-take, I'm happy to offer astrology chats about your life, goals, karmic history/ ""autopilot"" moods and behaviors, and gifts to claim and growth to be had by clearing out those old issues or limiting beliefs or fears that get projected onto 2013. :)</p>

Hi! My name's Caitlin (McGrory). My dream is to get my 500-hour Yoga Teacher Training. 
I am currently in India and 500 hour Teacher Trainings are much more affordable than in the United States. However, I still don't have the budget for it after paying a LOT of money in medical expenses in the West prior to coming here and as in the past, not getting anywhere but diagnoses and lifetime ailment talk.
So I turn back to yoga, again. With more devotion. 
In the spirit of energetic give-and-take, I'm happy to offer astrology chats about your life, goals, karmic history/ ""autopilot"" moods and behaviors, and gifts to claim and growth to be had by clearing out those old issues or limiting beliefs or fears that get projected onto 2013. :)

<h3>The Skinny</h3>
<p>I'm a trans woman, and I've been lucky so far in my transition. A lot of things fell into place for me to make it possible, and even fairly successful. I've been very fortunate to have friends and family support me emotionally and even financially at many different times during the process. I not only survived, I've thrived in ways I didn't think possible when I first approached this.<br/><br/>Last year, I fought for and won arbitration with my employer for coverage of surgery vital to my transition, Gender Reassignment Surgery (GRS). I scheduled my surgery with a well known surgeon in the field as soon as I was able, and preauthorized for the whole thing. The waiting list was long, and my date is coming up in September. Now that I'm here, I've hit a road block.<br/><br/>Financial obligations have made it impossible for me to save enough money to travel and stay in the area. I need you to help me fund this.</p>

<p>I need around $1,500 to fund my trip at a minimum. This includes a cross-country flight, accommodations, local travel (I'll need to take cabs back and forth due to my surgery), and food. Due to the severity of the recovery, I need to stay in the area for around 10 days post-operation, and one night prior.</p>
<p>A cross-country flight from NY to CA will run me around $350. My hotel or other accommodation options are around $1,000+. The more money I'm able to raise, the better my options will be, and closer to my Doctor's office/hospital. I set my goal lower to try to help increase my chances of a successful fundraiser, but at this level, it won't bring me up to where I need to be.<br/><br/>While I'm there, I'll still have a paycheck coming from my job, so I should be able to handle surprises and any extras that always seem to surprise you.

<p>If you’re a pet owner, sooner or later you will experience the fear and anxiety of having your companion go missing. Let’s be honest, even taking the best precautions and care, sooner or later your pet will wander away. Now, suppose there was a simple-to-use, inexpensive system you could depend on to monitor your pet’s location, warn you when they’ve wandered away from your  “safety zone”, and lead you to them quickly before they get in harm’s way? Would such a system give you peace of mind, knowing that your pet is safe? Well, that system is available now and it is already being used by pet owners from Florida to Oregon. It's Marco Polo, and we're the company that invented it.</p>

<p>At Green Bag Lunch, we want to bring kids a healthy, whole foods alternative to pink slime and mystery meat. Our idea is to offer homemade bag lunches for those kids whose parents don't have time to make it themselves, but want to insure a well balanced meal to get them through the day. We will focus on local, organic products when available, and allow a certain level of customization to suit the needs of the children. In addition to the lunches, we will also offer organic baby food and take home meals for the family.</p>
<p>I am a father of three awesome little boys and a chef of twenty years. I am just really tired of the food that kids are served in school, but realize that many people don't have time to do it themselves every day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>The impact of our company is simple; it helps families. It helps children eat better and feel better and gives parents more time to spend with their families.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>What we need to get started is a location, equipment and marketing. We need to be able to find a location that will enable us to get our product out there. We need a steamer, deck oven, mixer, food processer and many small wares. To be successful we have to brand ourselves, including getting a logo and pasting it on everything. We are going to shoot for using all recycled and biodegradable products and using sustainable practices, we know this is the right thing to do, it just costs a little more to get started.</p>

</div><blockquote>
<div> Hi, my name is Brad Davis and I represented Bayside
Secondary School for this past 2014 Cross Country Season.  Throughout my 2 years of running, I have
represented Bayside and have shown my true potential under pressure. I have won
7 Bay of Quinte titles, 6 COSSA titles, and 1 bronze and 1 silver medal in the
Eastern Ontario championships. Recently at the OFSAA level of competition (all
of Ontario), I placed 6<sup>th</sup> in
the 1500m this past track season and 8<sup>th</sup> out of 300 during this past
fall. Through all of my success, there is only one person to thank. That person
is my coach, Dan Tripp. Although during
my first year of running, Tripp and the rest of the teaching staff were unable
to coach their students or participate in any extra-curricular activities,
Tripp found a loop hole and found a way to coach myself and my training
partners. Before I started running, I
had myself mixed into what you would call a “bad crowd”. I wasn’t exactly the
child I was raised to be. Throughout my Grade 9 year in high school, I made
some poor choices.  During grade 9, I was
5’7” tall and weighed 160lbs.  I was
constantly made fun of and bullied on a daily basis. One day, I woke up and wasn’t feeling too
well.  I thought I had just caught a bad
flu. It turned out that I had caught a sickness that caused me to miss a total
of 25 consecutive days of school. I had lost 35 pounds. I started to like the
way I looked so I started working out and going for nightly jogs. Once I started
jogging, I felt more confident. For gym class, we ran what is called the “beep”
test.  Since I had been jogging as often
as I could, I was in good enough shape to get a strong score. Mr. Tripp was
doing recruiting for the cross country team and he somehow saw something in me
and tried to convince me to run on the Bayside Cross Country Team. I liked his
offer but wasn’t sure I wanted to be one of those guys who ran around in
circles with short shorts and over exposing themselves. Later that day a girl
(who i thought was cute but was shy) came to me and said I should join as
well.  I finally, through her
motivational words and kind guidance, decided to join the Cross Country Team. I
went to my first cross country practice and I loved it. Although I wasn’t the best and there were two
other guys that were way better than me, I enjoyed the atmosphere and support
that everyone gave. As I progressed in
the running world, I learned the ways of the other runners and wanted to be the
best on the team. All I wanted from running was to win a race. Unfortunately, I
didn’t win any races that cross country season but that soon changed.  I trained all winter long and at the Track
Season 2012, I won 7 straight races and I finally got my gold medal. Going into
OFSAA track for the first time, I found myself too inexperienced and didn’t believe
that there was any possibility that I would get a top 3 finish. When I came out
of the 1500m finals with a 10<sup>th</sup> place finish, I wasn’t satisfied. So I trained my guts out all summer on the
track and on trails at Zwicks park with my coach. Two of my team mates left for university and
others had other commitments that they couldn’t make it out to practices, so it
was just Mr. Tripp and myself most of the time. Getting to know Mr. Tripp (aka
Tripp) and his accomplishments impressed me greatly. He was always there for me
to pick me up off the ground when i didn’t think I could run another step.
Somehow he always gets a little bit extra out of me. Tripp knows I love to
prove everyone wrong. He will motivate me using the things he knows that get
under my skin to get me to give it that little bit extra that I didn’t even
know I had in me. Tripp is the reason I still run.  He is one-of-a-kind.  In the spring of 2014, Tripp was notified
that he was one of the teachers that would be losing their jobs due to
government cuts.  The whole school was
devastated to know that this incredible teacher, mentor and coach would not be
returning to Bayside for the 2014-2015 School year.  But nothing stops this man.....even though
through a tough loss of his job, he still makes it out to practices to train
the team and myself and makes it out to the important meets so he is there for
us. He makes sure his voice is heard everywhere along the course when we are

<p>Why I want to go to Nationals?</p>
<p>To go to Nationals in Vancouver will give me the opportunity
to show my true colours against the best in the whole country. If I place in
the top 7, I will make my first Team Canada which means I will get to participate
against the best the world has to offer which has always been my dream.  Competing at Nationals is my next goals.  My ultimate dream is to go to the Olympics and
Nationals will be one of the milestones to get me closer to my dream. Every
night, I lay in my bed and imagine myself running against the world’s best
runners and it sends chills down my spine thinking that I am that much closer
to my dream. I want to be the best so badly that I will train in any type of
weather. In my mind, there is “no excuses”. I feel that I will do well at Nationals
as I have proven, in the past, that I run well under pressure. This will be the
chance I need to finally get myself noticed by the best schools in the country,
and the world. With my coach, Dan Tripp, with me, I have no doubt in my mind
that Team Canada is something is doable. 
This has been my dream since I started my athletic journey that some
just call “running”. </p>
<p>Brad Davis</p>
</blockquote></div>","Please take the time to read Brads story below.  We need your help to send Brad to Nationals, every little bit counts, and we are so thankful to share this rare opportunity with you. The school Brad attends does not financially support these athletes past the OFSSA 
level and Brad is hoping to raise $3000 to offset his cost to compete. 


All money graciously donated will go directly to Brad and his coach to cover the cost of competing in nationals.  This includes air fare, car rental, hotel accommodations, registration fees, and meals. 



 Hi, my name is Brad Davis and I represented Bayside
Secondary School for this past 2014 Cross Country Season.  Throughout my 2 years of running, I have
represented Bayside and have shown my true potential under pressure. I have won
7 Bay of Quinte titles, 6 COSSA titles, and 1 bronze and 1 silver medal in the
Eastern Ontario championships. Recently at the OFSAA level of competition (all
of Ontario), I placed 6th in
the 1500m this past track season and 8th out of 300 during this past
fall. Through all of my success, there is only one person to thank. That person
is my coach, Dan Tripp. Although during
my first year of running, Tripp and the rest of the teaching staff were unable
to coach their students or participate in any extra-curricular activities,
Tripp found a loop hole and found a way to coach myself and my training
partners. Before I started running, I
had myself mixed into what you would call a “bad crowd”. I wasn’t exactly the
child I was raised to be. Throughout my Grade 9 year in high school, I made
some poor choices.  During grade 9, I was
5’7” tall and weighed 160lbs.  I was
constantly made fun of and bullied on a daily basis. One day, I woke up and wasn’t feeling too
well.  I thought I had just caught a bad
flu. It turned out that I had caught a sickness that caused me to miss a total
of 25 consecutive days of school. I had lost 35 pounds. I started to like the
way I looked so I started working out and going for nightly jogs. Once I started
jogging, I felt more confident. For gym class, we ran what is called the “beep”
test.  Since I had been jogging as often
as I could, I was in good enough shape to get a strong score. Mr. Tripp was
doing recruiting for the cross country team and he somehow saw something in me
and tried to convince me to run on the Bayside Cross Country Team. I liked his
offer but wasn’t sure I wanted to be one of those guys who ran around in
circles with short shorts and over exposing themselves. Later that day a girl
(who i thought was cute but was shy) came to me and said I should join as
well.  I finally, through her
motivational words and kind guidance, decided to join the Cross Country Team. I
went to my first cross country practice and I loved it. Although I wasn’t the best and there were two
other guys that were way better than me, I enjoyed the atmosphere and support
that everyone gave. As I progressed in
the running world, I learned the ways of the other runners and wanted to be the
best on the team. All I wanted from running was to win a race. Unfortunately, I
didn’t win any races that cross country season but that soon changed.  I trained all winter long and at the Track
Season 2012, I won 7 straight races and I finally got my gold medal. Going into
OFSAA track for the first time, I found myself too inexperienced and didn’t believe
that there was any possibility that I would get a top 3 finish. When I came out
of the 1500m finals with a 10th place finish, I wasn’t satisfied. So I trained my guts out all summer on the
track and on trails at Zwicks park with my coach. Two of my team mates left for university and
others had other commitments that they couldn’t make it out to practices, so it
was just Mr. Tripp and myself most of the time. Getting to know Mr. Tripp (aka
Tripp) and his accomplishments impressed me greatly. He was always there for me
to pick me up off the ground when i didn’t think I could run another step.
Somehow he always gets a little bit extra out of me. Tripp knows I love to
prove everyone wrong. He will motivate me using the things he knows that get
under my skin to get me to give it that little bit extra that I didn’t even
know I had in me. Tripp is the reason I still run.  He is one-of-a-kind.  In the spring of 2014, Tripp was notified
that he was one of the teachers that would be losing their jobs due to
government cuts.  The whole school was
devastated to know that this incredible teacher, mentor and coach would not be
returning to Bayside for the 2014-2015 School year.  But nothing stops this man.....even though
through a tough loss of his job, he still makes it out to practices to train
the team and myself and makes it out to the important meets so he is there for
us. He makes sure his voice is heard everywhere along the course when we are
running.  He always gives the team or
myself what I like to call the “Tripp Talk” which is basically a motivational
speech before every race that will calm the nerves and get you focused on the
more positive things. Tripp is the biggest and best role model any kid my age
could ask for. He has brought me up to the athlete and person I am today. I
continue to learn from him and follow his footsteps as the years go by. 


Why I want to go to Nationals?

<p><strong>The Bakardjiev lab at UCSF is studying how infections during pregnancy affect the placenta and damage the developing baby.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why is this research important?</strong></p>
<p>Infections of the placenta can lead to maternal and fetal illness and death. Preterm labor, for example, is often the result of infection. Every year 15 million neonates are born prematurely. Of these preemies 1.1 million die, and many of the survivors suffer long-term health problems. To improve the health of mothers and children, we need to better understand the mechanisms of placental infections so we can develop strategies to prevent preterm birth and other pregnancy complications.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Our work</strong></p>
<p>We are working with the bacterial pathogen <em>Listeria monocytogenes.</em> Infection of the mother during pregnancy with <em>Listeria </em>causes fetal demise, premature labor, or neonatal disease and death. Infection occurs when humans ingest contaminated food. You may have heard of the recent outbreak of listeriosis that was associated with contaminated cantaloupes from Colorado. From August to October 2011, the outbreak reached 28 states. 146 cases of listeriosis were confirmed, and 30 patients died. The outbreak made national headlines as the deadliest outbreak of foodborne illness since 1924.</p>
<p>We have identified the first fetal cells that become infected in the human placenta upon infection with <em>Listeria</em>. We characterized immune mechanisms of fetal placental cells that fight this bacterium. We've also identified bacterial genes that make it possible for <em>Listeria</em> to overcome the immune defenses of the fetal cells of the placenta.

<p><strong>The big picture</strong></p>
<p>Pregnancy is amazing and challenging! Scientifically there is one overarching and unexplained paradox during pregnancy: how is the mother able to carry a genetically distinct fetus within herself?

<p> </p>
<p>Examples of non-self entities are bacteria and parasites, but non-self entities can also be human tissue, as in the case of an organ transplant. People who receive an organ transplant must take medication to suppress their immune system to keep it from rejecting the new organ. The downside is that transplant recipients are more susceptible to infections. Like an organ transplant, a growing fetus is genetically distinct from its mother. Why does the maternal immune system tolerate the fetus? And how can the fetus be protected against infection under such challenging circumstances? These simple questions remain a mystery.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For a long time people have proposed that pregnant women are immune-suppressed to avoid immune rejection of the baby. But leaving the most important biological task in life to someone who is immune-suppressed and therefore more susceptible to infections does not seem like a smart strategy! Indeed, more recent scientific evidence suggests that this is really not true. The unique organ that mediates an immunological truce between mother and fetus, and protects the baby from infection, is the placenta.</p>

When I did this video it really hit me how hard it was for her family. I have been around CC, Max, Annette and her husband Anthony quite a few times but had never talked to the kids or her hubby about the Lung Transplant (the Elephant in the room). When I did this video it broke my heart to see Annette SPEACHLESS and then teary eyed... (she ran off right after I stopped filming). She deserves to have her mom there to hold her. I will do anything I can to make that possible for her.
Anything you can do will help! Please DONATE &/OR SHARE!

<h3>I am Carolin, my husband Chase is a c6-c7 quad. paralyzed from the chest down as of age 15 when he was hit by a car walking across a road. He is the best husband and father. It however has been hard going places and he him self has never had the freedom of driving. If we could get a handicap friendly,or better yet possibly with hand controls, it would change our family and open a whole new world to him. Up until now we have had a 95 jeep that I as his wife would pick him up and put him in should we need to go anywhere. This is very hard for us both. Now as of today we have NO CAR because as I was driving down our dirt road we live on a white truck ran me and my daughter off the road and into the ditch killing our poor jeep. Thank god my 8yr old daughter Alyzia and I are OK... but we now more than ever need something.</h3>

<p>The 2012-2013 curling season is nearly upon us, and it proves to be a very important one for Team Shuster. With the 2014 Olympic Trials to take place in December of 2013, this year’s USA Men’s National Championships will not only crown this year’s National Champion, it will also determine the final 2 spots at the Olympic Trials.</p>
<p>Last season, Team Shuster narrowly missed capturing one of the first two Olympic Trials berths by finishing 3rd at the 2012 USA National Championships. Thus, the team looks forward to the upcoming season with lofty goals. Building off that 3rd place finish in our inaugural campaign, we will be traveling across North America looking for the best training and competitive opportunities to better that finish.</p>
<p><strong>Why we need your help:</strong></p>
<p>With John L. and Jared being full-time students, and Jeff and John S. only working part time jobs to leave time for training and travel, competing expenses are difficult to come by.</p>
<p>There are limited resources allocated to elite athletes by USA Curling, however, teams like ours who are not already qualified for the Olympic Trials are forced to bear most of the burden of those competing costs ourselves.  (John L. and Jared each receive a small amount from USA Curling's Project 2018 Program)</p>
<p>Last season, our competing costs, which include entry fees, lodging, and travel, topped $10,000.  This upcoming season, our competing costs will be over $11,000.  With just a few sponsors already onboard, we are looking to raise $7000 more so we can put together a competition schedule that can prepare us to win a National Championship, putting us in the 2014 Olympic Trials.</p>

They were chilling out after working hard at the restaurant and having a good time when they left their drinks at the bar to go to the bathroom. Well that happens to be the last thing Riki remembers for the night up until he woke up screaming and crying in pain.</p><p>Anyway, Riki and Pedro came back and apparently drank a little more at the bar and went to a nearby park to have a few more beers (according to Pedro). Now Riki isn't one to drink till he's smashed drunk but granted he may have been drugged.</p><p>While at the park Riki, Pedro and Pedro's girlfriend were hanging out enjoying some more beer and then Pedro and his girlfriend went to the bathroom. Upon returning they found poor Riki on the floor crying, screaming and throwing up from the pain. He was then promptly taken to the emergency room where they found out his knee was broken. After going to the clinic the next day Riki found out he needs immediate surgery!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/745407/files/20140726111151-Riki_and_Pedro.JPG?1406398311"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Riki and Pedro dressing up for Halloween!<p><b>Why he needs us:</b></p><p>Riki is a rich man, well rich in love and compassion. Unfortunately, like many of us he is not the richest in money. But that's ok! Because he has wonderful people like you who are willing to donate even the smallest amount to help him out. The money you contribute will go towards his knee surgery and hopefully also to his rehabilitation.</p><p>Because of his injury Riki is unable to work as a server (a job he kicks ass at!), the pain is preventing him from concentrating on his studies and of course there is the obvious: He can't leave the house because he lives on the second floor with no elevator!!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/745411/files/20140726111514-riki_robin_and_marco.JPG?1406398514"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Riki chillin with Robin and Marco at Lotus where they work together.<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Why he deserves our help:</b></p><p>We might be biased but we think Riki is an awesome dude! He puts his all into everything he does including his job, his education and his relationships which is why it would be worthwhile for you to help this wonderful friend get back on his feet.</p><p>Personally when I (Ben) worked with him at Lotus he would always treat me well. As a runner/busser I wasn't always very much respected but Riki got me. He would always remember to say thank you and even kick in some extra tip to show how much he appreciated all the work I was doing.</p><p>Moreover Riki is a dedicated server at Lotus who always puts the customer first. He takes orders and delivers food at lightning speed all while making the customer happy.</p><p>Riki is a hard working student earning his BFA in writing and directing at the Academy of Arts University San Francisco. He hopes to work in the entertainment industry and bring his amazing vision to life. But he's multi-talented! He also studies programming, music, the fine art of bartending and much more!</p><p>Whenever I have problems he always listens and relates to what I say. Riki is a true friend that deserves a little help from awesome people like you!</p><p>With this money Riki can fix his knee and get better which is just what he needs to get back to making people happy!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/745413/files/20140726111620-riki_and_the_gang.jpg?1406398580"" src="""" style=""""/></p>From left to right: Pedro, Desmond, ME (Ben), and Riki. We're all happy hanging out together after working hard at Lotus.<p><b>What you can do:</b></p><p>We know that money is tight these days what with the economy the way it is and all. But the truth is there is strength in numbers. This means that even if you can't donate a whole lot it's ok! The important thing is that you follow these two principles:</p><p>1. Donate what you think you can. Even a dollar gets Riki closer to recovery.</p><p>2. Even if you can't donate (or you have) remember to share this with others in the hope that fellow generous souls will contribute to this noble cause.</p><p>Riki needs us! So whatever you can contribute will help him a great deal! Always remember that we're sending out much love to anyone who lends a helping hand whether it's through donating or just spreading the word to help this amazing friend!</p><p><br/></p><p>Thanks!

Well that happens to be the last thing Riki remembers for the night up until he woke up screaming and crying in pain.Anyway, Riki and Pedro came back and apparently drank a little more at the bar and went to a nearby park to have a few more beers (according to Pedro). Now Riki isn't one to drink till he's smashed drunk but granted he may have been drugged.While at the park Riki, Pedro and Pedro's girlfriend were hanging out enjoying some more beer and then Pedro and his girlfriend went to the bathroom. Upon returning they found poor Riki on the floor crying, screaming and throwing up from the pain. He was then promptly taken to the emergency room where they found out his knee was broken. After going to the clinic the next day Riki found out he needs immediate surgery!Riki and Pedro dressing up for Halloween!Why he needs us:Riki is a rich man, well rich in love and compassion. Unfortunately, like many of us he is not the richest in money. But that's ok! Because he has wonderful people like you who are willing to donate even the smallest amount to help him out. The money you contribute will go towards his knee surgery and hopefully also to his rehabilitation.Because of his injury Riki is unable to work as a server (a job he kicks ass at!), the pain is preventing him from concentrating on his studies and of course there is the obvious: He can't leave the house because he lives on the second floor with no elevator!!Riki chillin with Robin and Marco at Lotus where they work together.Why he deserves our help:We might be biased but we think Riki is an awesome dude! He puts his all into everything he does including his job, his education and his relationships which is why it would be worthwhile for you to help this wonderful friend get back on his feet.Personally when I (Ben) worked with him at Lotus he would always treat me well. As a runner/busser I wasn't always very much respected but Riki got me. He would always remember to say thank you and even kick in some extra tip to show how much he appreciated all the work I was doing.Moreover Riki is a dedicated server at Lotus who always puts the customer first. He takes orders and delivers food at lightning speed all while making the customer happy.Riki is a hard working student earning his BFA in writing and directing at the Academy of Arts University San Francisco. He hopes to work in the entertainment industry and bring his amazing vision to life. But he's multi-talented! He also studies programming, music, the fine art of bartending and much more!Whenever I have problems he always listens and relates to what I say. Riki is a true friend that deserves a little help from awesome people like you!With this money Riki can fix his knee and get better which is just what he needs to get back to making people happy!From left to right: Pedro, Desmond, ME (Ben), and Riki. We're all happy hanging out together after working hard at Lotus.What you can do:We know that money is tight these days what with the economy the way it is and all. But the truth is there is strength in numbers. This means that even if you can't donate a whole lot it's ok! The important thing is that you follow these two principles:1. Donate what you think you can. Even a dollar gets Riki closer to recovery.2. Even if you can't donate (or you have) remember to share this with others in the hope that fellow generous souls will contribute to this noble cause.Riki needs us! So whatever you can contribute will help him a great deal! Always remember that we're sending out much love to anyone who lends a helping hand whether it's through donating or just spreading the word to help this amazing friend!Thanks! Much Love!Ben and Ivy",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

My name is Lisbeth Russell aka Black Betty, I am a freelance illustrator, nerd and food maniac from Scandinavia. I have been living in the dusty West of Australia since 2005, and through my travels, sticking my dirty toes in the ganges in India to spotting howler monkeys in The Amazon Rainforest, I have met some pretty fine people out there that have changed my perception on life, challenged my ideas and just generally made me feel a whole lot of love. I am alive and I am grateful for the life I have lived so far, and all the years to come. I have plans for the future. I want to go back to India and work with children. I also want to check out Canada with my amazing boyfriend. I want to help others. I also have plans to eat more french toast. One day I might even want a family. I have dreams. Everyone deserves to live a happy and fulfilled life, following the dreams that are true to them. In the scheme of things, if one person is happy and full of love, it spreads leaps and bounds and it affects other people, even animals and our environment. You may have met complete strangers who have passed you on the street smiling, and you may have wondered 'gurh, do I have porridge in my beard again?', but no, no sweet leftover breakfast dangling. They were just smiling. And some days, their smile makes you smile too, even when it feels awkward. But that ain't too bad. At least you are smiling. Through that smile, you may make someone else's day better, you may flick a switch in someone else just through your own determination to be joyful. </p><p>  Enough babble, I think you get the idea. My two buddies, Kylie Farrell and Brad O'Brien both have cancer. </p><p>  Kylie is an amazing chef with an unstoppable drive when it comes to her friends and family. She's honest, true and incredibly giving, even now going through this rough time, Kylie has MORE than enough to give to her loved ones. Incredible. Kylie has already had to deal with this cancer culprit once before, so NOW is the time to knock the bugger on the head. Kylie inspires me to speak up and be the strong woman I aspire to be with sass and determination! All the love to this powerful Goddess!</p><p>  My dear friend Brad is another kettle of fish, yet they both share the experience of having this illness once before in their life. Brad is like a brother to me. He is larger than life, in so many ways. I am amazed to witness the lifestyle changes he has been through these last two months. His energy blows me away and leaves me inspired to keep pursuing eating organics, living healthy and making sure I have more than enough awesome vibes to share around. I love you man.</p><p>  Kylie and Brad are both young, early 30's.They both have dreams and plans. Without them in my life, I wouldn't be who I am today. It's a massive journey.. I dont think I have talked so much about enemas in my entire life! but seriously though, even in Australia, different treatments, organic fruit and veggies, MSM, enemas, medicine, consultations and so forth, all cost money. So.. all my love heading their way, along with my nifty painting skills, using gouache for the first time, I want to boost these two amazing people with money which they can put towards whatever they feel is important for them to help heal, so they can get back on track. </p><p></p><p></p><h3>I am donating two paintings and a shitload of vinyl stickers!</h3><p>My paintings are 100% original and inspired by my journey into the Amazon, when I pursued my own truth and healing. There are two individual pieces up for grabs!</p><p>1st painting: Amazon Kayapo Tribe child, gouache on canvas, purple with dark blue face paint. 36CMX25CM. </p><p>2nd painting: Amazon Kayapo Tribe child, gouache on canvas, pale green with purple and red face paint. 30CMX24CM.  </p><p>Small donations are awesome too, anything helps! everyone who donates $10.00 and over, gets a FREE set of vinyl stickers with my designs! </p><p>ALL funds will be split between Brad and Kylie to go towards whatever they need right now. </p><p>When the deadline for the campaign is hit, I will make the winners of the paintings official on my website <a href=""http://www.jazzombie.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.jazzombie.com</a> and on the facebook event page <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/290222654487671/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/events/290222654487671/</a>!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Through your donation, you remember, honour and love everyone who has been through hardship.

Designs for the World LLC
creates and manufactures humanitarian and medical products for people in
developing nations, in disaster areas, and in war zones.  We use our experience in engineering,
biology, and project management to innovate for the 5.8 billion people who do
not live in industrialized nations.  We
invite you to learn about our lead innovation for the underserved 83% of
humanity.
Infant Mortality in the Developing World


Of the 4 million babies who
die each year, 99% are born in developing nations.

1.8 million of these
infants who are born premature and at-risk perish from hypothermia.  More than 3 of the newest residents of the
Earth die every minute.


Access to working incubators
would improve the survival of newborns.
The Tikü™
Incubator


The Tikü™ works without
electricity, unlike conventional incubators that often fail in regions without reliable
electrical power.

The Tikü™ is
portable, simple-to-use, requires virtually no maintenance, and is
available to mothers in remote locations.

The Tikü™ costs a
fraction of the price of conventional incubators.

The Tikü™ helps to
isolate baby from the insect hosts of malaria, dengue fever, encephalitis,
sleeping sickness, and leishmaniasis.
How You Can Help Us Get the Tikü™ to Babies Who Need It


Your support will enable us
to fabricate several incubators for evaluation.

After testing by biomedical
technologists at St. Petersburg College, the incubators will be assessed for
approval of manufacturing and quality by the FDA and the ISO.

These incubators will then be
demonstrated to caregivers in Haiti and gifted to local humanitarian agencies.

We may then
respond to the interest in procuring the incubators by governmental,
humanitarian, and religious organizations.

Our Thanks for Your Help


For those of you who wish
to contribute, we shall pay forward 7% of your donations to the Children’s
Dream Fund, which is a charitable organization that has been helping make the
dreams come true for children with life-threatening illnesses for over three
decades.

Your gift will bring happiness to kids who are fighting
the pain and uncertainty of chronic illness, in addition to helping us provide
the gift of life to babies with the Tikü™.
If
you are unable to contribute, please share news of our campaign with
your friends and families by way of email and social media.  Your outreach through Facebook, Twitter,
Google+, LinkedIn, Instagram, and other media will help us to spread our
message about the Tikü™.  Take
advantage of the sharing tools of Indiegogo. 
PLEASE SHARE OFTEN and help us to reach our goal!

The Gift of Children


Virtually every family has
been touched by the birth of a premature or at-risk baby who has struggled for
life from the moment of entry into the world.

Fortunately, most of us
have been blessed by having access to proper medical care that has enabled us
to start our lives and later to have families of our own.

Your help will allow us to
provide caregivers with a new and versatile incubator that will give a chance
for life to many babies in the developing world.

We appreciate your
generosity...but mostly

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h3> Hi.  I am Kathy's cousin.  The following is her story in her own words...</h3><p>My name is Kathy Abbott and I am a 29 year old mother of three beautiful children and wife to my amazing husband.  At the age of five I was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes.  My family and I managed my condition as best we could but when I was eight it was found that my diabetes had triggered epilepsy as well.  Thankfully, as I grew older, my medication and hormones changed and I grew out of the epilepsy at around thirteen.</p><p>Meanwhile, from the time of my diagnosis, my life has been a constant shuffle of doctors, specialist appointments, highs and lows (especially in regards to my sugar levels) and learning the signs and triggers of hyper and hypo glycemic episodes (fits) which can lead to memory loss at one end of the scale and coma/death at the other.</p><p>Because of my disease no part of my life was ever normal.  My mother was so concerned about my blood sugar levels it affected my ability to participate in school sports or have sleep-overs with friends.  I remember going to birthday parties and watching all the other kids eat lollies and race around like kids should, but I was just a bystander.  In my mid-teens, my ability or inability to have children was discussed.  I was told that it would be extremely hard for me to have or conceive children as it could lead to sporadic blood sugar levels and miscarriage.</p><p>When I was 19 I met Chris, my now husband, through mutual friends.  I had never known anybody so intent on knowing as much as possible about my condition.  While his workmates would take their Playboy magazines to read on their lunch breaks, Chris would read up on medical books, leaflets and anything else he could source to help me manage my illness.  His support, understanding and desire to get me as healthy as possible and keep me there is what enabled us to conceive our first baby at the age of 21.</p><p>We were in such a state of disbelief that we did several tests and even after the doctors confirmed it, we found it hard to believe.  Sadly, due to my unstable sugar levels, we miscarried in the first trimester. I can't put into words how that felt.  I felt like such a failure; we'd done our very best, but our very best brought us heartache like we'd never known.  Throughout all the appointments, tests, scripts, happiness and sadness, Chris was my rock and always there for me.  I kind of waited for him to just get tired of it all and leave but he never did.</p><p>When we married in 2006, I didn't realise I was pregnant again.  I found out just before we suffered yet another loss.  After the third miscarriage, the emotional pain had taken its toll.  I couldn't handle any more disappointment and grief.  I decided the doctors were right - it was going to be next to impossible for us to have children and I was done. </p><p>During the following months a specialist in Mackay prescribed me a new and better insulin and referred me to an opthamologist (a diabetic eye care specialist).  There I was diagnosed with diabetic retinopathy, a condition that damages the blood vessels inside the retina leading to vision loss and blindness.  The procedure to correct this would prove to be both painful and costly.</p><p>We took several trips from Mackay to Brisbane for laser eye surgery and a victrectomy (surgery to remove vitreous humor from the eye).  It took months of pain and eyecare. I was completely reliant on Chris to get me to doctors' appointments as I couldn't drive.  Even getting around the house was difficult and I needed help with just about everything.  Still, Chris was there for me.</p><p>While all this was going on, I fell pregnant yet again.  I didn't allow myself to get excited this time as I was certain it would end the same way as before. However, after four months, I started to believe that maybe the newly prescribed insulin was keeping my blood sugar levels in check and this pregnancy was going to last!  We had finally made it this far!  We made the decision to move back to Dalby to be closer to family and to the medical treatment I was recieving in Brisbane. </p><p>At 28 weeks, my health began to waiver.  My blood pressure went through the roof, so high that it alone should have killed me.  As I recall, it was 240/160!  The staff at Toowoomba Hospital tried for two days to stabilise my pre-eclemspia to no avail.  I was transferred to the Mater Hospital in Brisbane where they informed me upon arrival and observation that at only 28 weeks and five days gestation our baby was to be born via emergency cesarean.  I was terrified.  How could he make it?  How could he possibly survive?</p><p>When Noah was born on the 8th of October 2009, he was immediately rushed to the Special Care Unit and attached to the various machines that would give him his only chance of survival.  I was taken to the Intensive Care Unit where I was stabilised for two weeks. All I had was a photograph of my baby until I was well enough to be wheeled down to see my tiny boy.  When I look back on the day it finally happened, I feel so overwhelmed.  I was elated, but because of my eye surgeries, I could barely see him.  It didn't matter though because he was alive!  All 1.2 kilos of him, fighting to survive.</p><p>Over the next three months, Noah stayed in the special care unit and day by day, grew stronger. Chris and I learned how to care for our premature baby who still relied on oxygen and a nasal tube for feeding.  Christmas of that year, I got the most amazing gift of all - we got to bring our miracle home.  Although he still required oxygen and suffered chronic lung disease, he was home...with us. </p><p>Noah remained on oxygen for the first seven months of his life.  Chris and I had to carry the oxygen tanks everywhere we went until his lungs grew strong enough. Our little boy had bettered the odds!  Throughout all the doctors, peadiatricians, physiotherapists and sleep studies appointments he had along the way, Noah was diagnosed with spastic diplegia, a type of cerebral palsy that mainly affects the mobility of the lower half of his body.  Months of physiotherapy was required and when Noah started walking despite the odds stacked against him, I was so proud!  I have drawn all of my strength and inspiration from watching my boy defy the doctors' predictions.</p><p>Shortly after Noah's first birthday we received one hell of a shock when we discovered we were expecting...TWINS!  I was already considered high risk due to my own health and previous complications during pregnancy and birth and now I was carrying twins, doubling the load on my body.  Despite all these factors I remained stable until I reached 24 weeks.  Again I was diagnosed with pre-eclampsia and admitted to the Brisbane Mater Hospital where they are equipped to handle premature twins if I went into early labour.  Chris, Noah and I stay at the Ronald McDonald house until I went into labour at 31 weeks.  Unable to stop the labour, another emergency cesarean was performed.</p><p>During the surgery, I lost over two litres of blood, flat-lined, was resuscitated and required a blood transfusion.  But in between all the drama, I actually got to hold Phoebe, one of my twin girls.  It was an experience I had missed out on two out of three times. Emily was rushed to the neonatal incubator.  I managed to recover in the Intensive Care Unit and my baby girls, although premature, were in good health.  However, throughout my pregnancy my kidney function began to deteriorate.</p><p>I handled life okay for the first few months, but eventually diabetes, high blood pressure, newborn twins, a child with cerebral palsy and waning kidney function became too much for me and I realised I needed help.  Once again, Chris was there for me.  Still.  He stopped working and stayed home to help me manage the family and my health.  A few months later, a career opportunity arose for Chris back near Mackay so we packed up again and headed north.</p><p>We settled into our new life and home in Mackay and Chris was doing well in his job.  The only downfall was he had to travel three and a half hours to work and worked ten days away at a time.  So I was left in a new town without a vehicle, three children under three, managing Noah's CP, the twins' teething and of course, my own health.  I struggled for a year and a half before we decided a move to Moranbah, nearer to where Chris worked would make life easier.  Not only was it cheaper living, it also meant Chris could come home every day and be home sooner if I needed him urgently.</p><p>It was a good decision as I had begun having dizzy spells from diminishing iron levels.  Follow-up tests were done and I was sent to a renal specialist.  Further testing showed my kidney function was as low as 17%.  When I was given this news it felt like something out of the movies.  Everything went quiet.  I could see the doctor speaking, the kids playing on the office floor, Chris looking at me and holding my hand, but there was no sound.  There was just this raw fear and uncertainty.   And millions of questions.  I remember being so, so scared.</p><p>I was informed that while my kidney function would continue to drop, I would have to wait until it dropped to 10% before I could start dialysis.  By the time it got that low I was basically bedridden.  It actually turned out to be at 6% before I had my first procedure for hemodialysis, which involved having a catheter inserted into my neck, across my lungs and resting on my heart to clean and filter my blood.</p><p>The next day I had to go under anaesthesia to have the peritoneal dialysis catheter operation.  What was meant to be a routine day operation ended with me spending a week in hospital from a bleeding complication.  For two and a half days I bled out.  The staff tried to apply (excruciating!) pressure to stem the blood flow, otherwise another operation would've been necessary.  I was so anaemic that I needed an iron infusion before going home.</p><p>PD (peritoneal dialysis) was my preferred method of treatment for renal failure as I had more freedom with my diet and busy lifestyle and I could do it anywhere as long as it was sterile. A PET test also confirmed it as the best method for me as the membrane where the fluid sits likes to be wet. Renal failure occurs when the kidneys can no longer adequately filter waste products from the blood.  But the catheter for PD had to be in place for six weeks before it could be used.  Meanwhile, it was necessary for me to continue to endure HD (hemodialysis) because the Home Renal Unit in Mackay wasn't going to open until after the new year and I was so ill that I couldn't go without treatment any longer.</p><p>The HD meant Chris and I had to drive into Mackay - a three hour drive, have dialysis (five hours) then turn around and drive the three hours home again.  We did this every two days for three months.  The sheer expense of it all was crippling.  I also had a reaction to the HD;  while my blood was being filtered by the machine, my blood pressure would skyrocket, resulting in a migraine-like headache.  Once the HD was done and I emptied my bladder, my blood pressure would return to normal.  There was nothing to be done about it, it was just an individual reaction my body had to the treatment.</p><p>Finally the week long training for managing my own PD came.  This was done in Mackay so we drove the kids up to Townsville to meet with family who took them to stay in Cairns, while Chris and I learnt everything about doing PD at home.  The PD I do involves four bag exchanges a day, 4-6 hours apart.  The last dwell is at around 11 pm and stays in my stomach until around 8.30 am.  I have had to do this every day for the last seven months no matter how shitty I feel or what else is going on.</p><p>Two weeks into my home PD, I received a call from my transplant co-ordinator/surgeon at the Westmead Hospital in Sydney. They wanted to see me to assess the possibility of a dual kidney and pancreas transplant!  I had been working towards this appointment for the past couple of months.  Many blood tests, scans, x-rays and reports from all of my specialists were needed to prove that I was a good candidate for transplant surgery.</p><p>For a long time I'd been drawing strength from the prospect of this appointment but in the days leading up to this, a dear friend of mine who also suffered from Type 1 diabetes slipped into a coma for the last time after a long and difficult battle.  He was the only person I could talk to and know that he truly understood what I was going through as he had dealt with and suffered through it all already.  When he passed, I felt guilty as I was going through the motions of receiving organs that could've saved his life.  I felt so torn because on one hand, I wanted to go and show my respects but on the other I felt the best way to honour him was to attend the appointment.  To have a chance at a normal life.  I'm sure that's what he would have wanted.</p><p>So I met with one of the surgeons and finalised all the paperwork.  They checked me inside and out and decided I was a suitable candidate for the transplant.  Words cannot describe how that felt.  I was on the transplant list!  I felt a mixture of excitement, fear and hope.  Hope for a brighter, healthier, more normal future for me and my family.  For the next three months everything went well.  I attended regular renal specialist and endocrinologist appointments with no problems, so we decided to treat the kids to a holiday in Cairns. It was wonderful! </p><p>The night before we headed home, I woke in the night with pains in my chest and had trouble breathing.  I dealt with it all night, thinking it was a bad case of heartburn but by morning it became unbearable and an ambulance was called.  My blood pressure was something like 240/160.  A whirlwind of scans followed.  My enzyme levels were checked and showed the presence of troponin, which meant I had in fact, suffered and survived a heart attack! </p><p>They watched my levels for a few days and sent me for a cardiogram, then an angiogram.  They attempted the first angiogram in my wrist but all my veins were too flimsy so they had to try again through my groin.  A narrowing of my circumflex artery was discovered and I was told I would need a stint put in my heart. This meant I would be removed from the active transplant list.  My glimmer of hope was gone.  I was devastated at being removed from the waiting list.</p><p>Initially, it was to be for twelve months but after speaking with my transplant team in Sydney and an adjustment in medication, it was changed to six months.  I continued with the medication following the stint operation and a stress test would then determine if I would then go back on the active transplant list. </p><p>A few weeks later I had to be flown out of Moranbah to Mackay where I was diagnosed with, and treated for pericarditis (fluid around the heart).  Yet another week was spent in hospital and yet again, Chris was there for me like he'd always been.  He and the kids spent hours driving back and forth to the hospital to be with me.  In the following weeks I had an angina attack and also lost my paternal grandmother, which was a whole other kind of pain.</p><p>On returning home from my grandmother's funeral down south, I was diagnosed with an extreme case of pneumonia and a collapsed lung with a remarkable amount of fluid around it.  To make it worse, I had a reaction to the pain medication and was unable to keep down any food or water.  The nausea was so terrible I couldn't even stomach smells or movement.  I lost eight kilograms in under a week! The opiate medication they then put me on virtually put me in a vegetative state but the nausea remained.  My only option was to go without the pain relief and just deal with the pain.</p><p>To remove the fluid from my lung, a tube had to be inserted through my back and allowed to drain out.  This process took two days.  Then x-rays were taken to ensure the lung had recovered sufficiently and no more fluid had accumulated. I was in hospital for eleven days before I happily went home.  While a bad cough remained, I eased back into routine and was feeling okay for the first time in a while.  But after two weeks, I felt the familiar swooshing sensation in my chest and knew I'd have to return to hospital...again.</p><p><br/> </p></div>","Hi.  I am Kathy's cousin.  The following is her story in her own words...My name is Kathy Abbott and I am a 29 year old mother of three beautiful children and wife to my amazing husband.  At the age of five I was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes.  My family and I managed my condition as best we could but when I was eight it was found that my diabetes had triggered epilepsy as well.  Thankfully, as I grew older, my medication and hormones changed and I grew out of the epilepsy at around thirteen.Meanwhile, from the time of my diagnosis, my life has been a constant shuffle of doctors, specialist appointments, highs and lows (especially in regards to my sugar levels) and learning the signs and triggers of hyper and hypo glycemic episodes (fits) which can lead to memory loss at one end of the scale and coma/death at the other.Because of my disease no part of my life was ever normal.  My mother was so concerned about my blood sugar levels it affected my ability to participate in school sports or have sleep-overs with friends.  I remember going to birthday parties and watching all the other kids eat lollies and race around like kids should, but I was just a bystander.  In my mid-teens, my ability or inability to have children was discussed.  I was told that it would be extremely hard for me to have or conceive children as it could lead to sporadic blood sugar levels and miscarriage.When I was 19 I met Chris, my now husband, through mutual friends.  I had never known anybody so intent on knowing as much as possible about my condition.  While his workmates would take their Playboy magazines to read on their lunch breaks, Chris would read up on medical books, leaflets and anything else he could source to help me manage my illness.  His support, understanding and desire to get me as healthy as possible and keep me there is what enabled us to conceive our first baby at the age of 21.We were in such a state of disbelief that we did several tests and even after the doctors confirmed it, we found it hard to believe.  Sadly, due to my unstable sugar levels, we miscarried in the first trimester. I can't put into words how that felt.  I felt like such a failure; we'd done our very best, but our very best brought us heartache like we'd never known.  Throughout all the appointments, tests, scripts, happiness and sadness, Chris was my rock and always there for me.  I kind of waited for him to just get tired of it all and leave but he never did.When we married in 2006, I didn't realise I was pregnant again.  I found out just before we suffered yet another loss.  After the third miscarriage, the emotional pain had taken its toll.  I couldn't handle any more disappointment and grief.  I decided the doctors were right - it was going to be next to impossible for us to have children and I was done.

A humanitarian effort to bring clean drinking water, sustainable energy and   building materials to communities around the world that so desperately need them.
                                      www.thehumanhandsproject.org
Your purchase of a DeviClear not only gives you pure drinking water but allows us to help those less fortunate in impoverished areas gain access to clean drinking water also – thanks to your generous participation.
                                               DeviClear
The DeviClear Purifier is the FIRST Portable (34oz) UV Purifier to use an integrated activated charcoal and pre-filter cap in one to purify and clean untreated water in 60 seconds.Not only does it contains a power button lock to prevent accidental use in your bag but it also enables you to charge via USB cable, Wall adapter and through the use of a Solar Panel which is one of the only methods of power you will be able to use if your electricity gets shut off in a disaster situation.With bottled water and potable tap water so readily available it is easy to take clean drinking water for granted.                                       But when natural disasters strike, one of the first things to sell out on the store shelves is bottled water.                                   Running water may even be turned off or compromised by pollutants.Now our bodies are made up of around 60% of water and so we understand how vital it is that the water is clean.                       Domestic water purifying pitches and faucet filters are fine for every day use, but most of them simply weren't designed to filter untreated water like the kind you may need to drink in emergency situations. Unlike those other off-the-shelf, refrigerator sized water filters DeviClear purifiers have actually been designed to purify the water from untreated sources like rain water, streams, dirty lake water and rivers.They use a much more powerful filtration system that removes harmful pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and unhealthy chemical contaminants such as chlorine. The DeviClear will also destroy the more resistant pathogens like Hepatitis, E.Coli, Salmonella, Legionella, and the Polio virus just to name a few. Your ordinary water purifying pitches and faucet filters                                                        were not designed to do this. The DeviClear Purifier can be a lifesaver in an emergency but it will also be a great product to use in your home on an everyday basis and a travel friendly water treatment option as an alternative to bottled.This is how it works:The DeviClear Purifier uses an activated charcoal filter along with a short wave germicidal UV light, plus a portable solar powered charging kit, making on the go water purification a breeze. We've made it very simple....First you unscrew the cap.Put in the filter.The Activated Carbon not only makes the water taste better but it also removes a lot of the impurities and contaminants including chlorine, odors, and pigments.Pour in the contaminated water.Screw on the Short Wave Germicidal UV Light cap and press the power button.           In about 60 seconds your water will be cleaned, purified and ready to drink.                                                                                It's as simple as that!Regardless of how clean water may look, any water source could be tainted with microscopic waterborne pathogens that, if ingested could cause severe diarrhea, cramps, vomiting and fever. This is why we have chosen to use an activated charcoal filter plus a short wave germicidal UV light as well. It will be twice as effective!Here's Why...
Activated Charcoal
Activated charcoal is a carbon that has been treated with oxygen. The treatment results in a highly porous charcoal. These tiny holes give the charcoal a surface area of 300 - 2,000 m2/g, allowing liquids or gases to pass through the charcoal and interact with the exposed carbon. The carbon adsorbs a wide range of impurities and contaminants, including chlorine, odors, and pigments.Short Wave Germicidal UV LightFrom research conducted through speaking with experts in the medical field and articles written on the subject, it is a known fact that the treatment of water with short wave germicidal UV light possesses by far the greatest germicidal effectiveness of all ultraviolet wavelengths. This exceeds U.S. EPA guide standards and protocols for destroying over 99.9999% of bacteria, 99.99% of viruses and 99.9% of protozoan cysts. The wavelength range is 2000 to 2950 (Angstrom units) which disrupts the DNA within the bacteria, virus and protozoa rendering them ineffective and, therefore, harmless. Using the sun's natural rays to clean water (Long-wave ultraviolet light) will have very little germicidal value as the wavelength range is 3250 to 3900 (Angstrom units).Using a Middle-wave ultraviolet light which is best known for its sun-tanning effect will provide some germicidal value but only with sufficient exposure.Short-wave ultraviolet light technology is the best proven method to use if you want to destroy all bacteria in the water, including the more resistant pathogens, Hepatitis, E.Coli,  Salmonella, Legionella, and the Polio virus.This is our start in the quest of eradicating world hunger and poverty. No more drinking filthy river or tap water, teeming with parasites, bacteria and animal waste.                                                     Water is a human right, not a commodity!  Donated DeviClear Purifiers will be sent to the places where it is needed the most. This includes: IndiaMost villages in India have inadequate water wells to service the people. Wells installed by the government are shallow in depth, and the water is not pure. As a result the people constantly battle afflictions with parasitic diseases.Africa (Ethiopia plus many other regions) Only 46% of Africans have access to adequate water for drinking and everyday purposes leaving millions of other African residents to suffer annually from diseases. Ethiopian woman and children often walk 6 hours to collect safe water, making school and housework a second priority. AsiaMuch of the arduous duty of fetching water falls on girls. The tasks are time consuming and very labourious. Woman and girls spend hours walking to the water sources, and their journeys often could be dangerous. When chained to such duties girls are excluded from going to school.PhilippinesTyphoon Haiyan left many in the Philippines without access to clean drinking water. Many are still in need of help.Haiti As the poorest nation in the wester hemisphere, Haiti has to deal with issues of poverty and water scarcity on a daily basis.

<h3>About Edwin</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<div>My name is Edwin Navarrete and I am a college soccer player from Escondido, California. Since college season was over I have been training consistently for my summer trials in the field and in the weight room.</div>
<div>I played for Santa Ana College where we finished 3 in State out of 322 college in California. My position is right back or defensive midfield. I was #5 in SAC in which I started every single match. Meeting some people there I was able to get a trial in August with  professional soccer teams in Mexico and El Salvador.</div> <p>This puts me in a difficult position, I need help funding my expenses to Mexico and El Salvador to be able to focus on my dream and what I have been working so long for of playing professional soccer.</p>
<p>With this funding campaign I hope to raise 2300 towards the cost of my trips to Mexico and El Salvador. Your help and believe in me to achieve my ultimate goal to play soccer in a different country is what I am hoping to obtain from this campaign.</p>
<p>Working farmers markets doesn't leave me with much to get to my destination. </p>
<p></p>
<p>My point is i'm pres-suing something and no one looks to happy about it?

About Edwin

My name is Edwin Navarrete and I am a college soccer player from Escondido, California. Since college season was over I have been training consistently for my summer trials in the field and in the weight room.
I played for Santa Ana College where we finished 3 in State out of 322 college in California. My position is right back or defensive midfield. I was #5 in SAC in which I started every single match. Meeting some people there I was able to get a trial in August with  professional soccer teams in Mexico and El Salvador. This puts me in a difficult position, I need help funding my expenses to Mexico and El Salvador to be able to focus on my dream and what I have been working so long for of playing professional soccer.
With this funding campaign I hope to raise 2300 towards the cost of my trips to Mexico and El Salvador. Your help and believe in me to achieve my ultimate goal to play soccer in a different country is what I am hoping to obtain from this campaign.
Working farmers markets doesn't leave me with much to get to my destination. 

My point is i'm pres-suing something and no one looks to happy about it? Because if your willing to go through all the battling you got to go through to get to where you want to get whose got the right to stop you? I mean maybe some of you guys got something you never finished something you really want to do something you never said to somebody something and your told no even after you paid your dues whose got the right to tell you that? who nobody!

As the hospitals that treat children and young people with cancer in Glasgow and Edinburgh are moving, CLIC Sargent urgently needs to raise around £3m so we can move our Homes from Home too, and continue to provide free accommodation to young cancer patients and their families close by.Pubs around Scotland are challenged to cycle 60 miles in one day, raising £5 per mile to help fund the new Homes from Home. Here's a little about what CLIC Sargent do:Each year around 300 children and young people are diagnosed with cancer in Scotland. During treatment, which can last up to three years, normal, everyday life is turned upside down.CLIC Sargent Homes from Home are vital for families who regularly travel large distances for their child to be treated for cancer. They provide free self-catering accommodation, just a short walk from the hospital, so that the family (parents or carers and siblings) can stay together at this difficult time. Our Homes from Home in Scotland are Cruachan House in Glasgow and CLIC Villa in Edinburgh.Please donate today, so that families dealing with cancer can stay together.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>BALLROOM BASIX BACKGROUND</h3>
<p>Headquartered in Harlem, the birthplace of swing and home to merengue &amp; salsa in ""El Barrio"" (Spanish Harlem), BALLROOM BASIX™ (BBX) has been heralded by educators, administrators and parents as a priceless contribution to the social &amp; emotional development of young teens as they begin to navigate the many challenges of adolescence. Founded in 2008 by championship dancer Sidney B. Grant, BALLROOM BA<strong>SIX</strong>™ (named for the SIX steps of the box step as well as the SIXth grade!) was developed and refined over a two-year period in two Harlem middle schools, culminating in the creation of NYC's only NON-COMPETITIVE partner dancing program—including merengue, tango, swing, foxtrot, rhumba, waltz, salsa, cha cha, and a country-western favorite that we dance to the kids' pop music: the barn dance! And although learning the dances is a skill in and of itself, our purpose and impact are far greater than the dances themselves.</p>
<p>Let's face it: Bullying is EPIDEMIC among today's young people, especially in middle school. ANYTHING we can do/support to deter bullying by transforming peer relations among classmates is worth contributing to! And since there are no ""teams"" involved, that means ALL children—regardless of appearance, ability, attitude, or popularity—get the chance to connect rotationally and respectfully with other students their age.</p>
<p>These critical socialization skills are further enhanced by our final BALLROOM BASIX BASH at the conclusion of classes. By bringing together two schools that do not know one another <u>without</u> competition, we enable children to ""MEET the other school, not BEAT the other school""—a much healthier culminating event than competition. The ""gentlemen"" from each school go over to the ""ladies"" from the other school and ask them for the dance, escorting them onto the dance circle to present the Ballroom &amp; Latin dances they've learned, to the amazement and appreciation of parents &amp; friends. Meeting a stranger is difficult at any age...and BALLROOM BASIX provides this life lesson in the context of a creative arts activity that improves self-confidence, poise and politeness.</p>
<p>Furthermore, considering how terribly device-addicted the kids are nowadays, getting them hand-in-hand, arm-in-arm and eye-to-eye is a real game changer in terms of how they relate to one another. And with all the alarming incidents of inappropriate behavior in schools among teens, what better way to instill a sense of physical respect among classmates as they dance from one student to the next?!? </p>
</div><div>
<h3>MORE Teaching Artists. MORE schools. MORE students!</h3>
<p>As more and more schools recognize the merits of our mission, the demand for our innovative arts-in-education initiative increases exponentially. That means the need for more teaching assistants who will be trained and groomed in order to become bonafide BBX Teaching Artists. </p>
<p>It also means coordinating with all the new schools contacting us that want to bring our ""fun, fitness &amp; fancy footwork"" to their students. Many of these schools, however, cannot afford even our modest tuition, so YOUR DONATION can directly support a school that cannot otherwise afford our BALLROOM BASIX™ programming. It also supports our ability to coordinate ongoing relationships with these school and their principals, vice principals and parent coordinators, so that BBX can become an integral part of their middle school culture.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The LIFE-CHANGING impact of BALLROOM BASIX</h3>
<p>These turbulent times have revealed just how sadly disconnected we are as a society. Connecting schoolchildren—rotationally and respectfully—with their classmate, can help heal the divisions they experience, personally and culturally, in their communities, many of whom are in under-served, inner-city environments. But don't take our word for it...read what one of our ""ladies"" from the Bronx wrote IN HER OWN WORDS:</p>

<p>On the ""foxtort"" front lines (and in the ""tango"" trenches), our Teaching Artists and their assistants require expert training and supervision to maintain the calibre of our creative curriculum.

""Game Changing Fin"" with Olympian Kaitlin Sandeno from Laguna Fin Co on Vimeo.
""As a breaststroker, I wish I had access to these fins while I was still competing- finally a fin you can use to train all of the four strokes. Every swimmer needs a pair of Laguna Fins in their equipment bag!"" - Kristy Kowal 2000 Olympic Silver Medalist (Breaststroke) “Laguna Fins is an amazing product I wish I had while I was training. They allow you to really feel the push and pull of the water, especially in breaststroke. Laguna Fins are a game changer for all swimmers but especially those that need to feel the water on the bottoms of their feet!”– Cammile Adams 2012 & 2016 Olympian TRAVEL Take Laguna Fins with you wherever you go! Our Competitive Fins have a combined weight of 1.4 lbs. The heel straps can be tucked inside the foot pocket and will take up minimum space inside your travel bag (10 x 6.5 x 2 inches). Our Youth Fins are even smaller, having a combined weight of <1 lb and can take up as little as 9 x 5.75 x 2 inches. Plus every pair of Laguna Fins comes in a small mesh bag which makes travel and hang-drying easier! ANKLE FLEXIBILITY Laguna Fins are open heeled, and are not restricted by rubber, allowing your ankles to move freely and maximize your full range of motion.

<p>We are an award-winning London based industrial design agency that brought you the Angle Razor in 2018. After raising £60,000 on Kickstarter the razor went on to win a D&amp;AD pencil and was shortlisted for Wallpaper* Magazine's grooming product of the year.</p>
<p>Now we want to complete the grooming experience with the beautiful Brush and Bowl.</p> <div data-id=""25103086""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/025/103/086/a93a12f47764c43d7354fa99c79bef67_original.gif?ixlib=rb-2.0.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1557600382&amp;auto=format&amp;frame=1&amp;q=92&amp;s=74daee0377626560bb958b976735820a"" src=""""/></figure></div>

<p>Most men will have experienced skin irritation from shaving at some point. It’s easy to rush a shave and skip out on the preparation, but this pre-shave step is the key to getting the best result from your shave.</p>
<div data-id=""24964532""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/024/964/532/5db57720a4d488f15d4d04b774d031be_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-2.0.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1556657231&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=4052927c5aaff4cddddbcb665042cfd5"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Brush</strong></p>
<p>Using a brush with plenty of warm water to apply your foam lather helps to soften the hair and raise it off the face. This helps you achieve a closer shave, reduce the risk of in-grown hairs and exfoliates your skin at the same time.</p>
<div data-id=""24964669""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/024/964/669/7cfabf07f69032ba3a1d6ce1958dc094_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-2.0.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1556657799&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=a01ebf3b00f27b58a00329b6afd58983"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>The Bowl</strong></h3>
<p>Having a high-sided bowl allows you to get a great thickness to your lather. This thickness lubricates the skin allowing the blade to glide over it without causing damage to the uppermost layer. Our bowl also acts as a cradle for the brush allowing it to drip dry after you've finished your shave.</p>
<p>While we advocate shaving with our Angle Razor, if you haven't got around to buying one yet and have a cartridge razor, you can still elevate your grooming regime with our Brush and Bowl - you'll still be doing both your facial hair and skin a huge favour... but while we're here, you can now get both the award winning Angle razor and the new Brush &amp; Bowl together in a special Kickstarter package, saving yourself 35% off the full retail price.</p> <div data-id=""25046769""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/025/046/769/efa4d17a13e5c322f024a5c821dcdd5e_original.png?ixlib=rb-2.0.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1557225569&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=7ec65921ff2451805cd4163c18c6058c"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p><strong>1. Cruelty free.</strong> We tested lots of brush knots until we found a synthetic option that performed like the traditional badger hair but is cruelty-free. Even better, our synthetic brush doesn't require softening in hot water like a traditional badger hair brush; it’s super soft from the first use.</p>

Built to last.</strong> The brush handle and bowl are both made from anodised aluminium making them resistant to soapy water and wet bathroom environments and tough enough to last a lifetime.</p>

<p>Whilst canned shaving foam produces a great foam, we all know how bad aerosol cans are for the environment. On average bar shaving soap lasts for over seven times as long as the cans and are free from all those nasty chemicals.</p>
<p>Whilst it's obviously a little more work to work up the lather yourself rather than squirt it straight from a can, we've designed our hand held Bowl to make this as least amount of effort as possible. Taking the time to work the lather into your skin with our Brush will exfoliate it, soften the hair and reduce the chance of shaving irritation.</p>
<p>Order your Brush and Bowl at our Kickstarter rate and make a conscious effort to reduce waste and look good doing it.</p>

The Angle Razor, Brush and Bowl complete kit.





 
We are an award-winning London based industrial design agency that brought you the Angle Razor in 2018. After raising £60,000 on Kickstarter the razor went on to win a D&AD pencil and was shortlisted for Wallpaper* Magazine's grooming product of the year.
Now we want to complete the grooming experience with the beautiful Brush and Bowl. 

Most men will have experienced skin irritation from shaving at some point. It’s easy to rush a shave and skip out on the preparation, but this pre-shave step is the key to getting the best result from your shave.

 
The Brush
Using a brush with plenty of warm water to apply your foam lather helps to soften the hair and raise it off the face. This helps you achieve a closer shave, reduce the risk of in-grown hairs and exfoliates your skin at the same time.

 
The Bowl
Having a high-sided bowl allows you to get a great thickness to your lather. This thickness lubricates the skin allowing the blade to glide over it without causing damage to the uppermost layer. Our bowl also acts as a cradle for the brush allowing it to drip dry after you've finished your shave.
While we advocate shaving with our Angle Razor, if you haven't got around to buying one yet and have a cartridge razor, you can still elevate your grooming regime with our Brush and Bowl - you'll still be doing both your facial hair and skin a huge favour... but while we're here, you can now get both the award winning Angle razor and the new Brush & Bowl together in a special Kickstarter package, saving yourself 35% off the full retail price. 
1. Cruelty free. We tested lots of brush knots until we found a synthetic option that performed like the traditional badger hair but is cruelty-free. Even better, our synthetic brush doesn't require softening in hot water like a traditional badger hair brush; it’s super soft from the first use.
 2. Built to last. The brush handle and bowl are both made from anodised aluminium making them resistant to soapy water and wet bathroom environments and tough enough to last a lifetime.
 3. More hygienic. The arm of the bowl acts as a cradle for the brush allowing it to dry properly after each use therefore reducing the build up of bacteria.
 4. Ergonomic design. Not only does the brush balance perfectly on the bowl, the weight and shape of both tools have been considered for how they fit in the hand, with the high sides to the bowl giving you the ability to whip up a foam lather without it spilling over the sides.  5. Better for the environment. Using a brush and bowl allows you to use more affordable and more sustainable bar soaps and achieve the same results as expensive foams.
 
Whilst canned shaving foam produces a great foam, we all know how bad aerosol cans are for the environment. On average bar shaving soap lasts for over seven times as long as the cans and are free from all those nasty chemicals.
Whilst it's obviously a little more work to work up the lather yourself rather than squirt it straight from a can, we've designed our hand held Bowl to make this as least amount of effort as possible. Taking the time to work the lather into your skin with our Brush will exfoliate it, soften the hair and reduce the chance of shaving irritation.
Order your Brush and Bowl at our Kickstarter rate and make a conscious effort to reduce waste and look good doing it.




 The Angle Razor is a machined aluminium straight razor that takes almost any disposable razor blade. It's been designed to be easy to control and to clean, to feel perfectly balanced in the hand and to give an incredibly precise shave using a single blade.
After being 383% funded on Kickstarter last year, we've been amazed by how well our Angle Razor has been received since launched. Now stocked in stores across the globe, we are giving you an exclusive opportunity to purchase one at a reduced price if you pledge for a Brush and Bowl today. 


The Angle Razor has been improved since the initial launch in 2018 based on customer feedback. A tighter shaving angle with increased blade visibility gives an even closer shave and we’ve improved the way the magnet holds the blade whilst you are loading it.

 
We are launching this updated version simultaneously with the launch of the Brush and Bowl so this is your opportunity to get your hands on the new and improved Angle Razor before anyone else.


The Angle Razor, Brush and Bowl complete kit.









After the success of the Angle Razor we knew that the Brush and Bowl had a lot to live up to. Starting out as a stand alone brush, we spent months finding the perfect size and weight balance and debating between a badger or synthetic brush knot.

During on-going testing of the brush, we realised that the brush needed a stand to ensure it dried properly after use and that a shaving bowl would really complete the experience. At Morrama we find beauty in simplicity and so we created a shaving bowl that both cradles and displays the brush.


If you'd like to support the Angle by Morrama campaign in style then why not grab yourself a flash sheet of design-inspired temporary tattoos, illustrated by hand and printed on skin-safe, non-toxic transfer paper.

<p>Only 1/3 kids are getting the recommended daily amount of physical activity and only 5% of adults. Teens are spending more than 7.5 hours a day in front of a screen rather than participating in some form of physical activity. Adults have higher risk of stroke, heart failure, stress, depression, and cancer than if they got only 30 minutes of physical activity everyday.</p>
<p>Being active doesn't mean getting up at 6am to go for a run. It can be as simple as walking your dog, taking the stairs, or parking farther away! </p>
<p>Hi, this is Micheal, one of the co-founders of Run for Stuff. </p>
<p>So one year ago I was going for a run with my girlfriend and she said to me, <br/>""Wouldn't it be sweet if we ran to booster juice and they gave us a free juice for running?"".<br/>Right at that moment I realized the potential of a simple reward and how it could encourage physical activity. </p>
<p>As soon as I got home I purchased the domain name runforstuff.com for $14.99 </p>
<p>Since that day we got to work. Today we have a team of 5, and we all attend Macewan University in Edmonton, AB. Our office headquarters is located in Startup Edmonton, right across the street from Rogers Place. </p>
<p><strong>So what is Run for Stuff? </strong></p>
<p>We created Run for Stuff to be a reward platform that encourages people to be active by giving awesome exclusive discounts on fitness apparel products. Our mission is to encourage 1 million people to become more physically active by 2019, and save people over 50 million dollars. We provide a way for fitness companies to give back to their customers in a unique way that further motivates and encourages people to live a healthy and active lifestyle. Imagine, you walk everyday, why not get rewarded for it? </p>
<p>Run for Stuff is more than a fitness app, it is FUN!</p>
<p>With Run for Stuff the more you are active through walking or running, the more you get. Browse products that are offered on sweet rewards, and redeem those products with the points you earned. </p>
<p>Furthermore, if you see a product from a company that you love, but it is not offered on reward, you can select to get notified when it is, so that you can always keep yourself motivated just in case! </p>
<p>Run for Stuff truly makes running, and shopping, into a game! </p>

<p><strong>What We Need </strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>To be frank, we need money to expand our team and create more events that can get people active. </p>
<p>Our goals for the summer is to promote physical activity through putting on more and more events that lets people be active in fun ways. Things like capture the flag, dodgeball, tag, baseball, soccer, etc. Furthermore, we want to help underprivileged kids get access to organized sports, and supply them with the equipment needed. We strongly believe in helping our community and supporting those who need the help. However, we are funding ourselves on very limited resources. </p>
<p>We currently have a team of 5 working on Run for Stuff.  Everyone on the team is working for sweat equity, and putting everything we have into this, but to be more sustainable and earn the trust of companies that want to back us we need to have full time employees. As well, the funding would be used for marketing expenses. As a socially responsible company we want to back anything to do with health and physical activity such as: </p>
<ul>

</div><p>And that's all there is to it.</p><p> </p><p> </p></div>","Only 1/3 kids are getting the recommended daily amount of physical activity and only 5% of adults. Teens are spending more than 7.5 hours a day in front of a screen rather than participating in some form of physical activity. Adults have higher risk of stroke, heart failure, stress, depression, and cancer than if they got only 30 minutes of physical activity everyday.
Being active doesn't mean getting up at 6am to go for a run. It can be as simple as walking your dog, taking the stairs, or parking farther away! 
Hi, this is Micheal, one of the co-founders of Run for Stuff. 
So one year ago I was going for a run with my girlfriend and she said to me, ""Wouldn't it be sweet if we ran to booster juice and they gave us a free juice for running?"".Right at that moment I realized the potential of a simple reward and how it could encourage physical activity. 
As soon as I got home I purchased the domain name runforstuff.com for $14.99 
Since that day we got to work. Today we have a team of 5, and we all attend Macewan University in Edmonton, AB. Our office headquarters is located in Startup Edmonton, right across the street from Rogers Place. 
So what is Run for Stuff? 
We created Run for Stuff to be a reward platform that encourages people to be active by giving awesome exclusive discounts on fitness apparel products. Our mission is to encourage 1 million people to become more physically active by 2019, and save people over 50 million dollars. We provide a way for fitness companies to give back to their customers in a unique way that further motivates and encourages people to live a healthy and active lifestyle. Imagine, you walk everyday, why not get rewarded for it? 
Run for Stuff is more than a fitness app, it is FUN!
With Run for Stuff the more you are active through walking or running, the more you get. Browse products that are offered on sweet rewards, and redeem those products with the points you earned. 
Furthermore, if you see a product from a company that you love, but it is not offered on reward, you can select to get notified when it is, so that you can always keep yourself motivated just in case! 
Run for Stuff truly makes running, and shopping, into a game! 

What We Need 

To be frank, we need money to expand our team and create more events that can get people active. 
Our goals for the summer is to promote physical activity through putting on more and more events that lets people be active in fun ways. Things like capture the flag, dodgeball, tag, baseball, soccer, etc. Furthermore, we want to help underprivileged kids get access to organized sports, and supply them with the equipment needed. We strongly believe in helping our community and supporting those who need the help. However, we are funding ourselves on very limited resources. 
We currently have a team of 5 working on Run for Stuff.  Everyone on the team is working for sweat equity, and putting everything we have into this, but to be more sustainable and earn the trust of companies that want to back us we need to have full time employees. As well, the funding would be used for marketing expenses. As a socially responsible company we want to back anything to do with health and physical activity such as: 

Sponsoring running events
Creating/Sponsoring initiates to get kids and adults active
Donating to charities such as Stollery Children Hospital, Stand up to Cancer, Heart and Stroke Foundation, etc. 

The money you provide will be going towards a cause to help people live healthier lives

<p>Perfect practice makes perfect. DuoTrac doesn’t slap a Band-Aid on a player’s bad swing habits, it helps cure it. It’ll break the vicious cycle of practicing the wrong habits by supplying metrics at each key position of the swing to keep you square, as well as coaching tips to correct your position. Doing so will help create awareness around swing consistency and bring attention to errors in a swing before practiced and conditioned with the wrong techniques. With DuoTrac, a golfer can immediately identify weak points in advance, subsequently reducing wasteful training.</p>

<p><b>SHORT SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>I love my Mom, Laurie Squires Bovee. She is an award-winning rose gardener, with many medals and trophies to
vouch for her mastery. Unfortunately…life
has been extremely hard on my Mom. She needed hip replacement surgery a few
years ago, which almost killed her when the chromium and cobalt hip implant
they put in her began shaving heavy metal into her bloodstream. The
device was later recalled by the manufacturer, which led her back into the
operating room for a second hip replacement surgery, but the damage had already
been done. She has just been diagnosed with breast cancer. Those of us who love
her will do what we can to inspire and empower her recovery. This is the
motivation behind project Blossoms and Blessings. Cultivating beautiful rose
gardens brings my Mom joy and keeps her active and outside. It connects her
with the vital energy of Nature. We all die one day, but I want more than
anything to help my Mom live every moment she has left to the fullest. Every act of compassion is significant, so let's start with something small - a rose garden for The Rose Lady. Flowers grown in this garden will be donated to cancer patients in local hospitals.</p>

<br/><p></p>
<p><b>WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET:</b></p>
<p>We need loving prayers backed by actions and energized by
faith. We need the power of God flowing through the lives of people. We need
seeds of compassion sown in order to cultivate them into blossoms and blessings.
You get to sow seeds of compassion, which are eternal. You will live forever in
our hearts. 25 of you have the opportunity to dedicate a rose to a loved one. You also get beautiful breast-cancer awareness accessories which
are extremely useful in certain circumstances. Finally, you get the
opportunity to meet and spend a little time with one of the coolest people in
human history, the Rose Lady, Laurie Squires Bovee.</p>

<p>By contributing to Blossoms and Blessings you are not only helping a great woman in her hour of greatest need; you are also contributing to raising awareness of the health issues which have brought her and our family so much pain. Cancer is sweeping through our civilization like a plague. If there is one thing I know about my Mom it is she can find joy and strength under any circumstance. The joy of the Lord is her strength, and she can do all things in Christ which strengthens her. We are striving together to educate and empower ourselves against this plague, and we will be sharing the fruits of this labor with you. We will also be sharing the roses grown in this garden with cancer patients in local hospitals. We are fighters. Stand with us!</p>

been done. She has just been diagnosed with breast cancer. Those of us who love
her will do what we can to inspire and empower her recovery. This is the
motivation behind project Blossoms and Blessings. Cultivating beautiful rose
gardens brings my Mom joy and keeps her active and outside. It connects her
with the vital energy of Nature. We all die one day, but I want more than
anything to help my Mom live every moment she has left to the fullest. Every act of compassion is significant, so let's start with something small - a rose garden for The Rose Lady. Flowers grown in this garden will be donated to cancer patients in local hospitals.






WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET:
We need loving prayers backed by actions and energized by
faith. We need the power of God flowing through the lives of people. We need
seeds of compassion sown in order to cultivate them into blossoms and blessings.
You get to sow seeds of compassion, which are eternal. You will live forever in
our hearts. 25 of you have the opportunity to dedicate a rose to a loved one. You also get beautiful breast-cancer awareness accessories which
are extremely useful in certain circumstances. Finally, you get the
opportunity to meet and spend a little time with one of the coolest people in
human history, the Rose Lady, Laurie Squires Bovee.










IMPACT:

By contributing to Blossoms and Blessings you are not only helping a great woman in her hour of greatest need; you are also contributing to raising awareness of the health issues which have brought her and our family so much pain. Cancer is sweeping through our civilization like a plague. If there is one thing I know about my Mom it is she can find joy and strength under any circumstance. The joy of the Lord is her strength, and she can do all things in Christ which strengthens her. We are striving together to educate and empower ourselves against this plague, and we will be sharing the fruits of this labor with you. We will also be sharing the roses grown in this garden with cancer patients in local hospitals. We are fighters. Stand with us!

To increase healthcare access, our program organizes brigades in a mobile-clinic type fashion with the help of community leaders and volunteers. Medical Brigades works in many communities that eventually will or have started to become Holistic Communities, complete with projects from all of our other programs. We visit each community on average, every 4-6 months. During the time leading up to each brigade, the in-country team conducts a community visit as well. This visit consists of a meeting with community leaders and volunteers, in order to both prepare them for the upcoming brigade and simultaneously outline their contribution to the brigade. Community contributions range from gathering volunteers to assist with the brigade, identifying and preparing clean and private workspaces for doctors, raising awareness about the upcoming brigade, etc.  <br/><br/>     Depending on volunteer numbers, weather and brigade seasons, the Medical team implements medical care via three-day brigades in each community at least twice per year. The brigade offers comprehensive, on-site care, including triage, general consultation, gynecology, dental care, an educational health presentation for children and adults, and a pharmacy. Each patient will leave the brigade with a complete consultation, illness prevention education, and appropriate medicine, for both current problems presented during consultation and for prevention of common health problems in the community.

Outside of normal brigades, Medical Brigades works with the Community Health Workers (CHW) Program to train community-selected leaders in how to provide basic medical care and monitor chronic conditions. The Community Health Workers play a vital role in the Global Brigades sustainability model. Since many of the illnesses seen at our mobile clinics are preventable (intestinal parasites, dehydration, etc.) communities benefit greatly from trained CHWs working to educate residents on preventative action, and notify patients if and when their conditions require medical attention.

<p><span>The pump track--a modular, all weather, prefabricated riding structure that allows riders to propel about anything with wheels around it using the force of gravity—has been approved by the Corvallis Parks, Natural Area and Recreation Advisory Board.<span>  </span>This type of track would be the first of its kind in Oregon!</span></p>
<p>The proposed Corvallis pump track is ideal for families and children that love to bike, skate or scooter. <span>With childhood obesity and screen time on the rise, the pump track provides a healthy, outdoor activity for children. </span>We also believe that a pump track is a perfect fit for Corvallis's family friendly community.<span> </span></p>

<p>We are and have been working closely with Corvallis Parks and Recreation Department for several years to get us to this point. Timing of installation is dependent on how quickly funds are raised, the location is finalized and the vendor can ship us the track.

The pump track--a modular, all weather, prefabricated riding structure that allows riders to propel about anything with wheels around it using the force of gravity—has been approved by the Corvallis Parks, Natural Area and Recreation Advisory Board.  This type of track would be the first of its kind in Oregon!
The proposed Corvallis pump track is ideal for families and children that love to bike, skate or scooter. With childhood obesity and screen time on the rise, the pump track provides a healthy, outdoor activity for children. We also believe that a pump track is a perfect fit for Corvallis's family friendly community. 
Please join us in providing safe, fun, outdoor activities for our children.  Together, let's encourage our community to ""Log Off"" and ""Ride On!""

Well, here is your chance! We're offering an opportunity, not just to get to a better bedpan, but also for you to help improve the quality of life for all the nurses, caregivers, and patients who deal with bedpans every day.100% of the funds raised will go towards fulfilling orders and marketing so that we can get the Bedderpan™ into the hands of those who need a better bedpan. And, for anyone who wants to donate Bedderpans directly to care facilities, we're offering the special Bedderpan Benefactor perk to directly improve the quality of life for everyone there.We also recognize that the Bedderpan is a kind of product that people may need immediately rather than waiting a couple of months. This is why, unlike most other crowdfunding campaigns at launch, any perk with a full-sized Bedderpan will be shipped no later than the next day after receiving the order (unless USPS is closed the next day and as long as supplies last). The Bedderpan is a simple, but better bedpan that improves patient and caregiver quality of life by adding comfort and reducing spillage.  For any unaware, bedpans are used to collect bodily waste for those physically unable to get out of bed. Because 1 in 7 adults experience a disability that limits their mobility and independence, millions of people must use bedpans every day.But, current bedpans are far from perfect. They have many issues that frustrate nurses and patients everywhere: they exacerbate discomfort, they spill excessively, and amplify dependency. These are not things that patients and nurses should be worried about.   Nurses and patients alike know all too well the difficulties regarding spillage, discomfort, and dependency, and, in fact, many prefer not using any bedpan altogether. Each time a bedpan spills, it takes an additional 15 minutes to clean up. We estimate that due to bedpan spillage, over 24 million hours are wasted in hospitals across the US – every year. Not to mention the millions more in homes like yours and mine.  Imagine if all this time could be utilized for other important responsibilities or even for nurses and caregivers to take better care of themselves, like actually having the time to eat lunch. As the only product designed using another bedpan as a supplement, the Bedderpan is able to both improve comfort and reduce the chance of spillage. A truly better bedpan.To address many of the issues of bedpans, the Bedderpan offers a wide seating area, a sturdy frame, and a low profile. These together create a bedpan that is more comfortable, more stable, and easier to position under patients. The front opening addresses the largest concern of all: spillage. By facilitating taking out waste, bedpan removal is a cinch. With a more ergonomic and effective design, the Bedderpan offers numerous benefits over current bedpans: saving time and money, increasing satisfaction for both patients and nurses, and promoting less skin irritation, allowing for less spillage for bacterial growth, and causing less bedsores. The Bedderpan is used very similarly to current bedpans. The main difference is the removal, where the fracture pan can be removed separately to get rid of waste quickly, and effectively.    The Bedderpan is made and manufactured in the USA, and offers a high standing strength with a light-weight, recyclable material.Without a fracture pan, the Bedderpan is sized at 9.8""x11.7""x3.3"".With a fracture pan, the combination is 12.6""x11.7""x3.4"" to the handle. The Bedderpan is strong enough to support the full standing weight of an average man without deforming. We recognize that because some people need the Bedderpan now, rather than in a month or two, any full-sized Bedderpan order will be processed no later than the next day after backing our campaign! Fulfilled with free 2-3 day shipping for US locations.

</div></div>","Do you know that 40 percent of the estimated 125 to 160 billion pounds of food goes to waste every year in the United States? What a distressing number.

Packaging and storage issues are the main cause of most food waste. Why not add a food vacuum sealer to your home kitchen to keep food fresh and lock in taste? It is already helping millions of families to reduce food waste and enjoy a healthier, modern lifestyle.  So, meet FRESKO V8 - World’s First Intelligent 5 in 1 Food Vacuum Sealer, your new mate in the kitchen. Affordable and reliable, supports universal vacuum bags/vacuum boxes and wine bottles. Store the food in a simple way, and save money right away. 
 
 
Made by Unbox Fantasy, a professional crew assemblage from the former editors of tech review media.

Check out the new unboxing & hands-on made by Pick Gadgets.

Our mission is food saving and making smart food storage more accessible to everyone. We are dedicated to providing absolute vacuum that ensures your food stays fresher, longer.

To demonstrate the benefits of vacuum sealing, we conducted a long-term experiment using two servings of the same food. One was placed in a standard plastic bag while the other one was vacuum sealed by FRESKO V8. The results speak for themselves. 
Universal Vacuum Bags Compatible 
FRESKO V8 is compatible with most types of vacuum bags on the market. Keep food in the vacuum bag, retain the freshness, and save space in your refrigerator.
 
External Vacuum Capable 
FRESKO V8 is compatible with all types of vacuum seal food containers on the market. Use its external vacuum attachment to remove the air from the container before storage. Your food stays fresh and tastes great longer! 
 
Prevent Wines From Oxidizing 
FRESKO can even keep the wine fresh and drinkable for a long time. By reducing the oxygen remaining in the bottle after it has been opened, allows it to stay fresh and delicious for an extra 7-14 days.

 
Dry Food Vac-Seal Supported 
Use FRESKO V8 to vac-seal dry foods, like nuts and coffee. It keeps moisture away and lets you keep them 5x longer. Your afternoon tea and snacks will taste better than ever.
 

 
Moist  Food Vac-Seal Supported 
Use FRESKO V8 to vac-seal moist foods, like beef and vegetables. Lock in the freshness and even cook in the bag for delicious Sous Vide recipes. 

 
For Professional Cooking 
FRESKO V8's moist mode is really a perfect way to marinate your food, and it is the first step in sous vide cooking. Instead of using a microwave, you can boil your vac-sealed food. It reheats your food without getting it too mushy or drying it out.
 
For Daily Cooking 
FRESKO V8 is the most convenient method of daily cooking. The next time you watch a cooking video on YouTube, you will have all the fresh ingredients that you need, ready to go!
 
Vacuum Sealing Made Easy
The biggest problem with ordinary vacuum sealers is that they are too labor-intensive! Too many useless steps slow down the process and waste time. 

 
One-Touch To Lock In Freshness 
FRESKO V8 eliminates the multiple manual operations necessary with typical vacuum sealing devices. It makes food storage fast and easy and only requires 5 seconds between continuous sealing jobs, much faster than previous vacuum sealers. 
 
We Make Food Vacuum Fun 
The entire process can be completed in three simple steps: Insert the bag, press the button, and FRESKO will do the rest. Intelligent one-touch vac-seal offers true convenience, true automation, and true ease of use.

Luminous LED Ring 
FRESKO V8 is designed based on human-computer interaction science. After extensive research about the way in which people work in the kitchen, we make FRESKO V8 more user friendly. The unique luminous LED ring will give you a clear sign of cold and hot, or when it is done. It’s as intuitive as setting your AC. 

 
Exquisite Design 
FRESKO V8 has a streamlined structure design and exquisite color that fits perfectly into contemporary design aesthetics and is complementary to other modern appliances. It’s perfect for all kitchens. 

 
Magnetic Drip Tray Design
When you are finished,  FRESKO V8's bottom drip tray is easy to clean. The magnetic design ensures no water leakage and allows easy removal and installation.

We started the design of FRESKO V8 in November 2019, and we built the first demo prototype four months later. For the next five months, we repeated sample preparation and testing. We documented our progress with pictures and hope that our efforts can earn your support to help us launch FRESKO V8 to the world through Kickstarter.We’ll be adding new FAQs as we go along, and we’ll be keeping you up to date with Kickstarter Updates, messages, and via the Comment wall.

<h3><img alt=""Passion Inspired by a father's cancer; support daughter's mission to give back and be part of the safe skincare revolution!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cincovidas.com/indiegogo/maintitle.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cincovidas.com/indiegogo/CF%20showcase.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Why is this campaign so important to us"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cincovidas.com/indiegogo/banner_why.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Because I know you’ve been there, too, where someone you cared about suffered from irritating, painful and devastating </span><span class=""s1"">skin conditions.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">You may have watched them struggle to find safe, effective and natural solutions that didn’t further irritate the skin or add potentially dangerous toxins to it.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">My father went through this struggle when he suffered a debilitating rash during his cancer treatments, and a high-end cream supposedly for “sensitive skin” burned him even further.  I researched what was in the product and learned it was full of potentially harmful chemicals, some even linked to cancer. I was shocked! </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Studies have shown that standard ingredients in the global skincare market have been linked with irritation, dryness, and dullness, as well as more serious concerns like hormone disruption and even cancer.</strong> Yet most companies persist in using these questionable ingredients because they’re cheap and readily available. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cincovidas.com/indiegogo/CF%20showcase2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">When will this stop? <strong>Enough is enough.</strong> We need to put an end to this, and we need your help.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">To honor my father’s legacy, I created CV Skinlabs skincare. This line is 100% free of ingredients tied to cancer, hormone disruption and other health issues, and has been clinically proven  to help repair sensitive skins.   </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">My vision is to create a safe skincare revolution to deliver non-toxic, clean and effective skincare to those who need it most. This campaign is an effort to help me accomplish just that.  <br/></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">With your support, we’ll be using every dollar raised in this campaign to accomplish two key objectives:</span></strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3><img alt=""Objective 1"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cincovidas.com/indiegogo/banner_objective1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Deliver a sampling of all <strong>CV Skinlabs products to every hospital in the nation,</strong> so those who need them most will have access to them. </span></p>
<ul>
<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1"">Research additional solutions and product possibilities to help everyone with fragile and sensitive skin enjoy safe solutions that help repair and restore skin’s natural radiance and health.</span></li>
<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1"">Maintain communication with our customers and contributors to incorporate valuable feedback into our brand, products, and message.</span></li>
<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1"">Support like-minded organizations that are pressuring big corporations to change their formulations to be safer for human bodies.</span></li>
</ul>

<h3><img alt=""Objective 2"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cincovidas.com/indiegogo/banner_objective2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Start a <strong>marketing campaign to get CV Skinlabs into cancer centers nationwide</strong>, where sensitive skin conditions are common, and people deserve relief.</span><span class=""s2"">  </span></p>
<ul>
<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1"">Educate patients about what products to use in their daily lives and which to avoid—through presentations, lectures, online information sources, and Britta’s book, When Cancer Hits.</span></li>
<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1"">Extend our educational outreach to create more awareness about the damage chemicals can do in our bodies, our lives, and our world.</span></li>
<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1"">Expand the brand across the nation to these centers and eventually, globally.</span></li>

<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Have you ever lost someone who was extremely important to you? </span></strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">If so, you know what a hole it leaves in your heart—and how strong is the drive to honor that person’s life in a meaningful and lasting way. </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">That’s how makeup artist and natural beauty expert, Britta Aragon, felt when she lost her father in 2007 after his eight-year battle with cancer. A survivor herself, she had Hodgkin’s lymphoma when she was only 16 years old, but after undergoing chemo treatments, she emerged cancer-free.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Her father would not be so lucky. The courage and fortitude he showed battling five recurrences, however, inspired many around him, most of all, his daughter. When he was gone, Britta wanted more than anything to find a way to honor his spirit.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""> </p>

<h3><img alt=""Help for a difficult side effect"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cincovidas.com/indiegogo/banner_help.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">One of the main issues both Britta and her father suffered while going through cancer treatments was super sensitive, fragile skin. <strong>Britta’s father, especially, endured burning, inflamed, and rash-like symptoms that wouldn’t respond to conventional skincare products.</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cincovidas.com/indiegogo/personal.png"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin-right: 20px;""/></span></p>
<p class=""p1""> </p>
<p class=""p1"">Even when Britta used her makeup artist expertise to buy him a high-end cream—supposedly for sensitive skin—it ended up burning and irritating his skin even further. <strong>She researched the ingredients and was shocked to find irritating synthetics linked to cancer and hormone disruption!</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">She immediately set about finding a better alternative. That turned out to be a treasured piece of a neighbor’s aloe plant. Unlike the expensive cream, this simple plant soothed and cooled her father’s skin immediately. Britta knew she was on to something.</p>
<h3><img alt=""Founding a new line of safe, nourishing skin care"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cincovidas.com/indiegogo/banner_safe.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">“When my father passed away,” Britta said, “I wanted to help others like him who, for whatever reason, couldn’t tolerate the average, chemical-laden products on the market today. I also realized, through my research, that the high levels of chemicals in our products and in the environment were having an adverse effect on our health, so it became extremely important to me that whatever I did would help lessen that toxic load.”</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">To that end, Britta, did two things:</span></p>
<ol class=""ol1"">
<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1""><strong>founded the Cinco Vidas blog</strong>—“cinco vidas” means “five lives” in Spanish, in honor of the five times her father renewed his commitment to life. <br/></span></li>
<li class=""li1"">She wrote <strong><em>When Cancer Hits</em>,</strong> the guide she wished she had when she was caring for her father. <span class=""s1""><br/></span>
</li>
<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1"">and <strong>created CV Skinlabs,</strong> a new skin care line that would set a new standard of safety, while effectively repairing and nourish sensitive skin back to radiant health.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class=""li1""><span class=""s1""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cincovidas.com/indiegogo/Britta_FBFinal%201.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">“I learned that applying the right combinations of bio-compatible ingredients was critical to restoring and healing the skin without irritation,” Britta says. <strong>She had every single ingredient toxicologically reviewed before clearing it for use in her formulas, to ensure each one had a 100% clean assessment.</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">“This was the only way I could make sure that my formulas were truly safe, while clinical testing ensured the formulas worked,” she said.</span></p>
<h3 class=""p1""><span class=""s3""><strong><img alt=""Our rewards for your contributions"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cincovidas.com/indiegogo/banner_contributing.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></span></h3>

</div></div>","Because I know you’ve been there, too, where someone you cared about suffered from irritating, painful and devastating skin conditions.
You may have watched them struggle to find safe, effective and natural solutions that didn’t further irritate the skin or add potentially dangerous toxins to it.
My father went through this struggle when he suffered a debilitating rash during his cancer treatments, and a high-end cream supposedly for “sensitive skin” burned him even further.  I researched what was in the product and learned it was full of potentially harmful chemicals, some even linked to cancer. I was shocked! 
Studies have shown that standard ingredients in the global skincare market have been linked with irritation, dryness, and dullness, as well as more serious concerns like hormone disruption and even cancer. Yet most companies persist in using these questionable ingredients because they’re cheap and readily available. 

When will this stop? Enough is enough. We need to put an end to this, and we need your help.
To honor my father’s legacy, I created CV Skinlabs skincare. This line is 100% free of ingredients tied to cancer, hormone disruption and other health issues, and has been clinically proven  to help repair sensitive skins.   
My vision is to create a safe skincare revolution to deliver non-toxic, clean and effective skincare to those who need it most. This campaign is an effort to help me accomplish just that.  
With your support, we’ll be using every dollar raised in this campaign to accomplish two key objectives:



Deliver a sampling of all CV Skinlabs products to every hospital in the nation, so those who need them most will have access to them. 

Research additional solutions and product possibilities to help everyone with fragile and sensitive skin enjoy safe solutions that help repair and restore skin’s natural radiance and health.
Maintain communication with our customers and contributors to incorporate valuable feedback into our brand, products, and message.
Support like-minded organizations that are pressuring big corporations to change their formulations to be safer for human bodies.




Start a marketing campaign to get CV Skinlabs into cancer centers nationwide, where sensitive skin conditions are common, and people deserve relief.  

Educate patients about what products to use in their daily lives and which to avoid—through presentations, lectures, online information sources, and Britta’s book, When Cancer Hits.
Extend our educational outreach to create more awareness about the damage chemicals can do in our bodies, our lives, and our world.
Expand the brand across the nation to these centers and eventually, globally.






Have you ever lost someone who was extremely important to you? 
If so, you know what a hole it leaves in your heart—and how strong is the drive to honor that person’s life in a meaningful and lasting way. 
That’s how makeup artist and natural beauty expert, Britta Aragon, felt when she lost her father in 2007 after his eight-year battle with cancer. A survivor herself, she had Hodgkin’s lymphoma when she was only 16 years old, but after undergoing chemo treatments, she emerged cancer-free.
Her father would not be so lucky. The courage and fortitude he showed battling five recurrences, however, inspired many around him, most of all, his daughter. When he was gone, Britta wanted more than anything to find a way to honor his spirit.
 
 

 

One of the main issues both Britta and her father suffered while going through cancer treatments was super sensitive, fragile skin. Britta’s father, especially, endured burning, inflamed, and rash-like symptoms that wouldn’t respond to conventional skincare products.

 
Even when Britta used her makeup artist expertise to buy him a high-end cream—supposedly for sensitive skin—it ended up burning and irritating his skin even further. She researched the ingredients and was shocked to find irritating synthetics linked to cancer and hormone disruption!
She immediately set about finding a better alternative. That turned out to be a treasured piece of a neighbor’s aloe plant. Unlike the expensive cream, this simple plant soothed and cooled her father’s skin immediately. Britta knew she was on to something.

“When my father passed away,” Britta said, “I wanted to help others like him who, for whatever reason, couldn’t tolerate the average, chemical-laden products on the market today. I also realized, through my research, that the high levels of chemicals in our products and in the environment were having an adverse effect on our health, so it became extremely important to me that whatever I did would help lessen that toxic load.”
To that end, Britta, did two things:

founded the Cinco Vidas blog—“cinco vidas” means “five lives” in Spanish, in honor of the five times her father renewed his commitment to life. 
She wrote When Cancer Hits, the guide she wished she had when she was caring for her father. 

and created CV Skinlabs, a new skin care line that would set a new standard of safety, while effectively repairing and nourish sensitive skin back to radiant health.


“I learned that applying the right combinations of bio-compatible ingredients was critical to restoring and healing the skin without irritation,” Britta says. She had every single ingredient toxicologically reviewed before clearing it for use in her formulas, to ensure each one had a 100% clean assessment.
“This was the only way I could make sure that my formulas were truly safe, while clinical testing ensured the formulas worked,” she said.

<p>Let us introduce you to “Our Mom”, the most wonderful, beautiful, and strongest woman we know – Louise Velasquez. Louise has been happily married for 40 years to our awesome dad, John. Together they have 4 brilliant children (Crystal, Jessica, Paul, Valarie), 3 amazing in-laws (Jamie, Joe, Stephanie), and 3 glorious grandchildren (Isabella, Isaac, Michael).</p>
<p>We are asking for donations because our mom has been diagnosed with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and the only way for our mom to get better is to have a liver and kidney transplant. Thankfully, she is currently on the list for these organs but the non stop ups and downs of frequent ER visits, overnight hospital stays, dialysis treatments 3x’s a week, weekly doctor appointments and the constant waiting for a phone call become overpowering.</p>
<p>All donations will be used for medical care and expenses. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>Dialysis 3x's week costs $20 per visit</li>
<li>Medications range from $10 - $250 (this does not include medications not covered by insurance)</li>
<li>ER costs $150/visit - Mom is admitted to the hospital at least 1 to 2 times a month</li>
<li>Weekly follow-up appointments with various providers range from $20 for primary care to $50 for specialist appointments</li>
<li>Annual deductible of $2500</li>
<li>5% of what the transplant procedure would cost. For example, if the transplant costs $500,000; our portion would be $25,000.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>As our mom gets stronger, we will be posting progress updates on how she is doing and provide pictures as she recovers. Having never been through something like this before, it is quite overwhelming how quickly a person can deteriorate when your organs don't work properly. We hope to provide inspiration to anyone who is going through similar situations.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Another goal would be to spread the word about the importance of becoming an organ donor. We never understood the impact of organ donation until we were faced with it ourselves. As we learn more, we wish to educate more about this important contribution to life.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you can't contribute, please do not feel like you can't help. You can certainly help us by spreading the word for our cause.

<p class=""paragraph_style"">    <strong>S</strong>upport for <strong>H</strong>umanitarianism through <strong>I</strong>ntercontinental <strong>P</strong>rojects, Inc. was founded by Matthew Berniard (a LSUHSC-S MSII at the time) and his wife Aimee (a LSUS graduate student at the time) in early February of 2009. They took on the task of starting and developing S.H.I.P. after realizing the need for international humanitarian projects at LSUHSC-S. Their goal was to bring all medical students and physicians who were  interested in learning compassionate care to a very rural and underserved area. After much research, Matt found an organization in rural western Kenya, who could provide the infrastructure for conducting mobile clinics, had been in operation for over a decade, and was in a safe area of the world. After receiving a strong interest from about a dozen second and third year students, they decided to move forward with the mission to travel to Kenya in February 2010.</p>
<p class=""paragraph_style"">   </p>
<p class=""paragraph_style"">Ship is a 501(c)3 organization accepting tax deductible donations. However, almost all of our operating funds are generated by medical student activities such as bake sales, garage sales and a yearly pre-med workshop for high school students interested in medicine. For the last 3 years this has supported the yearly trips for as many as 20 students serving approximately 1000 patients over the 3 weeks that they served in western Kenya.  Most of the diseases are neglected tropical diseases such as, malaria, Denge fever, typhoid and tuberculosis to name a few.  This year however, because of the price of travel our organization has fell short.  We are putting together some last minute fundraising but are asking for support so that this valuable service can continue.</p>

    Support for Humanitarianism through Intercontinental Projects, Inc. was founded by Matthew Berniard (a LSUHSC-S MSII at the time) and his wife Aimee (a LSUS graduate student at the time) in early February of 2009. They took on the task of starting and developing S.H.I.P. after realizing the need for international humanitarian projects at LSUHSC-S. Their goal was to bring all medical students and physicians who were  interested in learning compassionate care to a very rural and underserved area. After much research, Matt found an organization in rural western Kenya, who could provide the infrastructure for conducting mobile clinics, had been in operation for over a decade, and was in a safe area of the world. After receiving a strong interest from about a dozen second and third year students, they decided to move forward with the mission to travel to Kenya in February 2010.
   
Ship is a 501(c)3 organization accepting tax deductible donations. However, almost all of our operating funds are generated by medical student activities such as bake sales, garage sales and a yearly pre-med workshop for high school students interested in medicine.

<p>Rosalind's unique process uses resin to protect and preserve the DNA, keeping it safe
forever. The resin itself stunningly catches the light to showcase your DNA.</p>
<p><b>Why </b><b>Rosalind
Treasures™?</b></p>
<p>Rosalind Franklin was born in 1920. After
receiving her Ph.D. from Cambridge in 1945, she worked as a research associate
in London. In early 1951, she took the first X-ray diffraction photographs of
DNA that showed a helical form of the molecule. Rosalind Franklin’s fundamental
contribution to the discovery of DNA's double helix structure is now
– finally – becoming more widely known.  The double helix is to
science what the Mona Lisa is to painting. </p>

<p><b>How can DNA be seen in a pendant?</b></p>
<p>Thanks to Rosalind Treasures™ you
can see DNA. </p>
<p>DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid,
contains the genetic information specific to each human. In other words, DNA is
your unique signature in the universe. DNA is found inside nearly every cell of
your body. In its natural form, DNA is not visible. Rosalind Treasures™ uses
billions and billions of pure DNA molecules extracted from non-mammalian cells,
through a well-established procedure, in order to make DNA visible. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1121859/files/20141229130112-image_ADN.jpg?1419886872"" src="""" style=""width: 116px; height: 87px;""/></p>

sensitivity, passion, love and friends. </p>
<p>We have overcome all the technical and scientific challenges! The remaining challenge is to
get market support.</p>
<p>When introduced the Rosalind Treasures™ keepsake pendant to a trial group earlier this year, we received much supportive and positive feedback. In order to offer the Rosalind Treasures™
keepsake products to a
wider audience, we need to set up a bigger lab
infrastructure and initiate a
marketing campaign. Crowdfunding will allow us to achieve these goals while respecting
our beliefs.</p>
<p><b>Rosalind
Treasures™ is ready to rock!</b></p>
<p>Contributors are at the heart of this
project, as they will enable thousands of others to gain from keeping their DNA
close to them, in a safe environment, while receiving their DNA keepsake item from
Rosalind Treasures™ at a price significantly less than future retail price! </p>

with a passion for the building blocks of life. 
Anne-Marie
Larose, Ph.D., MBA, brings twenty years of diverse experience in the field of life science,
combining both research and business aspects. 
Lucie E.
Létourneau, MBA, PMP, is an enthusiastic business project management professional and she nourishes a passion for
new technologies.
What have
we achieved so far?
The DNA preparation process was developed by Dr. Bergeron,
tested, optimized successfully and standardized respecting recognized protocols. We
have developed prototypes and now we are ready to market!
Why
crowdfunding?
Dr. Dominique Bergeron, with the help
of Rosalind Treasures™, wants to bring an audacious idea to life …with your support
and your faith. All the team members love science and new cool things and want
to make people proud of their DNA.
Dr. Bergeron and her team want to bypass
banks, venture capitalists and professional investors to create a business
funding process based on real people, smiles, families,
sensitivity, passion, love and friends. 
We have overcome all the technical and scientific challenges! The remaining challenge is to
get market support.
When introduced the Rosalind Treasures™ keepsake pendant to a trial group earlier this year, we received much supportive and positive feedback. In order to offer the Rosalind Treasures™
keepsake products to a
wider audience, we need to set up a bigger lab
infrastructure and initiate a
marketing campaign. Crowdfunding will allow us to achieve these goals while respecting
our beliefs.
Rosalind
Treasures™ is ready to rock!
Contributors are at the heart of this
project, as they will enable thousands of others to gain from keeping their DNA
close to them, in a safe environment, while receiving their DNA keepsake item from
Rosalind Treasures™ at a price significantly less than future retail price! 
What we
need ...and what you'll get!
Most of your financial support will
enable us to build up our full inventory and to finalize the setup of the laboratory
equipment, such as the DNA Collection Kits necessary for the DNA
sampling. 
Some of your financial support will
also help us structure the website, fund the perks, expand our team and pay the
Indiegogo processing fees. No salaries will be paid to the founding members. 
What if
the Indiegogo financial goal is not reached?
In the event that we do not reach our
stated goal, we will start off at a smaller scale. 
All the perks (Perk: an advantage or extra thing,
such as goods, that you are given because of your support
to a project or a cause) will be processed and delivered.
When can I expect my delivery?
Once the Indiegogo campaign is
finished, we will start to process orders.
Our goal is delivering your perk (the
awesome keepsake jewelry) to you 6-8 weeks after processing of your order. You
can also expect to receive the gift card within one week of payment of the perk
…so that you can give the best birthday / wedding / anniversary / Holiday gift
ever! 
Keep a memento of your loved one's
uniqueness within your sight, by your side!
Anything helps!
If a financial contribution is not possible
at this time, please share our project with your family and friends! 
Rosalind Treasures™ gives back! For every frame
sent to the contributors through the perk which features the horse frame from
the Indiegogo campaign, 20$ will be given back to a cause of your choice. The FEI World Equestrian Games™
are held every four years, in the middle of the Olympic cycle. The seven FEI
disciplines – Jumping, Dressage and Para-Equestrian Dressage, Eventing,
Driving, Endurance, Vaulting and Reining – are all included on the competition
schedule.
Let's talk
about your DNA! Choose the perk which fits your needs best!
Site under construction but soon to
be rocking! http://www.rosalindstreasures.com/

«Can
you imagine what scientists will have achieved in another 50 years from now? I

then I’m all for it! »
