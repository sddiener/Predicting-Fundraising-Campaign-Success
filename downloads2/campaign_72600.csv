Alex is 27 years old
and for the last 10 years he is captured in a wheelchair by his trauma. He
suffered an accident which caused a spinal cord injury, before this he had an
active lifestyle. Now he wants to be involved in the world outside his room, he
wants to escape it, to work remote, to travel, to take part in special projects
and to continue his once dynamic style of life. 
Alex has a job, a salary and kind people around him, he is still an
active citizen, but limited by four walls and a wheelchair for which Republic
of Moldova is still not adapted. Alex can not afford a special car having a
pension which values just 7$ per month, that’s why the AVAI team designed a
special car for Alex relying on community’s support. 
Solving Alex’s problem we
are offering a solution for anyone else in need.





AVAI car's story
This car is a prototype designed for people with special needs. It is based on an existing chassis, which is approved and meets all the standards of safety. Also it has an economic engine and an automatic gearbox. What is unique about this concept is the integrated wheelchair lift - a mechanism that lifts up and adapts the driver in front of the steering wheel. 




The wheelchair lift concept is, in fact, a mechanical assembly composed of a metal structure and two platforms, which are operated by hydraulic cylinders. Also, all this mechanism is automated using electronic remote control.


   
The Impact
 
When Alex asked us to build a three wheel travel scooter, we realized we can do more for him and, at the same time, we can be useful for the entire world. When someone being in a wheelchair needs such a mean of transport, why can’t we come up with a better idea for all those 65 mil people around the world who have the same need?!
Being in a wheelchair, doesn’t mean they should feel sidelined. That’s why we want to help them and to improve their social life activities. We are too enthusiastic to stop over here, our goal is to develop the concept and you are the one who can help us to improve it.

Mission Statement





Enrich the lives of adults with  special needs by creating and selling quality wines that people love, and donating a portion of the proceeds to local non-profit  (501c-3) organizations that enrich the lives of adults with special needs.
Create advocacy communities in every state where we sell our wines to be a voice for those without a “voice”.

loyal customers that are in some way connected to people with special needs -be
it relatives, care givers, neighbors, friends of the family, or people who
enjoy drinking our wines while at the same time helping someone who needs it
most. 

We need your help to buy more wine from the vineyards and expand our geography of people we are helping.




For the Next 18 Months, Beginning September 2016
 
We
will continue to operate in Connecticut while we are moving our wine operation into
the State of New York, which will happen next. 
We know there is a big demand for our mission and our wines. We already
have a distributor for NY. We shall continue to open the markets of New Jersey
and Massachusetts for our wines and build advocacy communities for adults with

Wine Selection
 
We
will increase our wine selection: 3 varieties produced in USA & 1 imported.
Total selection will be composed of 9 wines. More wines generate more revenues
that generate more donations. 
   Your Support is Crucial  

In a time of
budget crises and shrinking support from State governments, we’ve found a way to help adults
with developmental disabilities: by carving out a social value chain,
from HM&B’s economic value chain, that flows directly to local service
providers.
Some say
these are the ‘forgotten people” or the “people without a voice”.  That is
not true; we have not forgotten them and our social enterprise approach will
support their voices. You, as a contributor, will help to direct support
to your LOCAL community non-profit groups supporting adults living with developmental
disabilities – they become your beneficiaries in this social endeavor. Together
we will not only bring but grow, and sustain, critical resources to the lives
of adults with developmental disabilities.  You are doing a good
thing. 
We urge you
to consider your contribution as a “Seed Donation”. 
We are here to stay and will grow your seed donation into a social value chain
that will support a steady flow of donations to the most vulnerable people
of our great society, those who need our support: adults with developmental

<li>
<strong>Finding the perfect space</strong>: Currently the city of Minneapolis says that doggy daycare's fall within ""dog kennel"" zoning, which means that we will need to find an industrial zoned space.  In Uptown, these are generally the buildings located along the greenway.  This limits the possibilities for spaces to rent, but we WILL find the perfect space!</li>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Why this project?</strong></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>                                                                   </strong></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>To start, Palestine has a special level in the field of education in the Arab World, the percentage of knowledge of reading and writing reaches to 99%. Also  people are intelligent from the innovative side, everyone has his smart phone. But the most challenging thing in this case is the unemployment; its percentage reaches 50%. Because of that we started to search for smart idea to set up our own business. We use technology and marketing via internet all over the world.</strong></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The idea of the project : </strong></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>                                                                                     </strong></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The idea of our project is making Palestinian embroidery manually or automatically and marketing them via internet all over the world and for who like this embroidery. It is worth mentioning that Palestinian embroidery taking a special international increased importance. foreign and Palestinian traders and institution work on promoting this embroidery and the demand increasing everyday on this industries for the importance of them .this embroidery refer to the age of Canaanites and represent to the Palestinians and the solidarity a symbol from the symbols of the Palestinian history . Also it shows how they are connected to their land and gives them a glitter of hope to come back to their homeland. We really started in showing a part of these products on a number of customers outside Palestine and we found that we have the ability to reach for more numbers of customers.</strong></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>                                                       </strong></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong> <br/>Embroidery is one of the most prominent folk art link between past and present, where embroidery system in terms of the distribution of colors and patterns, have increased during the past years pictures wearing Palestinian Popular fashion in cities and motivated to maintain the heritage that Israel is trying to smear and remove him from the Palestinian people to lose one strong evidence his presence on the land of Palestine for thousands of years.Embroidery various forms characteristic of the Palestinian people and is part of the national heritage, social and logo, but it's the special features that characterize the Palestinian people from other peoples, especially as it is stitching his clothes himself and methods traditionally used a needle and thread and which need to be patience and endurance, but that this the craft has been handed down from grandparents to children and grandchildren, through the preservation of the method and style of embroidery, and special workshops that are mostly indoors, specifically in scattered in all the Palestinian territories, refugee camps.It includes embroidered garments of all shapes and colors mismatch jackets, shawls, vests, blankets and pillows, dresses and scarves, sheets of different sizes. And embroidery schools and trends vary from one place to another in terms of design and color yarn used or embroidered manner of spaces and, to the extent that the person knows the area or village or city of his robe.</strong></h3>

Meaning of ( Blessed land )for embroidery and handicrafts
In the hands of Palestinian women Embroidery new creative spiritIt gives touches employment opportunities for women in the Palestinian villages to help them find a source of income and address poverty and unemployment project, as the project maintains a Palestinian cultural heritage that is trying to smear the Israeli occupation. Women's groups from Palestine, I began to think about a creative project to cope with unemployment and help children and their families through the production of hand-embroideries and marketed in countries across the website.Donation idea to become a reality on the ground.In  Palestine This is for achieving some of our targets and participating in the bringing up of our society.
Why this project?
                                                                   
To start, Palestine has a special level in the field of education in the Arab World, the percentage of knowledge of reading and writing reaches to 99%. Also  people are intelligent from the innovative side, everyone has his smart phone. But the most challenging thing in this case is the unemployment; its percentage reaches 50%. Because of that we started to search for smart idea to set up our own business. We use technology and marketing via internet all over the world.
The idea of the project : 
                                                                                     
The idea of our project is making Palestinian embroidery manually or automatically and marketing them via internet all over the world and for who like this embroidery. It is worth mentioning that Palestinian embroidery taking a special international increased importance. foreign and Palestinian traders and institution work on promoting this embroidery and the demand increasing everyday on this industries for the importance of them .this embroidery refer to the age of Canaanites and represent to the Palestinians and the solidarity a symbol from the symbols of the Palestinian history . Also it shows how they are connected to their land and gives them a glitter of hope to come back to their homeland. We really started in showing a part of these products on a number of customers outside Palestine and we found that we have the ability to reach for more numbers of customers.
                                                       
 Embroidery is one of the most prominent folk art link between past and present, where embroidery system in terms of the distribution of colors and patterns, have increased during the past years pictures wearing Palestinian Popular fashion in cities and motivated to maintain the heritage that Israel is trying to smear and remove him from the Palestinian people to lose one strong evidence his presence on the land of Palestine for thousands of years.Embroidery various forms characteristic of the Palestinian people and is part of the national heritage, social and logo, but it's the special features that characterize the Palestinian people from other peoples, especially as it is stitching his clothes himself and methods traditionally used a needle and thread and which need to be patience and endurance, but that this the craft has been handed down from grandparents to children and grandchildren, through the preservation of the method and style of embroidery, and special workshops that are mostly indoors, specifically in scattered in all the Palestinian territories, refugee camps.It includes embroidered garments of all shapes and colors mismatch jackets, shawls, vests, blankets and pillows, dresses and scarves, sheets of different sizes. And embroidery schools and trends vary from one place to another in terms of design and color yarn used or embroidered manner of spaces and, to the extent that the person knows the area or village or city of his robe.

The benefits of this project

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I have spent 6 years dedicating the success of my career in the military, to fitness. As a NCO in the US Army Infantry, rigorous training is directly supported by an equally rigorous passion for fitness. </p>
<ul>
<li>I am Army Sgt Spencer Livesay. I was driven deeper into fitness by my MOS. I was fortunate enough to train various physical training events. Combining both a passion for fitness, and desire to help others succeed in this area, is the only goal I have left in life.</li>
<li>I am raising money to open the first location, and pursue my dream.</li>
<li>Outside of obviously helping to further my love of health and fitness, you would also contribute to those with the same passion, but not quite as knowledgeable in the field yet. This would enable us to interact and accelerate their results.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>I need $200,000 total funds to open this location. $156,000 covers everything on the Nutrishop side, from $70,000 inventory, to complete interior build out of the store, and signage on the outside. the remaining $36,000 covers a required year lease paid in full, upfront.</li>
<li>I don't plan to stop at one location, however this is the immediate focus. To all investors, I will expect you to link over to my facebook, send me a message about your investment, and gain my personal contact information. This will enable me to offer advice, lifetime discounts on every product I sell, and national shipping to get those products to you!</li>
<li>If I don't reach my entire goal, funds raised will at least serve as collateral in obtaining a traditional source of funding. Which I have been attempting to receive, while talking to more lenders than I knew existed. I will also run a secondary campaign, to continue raising funds, until I am able to step forward into this dream.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know the difference their contribution will make:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fitness builds confidence, and confidence sparks creativity, courage to pursue goals, and a positive energy shared to everyone around you. I personally feel that by allowing yourself to accomplish hard set goals, you manifest a world around you, where anything is possible.</li>
<li>I desire to work along side, personally, no matter how many stores I end up opening, because I am here to help others. I want my success, to reach out to more people to help them achieve their own. I want to drive your fitness goals to fruition, along side of you.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>People value your transparency. Be open and stand out by providing insight into the risks and obstacles you may face on the way to achieving your goal.</p>
<ul>
<li>The unequivocal drive to establish success, and to work hard, no matter the consequences or sacrifices, has been some of the core values that have molded and shaped my life over the last several years. The pure discipline that governs my thoughts and actions, has structured a possibility for success. I don't need help working, I need help to be given the opportunity to work. To pour my soul into a project, and see it grow from nothing, is what will help me to maintain a positive outlook through this entire process. When doors have been slammed in my face, and I have been told to ""kick rocks"", I haven't allowed any of it to diminish my determination. I continuously walk in to the next potential investor with the exact same, defiant mind set, that despite what anyone says, I will eventually make this happen.</li>
<li>There is an amazing structure in place with this opportunity. One on one advising, step by step guidance from license purchase to opening day, a community of other franchisees within the surrounding areas, and a complete itemization of full start up costs, projected over head on a 12 month and then 2 year profit and loss sheet. All of this has given a complete financial layout of what's ahead. Which also enables preparation for these hurdles. One thing we instill in all of our soldiers in the Army, is to have a PACE plan. Primary, alternate, contingency, and emergency plan. A series of fail safes to cover any potential set backs.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>I understand that not everyone is able to donate, but you can always help by using your network to extend the word about this project. Putting positive energy out into the universe, will one day come back to you 10 fold, and just spreading the word, could encourage someone to become proactive about their own fitness journey! Even just reaching out to me personally and offering encouragement, can help me continue to stay positive and focused!</li>
<li>Of course, don't forget to use the indiegogo share tools to spread the word. I sincerely look forward to one day working within a network of people, striving towards bettering their life, and the world around us. Thank you all so much!</li>

<h2><strong>Qu’est-ce que le Rond-Point?</strong></h2>
<p>Depuis bientôt un an, l’équipe du Rond-Point travaille à mettre sur pied un café à vocation sociale dans le quartier Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.

Sa collaboration avec les organismes du quartier permettra de centraliser les informations les concernant ainsi que les services offerts dans le quartier, en plus d’offrir des ateliers de différentes natures répondant aux multiples champs d'intérêt de toutes les résidentes et de tous les résidents du quartier et ceux des alentours.<br/> <br/>Une salle de réunion sera offerte pour les organismes, les entreprises et les travailleurs et travailleuses autonomes, dans une formule tout inclus comprenant boissons, nourriture et service multimédia.

Le café sera à l’image du quartier, ce qui se traduit par une mixité sociale inclusive, et s’établira dans ses quartiers au courant de l'année 2017.<br/> <br/>Nous mettrons l'espace du café à la disposition des initiatives citoyennes en tout genre, soit sous forme de prêt ou de location, selon les événements et les besoins. Ce que nous voulons, c’est encourager la réappropriation des lieux par la clientèle du café en permettant aux artistes d'exposer, d'offrir des spectacles et des performances ainsi que promouvoir les projets citoyens. Il s’agit d’offrir un espace convivial et inclusif pour que tous les types de clientèle s'y sentent les bienvenus, tout en étant sécuritaire pour les familles.<br/> <br/>Nous espérons que vous voyez, tout comme nous,  les merveilleuses opportunités qu’un projet comme celui-ci apportera au quartier Hochelaga-Maisonneuve!<br/><br/><strong>Ce dont nous avons besoin!</strong><br/>Les coûts de démarrage sont évalués à 130 000$ et avec cette campagne de sociofinancement nous aimerions ramasser 20 000$ pour financer une partie du projet.  </p>
<p><strong>Comment allons-nous financer le projet?</strong><br/>Nos sources de revenus proviendront de trois sources différentes: les subventions, la campagne de sociofinancement et les prêts. Nous avons déjà amassé, via des subventions, 10 000$ à ce jour!<br/> <br/><strong>Où ira l'argent que nous ramasserons?</strong><br/>L'argent amassé permettra:</p>

<h3><strong>What is the Rond-Point?</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>For nearly a year, the Rond-Point (“Roundabout”) team has been at work setting up a social café in the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve neighborhood. The idea of ​​building up a collective and inclusive space in a neighborhood as effervescent as Hochelaga-Maisonneuve brought together the three founding members around this project that is mixing a restaurant, social organizing and socio-cultural activities.</p>
<p>The Rond-Point, a self-managed café, is a working co-operative located in the west end of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, on commercial Ontario Street. The purpose of this social café will be to offer good value for money on drinks and food, a multimedia room available for rent and, especially, some real involvement in the neighborhood. Its collaboration with the community’s organizations will enable a gathering of information concerning these and the services offered in the vicinity, in addition to an offer of various workshops on multiple subjects of interest to all residents of the neighborhood.</p>
<p>A meeting room will also be offered for organizations, businesses and self-employed workers in a package deal including beverages, food and multimedia tools. It will then be possible to hold meetings there with peace of mind and to suit all needs thanks to our installation that will be including a projector, a screen, a phone conference system, a webcam and a videoconferencing system as well as professional, adapted tech support. The café will reflect Hochelaga-Maisonneuve’s image, which translates into an inclusive social mix, and will be established in the neighborhood in 2017.</p>
<p>We will make café space available for citizens’ initiatives of all kinds, either in the form of loans or leases depending on events and needs. We want to encourage the reappropriation of the space by the café’s clientele by allowing artists to exhibit, to plan shows and performances as well as to promote projects from residents. It’s about offering a friendly and inclusive space so that all types of clientele feel welcome, while being safe for families too.</p>
<p>We hope that like us, you can see all the wonderful opportunities a project like this will bring to the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve neighborhood!</p>
<p><strong>What we need</strong></p>
<p>The start-up costs are estimated at $130,000 and with this crowdfunding campaign, we would like to raise $20,000 to fund part of the project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How will we finance the project?</strong></p>
<p>We will have three different sources of income: grants, the crowdfunding campaign, and loans.</p>
<p>Where will the received money go?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Raised money will help us:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Develop café space in order to provide a safe and welcoming place for everyone;</li>
<li>Arrange the multimedia room in order to make it as functional as possible;</li>
<li>Print information tools about community organizations and neighborhood services;</li>
<li>Organize several low-cost activities for people in precarious situations in the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve neighborhood.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<h3><u>Who We Are</u></h3>
<p>Local, fresh, small, original, delicious, organic, humane, homemade with love, and ready to serve YOU! </p>
<ul>
<li>Borolos Pizza is a local pizza shop in Santa Rosa, CA. Our pizzas are made with purpose (and in-house, vegan sourdough crust). We believe that pizza is a source of happiness, and you should fuel your happy with quality ingredients. Everyone deserves to eat better pizza. We keep our prices fair, and our food fresh and organic, using humanely raised meats, and local dairy and produce (that Point Reyes Blue on a Pepperoni Pie. You gotta try it).</li>
<li>We took over Borolos Pizza in January of this year. We are a small business, run by real people. I am a single mother, a veteran, a teacher's daughter, and I am asking for your help. Our first few months have been a roller coaster of a learning curve, with deep failures and amazing success, thank to our die hard fans! </li>

<li>Borolos Pizza needs $25,000 to keep it running. Costs for new equipment and renovations required by local permitting, maintenance of existing equipment, and maintaining the ability to continue sourcing local, and supporting Sonoma County and Northern California businesses are our priorities. Here is some of the equipment and repairs your contribution will fund:<ul>
<li>New Prep sink and updated plumbing</li>
<li>New Refrigerators and work top tables </li>
<li>New By-the-slice Display  </li>
<li>ADA countertop at register</li>
<li>General required repairs</li>

</li>
<li>If our entire goal is not reached, your contributions will still be put to good use, and kept local! In addition to the most immediate permitting concerns, here are some of the local businesses we source from, and this is where your contributions will go:<ul>

<h3>We want to hear from YOU</h3>
<p>We haven't been doing this long, but we hope to...</p>
<ul>
<li>The response that we have received from those of you who have stuck with us on this journey so far is overwhelming. The kind words, the constructive criticism, the shared stories. We want to hear more. We want to be a part of this community in a meaningful way, just as you have come to be a part of ours, whether you know it or not. </li>
<li>There is too much abundance in CA for anyone to be hungry, and everyone deserves a treat. We hope that we can continue to contribute to our community, including veterans, teachers, children, and those in need in meaningful ways. If this campaign is successful, we hope that you will let us know about opportunities to support the community in ways that are meaningful to you. </li>

Local, fresh, small, original, delicious, organic, humane, homemade with love, and ready to serve YOU! 

Borolos Pizza is a local pizza shop in Santa Rosa, CA. Our pizzas are made with purpose (and in-house, vegan sourdough crust). We believe that pizza is a source of happiness, and you should fuel your happy with quality ingredients. Everyone deserves to eat better pizza. We keep our prices fair, and our food fresh and organic, using humanely raised meats, and local dairy and produce (that Point Reyes Blue on a Pepperoni Pie. You gotta try it).
We took over Borolos Pizza in January of this year. We are a small business, run by real people. I am a single mother, a veteran, a teacher's daughter, and I am asking for your help. Our first few months have been a roller coaster of a learning curve, with deep failures and amazing success, thank to our die hard fans! 


 

What We Need & What You Get
 

Borolos Pizza needs $25,000 to keep it running. Costs for new equipment and renovations required by local permitting, maintenance of existing equipment, and maintaining the ability to continue sourcing local, and supporting Sonoma County and Northern California businesses are our priorities. Here is some of the equipment and repairs your contribution will fund:
New Prep sink and updated plumbing
New Refrigerators and work top tables 
New By-the-slice Display  
ADA countertop at register
General required repairs


We can't wait to share our perks with you! Pizza parties, kind shirts and sweet hats, and your pizza creation on our menu, just to name a few!

If our entire goal is not reached, your contributions will still be put to good use, and kept local! In addition to the most immediate permitting concerns, here are some of the local businesses we source from, and this is where your contributions will go:
FEED Sonoma
Marin-Sonoma Produce
Keith Giustos Bakery Supply
Imwalle Gardens
Sonoma County Meat Company
Zoes Meats
Sunset Linen
Myers Restaurant Supply
North Bay Restaurant Services
Pro-Appliance Repair




We want to hear from YOU
We haven't been doing this long, but we hope to...

The response that we have received from those of you who have stuck with us on this journey so far is overwhelming. The kind words, the constructive criticism, the shared stories. We want to hear more. We want to be a part of this community in a meaningful way, just as you have come to be a part of ours, whether you know it or not. 
There is too much abundance in CA for anyone to be hungry, and everyone deserves a treat. We hope that we can continue to contribute to our community, including veterans, teachers, children, and those in need in meaningful ways. If this campaign is successful, we hope that you will let us know about opportunities to support the community in ways that are meaningful to you. 
We want to know what we can do to better serve you. Please stop by, pick up the phone, follow us on social media. We are real people. Small business is not just about  the neighbor you support, its about how we can earn your trust and build a stronger community for all of us. 

Your contribution is not without risk. I am asking you to take a leap of faith with me. But I promise, we will be holding hands when we jump.

Now, we are also farmers!</strong></p><p>Over the past twelve months we have built our new dairy farm… literally from the ground up!! This farm is everything that I dreamed it would be – a showcase of sustainable small-scale dairy farming that is all about animal welfare and milk quality. Because our farm is not part of the industrial dairy industry, we have the freedom to do things differently. Our herd is small and is made up of old breed cows that are no longer commercially viable. Our calves are all raised, not killed at birth. And we are organic.</p><p>Since September last year, we have been making all of our cheese from our own milk that comes from our happy herd of organically raised, heritage breed cows… and our cheese has never tasted better! I could not be more proud of what we have achieved in the last year… or more excited about our future.</p><p>In order to make enough cheese for you all in the next year or so, we need to increase our herd from just over 50 cows to 80 milking cows. So, together, we need to buy another 30 Normande and Australian Dairy Shorthorns cows.</p><p><strong>That’s where you come in!</strong></p><p>If you missed out the chance to sponsor one of beautiful cows last year, you now have the opportunity again.</p><p><strong>SPONSOR ONE OF OUR BEAUTIFUL OLD BREED COWS:</strong></p><p><strong>Sponsoring a Cow</strong> will earn you some great rewards … not only do you get to name your girl and receive a professionally taken portrait of her, we will also send a whole year’s supply of cheese.  That’s every Cheese Club Offer for the year. You will also receive a signed copy of my book, Milk.Made, and you will become an important member of our Farm Family and receive regular updates and invitations to special events on the farm and around Australia.</p><p>If doing this as an individual is not possible, how about getting a few families together, or even your workplace? That way you can also all share in the bounty of cheese that will come your way every month.</p><p>So come on! Get involved in this really special farm and sponsor one of our gorgeous old breed dairy cows and help us to create the best dairy farm in Australia.</p><p><strong>The Cows</strong></p><p>The breeds we have selected to use are Brown Swiss and Australian Dairy Shorthorn. These are breeds that are considered commercially unviable these days but were once both prized for producing excellent quality milk for cheesemaking. In the past 6 months since we started milking, the decision to go for older breeds has paid off. Although the quantity of milk our cows give is less than half that would be expected from an industrial dairy, the quality has been outstanding and the character of the cheese we have made is next level.</p><p><strong>The Farm</strong></p><p>The Huon Valley was once a vibrant dairy region and was once home to dozens of small dairies. Sadly, today, they are all gone – unable to compete against the huge low-cost dairy farms that are now the standard in Australia. This dairy farm (the first to open in the Huon Valley in over half a century) will prove that small-scale, quality dairy farming can be viable in this country. It is 90 acres on the banks of the beautiful Huon River. We also lease an additional 100 acres on the opposite side of the river where we grow grass and (will soon start to) make organic compost. The farm has been in the same family since European settlement until we acquired it at the start of last year.</p><p><strong>Why is this farm important?</strong></p><p>It is widely agreed that the dairy industry has some major issues. Farmers are now at the mercy of global markets and pricing. Dairy farms are getting bigger and bigger and now resemble milk factories more than farms. In order to stay afloat in this environment, farmers are forced to apply more and more pressure to their animals, their land and also themselves. Some struggle to stay afloat and are forced to leave the industry.</p><p>Our farm is different. Because it operates outside of the regular dairy industry, we have the ability to make some choices about how it is run that more conventional farmers are not able to make. These choices effect every aspect of the farm. Our farm is also small – one of the smallest commercial dairy farms in Australia. And it’s certified organic. We use old breeds that are no longer considered viable but were once prized for the quality of their milk. We put animal welfare ahead of profitability and sustainability ahead of efficiency. We are committed to raising our calves, not slaughtering them as is the common industry practice with bobby calves. The breeds we have chosen are excellent dual-purpose breeds and will be raised on the property for rose veal and beef, which will then be offered back to our customers to purchase.</p><p><strong>A bit about Bruny Island Cheese Co.</strong></p><p>Since 2003, Bruny Island Cheese Co has pushed the boundaries and helped raise the standard for artisan cheese in Australia. When I first started the business, I was told that I had a choice: I could make a difference, or I could be successful. Well, I reckon we have done both. We were the first producer of unpasteurised milk cheese, despite being told it would never happen, and we reinvented the way cheese is sold in Australia through our Cheese Club. We are now an award winning successful small business, located on an island off the south coast of Tasmania, and every day we try and make a difference to the way cheese is made, sold and eaten in Australia.</p><p>Now we want to set a new standard in dairy farming. And we want you to be a part of it.</p><p>Being a supported of our farm means you will be supporting positive change in the dairy industry and being part of a viable, sustainable alternative.  All of our supporters become a member of our ‘Farm Family’ community and not only receive some great rewards for your support but also regular updates from the farm and opportunities to get involved in it.</p><p><strong>Who are we?</strong></p><p>We are a team of passionate, determined, innovative people. Here are some of the key people that are key to the business:</p><p><strong>Nick Haddow</strong>: Managing Director the founder of the business. Nick has two decades of experience in the dairy industry in Australia and overseas. He is also the author of Milk.Made. – his new book on cheese.</p><p><strong>Richard Butler</strong>: Farm Manager. Along with his wife Karen, Richard looks after the farm at Glen Huon Dairy – and we are very lucky to have them on the team. Richard is a specialist in organic dairying and moved from Devon, England to be a part of this project.</p><p><strong>Luke Jackson</strong>: Production Manager. Luke is our amazing head cheesemaker. Luke discovered his passion for cheese making while working in the mining industry in WA where good cheese was hard to come by…. So he started making his own. Luke joined our team after returning to his home state and his skills as a cheesemaker have gone from strength to strength.</p><p><strong>Tori Keygan</strong>: General Manager.

Hello,
This is canvas!!
We are a group of 6 from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. We are a group of friends fascinated by the game of paintball.
The ambition to be the founders of a paintball arena arose when we saw that there were  people of all ages and personalities that would love to enjoy a game of paintball here in addisababa!!

our main aim is  to make it as safe as possible. We also hope to provide everyone a place to go to loosen up and enjoy a good game. We sincerely believe this arena will provide a good enviroment for people to let out aggression, stress,  boredom, and just have a good time.
It is also our aim to provide teens who struggle with addiction problems and depression a place to release all that negative energy and focus on the positive ones. It will be a healthy way for them to have fun and stay fit.
But the materials we need to make the arena a safe and fully equiped enviroment are not readily available in our country and are extremely expensive. Most of them have to be imported from abroad which ends up adding more price. Some of these items would be the
Marker paintball rifles ( the paintball guns)
                                Air powered rifles that shoot specialized paintball pellets with pressurized canisters as a power source
Paintball pellets (ammunition for the guns)
                                Small pellets filled with paint that serve as the ammunition
Rent of the arena            
                                A field / warehouse ( about 1000 spr meters)
Compressors
                                Needed to refill the paintball gun's canisters
Although we have a solid plan to make this project work we face some challenges, like the fact that  most of the materials we need are not readily available in our country, the bureaucracy and other related stuffs. As a whole the environment  that we are working in is not that supportive but with your support we will get there.
We seek  your help in solving these financial problems and making this dream come true.

</div></div>","Millions of babies all over the world don't have access to baby pacifiers. Hi Backers I'm Marco, Two years ago I started creating  Paci the flying baby pacifier, when I had an awakening moment.There are millions of babies in the world that don't have access to a baby pacifier. Even some welfare institutions don't have enough baby pacifiers for their little babies.Babies should have their own baby pacifiers. Its an easy relaxing way to get them out of stress.Not only does sucking on a pacifier provide comfort and security to non-verbal infants, but its use has been associated with a decreased incidence of SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.) so you might be helping saving babies lives with your donations.Also, when an infant becomes a toddler, a pacifier habit is always easier to stop than a thumb habit. With your help, we can try to provide at least one baby pacifier for every little baby out there!You will help solve a real problem that is happening all the time everywhere in the world.If we reach our goal we will help Ten Thousand babies! How awesome is that? In return, apart the personal satisfaction for helping at least one baby, we got this awesome perks for you:

Flour tortillas will be made with einkorn, spelt,  sprouted brown rice, quinoa flours. Our chorizos, mole sauces, salsas, hot sauce, and queso fresco are also all made fresh daily in small batches. In addition to a variety of meat dishes, we will have many <b><i>vegetarian</i> </b>and some <b><i>vegan</i> </b>options, most of our dishes are <b>gluten-free. </b>We will cook with coconut oil, olive, oil, bran rice oil, butter and sometimes lard and will incorporate more nuts and seeds in our cooking.

José has been cooking for more than 15 years and has built his trade through many experiences within the Bay Area community. His career began as a Prep Cook and Line Cook at Bix and Nopa, respectively. Jose, then transitioned from Nopa to it's sister restaurant Nopalito, after being asked to develop the menu and serve as the opening Chef; here he received  recognition during his 4 year tenure. In addition, Jose, was the Executive Chef at Sabrosa, and is currently overseeing the kitchen at Nido in Oakland. Over the course of the last 6 years, especially, he has tested  and perfected many recipes including carnitas, pozole, mole sauces, chorizos and many more. Jose also has experience grinding nixtamal to make the best corn masa, with different textures! This is a must try!  He is constantly exploring complex regional Mexican recipes and all kinds of different salsas to continue to build upon his craft and share with the community. Several accolades include: 




-Esquire

-Nopalito

-Nopalito - Sunset

-NIdo 



Elizabeth,  Jose's wife, has always loved to cook, as her passion was instilled growing up. Elizabeth's style of cooking – simple, flavorful, prepared with love and shared with joy – is passed down from her Mother.  In fact, her mom always says, ""con amor sabe major”, which translates to ""it tastes better when made with love"". Elizabeth would like to honor her Mom by continuing to cook for others with passion and delight. In addition, she is a graduate of the renowned Culinary Institute of America.







Food philosophy Our menu is inspired by the traditional cooking of Mexico, prepared with seasonal, local & organic produce. For us, quality, flavor, and hospitality are paramount.
We are committed to making almost everything from scratch; made-to-order tortillas, to toasting our own spices and formulating our own spice blends. Flour tortillas will be made with einkorn, spelt,  sprouted brown rice, quinoa flours. Our chorizos, mole sauces, salsas, hot sauce, and queso fresco are also all made fresh daily in small batches. In addition to a variety of meat dishes, we will have many vegetarian and some vegan options, most of our dishes are gluten-free. We will cook with coconut oil, olive, oil, bran rice oil, butter and sometimes lard and will incorporate more nuts and seeds in our cooking. We will use maple syrup, coconut palm sugar, honey, and piloncillo. We will also offer take-away items such as mole sauces, salsas, hot sauces, tortilla chips, guacamole, and much more!





Carnitas tacos



Farms/Purveryors: Happy Boy Farm, tomatero farms, rancho gordo, heirloom organic gardens, lucero farms, yerena farm, water2table, five dot ranch, masienda, giusto's, five dot ranch, St. John Family Farms, llano seco rancho, casa rosa farms, Iacopi Farms, Triple T ranch and farm, Fulton Valley, Pasture 42, Wise Acre Farm, Full Belly Farm, Brokaw Nursery, Massa Natural Meats, Spring hill  cheese, Clover Stornetta, True Grass Farms, and many more!




With YOUR  support, we will be able to purchase the following: 
- custom taco cart
- griddle & fryer
- pots and pans 
- tables, tent, ice chest coolers 

We have big dreams, if we are able to raise more!  With 15,000 we can include a stone corn grinder to make our our masa using brightly colored heirloom corn. Let's preserve heirloom corn; it's beautiful, tasty and nutritious.

<h3><b>What is tagavent</b></h3>
Tagavent adds a new and different dimension to organizing and enjoying your social life.  We have designed a new and exciting social calendar that enables you to
create find and share all kinds of amazing events. What’s more,
having found an event, we make it easy for you to purchase tickets and invite
anyone else who you think might be interested in attending.</div><div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Each time you log on to tagavent your personal calendar will display a host of fresh events, all in one place, making it easy to stay in touch with what friends and family are doing, and to keep up to date with what’s going on in your wider social circle. Our guest list enables you to find like-minded people who share the same interests and you can easily connect with them by sending an Ice Breaker request. After the event is over you can upload your pictures for the event and also view pictures from other users who went.</span></div><div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">When we were considering what we could do to enhance individual lives by using social media, we found that the problem with many existing social networking sites was that they lack information about upcoming events. Instead, they simply enable you to spread the word about what you and your friends are already doing.</span><br/><p><br/></p>

<p></p>
<h3><b>Create, Find and Share Events</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We have designed Tagavent to make it as easy as possible to create new events by making your personal calendar the centre of your social world. You can use it to check out what events are being held in your area over the coming months and even to purchase tickets, courtesy of Ticketmaster and Skiddle. Tagavent will also display a list of suggested events based on the criteria you have provided, detailing which of your friends and acquaintances are attending.</span><br/></p>
<p>By accessing your calendar, you can see immediately who is going to which events. You might want to arrange a surprise birthday party for someone, for example; so you have the option of restricting who can see the event to only specific family members and friends, while also blocking the guest of honour from viewing the information, which would obviously prevent the party from being a surprise. </p>

<h3><b>Inviting Your Friends</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>We will post “suggested” events on your calendar, based on the information you provided when joining.  You can also  see which of your friends are going to an event. You can invite people you would like to go with and see who has accepted your invitations. There is also a messaging system that makes keeping in touch a piece of cake.</p>
<p>Your calendar carries details of all the events your contacts are due to attend and past events they have already attended. With the facility to make comments about the event you have attended or are going to attend it makes it really easy to get a feel of how much fun your friends had.</p>
<p></p>

<br/><p>
</p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>Uploading and Sharing Photos</b></h3>
<p>We think
that one of the coolest Tagavent features is the ability to upload your
favourite photos from all the events you have attended. By posting a tagged URL to
the internet, your shots of each event can be viewed by anyone else that was
there or by individuals who were unable to go but would like to see what it was
like. </p>
<p>This is a great way of ensuring your pictures are seen by as many people as possible, and because all your images are stored by event together in one easy to access location you are more likely to look back at them and recall the fun that you and your friends had. You can also view photos that other people who were there have uploaded, so you can get an overview of the entire event from several different perspectives. Imagine being able to look at pictures taken by all the people who were at the same football match or festival. By doing so you can get a real taste of the atmosphere.<br/><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/976429/files/20141101011000-Photos.png?1414829400"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>You don’t have to attend an event in order to view other people’s photos and comments, which is useful if you are considering going to something similar in the future. Being able to view images depicting how others enjoyed themselves is a great way of deciding whether it is something you might like to experience for yourself.<br/><br/>If you are thinking of taking in a concert or festival whilst holidaying abroad, having the ability to check out what previous events were like is particularly useful. Looking at the photographs uploaded by locals who attended is a great way of learning a little about the venue and the type of people you could expect to meet there.<br/></p>

<h3><b>Meeting Like Minded People (Ice Breakers)</b></h3>
<p>Here at
Tagavent we believe it’s time people started to widen their circle of friends
by meeting new people with similar interests, which is precisely why we are so
excited about the icebreaker. Our icebreaker invitation enables anyone to check
out what events other like-minded people are attending and send a request to
join in the fun. This is a great way of meeting new people who you know will
have the same interests as you; what’s more, you actually get to meet them
rather than just communicating with them online.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/976435/files/20141101011403-Ice_Breaker.png?1414829643"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>At tagavent we have tried to go further than the existing social media sites by enabling our members to not only chat and share photos and comments of past events, but also meet and interact with like-minded people who share the same interests. Now if you want to plan future visits to the cinema, opera, festivals, carnivals, ballet, theatre, concerts, sports, you will always find someone who you can go with.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/976437/files/20141101011515-Requests.png?1414829715"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div><p><br/></p></div>
</div><div><h3><b>The Vision</b></h3></div><div>So.... how did all this come about?</div><div>Tagavent was born on a Eurostar train from Paris to London about 18 months ago. I was coming home to the UK for a short break, and I was spending alot of time texting my friends trying to  arrange for everyone to meet in the same place at the same time. Some could make a certain time but some could not etc etc. It became a nightmare. I began thinking what if there was an events based social calendar website where all this could be co-ordinated? So the original idea was just a simple website where you could create an event at, say, a pub, and invite your friends. This developed when we started thinking about getting groups of people together to attend concerts, gigs etc, and even further as we realised this would be a great opportunity for strangers to meet who shared the same passions had common interests, hence the development of the ""Icebreaker"" function. The end result was tagavent.<br/><br/><br/><h3><b>The Launch</b></h3>As one of the most vibrant and exciting cities in the world,
London is the ideal place to launch Tagavent. The combination of the rock and
pop scene, theatres, clubs and pubs, not to mention comedy venues makes it one
of the most social places on the planet. Help us take the population of London
by storm, and take their social lives to a new level! From there we will go
global!

<h3><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>In today’s fast moving world more and more individuals are turning to their
mobiles for information, updates and socialising. 73% of online adults now
use a social networking site of some kind. Facebook is the dominant social
networking platform in the number of users, but a striking number of users are
now diversifying onto other platforms, which is why for the success of
tagavent we need to be mobile.</p>
<p>Our mobile app has already been designed and looks amazing. Now we need your
help in building the app, so everyone can enjoy tagavent. </p>
<p>We also need funding to kick start our visibility by launching a really
effective marketing campaign. The more people that become involved with
tagavent the more fun it will be for everyone.</p>
<p>In order to fund the development of the Apple and Android App, and the
marketing campaign, $100,000 is required. Development of both apps will take
around 3 months.</p>

<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>
<p>We did extensive market research on Tagavent’s potential competition,
Facebook, Meetup and Eventbrite etc. What
we discovered is that while these websites covered some of what Tagavent do,
none of them covered everything. We also believe that Tagavent UX is superior,
and that Tagavent can generate a lot more excitement.</p>
<p>
Critical
to the success of the business is a successful launch, with enthusiastic
founder members, with the site rapidly gaining traction. Any kind of social
site which does not have many members is not interesting. Tagavent has to grow
fast and become well known quickly.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>

<h3>How You Can Help Us</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>W<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">e need to quickly get traction and get a rapid start. Without excitement and enthusiasm of members,
this business is nothing. This is why we need our contributors to be excited about our project and spread the word to all friends and family.

join in the fun. This is a great way of meeting new people who you know will
have the same interests as you; what’s more, you actually get to meet them
rather than just communicating with them online.


At tagavent we have tried to go further than the existing social media sites by enabling our members to not only chat and share photos and comments of past events, but also meet and interact with like-minded people who share the same interests. Now if you want to plan future visits to the cinema, opera, festivals, carnivals, ballet, theatre, concerts, sports, you will always find someone who you can go with.


The VisionSo.... how did all this come about?Tagavent was born on a Eurostar train from Paris to London about 18 months ago. I was coming home to the UK for a short break, and I was spending alot of time texting my friends trying to  arrange for everyone to meet in the same place at the same time. Some could make a certain time but some could not etc etc. It became a nightmare. I began thinking what if there was an events based social calendar website where all this could be co-ordinated? So the original idea was just a simple website where you could create an event at, say, a pub, and invite your friends. This developed when we started thinking about getting groups of people together to attend concerts, gigs etc, and even further as we realised this would be a great opportunity for strangers to meet who shared the same passions had common interests, hence the development of the ""Icebreaker"" function. The end result was tagavent.The LaunchAs one of the most vibrant and exciting cities in the world,
London is the ideal place to launch Tagavent. The combination of the rock and
pop scene, theatres, clubs and pubs, not to mention comedy venues makes it one
of the most social places on the planet. Help us take the population of London
by storm, and take their social lives to a new level! From there we will go
global!







What We Need & What You Get

In today’s fast moving world more and more individuals are turning to their
mobiles for information, updates and socialising. 73% of online adults now
use a social networking site of some kind. Facebook is the dominant social
networking platform in the number of users, but a striking number of users are
now diversifying onto other platforms, which is why for the success of
tagavent we need to be mobile.
Our mobile app has already been designed and looks amazing. Now we need your
help in building the app, so everyone can enjoy tagavent. 
We also need funding to kick start our visibility by launching a really
effective marketing campaign. The more people that become involved with
tagavent the more fun it will be for everyone.
In order to fund the development of the Apple and Android App, and the
marketing campaign, $100,000 is required. Development of both apps will take
around 3 months.






What You Get Being a ContributorTagavent is all about socialising, getting together and meeting new people and thats exactly what we want to promote with this campaign. We think being part of tagavent at the beginning will be a really exciting journey for both us and our members. We plan to offer free premium membership to all our contributors. Premium membership will entitle you to be entered in to a free draw so they can attend concerts, festivals or even  sporting events and enjoy what tagavent is designed to do - have fun and enjoy your social life. We will of course be offering perks such as stickers, fridge magnets, key rings and much more all marked with the tagavent logo.


Risks & Challenges

We did extensive market research on Tagavent’s potential competition,
Facebook, Meetup and Eventbrite etc. What
we discovered is that while these websites covered some of what Tagavent do,
none of them covered everything. We also believe that Tagavent UX is superior,
and that Tagavent can generate a lot more excitement.

Critical
to the success of the business is a successful launch, with enthusiastic
founder members, with the site rapidly gaining traction. Any kind of social
site which does not have many members is not interesting. Tagavent has to grow
fast and become well known quickly.  


How You Can Help Us


We need to quickly get traction and get a rapid start. Without excitement and enthusiasm of members,
this business is nothing. This is why we need our contributors to be excited about our project and spread the word to all friends and family. When signing up to tagavent we suggest you sign up using Facebook Connect. This will allow you to instantly invite all your friends from Facebook to come and join the excitement.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3>
<p>Dip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah is a subscription based mail order lucky dip, created as a fresh and fun way to support ethical companies, while at the same time providing job opportunities for people with barriers to employment. We aim to launch in 2015.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444728412/e52up972wssmqnjvrpmc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>
<b>How does it work?</b><br/>
</h3>
<p>Subscription fees are low, just £2.95 a month, so that as many people as possible can take part. </p>
<p>Dips are divided by age and gender, so that subscribers receive relevant gifts, and companies reach relevant markets.<br/></p>
<p>A percentage of every subscription goes directly to the companies we support (£1.00 per subscription) and pays for the gifts and vouchers that our subscribers receive. Every subscriber receives a gift every month. Gifts range from thoughtful tokens, such as a miniature Fairtrade chocolate bar, through to hundreds of pounds in vouchers to spend in the online ethical and fair trade shops that we are partnered with - it's a lucky dip, so every month is an exciting surprise! Because our higher value prizes are awarded as gift vouchers, you get to choose what you spend them on. Our suppliers carry an extensive range of products including beauty and grooming, clothing, toys, homewares and edible goods.<br/></p>
<p>The rest of the subscription fee covers overheads (package and posting costs, salaries, business premises, etc). A small percentage of each subscription is retained as profit.</p>
<p>Initially, subscriptions will be available in the UK. We plan to make subscriptions available in other territories as soon as possible.<br/></p>
<h3>Who benefits?</h3>
<h4>Ethical and fair trade retailers and producers<br/>
</h4>
<p>We have already linked with lots of extremely well established and well respected ethical companies, and between them they stock an extensive range of fair trade and ethical goods from across the globe, encompassing everything from slavery free, cradle-to-cradle certified, locally produced, organic, carbon-neutral, collective and cooperative produced, recycled, upcycled and charity supporting products, to name just a few! <br/></p>
<p>Dip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah lucky dips provide each and every one of these companies and all of their producers with the opportunity to reach new markets, expand their customer base and increase their sales. <br/></p>
<h4>People with barriers to employment<br/>
</h4>
<p>As packing the envelopes is straightforward, we are also able to provide job opportunities for people with barriers to employment - those barriers may be due to homelessness, physical disabilities or cognitive impairments. We aim to create a supportive and inclusive working environment to build a strong and happy team. This enables us to have a positive impact on the local community, as well as the global community!</p>
<h4>Exploited workers<br/>
</h4>
<p>The long term goal is to channel a high proportion of our profits into establishing a foundation to improve working conditions for those employed in the production of consumer goods. We are exploring the most effective ways of assisting the greatest number of people. Currently, the emphasis is on lobbying for changes in legislation, and ensuring those changes are implemented.</p>
<h4>The subscribers</h4>
<p>Every subscriber wins a prize, and some of those prizes are worth hundreds of pounds. The chance to win big prizes is not the only benefit, though. Every prize is accompanied by a fun postcard with information about the company that supplied the prize, explaining who they are, what they do and what their values are. In this way, subscribers get to learn about fantastic ethical and fair trade products and companies, expanding their knowledge of ethical consumerism and helping them make informed choices.<br/></p>
<h3>Why is it important?<br/>
</h3>
<p></p>Dip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah is designed to reward, educate, encourage and inspire people to make consumer choices that are beneficial not only to themselves, but also to others. By adding your support to the campaign you will help us achieve these aims. The price tag attached to the things we buy should never include exploitation or suffering, and together we can make sure resources and producers are respected and valued.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need <br/>
</h3>
<p>After much searching and some eye-watering quotes, we have found a brilliant web developer who is motivated by being part of projects he believes in, so he has agreed to do the entire build for the fantastic price of just £1,000.00!! <br/></p>
<p>Aside from the website, we need to have the terms and conditions for the website drawn up, which requires a solicitor. The cost of this will be £750.00</p>
<p></p>
<p>The business will largely hinge of marketing and PR. In order to move forward we really need to secure a minimum of two months' fees, which will total £3,000.00.<br/></p>
<p>If the final total comes in below the target, we will focus on creating as much of a buzz as possible with the funds available.<br/></p>

<p>The opportunity has presented itself for us to set up shop in the heart of beautiful Daylesford. We've quit our full-time jobs, found the perfect shop, completed our business plan and even confirmed some other artists to collaborate with in store.

<p>However, the bank has told us that we are too much of a risk for a business loan and have declined our application for initial funds to start our dream.

<p>So here's where you come in. We need a bit of cash to pay the rental bond, first two month's rent &amp; bills up front and to purchase some stock from our favourite artists to help fill out the store. The most expensive part is the initial cash outlay and the shop refurbishment, but once we're set up we have no doubt we will succeed. </p></span></div>
</div><div> We've written an extensive budget and worked out that realising our dream is going to cost us around $70,000.

<h3>Why I need your help</h3>
<p>I aim to bring a modern approach to my grandfather's work of providing accessible housing to people with low income. In order to bring this vision to fruition, I will need to build a model of the design I can offer to display the possibilities of aesthetics and practicality through green building techniques, sacred geometry design and intentional building. Though this vision is solid and on a strong foundation of ability and skill, I need your help! Despite solid motivation, I lack the resources to start, let alone complete, this project; as I cannot manifest this alone, I am asking for your assistance in achieving this dream.</p>
<h3>Who I am</h3>
<p>My name is Casey Attebery, and I am a father, carpenter, teacher, therapeutic sound-worker, scientist and dreamer. Throughout much of my life I have been one to strive to live and work in service to my community, which has mostly come in a day-to-day form. For several years I have had a dream of living in, and building for others, a tiny home in which to live in small communities; meanwhile, I have also been seeking ways to bring my passions through this body in ways to serve my greater community. I believe the answer is in building micro-campers for people in need of housing, using sacred geometry and intention in the design with green building techniques. This can also extend to custom builds, however I wish to begin a small business whose guiding principle is building practical and inexpensive portable living spaces. My goal with this campaign is to plant a seed to starting a small business that can grow with the community, and perhaps beyond, serving those in need along the way. I feel it is my time to set a solid foot into this Earth, to be a grounded example for my daughter, and the generations to come.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How I need your help</h3>
<p>The pictures shown here are of others' designs, but I believe practicality and aesthetic beauty can both be maximized under the heading ""inexpensive"". With the funds earned from this campaign, I will afford the materials needed for a model build. The estimated cost for a trailer, framing lumber, insulation, interior/exterior siding, windows/door, flooring, roofing, hardware, fixtures, shelving and storage is about $2,000. I am asking $1,500 for my time and labor, and an additional $500 for small-business startup costs.  If I don't make the full goal, I will still go as far into the build process that I can, and will manifest the fruition as soon as possible. However, if there are any additional funds remaining at the end of the project, they will go towards capital for the next build! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How I hope this will serve</h3>
<p>Along the build journey I will take photographs and reflect in a journal about the experience. This information, along with the final model, will serve as a foundation for a book I will write outlining the very simple steps and procedures for anyone to build their own eco-conscious micro-camper or gypsy wagon. I have researched many others' builds on tiny homes, and have consolidated a good list of things to do and things not to do, but I am sure I will still learn a lot in this first build. In the end I will reflect on any and all ways I can minimize building cost without a loss to practicality, aesthetics or function, and pass these tips on in the book. <br/><br/>With books to deliver and plans to unfold, I, along with whatever team manifests along the way, will forge forth with this vision to build adequate and accessible portable housing to the community. In addition, I envision along this path the offering of portable healing spaces, vending carts, meditation spaces, art nooks, and sound chambers.<br/><br/>I firmly believe not only in completing my goals with passion, but also at each possible moment exceeding those goals as they meet the calls of the community. Thus, in order to fully meet the purpose behind this project, I will be corresponding with local Community Action centers to try to develop a keen sense of what the needs and resources are in the community for portable housing. With a solid history of unique and custom projects, as well as having the drive to help make a difference, I am more than ready to meet this call.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>This campaign will run for 34 days, after which I will use the funds to purchase materials and build the model micro-camper. I am also interested in support by means of items/materials! Mostly, I am looking for a trailer (5'x8' or 4'x6' preferred), 2""x3"" lumber, RV windows/door, foam board insulation, siding, etc.</p>
<p>Any and all support is greatly appreciated! Please share this campaign as you're willing and able! Thank you :)</p>

In the end I will reflect on any and all ways I can minimize building cost without a loss to practicality, aesthetics or function, and pass these tips on in the book. With books to deliver and plans to unfold, I, along with whatever team manifests along the way, will forge forth with this vision to build adequate and accessible portable housing to the community. In addition, I envision along this path the offering of portable healing spaces, vending carts, meditation spaces, art nooks, and sound chambers.I firmly believe not only in completing my goals with passion, but also at each possible moment exceeding those goals as they meet the calls of the community. Thus, in order to fully meet the purpose behind this project, I will be corresponding with local Community Action centers to try to develop a keen sense of what the needs and resources are in the community for portable housing. With a solid history of unique and custom projects, as well as having the drive to help make a difference, I am more than ready to meet this call.

Other Ways You Can Help
This campaign will run for 34 days, after which I will use the funds to purchase materials and build the model micro-camper. I am also interested in support by means of items/materials! Mostly, I am looking for a trailer (5'x8' or 4'x6' preferred), 2""x3"" lumber, RV windows/door, foam board insulation, siding, etc.
Any and all support is greatly appreciated! Please share this campaign as you're willing and able! Thank you :)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Wynwood Yard is a culinary incubator. It’s a community of entrepreneurs who are passionate about their ideas and who are hustling to make their livelihoods in innovative ways.  Most days you can meet with them face-to- face here at the Yard as they prepare dishes and serve them to you or tend the garden. You can also meet arts, design and culture entrepreneurs as they forge ahead with their start-ups at The Wynwood Yard.  </p>
<p>The Yard has maintained an organic garden since its inception in November 2015. With major improvements coming on-line for the first-year anniversary, the garden is being expanded and improved.  The new educational demonstration garden will showcase sustainable, organic growing techniques in an urban setting.  In addition to providing produce and herbs for on-site culinary concepts, the garden will be home to urban farming classes, floral and art workshops, cooking classes and chef demos, and farm-to-table community dinners.</p>
<p>Muriel Olivares and Tiffany Noe, founders of Little River Cooperative, will be curating and tending to our new garden and making sure it’s thriving all year long with seasonal produce, edible flowers and herbs using sustainable farming methods. Here's what the amazing women of LRC have to say about their involvement with The Yard: </p>
<p>“Being part of The Wynwood Yard project has been so inspiring since the very beginning. When we showed up late last summer to revive the garden, it was just an abandoned-looking lot full of weeds and trash. Now it’s the most inspiring hub of entrepreneurial spirit, community involvement and delicious food in all of Miami. Our small farm business couldn’t be more proud to be a part of it all.” </p>

We strive for an intersectional feminist perspective on geek culture and cover comic books, movies, crowdfunding efforts, gaming, and more.The Geek Initiative has had a presence at over a dozen conventions including New York Comic Con and WonderCon.We host the popular “LARP Chat Live” on Blab and The Geek Initiative Podcast.What HappenedIn June of this year, The Geek Initiative sponsored three panels at Wizard World Comic Con Philadelphia (Wizard World Philly) in an effort to contribute to a more inclusive atmosphere. Our panels were listed in the “40(!) Can’t-Miss Panels When Wizard World Invades Philly This Week.” They were:
The Big Two on the Big Screen: Do DC and Marvel Do Enough?
Communities of Color: Why People of Color Need Our Own Space in Geek Communities and How to Find or Create These Spaces
What I Learned by Giving Kids Swords: LARP Life Lessons from Really Smart Kids
During our Communities of Color panel on Saturday, our website went down. With the help of our web host, we determined that it was a hack. Google currently lists the site as potentially hacked as well.We have backups of the files, but our site’s formatting is gone and we need to re-do it with some increased security measures to ensure this doesn’t happen again.What Steps We Have TakenWe assessed the damage and costs. We polled our community about whether it was worth it to continue - even though we knew we wanted to. We were met with a resounding ‘yes.’We reached out to a network specifically designed to assist with these situations (twice), but we did not receive a response or any aid from them.Crowdfunding this effort is our final option.How We Can Fix ItWe are poised to re-do the site. Our editorial staff and contributors can do most of the work in-house. However, we need to install additional security measures to ensure the stability and security of our website. We have secured pro bono aid from a certified technical expert.Emergency CostsThese emergency costs have been provided to us by GoDaddy, our editorial team, and our web tech expert.

Emergency contingency fund for additional hack attempts or tech support requirements: $350
WhoIs / ICANN privacy for site owner’s security: $30/year
WordFence security plugin: $50/5 years
Budget to pay contributors and editors: $500
$1814 + $91 (5% Indiegogo Fee) = $1905Stretch Goals: Maintenance Costs for 2017Total maintenance costs for May 2017-May 2018--
SSL Certificate, SiteLock, ongoing tech support, emergency fund, ICANN = $1264
Payment for contributors: $500

<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Expanding his reach...</h3> <p></p>
<p>Many of those who have had Josh's cooking said he should expand his
operation to allow his food to inspire others on a larger scale. Well—the time
has come!</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The business name is
as much of a name <b><i>as it is a mantra</i></b>. The name in its essence has a dual
meaning. First, Josh’s passion for all things ‘craft’ (especially craft beer) would
have to shine in his new venture. Being a 'craft BBQ' caterer will allow him to produce more creative menus than what the traditional BBQ caters currently in the market can do. Think of this as the 'craft brewery' version of a catering business. This format will allow Josh's skillfulness and creative outlook
to shine.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></span></p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Speaking of being creative...Josh takes his love for culinary innovation and craft beer by blending the two in his home brewery. In the past few years he has crafted various key lime goses, a roasted mandarin orange and vanilla mead, tart cherry wild ales using wine must, and his favorite--a pineapple habanero red ale. In what spare time he has, Josh creates both meads and ales for his 'members only' reserve club that allows members up to 8 different styles ranging from 375ml to 750ml, many with a caged and corked presentation. He also has brewed beers as favors for two weddings last year. Needless to say...food and beer are his 'thing.'</span></p>
<p>Lastly, BBQ can mean many things ranging from low and slow cooking techniques to hot and fast live fire cooking. True Craft BBQ will be focusing on both. The primary function of the business is to cook most, if not all, of its food over live coals. This ranges from steaks &amp; burgers to slow smoked brisket and even desserts. The sky is the limit when you have a coal driven pit at your disposal!</p>
<p>So today, we bring to
you the merging of two passions: <b>True Craft BBQ.</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;"">Why 'craft' BBQ?</span></p>
</div><div>
<div>Starting a 'craft' catering and events business will allow Josh to serve (pun intended) a segment of the market that is generally overlooked by many caterers. The catering concept will serve smaller events (40-60 people) and focus on food inspired by its surroundings. Whether it's putting a Florida spin on classic Texas BBQ or crafting a beer and food pairing menu for a local brewery, the catering concept will be unlike any others in the Tampa Bay Area. There will be a huge emphasis on 'cooked on site' so that all attendees can take part and watch how dishes are transformed from standard 'center-of-the-plate' meals to something that will be remembered. </div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">By keeping the operation small at first, the food and overall experience can be tailored to any client large or small. While larger events are doable, the menus would be more fixed and traditional in nature, something akin to a BBQ picnic. We are aiming for a higher-level of thought for our food. Our goal is to keep events smaller so that we can run wild with awesome menus that will have people wanting more.</span></div>

<h3>What we need</h3>
<p>If you know Josh, you
should know he doesn’t do anything without putting 110% effort into it. True
Craft BBQ will be a first class catering business with no detail overlooked.
Startup costs for a new venture like this are relatively low compared to larger
operations like a food truck. However, while serving BBQ at events and parties
sounds simple—it’s actually pretty involved to do everything 'right' and by Florida food service standards.</p>
<p>Intangibles such as
the logo design, website and social media properties have been secured with
help from local designer/artist/architect Alex Andreakos. We are in the beginning stages of getting the tangibles lined up.</p>
<p>With your help, True
Craft BBQ will not be a fly-by night brand—but a brand you will want to proudly
display at your next event or party. We have started the planning to acquire
most of the list below…but your help is needed to get us up and running sooner than later.</p>

Josh has been cooking
and serving innovative, BBQ-inspired food since buying his first Big Green Egg

<p style=""margin-left:25.1pt;text-align: center;""><strong><i>We find and offer reliable high &amp; low-cost</i></strong> <strong><i>individual</i></strong><strong><i> or </i></strong><strong><i>group</i></strong><strong><i> passenger</i></strong> <strong><i>transport options for particular destinations.</i></strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:25.1pt;text-align: center;""><strong><i>We also enable transporters to get in touch with passengers.</i></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476396605/mhefpkpztgxyvzx12e2v.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>The original meaning of the word shuttle is the device used in weaving to carry the weft. By reference to the continual to-and-from motion associated with that, the term was then applied in transportation.</i></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>Personal Experiences</strong></u></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The last time I took a ride service, was from the Luton airport to the center of London, with quite a bit of luggage that got me sweating by just thinking about going on a crowded bus in the morning, and then train, and then the subway in a worst case scenario. Oh, and I almost forgot about walking with all the luggage in between. Bus + walking + The underground would be a best case public transport scenario I guess. I mean traveling can already be exhausting just with the jet lag, luggage, and haste.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Also whenever traveling in a larger city, there is always some fear present of getting lost with the public transport somehow. Wouldn't be the first time.<br/>Therefore I and a designer working on the project opted for a private transfer, out of at least 20+ providers operating in London that I found on the web, I checked maybe 5 ? The nonsense of filling out destination, the number of people traveling and time forms over and over again for each provider separately, wasting valuable time and waiting for the replies and confirmations for the transfer... really ? Isn't it 2016 ? Come on, chop chop, there's gotta be a quicker and easier way, no ?</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">So I decided to check what Uber though about my need for transport. <span>£</span>48 and no promise for a guaranteed ride. Ok then. And BlaBlaCar can't operate on airports... bummer.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477160038/yxvuxybpvnigpxobhjsy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Decided to make a booking that was guaranteed with a local company, the price was <span>£</span>50. The driver was waiting for us at the airport, the ride was pleasant and comfortable, the luggage fit nicely in the trunk and there was still room in the car for at least 2 more + luggage, that got me thinking again, of just those flights that landed around the same time as ours, there are numerous people also going to the center of London... but I couldn't just pull their sleeve and ask them if they'd like to join, and it would cost them just 16 pounds or less per person for a shared door to door ride for sure. Of course not, there are social rules in existence and we do not do that.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> It would probably be easier if we'd be able to do that online, where there's no fear of getting in an awkward situation with a random stranger.<br/>At least not right off the bat ;)</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">From our experience in transport and rent-a-car, there's a lot of logistics and planning needed to properly execute a great on-demand passenger transfer. Finding the cheapest or quickest possible route, calculating the time taking all the possible setbacks into account, and finding the best possible fuel price on long distance routes, especially in Europe (Yes, we're looking at you Norway and Netherlands). Even with electric and self-driving cars, there are a few things we can do better.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">If using shared transport the algorithms we are implementing will help you connect with travelers all over the world that share the time and destination trips, so you can share the trip expenses, yet you still get to keep the professionalism, insurances, and treatment of a customer along with the experience of traveling with other people just like yourself.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Bring along your pets, skis, bikes, or if you need a transportation service adapted for people with disabilities, we'll find it for you. Shuttle Planet will offer you on-demand shared and private transfers on your travels. Anywhere you go.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Your time is valuable when you are planning a trip or a holiday, and we know of all the things you have to think about. Save your time in planning on how to get to your destination and rather focus on what you'll be doing on the actual destination.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u>The Green Incentive</u></strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Intentional or not, by carpooling you will help lower the emissions produced by fossil fueled vehicles. Trees are responsible for absorbing a fifth of man's climate change emissions, and our forests are in crisis.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The world has lost half its natural forests – and only a tenth of what’s left is protected. Every year we lose another 130,000 square km – that’s an area the size of England. Cutting down all those trees is speeding up climate change.</strong></p>

Allowing the insight about passenger statistics for companies, giving them the ability to optimize their routes and vehicles to further reduce the price to the passenger, while simultaneously increasing revenue and profit, creating a win-win situation for both the customer and the transport provider.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Also increasing the value of local communities with new businesses, creating new real jobs and by advertising, not just the inexhaustible hidden gems and destinations sought out by explorers in their respective countries, but also showing the ease, price, and availability of getting there.</p>

Company Mission
We find and offer reliable high & low-cost individual or group passenger transport options for particular destinations.
We also enable transporters to get in touch with passengers.
 

The original meaning of the word shuttle is the device used in weaving to carry the weft. By reference to the continual to-and-from motion associated with that, the term was then applied in transportation.
Personal Experiences
The last time I took a ride service, was from the Luton airport to the center of London, with quite a bit of luggage that got me sweating by just thinking about going on a crowded bus in the morning, and then train, and then the subway in a worst case scenario. Oh, and I almost forgot about walking with all the luggage in between. Bus + walking + The underground would be a best case public transport scenario I guess. I mean traveling can already be exhausting just with the jet lag, luggage, and haste.
Also whenever traveling in a larger city, there is always some fear present of getting lost with the public transport somehow. Wouldn't be the first time.Therefore I and a designer working on the project opted for a private transfer, out of at least 20+ providers operating in London that I found on the web, I checked maybe 5 ? The nonsense of filling out destination, the number of people traveling and time forms over and over again for each provider separately, wasting valuable time and waiting for the replies and confirmations for the transfer... really ? Isn't it 2016 ? Come on, chop chop, there's gotta be a quicker and easier way, no ?
So I decided to check what Uber though about my need for transport. £48 and no promise for a guaranteed ride. Ok then. And BlaBlaCar can't operate on airports... bummer.

Decided to make a booking that was guaranteed with a local company, the price was £50. The driver was waiting for us at the airport, the ride was pleasant and comfortable, the luggage fit nicely in the trunk and there was still room in the car for at least 2 more + luggage, that got me thinking again, of just those flights that landed around the same time as ours, there are numerous people also going to the center of London... but I couldn't just pull their sleeve and ask them if they'd like to join, and it would cost them just 16 pounds or less per person for a shared door to door ride for sure. Of course not, there are social rules in existence and we do not do that.
 It would probably be easier if we'd be able to do that online, where there's no fear of getting in an awkward situation with a random stranger.At least not right off the bat ;)
              
Tell us what bugs you most on your travels ? Is it the search for transport, the waiting, prices ? Or is it just the weather every now and then ?

What will you be able to find on shuttleplanet.com ?
Most importantly - carpooling and economical group traveling. A web platform and mobile application for passenger road transport, specialized in on-demand travel, either private or shared.
Through a seamless experience travel to sightseeing points, hotels, airports, get daily commute rides and more. You'll be able to search and choose from private & VIP transfers, rent-a-cars, and our pride and joy system - shared transfers.

Only the top third of the front page is in the picture*


From our experience in transport and rent-a-car, there's a lot of logistics and planning needed to properly execute a great on-demand passenger transfer. Finding the cheapest or quickest possible route, calculating the time taking all the possible setbacks into account, and finding the best possible fuel price on long distance routes, especially in Europe (Yes, we're looking at you Norway and Netherlands). Even with electric and self-driving cars, there are a few things we can do better.
If using shared transport the algorithms we are implementing will help you connect with travelers all over the world that share the time and destination trips, so you can share the trip expenses, yet you still get to keep the professionalism, insurances, and treatment of a customer along with the experience of traveling with other people just like yourself.
Bring along your pets, skis, bikes, or if you need a transportation service adapted for people with disabilities, we'll find it for you. Shuttle Planet will offer you on-demand shared and private transfers on your travels. Anywhere you go.
Your time is valuable when you are planning a trip or a holiday, and we know of all the things you have to think about. Save your time in planning on how to get to your destination and rather focus on what you'll be doing on the actual destination.

How will it work ?

 
The Green Incentive
Intentional or not, by carpooling you will help lower the emissions produced by fossil fueled vehicles. Trees are responsible for absorbing a fifth of man's climate change emissions, and our forests are in crisis.
The world has lost half its natural forests – and only a tenth of what’s left is protected. Every year we lose another 130,000 square km – that’s an area the size of England. Cutting down all those trees is speeding up climate change.
Data source: Reconstruction from ice cores.Credit: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

In that regard, we will be donating 10% of any pledge of 25$ and above to The Woodland Trust, in order to help them maintain, restore and protect our trees and woodlands.

For Businesses
Our values are that every company's priority should be to bring value to people above anything else.
We will provide any passenger transport company or even sole proprietors the ability to compete with today's boom of ""ridesharing"" startups, to not just survive, but to increase their profit while simultaneously reduce prices for the passenger. Allowing the insight about passenger statistics for companies, giving them the ability to optimize their routes and vehicles to further reduce the price to the passenger, while simultaneously increasing revenue and profit, creating a win-win situation for both the customer and the transport provider.
Also increasing the value of local communities with new businesses, creating new real jobs and by advertising, not just the inexhaustible hidden gems and destinations sought out by explorers in their respective countries, but also showing the ease, price, and availability of getting there.
Simplifying the way we search for transport be it shared, private, or even extravagant, and if desired, giving us the ability to share the expenses of road transport.
And we also understand that your business is yours, and we'll keep it that way ;)

 Crowdsourcing & Crowdfunding rides

<h3>Why?</h3>

<h3><span style=""font-size: 24px;letter-spacing: 0px;"">What do we need? </span></h3>
<p>The full cost to complete our renovation and upgrade project is $17,000.  To ensure we can complete this project, we plan on putting in a lot of our own sweat to deliver these enhancements! <strong>We have actually ALREADY secured financing for 50% of this project</strong>: HOPA is self-financing $1,000, a private donor has already pledged $1,000,  and our vendor friends who will be executing the various items have generously pledged a whopping $6,500 of pro-bono support!  <u><strong>So now, we're seeking the community's help to complete the last 50% or $8,500 of funding needed to complete the renovations!</strong></u></p>

""One day... I will own this shop"",  said a young five year-old Clayton. As the shop owner looked down on the energetic boy he could see the fixed determination in the boy's eyes and could feel an immense loving spirit spilling from his little body.
Little Clayton grew up to become ""Uncle Clay"". He made good on his dream. He took all he had and threw himself into running the humble crack seed and candy shop ""Doe Fang"" nestled in the quiet lush valley of ʻĀina Haina, Oahu.
From 1996, Uncle Clay grew into a beloved figure of the community, serving his sweet treats seven days a week and spreading Pure Aloha with everyone he met.  Yet, the small business struggled, but Uncle Clay never wavered. 
Eventually, rising rents and shifting economic conditions had drained all of the earthly resources Uncle Clay had. But his spirit of Pure Aloha and his love for every guest, neighbor, and friend never cracked. 
Just when it seemed there was no choice and Uncle Clay was being forced to close the doors to his dreams, his nephew, Bronson, stepped in.
With the same love and spirit of his Uncle, Bronson took Uncle Clay around the shoulders, ""This dream is too important. We can't give up"".
Bronson had a vision and a plan. Uncle Clay's mission to bring our entire One World 'Ohana took a new medium: all-natural, homemade, and handcrafted shave ice. 
Bronson heroically rallied family, friends, and patrons, to launch the reimagined vision: Uncle Clay's House of Pure Aloha or ""HOPA"".

1) In-House Renovations

redesigning and relocating menu boards for better presentation and easier ordering

handcrafting a brand new ""One World 'Ohana"" bench from a single 16-foot Monkeypod wood slab
handcrafting FIVE new Monkeypod wood fixed tabletops 
handcrafting TEN natural Hawaiian log stools

Overall, these furniture upgrades will serve both form and function.  These new furniture installations have been meticulously chosen to both maximize House space while providing an incredibly beautiful natural environment for guests to enjoy.

Team ESLENA here, as you may already know, we are the creators of a certified organic, lemon ginger infused still water. We love our drink, the support we're getting from our local community, and the super cool feedback that we've heard from so many of you. Since our launch in November of 2015, our sales have consistently grown, and because of that track record (and requests from our current customers!), it’s time to grow our brand by rolling out new flavors and work to get this healthy, enhanced water into more hands. <strong>That’s why we need you! </strong>Your support will give us the financial backing we need to kick our business into the next stratosphere by funding the production of 2 new flavors and allowing us to offer nationwide shipping. <strong>Why now? </strong>These flavors make us more attractive to grocery stores, coffee shops and bars because more flavors means more shelf space and more shelf space means more attention from consumers. All of which will results in more sales, which allows us to continue doing what we love - producing a truly healthy, enhanced water that makes you feel good - and is fun to drink! We created this drink for those looking for an alternative to the overly sugared, overly caffeinated, artificial and carbonated waters currently out there.

<h3>We are scientists who see a positive and diverse future for Alberta and for Canada. </h3>
<p>We are former colleagues who studied science together in university and became long-time friends who believe that the conversation around energy in Canada is polarized.</p>
<p>We are passionate believers in candid and open discussion. It is our hope that ENERGYminute will engage Canadians to have meaningful dialog that is constructive around energy and energy policy. </p>
<p>There are big questions out there across the political spectrum:</p>
<ul>
<li>How long will a shift to renewable energy take? 10 years? 50 years? 100?</li>
<li>How do global energy markets impact us in Canada?</li>
<li>Are electric cars actually coming and what are the benefits? Are there any consequences?</li>
<li>If we want to meet emissions goals - what is the most likely energy source to get us there?</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>The progression of diversifying energy supply is important for Canada, but the discussion around our future can be a polarizing one.  We would like to create short, concise videos about energy that are interesting and easily digestible so that every Canadian can be properly informed, infographics, and reach out to energy workers in all sectors for informational interviews.

</div></div>","We are scientists who see a positive and diverse future for Alberta and for Canada. 
We are former colleagues who studied science together in university and became long-time friends who believe that the conversation around energy in Canada is polarized.
We are passionate believers in candid and open discussion. It is our hope that ENERGYminute will engage Canadians to have meaningful dialog that is constructive around energy and energy policy. 
There are big questions out there across the political spectrum:

How long will a shift to renewable energy take? 10 years? 50 years? 100?
How do global energy markets impact us in Canada?
Are electric cars actually coming and what are the benefits? Are there any consequences?
If we want to meet emissions goals - what is the most likely energy source to get us there?


The progression of diversifying energy supply is important for Canada, but the discussion around our future can be a polarizing one.  We would like to create short, concise videos about energy that are interesting and easily digestible so that every Canadian can be properly informed, infographics, and reach out to energy workers in all sectors for informational interviews. We will post them on Facebook, YouTube, our website, and send them to bloggers, and other media outlets across our country.

<h3>JOIN THE MOVEMENT TODAY</h3>
<p>To push innovation and creativity in Vancouver WA and help the coworking community build out a new, larger location in the heart of Vancouver WA. By helping one small business, you help hundreds more.  </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Columbia Collective is.. </h3>
<p> A small business resource, and the first  coworking community in Vancouver WA. A collective of diverse companies, freelancers, remote workers, non-profits and other creative individuals, all working under one roof. Started by two regular dudes who couldn’t find a good shared office environment and refused to waste time commuting to Portland. They saw a need and decided to make it happen. Once they launched Columbia Collective it grew rapidly from 2 to 50 members, and it's continuing to grow. They quickly outgrew their first space and so, decided to make a move to a larger, more open facility, a place that can have an even bigger impact on our economy here in Vancouver. </p>
<p>At Columbia Collective you get.. </p>
<ul>
<li>Flex desks, lounges, and a myriad of different working areas</li>
<li>Choose to work sitting or standing with out sit/stand electronic desks or many bars. </li>
<li>Conference rooms, meeting areas, and phone booths. </li>
<li>Private offices, a kitchen, and a reading corner. </li>
<li>Business social and networking events. </li>
<li>Your choice of coffee, espresso machine, drip and more. </li>
<li>Beer on tap.</li>
<li>Ping Pong, Bike rack.</li>
<li>Mini Photo studio.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most importantly it's a place where there is an open and supportive community for entrepreneurs to be able to go and fulfill their dreams, and do what they love, in a constructive and collaborative way.  </p>

With a sense of purpose and a job we can eliminate 3 evils:  boredom, vice, and poverty. How we're going to get thereWe're creating a non-profit!  100% of the funds will be used to open the doors of our sanctuary, create jobs for our Veterans and help them find healing through a dog's loving companionship.We're looking to raise $50,000.  Specifically, this will go toward:1) Help pay for initial legal fees as we set up our non-profit designation.2) Acquiring a property that's well suited for the sanctuary and a place where Veterans can come to get support and connection. (The sanctuary will be an indoor/outdoor facility and we'll need a relatively good sized yard as well as enough space to house dogs overnight for those who are blessing us for more than one day.)3) Help finance the first 6 months of expenses.We are asking for your help. Together we can change the lives of our Veterans in more ways than they can imagine. Help us raise the funding to accelerate the opening our first dog daycare sanctuary. Join our generous community, help raise funds and awareness, and come with us on this incredible journey!Please pledge and consider contributing. Your contributions will go straight to making this project happen.  Every dollar counts in taking us a step closer.

<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, my Name is Stephen Itiakorit, a community Solutions program leader from Uganda. I bring 9 years of  Livelihood work with civil society to this project along being a Visionary Entrepreneur,Mentor and a vocalist in Uganda, Africa.  </p>
<p>As the government of Uganda together with Her development Partners is making strides in Improving Education Sector, my country has registered steady progress in quality and quantity of education leading a steep rise of 62% graduate employment. Estimates from Uganda Investment Authority indicate that 250,000 graduates are unemployed annually. This  has a huge influence of social and economic relationships making youth more vulnerable to poor working conditions, low wages, frustration and stigma as well as drug and alcohol abuse. Also because many are at home after graduation this is a discouragement to others in the education pipeline.</p>
<p>With the establishment of a social enterprise , I am convinced of  us building together with youth a local understanding of overcoming unemployement  for youth to use their talents credibility, share gifts to better their world, and be empowered to start up and manage business in a supportive, safe and Positive environment. The social enterprise will consist of a coffee shop with complimentary Wi-Fi and fresh graduate will work in shifts through Mobile coffee bike, Cart, Van and other aspects of the business with hands business management  mentorship and this business as well will serve as a social environment for them to work, hangout with friends and discuss ideas and opportunities.

<h3><strong>Short Summary</strong></h3>
<p>Hi! I am Denise Muniz, Chief Alpha Dog, of Bad Dog Bistro. I have spent the past 10+ years as a nonprofit fundraising executive for various healthcare organizations and have successfully raised more than $50 million for these organizations. Previous to my nonprofit career, I worked in banking as a client manager, managing a $75 million client portfolio. Although I have had a very gratifying career, I have such a love and passion for both dogs &amp; cooking that I knew I had something more to offer. When I discovered my current organization was going through a major consolidation, I decided it was time to pursue my dreams. My experience in banking and as a business executive will allow me to successfully run a business with fiscal transparency, strong projections, and a strategic business plan.</p>
<p>A few months ago, my 6-month old German Shepherd, Moose, stopped eating the commercial dog food I was feeding him. I was desperate to get him to eat, as he was too skinny, so I was left to get creative. I tried all types of commercial dog food (dry, wet, ""fresh""), but nothing worked. He didn't want any of it. I also have a senior Pitbull/Border Collie mix, Guinness, who really never liked eating and was also underweight. Meanwhile, Bud (another senior mixed breed) would scarf up Moose &amp; Guinness' food the minute I turned my back. Bud was becoming really obese, and my other dogs were too skinny.</p>
<p>Desperate for a solution, I started searching the internet for answers &amp; decided that I would cook food for all of my dogs. The change was immediate &amp; amazing! All three dogs are so excited for their meals that I have to gate them out of the kitchen while I make their food. When I open the gate, it's a race to their bowls. Truly amazing! Bud is no longer obese, and both Moose &amp; Guinness are back to normal weight. There are other notable changes. They drink only a third of the water they used to, as they are getting water from food. Also, they are digesting more food with the result being less poo!</p>
<p>Seeing all of the positive effects homemade, all-natural dog food was having on my dogs helped me see there was a need to provide all-natural, homemade food to other dogs and Bad Dog Bistro was born. Along with the Bad Dog Bistro mobile Dog House, we will also be offering a monthly subscription service within the Greater Los Angeles Area that includes home delivery. My goal is a world filled with healthier, happier dogs! Good dogs are boring, and bad dogs need good food!</p>

Hi! I am Denise Muniz, Chief Alpha Dog, of Bad Dog Bistro. I have spent the past 10+ years as a nonprofit fundraising executive for various healthcare organizations and have successfully raised more than $50 million for these organizations. Previous to my nonprofit career, I worked in banking as a client manager, managing a $75 million client portfolio. Although I have had a very gratifying career, I have such a love and passion for both dogs & cooking that I knew I had something more to offer. When I discovered my current organization was going through a major consolidation, I decided it was time to pursue my dreams. My experience in banking and as a business executive will allow me to successfully run a business with fiscal transparency, strong projections, and a strategic business plan.
A few months ago, my 6-month old German Shepherd, Moose, stopped eating the commercial dog food I was feeding him. I was desperate to get him to eat, as he was too skinny, so I was left to get creative. I tried all types of commercial dog food (dry, wet, ""fresh""), but nothing worked. He didn't want any of it. I also have a senior Pitbull/Border Collie mix, Guinness, who really never liked eating and was also underweight. Meanwhile, Bud (another senior mixed breed) would scarf up Moose & Guinness' food the minute I turned my back. Bud was becoming really obese, and my other dogs were too skinny.
Desperate for a solution, I started searching the internet for answers & decided that I would cook food for all of my dogs. The change was immediate & amazing! All three dogs are so excited for their meals that I have to gate them out of the kitchen while I make their food. When I open the gate, it's a race to their bowls. Truly amazing! Bud is no longer obese, and both Moose & Guinness are back to normal weight. There are other notable changes. They drink only a third of the water they used to, as they are getting water from food. Also, they are digesting more food with the result being less poo!
Seeing all of the positive effects homemade, all-natural dog food was having on my dogs helped me see there was a need to provide all-natural, homemade food to other dogs and Bad Dog Bistro was born. Along with the Bad Dog Bistro mobile Dog House, we will also be offering a monthly subscription service within the Greater Los Angeles Area that includes home delivery.

<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>We are a group of young professionals with more than 15 years of experience in the tourism sector. After launching a successful boutique digital agency for the travel and tourism industry we noticed something was missing. Puerto Rico and the Caribbean was in need of new tourism product. On 2015, Local Guest was conceived as an idea for economic development, a new digital platform that curates tourism experiences and connects travelers to genuine experience hosts. We want to diversify Puerto Rico’s tourism product and foster economic development but on September 20th, 2017 Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico and brought great devastation so the team has decided to shift its goal toward relief efforts. </p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Local Guest team is developing a Three Phase Relief effort to rebuild a new sustainable Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>1. Relief: We will work on providing food, clean water and cleaning crews to hard-hit communities that haven't received any aid. Create mobile food-drives, clean key streets for safe passage and provide medical attentions to families that have loss greatly after the Category 4 hurricane hit. </p>
<p>2. Sustainability: Provide educational workshop for the sustentable growth of the community. Some would include: health, nutrition, CPR, survival skills, meditation, dealing with PTSD, solar power, recycling, home gardens, and so on. </p>
<p>2. Bloom: We will provide new sustainable tourism experiences in conjunction with voluntourism opportunities for travelers seeking ways to help and connect with communities. </p>
<p>These new travelers seek inspiration and the opportunity to help and a bit of self-discovery in everything they do.  Experience tourism is not just born from the need to evolve beyond mass tourism and create an authentic connection to the destination, but is also based on the sustainable development of everybody involved and the strengthening of communities.</p>
<p>Our hosts are passionate experts that are eager to showcase our beautiful island. </p>

<p>Our business model uses as a starting point the development of experiences in island municipalities with the most distressing poverty levels. In conjunction with the area host, we seek to develop authentically local tourism experiences that stimulate visitor traffic and generate employment. With your contribution we will be able to provide relief efforts, long-term sustainability and new economic development for the island. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need funding to be able to deploy our relief efforts as soon as possible. People need our help and are desesperate for a ray of hope. </p>
<p>What we will use our money for:</p>
<p>- Food: non-perishable and prepared food will be delivered. We are also buying crops from local farmers that have to sell before they go bad and to help them rebuild</p>
<p>- Water: Cases of bottled water</p>
<p>- Gas/Diesel: To move our trucks to hard to reach areas</p>
<p>- Biodegradable plates and utensils to diminish the waste and bio-waste </p>
<p>- Professional: Any professional personal we may need to efficiently provide aid</p>
<p>All of our perks are experience related, check them out!</p>
<p>Even if we don't reach our goal the funding will be allocated to mostly food and water. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

The world needs sustainable tourism were locals and travelers interact to broaden their horizons and create bridges for the future. </p>
<p>Please donate and help us in rebuilding a better Puerto Rico for the future. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our main challenges are the political and financial uncertainty of the island but with projects like Local Guest we know we can generate a foundation for hands on, proactive relief. Since the beginning of this project we have been in contact with industry stakeholders (hoteliers, small inns, DMC, associations, tourism boards, and so on) and local non-profits that will ensure a more seamless and less burocratic way of bringing aid direclty to those who need it.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to read about my business venture. A little about me and what qualifies me for this company.</p>
<p>I have worked at a local cat rescue the past year doing care taking, working the foster program and helping with advocacy in the community to make our shelters no kill. While we have had great success, there are still cats being euthanized daily that are adoptable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My dream is to open a Cat Café Wine Bar. This will be a great place to relax and enjoy the company of cats that have been rescued from the local shelters. My goal is to get cats off the euthanasia list that are adoptable and give them a second chance in an open adoption area. They will live here and be loved and pampered by fellow cat lovers in the community while the humans relax and unwind with wine. I will offer adoptions as well as foster opportunities. This will be unlike any other cat café and also help the community by rescuing more cats that may not have had a chance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In order to make this dream work, there will be two parts to my business. One will be the for profit wine bar and the other will be a non-profit cat adoption center. First, building needs to be funded, the rest is easy but I CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT YOU!</p>

GDF initiates and promotes dialogue among communities to support improving lives, particularly in developing countries. GDF is Associated with DPI (UN), works in collaboration with UN Alliance of Civilizations, local governments and businesses around the world to strengthen the citizen sector and build intercultural,  inclusive and sustainable societies.<br/><br/>This campaign aims to build a primary healthcare centre in Longiro, which is located in the Western Lopit Mountains, South Sudan - a peaceful, yet undeveloped area. Lopit community members (20) now living in Australia have outlined and are implementing an action plan, starting with the goal to end avoidable death and suffering for mothers and children during birth.<br/><br/>The mortality rate in the Lopit Mountains is currently 1 out of 7 women during childbirth, and 35% of children before  reaching age 5. Your contribution will significantly lower this rate.<br/><br/> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>The Lopit community needs $60,000 to buy the materials and an ambulance and to build the centre. Here's a breakdown of the equipment needed for this phase:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>$35, 000 - Construction materials<br/>Cement, iron sheets, timbers, wheelbarrow, metal spades, roofing nails, big nails,  doors, H2 water tanks, fencing and barbed wire, jembe, axe, hammer, panga, tables, jerrycans, plastic bags, generators, iron bars, racks, agricultural water tube, digging bars, solar panels &amp; equipment, tape measure, hand-saw, paint, pipes, fittings, <br/>
</li>
<li>$3,000 - Transport of materials (from Kenya and Uganda)  <br/>
</li>
<li>$12,000 - Construction labor<br/>
</li>
<li>$10,000 - Ambulance<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In case of not reaching our entire goal, the funds will go towards each of the next stages of the healthcare center construction. E.g., the bricks are ready and land (500mtrs X 450mtrs) is allocated. The next stage  is to buy the cement and build the center. Then the roof.. etc.,  and we will continue, using all funds received to build each of the next stages. <br/><br/>If the funds received exceed the target, then we will proceed with Stage 2, which is to construct a classroom for primary education in Longiro. Approximately 200 children are currently learning English in an outdoor classroom.<br/> <br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Primarily, you will help reduce the mortality rate. However, we anticipate your contribution support development in the Lopit Mountain region. This includes reducing the mortality rate for all 57 villages in the region, building schools, establishing rehabilitation centers for people suffering from Leprosy, developing farming and agriculture to improve food security and establish financial sustainability. <br/></p>
<p>Several NGO's are operating aid projects in the Lopit Mountains. These include UNICEF, Save The Children, Norwegian Church Aid and Association for Aid &amp; Relief, Japan. Your contribution will encourage and help to stimulate all efforts.<br/></p>
<p>By contributing, you will play an important role in helping save and give life to people in the Lopit. </p>
<p><br/></p> <ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>The violence that erupted on 15 December 2013 between armed forces
loyal to President Salva Kiir and armed forces loyal to Former Vice President Riek
Machar in Juba, the capital city of South Sudan, has resulted in numerous challenges
to government programs, including reform of the country's poor healthcare
system.</p>
<p>Despite making significant gains in promoting awareness of
health and wellness in South Sudan, preventable diseases remain a serious
issue. Malaria is one of the country's biggest problems, with thousands of
children dying daily from this treatable disease. Although rates of HIV and
AIDS infection have slowed in recent years, many families are impacted by these
serious conditions. <br/></p>
<p>Also poor sanitation in the  Lopit Mountain areas and the lack of
affordable medication further contributes to the spread of disease, and many women
and children do not have access to even basic medical treatment.</p>A key challenge will be to provide  trained healthcare  staff and/ or volunteers on the ground. Although there's lots of goodwill for providing this support, it is yet to be confirmed. <br/><p></p>
<p>Another challenge will be to ensure that equipment shipped can be used and ongoing supply sustained. Plans to develop agriculture as a means for building sustainability are also in the initiative stage.<br/></p>
<p>The exciting aspect though is that this project is being driven and implemented by the Lopit Community itself. Primarily, it is their 'determination' driving it forward to help their motherland.<br/></p>
<p>For at least a couple of years, the Lopit Community in Australia has been building its network, presenting the situation to various organisations and is receiving ongoing support. As a result of these efforts in 2012, a 40' container of supplies was loaded in Melbourne and shipped to the Lopit Mountains. It contained: 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Clothing for children and adults </li>
<li>Shoes, boots and sandals</li>
<li>Food items (including rice, lentils, milk powder, beans, tuna, oil, sugar; wheat flour; other non-perishable goods)</li>
<li>Medical supplies</li>
<li>Kitchenware (cooking utensils and pots, bowls and cups)</li>
<li>Bedding (sheets and blankets)</li>
<li>Cloth/fabric (of any sort, that can be made into clothing)</li>
<li>Mosquito nets</li>
<li>Sewing machines (treadle machines, not electric)</li>
<li>Organic seed for grain and vegetable crops</li>
<li>Hand tools for agriculture and also for building</li>
<li>Soap</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, visit <a href=""https://hnhproject.wordpress.com/page/3/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://hnhproject.wordpress.com/page/3/</a>
</p>The Lopit Community in Australia raised an initial $8,000 and sent 3 representatives to the Lopit area to assess the situation and return with their findings. This entire project is based on moving in the direction of development as determined by the Lopit people, and coupled with support garnered in Australia and partnerships established with international organisations, are major factors for overcoming these and other hurdles along the way.<br/><br/>A variety of approaches for solving these challenges and saving lives in Lopit region include:<br/><ul>
<li>Major health interventions will work even in the poorest remote areas of Lopit by building healthcare and schools facilities across the region and train members of Lopit community to manage the system and Providing universal healthcare access to all women and children.</li>
<li>Involvement of volunteers from around the world will play significant role in lowering mortality rate in the peaceful region of Lopit Mountain. Your involvement as a volunteer is very important to set a good example that will lead to success for  locals to follow.</li>
<li>Introduction of programs in many forms, e.g, health awareness, workshops across the region and adequate funding from both international and local sources for improving women and children’s access to healthcare and education. </li>
<li>Good management on the ground and effective use of information will decrease the risk of infection to slow down the spread and decreasing vulnerability to reduce risk and impact. Sustainable Donor funding will save lives and money</li>
<li>Partnerships with Lopit community, NGOs, and private companies can be powerful.<br/>

Lopit community members (20) now living in Australia have outlined and are implementing an action plan, starting with the goal to end avoidable death and suffering for mothers and children during birth.The mortality rate in the Lopit Mountains is currently 1 out of 7 women during childbirth, and 35% of children before  reaching age 5. Your contribution will significantly lower this rate.   What We Need & What You GetThe Lopit community needs $60,000 to buy the materials and an ambulance and to build the centre. Here's a breakdown of the equipment needed for this phase:
$35, 000 - Construction materialsCement, iron sheets, timbers, wheelbarrow, metal spades, roofing nails, big nails,  doors, H2 water tanks, fencing and barbed wire, jembe, axe, hammer, panga, tables, jerrycans, plastic bags, generators, iron bars, racks, agricultural water tube, digging bars, solar panels & equipment, tape measure, hand-saw, paint, pipes, fittings, 

$3,000 - Transport of materials (from Kenya and Uganda)  

$12,000 - Construction labor

$10,000 - Ambulance


In case of not reaching our entire goal, the funds will go towards each of the next stages of the healthcare center construction. E.g., the bricks are ready and land (500mtrs X 450mtrs) is allocated. The next stage  is to buy the cement and build the center. Then the roof.. etc.,  and we will continue, using all funds received to build each of the next stages. If the funds received exceed the target, then we will proceed with Stage 2, which is to construct a classroom for primary education in Longiro. Approximately 200 children are currently learning English in an outdoor classroom.    The Impact Primarily, you will help reduce the mortality rate. However, we anticipate your contribution support development in the Lopit Mountain region. This includes reducing the mortality rate for all 57 villages in the region, building schools, establishing rehabilitation centers for people suffering from Leprosy, developing farming and agriculture to improve food security and establish financial sustainability. 
Several NGO's are operating aid projects in the Lopit Mountains. These include UNICEF, Save The Children, Norwegian Church Aid and Association for Aid & Relief, Japan. Your contribution will encourage and help to stimulate all efforts.
By contributing, you will play an important role in helping save and give life to people in the Lopit. 
    Risks & Challenges 

The violence that erupted on 15 December 2013 between armed forces
loyal to President Salva Kiir and armed forces loyal to Former Vice President Riek
Machar in Juba, the capital city of South Sudan, has resulted in numerous challenges
to government programs, including reform of the country's poor healthcare
system.
Despite making significant gains in promoting awareness of
health and wellness in South Sudan, preventable diseases remain a serious
issue. Malaria is one of the country's biggest problems, with thousands of
children dying daily from this treatable disease. Although rates of HIV and
AIDS infection have slowed in recent years, many families are impacted by these
serious conditions. 
Also poor sanitation in the  Lopit Mountain areas and the lack of
affordable medication further contributes to the spread of disease, and many women
and children do not have access to even basic medical treatment.A key challenge will be to provide  trained healthcare  staff and/ or volunteers on the ground. Although there's lots of goodwill for providing this support, it is yet to be confirmed. 
Another challenge will be to ensure that equipment shipped can be used and ongoing supply sustained. Plans to develop agriculture as a means for building sustainability are also in the initiative stage.
The exciting aspect though is that this project is being driven and implemented by the Lopit Community itself. Primarily, it is their 'determination' driving it forward to help their motherland.
For at least a couple of years, the Lopit Community in Australia has been building its network, presenting the situation to various organisations and is receiving ongoing support. As a result of these efforts in 2012, a 40' container of supplies was loaded in Melbourne and shipped to the Lopit Mountains. It contained: 




Clothing for children and adults 
Shoes, boots and sandals
Food items (including rice, lentils, milk powder, beans, tuna, oil, sugar; wheat flour; other non-perishable goods)
Medical supplies
Kitchenware (cooking utensils and pots, bowls and cups)
Bedding (sheets and blankets)
Cloth/fabric (of any sort, that can be made into clothing)
Mosquito nets
Sewing machines (treadle machines, not electric)
Organic seed for grain and vegetable crops
Hand tools for agriculture and also for building
Soap

For more information, visit https://hnhproject.wordpress.com/page/3/
The Lopit Community in Australia raised an initial $8,000 and sent 3 representatives to the Lopit area to assess the situation and return with their findings. This entire project is based on moving in the direction of development as determined by the Lopit people, and coupled with support garnered in Australia and partnerships established with international organisations, are major factors for overcoming these and other hurdles along the way.A variety of approaches for solving these challenges and saving lives in Lopit region include:
Major health interventions will work even in the poorest remote areas of Lopit by building healthcare and schools facilities across the region and train members of Lopit community to manage the system and Providing universal healthcare access to all women and children.
Involvement of volunteers from around the world will play significant role in lowering mortality rate in the peaceful region of Lopit Mountain. Your involvement as a volunteer is very important to set a good example that will lead to success for  locals to follow.
Introduction of programs in many forms, e.g, health awareness, workshops across the region and adequate funding from both international and local sources for improving women and children’s access to healthcare and education. 
Good management on the ground and effective use of information will decrease the risk of infection to slow down the spread and decreasing vulnerability to reduce risk and impact. Sustainable Donor funding will save lives and money
Partnerships with Lopit community, NGOs, and private companies can be powerful.

But have you ever tasted a rich, thick, syrupy balsamic that's been aged for 25 years in casks made of oak, chestnut, mulberry, cherry, ash, and juniper, each one yielding a particular aroma to the vinegar, rendering it unique? This is one perk you won't want to miss!





""Aged Balsamic Vinegar of Reggio Emilia must come directly from the pressing of grapes traditionally cultivated in the Reggio Emilia province. This prized balsamic is extraordinarily complex and possesses an intricate layering of flavors that represents generations of craftsmanship and respects rigorous traditions. 

Rare and unequaled, a few drops will add glorious flavors to sauces, cheeses, and salads. Those who prefer savories will relish it with
their best, mature cheese. Dessert lovers will savor its combination with custard cream, chocolate desserts, ice cream, fruits, and as the supreme ingredient in fillings for panettone and strudel. 

To experience the full complexity of its noble and highly intense combination of perfumes and scents, try some on its own in a small glass: it should be sipped like a wine for meditation at the end of a meal. ""

Over and Above!

Our perks are fabulous and we have learned how much you love our bargain days! So we anticipate raising more than our initial goal, and have thought ahead and committed to some further business enhancements.

OUR ADDITIONAL FUNDING GOALS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:
1. Stretch Goal - an additional $5000. If our perks prove popular, meeting our stretch goal will allow us to purchase a larger chocolate tempering machine, which our head chocolatier would LOVE! It would go a long way towards helping her keep up with the demand for truffles for 2 stores! We fully expect the truffles to be as popular up there as they are down here and know she will be extremely busy. She never complains, but we would certainly love to be able to buy this for her!  





Thanks!

It's been a great year, learning the ropes and getting to know all of our fabulous customers - and we mean that from the bottom of our hearts. We have the BEST customers in the world and that's what makes owning The Olive Leaf so fun and rewarding. 
So we want to say ""Thanks"" right now to everyone for helping us with our expansion! We can't do it without you and we appreciate you more than we could ever convey! 
We are blessed to know all of you.",9.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p><b>Part one: the main characters</b></p>
<p><b><i>Ghawe</i></b></p>
<p>In september 2014 I returned to
South Africa to work for a whole year at Kwa.Mama Care Center, a community
center in the township Shakashead. Kwa.Mama runs a free preschool,  a
soup kitchen for the elderly and the fragile people and developed a youth program.
Among all the people I met, one boy immediately gained my special attention
because he was in need of more help than the others: Ghawe, the wild child.</p>
<p>He was only a toddler when he showed
up at the center for the first time. Years ago he came to the gate, with barely
any clothes on. Nobody could come near him. He would always eat his food very
quickly, on a safe distance from everybody. But after a while he started to
come more often. He began to trust our place. He started playing with the
others. He even started to wash himself.</p>
<p>Since a month he doesn't go to 'home' anymore. We learned that the shoes<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> we had given to him, had been sold by
his own grandmother. We heard that at 'home' he had to sleep on the ground,
without a blanket. We saw him swallowing a whole bread on his way home. We
discovered that he is being beaten very often.</span></p>
<p>Social welfare was informed and gave
us the permission to keep Ghawe here at Kwa.Mama. We talked to his mother
who lives far away, in the Eastern Cape. At this moment in her life she can't
take fully responsibility for Ghawe. But Ntombi didn't need much time
to decide that she wanted to be his foster mother.</p>
<p><b><i>Ntombi</i></b></p>
<p>Ntombi lives at  Kwa.Mama, in
room number ten, together with her children Vusi of ten years old,  Themba, who
is six, and Nomonde, fifteen. She's a single mother who works at Kwa.Mama
during the day. At Kwa.Mama she does not earn any money, but works for tokens.
These tokens can be exchanged every friday for tins of food or second hand
clothes that are being donated to us very often. Two days a week she works
outside to do some mowing for a bus company, to earn some money. After her work
she goes to the evening school: she wants to get her diploma and later go on
with studying to become a nurse. But actually, she already is a nurse. She
is the running force of our home care program, she looks after the sick and old
people of this community . And since July she also looks after our six year old
wild child, Ghawe. </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Part two: what could/should happen </b></p>
<p>I want to give Ghawe a home,
a safe and clear structure where he can grow. During the day he attends our
preschool till he can go to primary school. In the evenings he lives with his
new family. He learns to follow the rules, learns to share, to listen, to
trust. </p>
<p>I want to help Ntombi
financially in this task. With a small amount of money her life would be so
much easier. She wouldn't have to worry how to feed her family every evening.
With this help, I believe that Ntombi will be able to stay at Kwa.Mama and
would not have to leave on the hunt for another job. So, with this campaign you also support the old and fragile people of Shakashead. </p>
<p>Every month Ntombi would get
fifty euro for the daily expenses. This means I would need six hundred euro for
a whole year. The rest of the money serves to be able to pay extras, like a
school uniform or some money for traveling, so Ghawe can visit his mother
during the school holidays.</p>

<p>Unleash the inner Pirate in You, and become supporter today!</p><br/></div>","Pirate Pizza Nola, LLC is a New Orleans pop-up pizzeria and mobile food vendor, and we're building a storefront as unique as our Food Bike.  We've put Pirates, Pizza, Bikes, and Parading together and into a truly innovative Mobile Food solution and experience that is as Artistic, Creative, Delicious, and Fun as the Creswcent City, and now we want to build a Bike Shop Pizzeria, Bakery, & Cafe business concept.

 First off, our Pizza is delicious.  Like ridiculously good.  We hand make Roma style pizzas with a ""razor thin"" crust, robust original recipe sauces, slow smoked BBQ and specialty meats, a 4 cheese blend, and fresh market produce.  Check out our website for menus and our Facebook page for the latest updates & more.  We also cater a wide variety of menu options.
 
We got our first start in 2012 at one of the best reviewed craft cocktail/neighborhood dive bars in New Orleans, ""Twelve Mile Limit"" in Mid City, thanks to owner T. Cole Newton and Chef Chris Shortall (Now at Latitude 29 in Nola), and we still do Sunday nights at Twelve Mile Limit from 6-10. 

Pirate Pizza Nola has also popped up at some of the best neighborhood bars in New Orleans like Pals Lounge in Mid City, BJ's in the Bywater, & outside the R Bar in the Marigny.  We've been well received and well reviewed, and both locals and visitors love our product.  


Pirate Pizza Nola is the creator and home of the world's first ""Tricycle Pirate Pizza Ship "" that is shown in our videos.  Her nameless bones rolled out 2 years ago this last New Years, and since then she's evolved  into ""The Pizza Maria"", you can see in our pictures and videos.

 
 It seems like every week we add something new or improve her in some way, and she's a rolling rocking pizza-making, appetite-kidnapping, fire breathing and parading machine.  

 
With her support ship the ""Jalape-Nina II"" in tow we are able to cook 4 pizzas at a time, preparing them on 30+ sq/ft of stainless steel folding integrated work table space, and she is capable of serving hundreds of slices a shift.

 
In 2014 we were fortunate to be invited by Katrina Brees to join the Krewe of Kolossas art bicycles as they paraded with the Krewe of Muses for Mardi Gras 2013.  Muses is hands down one of the most popular and our favorite Mardi Gras parade, and we went again this year.  Both times we've had the time of our lives, and this year we brought a new guy with us.

 
The most recent addition was when Sir Bartholomew ""Iron Jaw"" El Fuego joined our Krewe.  ""Iron Jaw Bart"" as we call him, was born in an Obtainium Mine and raised to manhood by the hand of Andres Alchemy, and he's a magnificent Pirate.    

 Once Ironjaw Bart joined our Krewe,. we immediately upgraded him to include fire blazing through his skull.  We fitted him to ride on the bow for Parade days, and act as a hand warmer for our customers when we're out.  If you pull his trigger, he gets a little ""fiery""
This year for the Krewe of Muses Parade, it was like having a volume control for the crowd, I'd pull the trigger, Bart's head would go ablaze, and the crowd would ROAR!
One of our rewards is a ""Petite Bartholomew"" votive holder we're crafting just for our backers.  

OUR PLAN:

This campaign is for $50,000.00, and our project objectives are to build a Bike Shop Pizza Kitchen and expand our fleet of Pizza Ships.

</div><h1><b>The Briar Challenge is Coming!!!</b></h1><div>
</div><p><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'><b>I need your help to bring the Briar Challenge to life!</b></span><br/></p><div>
</div><p><span>
The Briar Challenges are Mixed Reality Adventures that can turn a typical
afternoon into murder mystery, treasure hunt, a fantasy quest, and more!  </span></p><p><span>This campaign is my way of getting the word out and finding the founding members for Club Thorn! The first 100 people who become members will earn the title ""Legendary Founders"" and those who join by the end of 2015 will be the rest of the founding members.<br/><br/>These aren't board games or video games! They are played in the real world, but they contain a mix of elements from those traditional games with the addition of geocaching (location based play) and augmented reality. I'm also going to add in some activities and projects for members of Club Thorn.<br/>
<br/>
Each Briar Challenge can be linked to a local cause, so people who play will be
supporting their community while having fun! In a few months they will be playable using a smartphone app called Clue Keeper, the company just needs to finish upgrading their code to handle the augmented reality clues I'm creating.</span></p><div>
</div><p>Using Spherical video (360 x 360 full sphere panorama)
and your smart phone, it's possible to enter another world entirely or replay a
scene filmed where you stand.  Music Videos are already being filmed using
these cameras, Taylor Swift and Walk Off The Earth are two you might have seen,
but there are many more out there!<br/>
<br/>
I already have a camera capable of doing this, but it has limitations and I'm hoping
to raise enough to upgrade to professional equipment that can do more. I also need to upgrade my computer, printing, and recording equipment to increase the quality of the game content.<br/>
<br/>
The Briar Challenges combine this type of video with geocaching and add all the
fun of an elaborate quest to create an adventure in your own backyard or around
Sussex County's points of interest.  You
might discover local spots that you've never heard of and you will definitely
have fun trying to solve the clues, finding the hiding spots, and unraveling
the mystery!  <br/>
<br/>
There will be three different ways to play a Briar Challenge and as more people
play, more Challenges will be released for each version.  The money I raise here will go to help create better quality game content and more Briar Challenges to play.<br/>
<br/></p><div>
</div><h2>
Home Edition: </h2><div>
This contains everything you need to host a quest in your own backyard or a
local park. Reusable for future Challenges.  There will be an option to
turn a family event into a fundraiser for a cause of your choice using
Crowdrise.

</div><p></p><div>
</div><h2>Self Guided Challenge: </h2><div>
These will be located across Sussex County and available for purchase through
the Clue Keeper App for Smartphones and Tablets. My goal is to have the first
of these ready for Halloween this year! I want to have a new Challenge every Month!</div><p></p><div>
</div><h2>Hosted Briar Challenge Events: </h2><div>
These will be one day skill competitions with entry fees, cash prizes for the
finalists, and so much fun!  It's a chance to raise lots of funds for
local causes and basically another excuse to throw a party! This type of event may have to wait until I can get enough funding to hire a lawyer - otherwise I'll get stuck in red tape...<br/><br/>
</div><p>Regardless of which way you decide to play, you get to
have fun while doing good for the community. Help me spread the word, the
more people who see my posts, the higher the probability I'll find the backers
I need to do this right.</p><div>
</div><h1><span><br/>Why I want
to Upgrade my Equipment:</span></h1><div>
</div><p>
</p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><ul><li><span>Spherical Video requires processing and editing
     to look professional, that requires a computer that won't threaten to
     commit suicide by spontaneous combustion  as my current
     laptop does. A Sprout PC is my goal, but the price starts at
     $1899 </span></li></ul><div>
</div><ul><li>Making unique containers and gadgets to create
     really interesting Hiding Spots for clues will take on a level of magic if I add a
     3D Printer to my arsenal. A Dremel 3D Printer is my goal, but that
     price starts $999</li></ul><div>
</div><ul><li><span>I have a Ricoh Theta m15 to take video, it's
     great but has built in limitations, to upgrade this will cost the biggest
     chunk of change and is presented in hopes of hitting it as a stretch goal if the funding nears the $15,000 mark. However expensive it seems, it is actually cheap
     considering it would enable me to record in 3D Spherical Video at a level of quality that makes it worth pulling out your Oculus or Google Cardboard to play. It would
     require 14 Go Pros + 360 rigs + Software + Accessories = ~10,000</span></li></ul><div>

</div></div>","The Briar Challenge is Coming!!!
I need your help to bring the Briar Challenge to life!

The Briar Challenges are Mixed Reality Adventures that can turn a typical
afternoon into murder mystery, treasure hunt, a fantasy quest, and more!  This campaign is my way of getting the word out and finding the founding members for Club Thorn! The first 100 people who become members will earn the title ""Legendary Founders"" and those who join by the end of 2015 will be the rest of the founding members.These aren't board games or video games! They are played in the real world, but they contain a mix of elements from those traditional games with the addition of geocaching (location based play) and augmented reality. I'm also going to add in some activities and projects for members of Club Thorn.

Each Briar Challenge can be linked to a local cause, so people who play will be
supporting their community while having fun! In a few months they will be playable using a smartphone app called Clue Keeper, the company just needs to finish upgrading their code to handle the augmented reality clues I'm creating.
Using Spherical video (360 x 360 full sphere panorama)
and your smart phone, it's possible to enter another world entirely or replay a
scene filmed where you stand.  Music Videos are already being filmed using
these cameras, Taylor Swift and Walk Off The Earth are two you might have seen,
but there are many more out there!

I already have a camera capable of doing this, but it has limitations and I'm hoping
to raise enough to upgrade to professional equipment that can do more. I also need to upgrade my computer, printing, and recording equipment to increase the quality of the game content.

The Briar Challenges combine this type of video with geocaching and add all the
fun of an elaborate quest to create an adventure in your own backyard or around
Sussex County's points of interest.  You
might discover local spots that you've never heard of and you will definitely
have fun trying to solve the clues, finding the hiding spots, and unraveling
the mystery!  

There will be three different ways to play a Briar Challenge and as more people
play, more Challenges will be released for each version.  The money I raise here will go to help create better quality game content and more Briar Challenges to play.


Home Edition: 
This contains everything you need to host a quest in your own backyard or a
local park. Reusable for future Challenges.  There will be an option to
turn a family event into a fundraiser for a cause of your choice using
Crowdrise.


Self Guided Challenge: 
These will be located across Sussex County and available for purchase through
the Clue Keeper App for Smartphones and Tablets. My goal is to have the first
of these ready for Halloween this year! I want to have a new Challenge every Month!
Hosted Briar Challenge Events: 
These will be one day skill competitions with entry fees, cash prizes for the
finalists, and so much fun!  It's a chance to raise lots of funds for
local causes and basically another excuse to throw a party! This type of event may have to wait until I can get enough funding to hire a lawyer - otherwise I'll get stuck in red tape...
Regardless of which way you decide to play, you get to
have fun while doing good for the community. Help me spread the word, the
more people who see my posts, the higher the probability I'll find the backers
I need to do this right.
Why I want
to Upgrade my Equipment:



Spherical Video requires processing and editing
     to look professional, that requires a computer that won't threaten to
     commit suicide by spontaneous combustion  as my current
     laptop does. A Sprout PC is my goal, but the price starts at
     $1899 
Making unique containers and gadgets to create
     really interesting Hiding Spots for clues will take on a level of magic if I add a
     3D Printer to my arsenal. A Dremel 3D Printer is my goal, but that
     price starts $999
I have a Ricoh Theta m15 to take video, it's
     great but has built in limitations, to upgrade this will cost the biggest
     chunk of change and is presented in hopes of hitting it as a stretch goal if the funding nears the $15,000 mark. However expensive it seems, it is actually cheap
     considering it would enable me to record in 3D Spherical Video at a level of quality that makes it worth pulling out your Oculus or Google Cardboard to play. It would
     require 14 Go Pros + 360 rigs + Software + Accessories = ~10,000


What I can Give You for Your Help!I can already do this, so no waiting required!
First Come, First Serve - I will work on all rewards in the order they are received.

</div>
<div>This project has two distinct priorities, make amazing, innovative and experimental spirits at our nano-distillery located at Kettleborough Cider House on Dressel's Orchards, and create New York's first Farm Beverage eating and drinking establishment, tasting room and retail shop on Main Street in Gardiner.</div>

<p><u><b>Who?</b></u></p>
<b>Gable Erenzo, CSS</b><p>As a former Principle at Tuthilltown Spirits, a Distiller and Ambassador, Gable has divided the past 10 years between production, management of Tuthilltown, and the national roll out of Hudson Whiskey. With over 20 years in production and national event management, an associate’s degree from CU, a BS in Business Management from SUNY New Paltz, and a CSS (Certified Spirits Specialist) certification he brings considerable business knowledge and industry experience to his company. Gable’s prior position as Head Distiller and Production Manager at the Tuthilltown educated him about all aspects of the distillation process, preparing him for his role as National Hudson Brand Ambassador and now as Founder and Managing Member of Gardiner Liquid Mercantile. A rock climber and outdoor enthusiast from the very start, Gable has been climbing in the “Gunks” for over 20 years. He is happy to be working at something he loves, surrounded by friends and family.</p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><u>Where?</u></b></p>
<p>GLM has purchased a building in a Hamlet
Commercial zone on main street, in the heart of Gardiner.  The building has been gutted and comes with
all building and zoning permit approvals for an eating and drinking establishment.  With a recently renovated historic commercial
space next door, a high-end market across the street, the Wallkill Valley
Rail-trail steps away, attractive buildings throughout the village, and the
extraordinary traffic through town (44/55 traffic on this stretch was last
measured in 2003 with average daily traffic at 5129 cars) to all the areas
attractions, Gardiner is ripe for a business of this type.</p>
<p>The current building has professional approved plans drawn
up to finish the construction in an attractive and useful way for what was to
become a wine bar. In addition to the 1500sq’ of indoor space which includes
two story vaulted ceiling and a pre-approved 10' wide deck facing the sidewalk, there is another 1/8 acre of yard surrounding the
building which through special permitting by the town and patio construction
will allow for additional 3 season outdoor seating.</p>
<p><b><u>Customers</u></b></p>
<p>The proliferation of Craft Distilleries and Breweries in the
Mid Hudson Valley has created an additional tourism draw to the region with
Gardiner as the birthplace of New York State Whiskey and Distilling.  As part of the family and team that pioneered
this industry and built the most successful American craft whiskey brand in the
world, the opening of this establishment will be press worthy news for both
industry and local media.  Capitalizing
on this attention, GLM will become a draw for fans from near and far while also
creating new media buzz that will share our story with new consumers within
driving distance.</p>
<p>With this Main Street location, GLM will capture the tourist traffic from this category as well as the numerous
other attractions in Gardiner, including but not limited to:</p>

<p>A year round business cannot survive on tourism alone, particularly in
the harsh climate of the North East. 
Attracting locals and regionals will be essential to the success and
growth of the business. By offering a one stop shop for all local beverage
products as well as extremely limited house made spirits only available for
retail and consumption at this one location, GLM creates a unique draw for both
locals and visitors.  In addition to
retail sales and beverages by the glass, we will offer small plates using
seasonal local ingredients prepared on site by a local chef.</p>

<p><b><u>Products</u></b></p>
<p><b>PHASE 1</b></p>
<p>Retail and bar operation
will open its doors by purchasing product from local distilleries, wineries,
breweries and cideries.  These local
products will be sold both by the bottle and by the glass, with local spirits
offered in mixed drinks for consumption on premises.  Per the D license, we will also serve a
limited menu of high quality local and seasonal faire.  In addition to locally produced beverages (on
and off premise consumption), GLM will retail items such as:</p>

</ul>
<p><b>PHASE 2</b></p>
<p>While Phase 1 is underway, GLM Partner Distiller, Joel Elder will focus on
development and production of distilled beverages to be sold directly through
storefront and bar.  With combined distilling
experience of the team, small batches of various spirits and spirit based
beverages will be produced with the goal of fully stocking the bar and shelves
with all categories of spirit.  Aside
from the consumer draw of a bar and store that produce all their own liquor,
this is also the financial key to attaining unheard of margins on both retail
and bar sales. With typical markups of 30% for both distributor and retailer,
these two middlemen are removed and this margin is absorbed into the
organization.  When sold for onsite
consumption, the margin multiplies again.</p>
<p>As revenue increases we will increase capacity of distillery
with the potential to eventually sell wholesale from our store front creating a
unique draw for craft bartenders and retail shops that are known for obscure
high quality spirits, along with NYS Farm Wineries, Breweries and Cideries
which are also allowed to sell NYS branded Liquor.  House distilled products will include but not
be limited to the following spirits, made from all local and seasonal fruit and
grain.</p>

<p><b><u>Design and
Marketing</u></b></p>
<p>General aesthetic of GLM, signage and branding will reflect
the historic nature of the products we are selling and the village we call
home.  Vintage agricultural and
distilling equipment (tools, barrels, etc) along with historic photos, signs
and business materials will be the starting point in designing an identity that
seems both timeless and relevant. 
Seasoned barn wood, patina copper, Edison light bulbs, antique bottles, period
glassware and bar tools, and other eclectic finds will be used to accent a
repurposed wood bar with brass foot rail and complimentary bar stools.</p>
<p>Retail shelving, checkout counter and displays will be built
from repurposed materials collected as locally as possible.</p>
<p>Signage will be the key to capturing vehicle traffic and
should visually tell a story of our pioneering efforts in the Distilling
Revolution while also reflecting the agricultural past of the area.  </p>

<div><br/></div></div>","Gardiner Liquid MercantileMy name is Gable Erenzo and I am a former LLC Member of New York State's Pioneer Farm Distillery, Tuthilltown Spirits.  After 10 years of growing this family business, I have stepped out on the plank to pursue my dream of distilling on a hyper local and extremely small scale, and creating a hub for all the amazing farm beverage producers in the immediate vicinity of my home, Gardiner, NY. 

This project has two distinct priorities, make amazing, innovative and experimental spirits at our nano-distillery located at Kettleborough Cider House on Dressel's Orchards, and create New York's first Farm Beverage eating and drinking establishment, tasting room and retail shop on Main Street in Gardiner.

Background

By now I am sure you have caught wind of the exciting world of Farm and Craft Distilling.  With new distillers opening their doors daily in every state across the Nation, its a great time to explore what your locale has to offer.  Now take minute and lets step back to look at Farm Beverages in general.  Here in New York State we have a thriving Agricultural Community finding new avenue's for it's harvests in local wine, cider, beer and spirits.  Up until now, most of these producers must either build a small sales team and self distribute, or find themselves a distributor that is willing to take on their products.  For the fortunate brands that arrange distribution, the fight for shelf space begins.

The 2014 Craft Act has created a new opportunity for Craft
Beverage producers in New York State.  The
amended D Farm Distillery License now allows for a distillery branch office and
sale of beverages by the glass for on premise consumption. Within the
distillery branch office all legal rights of a icensed distillery are extended
to secondary location.  These rights
included (actual copy provided in addendum 1):





Production
of up to 75k gallons of liquor made from NYS Fruit or Grain


Retail sale of all NYS labeled
liquor for both on (cocktails and spirits by the  glass) and off premise consumption


Retail
sale of NYS branded wine, beer, cider for off-premise consumption


Ability to open and operate a
restaurant or food & drinking establishment on or adjacent  to satellite location


Right to apply for Tavern Wine
license to serve wine and beer for on premise consumption


Previous to this act, there were no provisions to acquire
license for both a manufacturing facility and an onsite consumption
establishment, and are therefor no currently operational competitors.  This project continues the pioneering efforts
of the Erenzo family within the NYS distilling movement.
GLM aims to be the first licensed distillery to open a satellite
location with the addition of a Tavern Wine License, creating a locally focused
eating and drinking establishment on the same premises as a retail store with
the ability to sell all NYS branded beer, wine, cider and liquor for both on
and off premise consumption, as well as wholesale distilled products to
wineries, breweries, cideries and commercial bars, restaurants and retailers
interested in limited and obscure small batch spirits.


Who?
Gable Erenzo, CSSAs a former Principle at Tuthilltown Spirits, a Distiller and Ambassador, Gable has divided the past 10 years between production, management of Tuthilltown, and the national roll out of Hudson Whiskey. With over 20 years in production and national event management, an associate’s degree from CU, a BS in Business Management from SUNY New Paltz, and a CSS (Certified Spirits Specialist) certification he brings considerable business knowledge and industry experience to his company. Gable’s prior position as Head Distiller and Production Manager at the Tuthilltown educated him about all aspects of the distillation process, preparing him for his role as National Hudson Brand Ambassador and now as Founder and Managing Member of Gardiner Liquid Mercantile. A rock climber and outdoor enthusiast from the very start, Gable has been climbing in the “Gunks” for over 20 years. He is happy to be working at something he loves, surrounded by friends and family.
Where?
GLM has purchased a building in a Hamlet
Commercial zone on main street, in the heart of Gardiner.  The building has been gutted and comes with
all building and zoning permit approvals for an eating and drinking establishment.  With a recently renovated historic commercial
space next door, a high-end market across the street, the Wallkill Valley
Rail-trail steps away, attractive buildings throughout the village, and the
extraordinary traffic through town (44/55 traffic on this stretch was last
measured in 2003 with average daily traffic at 5129 cars) to all the areas
attractions, Gardiner is ripe for a business of this type.
The current building has professional approved plans drawn
up to finish the construction in an attractive and useful way for what was to
become a wine bar. In addition to the 1500sq’ of indoor space which includes
two story vaulted ceiling and a pre-approved 10' wide deck facing the sidewalk, there is another 1/8 acre of yard surrounding the
building which through special permitting by the town and patio construction
will allow for additional 3 season outdoor seating.
Customers
The proliferation of Craft Distilleries and Breweries in the
Mid Hudson Valley has created an additional tourism draw to the region with
Gardiner as the birthplace of New York State Whiskey and Distilling.  As part of the family and team that pioneered
this industry and built the most successful American craft whiskey brand in the
world, the opening of this establishment will be press worthy news for both
industry and local media.  Capitalizing
on this attention, GLM will become a draw for fans from near and far while also
creating new media buzz that will share our story with new consumers within
driving distance.
With this Main Street location, GLM will capture the tourist traffic from this category as well as the numerous
other attractions in Gardiner, including but not limited to:



Tuthilltown
Spirits


Whitecliff
Winery


Kettleboro
Cidery (Dressels Farm)


Robibero
Winery


Adair
Winery


Jankee
Folley Cidery (Jenkins & Leuken Orchard and Farm Stand)


Yard Owl Brewery


Skydive the
Ranch


Mohonk Preserve (year round outdoor
activities, including highest traffic climbing area in the country)


Mohonk
Mountain House


Wallkill
Valley Rail Trail


Minnewaska
State Park


Wallkill
Farm


Tantillo’s
Farm


Wrights
Farm


A year round business cannot survive on tourism alone, particularly in
the harsh climate of the North East. 
Attracting locals and regionals will be essential to the success and
growth of the business. By offering a one stop shop for all local beverage
products as well as extremely limited house made spirits only available for
retail and consumption at this one location, GLM creates a unique draw for both
locals and visitors.  In addition to
retail sales and beverages by the glass, we will offer small plates using
seasonal local ingredients prepared on site by a local chef.


Products
PHASE 1
Retail and bar operation
will open its doors by purchasing product from local distilleries, wineries,
breweries and cideries.  These local
products will be sold both by the bottle and by the glass, with local spirits
offered in mixed drinks for consumption on premises.  Per the D license, we will also serve a
limited menu of high quality local and seasonal faire.  In addition to locally produced beverages (on
and off premise consumption), GLM will retail items such as:



 Branded
clothing


  Bottled
cocktails


  Local
pre-packaged food items (chocolate, pickles, salsa, jam, etc)


  Relevant
books


  Bottle
aging kits


  Used
whiskey barrels


  Proper
glassware


  Bitters


  High end
barware


PHASE 2
While Phase 1 is underway, GLM Partner Distiller, Joel Elder will focus on
development and production of distilled beverages to be sold directly through
storefront and bar.  With combined distilling
experience of the team, small batches of various spirits and spirit based
beverages will be produced with the goal of fully stocking the bar and shelves
with all categories of spirit.  Aside
from the consumer draw of a bar and store that produce all their own liquor,
this is also the financial key to attaining unheard of margins on both retail
and bar sales. With typical markups of 30% for both distributor and retailer,
these two middlemen are removed and this margin is absorbed into the
organization.  When sold for onsite
consumption, the margin multiplies again.
As revenue increases we will increase capacity of distillery
with the potential to eventually sell wholesale from our store front creating a
unique draw for craft bartenders and retail shops that are known for obscure
high quality spirits, along with NYS Farm Wineries, Breweries and Cideries
which are also allowed to sell NYS branded Liquor.  House distilled products will include but not
be limited to the following spirits, made from all local and seasonal fruit and
grain.



Brandy (apple and grape)


Apple Jack

Eau De Vie

Gin


Amari


Bitters


Pommeau


Absinthe


Cacao
Spirit


Fruit
Liqueurs


Maple and
Honey based spirits


Single
Barrel local wine


Design and
Marketing
General aesthetic of GLM, signage and branding will reflect
the historic nature of the products we are selling and the village we call
home.  Vintage agricultural and
distilling equipment (tools, barrels, etc) along with historic photos, signs
and business materials will be the starting point in designing an identity that
seems both timeless and relevant. 
Seasoned barn wood, patina copper, Edison light bulbs, antique bottles, period
glassware and bar tools, and other eclectic finds will be used to accent a
repurposed wood bar with brass foot rail and complimentary bar stools.
Retail shelving, checkout counter and displays will be built
from repurposed materials collected as locally as possible.
Signage will be the key to capturing vehicle traffic and
should visually tell a story of our pioneering efforts in the Distilling
Revolution while also reflecting the agricultural past of the area.  


Where it Stands
An idea that began its evolution over a year ago is now in the final stages of realization.  Here is a quick list of the hurdles we have cleared so far.


Incorporated as Gardiner Liquid Mercantile, LLC
Corporate bank accounts and credit cards opened
Certificate of Authority, EIN, Surety Bond are all received and filed
TTB (Federal Regulatory Body for Alcohol Production) Approval for Bonded Distillery
SLA (State Liquor Authority of NY) Approval for Farm Distillery License, Class D
Basic equipment bought
Space secured for distillery within the Kettleborough Cider House on Dressel's Farm
Building purchased on Main Street for the Farm Bar & Cafe, Tasting Room and Retail Shop
Contractors secured and architectural drawings under way for final building permit
Logo complete and design work for packaging and interior of building under way


With the heavy lifting complete, now the fun begins.
What We Need, What You Want

Though we are asking for $45k, you will see in the budget below this is only a portion of the funding necessary.  All other capital is coming from my personal savings.  Every penny I have saved and some I have borrowed will be invested into the project.  The hope is that this level of commitment and confidence illustrates my personal drive to utilize all my skills, contacts, experience, and ability to bring this project to a successful and sustainable outcome.BUDGET PHASE 1

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There
aren't many non-profitable initiatives that would swim for hours in
the Alaskan Pacific with pods of Orcas lurking in the depths. There aren’t
many, if any, non-profits putting their lives at risk for children who

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Madswimmer is
a group of daring South African open water swimmers who swim for children in need. They do crazy swims all over the world that put food on tables, support children in health crisis, enable
education and provide opportunities. Each time swimmers take to the water they face deadly threats
- frozen waters, currents, sharks. But danger is the point. ""By risking
our lives we are investing everything. If we don't, how can we

ALL STARTED</b></h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">While on
honeymoon in 2000, Jean Craven stood on the Rock of Gibraltar looking
across the water to Morocco thinking “I’m sure I can swim this”. Nine
years later, a bet of R100,000 (ZAR) among friends saw him and a friend Tim Ziehl

</div></div>","INTRODUCING
MADSWIMMER
There
aren't many non-profitable initiatives that would swim for hours in
the Alaskan Pacific with pods of Orcas lurking in the depths. There aren’t
many, if any, non-profits putting their lives at risk for children who
can't fend for themselves.  
Madswimmer is
a group of daring South African open water swimmers who swim for children in need. They do crazy swims all over the world that put food on tables, support children in health crisis, enable
education and provide opportunities. Each time swimmers take to the water they face deadly threats
- frozen waters, currents, sharks. But danger is the point. ""By risking
our lives we are investing everything. If we don't, how can we
expect our donors to invest in children who deserve a better chance? Facing threats might mean that we're mad...but
we have to be even madder not to care!""
WHERE IT
ALL STARTED
While on
honeymoon in 2000, Jean Craven stood on the Rock of Gibraltar looking
across the water to Morocco thinking “I’m sure I can swim this”. Nine
years later, a bet of R100,000 (ZAR) among friends saw him and a friend Tim Ziehl
swim the       17 km Strait of Gibraltar in just over four hours. Feeling sorry for
taking betting money from friends, they donated the money to charity. That planted the idea of annual swims to help change disadvantaged children's lives. Madswimmer registered as a non-profit organisation in 2009 and since then completed all 6 recognised intercontinental swims and various daring others that raised over $420 000 for children's
charities. 
WHAT
MAKES US DIFFERENT? 


We are no different, we are everyday people:  Parents, partners, breadwinners who sacrifice our
     time and money to prove what normal people can do when they put their
     minds to helping others.  



Benefiting others: With each swim we raise
     life-changing money. We’ll swim among killer whales, exhaust
     our physical and mental strength and test the limits of what is possible.
     For charity. 



Danger: Our swims are not easy - icy weather, sharks, walruses, currents. But danger is the draw card.



Pioneers: The group has
     accomplished various world firsts. Among them the 1st ever series of
     possible swims connecting all continents.  Our swim on Mt Ojos del Salado in December 2015 will be the highest in the world at 6400 m above sea level - 1100 m higher than base camp Mt Everest.

Kenya at 4700m above sea level and were the first ever to cross the Swahili Channel (35km) from Tanzania to Zanzibar.                        
NOW, THE HIGHEST SWIM, EVER  On 5
December 2015 Madswimmer will take on the highest swim on top of the world's highest
volcano, Mt Ojos del Salado in Chile. This will be a world record breaking physical
experience, swimming at 6400 m above sea level. Nobody has attempted such extreme levels of altitude and cold before as far as we know.  Have a look at what we are about to attempt:          
DANGERS:  The combination of hypothermia (dangerously low body temperature) and altitude sickness (decreased availability of oxygen at high altitudes) can cause acute health problems - wanting to swim fast
to get the cold over, but also, not being able to swim so fast due to altitude
challenges. We will be hiking up a volcano in the Atacama desert and that alone will take 8 days, so dehydration is a real risk. And we will be extremely remote - 500km from the
closest large airport in Copiapo. 
CHALLENGES: The swim is 1.1km higher than Lewis Pugh's ice swim record in Nepal, which is quite a big difference at this altitude. Then we are not sure
if the pool will be frozen or not - so we are taking chain saws with just in case
to cut open a lane in the ice. Night temperatures of minus 20°C could be expected on the
mountain and the water could be near freezing point. Swimmers will
attempt the swim in Speedo's only! All in aid of vulnerable children. 
THE TEAM: The expedition will consist of eight Madswimmers and a media and medical support team. Our medical experts are Dr Sean Gottschalk, from ER Consulting Inc, who also accompanied world known swimmer Lewis Pugh on his ice swim in Nepal, and Dr Darryl Wood, both specialists in altitude acclimatization and hypothermia treatment. Charl Rorich of Media Ventures is our camera man and Sean Disney of Adventure Dynamics International our expedition leader. Sean has summited the 7 highest volcanoes in the world as well as Mt Everest. 
SWIMMERS: Jean Craven (founder), Milton Brest, Evan Feldman, Chris Marthinusen,  Herman van der Westhuizen, Robert Graaff, Juandre Human.


           
                         
EXPENSES for the swimmers' trip is carried by themselves, which is their personal contribution to the cause! We are very fortunate to have corporate sponsors helping us cover the remainder of expenses including the safety costs so that donations benefit our charities 100%.
WHAT WE NEED
As we go for the extreme, we need to contribute where it counts. We will do the highest swim to bring change in desperate children's lives. And we hope to inspire you to donate towards this highest cause. 
Complementary to additional fundraising drives, we hope to raise $30 000 (400 000 ZAR) with our Indiegogo campaignto benefit Madswimmer's selected registered children's charities. This is your chance to donate! 
WHAT YOU GET
A contribution could qualify you for any of our cool perks like the proud Madswimmer t-shirt below. 

                                    
However, Thomas James said: ""Act as what you do makes a difference. It does."" Contributing towards our cause earns you these amazing testimonies by our charities - the real gift behind the smokescreens of our perks: 
Hospivision: ""One of the most distressing things that can happen to a family is when a child 
is diagnosed with a life-threatening illness such as cancer or aids.  Madswimmer funds enable us to provide care, counselling and hope for disadvantaged, sick children and their families in state hospitals.""
 
Miles for Mercia: ""Funding therapeutic equipment, like the bike for little Mason, brought relief and abundant joy for many cerebral palsy sufferers and their parents""

                                                                                                                    
Seal Trust: ""Your contributions provided swimming programmes among disadvantaged communities where drowning of children is a frequent reality""

NSRI Waterwise: ""Your money save lives. We teach children in poor communities basic water safety and how to rescue a friend in trouble""

                                                                                                  
Chilren's Hospital Trust: ""Fahiema was left paralyzed after being hit by a taxi in 2014.  Madswimmer helped fund her rehabilitation and now, one year later, she is able to walk, talk and eat by herself again. 


Bram Fischer Trust: ""Your funds benefited a very talented young gentleman at Grey College. He is an excellent rugby player and athlete who represented the Free State in both activities. He comes from a humble shack in the Goldfields where he lives with his 85 year old grandmother. Without your help this gifted child's talents might have been buried with his deceased parents"".
SAFV: ""Madswimmer support enables us to enroll children's home matriculants for tertiary studies after leaving the safe haven of the children's home. There is a fine line between being on track or on the street. Your funds help to keep them on track and to look forward to a brighter future!"" 
WACDT:  ""Madswimmer funding enabled the Waenhuiskrans/Arniston Community Development 
Trust to award study bursaries to Amanda Afrika (BSc), Roxzanne Flynn (nursing) and Bevan Arendse (secondary school). These students excelled in their studies and have hope for the future."" 
Foodbank: ""Your contributions help us to feed over 110 000 people a day who can't afford proper meals. 44% of our beneficiaries are children between 0 and 13.""
Jan Hofmeyer Trust: Thank you Madswimmer for helping us to provide pre-school development for 24 children from the Jan Hofmeyer community who, without your support, would not have had access to this essential foundation."" 
ORT SA: With Madswimmer support we trained young learners at the Hector Peterson Secondary School in an extremely poor area outside Kraaifontein to understand the basics of critical thinking to succeed in mathematics and science. One member, now in matric, plans to become a pilot!""                                                     
                                               
THE
IMPACT

Lets call it a joint effort: Madswimmer inspires, one stroke at a time and donors are the enablers that lead our children into greatness.  
RISKS AND CHALLENGES 
All our swims pose risks. Otherwise we wouldn't have done it! But with at least 10 daring attempts under our belt, giving up is not an option. The financial risk is the swimmers' own. Public money benefits registered children's charities 100%.

K-Pop is a sleek, chic and clean musical genre that has in the past 10 years amassed a growing global following. The fact that it is in a completely different language has not prevented its growth but in reverse opened the door to millions choosing to learn the language. This, and the rising popularity of K-Pop has resulted in a boost of visitors from around the world to South Korea to be at the epicenter of this thriving industry, and of course, get a closer look at the K-Pop stars that they love. <br/><br/>At TGM Entertainment, we want to make K-Pop concerts and acts more accessible to the rest of the world. We want to bring great concerts out of South Korea and replicate them in different areas of the world, focusing on Southeast Asia and North America which are strong, developing markets. We plan to venture out into Europe and the United Kingdom in 2015.<br/><br/>Our aim is to grow this industry beyond what it is today to not only ensure the sustainability of our business, but to generate more opportunities for other businesses and individuals to be a part of this cultural phenomenon.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why this campaign?</h3>
<div>To procure acts and bring them across the globe, there are a multitude of costs involved. While the return is extremely rewarding, the risks are high. The business of concert promotion relies on an airtight marketing and financial strategy to sell tickets and hit targets, which is ultimately how we generate profit.<br/><br/>The way that investment into a concert series works, is that promoters will fund the entire cost beforehand and recoup their investment through ticket sales. Without the right team to promote the event and the experience to keep a reign on budgets, many inexperienced promoters have phased out after just one project because they take such a major financial hit.</div>
<div>This campaign mitigates the risk of upcoming projects by giving us a ready market to approach with a concert. The more funding we have, the more cities we can head to. <br/><br/>While fans are spread out across different cities in America, funding will allow us to do more shows and more frequently, so the chance of a K-Pop concert coming to a city close to you as opposed to just major cities, is much higher.<br/><br/>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>How Much Do We Need and What Do You Get?</h3> <ul> <li>On average, a typical idol group concert costs $150,000 per city to produce. Promoters tend to shy away from producing shows if they do not foresee the potential in making their money back. A city like New York or Los Angeles, is more likely to sell more tickets, therefore a higher volume of concerts in those cities. We are looking to raise just half of what is needed for a five-city tour that we have planned with a popular male idol group that we have worked with previously. We want this to be a joint effort, half funded by us and half funded by fans. We plan to take the tour to New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco/Los Angeles.<br/><br/>
</li> <li>VIP tickets typically range from $200 - $120 dollars and are also the most difficult to acquire as the competition to purchase these tickets is high. Purchasing ahead of time ensures that you get your ticket first with a number of other perks like early entry to the concert, meet and greet with the artist and discounts on merchandise. You also have the option of redeeming a free Standard or General Admission ticket for a friend to the same concert, or redeeming a free Standard or General Admission ticket for yourself to attend another TGM Entertainment Event, even if it is before this particular tour.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">If we do not meet our funding goal, the money you have contributed will still go towards funding this tour. However, we will remove one stop from the five-city plan. It is important that you include your address in your contribution, because it lets us know where in the USA you are and the higher the chance of us coming closer to you!</span></li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>How does this make a difference? </p> <ul> <li>Every contribution to this project is not only a pledge of trust by you to us, but also a commitment and investment to helping us make this project succeed. The more successful this project, the better chance we have of returning quickly with another project. Typically, we have one show every other month. We have not had a track record of remaining stagnant with no shows. Even if you are not a K-Pop fan, do come out and experience something completely new! We promise it will be a ton of fun.<br/><br/>
</li> <li>We have not been in this industry for a long time, but every concert that we have done, we have had an amazing track record with fans. We do our absolute best to keep fans and our artists happy because we know that we would not be here without either of you. We are known to be a company that treats the artists and their fans with the utmost respect and we want to continue doing this.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Why Us?</h3> <p> We know that there are risks, and that we are not able to please everybody, however our business is not to cut out risks and prevent challenges, but to solve the problems that come our way. </p> <ul> <li>Our team is comprised of extremely experienced individuals who have a very specific set of skills that tackle problems that come our way quickly and with no fuss. We believe in clear communication between ourselves, the artists and their agency as well as the fans who come to our shows.<br/>
</li> <li>Our team has always been behind the scenes of K-Pop events in the USA, the large scale ones to standalone tours. We provide artist care and coordination as well as the stage and technical production for different promoters and have seen the problems and challenges fans and media go through. Through a successful campaign, the power is put in our hands to change things and make things better. We aim to do the things other promoters have done in the past, but we want to do it right.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We know that not everyone has the means to contribute, but we thank you for your time anyway. If this is something you believe in, you can help us by spreading the word. Every bit of exposure helps!</p> <ul> <li>Every 5 contributors you refer to us, you get one free GA/Standard ticket. The contributor will need to e-mail us at hello@tgmevents.com with proof of their contribution, and state your name and e-mail address as the beneficiary of the free concert ticket. Once 5 contributors have e-mailed us with your name, we will send you an e-mail notifying you of your free ticket.</li> <li>OR! If you are a group of contributors that know of someone who deserves a ticket, you can also nominate a person to receive a free ticket from us.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges We Still Face</h3> <p> In spite of this campaign, and your generosity, we still face many challenges.  Firstly, even if we hit our goal in this campaign, we still will need considerably more funding to become fully operational.  Hitting our goal of $150,000 will be quite the accomplishment, but we will only net an approximate $64,500 from it after taxes, the cost of perks, and campaign fees.  We want to maintain strong financial health and reduce any amount of debt that we will inevitably have to take on to reach our actually projected $119,000 startup costs.  </p>
<p>Secondly, this is our first business venture and there is a lot to learn.  We have strong educations in business, and even stronger leadership and management experience, but all new entrepreneurs find themselves confronted with unique challenges associated with running a business.  </p>
<p>Thirdly, we are doing what we can to partner with the best people to help us develop our prototypes, and ultimately our final renditions, for our new product lines as well as find high quality manufacturers that abide by a strong social responsibility to produce them.  Developing these partnerships, as with any form of relationship between two separate entities, presents its own challenges.  We want to make sure that we are aligned with the right people, so that the development iterations are kept to a minimum and we can deliver the best product to our customers as soon as possible.</p>

<p>We also know that aside from our education and experience, our passion and the innate ability to adapt and overcome, developed from many years of serving in the armed forces, allows us a strong position to overcome these challenges.  We are confident that we will succeed, as evident especially due to the strong support we have gained from you.  Thank you!</p>

Mezoco is Authentic

Mezoco is Tacos

Think Carnitas... slow fried pork shoulder, melting in your mouth.
Think Chicken... marinated, zesty, and juicy.
Think Steak... spice rubbed, tender, with a perfect kick for you heat seekers.
Top it off with the Salsas Bar - Verde, Charred Chili, Pico, fresh vegetables, hot sauces, chilis, and more seasonal fresh options than you can load onto a single structurally sound taco...
But we know you'll do your best.  
Best of all, think about all that deliciousness being made in a place that gives back to the community.

The Mezoco Vision 
My name is Greg Cuoco and I am a chef, restauranteur, and former United States Marine.  I have over 15 years experience in the food-service industry...I've seen the good, the bad, and the ridiculous.  I've got my bachelors degree in business management from Rutgers University in Newark as well as 2 successful business models I've set up for other companies which are now thriving restaurants.  
Mezoco was born out of a desire not only to get some great tacos (we really love tacos) but to create a business that grows and flourishes through helping its employees and its community flourish. 
What do these things have to do with each other? 
Great restaurant employees make great food. 
Great working environments make great restaurant employees. 
By providing comprehensive, ongoing, on-the-job training, creating real growth opportunities within the business and offering a livable wage for our employees we can build the kind of business that people will want to work for. The kind of place that makes people hungry to work (and not just for the tacos).
When your chef/server/busboy isn't worried about how they're going to make rent, they can put all of their energy into giving you the best taco experience you have ever had.


If you love Tacos...DONATE!  If you love helping people...DONATE!  If you love being at the start of a movement...DONATE!If you still love Tacos... DONATE AGAIN!

WHAT WORKS FOR SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSES IS SIMPLE:

It needs to be about the people:


Feed people great food at a reasonable price;
Train your staff continuously and comprehensively;
Give the guest a new best experience every time they walk in the door;
Make what we are doing about community, not just profits;
We are already teamed up with the Community FoodBank of New Jersey!!!  We want to make sure EVERYONE gets fed.


What my true inspiration has to say about all this...




The magnitude of what this can achieve is staggering.  One location gives jobs,  training to roughly 10 people, and gives back to local charities.  That's 10 people making enough money to support themselves and grow.  In addition, for every $1,000 donated to the Community FoodBank of New Jersey that is $10,000 worth of food given to those in need.  Double that and you have 20 people making great money and $20,000 worth of food being provided. AND TWICE AS MANY PEOPLE HAVING ACCESS TO AMAZING TACOS!



Idealistic. SURE IS! Realistic. DEFINITELY! The only thing stopping so many people from making enough money to live well and grow is an outdated way of doing business.  This gives all people from all walks of life a chance at the American dream.  Not everyone can go to college, but that doesn't mean they aren't hard working.  Train them, set the bar high, and expect nothing less.



Let's help those less fortunate by feeding them great food, great jobs, and the opportunity for a great future.


   What We Need & What You Get We are looking to raise $75,000 to help bring this business to life.  We already have $10,000 in the bank of our own money.  This along with all additional proceeds will go directly to start-up costs of equipment, inventory, uniforms, and most importantly, training our staff.

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;"">The big news!</span><br/>
</h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Aloft has risen over the last ten years from humble beginnings to become one of the largest physical theater and contemporary circus schools in the county.  While we love the building we called ""home"" for the past 8 years it has inhibited us in some ways, namely because it is located in an industrial zone.  We're ready to pack up our trapezes and sparkly unitards and move into our own building -- one that will allow us to offer classes to all ages of students, public performances for the community, access for variably-abled persons, and more!  In order to do that we're reaching out to you.  We found the perfect forever home in a 107 year-old church in the Logan Square neighborhood of Chicago and beat out a number of real estate developers vying to turn that church into condos.  We have the down payment covered, but need your help in covering the cost of renovations and re-zoning.</span></p>
<h3>Wait...what?!? Seriously?</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Yes. Seriously. In 2005, Shayna Swanson began Aloft with $5000 in her pocket, a loan from a dedicated student and friend. With that small investment she leased a small garage space in an alley in Humboldt Park. Aloft remained in the space for 2 years, then moved to a small business incubator space on the West Side of Chicago. The company has subsequently expanded to a 13,000 square foot facility in the same building.</span></p>
<p>However, Aloft has been facing the bittersweet termination of our lease in that incubator space at ICNC. After meeting with our landlords and asking if that was negotiable, and maybe they could just do us a solid and let us stay forever, they said, “Nope, sorry, little birds. It's time to fly out of the nest”. They suggested we begin looking for new places to move as soon as possible to get the ball rolling. It’s not easy to find a building suitable for circus, with 30 foot ceilings, in neighborhoods that are at least as good as the one we are currently in and not in the suburbs and not 800,000 sq ft. There’s a lot of 18 ft barrel truss buildings, but that would be a downgrade. So, we started rolling the ball.</p>
<p>It rolled, pretty quickly, to 3324 W Wrightwood. We made them an offer and they accepted and we’ve gone under contract on the building. We are buying a 107 year old church! </p>
<p>While we love our home for the last 8 years, because of our location in an industrial district, we have been inhibited in some ways. Currently we do not offer classes for students under 18 because our zoning won’t allow it. We would like to offer public performances of our work in a venue licensed for such activities. Additionally, while we are on a good bus line, our distance from the train keeps quite a few students from accessing us. Locating the business in a more populated, bustling neighborhood would not only help us grow, but bring new business to the surrounding area as well. Our space needs are highly specific and very hard to find. In order to maintain the quality and uniqueness of our training we need to have a large open space with ceilings of at least 25 ft. Very few buildings meet these needs, and those that do are often located in industrial areas. Locating in a more central and accessible location will help our visibility in the city really blossom, attracting clients who will hire us for events in Chicago and beyond. </p>
<p>This building is a dream. Help it come true.</p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">The works and the perks</span><br/></p>
</div><div> <p>The building that we have found is the perfect combination of affordability, structure and accessibility. We've got the loan, we've got the downpayment, we've got a plan that helps us put more money in the ""making awesome shows"" pot, but now we come to you to ask for your help in paying for the renovations. Nothing major is necessary, but rigging in particular, is nothing to do on the cheap. We will be hiring Chicago Flyhouse, one of the country's top rigging companies to do our install. We also need to level the floor and finish out the basement apartment in the 2 flat. Plus little things, like paint, electric and a zoning lawyer.<br/></p>
<p>Our goal breaks down like this:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>$35,000 Rigging. As aerialists, we know that this is not the place to skimp. We will skimp on the pizza budget, but the rigging needs to be top notch, and fitting a 107 year old church with quality rigging is our biggest move in expense.</li>
<li>$15,000 Ceiling removal. The church currently has the most beautiful tin false ceiling. Our hope is that we can find a antique architectural salvage company to take the ceiling down and pay us for it...in which case this funding will go towards more rigging.</li>
<li>$20,000 Floor leveling and installation. The floor in the sanctuary slopes to the front over one foot from front to back. While this is great for seeing a church service, it's not so great for doing cyr wheel or tumbling. We need to level that floor out and install a spring dance floor in the basement studio, which is currently tile. Ouch.</li>
<li>$15,000 Basement apartment renovation. One of the amazing things about this property is the apartment building with 2 apartments. With this we can house students coming to our Full-time training program from out of town, as well as staff and artists who want to live 5 ft from where they train! No other circus school in the country can offer this. We plan to create a 3rd (legal) apartment in the basement. Rent from the apartments offsets our mortgage and allows us to put more money toward making and facilitating amazing work!</li>
<li>$7,000 Zoning. Unfortunately, you can't just wander into a church and start a circus school without convincing the neighborhood that its in their best interest. Which it OBVIOUSLY is. But, we need to get a zoning change. We have the support of many people in the community, and we have tons of academic research on our side about how much circus can directly benefit a community. It's really either us or condos. We have no doubt that this zoning change will happen...it's just going to cost money to hire a lawyer and file all the papers!</li>
<li>$8,000 Additional renovations. Namely, having the electric rewired. If we buy this place, the last thing we want if for it to burn down.</li>
</ul>
<div>For your generosity, you'll see circus grow and bloom in all new ways and places in Chicago. You'll be helping us design a state-of-the-art rigging system and a circus school that's easy to get to and safe to hang out in front of. But, really, what you want to know about are the perks, right? Trust me...no one has better perks.</div>

<p>In circus training, we fail everyday. Failing is part of learning, but you learn to pick yourself up, examine the details of what happened, determine where the problem was, and try again. And again. It's this tenacity that makes circus people different. When we perform, people say, ""DON'T YOU USE A NET!?!"" and are shocked when we say no. We create a system of nets within our own bodies and minds, accustomed to what could go wrong. The apparatus acts as our net by applying the correct wraps and locks. And we don't take a risk until we've determined that we can do something a million times close to the ground safely. </p>
<p>Sometimes, its more of a risk to not take one. To remain stagnant and complacent and not challenge yourself and not move upward. Sometimes staying too close to the ground is more dangerous than climbing. That's were Aloft is. We are at ""grow or die"". We've never been afraid to grow and we know that our community will catch us.</p>
<p><i>If for some terribly sad reason, we fall short on our goal, no one ever gets to do circus again....just kidding!!! This is circus, we will find a way to make it happen! We will do benefit shows, borrow against our swivel collection...whatever it takes!</i><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Growing into the city</span><br/></p>
</div><div> <p></p>
<p>When Aloft began we offered 4 classes per week. We now have over 50 classes per week. Two years ago we began a Full-Time Training Program for students who wish to pursue a career in physical theater and contemporary circus. We’ve since graduated two classes, 23 students in total, many of whom are now teaching and performing professionally for our company and others around the country. In our recreational classes, we teach over 250 adult students every week. Aloft employs 25 part time and three full time staff at highly competitive wages, as well as providing performers for events and shows around the world.</p>
<p>Aside from our initial loan of $5000, Aloft has never borrowed money and has grown significantly in gross revenue every year. We’ve never had a year end in the red. We attribute this success to many things--namely a slow, sustainable growth plan and the community environment that we foster in our studio. We have a loyal base of professional artists and students that expands every year. When people come to Aloft, they feel as though they have found more than just an exciting art form that also happens to provides a physical and mental workout...they feel as though they have found a family.</p>When you contribute to this campaign, you're essentially helping this family grow into the entire city. Leaving the industrial district will help us connect with more people, everyday. Aloft's visablity will grow, we will become part of the cultural landscape of Logan Square and Chicago and our work will be enriched in the process. Plus, you're ensuring that there will be a place for circus lovers to embrace their passion, though learning, performing or teaching for years and years to come.<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>

</div><div> <p>Even if you, personally, can't donate...we are sure you know someone who can. Won't you please share this with your social media world? Link to us on Facebook or Twitter. Or, come see us do a show, come take a class, or go see a circus whenever you can. It's an art form that needs your support as it grows in this country. Become a circus fan, if you aren't already. You'll be amazed at what's possible when people put their minds to something.</p>

It's really either us or condos. We have no doubt that this zoning change will happen...it's just going to cost money to hire a lawyer and file all the papers!
$8,000 Additional renovations. Namely, having the electric rewired. If we buy this place, the last thing we want if for it to burn down.

For your generosity, you'll see circus grow and bloom in all new ways and places in Chicago. You'll be helping us design a state-of-the-art rigging system and a circus school that's easy to get to and safe to hang out in front of. But, really, what you want to know about are the perks, right? Trust me...no one has better perks.

Isn't this a huge risk?

In circus training, we fail everyday. Failing is part of learning, but you learn to pick yourself up, examine the details of what happened, determine where the problem was, and try again. And again. It's this tenacity that makes circus people different. When we perform, people say, ""DON'T YOU USE A NET!?!"" and are shocked when we say no. We create a system of nets within our own bodies and minds, accustomed to what could go wrong. The apparatus acts as our net by applying the correct wraps and locks. And we don't take a risk until we've determined that we can do something a million times close to the ground safely. 
Sometimes, its more of a risk to not take one. To remain stagnant and complacent and not challenge yourself and not move upward. Sometimes staying too close to the ground is more dangerous than climbing. That's were Aloft is. We are at ""grow or die"". We've never been afraid to grow and we know that our community will catch us.
If for some terribly sad reason, we fall short on our goal, no one ever gets to do circus again....just kidding!!! This is circus, we will find a way to make it happen! We will do benefit shows, borrow against our swivel collection...whatever it takes!

Growing into the city
 
When Aloft began we offered 4 classes per week. We now have over 50 classes per week. Two years ago we began a Full-Time Training Program for students who wish to pursue a career in physical theater and contemporary circus. We’ve since graduated two classes, 23 students in total, many of whom are now teaching and performing professionally for our company and others around the country. In our recreational classes, we teach over 250 adult students every week. Aloft employs 25 part time and three full time staff at highly competitive wages, as well as providing performers for events and shows around the world.
Aside from our initial loan of $5000, Aloft has never borrowed money and has grown significantly in gross revenue every year. We’ve never had a year end in the red. We attribute this success to many things--namely a slow, sustainable growth plan and the community environment that we foster in our studio. We have a loyal base of professional artists and students that expands every year. When people come to Aloft, they feel as though they have found more than just an exciting art form that also happens to provides a physical and mental workout...they feel as though they have found a family.When you contribute to this campaign, you're essentially helping this family grow into the entire city. Leaving the industrial district will help us connect with more people, everyday. Aloft's visablity will grow, we will become part of the cultural landscape of Logan Square and Chicago and our work will be enriched in the process. Plus, you're ensuring that there will be a place for circus lovers to embrace their passion, though learning, performing or teaching for years and years to come.
Can't donate right now?
 Even if you, personally, can't donate...we are sure you know someone who can. Won't you please share this with your social media world? Link to us on Facebook or Twitter. Or, come see us do a show, come take a class, or go see a circus whenever you can. It's an art form that needs your support as it grows in this country. Become a circus fan, if you aren't already. You'll be amazed at what's possible when people put their minds to something.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

The bulk of this will be split between the permitting and licenses, which cost approximately $1500, and the initial bulk bottle purchase is $1000.

<li>I understand that not every campaign makes it to the finish line. While it would be humbling and honoring to surpass my goal, in the event it is not reached,my priorities lie in the permitting and licensing and the branding. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <ul> <li>My mission here is to create an all-natural product that is an alternative to the status quo of today's soft drinks and beverages. These tonics, if you will, are designed using quality ingredients, locally-sourced produce, and REAL sweeteners. While sugar is sugar, and should always be consumed in moderation, the sugars and sweeteners used in these elixirs are in their rawest forms and retain all of their nutritional elements. </li>
<li>Sodas and soft drinks were, at one time in our history, found in pharmacies across the nation. These beverages may have been recommended by physicians and pharmacists alike in order to ease certain ailments. Burly Beverages is committed to aligning itself with these principles. </li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Sacramento is considered one of the leaders in the Farm-to-Fork movement.

<li>Recently, Sacramento locals have enjoyed my monthly pop-up dinner event known as <i>Meatless Monday</i>. This tradition began with four close friends trying a new recipe in my apartment, and has grown exponentially in the past year or so.  The last event was held at a local establishment, <b>Old Ironsides</b>, and drew over 100 diners. Old Ironsides has allowed me to utilize these dinners as an opportunity to test market for a variety of my products, used as a mixer for cocktails, or on their own as sodas. At this events, I sold over 100 peach-honey shrub cocktails in under two hours. The success rate continues to increase with each event. </li>

<h3>Health Benefits/Ingredient Choices</h3>
<div><ul>
<li>The main reason I'm doing this is to offer a health minded alternative to the corn syrup, preservative laden sodas and soft drinks that line the shelves in practically every store. Burly Beverages presents a ""more than natural"" option. It's not quite kombucha, but it's closer to kombucha than it is modern sodas. </li>
<li>Sucanat sugar. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Sucanat is an alternative sweetener prepared by crushing the stems of sugar cane to extract the plant’s juice, and then turning the juice in a vacuum tunnel at high temperature to evaporate the water content. The dried whole food product is then milled to a powder that retains the same vitamin and mineral content as the original juice. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Sucanat is the only truly raw cane sugar product. Most brands of evaporated cane sugar are cooked to some extent. Typically, the extracted juice is boiled to a thick syrup that crystallizes as it cools and dries. Both Sucanat and evaporated cane products are healthier than refined sugar, which is further treated with lime or phosphoric acids, filtered, deodorized and bleached so that all nutrients are removed as molasses and only the simple sucrose remains. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">One cup of whole raw sugar contains 1 g of protein, 1,125 mg of potassium, 1,600 IU of vitamin A, 49.5 mg of vitamin C, 165 mg of calcium, 6.5 mg of iron, 0.2 mg of niacin and 48 mg of phosphorus.</span>
</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Vinegar. We've all heard that apple cider vinegar is good for us, it is a ph regulator in our gut and can help the body reach homeostasis by lowering blood sugar and increasing circulation. But, in my research, I've found that ALL vinegars have health benefits and they differ from one another. I take all of this into consideration when tinkering with my recipes. I blend these vinegars with one another to achieve maximum health benefit and flavor. </span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Other sweeteners. I also employ, molasses (which is where all of the minerals and nutrients end up after sugar is refined), maple syrup (which contains more anti-oxidents than blueberries) agave syrup and raw honey (the only food known to man that will never spoil). </span></li>

<h3>What Are Shrubs And Switchels?</h3>
<div><ul>
<li>Shrubs. Sounds like a small plant. But in this form, a shrub is a method of preserving fruit juice that dates back to the ancient egyptian culture. In our part of the world, shrubs date back to the colonial era. It was the only way to enjoy fruit juice after its prime before refrigeration was invented. The preservation method involves making a syrup of vinegar, fruit juice and sugar. These days, you mostly see shrubs on craft cocktail menus. But, I have found that they make nice refreshing sodas when mixed with seltzer or club soda. </li>
<li>Switchel. Originally called ""Haymakers Punch"", switchel is a traditionally non-carbonated soft drink not unlike the sports drinks we know today. But, this one ACTUALLY quenches thirst. Mid-day toiling in the hay fields, someone would inevitably bring out a jug of switchel for the workers to enjoy. It can be served warm, room temperature, or, ice cold (my favorite). At its core, switchel is apple cider vinegar. When mixed with molasses, maple syrup, or honey and a variety of spices, the flavor of switchel can vary greatly. </li>

</h3> <p>Nova Coffee Labs was founded by two best friends that met in detention, and later when on to starting a band. After college and living in different cities while working all along in specialty coffee shops, they would reunite every year with instruments in Central and South America to learn songs and seek out the best spots for espresso.                    </p>
<p>The coffee company was a constant discussion on long plane rides or on long hikes, but years later, when they both finally found themselves back home in Virginia looking for answers, there was only one thing left to do. With every penny that they saved from roasting and barista jobs, they bought some nifty coffee equipment and tools and built coffee bars from reclaimed wood and green coffee pallet wood. When they set out to lease a Main St. storefront, they realized it was financially impossible, so they cleaned and painted a residential garage and had it zoned for business storage and training. <img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Coffee at it's finest : game-changing coffees that will elevate your coffee experience and change the lives of coffee farmers worldwide! We're all in this together, so we proudly serve coffees that have been sourced from a Direct-Trade model. Please show us your support with a contribution to fund our project, or please contribute your time to letting your friends or networks know about what we are all about here at Nova Coffee Labs, and how they can help us to build our community as a community. Thanks a million in advance- We love you for it!

                                Our Story                                                    
 Nova Coffee Labs was founded by two best friends that met in detention, and later when on to starting a band. After college and living in different cities while working all along in specialty coffee shops, they would reunite every year with instruments in Central and South America to learn songs and seek out the best spots for espresso.                    
The coffee company was a constant discussion on long plane rides or on long hikes, but years later, when they both finally found themselves back home in Virginia looking for answers, there was only one thing left to do. With every penny that they saved from roasting and barista jobs, they bought some nifty coffee equipment and tools and built coffee bars from reclaimed wood and green coffee pallet wood. When they set out to lease a Main St. storefront, they realized it was financially impossible, so they cleaned and painted a residential garage and had it zoned for business storage and training. 

 
They reached out to several friends and local business to host popups, and got busy brewing for folks in Guitar Shops, Wine Bars, Grocery stores, and we were having the time of their lives: just brewing coffee for people and flabbergasting our guests that coffee could truly taste THIS GOOD! 

  This campaign is so important to us because it will help us turn our one of a kind ""Coffee Caravan"" into an instant success! 

We have been loading our bar, equipment, and product into 2 compact cars, but was recently reduced to just one, and it's been very time consuming, heavy, and risky for our equipment. Not to mention, we've had limited space in one small car and have had to leave important equipment behind. It has also imposed plenty of limitations on our abilities to make it happen more frequently. We started to receive emails, and text messages wondering where we were going to be several times a day, and led us to conclude that we needed an alternative solution to our mobility issues ~ we needed to build our bar on wheels!
With a small and portable coffee caravan, we could pull our entire bar out everyday as we are currently working with towns all over Northern Virginia to designate permits to setup as a food truck in the street, and will continue to host popups at vineyards and breweries, concerts, festivals and fairs as well as catering for private and events and parties (to find out more-visit our about section at www.novacoffeelabs.com ). We will also be able to reevaluate our higher prices for private party or wedding catering because it will involve far less setting up and labor. 

                     
 We have put together a solid team of baristas, techs, artists, videographers, and  and coffee industry professionals from Northern Virginia and Washington D.C. to help in designing our caravan to ensure reliability, convenience, consistency, precision, professionalism and awesome design. 
All we need now, is your help.   Let's break it down together :  We are going to need a total of $ 20,000 to meet our goal.                               THAT'S A LOT! We know tis' and that's why I am happy to explain why it's going to take that to make this whole thing happen.

</h3> <p>The Leadhills and Wanlockhead Railway is Britains highest adhesion railway. Situated in the village of Leadhills in the Lowther Hills, we are a registered charity staffed entirely by volunteers, with the aim of preserving, restoring, and running railway vehicles of historical and industrial significance.  <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We also run a train service every weekend from April till September, and enjoy educating visitors of all ages in various aspects of narrow-gauge railway operation.</span></p>
<p>  Our aim is to build a weather-tight storage shed for our rolling stock.  Our site is at 1450ft above sea-level and is subject to extreme weather during the winter.  At the moment we only have one shed in which to store, repair, and preserve all of our locomotives and stock.  As a result, many of our heritage items have to be left outside which leads to much quicker deterioration, and in many cases the loss of entire items of rare stock.  Making our target will mean that we can build a rolling stock shed to house the collection of carriages and locomotives we have and free up the engineering shed to serve the purpose it was intended for: Vehicle maintenance, repair and restoration.  It will also serve to store our items awaiting restoration, thus removing them from the harmful effects of the extreme weather.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The shed we would like to build is of a similar design to our current engineering shed.  It is an arched structure, which is designed to withstand the strong winds we experience up at 1450ft.  It is of aluminium construction, which means it will not rust and it requires minimal maintenance.  The cost of the shed is £18,000 and we would also need to have a ring foundation constructed to secure it to the ground. In total we need £31,000.  The money that we raise will aid us to get match funding from other sources such as the Clyde Wind Farm Fund or the Heritage Lottery Fund.</p>
<p>There are a few ways we would like to thank you for any donations received:</p>
<p>£10 - You will be personally thanked in our regular newsletter.</p>
<p>£30 - You will be granted an Adult Membership of the railway which entitles you to free train rides any weekend during our operating season. (excluding special events)</p>
<p>£50 - You will be granted a Family Membership which entitles you and your immediate family to free train rides any weekend during our operating season. (excluding special events)</p>
<p>£75 - You will be granted an Adult Membership and your choice of a Polo Shirt or a Beanie Hat with the railway logo on it.</p>
<p>£100 - You will be granted an Adult Membership and a Driver Experience day, where you will spend the day at the controls of one of our heritage diesel locomotives.</p>
<p>Any money we raise will be used as match funding, so your contributions will be worth double to the railway.  We have recently been granted money from the Clyde Wind farm to buy a Tamping Machine, which was matched by donations. This was necessary for the maintenance of the track and cost £24,000.<br/></p>

<h3>The Importance of Independent Artists</h3>
</div>
<div>
<div>Independent artists have always been an integral part of the fabric of American society. While it used to be common for artists and artisans to make a living at their chosen craft (even if it was a modest one), the shift toward mass consumerism has made this more difficult. Mosts artists are drawn to their craft first and foremost for the love of the work. Some people create art for display; I create wearable art. I am proud to create pieces of jewelry that spring from surprising sources of inspiration (see my Clarendon Line) and that will go on to be part of someone's story. That is why true art is rarely discarded. Far more often, a cherished piece of art is passed on to someone else. It is meaningful because it was created by someone who truly cares about the work as much as the profit. Fortunately, there is a renaissance underway and Americans are rediscovering the joy of owning art that was created by hand, with love. Thank you for helping me be a part of it.</div>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Q&amp;A with Michelle</span></h3>
<h3>
<span style=""font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">How did you start making jewelry?</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>I started making jewelry about 17 years ago with beading and wire wrapping.  I did it on and off for years but never tried to sell my pieces.  Then about 4 years ago I decided I wanted to expand my skills and I took a soldering class.  I was hooked.  I took more classes and practiced my skills whenever I had a free moment.  I absolutely love working with metal and creating what I like to call mini sculptures!  </p>
<p><b>How do you select the materials you work with?</b></p>
<p>I choose the materials by playing with them.  I usually take out a bunch of materials and push them around together and hold them in different ways. Usually I will get a feeling for what I want to create.  I love to figure out how to make certain materials work together.</p>
<p><b>What three words describe your design aesthetic?</b></p>
<p>Three words...  modern, geometrical, industrial.  These are words I have heard others use to describe my pieces and I would agree.</p>
<p><b>What do you know to be true about creating quality jewelry?</b></p>
<p>I believe that to create quality jewelry you have to really love what you do.  It is important to me to create pieces that I love.  If I don't love the pieces then how can I expect someone else to.  I also won't create jewelry if I am angry or upset about something.  I know this sounds goofy but i feel like we put our energy into the things we make and I don't want to impart negative energy on anyone.  With that being said, I love creating jewelry so it is rare that I am angry while in my studio.  :)  I also think to create quality jewelry you need to not be afraid to push boundaries and try something new.  It is art and art is never wrong!</p>
<p><b>Where did the name Kenneth Pierre come from?</b></p>
<p>Kenneth was my father and Pierre was my grandfather.  The name is my dedication to them!</p>
<br/>
</div>

I started making jewelry about 17 years ago with beading and wire wrapping.  I did it on and off for years but never tried to sell my pieces.  Then about 4 years ago I decided I wanted to expand my skills and I took a soldering class.  I was hooked.  I took more classes and practiced my skills whenever I had a free moment.  I absolutely love working with metal and creating what I like to call mini sculptures!  
How do you select the materials you work with?
I choose the materials by playing with them.  I usually take out a bunch of materials and push them around together and hold them in different ways. Usually I will get a feeling for what I want to create.  I love to figure out how to make certain materials work together.
What three words describe your design aesthetic?
Three words...  modern, geometrical, industrial.  These are words I have heard others use to describe my pieces and I would agree.
What do you know to be true about creating quality jewelry?
I believe that to create quality jewelry you have to really love what you do.  It is important to me to create pieces that I love.  If I don't love the pieces then how can I expect someone else to.  I also won't create jewelry if I am angry or upset about something.  I know this sounds goofy but i feel like we put our energy into the things we make and I don't want to impart negative energy on anyone.  With that being said, I love creating jewelry so it is rare that I am angry while in my studio.  :)  I also think to create quality jewelry you need to not be afraid to push boundaries and try something new.  It is art and art is never wrong!
Where did the name Kenneth Pierre come from?
Kenneth was my father and Pierre was my grandfather.  The name is my dedication to them!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<li>

<li>

<li>
<b>Brand new building:</b> And it is already fully occupied, except this space. Ample parking, clean well lit spaces and entryway, and a good looking building. Not a sketchy warehouse area! Customers will feel comfortable coming here whether they just drove 50 miles our walked in from across the street.</li>
</ul>
<div>We need to raise money quickly for the lease down payment, permit and to start the design &amp; planning process for the cafe. </div>

</div>
<p>Thanks to supporters of our first Indiegogo campaign about 20 months ago, our Solar Powered Farmer's Market Coffee bar has been very successful. We have gone from just barely breaking even last year to running at a healthy profit this year. I, Amelia Loftus, the owner-operator, have fully supported myself financially with this business for over a year now! We are at 4 different farmer's markets every week. Check out our schedule <a href=""http://www.hiddenfortressfarm.com/coffee_booth.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here.</a></p>
<p>However, I have nearly reached capacity of what I &amp; my little 2 pound coffee roaster can handle. I am roasting 6-20 batches a day plus doing 4-5 farmer's markets a week plus a weekly delivery day. This equates to working 80 hour weeks! </p>
<p>To grow I'll need some help. My goal is to open a cafe first to bring in extra revenue and create a few jobs (Barista &amp; Farmer's Market Manager) so I have skilled help for daily operations. Once this is running smoothly we'll install a larger coffee roaster to speed up production and expand our ability to serve wholesale customers.  </p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>

<h3> What We Need <br/>
</h3>
<div>
<p>Building a Roastery and Cafe is no small project. To make it more attainable, I am planning the project in 3 phases:</p>
<b>Phase 1 by October 1st:</b><span> Secure space lease, apply for needed permits, and plan the cafe. Cash needed: $10,000. We hope to raise most of this through this Indiegogo campaign &amp; small private loans from friends and family. If we exceed this goal the additional funds will go towards phase 2.</span>
</div>
<div>
<span><b>Phase 2 by January 2016: </b>Get financing to build the cafe and build it. Cash needed: Approximately $35,000. Funding through </span>crowd funding, small loans, and equipment financing.</div>

<div>Your support of our project really does directly support small scale farming. Most directly, our own small poultry and fruit tree farm just south of Watsonville. On it's own our farm is not yet profitable but coffee sales for the past few years have made it possible to keep it going. </div>
<div>All our coffee purchases are made as conscientiously as possible: we only buy excellent coffees grown by small scale organic farmers. We want our coffee dollars to support family based, small scale ecologically conscious farming as much as possible. We plan to highlight this in our Watsonville coffee bar. We want to show our own farming community that we support small scale farming everywhere, and it is part of our mission to give back, however we can! </div>
<div>First, we have to build it. I have the experience and the confidence to know we can succeed.</div>
<div>Before I started this small farm based coffee business in early 2012, I spent 15 years at the helm of a homebrew supply business, Seven Bridges Cooperative, in Santa Cruz California. I was an original founding Member and served as the General Manager and Board President until I departed in 2011. I also cut my teeth on coffee roasting at Seven Bridges. I set up and developed the home coffee roasting section of the business. The business is still thriving today. Visit the <a href=""http://www.breworganic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Seven Bridges Website</a> to learn more about this business.</div>
<div>I have applied this extensive business experience for the past 3 years to building our coffee business which now provides all of my income. By building the coffee bar and roastery, we'll be able to grow the business enough to make it a true family business that can support both myself, my husband Patrick, and a small staff in the years to come.</div>
<div><br/></div>
</div>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>There are always risks! We have been planning to start down the path of expansion, but were not sure we were ready. This year is the first profitable year we have had on the books, and it is not over yet so we do not have tax returns that show profitability yet. This makes it difficult to qualify for traditional bank financing, even though we are homeowners and have excellent credit ratings.</div>
<div>On the other hand, we have sustained consistent growth of 50% over last year without really adding new sales outlets except a couple of new wholesale accounts. Because of the limited capacity of our coffee roaster, we have just about maxed out what we can handle, and have put seeking out new wholesale accounts on hold.</div>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440175955/nyvt7mtxfxoik8i7b6xt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<div>People love our coffee and keep coming back for more. And telling their friends! It's growing organically. We have been working hard to do our best to make sure every customer is happy with our coffee drinks and roasted coffee, and building it slowly.</div>
<div><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">However, this commercial space presents an opportunity we cannot ignore, and to take advantage of the opportunity, we have to jump at the chance. It is the last space in this building, and every instinct I have screams ""THIS IS IT!""</span></div>
<div><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">I know it is a big leap and the next 6 months will provide many challenges. The biggest challenges are financial. But I am confident that if we make the first hurdle, and raise the $10k needed to secure our location, the rest will happen. The ball will be rolling, and I am ready for the ride!</span></div>

This makes it difficult to qualify for traditional bank financing, even though we are homeowners and have excellent credit ratings.
On the other hand, we have sustained consistent growth of 50% over last year without really adding new sales outlets except a couple of new wholesale accounts. Because of the limited capacity of our coffee roaster, we have just about maxed out what we can handle, and have put seeking out new wholesale accounts on hold.

People love our coffee and keep coming back for more. And telling their friends! It's growing organically. We have been working hard to do our best to make sure every customer is happy with our coffee drinks and roasted coffee, and building it slowly.
However, this commercial space presents an opportunity we cannot ignore, and to take advantage of the opportunity, we have to jump at the chance. It is the last space in this building, and every instinct I have screams ""THIS IS IT!""
I know it is a big leap and the next 6 months will provide many challenges. The biggest challenges are financial. But I am confident that if we make the first hurdle, and raise the $10k needed to secure our location, the rest will happen. The ball will be rolling, and I am ready for the ride!
   Other Ways You Can Help Even if you don't have much time or money, your support really means a lot to me. Your moral support will help sustain us through the challenges ahead. Also you can:  Please help get the word out! Share on Facebook, tell your friends, buy a coffee at one of the Farmer's markets. It's easy to share my campaign, just use the Indiegogo share tools.

</p><p>More than a year and a half have passed since Resign
launched its first fundraising campaign. Successively gathered more than
$6000usd, invested in getting some tools and material, renting out a workplace,
to try and experiment upcycling waste, turning it into useful products…then the results were amazing.</p>
<p>The products were unique and satisfying, and more people
started to trust Resign's work. We went into making decorations, furniture,
accessories, and more.</p>
<p>Resign have
participated in many exhibitions, and conducting several training sessions and
workshops, involving more people in this great project which wouldn’t have came
to life without the trust given from people to me as a person, Ala Hilu.</p>
<p>After 3 years of working on developing new ways to treat
waste, creating many useful things out of different kinds of waste, observing
the process of creation, and understanding the relation between what is possible
and what is available as in machinery, human capacity and waste (raw material),
I have reached several conclusions that can make Resign a better place with
better service and better products, in addition, With a wider vision to spread upcycling
faster and make it more accessible for people. This needs your support again…
so, lets go practical  <span></span></p>
<p>We need to get specialized Tools and machinery that would
get the place to be more tidy, more organized and more professional . Its true we have done so much with the basic
tools we have, but having more professional and powerful tools, with a new
variety of tools<span></span>, Resign would be able to get into another level of perfection and easy production. Most of
the tools we have are made for light work, and if used harder, would probably
be lost. </p>
<p>More reasons for machines </p>
<p><span>* <span></span></span>Cooperation with other
organizations…Now with SkateAid and SkatePal …Skate parks </p>
<p>SkateAid and SkatePal have been working on building several skate
parks around the West Bank, now there are four of them around, well designed,
beautifully built and greatly functioning, but, the kids and the participants
have to wait for skateboards until they come from abroad…once we found the idea
of BucketBoard, we got inspired, we have the
experience to be able to make them, but not the equipment.</p>
<p>Such work will be a kind of completing the work of other
organizations, and supporting it. This time, we will work together with
SkateAid and SkatePal, and see how to bring this dream true…. Our manufacturing
and recycling experience together with their professional astonishing  skating skills..<span></span></p>
<p>In the future, when Resign gets the mentioned tools, we will be able to strengthen this kind of
cooperation between Resign and other organizations to replace their needs with
upcycled goods. As at that point, Resign will be able to go for bigger projects<br/></p>
<p><span>* <span></span></span>Upcycling more, Upcycling
better</p>
<p>Better machines mean better quality products, less time and
effort in preparation  and less waste of
material…. For example, 2 machines of what we aiming for, can prepare and render pallet
wood with less effort, less mess, less time and less waste, in addition, it can be way safer to use these machines by
beginners than our current technique with circular angle grinder!</p>
<p>There are machines that have multiple purposes and can be
used in treating different kinds of waste</p>
<p><span>*<span> 
</span></span>Training sessions: </p>
<p>Building a more professional training space, with tables and
tools with easy access for 6 trainees at a time, will make it possible for
Resign to host trainings and recruit more people who would like to develop
their upcycling skills, especially when the machines are safe to use…most of
our work depend on angle grinders, but it is not safe to give it to beginners
to work with.</p><p> There are machines that won’t be dangerous when
given to beginners after showing them how they work.!</p>
<p><span>*<span>

<p>Opening a shop where people can come look at the products in
a tidy, clean and  nice set-up. Spending some time to understand the

<p><span>*<span>

<p>It is true we can find many upcycling ideas on the web, but
not everyone here speaks English to understand how it works. And through my search, I didn’t
find any similar idea in our market. So, the idea here is to photograph and
film everything we do at Resign with these new and safe machines, and collect
them in a book to show people how they can benefit from waste.</p>
<p>This book will (when it can be published) provide
information about healthy ways of treating waste. Moreover, it will include

</div></div>","Jess's Story



In December 2015 I will be going to Uganda for 6 weeks to volunteer in the small town Jinja, 80km northeast of the capital Kampala. 

I will spend my time working between the local hospital, medical clinics, orphanage and the Discovery Centre run by the charity Youth With A Mission.
My goal is to use my experience and skills in health care, along with my love for children and compassion for those in need to contribute to the well being of this community. 
""Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I said, here am I! Send me""               -Isaiah 6:8

I need YOUR help
 Although I have worked hard to self-fund my entire trip, I need money to significantly contribute to the well being of the people of Jinja.
The aim is to raise $10,000 
This may sound like a large sum, so lets break it down...





$4,000 will build a small house for a widow and her children, who are currently homeless with no safe shelter
The remaining $6,000 will be distributed in the following ways to improve the wellbeing of the community:
$2,000 to provide needed medical supplies /equipment for the local hospital
$2,000 for food relief to the community
$2,000 to improve the orphanage, provide the children with clothes/footwear and to run a Christmas event

Closer to my departure date and once I arrive in Uganda I will be keeping a regular and updated blog to detail how each and every dollar is spent $$$ so that YOU will know the direct impact your donation has had.
Please understand that 4% of your donation goes to Indiegogo as this was the cheapest crowd funding website I could find.

As I am going for christmas and new years I will be planning christmas activities and presents for the local children at Care for Kids Orphanage which funds will also support to make happen. More details to come soon :)  
The Impact EVERY child, EVERY human being deserves the right to BASIC HUMAN NEEDS, such as a safe shelter to call home, safe clean drinking water, health care, education and protection. 

Your donations will help to provide these basic human rights to the people of Jinja.
My trip to Uganda is so valuable to both the community of Jinja and myself. I believe that in offering my skills, labour, time and love to the people of Jinja I will also receive love, friendship and an incredible life experience in return.
I would like to mention that my trip is supported by my local church, the wonderful Reaching the Nations Christian Church and their long running charity Lost N Found, an Australian non-profit charitable aid and development agency with the purpose of helping vulnerable and helpless children, and restoring broken families. 
Lost N Found has been on many sucsessful missionary trips to Uganda and South America over the last 9 years, and also work in partnership with International Support Aid and Care For Kids Orphanage. I am very excited to represent both Reaching the Nations Christian Church and Lost N Fond through my mission.


PLEASE Donate & Share!!!!!
ALL donations will be very greatly appreciated. Please spread the word about my cause to all of your family and friends!
I will be keeping regular updates on my trip from now until I depart and return from Africa through my Facebook page and my blog (to be posted soon)

them.</p>

</h3>
<p>The three-story, 8-bedroom home, built in the 1900’s has been restored and
redecorated by Kansas City’s top designers and will provide residential housing
for women and their children recovering from substance use disorders.  <b>In April 2015 the house will open it's doors, housing up to 16 women and their children during their first 28 days of recovery.  It is the only program
in Kansas City that allows addicted mothers to bring their children with them
to treatment.<span>  <br/></span></b></p>
<p></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need <br/>
</h3>
<p>Help us make this temporary house feel like home to over 200 women and their children in recovery from from substance use disorders. Your contribution will help ReDiscover provide women and their children with access to basic amenities, food and a safe place to sleep. <br/></p> <ul>
<li>Household linens - new towels, blankets, pillows, and twin size bed linens</li>
<li>Small appliances - vacuum, toaster, can opener, and hand mixer<br/>
</li>
<li>Personal hygiene products - shampoo, conditioner, toothbrushes, toothpaste, soap, deodorant</li>

</h3> <p></p>Support of this campaign represents 
a proactive step in helping women develop and regain their ability to 
become financially self-reliant.  Helping women to break the cycle of 
familial 
substance use disorders reduces the costly need for medical and social services 
for their children now and into the future.  For each woman in 
recovery, 6 to 10 other lives are positively touched according to the 
national institute on Drug Addiction.   More than 1,300 lives a 
year will be enhanced by your gift.  Thank you for your consideration of giving to this important campaign.  </div> <div>

for women and their children recovering from substance use disorders.  In April 2015 the house will open it's doors, housing up to 16 women and their children during their first 28 days of recovery.  It is the only program
in Kansas City that allows addicted mothers to bring their children with them
to treatment.  

  What We Need 

Help us make this temporary house feel like home to over 200 women and their children in recovery from from substance use disorders. Your contribution will help ReDiscover provide women and their children with access to basic amenities, food and a safe place to sleep.  
Household linens - new towels, blankets, pillows, and twin size bed linens
Small appliances - vacuum, toaster, can opener, and hand mixer

Personal hygiene products - shampoo, conditioner, toothbrushes, toothpaste, soap, deodorant
Female hygiene products
Diapers
Sleepwear and packaged underwear - women’s and children’s
Kitchen items - pots and pans, casserole dishes, hot pads, measuring cups, dinnerware, flatware, and glasses
Laundry items - detergent, and softener
Toilet paper, tissue, paper towels, trash bags



    The Impact 
 Support of this campaign represents 
a proactive step in helping women develop and regain their ability to 
become financially self-reliant.  Helping women to break the cycle of 
familial 
substance use disorders reduces the costly need for medical and social services 
for their children now and into the future.  For each woman in 
recovery, 6 to 10 other lives are positively touched according to the 
national institute on Drug Addiction.   More than 1,300 lives a 
year will be enhanced by your gift.  Thank you for your consideration of giving to this important campaign.   


Other Ways You Can Help We know that not everyone can contribute financially, and that is okay. There are certainly other ways you can help. Raise awareness about the good work ReDiscover is doing by sharing with your friends, co-workers and company 
management:

<b>Wordique's Story</b><br/><br/>My father once told me to never stop dreaming or working towards that dream, and I remember these words as if he told me them yesterday. Often, I have to stop and remember them when things get tough or aren't working out. My father was a strong, logical, and intelligent man. He taught me a lot in the short time that I got to spend with him. When I was eleven, my father died of lymphatic leukemia but his advice still lives on inside me.<br/><br/>I'm sharing this personal story because it's the driving force behind Wordique. My ultimate goal is to help others work toward their dreams and help remind them every day to never <b>stop dreaming</b>. This is what keeps me going each day, even though at times it feels like I'm fighting an uphill battle. Also, the Wordique team shares my vision, values, and goals. It's great to work with like-minded people towards the same outcome.<br/><br/><b>Why is Wordique different?</b><br/><br/>Wordique is a custom built site designed for writing projects and editing services. It's a safe and secure platform, where we hold the funds till the final draft is complete. We help recommend writers or editors to new clients based on their needs, and we also never deduct a commission. Yes, you heard me right, our site is 100% commission free! Additionally, we'll never limit a writer to certain projects based on their experience. Wordique was primarily designed for new or inexperienced writers (even though all writers are welcome to sign up.) We're always there to offer career advice and encouragement. We'll help writers with their resumes, portfolios, and offer advice on their next step.<br/><br/>These are the key elements that allow us to stand out from all the other networking sites. We are NOT a content mill, and we actually care about all our clients. This isn't just a business, it's our PASSION! We realize behind every profile is a story and a dream.<br/><br/><b>We need your help!</b><br/><br/>Now that the site is up and running we need help with our marketing expenses. It's crucial that we earn enough funds my mid-May to be able to afford the marketing services so Wordique can be visible.  All of the funds we earn will go towards our marketing efforts. We have already mapped out the necessary services and expenses, and that's where we came up with the amount needed.<br/><br/>A detailed list of expenses is available upon request.<br/><br/><b>Where are we going?</b><br/><br/>My vision for Wordique is that it'll soon have a full database of writers and people seeking writing services.  In the future, we have plans to incorporate more creative networking services for filmmakers, graphic design artists, and other creative freelance professionals. However, we have to start out small and master only one thing at a time.<br/><br/>I'm confident Wordique will help writers get writing credits and build their resumes. This will allow them to move on to bigger and better things like writing for professional blogs, magazines, or newspapers. Maybe they'll even be able to land an agent because of the work they did on my site. :)  That would be AWESOME!<br/><br/><b>Other ways you can help</b><br/><br/>Every penny helps to spread the word, but if you are unable to give we understand.

<p><b>MY STORY</b><br/></p>
<p>At the age of 35, I became a <b>Family Court Judge of the first
Circuit of Hawai'i.</b></p>
<p>After retiring in 1999, I was elected to serve as the
<b>Lieutenant Governor of the State of Hawai'i</b> in 2002, proudly serving two full terms until 2010.</p>
<p>Serving my community in these various positions has
allowed me to see a glimpse of the future most people have not seen, I have
seen the corruption of our government and the downfall of family values.</p>
<p>Now, as President and CEO of Hawai'i Family Advocates I am on
a Mission to change all that!</p>
<p>Here’s where you come in….</p>
<p><b>WE NEED FUNDING...WHY?</b><br/></p>
<p>Currently, there is an <b>imbalance in state government</b>.  Our major media outlets in the press and television are tilted towards the
“new age” and liberal views.  We will be
that voice in the dark - the <b>voice that
will speak on behalf of those who have no voice</b>, the child in a mother’s womb,
those at life’s end, and for developing and strengthening families, <b>where
marriage is celebrated</b> as the core ingredient, as a priority. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>            <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448300116/iqdyb6ujmjunmufekszv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p><b>OUR MISSION</b><br/></p>
<p>Our Mission is to create a legacy organization that will be
the <b>voice for today’s and tomorrow’s generation</b>. It will be the resource for those who share
the beliefs and values of the sanctity of life and institution of
marriage. It will empower our electorate
and community at large with the knowledge, skills, and structure to deliver our
message and correct the imbalance in our media, state and federal
government.  </p>
<p><b>WE WILL DO THIS BY...</b>having a strong presence in state and
local government through lobbying, presenting testimony, facilitating public
support through rallies and gatherings, and by providing education on
legislation and policy that will affect our core values of family, faith and
freedom
</p>
<p><b><u>IN ORDER TO MAKE
THIS A REALITY WE NEED TO ACHIEVE OUR GOAL OF $50,000</u></b></p>
<p>Throughout most of my professional career, I have been asked
on many occasions as to what I thought was the best way to address and <b>solve
many of our social problems</b>. Whether it
was drug and alcohol abuse, teen pregnancy, juvenile delinquency, and/or
criminal conduct; simply put there are no magic bullets to our social ills.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448299763/c2ev5mdugvioctvv3omn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> However, there is no question based upon my experience as a family and circuit court
judge, lieutenant governor, father, grandfather, coach, and teacher that the
<b>family unit is the key ingredient</b> to building a person with the character,
integrity, and knowledge to be a law abiding and productive member in our

</div>","Aloha, I'm Duke Aiona, President and CEO of Hawai'i Family Advocates. Our mission is to advance our core values through education, lobbying, and electioneering.  Our world is changing rapidly, and I see a vision of Hawai’i where families are strong, all human life is valued, and religious liberty flourishes.  With your help, and my dedication to spreading the word, I know this can be possible!


OUR CORE VALUES ARE FAMILY, FAITH, & FREEDOM...
FAMILY 
In my case, I've been married for
34 years to Vivian Welsh Aiona. We have
four amazing kids and three beautiful grandchildren.  Hawai'i Family Advocates supports the marriage between one man and one woman, and traditional family values.
FAITH
We have been worshiping at Resurrection of the Lord
Catholic Church since 1983 and are involved in several church ministries.  We support religious liberty. 
FREEDOM
Finally, we champion for religious liberty.
We invite your support on this journey of bringing it all back to the core values of Family, Faith and Freedom.


MY STORY
At the age of 35, I became a Family Court Judge of the first
Circuit of Hawai'i.
After retiring in 1999, I was elected to serve as the
Lieutenant Governor of the State of Hawai'i in 2002, proudly serving two full terms until 2010.
Serving my community in these various positions has
allowed me to see a glimpse of the future most people have not seen, I have
seen the corruption of our government and the downfall of family values.
Now, as President and CEO of Hawai'i Family Advocates I am on
a Mission to change all that!
Here’s where you come in….
WE NEED FUNDING...WHY?
Currently, there is an imbalance in state government.  Our major media outlets in the press and television are tilted towards the
“new age” and liberal views.  We will be
that voice in the dark - the voice that
will speak on behalf of those who have no voice, the child in a mother’s womb,
those at life’s end, and for developing and strengthening families, where
marriage is celebrated as the core ingredient, as a priority. 

            

OUR MISSION
Our Mission is to create a legacy organization that will be
the voice for today’s and tomorrow’s generation. It will be the resource for those who share
the beliefs and values of the sanctity of life and institution of
marriage. It will empower our electorate
and community at large with the knowledge, skills, and structure to deliver our
message and correct the imbalance in our media, state and federal
government.  
WE WILL DO THIS BY...having a strong presence in state and
local government through lobbying, presenting testimony, facilitating public
support through rallies and gatherings, and by providing education on
legislation and policy that will affect our core values of family, faith and
freedom

IN ORDER TO MAKE
THIS A REALITY WE NEED TO ACHIEVE OUR GOAL OF $50,000
Throughout most of my professional career, I have been asked
on many occasions as to what I thought was the best way to address and solve
many of our social problems. Whether it
was drug and alcohol abuse, teen pregnancy, juvenile delinquency, and/or
criminal conduct; simply put there are no magic bullets to our social ills.


 However, there is no question based upon my experience as a family and circuit court
judge, lieutenant governor, father, grandfather, coach, and teacher that the
family unit is the key ingredient to building a person with the character,
integrity, and knowledge to be a law abiding and productive member in our
society.  
A strong family unit will also
be there to provide the support and help that a person will need when they are
at their darkest and most challenging moments. 
A person with a strong family unit will always know that he/she is not
alone and that they can always count on their family.  
Accordingly, for me I have been blessed with the opportunity
to serve in positions where I am able to promote, influence, or develop
programs or policy that strengthen the family. 

Hawai'i Family Advocates is another opportunity for me to
strengthen  families. 


WHY SUPPORT HAWAI'I
FAMILY ADVOCATES?
We are an organization whose vision is to create a world
where families are strong, all human life is valued, and religious liberty
flourishes.  This vision will be achieved
by advancing our core values of family, faith, and freedom through lobbying,
education, and empowerment.  
We will do this by
having a strong presence in state government through lobbying, presenting
testimony, facilitating public support through rallies and gatherings, and by
providing education on legislation and policy that will affect our core values
of family, faith and freedom. 

WHAT YOU CAN HELP CREATE  HFA will be that
organization for the believers of faith, principles, and values who treasure
the sanctity of life in the beginning and end of its cycle, the institution of
marriage and its divine and natural ability to procreate children, and a
structure that will be a credible voice in state government. HFA will empower its members on the issues of
today and with the knowledge and ability to articulate and advance its
arguments in support of their beliefs, values, and principles.  
By funding this project, you will create a world where
