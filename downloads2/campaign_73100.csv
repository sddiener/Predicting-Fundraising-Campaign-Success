<p><span>People I've had the honor to cook for always ask me, “Why don’t you open a restaurant?” Well, I can finally say that I’m actually working on it. But there is still some work to do before I can do that, and I need your help to make it all happen. For me, it’s not only the idea of owning a restaurant that excites me. It’s the opportunity to tell a story through my food and pass on what I’ve had the privilege of learning about global foodways that make it so meaningful to me. </span></p>
<p>Meridio is the culmination of years of research, travel and cooking. I’ve wanted to own my own restaurant for a long time, but it wasn’t until recently that I found the perfect concept. I grew up in the kitchen, watching my great grandmother, grandmother, and mother cook American Southern and rustic Italian cuisine. Since childhood, I’ve been experimenting, learning and perfecting my personal cooking style. Growing up in Mississippi, I saw most of the state and had the opportunity to experience a large majority of the various ingredients, cooking techniques, and culinary cultures not only of Mississippi but of the entire American South as well. </p>
<p>I’ve worked in and around the restaurant industry throughout my life, albeit on the side. It wasn't until I visited the magical city of Cartagena, Colombia -- and fell in love with a beautiful woman there -- that I discovered the phenomenal flavors and cultures of South America. Through that discovery, I found a connection between the cuisines of South America and the American South that I never knew existed, and now I want to share this newfound knowledge with the world. </p>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Concept</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The name is a play on the Spanish word ""meridional,"" meaning southern. Meridio Southern-Latino is an innovative restaurant and bar featuring a rare and exciting blend of American Southern and South American cuisines and beverages.</span></p>The restaurant will offer diners a refined yet approachable dining experience with swift, knowledgeable service and affordable pricing. We'll use fresh, quality ingredients in all of our dishes and strive to source our meat and produce from community farmers, growers and other local and regional purveyors whenever possible. In addition, we’ll strive to source ingredients unique to geographic regions in South America  in order to maintain authenticity and sustainability, and to nurture the relationships between the U.S. and emerging economies in South America.<p></p>
<p>By combining the various native ingredients and presentation methods of these wonderful regions, we create something entirely new, yet surprisingly familiar.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Why you?</h3> <p></p>
<p><span>Most dreams cannot become reality without the support of friends and family, and it takes a village to open a restaurant. Through Indiegogo, I am raising initial capital to fund the research and development phase of the start-up process. The business plan has been thoroughly vetted by business coaches and lending consultants, and the consensus is that the plan is sound. I just need to go out and find the collateral needed to obtain financing.</span></p>
<p>For banks and investors to really believe in me and my concept, I need to show that there is a market for Meridio. So, the R&amp;D phase will consist of one part underground supper club, one part private chef service. Highly valued feedback will be gathered and documented after each event, and a small but hopefully steady income will stream from the events and go towards the stretch goal of $200,000 needed for financing collateral.</p>
<p>To fund this phase, I need to raise $25,000 that will go toward purchasing cooking equipment, dishes, tables, storage, transportation and other items essential to the success of the R&amp;D project. The necessities are not unlike what a typical catering company uses. </p>

<p>De par mon
savoir Etre et savoir Faire, riche de diversités et de pluriactivités, j’ai
développé une grande rigueur, une qualité de présence et d’écoute.</p>
<p>De la
flexibilité, de l’enthousiasme et du plaisir dans tout ce que j’entreprends...</p>
<p>Ce qui me
décrit : dynamique, spontanée, créative, bienveillante, ferme, optimiste, empathique, pleine
d’humour... </p>
<p>Mon métier
aujourd'hui est de trouver des solutions économiques et humaines pour répartir
les richesses. Par la suite avec des équipes efficientes, nous les mettrons en
place. SMB 361 en est la première action. Cela a du sens pour moi, c'est ma
manière de contribuer à améliorer le monde.</p>
<p>SMB 361 est
un nouveau modèle de réseau Premium autour du milieu du Sport de Haut-Niveau
Montpelliérain. Il permet aux TPE/PME locales de pouvoir participer aux salons
VIP des sports majeurs, sans avoir à en payer les abonnements annuels parfois
trop coûteux pour leur structure.</p>
<p>L'adhésion
annuelle inclue les prestations suivantes:</p>
<p>-  Une
carte privilège (assimilable à un Comité d'Entreprise externalisé)</p>
<p>-  Une
autre visibilité, sur le net, plus performante</p>
<p>- Huit
rencontres « Business Afterworks »</p>
<p>- Deux
cycles de "" trois Business ateliers"" concrets</p>
<p> - Trois
rendez-vous « Business Events » pour accroître votre chiffre d'affaires.</p>
<p> - 
Une place VIP à l’ALTRAD Stadium</p>
<p> - Une
place VIP au Palais des sports René BOUGNOL.</p>
<p>Je me suis
intéressée à la situation des TPE en France, aux problématiques que nous
rencontrons pour pérenniser nos entreprises. QUOI et COMMENT faire pour
répondre aux impératifs du marché ?</p>
<p>Nous devons
travailler sur les attitudes et aptitudes, favoriser l'accès des places to be
dans le milieu sportif, lieux incontournables des Homme d'affaire.</p>
<p>Je contribue
ainsi à  améliorer le bouche à oreille et le travail de recommandations en
mutualisant les coûts.</p>
<p>J'ai fait le
choix d'associer Thierry Mouraux en charge de la communication (créateur du
logo et de la charte du SMB 361) et Sébastien TOURNIER le directeur. </p>
<p>Pourquoi eux
? Nous avons appris à nous connaître, nous partageons les mêmes valeurs et
avons une vision commune futuriste. Si je disparais demain, ils sont à même de
continuer le SMB 361 et de prendre les décisions appropriées. Ce que j'aime
c'est le plaisir et la richesse de nos échanges et en plus nous travaillons
dans la joie et la bonne humeur. Dans ces conditions créer est un plaisir et un
épanouissement personnel. </p>
<p>Je vous
invite à aller voir la page facebook du SMB 361 où je raconte l'histoire de la

<p></p></div>","Englsih version, get down please.ThanksBonjour,
De par mon
savoir Etre et savoir Faire, riche de diversités et de pluriactivités, j’ai
développé une grande rigueur, une qualité de présence et d’écoute.
De la
flexibilité, de l’enthousiasme et du plaisir dans tout ce que j’entreprends...
Ce qui me
décrit : dynamique, spontanée, créative, bienveillante, ferme, optimiste, empathique, pleine
d’humour... 
Mon métier
aujourd'hui est de trouver des solutions économiques et humaines pour répartir
les richesses. Par la suite avec des équipes efficientes, nous les mettrons en
place. SMB 361 en est la première action. Cela a du sens pour moi, c'est ma
manière de contribuer à améliorer le monde.
SMB 361 est
un nouveau modèle de réseau Premium autour du milieu du Sport de Haut-Niveau
Montpelliérain. Il permet aux TPE/PME locales de pouvoir participer aux salons
VIP des sports majeurs, sans avoir à en payer les abonnements annuels parfois
trop coûteux pour leur structure.
L'adhésion
annuelle inclue les prestations suivantes:
-  Une
carte privilège (assimilable à un Comité d'Entreprise externalisé)
-  Une
autre visibilité, sur le net, plus performante
- Huit
rencontres « Business Afterworks »
- Deux
cycles de "" trois Business ateliers"" concrets
 - Trois
rendez-vous « Business Events » pour accroître votre chiffre d'affaires.
 - 
Une place VIP à l’ALTRAD Stadium
 - Une
place VIP au Palais des sports René BOUGNOL.
Je me suis
intéressée à la situation des TPE en France, aux problématiques que nous
rencontrons pour pérenniser nos entreprises. QUOI et COMMENT faire pour
répondre aux impératifs du marché ?
Nous devons
travailler sur les attitudes et aptitudes, favoriser l'accès des places to be
dans le milieu sportif, lieux incontournables des Homme d'affaire.
Je contribue
ainsi à  améliorer le bouche à oreille et le travail de recommandations en
mutualisant les coûts.
J'ai fait le
choix d'associer Thierry Mouraux en charge de la communication (créateur du
logo et de la charte du SMB 361) et Sébastien TOURNIER le directeur. 
Pourquoi eux
? Nous avons appris à nous connaître, nous partageons les mêmes valeurs et
avons une vision commune futuriste. Si je disparais demain, ils sont à même de
continuer le SMB 361 et de prendre les décisions appropriées. Ce que j'aime
c'est le plaisir et la richesse de nos échanges et en plus nous travaillons
dans la joie et la bonne humeur. Dans ces conditions créer est un plaisir et un
épanouissement personnel. 
Je vous
invite à aller voir la page facebook du SMB 361 où je raconte l'histoire de la
création de SMB 361. www.facebook.com/smb361France/
Nos besoins
et vos contreparties
Aujourd'hui
ce modèle est inconnu en France, je ne saurais m'avancer pour le reste du
monde. J'ai besoin d'un coup de pouce afin de lever les doutes des membres
potentiels. B. CYRULNIK a précisé que le doute est le premier pas vers la
liberté. Vous savez comme moi qu'une grande partie de la population a peur de
l'inconnu. 
La somme
demandée aux donnateurs soit 11 200 €  va servir à couvrir : les frais
administratifs, ceux de la communication et une partie des abonnements des
places. Je souhaite multiplier par 5 la donation initiale afin de permettre à
 SMB 361 de prendre son essor et d'être franchisé en 2017.

Le lancement du SMB 361 a pour
     objectif de permettre aux TPE de générer du chiffre d'affaires. L'équipe
     du SMB 361 n'est constituée que de chefs d'entreprise. Nous souhaitons
     accueillir la collaboration d'un commercial indépendant pour le second
     semestre 2016.
Nous faisons appel aux dons. En
     devenant notre donateur,  avec un minimum de 150 €, vous avez la
     possibilité de choisir une entreprise du Languedoc Roussillon à laquelle
     nous offrirons une place supplémentaire au MHB.
 Le montant de la
     cotisation du SMB 361 étant de 1 592.4 € TTC, si votre contribution est
     supérieure ou égale à la cotisation,nous attribuerons une remise de 25% à
     une entreprise de votre choix.
A vous de nous mentionner si
     vous souhaitez apparaître sur le site web qui est
     en construction et dans le futur livre animé !

Si la somme
espérée n'est pas atteinte, 5% hors frais seront reversés en don à un projet
présenté par indiegogo.
L'impact
Nous avons
établi les partenariats avec le Montpellier Hérault Rugby (MHR) et Montpellier
Handball (MHB). Le projet est venu d'un constat de la réalité locale.
 Je me
suis interrogée: 
 comment
accéder aux places to be ?
 Où
rencontrer les décideurs locaux?  
Comment
répondre aux impératifs du marché ? 
SMB 361
mutualise et permet aussi aux PME d'accéder à des réductions sur les loisirs et
spectacles.  Nous participons à maintenir l'emploi. Les chefs
d'entreprise participent à améliorer l'économie locale et nationale.
J'ai déjà
créé un groupe de business via le BNI expérience riche d'enseignements. Je me
suis rendue compte de l'importance des moments informels et du bouche à
oreille. Sébastien est un ancien sportif de haut niveau, un homme qui sait
réseauter. C'est un compétiteur dans l'âme qui a su rester humble. Il connait
la vie des réseaux et c'est un homme de terrain.
Oui l'idée
de SMB 361 est novatrice, vivante et évolutive. L'investissement pour le membre
n'est pas forcément mesurable immédiatement mais les retombées, pour lui et les
autres membres, ne se feront pas attendre. La synergie fera que le membre
gagnera en attitude et aptitudes afin de qualifier son business. Un travail
d'investissement pour avoir des recommandations à vie et augmenter son chiffre
d'affaires.
Risques et
défis
J'ai fait le
choix de créer une SAS et non une association car je défends l'entrepreneuriat
et il est important pour moi d'être cohérente.
Sébastien et
Thierry sont des chefs d'entreprise également. 
SMB 361 est
une marque de SMB GROUP et deviendra une société à part entière quand elle aura
acquis son autonomie financière. 
Je souhaite
franchiser SMB 361. L'argent est un sujet tabou en France, je crois que
nous pouvons tous améliorer nos vies si nous savons répartir les richesses. 
Je relève
également le défi que nous pouvons créer et développer ailleurs qu'à
Paris. 
J'ai choisi
la ville de Montpellier pour sa situation géographique stratégique et
ses infrastructures. De la même manière nous pouvons innover
différemment des NTIC ou de la santé. Des innovations qui ont fait la notoriété
de Montpellier.

SMB veut dire Solidarity Means Business too !
Ce concept
je l'ai pensé et créé, j'ai la volonté de le mener jusqu'au bout. il n'y a que

<p>Since early 2015 we have been working on the <span style=""color: #0088cc;""><b>SanCloud BeagleBone Enhanced</b></span> board. We have listened to user feedback of what people would like to see on an Enhanced BeagleBone and combined this user wish list with our own requirements and produced the <span style=""color: #0088cc;""><b>SanCloud BeagleBone Enhanced</b></span> platform. We have produced several prototype versions and this has allowed us to iron out hardware and software issues and to fully test the new <span style=""color: #0088cc;""><b>SanCloud BeagleBone Enhanced</b></span> board.

<p><br/></p></div>","SanCloud is enhancing the open source hardware BeagleBone Black design you love with more features than you thought possible! It still has a blistering 1GHz processor and just like the BeagleBone Black, has two 46-pin expansion  headers, micro HDMI for audio/video output, USB ports, Ethernet and other I/O features. The SanCloud BeagleBone Enhanced is an ultra-powered embedded computer that can (still) fit in a mint tin! 




1 Gigabyte DDR3 RAM - twice the amount of the normal BeagleBone Black


Gigabit Ethernet


Extra USB ports, 2 on board plus 2 via expansion header


Optional serial NOR flash for boot loader


Optional 6 axis gyro + accelerometer (we will fit 9 axis '+ compass' if target is reached)


Optional barometer pressure and temperature sensor



Since early 2015 we have been working on the SanCloud BeagleBone Enhanced board. We have listened to user feedback of what people would like to see on an Enhanced BeagleBone and combined this user wish list with our own requirements and produced the SanCloud BeagleBone Enhanced platform. We have produced several prototype versions and this has allowed us to iron out hardware and software issues and to fully test the new SanCloud BeagleBone Enhanced board. As a result, we now have fully functional hardware and software drivers for all the new features and are ready to go.
The SanCloud BeagleBone Enhanced  board is fully supported and licensed by beagleboard.org. This means the same software images from BeagleBone that work on the Black will also work on the SanCloud BeagleBone Enhanced board. It also ensures you can expect the same high quality as you have come to expect from BeagleBone.


What we need now is your support to bring the SanCloud BeagleBone Enhanced to the market. Your support will allow us to start mass production of the board and deliver to you, our Backers.



Our hardware is designed to be flexible and this has allowed us to offer several versions:

SanCloud BeagleBone Enhanced Light

This board offers the same AM3358 1GHz processor from Texas Instruments and like the BeagleBone Black, two 46-pin expansion headers, micro HDMI for audio/video output, 4GByte eMMC flash, micro SD storage card, USB host/device via mini-USB OTG socket. It is fully compatible with BeagleBone Black capes and supported via BeagleBone software releases. This version additionally provides 1GByte of DDR3 800 RAM, ultra fast gigabit Ethernet networking, two on-board USB2.0 type A ports and two further ports via expansion header with the same compact form factor as the older BeagleBone Black.

It is fully compatible with BeagleBone Black capes and supported via BeagleBone software releases. This version additionally provides 1GByte of DDR3 800 RAM, ultra fast gigabit Ethernet networking, two on-board USB2.0 type A ports and two further ports via expansion header. Also provided are 1MByte SPI NOR flash for protected, separate boot loader and room for kernel, additional on board sensors in the form of ST Microelectronics LP331 260-1260mbar Barometer pressure sensor and InvenSense MPU-6050 Six-Axis (Gyro + Accelerometer) and we will fit MPU-9250 Nine-Axis (Gyro + Accelerometer + Compass) if target is reached. As with the ""Light"" version it has the same compact form factor as the older BeagleBone Black.



SanCloud BeagleBone Enhanced Light + WiFi/BT
This has the same features as the SanCloud BeagleBone Enhanced Light version with the addition of a RealTek RTL8723 802.11 b/g/n WiFi and Bluetooth 2.1/4.0 LE module. 




SanCloud BeagleBone Enhanced + WiFi/BT

This has the same features as the SanCloud BeagleBone Enhanced version with the addition of a RealTek RTL8723 802.11 b/g/n WiFi and Bluetooth 2.1/4.0 LE module. 






SanCloud is the only company to offer a fully compatible BeagleBone Black board with many of the additional features requested by you, the fans and users of the BeagleBone Black. As with the current BeagleBone boards the hardware will be fully open sourced with all the design data being released at the same time as when we deliver to Backers.



The extra features of the SanCloud BeagleBone Enhanced board allows for faster networking with gigabit Ethernet and larger applications due to the extra system RAM. Additional USB ports remove the need for external HUB. The twin USB ports also allow for the SanCloud BeagleBone Enhanced board to be used as a single board PC for keyboard and mouse, while the micro HDMI port allows for connection to monitor or TV and internet connection via the RJ45 or the SanCloud WiFi + Bluetooth board.On the fully featured SanCloud BeagleBone Enhanced board the 6 axis gyro + accelerometer ( 9 axis '+ compass' if target is reached) is perfect for robots or autonomous vehicle use. When combined with the barometer, the Enhanced board can be used for quad-copters. The extra sensors are also perfect for educational use.We also added SPI NOR flash along side the current eMMC flash. This was done so that the BeagleBone u-boot boot loader can be kept separate and secure from the system flash. If the user accidentally erases the eMMC there is no problem as the board can still boot u-boot and there is even enough for the kernel to be stored leaving all the eMMC for root file system. On all versions two USB ports are provided on a header next to the cape expansion ports. This can be used with the SanCloud WiFi + Bluetooth plug in board, or for your own projects and even combined with the current cape system for even greater flexibility.



On top of all this the SanCloud BeagleBone Enhanced is still 100% backwards compatible with BeagleBone Black capes and it will work with all future BeagleBone Black Debian software releases, fully supported by beagleboard.org

Our funding target will allow us to fully certify the SanCloud Enhanced board. This will include  and  compliance. The advantage of completing this testing gives greater flexibility and confidence for yourselves of high quality reliable hardware.

If we don't hit our full funding target, the funding you our Backers have given us will still allow us to ship fully functional boards.

<p>I'm a full time
traveler, travel blogger, and social media influencer, having visited 74

<p></p>
<p>I first caught the
travel bug when I studied abroad in <a href=""http://thehungrypartier.com/prague/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Prague</a> during college. That semester opened
my eyes up to the world, as I was able to visit 20+ countries in <a href=""http://thehungrypartier.com/europe-destinations/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Europe</a>, followed by a 4-week backpacking
trip after my program ended. </p>
<p><b>That</b> <b>was the point in my life when I
knew I was never going to stop traveling. </b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454352870/ovb8e7soyt5wsklrptsn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>A few months after I graduated college, I moved to a small village in South Korea to <a href=""http://thehungrypartier.com/teach-english/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">teach English</a> for 18 months. Taking this job was a huge risk, because it was my first time in Asia and I didn't know anything about teaching -- but I saw it as a great opportunity to live and work abroad. <br/></p><p>During my time in
Korea, I became conversational in the Korean Language, visited 20+ Asian
countries, and started my travel blog, <a href=""http://thehungrypartier.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Hungry Partier</a>, from scratch. In my free time, I would
spend 40+ hours a week writing, networking and building up my blog to
what it is today. </p>
<p>My ultimate goal of
starting a travel blog was not only to share my travel experiences, but also to
be an inspiration for others to step outside their comfort zones and see the
world.  Therefore, I strive to respond to every single email, blog
comment, Tweet, Instagram comment, Snapchat message, and any other questions
that come my way.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454353011/lizmrgrv5e8bekk1fkaf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>When I left Korea in
January 2015, I decided pursue my dream of traveling, so I took off to explore
the world with just my 40 liter backpack. I spent the last 12 months
exploring Asia, the Middle East and Europe, while working as a full-time travel

My Name is Drew
Binsky. 
I'm a full time
traveler, travel blogger, and social media influencer, having visited 74
countries since 2012.  
My Background

I first caught the
travel bug when I studied abroad in Prague during college. That semester opened
my eyes up to the world, as I was able to visit 20+ countries in Europe, followed by a 4-week backpacking
trip after my program ended. 
That was the point in my life when I
knew I was never going to stop traveling. 


A few months after I graduated college, I moved to a small village in South Korea to teach English for 18 months. Taking this job was a huge risk, because it was my first time in Asia and I didn't know anything about teaching -- but I saw it as a great opportunity to live and work abroad. During my time in
Korea, I became conversational in the Korean Language, visited 20+ Asian
countries, and started my travel blog, The Hungry Partier, from scratch. In my free time, I would
spend 40+ hours a week writing, networking and building up my blog to
what it is today. 
My ultimate goal of
starting a travel blog was not only to share my travel experiences, but also to
be an inspiration for others to step outside their comfort zones and see the
world.  Therefore, I strive to respond to every single email, blog
comment, Tweet, Instagram comment, Snapchat message, and any other questions
that come my way.  
When I left Korea in
January 2015, I decided pursue my dream of traveling, so I took off to explore
the world with just my 40 liter backpack. I spent the last 12 months
exploring Asia, the Middle East and Europe, while working as a full-time travel
blogger and social media influencer.
Through years of
hard work, I'm proud to say that my blog is thriving, and I have gathered more
than 130K social media followers. I am also honored and excited to be
recently ranked as the #1
Male Travel Blogger in the world by Huffington Post.  (complete media list on my blog)

<p>… well, across a small portion of it. We're three guys from different other portions: Jorge (Madrid, soon Stanford), Leon (Münster) and Nelson (ex Madrid, now Kraków). Through a lengthy and complicated string of coincidences we found ourselves determined to cycle from Paris to Rome. Our tastes and styles of travelling come in slightly different flavours: There's the art, the architecture, the cityscapes, there's the athletic challenge, the curiosity to discover the hidden villages you cannot expect to reach by any other means, there's the desire to find out which place is most terrible.<br/></p>
<p>We're doing a big bad – hopefully awesome – trip and you can be part of it. We're going to write you from and about our travels: Leon – whom nobody told yet loudly enough which century he's supposed to live in – is mostly communicating via letters, somehow he managed to infect Nelson with this habit and so Jorge is likely going to fall prey to them, too. When's the last time you received a letter? A really fancy one, even? Hm, perhaps it's just that you dislike mail. No, not that sort? Well, then we might have something for you …</p>

<i> </i><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>For us, your funding is directly locked to our ease. That doesn't mean we're looking for an easy path! After all, we're going to cross the bloody Alps for no particular practical reason. Like any proper adventure, such a bike trip is the weirdest mix of tremendous fun and existential worries. On the last trip Leon and Nelson had been soaked, frozen, bruised, hungover, hit by a car, despairingly homeless, utterly lost in both cities and primeval wilderness, threatened, bikeless, and surrounded by lightning and thunder. We couldn't have been looking forward any more to the next trip after we had finished that one.<br/>And on top of all that one still has to worry about money. While we don't need a lot, we don't have a lot either. Every single euro or franc is fully appreciated!<br/><br/>We're selling you a piece of our trip, so to say. All of our perks will have you receiving a unique bit of a shareworthy story: A postcard, a letter or more. <br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>Oh dear, we're really crossing the Alps. One of us … insisted. So none of that merry Côte d'Azur exploring, instead: full frontal Switzerland. Lots of it. Wait, which one was that bloody expensive country – not the ones in Scandi— oh. Whoops!<br/><br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>There's always the possibility that we might get run over by a truck, fall off a mountain or even worse: get a bike stolen. Other than that we're ready to endure anything, not even cheating by taking a train or hitch a ride (though we can only resist so much in case we get abducted). We're dead set to survive and arrive, and what qualifies us to hope for the best is Leon and Nelson's last trip: Westphalia to Kraków with lots of detours, 3300 km by bike during which a great lot of all the possible disasters happened and still didn't stop us. You'll get your perks unless not a single one of us three survives.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Spread the word, tell your friends, share our project. Help us get known. Any audience that enjoys our meanders makes us happy!</p>

We believe this is a beneficial project for all societies not only for Liberstad's citizens.

Liberstad will be a city built on the philosophy of anarchism, the non-aggression-principle and private property rights.  We are a small group of voluntaryists who are seeking a change in the way societies are organized. We want to establish the foundations for a new society where people are not subject to a central political power organization that determines how people should live and how the society should develop. We want a society where the people them self can decide the development of the society by respecting natural human rights and moral principles.The ideas behind the Liberstad project comes from a number of renowned economists and philosophers, and is based on anarcho-capitalism, natural law and natural rights, non-aggression principle, spontaneous order, market economy, voluntaryism and the Austrian School of economics.We want to demonstrate that voluntary cooperation and free market economy is a better and more moral alternative to organize a society than central planning of political power organizations.We believe that private actors can deliver both better and more affordable public services without the use of force and coercion, and that politicians and political power is not needed in a society, at least on a local level.We believe that Liberstad will be an exciting and educational project to see how the challenges and issues in a community, both socially and practically can be solved through voluntary and peaceful cooperation.To implement the establishment and start the development of Norway's first private town we need all the help we can get, and we aim to presell 150.000 sqm of land in Liberstad to finance the purchase of the main property where Liberstad will be founded. You can read more about the presale hereThe presales will only bring in enough capital to cover the purchase of the main property and costs, in addition we need capital for rezoning, tools and machinery for the initial development.The property we would like to establish Liberstad on is located on Tjelland in Marnardal Municipality and consists of 1,5 mill sqm of scenic countryside land. We have signed a purchase agreement with the seller and we have established a temporary headquarters on the property. You can read more about the property hereWe have established a company Liberstad Drift AS, which will be responsible for the establishment and initial development of Liberstad. The firm will act as a city-company and will be providing public services to the citizens. Some of Liberstad Drift's tasks will be to establish road networks and their maintenance, parks, playgrounds, water and sewer systems, security services, garbage collection and much more.Liberstad is an ambitious project but we are determined to establish Norway's first private town no matter what obstacles and challenges we might face. We believe this is a beneficial project for all societies not only for Liberstad's citizens. It can eventually show other towns and communities that political power is not needed to solve social and societal challenges.All work related to the project is based on voluntary and unpaid work and we expect it will take 3-4 years before the company has enough income and we can withdraw money for our work. Until then, the development is based on voluntary work, savings from the founders and donations. We are deeply grateful for all contributions and support we can get to develop this project and all contributions will go directly to the establishment and development of Liberstad. ABOUT USMy name is John Holmesland and I've been working in construction and real estate development on a small scale for 20 years. I study Austrian economics and philosophy and I've been a Voluntaryist for the past 8 years . I have now dedicated my life to work for peace and liberty and I want to establish the foundation for a new society that adheres to the natural rights and the moral principles of Voluntaryism.I want to use my expertise and knowledge from my previous work to make a more civilized society for both my self and my family and others to live, work and prosper in.My co-partner on this project Sondre Bjellås is also a Volyntaryist and works as an IT- consultant and has more than 15 years of experience with IT-network and security systems. Sondre is a co-editor for the Norwegian Mises institute and has been writing about Austrian economics, voluntaryism and anarcho-capitalism for several years.  WHY?We want to make an impact on the way society is organized through coercion and aggression from political power organizations.

<p>“Abundance is not something we acquire; it is something we tune in to.” (Wayne Dyer)</p>
<p>“Bicycles are everywhere. Why settle for just one?” (Cherry St Bikes)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Imagine a place where you can borrow a bike for yourself and a friend, or even your entire family, pick up a few healthy snacks, tune-up your own bike, or even design and build a custom bike to take home. </p>
<p>Hi, my name is Marco Carmona, I’m one of the founders of Cherry St. Bicycle Co-op. Our mission is to make bikes (and trikes, and surreys, oh my!) accessible for everyone in our immediate community and beyond. Our idea for Cherry St. Bikes began when neighborhood children were using my front yard as a bicycle repair station. We realized they had no idea how to maintain their bikes and there were few local options for our under-served community to repair, purchase, or borrow a bike. Many of their parents weren’t riding with them because they didn’t own an adult bike. For months, we surveyed the community- some folks didn’t have a place to store a bike, others simply didn’t want to ride alone. But bikes are everywhere- and everyone wants to ride a bike- how could we turn plenty of predicaments into a bounty of bike-riding beauties? (Well, we think our neighbors are beautiful!) Eureka! A co-operative providing a library lending system of bikes of all shapes and sizes, along with a repair shop, shone like the sun that rises on the East Side. We soon secured a commercial location within our downtown neighborhood for our clubhouse at 132 Cherry St. and Cherry Street Bicycle Co-op was suddenly more than just an idea! Cherry Street Bikes will soon provide an option for anyone who desires to ride, from parents with children, granny with her bad knees, regular Joes, and even bike-riding beauties with special needs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your help and contributions will make it possible for us to open our San Antonio downtown clubhouse to the public allowing us to share two wheel bikes, trikes, tandems, large multi-passenger bikes (surrey) and special needs bikes. We’ll also house a commercial kitchen that will be available for special events and will provide healthy snacks and picnics for your bike-riding adventures! Our downtown location affords you access to all of the cool spots and landmarks that make San Antonio a wonderful place to explore.  </p>
<p>Cherry St. Bikes strives to provide neighborhoods with a sense of community. We are proud when we see our neighbors outside, riding together as a family, and we can’t wait to see you on a Cherry Street Bike! A growing member base will allow us to grow our bicycle fleet and eventually expand our co-operative to other neighborhoods and cities. Join us today by investing in a membership. </p>

Risks & Challenges
Every business has risks and challenges I have had many to overcome from Social Services, Eviction, but I have done what I have had to do because I know a lot of people in the area value our service and all these problems have been overcome now.

Another main risk is that outlets have no faith in our system being a new company but with the funding we can install equipment into outlets on a trial period and prove our system works before the outlets commit to using our service.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Objects lose their massive material body and turn into contours, imaginatively reminiscent of their purpose. Modern technologies allow placing electronics inside the product housing in such a way as needed to turn it into a logically and conceptually sound frame-like symbol. I’ve been using frame technologies in concept designs and my own products for more than 10 years. In 2000 I first published the “Q-time” wristwatch concept, which later was used as a prop in the A. Zeldovich movie “Mischen” (“The Target”). 2009 saw the introduction of the “Sputnik watch” concept. And the White and White Clock started off in 2009 as an ambitious-concept Black and White Clock using individual OLED components, and a production-ready model in a white case was released to the public in 2011. The White &amp; White Clock has drawn a lot of attention from fellow designers and the general public.

In the process of making the Only Clock, award-winning designer Vadim Kibardin was focused on the essential aspects, not burdening his object with redundancy. Back to purity, back to simplicity.The designer uses this philosophy to create an eye-catching and functional piece of art. Whether on a desk or on a wall, the Only Clock is certain to turn heads.MEDIA TESTIMONIALS  “The clock has a futuristic design that is minimalist while presenting the functionality of a timepiece in a new and enticing manner.”  The Trend Hunter“The ONLY CLOCK rids your day of the unnecessary and strips away the non-essentials to give you a pure and simple view of the time.”  The GadgetFlow“In fact, it’s so minimal that it doesn’t even need a center or face! The result is an eye-catching, functional piece of art!”  Yanko Design“If you’ve been finding that analog ticker on your living room wall a little too plain for your urbane digs, this thing should make for quite the modern replacement.”  CoolthingsFEATURED IN FOR MORE THAN 5 YEARS, KIBARDIN HAS BEEN HELPING YOU TO CONTROL YOUR TIME AND ENJOY YOUR LIFEKibardin’s clocks and watches are always a unique and innovative way of displaying time. KIBARDIN’s awesome timepieces are the perfect solution, whether you want to use your clock as an eye-catching detail in any interior, or just to display something revolutionary with perfect balance in design and function. We prefer simple shapes, and use materials that are best suited for this purpose. We are proud to present our latest styles of classic contemporary KIBARDIN timepieces.From a delicate, porcelain tea cup, to an innovative LED wall clock, Kibardin's imaginative creations continue to spearhead innovative and exceptional design. The Only Clock from Vadim Kibardin is a new exercise in aesthetic reductionism. Consider one of these inspiring clock dial designs if you want to make reading the time easier and quicker.We always work hard to meet your wishes, and use your feedback for new product designs.YOU CAN BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR SUCCESS Take part and bring the Only Clock to mass production using the best manufacturing tools, help us develop our plans, and ignite the imagination for bringing to market new futuristic design.JUST TIME, NOTHING ELSE  The new KIBARDIN ONLY CLOCK is a Digital wall/desk LED clock with a hollow round face. The frame of the Only Clock displays the hour digits and minute points, crafted in a white or black ABS plastic body.Be in real time. The biggest innovation of the Only Clock is that it replicates analog clock mechanisms with digital resources, showing time in completely new way. Each LED in the external circle indicates one minute and lights up for 60 seconds. So naturally, there are 60 LEDs in the internal circle just like there are 60 full minutes in 1 hour, and when the last one lights up, it indicates the actual time period between 7:59 am and 8:00 am. In our video we marked the last LED with 7:60 am.Day or Night, you will always see the time. Our Clock shows only one minute point and hour digit in an optimal contrast mode. This means that throughout your dark time, our clock will maintain its day light status, however, you will not be woken up or kept awake by a bright light during the night.The Only Clock has an alarm function. This alarm is for those who have trouble waking up in the morning. It literally yanks you out of bed, as you need to wake up and go to the clock in order to turn off the alarm.Right Angled 90 Degree Jack  The small DC port found on our Only Clock reverse side is a power socket for a 3.5mm Jack. Our Right Angled 90 Degree Jack lets you use the clock on horizontal and vertical surfaces.Although cables which have a 3.5mm Jack plug at one end and a standard USB A plug on the other may seem simple and largely indistinguishable from one another, there are differences that make certain cables better than others. Our cable is 5 meters in length and has all the internal qualities that a good cable should have, including tightly-braided wires inside a spiral foil shield. The braided wires help prevent electromagnetic interference and provide structural support, while the foil shield reduces interference.Install the clock on your wall with the removable hanger.The mounting hardware is located at the back of the wall clock. The Only Clock construction is created with a place for a special hanger. It has a big keyhole to help find the screw or nail, making hanging the clock easier and keeping it steady and flat.Install the cords behind your walls. The standard set contains an AC adapter with a five meter cord. Installing the clock’s cords behind your walls is a great way to extend your home or office without cluttering your floors with a tangle of cables.Power adapters are essential equipment no matter what country you live in. Our clock is equipped with one AC adapter with interchangeable plugs for the US, UK, EU, and Korea, covering the whole world.Maintain the time.The clock only works with mains electricity, however, a battery should be installed to maintain the time in case of mains power outages.Special rates on DHL delivery.United in Success – Every Day. Every Parcel. Both KIBARDIN and DHL understand what it means to start small and grow into a worldwide institution, achieving success through a passion for excellence, innovation and teamwork. We are proud to have DHL as our Official Logistics Partner.When it comes to design, simplicity is often the best policy. The Only Clock was designed by award-winning designer Vadim Kibardin as a modern 3D interpretation of a traditional analog wall clock.The material world becomes more complex on the inside and streamlined on the outside. Objects lose their massive material body and turn into contours, imaginatively reminiscent of their purpose. Modern technologies allow placing electronics inside the product housing in such a way as needed to turn it into a logically and conceptually sound frame-like symbol. I’ve been using frame technologies in concept designs and my own products for more than 10 years. In 2000 I first published the “Q-time” wristwatch concept, which later was used as a prop in the A. Zeldovich movie “Mischen” (“The Target”). 2009 saw the introduction of the “Sputnik watch” concept. And the White and White Clock started off in 2009 as an ambitious-concept Black and White Clock using individual OLED components, and a production-ready model in a white case was released to the public in 2011. The White & White Clock has drawn a lot of attention from fellow designers and the general public. The Only Clock is the next step in the evolution of time devices and is based on my research in the field of «framework technologies».Completely silent and precise – the world’s first mass produced frame clock. An expressive image and charismatic character make this clock recognizable and turn it into the highlight of any interior, while its non-compromising quality ensures many years of reliable service. Treat yourself or your loved ones to a gift of time and memories.The size of the clock is tailored to medium-sized interiors. The clock measures 300mm in the outer diameter, which ensures comfortable time reading from up to 8 meters. A clock this size can be placed on the shelf or on the wall, in groups or alone, in residential as well as office spaces. The room’s interior can be any style, since the clock does not feature any prominent massive housing or a traditional clock face. The clock literally ‘passes’ the environment through itself, dissolves it, and at the same time fulfills its function and projects the symbolic image of eternally flowing time. Round and round, day after day, not skipping one second.This is the clean style of the clock’s housing - there’s nothing superfluous, nothing redundant, the surfaces gently curve and flow around the internal components, while providing the clock with stable footing for placement on horizontal surfaces. A wall mount is provided, allowing you to reliably attach the clock parallel to the wall axis.The 90° rotatable DC jack allows for consistently convenient and reliable plug insertion in both horizontal and vertical positions. Note though, that a clock with this amount of white LEDs cannot be powered by batteries. Using the adapter and the separate 5-meter power cord you can display the clock in a place of your choosing, and power it from the nearest outlet.Two control buttons are positioned inside the window, not visible at first glance, but always accessible from the front. These provide a convenient way of interfacing with the clock. You won’t experience any difficulty setting the time or managing your alarm.Located next to the control buttons are the sound holes for the alarm. The only thing you’ll need to do is turn off this loud ringing - as fast as possible!The clock is encased in a matte black-and-white housing with matte light-grey and dark-grey light-dispersing screens. The digits show the current hour. The current minute is shown by the glowing segment on the minute circle. The Only Clock allows you to see the precise time in a familiar, intuitive manner, the same way it is seen on common analog clocks with hands. This method is familiar to everybody - nothing is easier, there are no puzzles of any kind. The white LED color is not incidental – it blends harmoniously with overall black and white color scheme. Due to the contrasting colors you can easily read the precise time in any lightning conditions, but it won’t bother you during the nighttime or impede falling asleep.The box contains the clock, a detachable 5-meter power cord with USB connector for mains connection on one side and a DC jack for clock connection on the other, a universal power adapter supporting all mains types, and a special plug matching the power outlets in the region of intended usage. There’s a choice of UK, SAA, EU, and US plugs for use in United States, Canada, Europe, Middle East, South America, Asia, The Caribbean, Great Britain, Ireland, Africa, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, Fiji, New Zealand, China, Japan, France, and more than 150 countries. Also included are the instructions, the 2 year warranty card, and a troubleshooting manual to help you find the solution to any non-standard situation and restore the clock to its normal functioning mode. Everything is packaged inside a gift box with soft padding that reliably holds all contents inside the box and protects them from any potential damage.The clock only works with mains electricity!Specification

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<div></div>
<p>In Summer 2016, our organization has the opportunity to be a part of the largest traveling music festival, Vans Warped Tour. This festival contains our primary target demographic (Ages 13-19) and primary stakeholders (Musicians and Bands of diverse genres). We will become a vendor, travel nationally and internationally, and spread our mission and the importance of volunteerism. Additionally, we will host and organize community outreaches for teens and musicians during the tour.</p>
<p>Vans Warped Tour dates are: mid June-August 2016 Throughout the course of these dates, we will have the opportunity to spread our message to over 500,000 attendees and volunteer in more than 40 cities!</p>

<p>Skully Serves is dedicated to promoting volunteerism and encouraging teenagers and young adults to become actively involved in their community.</p>
<p>We provide engaging, informative, and meaningful outreach opportunities. Through local outreaches and service learning, we connect teens with their favorite musical artists by volunteering, service learning, and working together.</p>
<p>Since April 2015, we have had monthly community outreaches that promote volunteerism, inclusiveness, and community involvement in the Los Angeles area and will be spearheading our first Richmond, VA outreach in December 2015. We will be organizing monthly outreaches in both areas and are quickly expanding to the Pacific Northwest region. Our outreaches have benefited a variety of significant causes, such as: environmental clean-up, helping children with disabilities during their swim sessions, assembling care packages for the military, caring for rescued animals, and much more. </p>

<p>
</p>
<p>With raised funds, we will be able to reach teens across the nation and more importantly be able to promote our cause and serve others together. The benefits of volunteering are countless and life-changing. By donating to our cause, you are not only supporting our mission, but also helping us to demonstrate social responsibility, positivity, and a passion for helping others.</p>
<div><br/></div>Moreover, we want to show teens that volunteering is enjoyable and more so important for our well-being. Our wish is that the music scene will embrace this movement and that artists will do their part by helping to raise awareness as well as volunteering in the community outreaches.<div><br/></div>
<div>We want the work of Skully Serves to strike an active chord within our young people. Rather than passively sympathize with a problem or cause, teenagers will find a solution and take action. We want to instill the importance of volunteerism into the forefront of teenagers' minds where they feel absolutely compelled, responsible, and eager to maintain an active role in their community.</div>

</div></div>","Who We Are

In Summer 2016, our organization has the opportunity to be a part of the largest traveling music festival, Vans Warped Tour. This festival contains our primary target demographic (Ages 13-19) and primary stakeholders (Musicians and Bands of diverse genres). We will become a vendor, travel nationally and internationally, and spread our mission and the importance of volunteerism. Additionally, we will host and organize community outreaches for teens and musicians during the tour.
Vans Warped Tour dates are: mid June-August 2016 Throughout the course of these dates, we will have the opportunity to spread our message to over 500,000 attendees and volunteer in more than 40 cities!




Skully Serves is dedicated to promoting volunteerism and encouraging teenagers and young adults to become actively involved in their community.
We provide engaging, informative, and meaningful outreach opportunities. Through local outreaches and service learning, we connect teens with their favorite musical artists by volunteering, service learning, and working together.
Since April 2015, we have had monthly community outreaches that promote volunteerism, inclusiveness, and community involvement in the Los Angeles area and will be spearheading our first Richmond, VA outreach in December 2015. We will be organizing monthly outreaches in both areas and are quickly expanding to the Pacific Northwest region. Our outreaches have benefited a variety of significant causes, such as: environmental clean-up, helping children with disabilities during their swim sessions, assembling care packages for the military, caring for rescued animals, and much more. 




Skully Serves: What We Need 
 
To complete this effort, we are in need of $15,000 to travel the entire duration of Vans Warped Tour 2016. This covers all travel expenses for the organization, premium social media promotion, catering, and secures our booth spot for the entire duration of Vans Warped Tour 2016.

    The Impact 


With raised funds, we will be able to reach teens across the nation and more importantly be able to promote our cause and serve others together. The benefits of volunteering are countless and life-changing. By donating to our cause, you are not only supporting our mission, but also helping us to demonstrate social responsibility, positivity, and a passion for helping others.
Moreover, we want to show teens that volunteering is enjoyable and more so important for our well-being. Our wish is that the music scene will embrace this movement and that artists will do their part by helping to raise awareness as well as volunteering in the community outreaches.
We want the work of Skully Serves to strike an active chord within our young people. Rather than passively sympathize with a problem or cause, teenagers will find a solution and take action. We want to instill the importance of volunteerism into the forefront of teenagers' minds where they feel absolutely compelled, responsible, and eager to maintain an active role in their community.

<p>Hello everyone.

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Why a Mobile Business?</h3>
<div>Now, I know what you're thinking. A mobile business? Why would I do that? Wouldn't a normal brick and mortar business be better? Lets face it. Rent on a building in a decent neighborhood is over $1,000 a month and that doesn't include utilities or insurance.

<div>By having a mobile business, I have more areas that I can open up shop. I won't be tied down to one specific area. My overhead will be low since I will essentially own my building.

<div>Hello, and welcome to Knights European Bakery. My name is Jim Card, and after 20 years of baking experience, bread has become a passion of mine, It is also a staple in many people's lives.</div>
<div>Knights want's to bring a European style of bread making to Spokane, WA. With it's many different types of breads, I believe it is a truly unique way of baking. Making breads with different types of flours such as Rye, Spelt, and others that are popular in Europe will give us a variety that you cannot find any where else. With the stone deck oven that we will have, Knights will be able to produce our breads with a thick crispy crust and a soft dense center.</div>
<div>Knights will bring the tastes and smells of this style of homemade European breads to the people of the Spokane area. By doing so, we will be fulfilling one of our main goals as a bakery, which is to help people find and taste these great European breads and baked goods.</div>
<div>The people that contribute to this campaign will be helping to bring European breads to Spokane, and my dream of owning a great bakery.      </div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>The purpose of our campaign is to raise the cash injection for our portion of the money needed to start the bakery. The banks require 20% of the money to come from the owner. To reach this, we need to raise $10,000. dollars. </div>
<div>The money raised will be used to start the lease on the building and the remodeling process. </div>
<div>* $1700 to start lease</div>
<div>* $2000 for remodel plans and permits.</div>
<div>* The rest will go for the start of the remodel.</div>
<div>We have some very fun and delicious perks. At each level of donation, you will receive something in return for your very generous contribution. Every thing from free breads and donuts, to classes that you can take to learn how to make baked goods, as well as take some home with you when the class is over. These offerings are just the beginning...</div>
<div>If, by chance, we do not make our goal, the funds will still be used to start the bakery, but on a smaller scale. The hope is that we make it and are able to provide Spokane and the region with a great European bakery.  </div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>With this bakery, Knights will be able to bring great food to the people. Baking is an art. This way of baking is something that has been around for generations. To have a passion for baking, you need to love to work with your hands and enjoy the feel of making something that has been passed down from generations of ancestors. These people were the real innovators of their time. They forged a path to what we do today. I find it a joy to keep up the proud tradition of baking by bringing the people of the community that I live and work in the happiness of having fresh and locally made baked goods.</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""> To make the breads that people really want, the types that they are looking for, with thick crisp crust and the soft dense crumb, this is what makes the passion come out. Being able to make pastries and other baked goods with your hands and putting in the details that bring out the beauty and flavors of the things that I bake is what it is all about. With all of this going into our baking, I hope to make our customers' lives happier and more satisfied. All of this is what leads me to wanting to own and run my own bakery.</span></div>
<div>There will be a difference between our breads and our competitors. The breads that we make will be of European style. Our dough's will be made from fresh, whole grain ingredients. The dough's will go through a long, natural fermentation process. This will give them a full bodied flavor. The process of a long fermentation lets the dough mature and the gluten develop, which brings out the flavors and texture of the bread. From there we will then form the dough's into their final shapes and give them a full proof. Knights' breads will then be baked in our stone deck oven. This is the type of oven that the bakers of Europe use to produce authentic European breads. </div>

<div>There will be risks. As with any new business, there is the break in period of the first year or two. Getting everything to flow smoothly and properly can take some time. Having a strong team of people behind you helps to relieve some of the stress and tensions that come from running your on business.</div>
</div><div>Having experience in the field helps as well. I have been a baker for 20 years. Within that time, I was a bakery manager for a supermarket chain for 17 years. I am well qualified as a baker and have the knowledge to run a bakery. Using the skills that I have learned while doing that job will come in handy everyday to overcome the challenges and hurdles at the bakery.</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<div>Some of you may not be able to help with a monetary donation, but you can still help our campaign. Getting the word out to all your friends and family and making a lot of noise about our campaign will be a big help in itself. You can do this by using the Indiegogo share tools to get the word out. </div>
<div>I would like to say a very big THANK YOU to all of you for your time and devotion to help us achieve our dream. Thank you, from Jim and the family we call Knights European Bakery!</div>

<p><b>Hello
Indiegogo!</b></p>
<p>Are you a lover of beautiful crystals but wish you
had access to bigger pieces? Did your childhood rock hobby turn into a mineral
menagerie that you proudly display and want to expand? Does your business carry
a selection of crystals, minerals, and stones but you can’t find the diversity or
deals you want?</p>
<p>If your answer is yes to any of these questions, the
solution is simple; travel the world to the largest rock, gem, and mineral
shows where the selection is laid out before you.<span>  <b>Or
even better, let us do the legwork for you.</b></span></p>
<p><span><b></b></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458621058/ms9i5ymrsry6vk0a0gdp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p>While at the Tucson Gem, Mineral, and Fossil show again, Erica Ziegman had an idea. How could she share the shows of the world
with all those people and businesses that aren’t able to drop everything and
attend them? Drawing on her 10+ years of experience working with numerous retailers
of crystals and minerals, she began to develop the Erathan Emptor concept.
After much refinement, we present the business to you and hope together we can
launch this revolutionary new way to shop.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458627267/kxu4cuj4orhedmgz3omg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p><b>How it works</b></p>
<p>Throughout the year, Erathan Emptor will attend <b>AT LEAST</b> the four world renown gem and
mineral shows where she will work with some of the largest miners and vendors
to bring you the most awesome pieces at the rockingest prices available.
Bringing their products to you <b>LIVE</b>
through our custom built website, you will be able to see the show as it
unfolds. Erica will post photographs of available products in real time on the
website where they will be exhibited for 30 minutes. Anyone registered at
Ambassador Level (see website for details) will be able to purchase these
amazing specimens from anywhere using their own device (smartphone, laptop,
etc.). </p>
<p>Now this isn’t your typical auction site or
internet store; if you see a piece you want you’ll need to hit that <b>‘Buy Now’</b> button because you’ll not
only be competing with the timer and other buyers on site but this is <b>LIVE</b>- so with the people at the show as
well. When you do hit that button, you will know exactly what you are spending
as the listed price will include shipping to the address you’ve filed into your
profile and saved in our system. In most cases, these new treasures will arrive
at your home or business in just a few days because they will be shipped from
the show within 24 hours of purchase. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458621175/xce52puwcy7dst6sm5k6.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>The process is the same for our business partners.
Registered businesses that have confirmed their wholesale status will be able
to purchase the same products the same way. Wholesalers will receive a specified
discount off the list price and the products will be winging their way to your
store within the day!</p>
<p><b>Why Indiegogo</b></p>
<p>To launch a business like this takes a lot of hard
work and a fair bit of cash. We’re happy to put in the work because we truly
feel this model will take off and let us bring some incredible pieces to great
people world-wide, but the cash has presented us with a stumbling block. We
chose to use crowd funding to finance the project for one main reason; cost. By
avoiding traditional financing, we don’t incur the interest charges that would
have to be passed on to our customers. It has been important from the beginning
that we keep costs as low as possible not only for our retail customer but for
the retailers that are using us as their connection to the shows.</p>

<p><b>What we need
….. and WHAT YOU GET</b></p>
<p>This is a completely new concept and there are a
few moving parts that have to be in place to make this work. We know this list
is pretty daunting and while we would love to have a rich benefactor cover it
all for us, we know that’s probably not going to happen. </p>

</div><br/></div>","Hello
Indiegogo!
Are you a lover of beautiful crystals but wish you
had access to bigger pieces? Did your childhood rock hobby turn into a mineral
menagerie that you proudly display and want to expand? Does your business carry
a selection of crystals, minerals, and stones but you can’t find the diversity or
deals you want?
If your answer is yes to any of these questions, the
solution is simple; travel the world to the largest rock, gem, and mineral
shows where the selection is laid out before you.  Or
even better, let us do the legwork for you.



While at the Tucson Gem, Mineral, and Fossil show again, Erica Ziegman had an idea. How could she share the shows of the world
with all those people and businesses that aren’t able to drop everything and
attend them? Drawing on her 10+ years of experience working with numerous retailers
of crystals and minerals, she began to develop the Erathan Emptor concept.
After much refinement, we present the business to you and hope together we can
launch this revolutionary new way to shop.





How it works
Throughout the year, Erathan Emptor will attend AT LEAST the four world renown gem and
mineral shows where she will work with some of the largest miners and vendors
to bring you the most awesome pieces at the rockingest prices available.
Bringing their products to you LIVE
through our custom built website, you will be able to see the show as it
unfolds. Erica will post photographs of available products in real time on the
website where they will be exhibited for 30 minutes. Anyone registered at
Ambassador Level (see website for details) will be able to purchase these
amazing specimens from anywhere using their own device (smartphone, laptop,
etc.). 
Now this isn’t your typical auction site or
internet store; if you see a piece you want you’ll need to hit that ‘Buy Now’ button because you’ll not
only be competing with the timer and other buyers on site but this is LIVE- so with the people at the show as
well. When you do hit that button, you will know exactly what you are spending
as the listed price will include shipping to the address you’ve filed into your
profile and saved in our system. In most cases, these new treasures will arrive
at your home or business in just a few days because they will be shipped from
the show within 24 hours of purchase. 



The process is the same for our business partners.
Registered businesses that have confirmed their wholesale status will be able
to purchase the same products the same way. Wholesalers will receive a specified
discount off the list price and the products will be winging their way to your
store within the day!
Why Indiegogo
To launch a business like this takes a lot of hard
work and a fair bit of cash. We’re happy to put in the work because we truly
feel this model will take off and let us bring some incredible pieces to great
people world-wide, but the cash has presented us with a stumbling block. We
chose to use crowd funding to finance the project for one main reason; cost. By
avoiding traditional financing, we don’t incur the interest charges that would
have to be passed on to our customers. It has been important from the beginning
that we keep costs as low as possible not only for our retail customer but for
the retailers that are using us as their connection to the shows.


What we need
….. and WHAT YOU GET
This is a completely new concept and there are a
few moving parts that have to be in place to make this work. We know this list
is pretty daunting and while we would love to have a rich benefactor cover it
all for us, we know that’s probably not going to happen. 
·  Custom designed website
·  Quality Camera Equipment
·  Laptop with High-speed internet connectivity 
·  Travel funds
·  Funds to purchase the products
So we’ve come
here and we brought perks! 

Please enjoy the Perks on the right of the screen
and help us shower you in crystal joy while building our business.
And Remember……

I have built over 300 of the things and made over 2000 launches in the last 25 years including being asked to launch rocket-powered toilets for TV shows and 40ft tall replica missiles for live PR events.</p><p>In the year 2000 my friends and I set a new European amateur rocket altitude record of over 34,000ft with a rocket we designed and built ourselves. Last year, that record was broken by a team from the Netherlands who sent a rocket to 70,000ft, over 21km in altitude.</p><p>I want to undertake a new record-breaking rocket project and get as many new people interested and involved in rocketry and space science as possible in the process.</p><p><b><i>I want our record back for the UK... my local brewery are going to help, and YOU can too.</i></b></p><p><b><i><br/></i></b></p><p><b>Here's our current funding progress (updated daily) showing the key goals along the way!:</b></p><p><b></b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463388488/funding-thermometer-16-05_nsxkvi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><h3 style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Plan.</h3><p><i><b>All of the greatest British inventions and schemes throughout history have been hatched in a pub or at least over a good beer. Rockets are no exception...</b></i></p><p>Ever since I was about 18 I had this idea of combining beer and rockets and making an attempt to launch a can of beer into space...or at least pretty close to it. You may ask why, I would reply... <i>""Why not?""</i>, as the great land speed record hero Richard Noble once said... <i>""For Britain and the hell of it"". </i>As I am older, wiser and fatter than I was in 2000 and about to hit the big 'four-o' this summer I figured it was now time to make it actually happen.</p><p>In all seriousness, it's about the ultimate democratisation of space flight... what brings people together like an idea shared over a few cold beers? The superficially silly idea of using something as esoteric as a space rocket to fly some beer out of the atmosphere is actually the best way to show that space is for all of us, if we can plan and execute a near-space rocket launch from our local pub, anyone can be part of the private space-race.</p><p>Our plan is to raise enough funding to build and then launch a new record-breaking rocket later this year, one capable of flying over 30km high, leaving almost all of the Earth's atmosphere behind and doing so with a small payload of beer on board.</p><p>This crowd-funding campaign is being run simultaneously with the brewing of a limited edition beer called 'Hop Rocket IPA' by the awesome team at Redwell Brewery in Norwich... the first beer brewed using hops which have been launched on a rocket!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462620236/hoprocket-montage01_dqejh5.jpg"" src="""" style=""background-color: initial;""/><br/></p><p></p><p><b>You will be able to follow our progress on the rocket and during the launch itself on our facebook page here: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/hoprocketrecord/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/hoprocketrecord/</a></b></p><p><b>Or on our website/blog here: <a href=""http://www.hoprocketrecord.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.hoprocketrecord.com</a></b></p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>The Perks.</h3><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Whether you're a space-geek or a beer-geek, backing this project gets you some cool things...

Most of all... you get the satisfaction of knowing that you have helped achieve something pretty awesome and brought a record back to the UK.</span><br/></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b><i> We cannot offer alcohol as a perk for the project, as such what you will get instead is a ticket to attend an exclusive event for the project at which the Hop Rocket IPA beer will be available OR redeemable against an online purchase from Eebria.</i></span></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><i>It should also be noted that perks such as items flown on board the altitude record etc are dependent on A: the rocket being launched and B: the rocket being safely recovered.

We designed and built a rocket in just 10 weeks to try and set a new altitude record at over 50,000ft (the highest we had flown before this was just 15,000ft). We flew the rocket out in a wooden crate to San Francisco and then drove in a rented RV across the western US to the desolate Black Rock desert. We camped in that RV for four days and, with the help of some awesome characters and a few late nights powered by energy drinks shared from urine-sample bottles (rocket scientists use whatever is to hand to solve a problem) we launched our rocket and achieved a new record.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462621050/peav-montage01_jpn9mt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>We set the altitude record at over 34,000ft (10km) with a rocket that defies the normal rules and takes a more 'extreme' approach to going high. The rocket, called 'Phobos EAV' was a boosted dart design. Conceived by NASA as a way to launch very small payloads cheaply to the very edge of the atmosphere a 'boosted dart' does exactly what it's name suggests...</p><p>It's all about drag and momentum. By using a very high-thrust rocket engine a boosted dart accelerates rapidly to an extreme velocity and then releases a thin, heavy 'dart' that sits atop the rocket motor, imparting most of it's kinetic energy into something with VERY low drag. This tiny dart then 'coasts' up through the atmosphere as it gently decelerates, eventually turning around and falling back to Earth (hopefully intact).<br/></p><p>This design has the advantage of being able to send the dart section to a much higher altitude than a conventional rocket with the same amount of power could reach, but with the dissadvantage of A: being very small so not being able to carry much on it's journey, and B: everything on board the rocket needing to withstand massive acceleration at launch,</p><p>The Phobos EAV rocket was an imperfect design. The 'dart' stayed stuck on top of the rocket for several seconds after it should have broken free due to an error in the design of the attachment joint. We have learnt what we did wrong and are ready to try again... only this time, we are going for broke.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462621936/rocket-diagrams_copy-sml_yebabl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The new rocket has 35% more fuel than Phobos EAV and delivers over 3 times as much thrust. This new rocket will accelerate the dart to over 2000mph (nearly 3 times the speed of sound) in just over 1 second before releasing it. </p><p>The smaller, more streamlined dart should then 'coast' for around a minute, reaching a peak altitude of over 100,000ft (30km) before beginning it's descent back to Earth, hopefully slowed down by a Kevlar 'para-streamer' which will be ejected from the dart using a small explosive charge.</p><p>We hope to carry not only electronic altimeters and GPS systems on the dart to record how high it has gone but also at least one miniature camera, built to withstand this extreme flight and hopefully bring us back video from the edge of space.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>The Beer.</h3><p>This whole project is being conducted with the help of Redwell Brewery who's rocket-themed branding on their craft beers caught my eye in a local shop and who offered to help promote the campaign. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">To kick off the project and provide a tangible reward to be enjoyed by those who help with the project, Redwell asked me to help them create a unique one-off beer. </span></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462785747/hoprocket-brewery-team-captioned_v2lf1i.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>On Saturday 30th April this year a big red rocket lifted off from the East Anglian countryside carrying 5kg of hops in it's payload bay. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">This rocket wasn't ever intended to set any altitude records but was just designed to carry it's precious organic cargo to around half a mile in altitude on a fiery joy-ride.</span></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462622567/hoprocket-onboard01_gnbmnk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The hops were recovered safely after the rocket parachuted back to the ground and were taken back to the brewery to begin the brewing process.

<p>Launching rockets isn't cheap. It's cheaper than you might think, but it still costs money. We have turned to crowd-funding to raise the money for this project because we believe this is a genuinely cool project that not only brings a high-tech community science project to Norfolk and the glory of a record back to the UK but also inspires people to get involved in space science in a way that perhaps they never realised they could. Did you know, wherever you are in the UK there is probably an amateur rocketry club within a couple of hours of you that could help you build and launch your own rocket? Probably not, but it's true!</p>
<p>The funding we are asking for in this campaign will be spent on building the rocket itself (a task of small-scale but precision engineering), the electronic systems to go on board the dart (which will all need to be custom made and/or modified to withstand the flight), the fuel to power the rocket and, critically, the costs of getting the rocket and the small crew needed to launch it out to the only place remote enough to be able to safely launch something this extreme... the Black Rock desert in Nevada, site of Britain's past world land speed record glory and proven experimental rocket launching location.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>Other ways to help</h3><p>In addition to just donating to this campaign, it would be GREAT if you can share this campaign far and wide, encourage your friends and family to support us too. <br/>If you run (or know someone who runs) a relevant business in Norfolk or Suffolk and think you can help by donating goods or services to the project then that would be great as it allows us to allocate more of the funds raised to the other aspects of the project. Specific things we need help with include:<br/></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Miniature digital cameras/action cameras</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Precision metalworking - Turning of steel parts</span><br/>

</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Logistics/travel for valuable/delicate goods and people to/from the western USA.</span></li>

I am Ben Jarvis, a dad, a husband, a regular guy from the east of England... with a somewhat extreme passion....Since I was about 15 years old I have been obsessed with rockets. I have built over 300 of the things and made over 2000 launches in the last 25 years including being asked to launch rocket-powered toilets for TV shows and 40ft tall replica missiles for live PR events.In the year 2000 my friends and I set a new European amateur rocket altitude record of over 34,000ft with a rocket we designed and built ourselves. Last year, that record was broken by a team from the Netherlands who sent a rocket to 70,000ft, over 21km in altitude.I want to undertake a new record-breaking rocket project and get as many new people interested and involved in rocketry and space science as possible in the process.I want our record back for the UK... my local brewery are going to help, and YOU can too.Here's our current funding progress (updated daily) showing the key goals along the way!:The Plan.All of the greatest British inventions and schemes throughout history have been hatched in a pub or at least over a good beer. Rockets are no exception...Ever since I was about 18 I had this idea of combining beer and rockets and making an attempt to launch a can of beer into space...or at least pretty close to it. You may ask why, I would reply... ""Why not?"", as the great land speed record hero Richard Noble once said... ""For Britain and the hell of it"". As I am older, wiser and fatter than I was in 2000 and about to hit the big 'four-o' this summer I figured it was now time to make it actually happen.In all seriousness, it's about the ultimate democratisation of space flight... what brings people together like an idea shared over a few cold beers? The superficially silly idea of using something as esoteric as a space rocket to fly some beer out of the atmosphere is actually the best way to show that space is for all of us, if we can plan and execute a near-space rocket launch from our local pub, anyone can be part of the private space-race.Our plan is to raise enough funding to build and then launch a new record-breaking rocket later this year, one capable of flying over 30km high, leaving almost all of the Earth's atmosphere behind and doing so with a small payload of beer on board.This crowd-funding campaign is being run simultaneously with the brewing of a limited edition beer called 'Hop Rocket IPA' by the awesome team at Redwell Brewery in Norwich... the first beer brewed using hops which have been launched on a rocket!You will be able to follow our progress on the rocket and during the launch itself on our facebook page here: https://www.facebook.com/hoprocketrecord/Or on our website/blog here: http://www.hoprocketrecord.comThe Perks.Whether you're a space-geek or a beer-geek, backing this project gets you some cool things... Just by donating a few pounds to the project you get your name immortalised on the project website as a supporter, for a little more you can get your name on the rocket itself, attend a rocket launch and build your own rocket with your family, get tickets to exclusive events... and access to the limited edition 'Hop Rocket IPA' beer being brewed especially for this project. Most of all... you get the satisfaction of knowing that you have helped achieve something pretty awesome and brought a record back to the UK.IMPORTANT NOTE: We cannot offer alcohol as a perk for the project, as such what you will get instead is a ticket to attend an exclusive event for the project at which the Hop Rocket IPA beer will be available OR redeemable against an online purchase from Eebria.It should also be noted that perks such as items flown on board the altitude record etc are dependent on A: the rocket being launched and B: the rocket being safely recovered. That is NOT guaranteed though of course we will do our VERY best to give everyone who backs the project something awesome to show our gratitude for their assistance whether the project is 100% successful or not.The Rocket.In September of 2000 myself and a small group of friends had a crazy adventure. We designed and built a rocket in just 10 weeks to try and set a new altitude record at over 50,000ft (the highest we had flown before this was just 15,000ft). We flew the rocket out in a wooden crate to San Francisco and then drove in a rented RV across the western US to the desolate Black Rock desert. We camped in that RV for four days and, with the help of some awesome characters and a few late nights powered by energy drinks shared from urine-sample bottles (rocket scientists use whatever is to hand to solve a problem) we launched our rocket and achieved a new record.We set the altitude record at over 34,000ft (10km) with a rocket that defies the normal rules and takes a more 'extreme' approach to going high. The rocket, called 'Phobos EAV' was a boosted dart design. Conceived by NASA as a way to launch very small payloads cheaply to the very edge of the atmosphere a 'boosted dart' does exactly what it's name suggests...It's all about drag and momentum. By using a very high-thrust rocket engine a boosted dart accelerates rapidly to an extreme velocity and then releases a thin, heavy 'dart' that sits atop the rocket motor, imparting most of it's kinetic energy into something with VERY low drag. This tiny dart then 'coasts' up through the atmosphere as it gently decelerates, eventually turning around and falling back to Earth (hopefully intact).This design has the advantage of being able to send the dart section to a much higher altitude than a conventional rocket with the same amount of power could reach, but with the dissadvantage of A: being very small so not being able to carry much on it's journey, and B: everything on board the rocket needing to withstand massive acceleration at launch,The Phobos EAV rocket was an imperfect design. The 'dart' stayed stuck on top of the rocket for several seconds after it should have broken free due to an error in the design of the attachment joint. We have learnt what we did wrong and are ready to try again... only this time, we are going for broke.The new rocket has 35% more fuel than Phobos EAV and delivers over 3 times as much thrust. This new rocket will accelerate the dart to over 2000mph (nearly 3 times the speed of sound) in just over 1 second before releasing it. The smaller, more streamlined dart should then 'coast' for around a minute, reaching a peak altitude of over 100,000ft (30km) before beginning it's descent back to Earth, hopefully slowed down by a Kevlar 'para-streamer' which will be ejected from the dart using a small explosive charge.We hope to carry not only electronic altimeters and GPS systems on the dart to record how high it has gone but also at least one miniature camera, built to withstand this extreme flight and hopefully bring us back video from the edge of space.The Beer.This whole project is being conducted with the help of Redwell Brewery who's rocket-themed branding on their craft beers caught my eye in a local shop and who offered to help promote the campaign. To kick off the project and provide a tangible reward to be enjoyed by those who help with the project, Redwell asked me to help them create a unique one-off beer. On Saturday 30th April this year a big red rocket lifted off from the East Anglian countryside carrying 5kg of hops in it's payload bay. This rocket wasn't ever intended to set any altitude records but was just designed to carry it's precious organic cargo to around half a mile in altitude on a fiery joy-ride.The hops were recovered safely after the rocket parachuted back to the ground and were taken back to the brewery to begin the brewing process. As you read this, the awesome new 'Hop Rocket IPA' beer is being brewed and it should, we hope, be ready to try at the end of this campaign!We hope to be able to give some of this small batch of unique beer to the backers of this campaign (at exclusive supporter events) and to toast the successful record attempt with it later this year. We will also be carrying a small sample of the beer with us on board the altitude record rocket... fulfilling that life-long 'beer-in-space' dream.Why Help?
Launching rockets isn't cheap. It's cheaper than you might think, but it still costs money. We have turned to crowd-funding to raise the money for this project because we believe this is a genuinely cool project that not only brings a high-tech community science project to Norfolk and the glory of a record back to the UK but also inspires people to get involved in space science in a way that perhaps they never realised they could. Did you know, wherever you are in the UK there is probably an amateur rocketry club within a couple of hours of you that could help you build and launch your own rocket? Probably not, but it's true!
The funding we are asking for in this campaign will be spent on building the rocket itself (a task of small-scale but precision engineering), the electronic systems to go on board the dart (which will all need to be custom made and/or modified to withstand the flight), the fuel to power the rocket and, critically, the costs of getting the rocket and the small crew needed to launch it out to the only place remote enough to be able to safely launch something this extreme... the Black Rock desert in Nevada, site of Britain's past world land speed record glory and proven experimental rocket launching location.Other ways to helpIn addition to just donating to this campaign, it would be GREAT if you can share this campaign far and wide, encourage your friends and family to support us too. If you run (or know someone who runs) a relevant business in Norfolk or Suffolk and think you can help by donating goods or services to the project then that would be great as it allows us to allocate more of the funds raised to the other aspects of the project. Specific things we need help with include:

Miniature digital cameras/action cameras


Precision metalworking - Turning of steel parts


Precision metalworking - Fabrication/welding of sheet steel parts


Precision metalworking -  Turning of aluminium parts


Electronics engineering, specifically GPS and radio tracking systems


Electronics engineering - hardening/encapsulation of electronics for high-stress environments.

Logistics/travel for valuable/delicate goods and people to/from the western USA.

<b>Short
Summary</b><br/>
</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The goal of our Swords
into Plowshares campaign is to convert retired, de-commissioned military tanks
into civilian earthmovers, bulldozers, excavators and agricultural tractors.
 This is the first (ever) crowdfunding campaign for this type of
industry. </p>
<p>Our agenda
addresses disarmament, sustainability, and economic and business development.
 We are confident in our ability to make this agenda a reality.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F171306611&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F171306611&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F576754612_640.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><h2><b>What We
Need &amp; What You Get</b></h2>
<p></p>
<p>We are looking to
raise $300,000. This will enable us to:</p>
<p> 1.
 Conduct an original design for a bulldozer/excavator kit mounted on refurbished
tanks.</p>
<p>2.  Explore
the availability of retired tanks in many countries around the world.</p>
<p>3.  Create a
design for refurbished tanks, which will include the removal of the gun and
turret, installation of a new driver cabin and auxiliariesand an increase in traction.  </p>
<p>4.  In the
second phase, we plan to raise $2 million from various foundations, by crowdfunding,
from corporate partners, venture capitalists, economic development authorities,
and governments. We will test pilots with different tanks, develop project
finance, develop rental networks for the bulldozers, and (most importantly)
develop spare parts supply channels; we are currently discussing this
agenda with manufacturers in Poland, Slovakia and Czech Republic that will
supply spare parts on long term basis.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>       <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466195095/Screen_Shot_2016-06-17_at_4.23.00_PM_fru2dl.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>5.  As for
perks, we (obviously) cannot provide a bulldozer to the donors…. We will,
however, provide a few perks see a list. 
If and when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) makes the
decision to allow equity crowd funding, and if the venture decides to conduct
equity crowdfunding some donors will be informed so they may decide to take
part in future equity offering. </p>

<p>We
plan to start with the Soviet made “T55” tanks (the most produced tank in
history) and then onto US retired tanks.  The “T55” can be found in more
than 50 countries- most of which are developing countries.  The conversion
of these tanks will be done using local machine shops and labor. This will
provide a boost for economic development and provide inexpensive heavy
machinery necessary for infrastructural development.  We, also, plan to
help these developing countries obtain financing from world organizations that
are involved with international aid.</p><p></p><p>         <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466196549/Screen_Shot_2016-06-17_at_4.47.50_PM_mgtlnx.png"" src="""" style=""width: 508.28959276018094px;height: 222px;""/></p><br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465517792/bulldozer_excavator_eqoait.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><a href=""http://web.mit.edu/alamaro/www/swordsintoplowshares/bulldozer_excavator.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">

<p><b><i>What is the main premise of your concept for
Swords into Plowshares?</i></b></p>
<p>The attributes of military tanks
lead to the following conclusions:</p>
<p>      1. The rate of obsolescence of tanks is fast, determined
by military    objectives (changes of armor, munitions, etc.) rather than wear and
tear.</p>
<p>      2. Tanks spend most of their lifetime in storage waiting
for the next war.</p>
<p>      3. Save for a few hundred
hours of operation during training, even
30-year-old tanks are in good mechanical condition.</p>
<p>     4. Military tanks are designed for speed and cruising in
difficult terrains (mud, sand, hills, trenches, etc.)

</p><p><span>    5. Military tanks are more powerful than large commercial
bulldozers.</span></p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p><b><i>What kinds of modifications are required?</i></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The turret and gun of the tank will be removed, and a new,
modern driver cabin will be installed. The cabin should comply with OSHA
regulations, so the driver will be protected in the event of a toppling. 
A new hydraulic pump, a new kit of dozers, and shovel or blade is
required.  Most likely, the tank will also require a new engine that
complies with emission regulations.</p>
<p>Because tanks are designed for speed and bulldozers
operate in lower speeds, it might be necessary to add a low gear that enables
operation in lower speed, but higher RPM.  Also, the crawlers of the tank
might be modified to increase traction.</p>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><i>Can tanks be easily converted into
bulldozers?</i></b></p>
<p>Yes. The engineering corps of every military uses their
tanks as bulldozers for digging trenches, building bridges and other engineering
functions.  The power of tank’s motor is comparable
to that of a large commercial bulldozer.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465517437/bulldozer_blade_tulrrl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><a href=""http://web.mit.edu/alamaro/www/swordsintoplowshares/bulldozer_blade.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>

<p>This is a tough question; some countries will refuse to

Summary


The goal of our Swords
into Plowshares campaign is to convert retired, de-commissioned military tanks
into civilian earthmovers, bulldozers, excavators and agricultural tractors.
 This is the first (ever) crowdfunding campaign for this type of
industry. 
Our agenda
addresses disarmament, sustainability, and economic and business development.
 We are confident in our ability to make this agenda a reality.What We
Need & What You Get

We are looking to
raise $300,000. This will enable us to:
 1.
 Conduct an original design for a bulldozer/excavator kit mounted on refurbished
tanks.
2.  Explore
the availability of retired tanks in many countries around the world.
3.  Create a
design for refurbished tanks, which will include the removal of the gun and
turret, installation of a new driver cabin and auxiliariesand an increase in traction.  
4.  In the
second phase, we plan to raise $2 million from various foundations, by crowdfunding,
from corporate partners, venture capitalists, economic development authorities,
and governments. We will test pilots with different tanks, develop project
finance, develop rental networks for the bulldozers, and (most importantly)
develop spare parts supply channels; we are currently discussing this
agenda with manufacturers in Poland, Slovakia and Czech Republic that will
supply spare parts on long term basis.       
5.  As for
perks, we (obviously) cannot provide a bulldozer to the donors…. We will,
however, provide a few perks see a list. 
If and when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) makes the
decision to allow equity crowd funding, and if the venture decides to conduct
equity crowdfunding some donors will be informed so they may decide to take
part in future equity offering. 


The
Impact
The
premise of this campaign is based on two main assumptions:
1. 
The rate of
obsolescence of tanks is fast. It is determined by military objectives
(changes of armor, munitions, etc.,) rather than wear and tear.
2. 
Tanks spend
most of their lifetime in storage waiting for the next war.Except for
a few hundreds hours of operation for training, (even) 30 years old tanks are
in good mechanical condition.


We
plan to start with the Soviet made “T55” tanks (the most produced tank in
history) and then onto US retired tanks.  The “T55” can be found in more
than 50 countries- most of which are developing countries.  The conversion
of these tanks will be done using local machine shops and labor. This will
provide a boost for economic development and provide inexpensive heavy
machinery necessary for infrastructural development.  We, also, plan to
help these developing countries obtain financing from world organizations that
are involved with international aid.

Our
team and (potential) industrial partners in Poland and Slovakia used to
manufacture the “T55” and retain the necessary technical expertise.

Risks & Challenges
There
are always risks and challenges when entering into a phase of ""me too"" competition. We believe that we have the advantage of being
the ""first mover."" Most likely, the new bulldozers will not be
purchased, initially, so we plan to develop a worldwide rental operation.
 This agenda is global in scope, so it will encounter some technical and
execution- related challenges.  Once the pilots are proven to be effective,
we will develop a management team of experienced executives
with international expertise.         Other
Ways You Can Help

We
are looking forward to hearing from each and every one of you and, of course,
to your donation.  FAQ
What is the main premise of your concept for
Swords into Plowshares?
The attributes of military tanks
lead to the following conclusions:
      1. The rate of obsolescence of tanks is fast, determined
by military    objectives (changes of armor, munitions, etc.) rather than wear and
tear.
      2. Tanks spend most of their lifetime in storage waiting
for the next war.
      3. Save for a few hundred
hours of operation during training, even
30-year-old tanks are in good mechanical condition.
     4. Military tanks are designed for speed and cruising in
difficult terrains (mud, sand, hills, trenches, etc.)

    5. Military tanks are more powerful than large commercial
bulldozers.


What kinds of modifications are required?


The turret and gun of the tank will be removed, and a new,
modern driver cabin will be installed. The cabin should comply with OSHA
regulations, so the driver will be protected in the event of a toppling. 
A new hydraulic pump, a new kit of dozers, and shovel or blade is
required.  Most likely, the tank will also require a new engine that
complies with emission regulations.
Because tanks are designed for speed and bulldozers
operate in lower speeds, it might be necessary to add a low gear that enables
operation in lower speed, but higher RPM.  Also, the crawlers of the tank
might be modified to increase traction.


Click Here to Enlarge Image
Can tanks be easily converted into
bulldozers?
Yes. The engineering corps of every military uses their
tanks as bulldozers for digging trenches, building bridges and other engineering
functions.  The power of tank’s motor is comparable
to that of a large commercial bulldozer.
Click Here to Enlarge Image
What is the business of your venture?
First, we will serve as intermediaries for those who have
tanks and those who can provide the engineering for conversion.  Then, we will test pilots, provide a few
designs and help with the development of project finance programs.  Finally, we will facilitate the rental
operation of the new bulldozers.

Why Rental? 
Why not sell (outright) the new bulldozers?
Initially buyers might be reluctant to purchase the new
bulldozers, so rental seems more feasible.  It does not entail a financial risk for the customers.  After a few years of operation, (when credibility
is established) the bulldozers might be sold.The bulldozer industry is increasingly reliant upon the
notion of bulldozer rental.  “Yard Club”,
a Silicon Valley start-up, matches excess bulldozer capacity with those who
want to rent.  Caterpillar Corporation
and Kleiner Perkins are Yard’s investors.

Can you transfer retired tanks across borders?
This is a tough question; some countries will refuse to
transfer or export tanks that may be used again for military applications.  Therefore, we plan to first strip the tank in
the country (where it is found) of its turret and gun.  We also propose that the engineering
conversion is done at the country (where the tank is found) using local machine
shops and labor.  For developing
countries, this will provide economic development and access to inexpensive
machinery required for infrastructure development.  These countries might also be eligible for
financial assistance from world organizations.

What if military organizations request your services?
We are committed to provide and assist only
civilian projects.  We will not take part
in any military missions.  We ask
participating parties to refrain from giving any military confidential
information, since all the information we gather will be open to the public.

      
Why do you plan to start using retired

have been successfully revived for active operation?

These engineering companies are excited about the business opportunity

will also help us with the pilot development.
Who are your competitors?  Can you protect your technologies?
This is a “brick and mortar” venture where patents are
less relevant.  Our main advantage is
being the “first mover.”  It will attract
small competitors who will most likely not be major movers (i.e. Caterpillar
Corporation or Komatsu.)  It is possible,
however, that after demonstrating viability, a large company will buy our
venture.  Alternatively, it is quite
possible that a certain agency of a foreign government will purchase our
venture or (at least) a portion of it.

Why not smelt the retired tank for its steel?

The prevailing prices of steel are on the order of ~$500
per ton.  A 40-ton tank will provide about $20,000 worth of steel. 
This is not much relative to the work and cost that goes into building the
tank.  The tank vehicle’s worth could be in the hundreds of thousand
dollars.
What might be the cost of your new bulldozer?

We estimate that a converted tank into a bulldozer will
cost ~$250,000.  The cost of a used 4 year old large D9 commercial
bulldozer could be in the range of ~$750,000.
What are the benefits and the ultimate goals
of your venture?
Our venture addresses the most wasteful sector of the
world economy. We plan to cut in on this waste, beginning with the re-manufacturing
of retired tanks, providing manufacturing jobs and providing the inexpensive heavy
machinery required for infrastructure development in developing countries.
Based on the lessons learned, we plan to expand and use
other retired military equipment and develop additional sustainable lines of
business for applications worldwide.

The Story 
My name is Lauren Gregg and I am a professional mountain biker and the founder of Turn Loose. Discovering my passion in mountain biking was the best thing that ever happened to me and I'm now living out of my van and traveling the world riding my bike. Turn Loose is my way of paying it forward and inspiring people to chase their dreams, get outside of their comfort zones, and do more of what makes them happy.

Turn Loose will support and share stories that inspire change. It’s not about encouraging everyone to ditch their job and move into the mountains– it’s about sharing stories that can motivate even the smallest of changes, like going for a hike instead of working late, or finally taking that art class you’ve been dreaming about.


Obtaining cash support for projects has always been the number one struggle in my career. It’s relatively easy to get gear, but gear is no good if you can’t pay for gas or a plane ticket to where you need to go! Racing, competitions, and travel can be very difficult expenses for budding athletes. Turn Loose seeks to address these issues. People with the ideas and motivation for inspiring projects can come to Turn Loose for funding and Turn Loose will sponsor up-and-coming athletes with cash support creating stories to share with the community- a cycle of inspiration and support.


The Turn Loose Press   
We will share these stories online, and in the Turn Loose Press, a physical print that will arrive on community members’ doorsteps to be enjoyed over a cup of coffee before being made into a paper airplane.

Hardwoods like oak take at least forty years to mature before they can be harvested. Almost 1 million acres of forests are lost each week worldwide to deforestation. Bamboo absorbs carbon dioxide and releases 35% more oxygen into the atmosphere than the equivalent in hardwood trees<strong>. </strong>Also, when Bamboo is used for building, very little of the plant is wasted. Joy will grow the Bamboo himself on site, thus meaning there will be no petrol used for transportation of materials.

When the hotel is open, Joy will provide free drinking water, reducing the need for buying bottles of water and will aim to use the least environmentally damaging products for maintaining the property, All food cooked at the lodge will be made from locally-grown produce. </span>

Kyuakme is an incredibly beautiful, yet off the-beaten-track place to visit in Myanmar.

<br/><p>          ""The trekking is usually to Palaung villages. The Palaung which are the main ethnic group in the area, make a living from cultivating and trading tea, cutting wood and trading herbal plants. Originally, Palaung descended from the mountains in the South of China thousands of years ago. There are many types of Palaung but two live in this region. They are Shwe Palaung (Gold Palaung) and Ngwe Palaung (Silver Palaung). You can tell the difference by the colour of their belts, which are made of bamboo and a kind of long grass. They have beautiful traditional costumes weaved of different-coloured fabric. It is interesting how they wear the traditional dress in their daily lives, as normally people in Myanmar only  wear their traditional clothes when a festival is celebrated. You can see Palaung people picking tea leaves on the hillside, steaming tea leaves and scattering them in the sun for drying. They produce three kinds of tea which are green tea, pickled tea and tea powder. Most families still live in the typical houses made of bamboo and thatch and with a small garden in front. It is also extremely interesting to learn about their culture and religion. They consider themselves as Buddhists but they also hold spiritual beliefs. Each village has a beautiful Nat Shrine. They call it Zhao Main which means King of Nat. They believe that the Nat has supernatural power that is able to help people with business and health problems and protect the village from various disasters. They have many interesting stories concerned about spirits. Once you get in the village, you'll encounter everybody welcoming you to have a seat in the house and a cup of tea. The children there think you might be from another planet because they don't see tourists often and some of them even run a way as soon as they see you. People in the mountains are also happy to meet you and curious to know how people live in western world as it's quite a rare opportunity and they don't travel a lot."" - <i>Joy.

</div></div>","We are looking to raise funds to construct an Eco-lodge, Meditation Centre, Shan Cooking School and Training Centre for Underprivileged Youths in Myanmar.

My name is Eleanor I am running this campaign on behalf of Joy, a local English and Tourism teacher and Tour Guide in Kyaukme, Shan State, Myanmar. It is Joy's ambition to build a center dedicated to assisting local youths gain invaluable vocational skills, to preserving local traditions through the teaching of Shan cooking and providing visitors to Kyaukme with a eco-friendly and peaceful retreat and meditation centre in the beautiful mountains of Shan State, Myanmar.

Myanmar is ranked as a country with Low Human Development according to the UNDP. It faces a multitude of barriers to development.
 


'Myanmar is rich in resources, including oil, timber, gas and gems, but remains one of the world’s poorest countries... There has been an exodus of young people seeking work in neighbouring Thailand; people trafficking is endemic.' - Gethin Chamberlain, reporting for The Guardian


Furthermore, young  people face significant barriers to education. A recent study has found that 1 in 5 children miss school - http://goo.gl/Tok0uo -as they instead need to work in order to support their families.



Palaung Women Sheltering from the Rain



Myanmar is also benefiting from a boom in tourism in recent years. Joy has over ten years experience in the tourism sector of Kyaukme and has seen that this boom can help to transform the lives of young people in the area. Tour-guiding is the most lucrative form of work in the area. At the moment, young people have limited options when it comes to work; they must leave the town and be separated from their families. Employment opportunities are further limited by lack of access to formal education, which many youths experience. However, through education in foreign languages and in tourism, Joy will be able to assist young people in gaining the qualifications they need in order to become a certified guide in Kyaukme.

The style of the training centre and guesthouse that will be created.



The Bamboo Project has a number of ambitions - 

- To create a space where unprivileged young people can benefit from learning the skills needed to work within the tourism industry. 

Joy has been working as a teacher and tour guide (http://shanprinces.webs.com/) for over ten years and has a plethora of experience in delivering  this training. Being a guide is the only way for young people in the community to earn a decent  living salary. It is also one of the few roles in the area which is not  dangerous, such as mining or factory work.  It is a role which allows the any young person to not have to face separation from their family, which is endemic in Kyaukme despite being extremely damaging as Myanmar has an extremely family-orientated culture.
The lodge will also be the only guesthouse in the area outside of the main town, providing visitors with the opportunity to experience the serenity and beauty of the natural landscape surrounding Kyaukme.


- To operate a Shan Cooking School, helping to educate people about and preserving the local Shan culture.


- To provide a peaceful place where visitors can benefit from learning the art of meditation in a beautiful natural setting.

- To create the first guesthouse in the area which looks to minimise its environmental impact.

Joy aims to build and maintain his guesthouse in the most environmentally sustainable way he can. The lodge will be mostly made of Bamboo. Bamboo is prized as an environmentally-friendly alternative to hardwood. This is because Bamboo grows extremely quickly, thus reducing the negative impact of deforestation.  Depending on the species, bamboo can be harvested in one to five years. Hardwoods like oak take at least forty years to mature before they can be harvested. Almost 1 million acres of forests are lost each week worldwide to deforestation. Bamboo absorbs carbon dioxide and releases 35% more oxygen into the atmosphere than the equivalent in hardwood trees. Also, when Bamboo is used for building, very little of the plant is wasted. Joy will grow the Bamboo himself on site, thus meaning there will be no petrol used for transportation of materials. Furthermore, where hardwood is needed, he will use wood reclaimed from local house demolitions. He will also source any furniture needed from local house demolitions, again reducing the environmental toll of petrol emissions. The environment will be considered during every step of the hotel build, from the building of the structure, to the selection of furnishings and fittings to the running of the hotel itself . When the hotel is open, Joy will provide free drinking water, reducing the need for buying bottles of water and will aim to use the least environmentally damaging products for maintaining the property, All food cooked at the lodge will be made from locally-grown produce.

What We Need & What You Get

Your money will go towards the materials needed in order to build the education centre and guesthouse. Joy has already purchased the land necessary and will be building the school himself.

$1500 will cover the the License for the guesthouse.

$10,000 will be used to build ten rooms - in order to get a hotel license in Myanmar, your establishment must have at least ten rooms. This money will cover the cost of the materials, labour, furniture, furnishings, plumbing etc, 
$1500 will be spent on organising electricity  for the hotel and will be used to pay for the government license, for payment to the village chief to gain permission to install it and the wires, poles, bulbs, sockets and meters

The tourism boom in Myanmar, which has begun to have huge positive effects in certain areas, is being stunted in Kyaukme due to the lack of decent hotel options. Currently there is no hotel that Western Tourists are happy to stay in for more than a night or two, due to issues with cleanliness and noise. This is having a huge negative effect on the potentially transformative effect tourism can have in Kyaukme in providing secure jobs and generating income. By building a hotel that meets the needs of tourists, I hope to increase tourism within Kyaukme, thus creating more safe and local jobs for youths.



By kindly donating to this cause, you will have a huge positive impact of the local community. You will give young people the skills to be able to find safe, decent paid jobs, You will ensure that they are able to stay with their families and not face the potential dangers faced by Myanmar workers overseas. You will help the development of an area plagued by poverty, within the third poorest country in the whole of Asia.

About dad:

Bülent. 60 years old, typical workaholic. 

Has spent most of his life working way too much to support his family, and hasn’t really had the chance to truly enjoy life.One day he realised he's had enough, retired straight away, and... well... spent all his pension funds on an Africa Twin 2016 to travel the world. (Good call, dad! Not the best example of money management though, is it? :D )
His first trip starts in June 2016 from Turkey, cuts through gorgeous lands of Iran, Pakistan and India, and finally ends in Nepal in approximately 2 months. 
Once he arrives in Nepal, he will announce his next route. (And so on...)
He will share interviews with locals and other wanderers he meets on the road, and all sorts of other videos  via his blog, Ride 2 Liveliness, where you will also find road notes, trip updates, live streams, and various other posts by him.
He's planning to complete his world tour in 2019.

The reason I started this campaign was the very strong desire to help my dad to make his ""ultimate dream"" come true, as he's always supported me for who I am and whatever it was I wanted to do. (Thanks a lot, and good luck,dad!) 
And the deal?
 OK... It's pretty straight forward. Basically, we're trying to fund the kickstart for dad's world tour, Ride 2 Liveliness. We need $5000 to approximately cover:
- Accommodation, food and fuel untill Nepal: $2400 ($40 per day)
- Border passes, technical maintenance, data storage, mobile internet, potential medical expenditures.
- Kickstart money for route #2 (TBA): After Nepal, dad will start collecting and selling tiny souvenirs on the road to finance the rest of the tour himself. So, he will need some startup capital for that too. :)

<p><strong>SUPPORT - WOMEN’S SMALL BUSINESS INITIATIVE!</strong></p>
<p>Our small business sector is the fastest-growing, most diverse, greatest contributor of new jobs to our local, national and global economy. Did you know that?</p>
<p>ü  There are nearly 11.3 million women owned businesses in the United States; employing nearly 9 million and generating over $1.6 trillion in revenues (Source: NAWBO).</p>
<p>ü  Small businesses make up more than 99.7% of all employers in the country and employ half of all private sector employees.</p>
<p>ü  More than 45% of the private sector payroll is generated by small business.</p>
<p>ü  Over the last decade, small businesses have accounted for 60 to 80% of all new jobs created on an annual basis.</p>
<p>ü  Employees at small businesses produce 13 to 14 times more patents than those employed by larger companies.</p>
<p>ü  Small businesses create more than 50 percent of the non-farm private gross domestic product (GDP).</p>
<p>ü  The 22.9 million small businesses in the United States are located in virtually every neighborhood and small businesses employ about 50 percent of all private sector workers.</p>

Our small business sector is the fastest-growing, most diverse, greatest contributor of new jobs to our local, national and global economy. Did you know that?
ü  There are nearly 11.3 million women owned businesses in the United States; employing nearly 9 million and generating over $1.6 trillion in revenues (Source: NAWBO).
ü  Small businesses make up more than 99.7% of all employers in the country and employ half of all private sector employees.
ü  More than 45% of the private sector payroll is generated by small business.
ü  Over the last decade, small businesses have accounted for 60 to 80% of all new jobs created on an annual basis.
ü  Employees at small businesses produce 13 to 14 times more patents than those employed by larger companies.
ü  Small businesses create more than 50 percent of the non-farm private gross domestic product (GDP).
ü  The 22.9 million small businesses in the United States are located in virtually every neighborhood and small businesses employ about 50 percent of all private sector workers.

My background includes, management, graphic design and minor programming.<br/>  <br/>One more second before we get into this campaign, our Company. Our company is called <strong>Illusion Games LLC</strong>, we formed in June of this year, 2016. The sole purpose of our company is to make games by gamers for gamers. As you read before, we play and love games, in all their forms. We’ve played card games, console games, pc games and various tabletop games, and we plan to use all of our combined experience to create them as well. You heard me right, we plan to get into all areas of gaming, from creating brand new twists on loved-genres to mechanic breaking games in the digital world. We have a huge love for games and you will see that in all of our creations.<br/>  <br/>On to the campaign, as you can see games are important to us and our family and friends. We are wanting to build our business and raise the funds so that all of our ideas will eventually come to fruitition, we understand that not all of our ideas are gold and we have realized which of them isn’t great. We strongly believe in all the games and concepts, good or bad we have come up with, we have a process of keeping even the worst ideas available because maybe a small change or adjustment can make them amazing! We have started making prototype games and testing multiples of our games so that we can release our games quickly. Currently we have 3 games designed and in testing, 2 more ready for design and development and countless waiting in our many, many notebooks.<br/>  Now this is where you all come in, with your help, and potential funding you will help us take this from starting to started. These funds, while they seem like a lot, will give the opportunity to move our business to a new location and give my wife her dining room back, as well as hire more personnel, better equipment, extra licensing and most importantly time. Time is what we need, and by sharing this campaign which could give someone the opportunity to fund or by funding this campaign yourself, YOU all are helping us save time getting our dreams to come to life.<br/><br/>What your contributions will specifically be helping us achieve will be:<br/>1.) A place for the business, we plan on using a portion to lease or purchase a place for the business to run out of, like I said earlier, that isn’t    a dining room.<br/>2.) The ability to focus a lot more time on the company and our products, we have families, full-time jobs and various other responsibilities. This money will gives us the peace of mind to have the ability to focus on our company like it’s our lives, but if you read earlier it’s a big part of all our lives.<br/>3.) Better equipment, we have various skill sets to be able to produce and create an amazing end-game product, but lack the funding to have the equipment to match that.<br/>4.) Personnel, we have busy lives, like I mentioned two points ago, so being able to hire extra people lets us produce games faster, since we will have the time (mentioned earlier) and the people to get things moving fast.<br/>5.) Finally finishing up our license and formation requirements that we can’t fully complete on our own.<br/><br/>    Again with your help and with the perks that are in place, our amazing mold-breaking games will be available for everyone to enjoy. We know many of you have played games and had ideas, but never submitted them to the company because you know they won’t read your suggestions or possibly didn’t know how to. We want to change that, feedback, opinions, questions and comments are ALWAYS welcome. Not only that but we want to give opportunity to all, employment wise. Now have you ever read through job ads and see something similar to “Want 5-8 years of experience in this field.”? Well we want experience but are willing to give new artists and programmers the chance to prove they are as capable as others in the same field. So essentially, you are helping us not only create molding-breaking new games, but change the face of business as well.<br/><br/>    Now we know that running a business isn’t always pleasant, we will have obstacles and hurdles even after we have the funding to proceed. Some of them being, programming/bugs, manufacturer’s schedules, print errors, or slow development. All of these can be big problems, but we plan to handle these as quickly and efficiently as possible. If we can create, develop and manufacture on an early schedule, all of these errors will not be felt by anyone. Our biggest hurdle and obstacle in this market will be Big Name Competition. Most if not all of you are familiar with creators like Activision, Hasbro, Bethesda, Mattel and Blizzard. Well we might not have the big name behind us yet, but our fresh, creative and innovative games will be able to compete in the market with them. We have confidence that we will overcome any and all obstacles in our way.<br/><br/>   All that being said we appreciate any comments, feedback and questions, feel free to email us @ <strong>illusiongamesllc@gmail.com</strong> , we will try to answer you within 24 hours, but please bear with us if it’s later than that.

<h3>A SNO CONE BUS WITH A VERY BIG MISSION</h3>
<p>Hi, I’m Melita Carter, owner of Royal Sno Young Entrepreneurs Program. Thanks for visiting and for considering a contribution to help obtain our bus and begin to cultivate young entrepreneurs. <br/><br/>Royal Sno's  sno cone bus will be shaved ice deliciousness on wheels, taking the finest of snow cone syrup with the option of all-natural syrup for hot sizzling summer days. Royal Sno will be out on Indianapolis roads to cities and towns, markets and music festivals, wherever people crave the taste of a sweet ice shaven sno cone on blazing hot Indy days.<br/><br/>This project isn't just about sno cones. It’s about helping cultivate young entrepreneurs for them to be able to take care of themselves and their families by exposing them to the idea of entrepreneurship. By teaching them how to fish- coupling their education with a hands-on sweat equity experience, they will break the cycles of generational poverty, create generational wealth, reduce crime that is systemically created by the lack of proper financial education  and develop a robust commerce community.   The young inspiring entrepreneurs will spread their knowledge of financial literacy from the window of the sno cone bus in hopes of inspiring others to learn more about how money works and plant the seed needed to inspire future  entrepreneurs.  I want to help my students and their families develop a new money mindset by showing how it plays into their everyday lives and  eradicating the mentality that they are only consumers. I want to inspire them to consider being an owner of a product or service that others can purchase or use.  I’m talking about young entrepreneurs and sno cones rolling around our city creating MAGNIFICENT magic when you walk up to the window of Royal Sno.</p>
<p><strong>OUR GOAL IS TO GET THE SNO CONE BUS OPERATIONAL AND ON THE ROAD BY LATE SPRING 2017</strong>. You can track via our Facebook at: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/royalsno/?fref=hovercard"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/royalsno/?fref=hovercard</a></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">This is a rendering of the Royal Sno cone bus will look like.  </p>
<p><b>WHAT'S THE BACK STORY?</b></p>
<p>If you know me, you know that I am madly and passionately in love with children, community, self-development, self-efficacy, and self-sufficiency. I am currently serving young people and I have been serving young people in many capacities for the past 16 years from youth advocate, informal foster parenting, mentor, and youth development facilitator.  Over the past few years, I have been self-teaching about financial literacy of the stock market and the importance of ownership to your overall quality of life. After careful strategic studying and understanding, I have realized many people who surround me do not know how money works and how their lack of proper financial education is tied to their familial cycles of generational poverty. One day I asked my classroom full of students between the ages of 14-16 years old, ""Who makes more money, the owner or the worker?""  They all replied in a loud unison ""The worker."" My heart immediately shattered because I knew from their response they had no idea about entrepreneurship and how money works. Because of my passion for self-sufficiency, I went on a journey to create an innovative program that will not only teach young people the power of entrepreneurship but will also give them a kinesthetic experience to tangibly lock-in the education.  In addition, I will teach them how to maintain a business with a servant leader's heart. During the second year of the program, the young entrepreneurs will be paired with a mentor  who owns a successful business in the area of their interest. They will shadow this successful entrepreneur to gain more behind the scenes knowledge and advice about their desired industry. Through this experience, it is my hope they will learn the pros and cons to provide them with a more solid foundation for their business to ultimately create a more sustainable business in the future.  As a lifelong learner, I live in the constant state of learning to ensure I am able to teach and help others break down barriers and overcome insurmountable obstacles.  All I require to those I teach is for them to help others.  My dream is to cultivate young people whom the world has deemed ineligible to rise from their ashes like a Phoenix and ferociously move forward into highly sophisticated and intellectually superior entrepreneurs. Royal's Sno philosophy is the ancient proverb that states <strong>""Feed a man/woman a fish and they will eat for a day, but TEACH a woman/man and they EAT for a LIFETIME."" </strong></p>

A SNO CONE BUS WITH A VERY BIG MISSION
Hi, I’m Melita Carter, owner of Royal Sno Young Entrepreneurs Program. Thanks for visiting and for considering a contribution to help obtain our bus and begin to cultivate young entrepreneurs. Royal Sno's  sno cone bus will be shaved ice deliciousness on wheels, taking the finest of snow cone syrup with the option of all-natural syrup for hot sizzling summer days. Royal Sno will be out on Indianapolis roads to cities and towns, markets and music festivals, wherever people crave the taste of a sweet ice shaven sno cone on blazing hot Indy days.This project isn't just about sno cones. It’s about helping cultivate young entrepreneurs for them to be able to take care of themselves and their families by exposing them to the idea of entrepreneurship. By teaching them how to fish- coupling their education with a hands-on sweat equity experience, they will break the cycles of generational poverty, create generational wealth, reduce crime that is systemically created by the lack of proper financial education  and develop a robust commerce community.   The young inspiring entrepreneurs will spread their knowledge of financial literacy from the window of the sno cone bus in hopes of inspiring others to learn more about how money works and plant the seed needed to inspire future  entrepreneurs.  I want to help my students and their families develop a new money mindset by showing how it plays into their everyday lives and  eradicating the mentality that they are only consumers. I want to inspire them to consider being an owner of a product or service that others can purchase or use.  I’m talking about young entrepreneurs and sno cones rolling around our city creating MAGNIFICENT magic when you walk up to the window of Royal Sno.
OUR GOAL IS TO GET THE SNO CONE BUS OPERATIONAL AND ON THE ROAD BY LATE SPRING 2017. You can track via our Facebook at: https://www.facebook.com/royalsno/?fref=hovercard

This is a rendering of the Royal Sno cone bus will look like.  
WHAT'S THE BACK STORY?
If you know me, you know that I am madly and passionately in love with children, community, self-development, self-efficacy, and self-sufficiency. I am currently serving young people and I have been serving young people in many capacities for the past 16 years from youth advocate, informal foster parenting, mentor, and youth development facilitator.  Over the past few years, I have been self-teaching about financial literacy of the stock market and the importance of ownership to your overall quality of life. After careful strategic studying and understanding, I have realized many people who surround me do not know how money works and how their lack of proper financial education is tied to their familial cycles of generational poverty. One day I asked my classroom full of students between the ages of 14-16 years old, ""Who makes more money, the owner or the worker?""  They all replied in a loud unison ""The worker."" My heart immediately shattered because I knew from their response they had no idea about entrepreneurship and how money works. Because of my passion for self-sufficiency, I went on a journey to create an innovative program that will not only teach young people the power of entrepreneurship but will also give them a kinesthetic experience to tangibly lock-in the education.  In addition, I will teach them how to maintain a business with a servant leader's heart. During the second year of the program, the young entrepreneurs will be paired with a mentor  who owns a successful business in the area of their interest. They will shadow this successful entrepreneur to gain more behind the scenes knowledge and advice about their desired industry. Through this experience, it is my hope they will learn the pros and cons to provide them with a more solid foundation for their business to ultimately create a more sustainable business in the future.  As a lifelong learner, I live in the constant state of learning to ensure I am able to teach and help others break down barriers and overcome insurmountable obstacles.  All I require to those I teach is for them to help others.  My dream is to cultivate young people whom the world has deemed ineligible to rise from their ashes like a Phoenix and ferociously move forward into highly sophisticated and intellectually superior entrepreneurs. Royal's Sno philosophy is the ancient proverb that states ""Feed a man/woman a fish and they will eat for a day, but TEACH a woman/man and they EAT for a LIFETIME."" 
 

What Does Royal Sno Need? Hey! Thanks for Asking!  
The Royal Sno social enterprise  needs a total of $70,000!  
How will the funds be spent?

To cut the initial startup cost for the program we have located a used sno cone bus. The seller has been pleasant, patient, and helpful and have given us a huge discount on the bus. The owner is selling all start-up equipment including the bus and an extra generator for the total amount of  $50,000. 

The remainder of the funds will be used to relocate the bus from 1,000 miles away to its new home in Indianapolis. A couple of months ago I made the trip to where the bus is located and did a scheduled event with the current owner and afterwards checked over the bus with a fine tooth comb. Also, the funds will be used to cover initial maintenance expenses (new brakes, fixing the sun faded decals on the bus, tune-up, oil change, detailed inspection, registration fees, and initial program material) and initial stationary material for each individual student for the entrepreneur education department of the program which includes 3 program laptops, carrying bags, computer insurance, and computer security.

In this LRAD programme the government undertakes to support initiatives aimed at developing previously disadvantaged rural areas to help them access land specifically for agricultural purposes, or to make better use of land already accessed. But one of the criteria that need to be satisfied in order to qualify for the grant, is that you must be in a position to make your own contribution (monetary or otherwise) before they can give you the 60%  or more of the rest of the required funding for the project.  We have already accessed land from a few local people who are currently farming the land and they have pledged land to us which straddles the Tugela river and amounts to 10 hectares and more. We have also secured 106 hectares from the local King who has expressed great enthusiasm and excitement about the project.  Once we get a valuator to give us a price for how much the land is worth, the amount will be added towards our contribution. So the money we raise with this campaign will be used to fund the start-up of the project but more importantly it will serve as a bridge to a bigger grant from the government once they see that we have also raised our own capital to contribute towards the project. Below you’ll find a little bit of information about our project, the area which we wish to start in as well as a brief introduction into the team behind this initiative.</p><p><strong><u>A summary of our project</u></strong></p><p>Industrialisation has been a key vehicle for success in present day major economies, ranging from the old powers rooted in colonialism (Great Britain) and looking at the new emerging powers (China) and everything in between (America). These economies all had one common thread leading to their success and this was industrialisation. If one considers South Africa, we have more rural, open land than we know what to do with. Indeed most people are moving away from the rural areas and going into urban areas as they are under the impression that their success lies in those areas. This is a sorely misplaced idea and is one which we as South Africa will pay for dearly as townships will increase, resources with which to help the people moving into townships will still be at a minimum and crime will increase as people become desperate.</p><p><i>Aim of the project</i></p><p>We as Spes Legacies wish to create an alternative narrative in rural area development, urbanisation, poverty alleviation, job creation and indeed education in rural areas. </p><p>Spes legacies will do is to create an environment in the area of uMsinga where the people unite under one cause and one goal; poverty alleviation, job creation and education. We will do this by bringing together all the small farmers into a single entity where they will continue farming their lands but under the supervision of the company which will bring experts in the field of farming. This will help the small holder farmers to maximise the use of their agricultural land. Spes Legacies is set on creating 600 new jobs through this venture, which will create professional jobs in marketing and sales, bookkeeping and farm labourer jobs, tractor drivers, truck drivers and work in a warehouse where there will be washing, packaging and storage of the produce. The success of this business lies in the endorsement of our project by the king and the community. Our end goal is to industrialise uMsinga through farming and to eventually also introduce solar farms so that the local people can get discounted electricity and that the entire area goes green by using solar electricity. The solar power initiative is bound to work because of the layout of the area and the fact that there is sun all year round which can get to 45 degrees celcius. This abundance in solar exposure can be used for the further advancement of the people in Tugela Ferry. But for now we are focusing on agricultural farming.</p><p><i>The problems with the current farming system</i></p><p>Tugela ferry has a sizeable portion of arable land which lies along the Tugela ferry river bed. This land is owned by numerous individuals who each own on average 5 beds. These beds are farmed and have been farmed for generations. But the problem is that the produce produced by a single farmer using their beds is too small to make an impact on the wider economy and to sustain the farmer and their family in the long run. Another problem is that the produce which grows well on the land is always farmed the same way and the same produce is seen on the markets. There is essentially no system of competition law and there is an inadequate amount of business education for these farmers to be more successful and have a greater impact on the local and provincial economy.</p><p><i>Our team’s strengths </i></p><p>The founder of the company and project is armed with a working knowledge of the people and the culture. She is flanked by mature savvy local business owners, who are born in the area and have built their success in the area and from working the soil, as well as a team of enthusiastic and passionate young people. This coupled with the fact that the managing director is a local person, with an outstanding University education and a keen sensitivity to the social disposition of the people, Hope Legacies is confident that it will succeed in industrialising the uMsinga area through farming. </p><p><i>The grand plan</i></p><p>Hope Legacies will collect the individual beds of the small farmers and turn them into one huge farm hereby transforming the farming culture of the area from single farmer subsistence farming, to a team of farmers joined as one under our company to become one huge commercial entity. </p><p>The Msinga area has been known for many bad things such as tribal wars, faction fights, taxi wars and as the second poorest if not the poorest area in South Africa. It is also the area with the most HIV/AIDS infected people per square meter in the whole world. On top of that, the area has had to deal with fatal viral epidemics such as multi-drug resistant TB which claimed a large number of young people in the area. These sorts of statistics certainly do not inspire investor confidence, but a different way of looking at these statistics, is that by investing in this area, through our company, there is guaranteed success because of our above mentioned strengths. The success in industrialising the Msinga region will give hope to all the other rural areas of South Africa which Hope Legacies hopes to target once we complete the Msinga area. Once we succeed in our pilot area, we will be guaranteed success in the other rural areas of South Africa by implementing the same idea of industrialisation but tweaking the idea to personalise the project to suit the rural area in questions culture, social disposition and values. </p><p><i>Our produce</i></p><p>Our team has elected to launch the project with planting vegetables that we already know grow well in the area such as but not limited to corn, potatoes and tomatoes. Our niche is that we will plant a variety of these vegetables for example in the form of baby vegetables.</p><p><i>The ultimate end goal</i></p><p>It is evident from the above that our initial target group is small and only focusing on the Msinga area, but when the Msinga area rural industrialisation project works, the produce we harvest will be enough to supply the whole Msinga area and indeed eventually the whole province, hereby making a bigger economic impact, which will ultimately have a ripple effect to the economy of the country. Hope Legacies seeks to identify and enhance the strengths of the Msinga area’s farming methods and exploit that to the people’s advantage. </p><p>The success of this project in Msinga will mean that rural areas will be able to be self-sustaining, economically stable and be able to secure better education.</p><p><i>The benefits of the project</i></p><p>More job opportunities, education and industrialisation of rural areas will mean that less people will feel the need to move to urban areas for work, as they will have plenty of work in their joined farm project. The farming project will give everyone a sense of collective ownership and pride which we hope translates to collective responsibility. This assumption is premised on the customary law system which the Msinga area lives by. The idea is essentially that collective ownership and responsibility is the way of our forefathers and is a way for us as a community to succeed together. This kind of project is not tried and tested in farming but it is tried and tested in other ways such as the concept of stokvel and African artists coming together to exchange ideas and to sell their designs. Stokvel and art projects have enjoyed a huge degree of success and have been expanded to other rural areas and urban areas due to their success. The idea of stokvel is that people create a group which contributes a certain amount of money every month into the collective purse for an agreed upon period, after which they split the proceeds equally between all the group members in the form of either food packages, meat parcels or even money. By uniting people under a common cause and encouraging them to work together in the achievement of a single goal, you automatically encourage them to put away any small differences they might have between each other and to work for a bigger purpose which is for the betterment of their and their children's future.</p><p><strong><u>A little about our amazing team</u></strong></p><p>The people who are involved in the project are young people of all races, nationalities (South Africans, German, Dutch, Belgian) and backgrounds. But more importantly they are young, energetic, creative and passionate individuals who wish to assist in the ushering in of the new era of economic empowerment for all South Africans, the primary focus being on rural areas.</p><p><i>A little about the managing director</i></p><p>As stated above I (Nokulunga aka Lungie), founder and managing director of Spes legacies (also known as  Hope Legacies was born and raised in Tugela Ferry. I was orphaned at the age of 2 and my mother was sent to prison. I was taken in by my aunt, a domestic worker and a local doctor whom I came to know as my father. She fostered me and put me through school with the help of the doctor and when I finished school I went to the University of Cape Town where I went on to complete two degrees. The first degree is a social sciences degree, majoring in sociology, politics and social anthropology and the second was a Bachelor of law degree (LLB). I'm currently enrolled in a Masters in Public Law degree at the University of Cape Town.  I have just finished my University undergraduate education in 2015, through the help of University of Cape Town bursaries and government funding and I have now started on my Masters degree.</p><p><i>Our weaknesses and how we addressing them</i></p><p>It goes without saying that we do not all have practical experience of farming and industrialisation. I have an excellent theoretical knowledge of industrialisation and the law as well as how to run a business, as I have been successfully running a small property development business while I was studying, in order to help me fund my studies. To compensate for the lack of experience in the area of farming, I have surrounded myself with individuals who have invaluable proven experience in the area of farming as well as people who share a common vision and goal with me for poverty alleviation and economic empowerment. In a world where it is undeniable that as a black person I am a victim of extreme inequality and of our current society, I recognise my victimhood, but I also recognise that I am an empowered victim, because not only did I survive the bad hand dealt to me by life and society but I learnt a lot from my experiences and I have thrived in the midst of many pitfalls. I have experienced the hardships of life but through optimism, endless tears and finally hope, I emerged a stronger individual. Knowing the difficulties I faced and the inequality I have suffered, I refuse to be pitied by others as a victim because this disempowers me. Instead I use my acknowledgement of victimhood as an empowering tool, and with that in mind I plot my own way, carve my own destiny, knowing however difficult life was or  is right now, I have all I could ever want in order to be successful; optimism, faith in our people and country, hope for a better future for all of us and most of all I have confidence in myself, my team and in this project and the positive impact that it will make in our target area and eventually nationally.</p><p>I am working with ten incredible young individuals (Thembelihle Mntungwa, Sfundo Jali, Benedict Strohhaecker, Brooks Hugbo, Jacobus Coetzee, David Keyser, Celine Merle, Christine Moody,  Abhijit Kumar Nath and Lotte van Heesewijk). Their education and skills range from land negotiation, space engineering, farming abroad and locally, marketing and sales to farming degrees, accounting degrees, chartered accountants, arts degrees, business management and economics and legal knowledge. We are also blessed to have two amazing mentors and project advisors (Mr Mabaso, a local born businessman and a person who knows the culture and the people,and a seasoned farmer and rural development enthusiast; Mr Errol Keyser) who together have over 50 years of experience in farming, entrepreneurship and business management. Their knowledge and their experience is invaluable in this entire process and indeed in the successful implementation and execution of the project.</p><p>So in conclusion, please help us to raise as much as possible, not only in money, but other resources too, such as farming equipment, human resource capital in the form of ideas from experienced individuals in relevant areas of our project (irrigation specialists, farmers, marketers, sales people, investors, buyers of vegetables produce, volunteers, market researchers, industrial engineers, builders etc) who want to help out. So spread the word, excite as many people as possible about our project and make some noise, lets bring industrialisation through farming home so the unification of small farmers can make a bigger economic impact for the advancement of all.</p><p> </p><p> </p></div>","What do we need funding forWe are currently applying for a grant from the South African government under the  Land Redistribution for Agricultural Development (LRAD) programme.

On top of that, the area has had to deal with fatal viral epidemics such as multi-drug resistant TB which claimed a large number of young people in the area. These sorts of statistics certainly do not inspire investor confidence, but a different way of looking at these statistics, is that by investing in this area, through our company, there is guaranteed success because of our above mentioned strengths. The success in industrialising the Msinga region will give hope to all the other rural areas of South Africa which Hope Legacies hopes to target once we complete the Msinga area. Once we succeed in our pilot area, we will be guaranteed success in the other rural areas of South Africa by implementing the same idea of industrialisation but tweaking the idea to personalise the project to suit the rural area in questions culture, social disposition and values. Our produceOur team has elected to launch the project with planting vegetables that we already know grow well in the area such as but not limited to corn, potatoes and tomatoes. Our niche is that we will plant a variety of these vegetables for example in the form of baby vegetables.The ultimate end goalIt is evident from the above that our initial target group is small and only focusing on the Msinga area, but when the Msinga area rural industrialisation project works, the produce we harvest will be enough to supply the whole Msinga area and indeed eventually the whole province, hereby making a bigger economic impact, which will ultimately have a ripple effect to the economy of the country. Hope Legacies seeks to identify and enhance the strengths of the Msinga area’s farming methods and exploit that to the people’s advantage. The success of this project in Msinga will mean that rural areas will be able to be self-sustaining, economically stable and be able to secure better education.The benefits of the projectMore job opportunities, education and industrialisation of rural areas will mean that less people will feel the need to move to urban areas for work, as they will have plenty of work in their joined farm project. The farming project will give everyone a sense of collective ownership and pride which we hope translates to collective responsibility. This assumption is premised on the customary law system which the Msinga area lives by. The idea is essentially that collective ownership and responsibility is the way of our forefathers and is a way for us as a community to succeed together. This kind of project is not tried and tested in farming but it is tried and tested in other ways such as the concept of stokvel and African artists coming together to exchange ideas and to sell their designs. Stokvel and art projects have enjoyed a huge degree of success and have been expanded to other rural areas and urban areas due to their success. The idea of stokvel is that people create a group which contributes a certain amount of money every month into the collective purse for an agreed upon period, after which they split the proceeds equally between all the group members in the form of either food packages, meat parcels or even money. By uniting people under a common cause and encouraging them to work together in the achievement of a single goal, you automatically encourage them to put away any small differences they might have between each other and to work for a bigger purpose which is for the betterment of their and their children's future.A little about our amazing teamThe people who are involved in the project are young people of all races, nationalities (South Africans, German, Dutch, Belgian) and backgrounds. But more importantly they are young, energetic, creative and passionate individuals who wish to assist in the ushering in of the new era of economic empowerment for all South Africans, the primary focus being on rural areas.A little about the managing directorAs stated above I (Nokulunga aka Lungie), founder and managing director of Spes legacies (also known as  Hope Legacies was born and raised in Tugela Ferry. I was orphaned at the age of 2 and my mother was sent to prison. I was taken in by my aunt, a domestic worker and a local doctor whom I came to know as my father. She fostered me and put me through school with the help of the doctor and when I finished school I went to the University of Cape Town where I went on to complete two degrees. The first degree is a social sciences degree, majoring in sociology, politics and social anthropology and the second was a Bachelor of law degree (LLB). I'm currently enrolled in a Masters in Public Law degree at the University of Cape Town.  I have just finished my University undergraduate education in 2015, through the help of University of Cape Town bursaries and government funding and I have now started on my Masters degree.Our weaknesses and how we addressing themIt goes without saying that we do not all have practical experience of farming and industrialisation. I have an excellent theoretical knowledge of industrialisation and the law as well as how to run a business, as I have been successfully running a small property development business while I was studying, in order to help me fund my studies. To compensate for the lack of experience in the area of farming, I have surrounded myself with individuals who have invaluable proven experience in the area of farming as well as people who share a common vision and goal with me for poverty alleviation and economic empowerment. In a world where it is undeniable that as a black person I am a victim of extreme inequality and of our current society, I recognise my victimhood, but I also recognise that I am an empowered victim, because not only did I survive the bad hand dealt to me by life and society but I learnt a lot from my experiences and I have thrived in the midst of many pitfalls. I have experienced the hardships of life but through optimism, endless tears and finally hope, I emerged a stronger individual. Knowing the difficulties I faced and the inequality I have suffered, I refuse to be pitied by others as a victim because this disempowers me. Instead I use my acknowledgement of victimhood as an empowering tool, and with that in mind I plot my own way, carve my own destiny, knowing however difficult life was or  is right now, I have all I could ever want in order to be successful; optimism, faith in our people and country, hope for a better future for all of us and most of all I have confidence in myself, my team and in this project and the positive impact that it will make in our target area and eventually nationally.I am working with ten incredible young individuals (Thembelihle Mntungwa, Sfundo Jali, Benedict Strohhaecker, Brooks Hugbo, Jacobus Coetzee, David Keyser, Celine Merle, Christine Moody,  Abhijit Kumar Nath and Lotte van Heesewijk). Their education and skills range from land negotiation, space engineering, farming abroad and locally, marketing and sales to farming degrees, accounting degrees, chartered accountants, arts degrees, business management and economics and legal knowledge. We are also blessed to have two amazing mentors and project advisors (Mr Mabaso, a local born businessman and a person who knows the culture and the people,and a seasoned farmer and rural development enthusiast; Mr Errol Keyser) who together have over 50 years of experience in farming, entrepreneurship and business management. Their knowledge and their experience is invaluable in this entire process and indeed in the successful implementation and execution of the project.So in conclusion, please help us to raise as much as possible, not only in money, but other resources too, such as farming equipment, human resource capital in the form of ideas from experienced individuals in relevant areas of our project (irrigation specialists, farmers, marketers, sales people, investors, buyers of vegetables produce, volunteers, market researchers, industrial engineers, builders etc) who want to help out. So spread the word, excite as many people as possible about our project and make some noise, lets bring industrialisation through farming home so the unification of small farmers can make a bigger economic impact for the advancement of all.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Sewing and crafting are two of my great passions.  I love creating new things, especially clothing.  For years I have wanted to monetize my talent for sewing and turn it into a source of income, but have been unable to do so.  After conducting some research into new sources for materials such as fabric and tools, as well as practicing some new, more efficient techniques, I've determined that it would be feasible for me to finally take a crack at my dream of selling my crafts for a living.</p>
<p>Let me be clear, this isn't intended as a hobby business or anything like that. My goal is to use my skills to generate enough income so that I can afford my own groceries, medications, clothes, rent, and other living expenses.  My goal is for this business to be my livelihood.</p>
<p>The problem now is start-up capital.  So I thought hey, why not reach out to my amazingly supportive friends and family members and the world at large and see if they would be interested in some cool stuff in exchange for helping me start this business.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need start-up capital to acquire materials, tools, and other resources that are necessary to create the products that my business will sell.  I'm doing absolutely everything I can think of to keep the goal for this campaign from getting TOO high, including raiding my personal fabric supply, thrifting, and offering up parts of my personal stash to other craftspeople for materials trades.  But I still need help.</p>
<p>And I want to make sure that I adequately thank those who are able to help.  The backer rewards for this campaign include everything from stickers featuring the logo artwork by amazing artist Celiedh Chance, handmade skirts, beaded necklaces, and tie dye bandanas using up to two colors of your choosing created by yours truly, and even hand-crochet platyfly plushies created in collusion with local crochet goddess Anjala Dick.</p>
<div>
<h3>A Rough Breakdown of the Costs</h3>
<p>Here is a breakdown of as many things that I could think of that I would need to get this business started.  It's everything from materials for making my stock to getting my sewing machines serviced to storage for both my supplies and my finished pieces.  I've put a lot of effort into digging through the internet to find the best deals that I could on the items I picked out.  Here's what your contribution to this campaign would enable me to acquire and accomplish:</p>
<ul>
<li>$343.12 (plus shipping fees) – Fabrics and other materials for a base stock of almost 60 items</li>
<li>$235.82 (plus shipping fees) – Packaging materials to present a professional, polished impression to my customers</li>
<li>$220.69 (plus shipping fees) – Tools and servicing for my sewing machines</li>
<li>$182.95 – A photo table to take photos of my smaller stock items, such as jewelry</li>
<li>$200.00 – The adorable logo artwork created by artist Celiedh Chance</li>
<li>$95.97 (plus shipping fees) – Storage for completed stock</li>
<li>$413.30 (plus shipping fees) – Storage for fabric, tools, and other items associated with this business</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional funds raised by this campaign that are not listed here will go to things like paying a photographer so that I can have quality product photos of my larger stock items and the backer reward creation and shipping.</p>
</div>
</div><div>
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p><strong>$2,800.00</strong></p>
<p>If I can raise an extra $300.00, I can purchase a new serger.  My current serger is good for basic work, but I would like to have a more advanced machine to enable me to use more advanced techniques.  My current serger also came to me second-hand and underwent heavy use prior to coming into my possession.  Thus, if I'm able to purchase a more modern, more advanced serger, that would be very useful to my business endeavors.</p>
<p>If I reach my stretch goal, backers of ALL levels will receive a handmade drawstring pouch—some color customization is possible, and they make GREAT dice bags—with a miniature platypus pewter figurine lovingly tucked inside.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution to this campaign gives me a shot at financial independence.  Income is something that all of us need in order to buy groceries, pay for medications, purchase clothing and shoes, and fulfill other less basic needs like going to the movies or buying birthday gifts for our loved ones.  To be candid, there are a lot of factors that make it difficult for me to pursue non-entrepreneurial employment, not the least of which is a diagnosed anxiety disorder.  Opening my own Etsy store will enable me to earn a living while working in an environment that is less wearing on that anxiety disorder.  But I can't do it without you.</p>
<h3>Here's How It Works</h3>
<p>In case you haven't crowdfunded anything before, or in case you're not familiar with Indiegogo, here's how this works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Peruse the reward levels to the right and choose the one that best suits you</li>
<li>Click the ""Back It"" button at the top of the page</li>
<li>You can either use PayPal or your own credit card to back my campaign—the benefit of using your credit card is that a smaller fee is incurred than if you use PayPal, but if you're not comfortable entering your credit card info online, then go for PayPal!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong></p>
<p>Please give me a reliable way to get in contact with you so that I can get your input on material choices if necessary and so that I can get your goodies to you! I have no way to get your backer rewards to you if I have no way to contact you.</p>
<ul>
<li>The campaign will either be fully funded, or it will be partially funded.  Either way, I'll still receive some funds to start my business.  Still, I am REALLY hoping that this campaign will be fully funded, otherwise I'll have to figure out how to juggle some things unless and until the business makes enough money for me to afford the things that I wasn't able to acquire through this campaign.</li>
<li>The funds raised by this campaign are transferred to my personal bank account</li>
<li>I use the funds for the aforementioned supplies and services</li>
<li>I begin crafting like a madwoman, working on store stock and backer rewards alike</li>
</ul>
<ul><li>I get to launch my Etsy store and you get your swag</li></ul>
</div><div>

<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<h3>Regarding Bandana Color Choices</h3>

Let me be clear, this isn't intended as a hobby business or anything like that. My goal is to use my skills to generate enough income so that I can afford my own groceries, medications, clothes, rent, and other living expenses.  My goal is for this business to be my livelihood.
The problem now is start-up capital.  So I thought hey, why not reach out to my amazingly supportive friends and family members and the world at large and see if they would be interested in some cool stuff in exchange for helping me start this business.

What I Need & What You Get
I need start-up capital to acquire materials, tools, and other resources that are necessary to create the products that my business will sell.  I'm doing absolutely everything I can think of to keep the goal for this campaign from getting TOO high, including raiding my personal fabric supply, thrifting, and offering up parts of my personal stash to other craftspeople for materials trades.  But I still need help.
And I want to make sure that I adequately thank those who are able to help.  The backer rewards for this campaign include everything from stickers featuring the logo artwork by amazing artist Celiedh Chance, handmade skirts, beaded necklaces, and tie dye bandanas using up to two colors of your choosing created by yours truly, and even hand-crochet platyfly plushies created in collusion with local crochet goddess Anjala Dick.

A Rough Breakdown of the Costs
Here is a breakdown of as many things that I could think of that I would need to get this business started.  It's everything from materials for making my stock to getting my sewing machines serviced to storage for both my supplies and my finished pieces.  I've put a lot of effort into digging through the internet to find the best deals that I could on the items I picked out.  Here's what your contribution to this campaign would enable me to acquire and accomplish:

$343.12 (plus shipping fees) – Fabrics and other materials for a base stock of almost 60 items
$235.82 (plus shipping fees) – Packaging materials to present a professional, polished impression to my customers
$220.69 (plus shipping fees) – Tools and servicing for my sewing machines
$182.95 – A photo table to take photos of my smaller stock items, such as jewelry
$200.00 – The adorable logo artwork created by artist Celiedh Chance
$95.97 (plus shipping fees) – Storage for completed stock
$413.30 (plus shipping fees) – Storage for fabric, tools, and other items associated with this business

Additional funds raised by this campaign that are not listed here will go to things like paying a photographer so that I can have quality product photos of my larger stock items and the backer reward creation and shipping.


Stretch Goals
$2,800.00
If I can raise an extra $300.00, I can purchase a new serger.  My current serger is good for basic work, but I would like to have a more advanced machine to enable me to use more advanced techniques.  My current serger also came to me second-hand and underwent heavy use prior to coming into my possession.  Thus, if I'm able to purchase a more modern, more advanced serger, that would be very useful to my business endeavors.
If I reach my stretch goal, backers of ALL levels will receive a handmade drawstring pouch—some color customization is possible, and they make GREAT dice bags—with a miniature platypus pewter figurine lovingly tucked inside.

Your Impact
Your contribution to this campaign gives me a shot at financial independence.  Income is something that all of us need in order to buy groceries, pay for medications, purchase clothing and shoes, and fulfill other less basic needs like going to the movies or buying birthday gifts for our loved ones.  To be candid, there are a lot of factors that make it difficult for me to pursue non-entrepreneurial employment, not the least of which is a diagnosed anxiety disorder.  Opening my own Etsy store will enable me to earn a living while working in an environment that is less wearing on that anxiety disorder.  But I can't do it without you.

The campaign will either be fully funded, or it will be partially funded.  Either way, I'll still receive some funds to start my business.  Still, I am REALLY hoping that this campaign will be fully funded, otherwise I'll have to figure out how to juggle some things unless and until the business makes enough money for me to afford the things that I wasn't able to acquire through this campaign.
The funds raised by this campaign are transferred to my personal bank account
I use the funds for the aforementioned supplies and services
I begin crafting like a madwoman, working on store stock and backer rewards alike

I get to launch my Etsy store and you get your swag

Regarding Bandana Color Choices
Right, well, the dye kit I'm looking at doesn't have the colors listed online, and Google is being no help.  However, you can probably safely count on at least black, and the standard rainbow—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, and violet.  I'll send out a message to the recipients of this reward item once I have the kit in hand to let everyone know the full spectrum of the available colors and folks can let me know which two they want.

<h3><strong>A Passion For Community and Craft Beer</strong></h3>
<p>After nearly five years of careful research and planning, we have secured the perfect building in scenic downtown Cannon Falls, MN, purchased all of our brewing equipment, and are getting ready to fulfill our dream of opening a community gathering place where people can enjoy locally made craft beer.  We believe that beer used to be at the center of community, bringing people together to laugh, love, share conversation, and maybe even solve a problem or two, and we want to be a part of that process.  We want to share both our passion and our beer with you!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We brew fresh, handcrafted, artisanal beers made with locally sourced ingredients whenever possible.  We take the idea of craft beer so seriously at <a href=""http://tilionbrewing.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tilion Brewing Company</a>, that our name is taken from the Icelandic word “Til iðn” (pronounced Til-lee-thon), which literally translates into “To Craft"".  We celebrate those who share a passion for making things with their own hands.  We will support the local maker community by hosting events and inviting local artisans and craftsmen (artists, sculptors, cheese makers, etc) to our brewery to share their passions as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While we are not a military themed brewery, we feel strongly that the men and women who have served our country matter!  We come from military families who have had grandfathers, fathers, brothers, and sister-in-laws who have served during war, including one of Tilion’s own co-founders, Sgt. Scott Larson, who served in Afghanistan.  To honor our veterans, we will be donating a portion of sales from our ""Roger, Roger"" pale ale (named after one of our fathers who served in Vietnam) to the families of Minnesota veterans that have served overseas.</p>

<h3><strong>Why Crowdfunding?</strong></h3>
<p>As you can probably tell, building community is very important to us and we would like to invite you to join our founding family.  Select a perk (or three) and be with us from day one, possibly getting your name on the ""Founder's Wall"" in our taproom.</p>

<p>Our goal of $30,000 will allow us to put the finishing touches on an amazing taproom.  These funds will be used to build our bar and furnish the taproom with tables, chairs, stools, and fixtures.  Opening Cannon Falls' first brewery and taproom is no small feat, but we will make it happen with your help!</p>

I'm a creative writer and a barista who has always dreamed of travel writing. Whenever I travel, I always feel creatively refreshed: I gain so many new perspectives and ideas, I have new things to share with others, and I have so many interesting new stories! I love adventure, exploration, meeting new people, and trying new things. I hope to travel as many places as I can, and then bring the joy and adventure back to Let's Grab Coffee and Moonbeam Cafe.</p><p><br/>By contributing to this fundraiser, you will help to support this dream, and an awesome adventure! And more concretely, you will be helping to provide Let's Grab Coffee, and other communities that I lead, with a wealth of original, fresh, fun, exciting new content: including podcasts, interviews, photographs, stories, and more. This campaign's <strong>fundraising is flexible</strong>, so even if it doesn't meet the entire goal, I will still be able to do some traveling!</p><p> </p><p>Below, I'll outline the trips that I've come up with. Remember, they don't all need to be achieved. Even a couple trips will still provide great content and lots of fun! At the top of the list are smaller, regional trips, which will be easier to achieve on a tighter budget. At the end of the list, I outline harder to reach trips that would be ideal to take if the entire goal is met.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Lower budget trip possibilities:</strong></p><p> </p><p><b>The Windy City!</b>- A road trip to Chicago. It'd be wonderful to explore Navy Pier, the Bean, and take a tour of the city. I could also sample some great Chicago coffee shops, meet any Imzynauts in the area, and perhaps check out a theater show! With a friend in the area I can stay with, the cost for this trip is fairly low. <i>Estimated cost: $200.</i> </p><p><br/><strong>New Year's in New York City! </strong>- Earlier in the year, some Imzynauts and I discussed how it'd be wonderful to share the New Year celebration together. It'd be even more awesome if I could report on the ball drop and celebration live from Times Square, NYC! I would also love to meet Imzynauts in the NYC area, see some iconic sights, and try some tasty coffee shops! With a family member in the area to stay with, I can keep the cost for this trip fairly low. <i>Estimated cost: $300.</i></p><p><br/><strong>Cape May, New Jersey, in the winter! </strong>- In the off season, this Victorian Beach Resort is starkly beautiful. There is snow on the beach, and you can stand alone and watch the vast ocean. I love being on the beach in the winter! Cape May is a gorgeous town with tons of history. I've been here before, but I'd love to go back specifically for creating Imzy content! Each old Victorian mansion has its own quirky story. There are even some haunted houses! Being near the ocean always puts me in the mood for poetry, so I'm looking forward to some perfect creative writing time and some lovely poems to share with my communities when I return! I'll have to get an Air B and B for this trip, but in the off season, they can be relatively inexpensive. <i>Estimated cost: $500.</i></p><p><br/><strong>Disney World for Thanksgiving</strong>- I'm already going to Disney World, Florida, in November! My park ticket and hotel have already been covered for this trip, but I still need to pay for my plane ticket. I would love to create some fun content for Imzy while I'm here! I hope to make some wonderful videos to capture the magic and excitement of Disney. I'm really looking forward to this trip, and all the stories I can bring back. I'd love to share the fun by sending postcards from Disney! <i>Estimated cost: $300</i>.</p><p><br/><strong>Houston, Texas</strong> - There are a lot of interesting things to see in Houston, and if I go in the fall, I can dress up and attend one of the largest Renaissance Fairs in the country! There are also some wonderful restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and museums. I'm sure there are some Imzynauts to meet here, too! With a family member in the area, I won't have to pay for a hotel. <i>Estimated cost: $350.</i></p><p><br/><strong>Medium budget trip possibilities:</strong></p><p><br/><strong>Road trip to New Orleans!</strong> - I've always wanted to see this city. I could road trip to New Orleans, perhaps sometime in the spring, to check out its amazing food, coffee, architecture, history, and more! This trip could be perfect for Moonbeam Cafe! New Orleans seems like such a fun and interesting place. <i>Estimated cost: $500</i></p><p> </p><p><strong>Higher budget trip possibilities, if entire goal is met:</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Imzy Headquarters! </strong>- I will travel to Salt Lake City, Utah, to tour Imzy Headquarters and meet all the awesome people who make Imzy possible! We can do live interviews, an office tour, live-stream a very silly game, and hear more about how Imzy came to be and how it has evolved. Outside of Imzy, I would explore local coffee shops and roasters for Let's Grab Coffee, and local breweries for Moonbeam Cafe! We've also heard that there are dinosaur bones in Utah! A fun activity for this trip could be checking out a dinosaur museum or other dinosaur attractions! (We call this section of the trip ""The Hunt for the Original Imzysaurus"".) <i>Estimated cost: $1,000</i></p><p> </p><p><strong>The Ultimate Podcast Meetup! </strong>- I will fly to meet Lizzie in Canada, and spend quality time recording our BaristaBitches Podcast in real life. I have never been out of the United States, so it will also be fun to check out this part of Canada and share some hilarious adventures. The most exciting part, however, will be the ability to have great conversations with Lizzie in the real world, come up with awesome new podcast content, and record podcast conversations, adventures, and more together! We also plan to record some of our adventures on video, for even more fun (and probably absurd) Let's Grab Coffee, Moonbeam Cafe and BaristaBitches content! I'm super thrilled about this trip. I believe it will speed the BaristaBitches Podcast on its way to becoming even more entertaining and creative! <i>Estimated cost: $1,500</i></p><p> </p><p><strong>Coffee Paradise!</strong> I will visit Portland, Oregon - the coffee capitol of the USA! I know there are some Imzynauts in this area. I'll spend time grabbing coffee in the real world. But mostly, this trip will be a caffeinated extravaganza. I'll explore as many coffeehouses as possible, taking photos, doing interviews, trying roasts, and gathering all sorts of good stories to share with Let's Grab Coffee on Imzy! <i>Estimated cost: $1,000.</i></p><p> </p><p><strong>Bonus Equipment Upgrade: </strong>Better Podcast Microphones! Lizzie and I have had some difficulties in recording the podcast on unprofessional microphones.

You know me as @Eilis, the founder and main barista of Let's Grab Coffee on Imzy! I'm a creative writer and a barista who has always dreamed of travel writing. Whenever I travel, I always feel creatively refreshed: I gain so many new perspectives and ideas, I have new things to share with others, and I have so many interesting new stories! I love adventure, exploration, meeting new people, and trying new things. I hope to travel as many places as I can, and then bring the joy and adventure back to Let's Grab Coffee and Moonbeam Cafe.By contributing to this fundraiser, you will help to support this dream, and an awesome adventure! And more concretely, you will be helping to provide Let's Grab Coffee, and other communities that I lead, with a wealth of original, fresh, fun, exciting new content: including podcasts, interviews, photographs, stories, and more. This campaign's fundraising is flexible, so even if it doesn't meet the entire goal, I will still be able to do some traveling! Below, I'll outline the trips that I've come up with. Remember, they don't all need to be achieved. Even a couple trips will still provide great content and lots of fun! At the top of the list are smaller, regional trips, which will be easier to achieve on a tighter budget. At the end of the list, I outline harder to reach trips that would be ideal to take if the entire goal is met. Lower budget trip possibilities: The Windy City!- A road trip to Chicago. It'd be wonderful to explore Navy Pier, the Bean, and take a tour of the city. I could also sample some great Chicago coffee shops, meet any Imzynauts in the area, and perhaps check out a theater show! With a friend in the area I can stay with, the cost for this trip is fairly low. Estimated cost: $200. New Year's in New York City! - Earlier in the year, some Imzynauts and I discussed how it'd be wonderful to share the New Year celebration together. It'd be even more awesome if I could report on the ball drop and celebration live from Times Square, NYC! I would also love to meet Imzynauts in the NYC area, see some iconic sights, and try some tasty coffee shops! With a family member in the area to stay with, I can keep the cost for this trip fairly low. Estimated cost: $300.Cape May, New Jersey, in the winter! - In the off season, this Victorian Beach Resort is starkly beautiful. There is snow on the beach, and you can stand alone and watch the vast ocean. I love being on the beach in the winter! Cape May is a gorgeous town with tons of history. I've been here before, but I'd love to go back specifically for creating Imzy content! Each old Victorian mansion has its own quirky story. There are even some haunted houses! Being near the ocean always puts me in the mood for poetry, so I'm looking forward to some perfect creative writing time and some lovely poems to share with my communities when I return! I'll have to get an Air B and B for this trip, but in the off season, they can be relatively inexpensive. Estimated cost: $500.Disney World for Thanksgiving- I'm already going to Disney World, Florida, in November! My park ticket and hotel have already been covered for this trip, but I still need to pay for my plane ticket. I would love to create some fun content for Imzy while I'm here! I hope to make some wonderful videos to capture the magic and excitement of Disney. I'm really looking forward to this trip, and all the stories I can bring back. I'd love to share the fun by sending postcards from Disney! Estimated cost: $300.Houston, Texas - There are a lot of interesting things to see in Houston, and if I go in the fall, I can dress up and attend one of the largest Renaissance Fairs in the country! There are also some wonderful restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and museums. I'm sure there are some Imzynauts to meet here, too! With a family member in the area, I won't have to pay for a hotel. Estimated cost: $350.Medium budget trip possibilities:Road trip to New Orleans! - I've always wanted to see this city. I could road trip to New Orleans, perhaps sometime in the spring, to check out its amazing food, coffee, architecture, history, and more! This trip could be perfect for Moonbeam Cafe! New Orleans seems like such a fun and interesting place. Estimated cost: $500 Higher budget trip possibilities, if entire goal is met: Imzy Headquarters! - I will travel to Salt Lake City, Utah, to tour Imzy Headquarters and meet all the awesome people who make Imzy possible! We can do live interviews, an office tour, live-stream a very silly game, and hear more about how Imzy came to be and how it has evolved. Outside of Imzy, I would explore local coffee shops and roasters for Let's Grab Coffee, and local breweries for Moonbeam Cafe! We've also heard that there are dinosaur bones in Utah! A fun activity for this trip could be checking out a dinosaur museum or other dinosaur attractions! (We call this section of the trip ""The Hunt for the Original Imzysaurus"".) Estimated cost: $1,000 The Ultimate Podcast Meetup! - I will fly to meet Lizzie in Canada, and spend quality time recording our BaristaBitches Podcast in real life. I have never been out of the United States, so it will also be fun to check out this part of Canada and share some hilarious adventures. The most exciting part, however, will be the ability to have great conversations with Lizzie in the real world, come up with awesome new podcast content, and record podcast conversations, adventures, and more together! We also plan to record some of our adventures on video, for even more fun (and probably absurd) Let's Grab Coffee, Moonbeam Cafe and BaristaBitches content! I'm super thrilled about this trip. I believe it will speed the BaristaBitches Podcast on its way to becoming even more entertaining and creative! Estimated cost: $1,500 Coffee Paradise! I will visit Portland, Oregon - the coffee capitol of the USA! I know there are some Imzynauts in this area. I'll spend time grabbing coffee in the real world. But mostly, this trip will be a caffeinated extravaganza. I'll explore as many coffeehouses as possible, taking photos, doing interviews, trying roasts, and gathering all sorts of good stories to share with Let's Grab Coffee on Imzy! Estimated cost: $1,000. Bonus Equipment Upgrade: Better Podcast Microphones! Lizzie and I have had some difficulties in recording the podcast on unprofessional microphones. If we exceed our fundraising goal, we would love to be able to invest in a good microphone for both of us, in order to increase the quality of our podcast. We've been so thrilled that you have enjoyed the podcast so far, and we'd love to make it even better! We've researched microphones extensively and have found the Yeti to be an ideal candidate! Total cost: $300 Funds donated to this campaign will be used to pay for airfare, gas fare, any lodging needed, and food needed during the trips, as outlined above. If we exceed our goal, we will plan more fun content, and maybe even an additional trip! As mentioned previously, this campaign has a flexible fundraising goal - this means that I can still go on the Have Coffee, Will Travel adventure if we don't reach the entirety of the $5,000: it will just be less destinations overall, but still a ton of fun! Be sure to check out our unique perks, created just for this fundraising campaign. They range from shout-outs, to being featured on the podcast, to artwork, postcards, stickers, t-shirts, and more! We're really excited to be able to send awesome, fun perks to everyone who wants to contribute to our campaign. Just choose the donation level that is right for you, and the perk for that level that looks fun to you! Reaching the goal for the Have Coffee, Will Travel Podcast Adventure would be life-changing for me. Traveling to awesome places and meeting great people, and being able to share adventures with them, is a dream of mine. And bringing that sense of joy and adventure back to the wonderful members of Imzy will make it even more fulfilling and meaningful. I'm so excited to get this project started and see where it can take me. Thank you so very much for being interested in this project. I sincerely hope to one day stop by your hometown and share coffee, laughs, and adventures with you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Thanks for stopping by!</h3>
<p>We're so happy you dropped by our fundraising page and wanted to take a moment to share who we are and what we're trying to accomplish. </p>
<p>We here at <strong>EXCEL Therapy &amp; Conditioning</strong> are doing our best to bring to the town of Wilbraham and surrounding communities a one stop shop for health and wellness. We've incorporated Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Massage, a collegiate level weight room, one on one and small group/team training, strength and conditioning group exercise classes, and so much more! In our efforts to continue to provide everything you could want under one roof, we're endeavoring to bring Spin Classes to you. </p>
<p>It's been brought to our attention that there's a real desire to have locally accessible Spin classes with a phenomenal coach. Well, we have the coach, and now we need your help to get the equipment. But don't worry- we're not expecting something for nothing. You're helping us, <u>so let us help you</u>! After all, helping <i>YOU</i> is what <strong>EXCEL</strong> is all about.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Help Us to Help YOU</h3>
<p>Here's the deal folks, Spin bikes are EXPENSIVE, they require some capital that unfortunately this pandemic has all but eliminated for us. So that's where you come in, if we can reach or exceed our goal then we can purchase as many bikes as that will get us, and the best part is- all you've done is pay for your classes in advance! If we don't reach our goal, then we'll purchase whatever we can so we can still bring you quality classes, and we'll build as the popularity for the classes grows. But don't worry! Even as that happens and our popularity climbs, we will simply add in additional class times. We are committed to remaining a boutique style location for you, that means smaller classes allowing for real attention to growth and gains from our coaches. </p>
<p>You'll see that each Tier of Donating comes with a correlating number of classes and fun <strong>EXCEL</strong> swag, no matter which tier you choose to donate to, you are guaranteed to get your money's worth. We are committed to helping you achieve your goals, and are always happy to reward your loyalty to us!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Bigger Picture</h3>
<p>The fact of the matter is that people need to release some steam and they're looking for fun and effective ways to improve their mental, emotional, and physical well-being. AND WE'RE ALL ABOUT IT! But we're tired of having to pop around to dozens of different locations to find what we're looking for. Which is why we want to bring it to you under one roof. You guys have asked for Spin classes and told us that you're tired of traveling 30+ minutes away to other bigger box gyms, you want it local and personal, and we want to deliver that to you. By donating today you are not only investing in yourself by purchasing classes to move toward your own personal goals, but you're helping a local business stay afloat in a very scary economic time frame. We <i>want</i> to be there for you, and we are <u>honored</u> to have you be there for us.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know money is tight right now, and even if you want to help us out and invest in yourself- sometimes that's just not possible. We get it, trust us. But there's more you can do. You can share this page, write us a review, follow us on social media, give us a shout out or humble brag if you've benefitted from our services or awesome staff. Get the word out there for us so that more people can recognize what we're all about and come to aid as well. Every little bit helps!</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>We're excited to share information on <a href=""http://TheLabAlliance.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i><strong>The Lab Alliance</strong></i></a> with you, our uniquely designed commitment to economic acceleration for businesses, entrepreneurs, and under served/underrepresented communities powered by Qualified Opportunity Zones. </p>
<p>We have officially launched our flagship location, <a href=""http://TheLabOrlando.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i><strong>The Lab Orlando</strong></i></a>, in the historic Parramore District of the city with expansion plans for 200 ""Lab"" locations in opportunity zones throughout the US.</p>
<p>As we were preparing for the opening of The Lab Orlando, we came across something in our research so significant that we adjusted our model to ensure that we could make meaningful and long lasting contributions to the communities we serve, which we'll share later.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Need &amp; Our Perks</h3>
<p><strong>Funding Need: $25,000</strong></p>
<p>The $25,000 raise amount will allow us to accelerate the delivery of key resources, namely:</p>

<li><strong>Helping to create a future entity that empowers members of the community to invest in their future success.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Our perks include:</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599084291/nqyeqehamnzsgkl53ezw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i><strong>(a look at The Lab Orlando from the street. We have over 20 picture windows facing West Church Street in Orlando, between The Amway Arena, Orlando City Soccer, and Camping World Stadium. The Lab is located at 1016 West Church St. Suite B in Orlando, FL.)</strong></i></p>
<p>The Lab Alliance is a 501c6 membership association designed to empower the economic acceleration of businesses, entrepreneurs, non-profits, vision, and ideas via specially designed Federally Qualified Opportunity Zone ecosystems throughout the United States, by helping people to move their life mission forward with fellowship, opportunity, and community.</p>
<p>Qualified Opportunity Zones were originally created by the US Government in 2017, focused on economically under served communities and designed to assist with economic growth. Investors are incentivized to make investments into qualified opportunity zones with eligibility for preferential tax treatment and tax free capital gains. For entrepreneurs and businesses, the barriers to attracting investment resources are lowered as investors are able to take advantage of the tax benefits of investing in a qualified opportunity zone fund.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599084963/g51lwq871u8fstnoppur.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i><strong>(a view of The Lab Orlando, with the media studio entrance in the back left corner)</strong></i></p>
<p>The Lab Alliance also has a profound and direct impact on businesses, professionals, public servants, and under-represented communities within qualified opportunity zones through its commitment to socioeconomic progress for residents, empowering them to control the destiny and success of their lives, their families, and their communities.</p>
<p>The Lab Orlando is the flagship economic accelerator for The Lab Alliance, with a total of 200 locations planned in qualified opportunity zones throughout the United States.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599084318/iuzzuwdvtuwtgnafx1ds.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i><strong>(a panoramic view of The Inside of The Lab Orlando)</strong></i></p>
</div><div>
<p>In 2019, Julianna Ormond and RC Williams, entrepreneurial ecosystem builders and  co-founders of LiAison Labs heard the call  for a space where like-minded organizations and individuals could come together to connect, create, problem solve, and help the community as a whole, with their relationships and expertise.  </p>
<p>This location became a reality in March 2020 when space at 1016 W. Church Street in Orlando, FL was secured and The Lab Orlando was born.</p>
<p>As the Lab Alliance team prepared to ramp up operations, the Coronavirus pandemic took center stage. This event created a high level of uncertainty – and was <strong>100% proof</strong> that we need each other and that the Lab Alliance is necessary now. </p>
<p>As we come out of this phase and into our new normal, we asked really tough questions:</p>
<p><i><strong>How do we find balance as a community?</strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong>How do we find balance for our children? </strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong>How can we help with the intense economic and socio-economic challenges that are coming from this?</strong></i></p>
<p>The Lab Alliance is the answer.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>A Life Changing Discovery</h3>
<p>Our background research on the impact of socioeconomic status on under represented communities told us we needed to do more for the community where the lab is based. We commit time and resources to make space, education, and other resources available to members of the Parramore community to improve socioeconomic status.</p>

</div></div>","Overview

We're excited to share information on The Lab Alliance with you, our uniquely designed commitment to economic acceleration for businesses, entrepreneurs, and under served/underrepresented communities powered by Qualified Opportunity Zones. 
We have officially launched our flagship location, The Lab Orlando, in the historic Parramore District of the city with expansion plans for 200 ""Lab"" locations in opportunity zones throughout the US.
As we were preparing for the opening of The Lab Orlando, we came across something in our research so significant that we adjusted our model to ensure that we could make meaningful and long lasting contributions to the communities we serve, which we'll share later.
 

Our Need & Our Perks
Funding Need: $25,000
The $25,000 raise amount will allow us to accelerate the delivery of key resources, namely:

Business and financial education resources to entrepreneurs and businesses, including mentorship in preparation for creating jobs, building ownership, and sound business practices facilitating generational wealth;
Operating our ""community hub"" components for training, education, and resources to improve the socioeconomic status and empower the Parramore community to improve quality of life and control of activity by the community;
Creating an environment where sponsors, trustees, and other supporters are empowered to make a meaning difference in the places that it matter most;
Helping to create a future entity that empowers members of the community to invest in their future success.

Our perks include:

The ""iEmpower"" Lab Alliance t-shirts, showing your support for people powered communities that make meaningful change;
Recognition on our ""founding supporters"" window collage, which faces our heavily trafficked main street;
Our ""Under-served Communities Action Plan"" challenge coins; 
Recognition at Lab events;
Sponsorship of our media & podcast studio;

In the event we do not reach our goal, we will put the funds we raise to work and continue to move forward.
 

The Impact

(a look at The Lab Orlando from the street. We have over 20 picture windows facing West Church Street in Orlando, between The Amway Arena, Orlando City Soccer, and Camping World Stadium. The Lab is located at 1016 West Church St. Suite B in Orlando, FL.)
The Lab Alliance is a 501c6 membership association designed to empower the economic acceleration of businesses, entrepreneurs, non-profits, vision, and ideas via specially designed Federally Qualified Opportunity Zone ecosystems throughout the United States, by helping people to move their life mission forward with fellowship, opportunity, and community.
Qualified Opportunity Zones were originally created by the US Government in 2017, focused on economically under served communities and designed to assist with economic growth. Investors are incentivized to make investments into qualified opportunity zones with eligibility for preferential tax treatment and tax free capital gains. For entrepreneurs and businesses, the barriers to attracting investment resources are lowered as investors are able to take advantage of the tax benefits of investing in a qualified opportunity zone fund.
(a view of The Lab Orlando, with the media studio entrance in the back left corner)
The Lab Alliance also has a profound and direct impact on businesses, professionals, public servants, and under-represented communities within qualified opportunity zones through its commitment to socioeconomic progress for residents, empowering them to control the destiny and success of their lives, their families, and their communities.
The Lab Orlando is the flagship economic accelerator for The Lab Alliance, with a total of 200 locations planned in qualified opportunity zones throughout the United States.

(a panoramic view of The Inside of The Lab Orlando)

In 2019, Julianna Ormond and RC Williams, entrepreneurial ecosystem builders and  co-founders of LiAison Labs heard the call  for a space where like-minded organizations and individuals could come together to connect, create, problem solve, and help the community as a whole, with their relationships and expertise.  
This location became a reality in March 2020 when space at 1016 W. Church Street in Orlando, FL was secured and The Lab Orlando was born.
As the Lab Alliance team prepared to ramp up operations, the Coronavirus pandemic took center stage. This event created a high level of uncertainty – and was 100% proof that we need each other and that the Lab Alliance is necessary now. 
As we come out of this phase and into our new normal, we asked really tough questions:
How do we find balance as a community?
How do we find balance for our children? 
How can we help with the intense economic and socio-economic challenges that are coming from this?
The Lab Alliance is the answer.
 
A Life Changing Discovery
Our background research on the impact of socioeconomic status on under represented communities told us we needed to do more for the community where the lab is based. We commit time and resources to make space, education, and other resources available to members of the Parramore community to improve socioeconomic status.

 
Our Leadership & Expert Advisors
We've assembled a mix of community leadership, business leadership, and industry experts to assist us in growing the Lab Alliance model.
 



 
Future Plans
Our Under-Served Communities Action Plan (""UCAP"") represents an extension of our commitment, designed to accelerate meaningful, multi-generational socioeconomic progress.

<h2>SSB Respite Care is a soon to be respite care facility and school for children and young adults in Durham County, North Carolina.</h2>
<p>The Company’s founder, Theresa Bass, personally recognized the need for a respite care facility in the county after struggling to find the appropriate help for her granddaughter who has autism and found close to none. It took years for Theresa to get her granddaughter properly diagnosed and in front of the right health care professionals. After years of struggling to help her, the positive result of the right care made an immediate impact in both of their lives.</p>
<p>Currently, when children with developmental disabilities in Durham County experience severe episodes that are beyond the guardian's ability to manage, there is nowhere to take them for help. These episodes can place the caretaker and other family members at risk of injury and the child facing developmental difficulties can harm themselves. Since there are no other options for help, the guardian is currently forced to take the child to the emergency room and have them admitted to the hospital. Now, caregivers can utilize the services at SSB Respite Care and trust that their children will receive topnotch care from trained professionals that truly understand how to administer the right care for their unique needs. This level of care helps to avoid misdiagnosis and leads to a quicker, more constructive recovery. By educating and involving caregivers every step of the way, we help them minimize future episodes by recognizing triggers and learning new ways to approach care.</p>
<p>SSB Respite Care’s mission is to help children with developmental disabilities throughout Durham County with a better approach to care, providing peace of mind to caregivers and a better quality of life for children struggling with developmental delays. The Company will help children with all types of developmental disorders including ASD, PTSD, ADHD, Anger Management, Bipolar Disorder, and more. Often, these children suffer with a combination of disorders which complicates treatment and requires specialized services and ongoing behavioral support.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>The company will have the capacity to treat 20 clients in 20 private rooms. Each room will be homey and upscale helping each child truly feel at home. Unlike other facilities, the Company plans to incorporate aspects of each child’s day to day life to better implement healthy habits for when the child does return home. This means that the families and caretakers of the child will have an active role in the recovery and recuperation of the child. From delivering homework to the facility to taking the child to doctor’s appointments themselves the facility will focus on providing integration with the child’s regular day to day as much as possible.</p>
<p>To open its respite center, SSB is seeking $100,000 in start-up funding to be allocated towards the build-out of the location, initial marketing, key hires, and more.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please spread the word! Share our social media links and websites with your friends and family. Together we can create better futures for differently-abled children!</p>

Right now I am aiming for mid-to-late-2021, but there are potential roadblocks in each step that may delay opening. It also probably goes without saying, but the current situation surrounding the Coronavirus pandemic may provide further delays. </p><p><u><strong>The current timeline is looking a little something like this:</strong></u></p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Finding a space</strong> - Finding the right space takes time, and though I have a few leads, I need to make sure all requirements are met for the municipality, county, and state. Local ordinances, permits, and bylaws come heavily into play when it comes to an establishment housing food and animals together. </li>
<li>
<strong>Renovations</strong> - Once the space is found, major renovations will be needed. On top of constructing a separate room for the Cat Lounge two HVAC systems will be necessary in order to be in compliance with sanitation. One system will be exclusive to the Cat Lounge, and the other for the café and food preparation areas, ensuring no cross contamination is possible through ventilation systems.  This is just one example of following regulations during the build to ensure that everything is up to code before moving on.</li>
<li>
<strong>Equipment and Furnishings </strong>- Once renovations are completed, its all about the things we need. Equipment like brewers for coffee, plates for cakes, and ingredients like tea leaves will all need to be bought and stored. Tables and chairs will need to be bought and set up for the Café section, and then the Cat Lounge will need extra attention to make the space comfortable for both visitors and feline guests. The human patrons are not the only ones that will need items for their stay. The Cats will need food, bowls for food and water, litter pans and litter, toys, catnip, treats, and furniture to play, sleep, and hide in. </li>
<li>
<strong>Inspections</strong> - Inspections must take place before the lounge will be able to accept cats and open doors. Following regulations through the build will help mitigate any potential issues here, but with Cat Cafe's being an uncommon new business type, there may be changes that have to be made at final inspection.</li>

<strong>Microchip Scanners and Microchips: </strong>This will allow us to not only scan stray cats for microchips, giving them a better chance at being reunited with their families, but it will also allow us to chip our community cats and our adoptable cats to ensure everyone can make it home safe in the event they are lost.  </li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">​<strong>Vet Bills:</strong>  The biggest chunk of this funding will likely be going to this right here. An average cat needs to have shots, tests, and of course spay/neuter before going home, and that is without any form of needed medical expenses like dentals, wound care, or pre-existing conditions.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello!  This is Dalton &amp; Patrice and we are a dynamic duo, husband and wife team dedicated to serving up quality specialty coffee to coffee lovers in our community and beyond.  Our coffee is locally roasted by Carrboro Coffee Roasters and our manual brewing methods ensure consistent quality in each cup.  </p>
<p>Both of us are Army Veterans and in particular, Dalton served in Iraq where he picked up the name ""Hollywood"" from a Command Sergeant Major that saw him all geared up from the sandstorms and wearing sunglasses.  Years later, Dalton became a filmmaker and we knew that would be the name for our coffee business.  </p>
<p>We picked the coffee business because we not only love coffee but as filmmakers, we're always looking for the next film gig and we all know that ""Films Equals Jobs"".  So between film jobs, we make coffee and build community!  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>Our goal for this campaign is to raise $3000.</strong>  Two years ago we ran a similar campaign to raise money for our coffee trailer.  With your help, we were able to purchase it last year and hit the road.  Because we didn't reach our goal last year we were only able to buy the trailer and not the equipment to go with it.  This is where we're calling on your help once again to help us purchase an Espresso Machine.  We've decided to make this campaign short and sweet so that we can get espresso in your hands as quickly as possible.  Meeting our $3000 goal will help us with the down payment of the machine and once we surpass our goal it will help us pay it off completely and add additional equipment needed to expand our business.  </p>
<p>We have so many more great ideas to expand Hollywood Java and give our community the greatest experience.  Stay tuned for more!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>In addition to your contribution, other ways you can help us is by spreading the word about our campaign and about Hollywood Java.  Please share this link with all of the coffee lovers that you know around the world.  Follow our social media pages in Instagram, Twitter and Facebook at HollywoodJavaNC.  Lastly, whenever you see us setting up at an event come see us and grab a Cup of Hollywood!  God Bless you all and thank you for your continued support!</p>

ArrancaPR is a nonprofit started by Puerto Ricans living in the United States to help transfer technical skills to those living in the island.
What is a hackerspace?
Is a place where people with interest in technology and in the creation of products or ""hacks"" can gather.
This is aligned with our goals in Arranca PR, since it would be ideal to have a center in the island for people to congregate and attend our lessons.
Below are some images of what we expect the place to look and some of the basic interactions we expect.

Above we can see a group working on their project together with their tools on the table. The guy in the brown shirt has a breadboard where he is testing his circuit.


On this second image we have a team working on the soldering station why they wait for a 3d print for their case to complete.

Who is working on this project?
Right now I'm leading the organization. My name is Alfredo Alvarez I'm a software developer by day and a 3d printer enthusiast in my free time. I lived in Seattle for the past 5 years while working for Microsoft and currently work for georiot.com.

Innovation Economy trends. Together, we can provide the opportunity to thousands
of people in the island to learn about 3d printing, CNC, arduinos, among other technologies and methods.   What Do We Need & What Do You Get 
This campaign will
help us with the startup costs for the center. We plan on selling memberships and
ask for donations to support day to day operations.

   The Impact The center will be in Isabela, Puerto Rico a town has 45k inhabitants, and is next to some of the largest engineering companies in the island (Infotech, Honeywell, Axxon and Hewlett Packard). By placing it in this location, we expect the following outcomes:  Help people in Puerto Rico figure out what is possible to do with current technology. Create a focal point for technology near the engineering center that is the west coast of Puerto Rico. Inspire others to build similar centers around the island.
Show options for teenagers that are interested in product creation.
Promote technological products that can be sold in the global market. 
The organization is right now providing courses online that can be seen in our you tube page. This is the curriculum that we currently have planned.

stories of people who find themselves at the edge of the world and seek a place
to heal and ground themselves.
Bailey’s Café is a Brooklyn-based, 501(c)(3)
charitable organization dedicated to providing creative and collaborative
environments to communities across New York City.  We create these types
of environments through partnerships with local leaders and inter-generational
volunteers, all focused on community-building through service and the arts.
We believe in
nurturing and guiding individuals in their pursuit of self-knowledge through acting,
video making, writing, service, cooking, music, dance, and fine arts.  We
aim to create an atmosphere of collective awareness, respect and
responsibility, built on the talents and resources of the community.
Visit our website
for additional information on our Core Values, Mission Statement, community programs, and more.


What We Need 


As a community organization, we create
physical and virtual spaces in partnership with local leaders, artists, and
inter-generational volunteers, through a focus on community building, service,
and the arts.
But in the 11
years that we have been running programs, Bailey’s Café has never had a place to call home!
In a few
short weeks, we will take up residence in Bedford-Stuyvesant Brooklyn, thus
transforming the future of Bailey’s Café and the lives of those it touches. 
With our new home, we can create opportunities for economic
development, social entrepreneurship, community engagement, and artistic
expression.
While it has everything that we need (reasonable rent,  1800 sq. ft., and a central location), our new home (formerly a barber shop) still needs lots of renovations (interior and exterior) and equipment (laptops, a printer, basic furniture for inter-generational gatherings and story-sharing).Here are our costs:



MATERIALS (electrical and structural)  
$ 8,000


EQUIPMENT (laptops, etc.)
$ 2,000


OCCUPANCY (taxes, etc.)
$ 5,000


FURNITURE
$ 5,000


LABOR
$10,000


TOTAL
$30,000




Your Impact
 
Through our School-Based and Summer Programming, we impact the lives of 600 youth on a yearly basis; while
currently enrolling 100 youth per year.Your donation, whether it’s $1 or $100, will directly impact each and
every one of those youths, their families, and their futures.How many lives did your dollar change today?Risks & Challenges 
The greatest risk is if you don’t support Bailey’s Café (donate, share with your friends, or volunteer).
    Other Ways You Can Help 
Remember that even as little as
$1 will benefit Bailey’s program participants (and you’ll be invited to the
Grand Opening Celebration)!  If you can’t
contribute now, there are other ways to get involved: you can easily spread the
word to your friends by using Indiegogo Share Tools or volunteer your time!

We thank you for your support and time and hope that you believe in Bailey’s Café as much as we do! Thank You!

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h2>The Impact <br/>
</h2>Historically, our waterways in DC were dirty and dangerous and no place to 
relax or enjoy; today they are cleaner and more inviting than ever 
before. Over half the people in the world live in coastal regions, and most of those people would like to spend more time on and near the water. We know river-based business can be successful. <br/><br/>We also know that the poorest and sickest among us seldom get the chance to enjoy the <i>spiritual and economic benefits</i> of the beautiful rivers in our midst.  Our personal mission is simple: create jobs, strong relationships, and a sustainable economy for ALL people in our community.  This means spending a larger portion of our time and efforts supporting community organizations with a view toward protecting water resources for all people and ending some of the suffering in the neighborhoods.  Yes, we believe that we can and must use our unique business in this way. <br/><br/>Our old Captains and crew - who are also the owners and operators - have an incredible 35-year track record in the southwest DC community.  We're not talking about a cruise here or there.  We are talking about major campaigns, events and festivals for our community such as our first Tall Ships Festival hosting historic vessels like the <i>Amistad</i>, the Southwest Arts Festival, the Kidney Foundation Festivals, the annual Blessing of the Fleet, the annual Easter Seals Cruise for Kids, the new National Cherry Blossom Festival, the founding of the Anacostia Watershed Society, wounded vets and veteran couples fellowship events, teas for the Washington Tea Society for African American Young Girls, Samaritan Ministry of Greater Washington fundraising, a lecture series on History of Black Mariners on the Potomac, the founding of a new Sea Scout Ship, and countless philanthropic events with churches in the neighborhood.<br/><br/>Please join Captains and crew Eric, Walt, Kevin, Gunner, Dennis, Debbie, Bill, and Al in the next decade of giving all people in DC a sense of joy and ownership in their incredible rivers and placing citizenship ahead of profit!<br/> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> We have two big challenges. The first is getting these two old boats ready for the 2015 season. We are running out of time! The second is that we have spent so much time on the boats we are behind on marketing and getting the word out. In addition, all the traditional risks of the boat business apply (safety, navigation, machinery, and weather). </p>
<p>While these risks may appear large, they are manageable if we can avoid the high debt that comes with traditional boat financing options. We have an incredibly gifted team, including two master shipwrights, a 
master engineer, highly experienced Captains, and a yacht steward. Two members of the team have successfully started and run businesses for a combined total of over 50 years.  <br/></p>
<p>We have the expertise and experience; we need your help to make the final push so that 2015 will be a strong inaugural year for this business and the idea of a community boat company.<br/></p>

<p>The Novak’s used to live in socially excluded locality in destitute conditions. They wanted to leave. Our worker was helping also with this matter. The Novak’s have learned to economize better, to service the debts and therefore they have saved money to pay a new rent. Although they had to face refusing because of their Roma origin, at the end they found with our help a new flat out of the excluded locality. The family still needs our help.

<p>At 21, I was diagnosed with PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome). I was diagnosed at a time when information about PCOS was scarce.  He discovered multiple cysts on both of my overly enlarged ovaries. His exact words to this discovery was “you have PCOS and you won’t be able to have any kids!” the words casually spewed out of his mouth as if he was scheduling me for my next doctor’s appointment. I sat there heartbroken as if I lost a part of me that day. For the days that followed I cried sporadically. I always dreamed of one-day birthing a child of my own and it felt as if that part of my life was over. Not being able to have children left me with a feeling of being less than a woman. Being an optimist, I knew that I would have to eventually view the world as a place filled with endless possibilities again.  I began meditating, taking yoga classes and coming to terms with the idea of not having children. I decided to place my energy in creating a center that would cater to providing support groups for people who have various disabilities &amp;  illnesses and the individuals support them.</p>

SVA as a fine arts major in the fall I want to start an online business selling
my art. The money I raise will go towards equipment such as printers and camera
accessories, art supplies, and some initial start up money for the first few

I will also have to buy the necessary chemicals, and paper. I also experiment
in mixed media including adding my poetry to photos and acrylic painting. For
my digital photography work I will need Photoshop, and a new laptop to organize

SVA as a fine arts major in the fall I want to start an online business selling
my art. The money I raise will go towards equipment such as printers and camera
accessories, art supplies, and some initial start up money for the first few
orders of shipping and handling. I will mainly be doing darkroom photography so
I will also have to buy the necessary chemicals, and paper. I also experiment
in mixed media including adding my poetry to photos and acrylic painting. For
my digital photography work I will need Photoshop, and a new laptop to organize
photos, to use Photoshop more effectively and manage business. All of the items I
hope to purchase will be not only helpful to my business but also my future
education and overall artistic growth.

In the last year and a half, Little Angels of Honduras has shipped over 5,000 pounds of supplies to hospitals, we have brought 123 U.S. volunteers to the nation, and we have begun both a counseling program for mothers of hospitalized newborns as well as an adolescent pregnancy prevention program.

<p>In 2015 Little Angels has the unique opportunity to build a 4,200 square foot addition onto Escuela Hospital in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. This addition will be built immediately above the existing NICU to add space for hospitalization and to increase benefits associated with the Kangaroo Mother Care program. Kangaroo Mother Care is a program that involves the mother directly in the survival and development of her premature infant through one year of corrected age. <b>The addition will provide 50 new beds for infant hospitalization, <u>DOUBLING</u> the hospital’s capacity to treat infants in need of medical intervention.</b></p>
<h4>
<span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">While in 2014, only 47% of babies who required hospitalization actually received it, our vision for 2016 is that 100% of babies will receive dignified

These spaces will provide mothers with a restroom, a place to refrigerate and heat food, and lockers to store their belongings. The second zone also includes the outpatient Kangaroo Mother Care Clinic so that any deviation in the development of low birth weight infants can be monitored and corrected during their first year of life. There is a waiting room with a reception area, a room for collective consult and group education, and three examination rooms for counseling and orientation, physical therapy, and ophthalmology. <b>The third and final zone (shown in yellow)</b> consists of a classroom for the education of neonatal fellows (to compliment Little Angels initiative to open a new neonatology fellowship in January 2016).<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>

<p>As mentioned above, our team estimates this addition to cost $210,000 for construction costs. Little Angels of Honduras plans to
finance these costs and oversee the design and construction. A third party will furnish the
new addition and the ongoing sustainability of the unit will be provided by
Escuela Hospital. In February 2015, a memorandum of understanding was signed
with the Directors of Escuela Hospital and they have made consequential provisions
in their budget for staffing and medical needs.</p>

<p>Baby Jose was born premature at 33 weeks gestational age. He requires respiratory support and artificial heat until he is able to gain weight and be able to auto-regulate these functions. He needs hospitalization in an intermediate care unit where he can be located in an incubator and have access to oxygen. But Jose is already 8 days old and space still hasn’t become available to move him into the NICU. He is instead being kept in a small room with multiple other babies awaiting hospitalization. With each hour that passes, Jose’s risk of contracting an infection from the babies around him rises. There is a <b>53% </b>chance that he will <b>D I E</b> in this room, without ever being able to meet his mother or given the proper chance to fight for his life. <br/></p>

What she didn’t know was that at the time of Senny’s daughter’s birth, the NICU was over-saturated and there was no space to treat her daughter. The hospital staff instead took her daughter to a small waiting room with seven other babies who were also awaiting hospitalization. While there, Senny’s daughter caught a second, more severe infection from a baby she was placed in a bassinet with. Senny’s daughter <b>DIED</b> five days after birth.

Little Angels of Honduras is a U.S. 501 (c) (3) not for profit organization whose mission is to reduce maternal-infant mortality in the nation of Honduras. It was founded in 2013 after the loss of infant Lily Castro to missionary parents Javier and Katie Castro. In the last year and a half, Little Angels of Honduras has shipped over 5,000 pounds of supplies to hospitals, we have brought 123 U.S. volunteers to the nation, and we have begun both a counseling program for mothers of hospitalized newborns as well as an adolescent pregnancy prevention program. Now, in 2015, we’re ready to go one step further. And we invite YOU to come alongside us. 

   2. The Problem 





 At the largest public hospital in Honduras, 53% of babies who require hospitalization D I E because of inadequate space.










   3. The Solution 




In 2015 Little Angels has the unique opportunity to build a 4,200 square foot addition onto Escuela Hospital in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. This addition will be built immediately above the existing NICU to add space for hospitalization and to increase benefits associated with the Kangaroo Mother Care program. Kangaroo Mother Care is a program that involves the mother directly in the survival and development of her premature infant through one year of corrected age. The addition will provide 50 new beds for infant hospitalization, DOUBLING the hospital’s capacity to treat infants in need of medical intervention.

While in 2014, only 47% of babies who required hospitalization actually received it, our vision for 2016 is that 100% of babies will receive dignified
medical care and the ability to lead lives
of significance. 







4. The Design 




The addition is divided into three zones. The first zone (shown in pink) is for newborn hospitalization. It includes an area for intermediate care, an area for minimal care, and administrative spaces. The second zone (shown in blue) is for the Kangaroo Mother Care Program. It includes three support spaces for mothers who will be “kangarooing” their inpatient babies for long periods of time. These spaces will provide mothers with a restroom, a place to refrigerate and heat food, and lockers to store their belongings. The second zone also includes the outpatient Kangaroo Mother Care Clinic so that any deviation in the development of low birth weight infants can be monitored and corrected during their first year of life. There is a waiting room with a reception area, a room for collective consult and group education, and three examination rooms for counseling and orientation, physical therapy, and ophthalmology. The third and final zone (shown in yellow) consists of a classroom for the education of neonatal fellows (to compliment Little Angels initiative to open a new neonatology fellowship in January 2016).










As mentioned above, our team estimates this addition to cost $210,000 for construction costs. Little Angels of Honduras plans to
finance these costs and oversee the design and construction. A third party will furnish the
new addition and the ongoing sustainability of the unit will be provided by
Escuela Hospital. In February 2015, a memorandum of understanding was signed
with the Directors of Escuela Hospital and they have made consequential provisions
in their budget for staffing and medical needs.




We are so close. But we need YOUR help.
We expect an average of 2,000 lives to be saved every year through this facility. If you donate to our 4,200 Feet of Hope campaign, you can be certain that in the next five years, your donation will have influenced 10,000 lives. 



5. Real Lives; Real Stories 



Baby Jose was born premature at 33 weeks gestational age. He requires respiratory support and artificial heat until he is able to gain weight and be able to auto-regulate these functions. He needs hospitalization in an intermediate care unit where he can be located in an incubator and have access to oxygen. But Jose is already 8 days old and space still hasn’t become available to move him into the NICU. He is instead being kept in a small room with multiple other babies awaiting hospitalization. With each hour that passes, Jose’s risk of contracting an infection from the babies around him rises. There is a 53% chance that he will D I E in this room, without ever being able to meet his mother or given the proper chance to fight for his life. 









Senny is a 27 year old from Tegucigalpa, Honduras. Her first child was born on November 9th, 2013. Although her family’s resources are meager, she and her husband anticipated very much the birth of their first child. But Senny’s baby girl was born with an infection. She was taken away from Senny moments after birth. Senny believed that her baby girl was being taken away to receive treatment to make her strong. What she didn’t know was that at the time of Senny’s daughter’s birth, the NICU was over-saturated and there was no space to treat her daughter. The hospital staff instead took her daughter to a small waiting room with seven other babies who were also awaiting hospitalization. While there, Senny’s daughter caught a second, more severe infection from a baby she was placed in a bassinet with. Senny’s daughter DIED five days after birth. Senny never had the opportunity to meet her. 
There are HUNDREDS of women just like Senny every year. They are turned away from hospitals in Honduras with empty arms because of inadequate space for their babies to be treated.

 just a bit more profit for the restaurant, also having seen the way 
of making massive produced foods and also knowing what they put in them,

<p>  Thirdly, I leave in an island worldwide known (Santorini) that 
means, that during summer in every single corner there is a restaurant 
or a “food place” but during winter is really hard to find a place to 
eat REALLY good food and if you’ll find there are not many options, 
besides fast food restaurants, meaning places with souvlaki there are 
less than ten “good” restaurants in the whole island, so even the few 
visitors that came to the island in the winter don’t have many options, that's
 negative asset in my opinion. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1245738/files/20150224095830-IMG_0780.JPG?1424800710"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>

</div><p><b></b></p><p><b>Oveedia-- Internet-Based Travel Website and Booking
Engine</b></p>
<p>An <b>Internet booking engine</b> (IBE) is an application
which assists the travel and tourism industry support reservations through the
Internet. It helps consumers in booking flights, hotels,
holiday packages, insurance and other services online. This is a much needed
application for the aviation industry, as it has become one of the fastest
growing sales channels in the world.</p>
<p>In the early days of American aviation, passengers
were very few and the airlines did not fly regularly, as they do at present.
Ticket fares were regulated by the Civil Aeronautics Board. All routes, fares
and flight schedules were published in the Official Airline Guide and travel
agents requested reservations by phone or telefax. As the number of passengers
flying annually began to grow, this manual system could not suffice and the
airlines looked at upgrading their methods of ticketing.</p>
<p>In 1946, American Airlines was the very first to
establish and launch an automated booking system. This was called the
Electromechanical Reservisor, which comprised a temporary storage of magnetic
drums. The airline’s operators had to do the actual flight searches, as travel
agents could not directly access the system.</p>
<p>1953 marked the birth of complex airline
reservation systems, when American Airlines launched the SABRE (Semi-Automatic
Business Research Environment) reservation system. Next came DATAS by Delta,
Apollo by United Airlines and PARS by Trans World Airlines. Eventually these
were all replaced by complex Computer reservations systems (CRSs). Originally
operated by airlines, CRSs were later extended for the use of travel agents,
who could access the systems and make reservations themselves.</p>
<p>In the early 1980's, CRSs were upgraded with more
features and the new systems were able to book and sell tickets for multiple
Airlines, where the earlier CRSs could handle only one reservation at a time.
These newly developed systems were called Global Distribution Systems (GDS).
Eventually, airlines divested their direct holdings in GDS companies, with the
notable exception of the Asian carriers, who remain owners of the following
GDSs: Abacus, Topas, Axess, Infini and Travelsky. In addition, Amadeus has Air
France/ KLM, Lufthansa and Iberia as minority shareholders.</p>
<p>Through a GDS, travel agents could easily retrieve
the information needed about numerous Airlines, all in one location. They had
greater information-searching and booking capabilities.</p>
<p>Yet, passengers themselves still needed a travel
agent’s assistance when booking an airline. If any passenger wanted to book a
seat, or go through a Schedule, they would have to contact the travel agents.
So, the airlines needed a web-based booking system which would allow passengers
to directly retrieve information about the air schedules, complete bookings,
etc. That is when the Internet Booking Engines (IBEs) were introduced. IBEs are
used by nearly every airline at present, to cut off extra expenses and to allow
for instant booking and payment.</p>
<p><b>Oveedia by PURE</b></p>
<p><b>Oveedia</b> is
being designed to increase bookings and revenues, as a 24/7 sales and marketing
tool. Fully customizable, OVEEDIA can be tailored to reflect the brand image of
each property in the system. The platform supports and provides guests
with a professional and positive first impression of the hotels in the regional
hubs. The PURE Hospitality Solutions hotel booking engine is easy to use and
navigate. It provides guests with direct, real-time access to a hotel’s
website, content, pictures, rates, and availability.</p>
<p>We previously designed an IBE called FROL, but now
it´s time to take it to the next level:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using
     Facebook, Google +, Microsoft, or Linkedin login ID’s as well as
     customized Login Systems. The platform will be very quick and
     powerful, and will assist in increasing web registrations.</li>
<li>Twitter
     integration in Support Center Plus. It enables the hotelier to feel
     the ease and track their customers' comments or Support Queries in the
     form of Tweets, Respond to those tickets raised with tweets, or have it
     created as a request for further correspondence.</li>
<li>Google
     Maps integration. </li>
<li>Customer
     relationship management (CRM) often makes use of social media to build up
     customer relationships. Some CRM systems integrate social media sites like
     Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook to track and communicate with customers
     sharing their opinions and experiences with a company’s products and
     services.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Programming, Marketing and Continuity</b></p>
<ul>
<li>We are building a software to manage the database of hotel room
     inventories or allotments. </li>
<li>Hotel
     owners will submit their allotment to our database and we will post their
     inventory online. The end users can book a room and also bundle the room
     with tours, car rentals, or other amenities.</li>
<li>Marketing is crucial. We need a strong campaign to invite hoteliers
     to upload their hotel inventories to our website. </li>
<li>If we do not raise the required funds for this project, we will
     raise other funds via private investors.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Central American and The Caribbean Hubs</b></p>
<p>Once the platform is up and running, we will start
a marketing campaign to invite hoteliers in Central America and the Caribbean, to submit their properties</p>
<ul>
<li>According
     to Tripadvisor there are 2850 lodging places and 2930 vacation rentals
     in <b>Costa Rica</b>. </li>
<li>Meanwhile Tripadvisor only shows 1100 lodging places and 930
     vacation rentals in <b>Panama</b>; 130 lodging places and 5
     vacation rentals in <b>Nicaragua</b>; 590 lodging places and 280
     vacation rentals in Honduras; 310 lodging places and 60 vacation rentals

     rentals in <b>Belize; </b>and 970 lodging places and 1930
     vacation rentals in the<b> Dominican Republic.</b> </li>
<li>For
     decades, one of the most important economical activities of Costa Rica has
     been the tourism. The other countries in the area have had struggles with
     technology. This is where Oveedia IBE software, installed on the different
     websites / hubs for Central American and the Caribbean has found a
     niche. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Pros and Cons</b></p>
<p>Like any other project, Oveedia by PURE has its
pros and cons</p>
<p><b>PROS</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Unique interactive portal with online booking capabilities</li>
<li>A place for hoteliers to submit their properties (photos,
     amenities, in the area) making Oveedia a 24/7 point of sale. </li>
<li>Will provide travelers and patrons the opportunity to intimately
     view the property prior to their potential reservations</li>
<li>We speak Spanish and we know the area very well.</li>
<li>In 2007, a development team in Costa Rica became aware that the
     local industry had no access to a processing and reservation tool. The
     conclusion of the industry review, confirmed that the majority of Costa
     Rica’s hotel and service providers in the tourism industry were not
     using their website to the fullest of its potential.</li>
<li>We will generate three source of revenue: 1) Commissions per
     booking 2) Website Banners 3) Sponsored Ads</li>
</ul>
<p><b>CONS</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Unique concept in the area in countries where technology is not as
     developed as other areas.</li>
<li>New platforms generally take time to garner larger numbers of
     visitors</li>
<li>Remains a unique niche that is very exciting to many; not all</li>

     services.

Programming, Marketing and Continuity

We are building a software to manage the database of hotel room
     inventories or allotments. 
Hotel
     owners will submit their allotment to our database and we will post their
     inventory online. The end users can book a room and also bundle the room
     with tours, car rentals, or other amenities.
Marketing is crucial. We need a strong campaign to invite hoteliers
     to upload their hotel inventories to our website. 
If we do not raise the required funds for this project, we will
     raise other funds via private investors.

Central American and The Caribbean Hubs
Once the platform is up and running, we will start
a marketing campaign to invite hoteliers in Central America and the Caribbean, to submit their properties

According
     to Tripadvisor there are 2850 lodging places and 2930 vacation rentals
     in Costa Rica. 
Meanwhile Tripadvisor only shows 1100 lodging places and 930
     vacation rentals in Panama; 130 lodging places and 5
     vacation rentals in Nicaragua; 590 lodging places and 280
     vacation rentals in Honduras; 310 lodging places and 60 vacation rentals
     in El Salvador; 910 lodging places and 170 vacation
     rentals in Guatemala; 570 lodging places and 400 vacation
     rentals in Belize; and 970 lodging places and 1930
     vacation rentals in the Dominican Republic. 
For
     decades, one of the most important economical activities of Costa Rica has
     been the tourism. The other countries in the area have had struggles with
     technology. This is where Oveedia IBE software, installed on the different
     websites / hubs for Central American and the Caribbean has found a
     niche. 

Pros and Cons
Like any other project, Oveedia by PURE has its
pros and cons
PROS

Unique interactive portal with online booking capabilities
A place for hoteliers to submit their properties (photos,
     amenities, in the area) making Oveedia a 24/7 point of sale. 
Will provide travelers and patrons the opportunity to intimately
     view the property prior to their potential reservations
We speak Spanish and we know the area very well.
In 2007, a development team in Costa Rica became aware that the
     local industry had no access to a processing and reservation tool. The
     conclusion of the industry review, confirmed that the majority of Costa
     Rica’s hotel and service providers in the tourism industry were not
     using their website to the fullest of its potential.
We will generate three source of revenue: 1) Commissions per
     booking 2) Website Banners 3) Sponsored Ads

CONS

Unique concept in the area in countries where technology is not as
     developed as other areas.
New platforms generally take time to garner larger numbers of
     visitors
Remains a unique niche that is very exciting to many; not all

If you like the idea 
There are other ways that you can help. Keep in
touch with us, once our website is up and running, upload and share your hotel
pictures. You can also share the concept with your friends using the Indiegogo
social tools. With your help, we can make Oveedia the Internet’s one stop
destination for hotel bookings and experiences from users around the world.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Today’s politicians have become so corrupted by outside influences – campaign contributors, lobbyists, and special interests – that they can no longer be trusted to act in our best interests. Luckily, there is a solution! By directly voting on legislation, we will retake control of Congress and return power to the people. Here’s how it all works.</p>
<h3>Introducing: The Direct Democracy Party</h3>
<p>The Direct Democracy Party (DDP) is a brand new non-partisan political party. The DDP will revolutionize the United States government by giving the public the ability to directly vote on legislation. With the help of the DDP website, your congressman will know where the people stand. After the citizens vote, he will carry the majority vote to congress. Your vote will be his vote.</p>
<p>The DDP will compete in congressional elections, running candidates alongside the major parties. However, our candidates don’t take stances on political issues. Their platform is to vote how we vote, to take our stance as their stance. They will not pander to lobbyists, corporations, or campaign contributors. They will make our votes matter again and give us the voice we deserve in Washington.</p>
<h3>Party Platform</h3>
<p>Any system where representatives can enjoy a 90% incumbency rate, while hitting approval rating lows of 9%, is clearly corrupt. The DDP will eliminate corruption, minimize outside influences, and return ownership of Washington to the people of the United States.</p>
<p>A number of very popular solutions have been proposed, such as campaign finance reform. The problem, however, is that popular support does not translate to congressional action – outside influences are overriding the will of the people. We need a solution that does NOT require congressional approval.</p>
<p>The DDP solution: Our representatives will be explicitly non-partisan. DDP representatives in Congress will vote according to their district’s votes, gathered online. Our representatives will not make our decisions for us – we will make the decisions on every bill presented to Congress.</p>
<p>This plan does not require congressional approval – the DDP plan can be implemented within the existing framework.All we need to do is vote DDP candidates into office.</p>
<p>Many voters don’t have the time or interest to vote on every issue. Accordingly, each voter may choose a single delegate – a trusted friend, family member, or community figure. If a voter does not vote on an issue, the delegate “inherits” the user’s vote. This allows users to be involved at their own comfort level, while ensuring their values are still represented. Delegates have been used to this effect throughout history.</p>
<h3>The Future is Now</h3>
<p>Direct Democracy has been the inspiration for democratic societies for centuries; however, the sheer mechanics of collecting votes from an entire populace has kept direct democracy out of reach. The internet has provided us an historic opportunity – for the first time, it is actually feasible to collect individual votes regularly.</p>
<p>We no longer have to sit by and watch Washington sell out the American people.</p>
<p>Today, we fight back!</p>
<h3>Get Involved</h3>
<p>Please support the cause of direct democracy, by becoming a DDP member! Perks are available at a variety of levels, starting at $10.</p>

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>This campaign is being led by two lifetime technologists, alumni of Carnegie Mellon‘s prestigious Computer Science program. With awards in competitive programming, and a combined 20+ years of experience developing, operating, and managing startups, you can trust that we will build a secure and robust voting portal.</p>
<h3>Initial Plan of Action</h3>
<p>We will initially campaign in just one or two districts. These first districts will be chosen based on where the most DDP supporters are. From there, we will learn, refine, and expand.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>Encryption technologies such as RSA and SSL will ensure the website is very secure. Over the last decade, we have seen the rise of online banking, shopping, and even stock market trading with these security features. There’s no reason we can’t vote online as well.</p>
<p>To guarantee the integrity of the system, the public will have the ability to completely audit the voting record. An anonymized public record allows voters to ensure that no votes are tampered with. Additionally, a third-party monitor will take samples to verify that the public’s votes are recorded properly. The monitor will also track our congressman's votes to ensure they are voting with their district.</p>
<h3>A Note on Third Parties</h3>
<p>58% of Americans believe a third party is necessary. But traditionally, it is difficult for a third party to win an election. Why will we succeed where others have not?</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Our platform is specific and unifying. Other parties have traditional party platforms, taking stances on divisive issues. The DDP is non-partisan; by keeping our platform narrow, we appeal to citizens across the political spectrum.</p></li>
<li><p>The time is right. Record numbers of Americans are fed up with our current system. Even now, Congress continues to ignore its citizens: negotiating treaties in secret, and supporting arcane cable monopolies.</p></li>
<li><p>We are offering real change. A traditional third party does not get much notice for winning a seat in the house, because the party platform is often similar to one of the big two. Bringing the party platform of direct democracy to Washington would be revolutionary! The promise of real change will spark demand for direct democracy across the nation.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3>Schedule</h3>
<p>If this funding campaign is successful, we plan to launch a campaign and release the voting website for the 2016 elections.</p>
<p>This is our rough schedule:</p>
<p>Mid 2015 – Select seat(s) to contest<br/>
End 2015 – Select DDP candidate(s)<br/>
Early 2016 – Beta DDP website launch<br/>
Mid/Late 2016 – Run campaign!</p>
<h3>Budget</h3>
<p>The goal is $500,000. We’ve set an ambitious goal, because this is an ambitious project. Changing the world isn’t easy.</p>
<p>This is our rough budget:</p>
<p>$100,000 – Application/Website Development<br/>
$100,000 – Infrastructure/Systems Security<br/>
$50,000 – Business/Legal Development<br/>
$80,000 – Apparel/Perks<br/>
$20,000 – Indiegogo Fee<br/>
$50,000 – Miscellaneous/Unexpected Expenses</p>
<h3>Long-term Vision</h3>
<p>Congressmen not only vote on legislation, but they draft it. They should be drafting legislation that best serves the public, but the issues important to us are too often pushed aside to write bills pandering to donors, lobbyists, and corporations.</p>
<p>When the DDP puts control of Congress back in our hands, it will be easy to pass legislation for common sense reforms. For example, 80%–90% of Americans already support campaign finance reform, which would reduce outside influences on our congressmen. With the direct democracy framework in place, we will be able to get these popular initiatives passed.</p>
<p>Direct democracy isn’t a replacement for other solutions, like campaign finance reform or congressional term limits. In many cases, it is instead a stepping stone to those solutions.</p>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<h4>Is your proposal to vote on congressional and presidential elections online?</h4>
<p>No. We are proposing to have the public vote directly on legislation and remove the decision making power from our representatives in Washington. The website is used to collect the people’s votes.</p>
<h4>How will we convince Congress to let us vote directly on legislation?</h4>
<p>We don’t have to - DDP candidates will run in traditional congressional elections. Our candidates run on the platform of direct democracy, pledging to vote with the majority of their district.</p>
<h4>Do you have to vote DDP to participate?</h4>
<p>Absolutely not! Every eligible voter of a DDP district, regardless of political affiliation, will be granted access to the voting portal.</p>
<h4>Bills are often lengthy and hard to understand, how are we supposed to vote if we can’t understand them?</h4>
<p>Users will be able to submit briefs related to proposed legislation, summarizing and possibly expressing opinions. Other users can read and rate these briefs, in addition to briefs published by registered political parties.</p>
<h4>Won’t delegates become the new power-brokers?</h4>
<p>If votes become too concentrated in the hands of a few delegates, we can restrict the consolidation by limiting the maximum number of voters a delegate can represent. This way, the amount of power a delegate controls will be capped.</p>
<h4>Do we have to win a majority of seats in Congress to have an impact?</h4>
<p>No, if we gain just enough seats to break the majority of either party (which could be as few as a handful), then it pressures one party to work with us, because they won’t be able to pass initiatives unilaterally.</p>
<p>Furthermore, once we gain a few seats and get momentum, existing politicians may decide to run under the DDP banner. Assuming - of course - they renounce their partisan stance and pledge only to vote with their constituency. This would help us to grow much more quickly.</p>
<h4>Will it take long to build the software?</h4>
<p>Absolutely not. In fact, there are at least 2 projects out there working on open-source solutions already. Most likely we will be able to adapt, and expand, one of those solutions. If necessary, both founders have computer science backgrounds, and can build a complete system from scratch in a reasonable time period.</p>
<h4>Why the Buffalo Mascot?</h4>
<p>We have adopted the mighty Buffalo as our party mascot, to represent the power of the individual and the wisdom of the herd. Buffalo have great individual strength, but prefer to exist as one among many.</p>

Drinks the guest can select (as supported from our already hired bar staff) made from 15 home made syrups which the guest can sample and watch as their dream drink becomes reality (see syrup display below). 10 craft beer taps, including 2 custom beers created just for UR bar. Recreational games like shuffleboard, Twister, Giant Jenga; the kind of games you want to play with your friends but probably aren't allowed at home. And with this being Vegas, of course we'll have gaming machines, so if you just want to chill after work with a drink and play a little, of course we've got a place for you. Food will be served tapas style so you can make the meal what you want it to be. This means you can truly make every visit unique depending on what you want to make it.  Having a heated game of Jenga so you don't want to have to keep going to the bar? No problem! We have one of the cheapest bottle services in Las Vegas where even the bottle displays a personal message. Perfect to truly bust your friends b*lls. 
Even the bartenders each have their own catchphrase on their uniform. Music, décor and visuals; of course, you can change them too and truly become part of UR bar. And with 20% off 24/7 for locals (and of course our Indiegogo family), this truly becomes UR bar.Your contributions will allow us to purchase the bar (in a developing area just off the Las Vegas strip), It will also allow us to renovate and buy all necessary opening expenses including inventory, uniforms, marketing and operating systems. Thankfully, doing what we do, we have built up a comprehensive contact list, all of whom recognize the potential in this bar and want to offer their help in the way of cost price goods. These include the construction costs, marketing equipment, POS system and uniform production. What your contributions will help us achieve is shown below. As you can see, it is far cheaper than most bars trying to open in Las Vegas.zzEven my puppy Wee Man has caught the UR bar fever.....So there it is. The dream, the future of Vegas nightlife.... and it's within our grasp. So please let us know you a great time, the best night in Vegas you've ever had; whether you're visiting Vegas or one of our hardworking local industry works. We've got the perfect night for you, night after night, with a different experience every time. So please donate..... and we can't wait to see you soon to cheers over a cheeky cocktail. Of course choosing of course, because it's UR night, it's UR bar.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","THE CAMPAIGN


Philippians 4:13 - I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. 
I am proud to announce that Yesterday’s Glam vintage boutique is going mobile.  A few years ago, I set a goal to expand my brand and consumer demographic by way of a custom new mobile truck and with the help of your donations through indiegogo.com, I will be able to finally attain this goal and take Yesterday’s Glam to a new and innovative level of vintage selling.
Yesterday’s Glam has consulted and will be in collaboration with Prestige Food Trucks to build and custom design the mobile boutique. The total cost to build ad custom design the mobile boutique ranges between $40,000 - $65,000. The truck will take three months to complete and will include a fitting room, an accessories compartment,clothing racks, and all the right touches to deliver a personalized shopping experience.  
Prestige Food Trucks is the world’s leading food truck manufacturer that takes pride in their inferior construction designs for long lasting business.  They specialize in manufacturing mobile units for businesses to advertise and sell effectively, and they are known for their fast turn-around time, competitive pricing, and top notch quality. I am confident that the purchase and design of the truck will further establish the boutiques credibility and  grasp the interest of potential consumers.  
Imagine being able to shop rare finds during your lunch break, at a festival, or even while going for a stroll in your neighborhood.  My goal is for this mobile unit to operate as a brick and mortar boutique yet cater to the geographical convenience of various consumers all while retailing gently recycled, affordable, and unique vintage items. I want to provide an exclusive and tangible vintage shopping experience for all, as most of the one-of-a-kind pieces I sell can’t be found in the average clothing store.  
For this mobile boutique to come into fruition, your substantial donations are needed. I am aiming to reach a goal of $65,000 to assist in paying for the mobile truck. Your support towards my fundraising efforts whether big or small will be greatly appreciated, as every cent will count.  However, for those willing to donate significant amounts can take advantage of the following incentives:
Donations $50 and up will receive a free Yesterday’s Glam shirt, 20% off your first purchase at the mobile boutique, and a free give-away.
If you wish to donate more than once during the campaign (totaling $50 or more), in addition to taking advantage of a free shirt, 20% discount, and free give-away, you will receive first-hand updates on the status of the truck along with an exclusive invitation for sneak peak of the mobile boutique before it officially hits the road at Yesterday’s Glams private pre-launch party.





If you wish to receive more detailed information about this campaign or if you are interested in being an investor, please email me at yesterdaysglam@gmail.com .
Your contribution will give this campaign a tremendous boost.  Thanks in advance for your encouragement and support.

About The Founder & Owner




Shonel Symister was born in Paterson and raised in Clifton New Jersey.  She graduated from Rutgers University with a Bachelors degree in Fine Arts, Concentration in Dance, and was granted the opportunity to travel the nation as a professional dancer immediately afterwards. Just as any professional dancer, Shonel would spend the majority of her days in leotards, tights, and leg warmers. However, contrary to the uniformed look of a dancer, she had a very unique sense of style that she prided herself upon.  She worked retail for major clothing companies in college but found thrifting and vintage shopping for unique finds to fit her style better.  Her love for vintage fashion grew and organically intertwined with her innate passion for the arts and from that emerged the Creative Arts Enthusiast and Fashion Curator behind Yesterday’s Glam. What started out as a hobby in April 2011, transformed into an official business by August 2012 and has been growing nonstop.  Shonel’s great eye for detail and love for anything unique amongst today’s common cycle of carbon copy fashion is what separates Yesterday’s Glam from the other boutiques.  Shonel is a young entrepreneur on the rise to becoming a highly noted and one of a kind vintage buyer and seller in northern New Jersey.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

In his dealings with the justice system, he found nothing but injustice. His only chance to receive justice is to appeal his case. </p><p>This is a costly expense, however, when murder is involved. We need your help obtaining an appellate attorney so that James can get the trial he deserves. He is innocent of the crime for which he has been charged. The attorneys we have spoken with are asking for $25K up front and potentially additional charges.</p><p>Whatever you can spare, we will be more than grateful for. Please donate and share even if you can't donate. Everything counts. </p><p><br/></p><p>This is James's account of the incident and the proceedings thereafter:</p><p>""This is a detailed recap of the events which place on April 14, 2012 (ultimately resulting in my arrest) to date in reference to the criminal case. I certify and attest all statements are true and acurate to the best of my knowledge.</p><p>On the evening of April 14, 2012, I was invited by Victor Scott to his apartment for a barbeque. Vick, at this time, resided with a guy named Mike. I only know Vick because he recently dated my roommate, Veronica. Vick was often at my apartment, so frequently that he basically lived with us. A week prior to the events mentioned here, Vick and Veronica ended their relationship. As a result, Vick moved in with Mike.</p><p>Upon arriving at Mike and Vick's apartment, I encountered a total of five individuals: Mike, his wife, Vick and two guys I did not know (I found later to be named Gene and Jeremy). I asked Vick about the barbeque and he stated that he never told me about a barbeque. Gene and the other guy laughed as if an inside joke existed. Realizing the barbeque was not going to take place, I asked Vick if I could borrow his phone to call Phalecia, since mine was off. He said yes and I called her, asking her to order pizza because Victor was not having a barbeque. She was upset because I should have gone to the store, rather than being lazy, and now we had to waste money on pizza.</p><p>She told me to make sure I was back at the apartment when the pizza arrived because she was on her way home from work (via public transportation) and didn't know if she would be there in time. After hanging up and giving Victor his phone back he asked me if I knew anyone with some weed. I told him 'not really, only Will.'</p><p>Will is a mutual friend of mine and Victor and is actually the person that introduced Victor to Veronica. Will was my roommate in college. That's how we met and we have been friends ever since. Victor called him and asked him if he had some weed and Will told him yes, but he didn't know if he could get a ride to bring it to Victor, so he would have to call him back and let him know. </p><p>While Victor waited, he was calling other people because Will is known for standing people up. While victor was calling other people, Phalecia called back to tell me she ordered the pizza and to head home. I gave Victor his phone back and told him I was leaving. I still needed to walk to the store and make it home to get the pizza. Victor asked me if I would wait for him. He wanted to walk with me but wanted to let his phone charge up a bit. I agreed.</p><p>While we were waiting, he started asking me about Veronica and if she was talking about him since he had been gone. I told him I hadn't really talked to her. He asked if I thought she would talk to him and I said yes. So he started calling her while his phone was plugged in. A few minutes went by and another guy came over that I've never seen before. He asked Victor if he had some weed. Victor told him no, but that he was about to get some. He told the guy to give him his money and he would bring it to him when he got it. At this point, I could see what was going on, but I don't smoke or sell weed, so I wasn't concerned with what he was doing. I was just ready to go. </p><p>Since Victor was still using his phone and there was no way it was charging, I told him again I had to go. He said okay and then he came with me, along with Gene and Jeremy. Everything looked normal. Gene and Jeremy had Nike sports bags on their backs with what I thought was clothes in them because I heard them say they had stayed over the night before. </p><p>As we were walking to the store, Victor was still calling people trying to get weed. He either called Will back or Will called him and Victor asked if Will knew someone else that he could get some weed from Will texted him someone's number, but when this happened I didn't know it. </p><p>Victor told me Will found a ride and would meet him in front of my apartment complex. He didn't really say anything else about weed after that. Victor was on the phone with some female I didn't know. We made it to the store and on the way back Victor told me that the female was going to come pick them up. Gene was on the phone as well on the way back but I don't know him, so I wasn't walking close enough to know what he was talking about, nor do I remember him saying anything about weed. </p><p>I remember Gene talking about going to some girl's house and Jeremy saying he had to get home because his dad was mean and he didn't want to get in trouble. Victor told me after Will met him in front of my apartment that the girl was going to pick them up from there, too. </p><p>As we were walking into the entrance of the complex, Willy pulled up. I know Willy from school six years before. We lived in the same apartment complex -- the same place that I lied with Will in student housing. Will knew Willy as well. </p><p>Originally when Willy pulled up, I thought he saw me walking and was stopping to say hello. I walked up to the car where Willy was sitting in the passenger seat. I didn't know the driver. Willy and I talked for a minute, just catching up, because it had been a while since we had seen each other. After or quick catch up, Willy asked me if I called him for some weed. I told him no, that I don't smoke anymore. I stopped about a year and a half ago for a better job. </p><p>He then told me someone had called him from the complex and I told him it wasn't me. I didn't even have his number anymore. He said okay and I told him I had to get home to get the pizza. I walked back to the sidewalk and told Victor I would see him later and I walked in the gate and went to my apartment. As I was walking away I saw Victor walk up to Willy's car, but I don't know what was said. Then I saw Gene and Jeremy get in the backseat.</p><p>Victor ran up to me after I was in the gate. He was still on the phone. When we reached the first building and parking lot, Victor stopped and I kept walking home. I didn't introduce Willy and Victor or anyone else. I didn't tell Willy that Victor was looking for weed because Victor said Will was coming. And that's the same reason I didn't tell Victor that Willy sold. I wasn't thinking about it. I was just trying to get home to get the pizza because I didn't know if Phalecia had made it home yet.</p><p>I walked past my neighbor, Karl, on the way to the apartment and I told him I needed to talk to him. At the the time, he was on the way to the dumpster. I told him I would come by his apartment after I ate.</p><p>When I got home, Phalecia was there and she had the pizza already. I went to the bathroom and then I went to get a plate of pizza. We ate together in the living room while watching TV. The show was Criminal Minds and I know this because at that time of night, we watched this show almost every night. When a commercial came on I went to take the plate in the kitchen and she went to the bathroom.</p><p>Victor, Gene, and Jeremy were knocking on the door. I opened it and Victor asked me if I could let his friend use the bathroom. I led Jeremy to Veronica's bathroom and I stayed in Veronica's room while he was in there. While I was in the room waiting for Jeremy, I heard Victor in the kitchen and I saw Gene standing in the middle of the room, changing his shoes and his shirt. </p><p>Gene put on some new shoes and a nice shirt. I was thinking he was getting ready to go to the girls house he had been talking about earlier. I also heard Victor and Gene talking, but it was hard to make out what was being said over the TV. But I remember feeling funny because it was like they were whispering or something. I figured it had nothing to do with me, so I ignored it. </p><p>When Jeremy came out of the bathroom, Victor asked me if I had some sandwich bags and I told him where they were. He grabbed a few bags. On the table there were three phones, two black phones and one red. Gene put all of them in his back pack. Victor had his phone plugged in the wall and it rang as they were standing there. He answered it and told the girl that was coming to get them to meet them at the mail box. </p><p>I sat back own on the couch and got back into the show. Victor told me they were about to go. I said okay and that I was about to head out, too. I was going to go upstairs to talk to Karl. I went to grab Phalecia's phone and they left. I told her I would call her when I got to the grocery store.</p><p>Victor, Gene, and Jeremy were at my apartment for ten minutes or less. They didn't give me anything, nor did I take anything from them and they didn't tell me what they had done, nor did they act funny other than Victor and Gene whispering. I didn't see how much weed they had, nor did I see a gun. I did not become aware that they had a gun until later.</p><p>When I walked outside, they were gone. Karl was standing in the parking lot. I asked him if he could give me a ride to the grocery store and he said yes. As we were standing there a lot of cops came driving fast past us and drove back out of the parking lot the way they came in. Karl and I were wondering what was going on, so we walked the way the cops went to see. The street was roped off, making everyone come park in our building's parking lot.</p><p>As we were standing there, other neighbors were talking about what happened. They were saying someone was shot and car jacked by some black dudes. Others were saying it was a drug deal gone bad. Karl and I spoke to a cop and he told us it looked like a drug deal gone bad, so we said okay.</p><p>Phalecia called her cell phone that I had from an unsaved number. The first time she called, I didn't answer, but when she called back, I picked it up. She told me Victor, Gene, and Jeremy were back at the apartment and she wasn't letting them in. I walked home to find Victor, Gene and Jeremy outside the door. I asked Victor what happened, as I was opening the door and his phone rang. It was his ride. She was waiting for him, so I locked the door back without opening it and walked with them to the car. </p><p>I walked back over to Karl and that's when I heard all the different stories from the neighbors. When Victor left, I knew he had to drive through the area that was roped off, so out of concern I called him to make sure they didn't have any problems leaving. I don't remember how the phone call went, but I know called him on his phone and he didn't pick up, so I called the number Phalecia called me from when they were at the apartment. Victor picked up.</p><p>I asked if everything was okay. He said yes. I asked if he saw what happened when he went outside coming to the apartment. He said no and that he had to go and then he hung up. I told Karl that I thought I knew who did this. He told me not to say anything for a number of reasons. </p><p>This was the story I told the police at our first encounter, but the truth is, when Gene and Victor were whispering in my apartment while I was in Veronica's bedroom, I did hear them. I heard Victor ask Gene why he shot them and took their stuff and Gene said because they didn't need it. At that point I was scared for my life and Phalecia's life. I didn't know how bad it was, but I knew something happened and I didn't want to let them know that I knew because, like I said, they were whispering so that I couldn't hear them and I knew I was the only one that knew they were with Willy. </p><p>When I told Karl what I heard and what I thought happened, he asked me if I knew their names. At the time, I didn't. The only person's name I knew was Victor and I only knew his first name. I didn't even know Willy's full name at that point. All I could think of was that they knew were I lived and I knew nothing about them. I figured if I said anything to the police, they would know it was me, since I was the only one who knew they were with Willy, and they would come to kill me and Phalecia, or send someone else to do it.</p><p>I really called Victor when they left, not out of concern, but to make him think I didn't know what they did, so he wouldn't come after me. I called Will to ask him if me and Phalecia could come stay with him for a little while. I told Will what happened, thinking that he gave Victor Willy's number, but I found out later that he didn't. It was someone else's number. </p><p>I wanted to leave that night, but Karl told me not panic and that they wouldn't be back. Mentally, though, I was still panicking. I had never been around something like that to know what would happen next or what to do. I wanted to do whatever I could to help Willy, but at the same time, I was thinking about the lives of Veronica, Phalecia, and me. I called my best friend, Donald, but he told me to call him back, so I called my brother in Texas, Bernard, and told him what happened.</p><p>I let him know if something were to happen to me or Phalecia, that Veronica's boyfriend Victor would be behind it. And he also told me to stay out of it. Two days later I walked to the store and on the way back I stopped by Mike's apartment to make sure Victor thought I didn't know anything. </p><p>I asked him if he heard about what happened that night. He said no and asked me what happened. I told him the neighbors said someone was shot. He then changed the subject and asked me if his probation officer called me. I asked why they would be calling me. I didn't even know he was on probation. Then he said if they didn't call, not to worry about it. I said okay and then I left because I was meeting up with Phalecia at the bus stop to walk home with her. </p><p>I was trying to be as safe as I could because I didn't know what Victor and his friends were thinking, but I tried to stay friendly so he wouldn't think I was acting suspicious. In my first encounters with the police, I told the cops that I went over there to get some weed from him for a friend, so I wouldn't have to tell them I knew what he did up until that point. Then I told the cops I knew Victor had something to do with it when he asked me about his probation officer.</p><p>When I got to the bus stop, I told Phalecia we needed to stay away from him. We thought about reaching out to Willy to assure him that I had nothing to do with it and let him know that I was just walking from the store with them, but we also didn't want to make him think I had something to do with it. Willy had known me for six or seven years and we never had a problem with each other. He knows that I'm not the type of person to be in anything like this. I don't live my life like that at all and I don't hang with people that do, knowingly. That was Monday.</p><p>Two days later, Phalecia and I were sitting on the bed and saw about four cops with dogs in the woods outside our bedroom window. They were so close we could hear what they were saying. At first we were thinking they were just checking because of what happened over the weekend, but as we sat there we saw them pull the cell phones out of the woods that Victor and Gene had on the table when they came over, two black, one red. Then we heard the cops say my name and that's when we started panicking. </p><p>Phalecia told me to go to check the bathroom Jeremy had been in. The trash and everything just to make sure nothing was in the house where they had been. She told me right then that Victor had to be framing me because he is the only person that knew my name and he had those phones when he came over that Saturday. Why else would the cops search there when the incident took place two buildings before ours?</p><p>I listened to what she was saying and it made good sense, so I got mad and called Victor and asked him why the cops were outside my window with the phones I saw them with and saying my name like I was a suspect. Victor told me it was okay, that I wasn't in trouble. He just told the police that they came to my apartment after they got the weed. I asked him why he would say anything about me at all. He came there because it was his girlfriend's apartment and his friend needed to use the bathroom. I hung up on him.</p><p>At that point I was scared and going crazy. I didn't know what to do. I wanted to go outside and tell the cops, but I knew if I did Victor would come shoot the apartment up. Then, on the other hand, I didn't know what the cops were going to do. I just knew they called me a suspect.</p><p>I called Donald, my best friend, he works with cops and has cop friends and his neighbor is a friend of ours and a cop, so I was hoping he could get some help but no one was home at the time. Donald asked me what Victor said and I told him. He told me to call him back to make sure he didn't try to set me up. So I did. I called Victor back on three way with Donald on the phone and I asked him what all he said to the police about me.</p><p>Victor told me that he told the police that I told him to call Will and they came to my apartment. He also told them what he needed to get off probation. I hung up on him again. Donald told me it wasn't against the law to tell someone to call someone and if they did something without me being there or knowing about it then I had nothing to worry about. If Victor and his friends were framing me, they would have to prove what was being said.</p><p>Donald then told me I had nothing to worry about and I should talk to the cops so they don't think I have something to hide, so I said okay. On Thursday, the cops called Phalecia's phone while she was at work and asked her a few questions. She told them I was home when they came over on Saturday, but the cops didn't keep her conversation on record, so it's like that never happened. </p><p>When she came home I called the cop. He asked me where I lived and I told him. He asked me if I would come speak with him to ID some photos. I agreed. I was cooking, so I asked him if it was okay if I came when I was done. He agreed. The cop then called me back about thirty minutes later and asked if I was still coming. I told him that I would me there in fifteen minutes, and I was.</p><p>When I got there we shook hands and he put me in hand cuffs, emptied my pockets, read me my rights, took me in a room, and asked me if I knew the people on the photos. It was Victor and Gene. I told him Victor was my roommate's boyfriend and Gene was his friend, but I didn't know him or his name. I met him Saturday night and we didn't really talk to each other. </p><p>I asked him if I was under arrest and he said we would get to that after I told him what happened. I told him the story without telling him I heard them talking and without telling him why I went to Victor's on Monday. I told the cop a story that I assumed would keep me, my family, and Phalecia safe, but at the same time, let him know that I saw them with Willy.</p><p>I never accused Victor, Gene, and Jeremy of anything because I didn't see it with my own eyes, nor did I want the cops to use me by making them think that it was my fault they were in jail or being pursued. That's why I told the cop the story the way I did. I wanted to help Willy but be safe at the same time. I really told him a lot of assumptions other than what I saw. </p><p>The cop tried to put words in my mouth about making the phone call to set the drug deal up, but I told him that I didn't call anyone but my girl. I don't smoke or sell, so I wasn't calling anyone for weed. The cop sensed me shutting down, so he went to get a recording of him talking on the phone with Victor and he played it.</p><p>Victor told the officer that we were together all day trying to rob people so he could get money to pay his rent, that some guy owed him money and we were going to rob him as well. He told the cop that I called Will and set the drug deal up, that I was there when they robbed Willy and when the gun went off we said to each other 'I hope he didn't shoot them', before I took off running. Then he said I let them hide in my apartment where I gave him a bucket of water to put the phones in. Then he said I gave him a shoe box to put the gun in. He told the cop that I took the phones and put them in the woods and he gave me some of the weed he took. He went on to say that I told him to put the gun in a lake in my so called shoe box. </p><p><b>I broke down and told the cop that he was framing me and all of that was a lie and that I could prove it but the cop didn't care. After that phone call between Victor and the cop, Victor called back 15 minutes later and told the cop he was lying and that I didn't know about what happened. The cop said he was lying and trying to save me because I was scared. </b></p><p><b>I had all types of proof when this first happened, but I sat in the county jail without any help or a lawyer for seven to eight months.</b> My first time in court Phalecia came and told them I was being framed and she had a text from Victor to prove it. He texted her telling me to just 'go tell them the truth and I should be fine.' That was five days after he called the cops and framed me. But because it was my first appearance in court, they said there was nothing they could do and I had to wait to go before the judge.</p><p>I went to court a number of times before I went in front of a judge, but one of the trips to the courthouse I was on the bus with Gene and he told me what he did and that they were going to rob me. That's why Victor told me he was having a barbeque. It was to get me out of the house. Gene and Jeremy were supposed to go rob the apartment, but their ride didn't come to take them. </p><p><b>He also told me how the story they were going to tell about what happened was to set me up because Victor knew I had a clean record and thought they would never prosecute me. Now the bus has a camera on it and he said everything out loud so everyone could hear him. It was like he was bragging about it. At this point that tape may not even exist anymore. I don't know. I don't know how to retrieve it for evidence.</b> He didn't like what Victor was doing to me and he said he would tell his public defender what was going on. </p><p>On this bus, there was a guy that was in the same dorm as me, named  Glen. He heard everything that Gene said and Glen wrote a statement and gave it to me when we got back to the jail, letting it be known that he heard the murderer say I knew nothing and was being framed. </p><p>On the way back from the court house, I was with Willy on the bus and in the holding cell. Glen was there as well. He heard Willy tell me he knew I had nothing to do with it and he watched me go home. Willy also told me he would do whatever to help me because he knows I didn't call him and I wouldn't do anything like that. </p><p>After this, I told my mom to call the DA and have him come talk to me, but she was advised not to do that. When Victor got locked up he put a hit out on me through his gang, and I know this because the person he told ended up in a holding cell with me at the court house and I prayed for him before he went to court.</p><p>He asked me what happened and I told him and he said he could tell I didn't belong there. He told me Victor put a hit out on me through him and he was going to try to call it off, but that Victor knew how the system works and he knew he could help himself by putting me in it. Apparently he did it before to someone else to get off his last case. The guy told me Victor thought I was going to run to the cops when I figured out what he did, so he told the cops a story first so they wouldn't listen to me. He said Victor knew I was lame and didn't know anything about anything, so I was easy to frame. </p><p>I had a roommate that came from Victor's dorm for one  day and we got to talking about our cases. He told me that he had just left Victor's dorm and that he talks about me and Phalecia all the time. This man I had never seen before told me my case and that I was being framed because Victor felt like I was stupid. He said I was always at work while Phalecia was at home doing whatever and Victor was trying to take her from me. He said Phalecia's name, and that's how I knew he was telling the truth. I don't talk about her to anyone.</p><p>When I finally went in front of the judge, I had a court lawyer that talked to me for five minutes before we went in. I told her what I could in that time. When the cop took the stand he said what Victor told him over the phone. He also said that Willy told him I didn't call him -- that the person who robbed him was the person who called him. Willy told them I was not there at all and I didn't even know he was called. The cop said he was waiting for finger prints and phone records to link me to anything, but at that time all he had was what Victor said and the fact that Gene's phone called Phalecia's phone and vice versa. It was the unsaved number Phalecia called me from when they came back to the house and she didn't let them in.</p><p>It also came out that she didn't let them in because it was just Gene and Jeremy standing there and we don't know them. At that time Victor was putting the phones in the woods. But the cop didn't say that part or the part about how the shoe box was a female shoe box. He also didn't say how there were ten eye witnesses and none of them said anything about me. </p><p>There was a man sitting in his car in the parking space right next to them, watching the whole thing, plus, some people on their balconies looking over the whole parking lot. The cop had no evidence on me at all, but Victor's lies. My public defender made it very clear that I was not a criminal based off my record.</p><p><b>Everyone was denied bond because of their records. When they got to me they saw I had no record, then the man on the side with the laptop, who I think became the prosecutor on the case, said nothing was showing up but one screen was locked. So my court attorney asked me if I ever had any charges. I told her I got a ticket five years ago for driving without a license. She smiled and told the judge I never had any criminal charges. The judge denied bond for no reason. She told me she would give me one in two weeks when we came back to see her, but that never happened.</b></p><p><b>Next, they got the finger prints back and mine were not on anything. The phone calls were how I said they were. They tried to indict me alone, but they didn't have any evidence and they were turned down. So they indicted me with everyone else and gave me nineteen charges: murder, seven counts of felony murder, hijacking a motor vehicle, two counts of armed robbery, two counts aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, criminal attempt to commit violation of Georgia controlled substances act, conspiracy to commit violation of the Georgia controlled substances act, two counts of possession of a firearm during commission of a felony, possession of a firearm by first offender probationer, and tampering with evidence.</b></p><p>When I did get a public defender in November, he told me they were able to do that because I knew Victor and Willy were together. His name was Mr. Farmer, but I had another public defender before Mr. Farmer for two weeks. I called him on the jail phones and he told me to try to get statements from my co-defendants to prove my innocence. I knew if I did that, he couldn't use it, so I called my mom and told her was I was told to do. The next week I was assigned to the director, Mr. Francis.</p><p>When I spoke with Mr. Francis, I could tell something funny was going on, but I didn't know what. He told me they had nothing and that's all he really said. After that he just kept telling me don't talk on the phones and he told my mom not to talk to me on the phone. </p><p>I went to a bond hearing with him and he didn't really fight to get me a bond at all and he knew I was innocent. Back then I didn't realize what was going on, but now I know they were listening to my phone calls between me and my mom. The DA on my case was crooked and Mr. Farmer told me as much. The DA knew I wouldn't go to trial because Mr. Farmer told me they can give me a life sentence with no proof and no evidence -- they do whatever they want. I told my mom everything he said to me over those phones and they rail-roaded me with it.</p><p><b>Mr. Farmer told me the DA said he had no evidence on me and didn't want to give me a life sentence, but if I went to trial he would make me look guilty by association and that is illegal, but he could do it. Mr. Farmer didn't know why they were doing this to me, but I did. They knew me and my mom would fight this to the end. </b></p><p>So Mr. Farmer started trying to get proof to prove my innocence and he did. He talked to Will and found out that Victor was the person that called him. I took a drug test two days before April 14. He was able to get that to prove that I don't smoke. Phalecia was going to testify to the fact that none of the thing Victor said happened in the apartment happened. Donald was going to testify as well. Karl was willing to help, but didn't remember everything, so Mr. Farmer said we couldn't use him. He got the statement from Glen and he talked to him and he said him being an outside witness couldn't help. He never tried to get the recording from the jail. He did talk to Victor and he lied about something different every time. Mr. Farm realized Victor didn't remember his lies. He also talked to Willy and he told Mr. Farmer he would help me, but the DA gave him a five year plea to testify against me and he said okay, after already giving three statements saying I had nothing to do with it.</p><p>I didn't see the tape, but Mr. Farmer said it is clear to see that his lawyer and the DA made him do it, or he was looking at life. At this point they had lies from Victor and now Willy, which could have been proven without trial. But Mr. Farmer didn't file the motions to discredit them, which would have been easy because they both gave more than one statement. He couldn't talk to Gene because he didn't take a plea yet.</p><p>The week before I went to court, Mr. Farmer told me that the DA was offering ten years. I told him no way. I had nothing to do with it and that's just not fair. I understood they were going to make me take some type of charge, because if they didn't they knew my mom was going to sue them for what they did. We also talked about that over the phone. Mr. Farmer said he was going to try to get me five years, which I still didn't understand. But he told me I would only do 18 months. When Mr. Farmer came back, he said fifteen years -- five in jail with time served. I asked him was there a way I could talk to the judge before I did this to get my side out and let them hear the truth and what was being done. He said yes.</p><p>I told my mom this over the phone as well. I told her I felt like Mr. Farmer was trying to take me to trial because he didn't like the prosecutor. When I went to court, I thought I was going to talk to the judge, but when I got there Mr. Farmer told me he wasn't in the best of moods and the DA told him if I tried to talk to the judge he would take the plea off the table. Mr. Farmer went on to say that he was sorry and didn't know why they were doing me this way. He asked me if I was a citizen and if he did a good job. He also asked me if I wanted to pick a jury and I told him no. </p><p>I asked if there was anything else I could do and he told me no. Then he had me sign the plea paper and we went in the court room. I took a best interest plea, letting the court know that I was not guilty of any of the charges and that I was being framed by mo co-defendant. The prosecutor told the judge lies and statements that he had Willy take a plea on to make me look guilty. The judge gave me first offenders and fifteen years. </p><p>Now at the time, I didn't know there was a difference between fifteen, do five and fifteen. I thought the judge was saying the overall sentence and the jail took care of the rest. Mr. Farmer made me think I understood what was going on, and I thought I did, but he misinformed me about a lot of things.</p><p>First was the plea, Mr. Farmer told me fifteen, do five, not fifteen. I would have never signed the plea for fifteen years, knowing that I had nothing to do with what happened. I signed my life away for nothing. Another thing he told me was it would be easy for me to get legal help after I take the plea and appeal it, but he never told me my appeal options or the time span I had to do it in.</p><p>I have my transcript from that court date and Mr. Farmer never said anything to the judge about me talking with him, nor did he say anything to the DA. I tried to reach Mr. Farmer via phone and mail after that court date and I have still not received a reply from the multiple attempts my family and I have made to reach him.</p><p>Two weeks after that court date I retained a private attorney by the name of Mr. Williams. Mr. Williams came to see me after my mom and Donald paid him and sent him my discovery pack. I told him what happened and he seemed like he was going to help me, but the thing was, he was Willy's lawyer on that case. After I told him the story, he told me that he was his lawyer and I told him that he must know what I'm talking about then. I asked him why did Willy lie on me and he told me it was because he advised him to. At the same time, Mr. Williams told me that Willy told him I had nothing to do with it.

In his dealings with the justice system, he found nothing but injustice. His only chance to receive justice is to appeal his case. This is a costly expense, however, when murder is involved. We need your help obtaining an appellate attorney so that James can get the trial he deserves. He is innocent of the crime for which he has been charged. The attorneys we have spoken with are asking for $25K up front and potentially additional charges.Whatever you can spare, we will be more than grateful for. Please donate and share even if you can't donate. Everything counts. This is James's account of the incident and the proceedings thereafter:""This is a detailed recap of the events which place on April 14, 2012 (ultimately resulting in my arrest) to date in reference to the criminal case. I certify and attest all statements are true and acurate to the best of my knowledge.On the evening of April 14, 2012, I was invited by Victor Scott to his apartment for a barbeque. Vick, at this time, resided with a guy named Mike. I only know Vick because he recently dated my roommate, Veronica. Vick was often at my apartment, so frequently that he basically lived with us. A week prior to the events mentioned here, Vick and Veronica ended their relationship. As a result, Vick moved in with Mike.Upon arriving at Mike and Vick's apartment, I encountered a total of five individuals: Mike, his wife, Vick and two guys I did not know (I found later to be named Gene and Jeremy). I asked Vick about the barbeque and he stated that he never told me about a barbeque. Gene and the other guy laughed as if an inside joke existed. Realizing the barbeque was not going to take place, I asked Vick if I could borrow his phone to call Phalecia, since mine was off. He said yes and I called her, asking her to order pizza because Victor was not having a barbeque. She was upset because I should have gone to the store, rather than being lazy, and now we had to waste money on pizza.She told me to make sure I was back at the apartment when the pizza arrived because she was on her way home from work (via public transportation) and didn't know if she would be there in time. After hanging up and giving Victor his phone back he asked me if I knew anyone with some weed. I told him 'not really, only Will.'Will is a mutual friend of mine and Victor and is actually the person that introduced Victor to Veronica. Will was my roommate in college. That's how we met and we have been friends ever since. Victor called him and asked him if he had some weed and Will told him yes, but he didn't know if he could get a ride to bring it to Victor, so he would have to call him back and let him know. While Victor waited, he was calling other people because Will is known for standing people up. While victor was calling other people, Phalecia called back to tell me she ordered the pizza and to head home. I gave Victor his phone back and told him I was leaving. I still needed to walk to the store and make it home to get the pizza. Victor asked me if I would wait for him. He wanted to walk with me but wanted to let his phone charge up a bit. I agreed.While we were waiting, he started asking me about Veronica and if she was talking about him since he had been gone. I told him I hadn't really talked to her. He asked if I thought she would talk to him and I said yes. So he started calling her while his phone was plugged in. A few minutes went by and another guy came over that I've never seen before. He asked Victor if he had some weed. Victor told him no, but that he was about to get some. He told the guy to give him his money and he would bring it to him when he got it. At this point, I could see what was going on, but I don't smoke or sell weed, so I wasn't concerned with what he was doing. I was just ready to go. Since Victor was still using his phone and there was no way it was charging, I told him again I had to go. He said okay and then he came with me, along with Gene and Jeremy. Everything looked normal. Gene and Jeremy had Nike sports bags on their backs with what I thought was clothes in them because I heard them say they had stayed over the night before. As we were walking to the store, Victor was still calling people trying to get weed. He either called Will back or Will called him and Victor asked if Will knew someone else that he could get some weed from Will texted him someone's number, but when this happened I didn't know it. Victor told me Will found a ride and would meet him in front of my apartment complex. He didn't really say anything else about weed after that. Victor was on the phone with some female I didn't know. We made it to the store and on the way back Victor told me that the female was going to come pick them up. Gene was on the phone as well on the way back but I don't know him, so I wasn't walking close enough to know what he was talking about, nor do I remember him saying anything about weed. I remember Gene talking about going to some girl's house and Jeremy saying he had to get home because his dad was mean and he didn't want to get in trouble. Victor told me after Will met him in front of my apartment that the girl was going to pick them up from there, too. As we were walking into the entrance of the complex, Willy pulled up. I know Willy from school six years before. We lived in the same apartment complex -- the same place that I lied with Will in student housing. Will knew Willy as well. Originally when Willy pulled up, I thought he saw me walking and was stopping to say hello. I walked up to the car where Willy was sitting in the passenger seat. I didn't know the driver. Willy and I talked for a minute, just catching up, because it had been a while since we had seen each other. After or quick catch up, Willy asked me if I called him for some weed. I told him no, that I don't smoke anymore. I stopped about a year and a half ago for a better job. He then told me someone had called him from the complex and I told him it wasn't me. I didn't even have his number anymore. He said okay and I told him I had to get home to get the pizza. I walked back to the sidewalk and told Victor I would see him later and I walked in the gate and went to my apartment. As I was walking away I saw Victor walk up to Willy's car, but I don't know what was said. Then I saw Gene and Jeremy get in the backseat.Victor ran up to me after I was in the gate. He was still on the phone. When we reached the first building and parking lot, Victor stopped and I kept walking home. I didn't introduce Willy and Victor or anyone else. I didn't tell Willy that Victor was looking for weed because Victor said Will was coming. And that's the same reason I didn't tell Victor that Willy sold. I wasn't thinking about it. I was just trying to get home to get the pizza because I didn't know if Phalecia had made it home yet.I walked past my neighbor, Karl, on the way to the apartment and I told him I needed to talk to him. At the the time, he was on the way to the dumpster. I told him I would come by his apartment after I ate.When I got home, Phalecia was there and she had the pizza already. I went to the bathroom and then I went to get a plate of pizza. We ate together in the living room while watching TV. The show was Criminal Minds and I know this because at that time of night, we watched this show almost every night. When a commercial came on I went to take the plate in the kitchen and she went to the bathroom.Victor, Gene, and Jeremy were knocking on the door. I opened it and Victor asked me if I could let his friend use the bathroom. I led Jeremy to Veronica's bathroom and I stayed in Veronica's room while he was in there. While I was in the room waiting for Jeremy, I heard Victor in the kitchen and I saw Gene standing in the middle of the room, changing his shoes and his shirt. Gene put on some new shoes and a nice shirt. I was thinking he was getting ready to go to the girls house he had been talking about earlier. I also heard Victor and Gene talking, but it was hard to make out what was being said over the TV. But I remember feeling funny because it was like they were whispering or something. I figured it had nothing to do with me, so I ignored it. When Jeremy came out of the bathroom, Victor asked me if I had some sandwich bags and I told him where they were. He grabbed a few bags. On the table there were three phones, two black phones and one red. Gene put all of them in his back pack. Victor had his phone plugged in the wall and it rang as they were standing there. He answered it and told the girl that was coming to get them to meet them at the mail box. I sat back own on the couch and got back into the show. Victor told me they were about to go. I said okay and that I was about to head out, too. I was going to go upstairs to talk to Karl. I went to grab Phalecia's phone and they left. I told her I would call her when I got to the grocery store.Victor, Gene, and Jeremy were at my apartment for ten minutes or less. They didn't give me anything, nor did I take anything from them and they didn't tell me what they had done, nor did they act funny other than Victor and Gene whispering. I didn't see how much weed they had, nor did I see a gun. I did not become aware that they had a gun until later.When I walked outside, they were gone. Karl was standing in the parking lot. I asked him if he could give me a ride to the grocery store and he said yes. As we were standing there a lot of cops came driving fast past us and drove back out of the parking lot the way they came in. Karl and I were wondering what was going on, so we walked the way the cops went to see. The street was roped off, making everyone come park in our building's parking lot.As we were standing there, other neighbors were talking about what happened. They were saying someone was shot and car jacked by some black dudes. Others were saying it was a drug deal gone bad. Karl and I spoke to a cop and he told us it looked like a drug deal gone bad, so we said okay.Phalecia called her cell phone that I had from an unsaved number. The first time she called, I didn't answer, but when she called back, I picked it up. She told me Victor, Gene, and Jeremy were back at the apartment and she wasn't letting them in. I walked home to find Victor, Gene and Jeremy outside the door. I asked Victor what happened, as I was opening the door and his phone rang. It was his ride. She was waiting for him, so I locked the door back without opening it and walked with them to the car. I walked back over to Karl and that's when I heard all the different stories from the neighbors. When Victor left, I knew he had to drive through the area that was roped off, so out of concern I called him to make sure they didn't have any problems leaving. I don't remember how the phone call went, but I know called him on his phone and he didn't pick up, so I called the number Phalecia called me from when they were at the apartment. Victor picked up.I asked if everything was okay. He said yes. I asked if he saw what happened when he went outside coming to the apartment. He said no and that he had to go and then he hung up. I told Karl that I thought I knew who did this. He told me not to say anything for a number of reasons. This was the story I told the police at our first encounter, but the truth is, when Gene and Victor were whispering in my apartment while I was in Veronica's bedroom, I did hear them. I heard Victor ask Gene why he shot them and took their stuff and Gene said because they didn't need it. At that point I was scared for my life and Phalecia's life. I didn't know how bad it was, but I knew something happened and I didn't want to let them know that I knew because, like I said, they were whispering so that I couldn't hear them and I knew I was the only one that knew they were with Willy. When I told Karl what I heard and what I thought happened, he asked me if I knew their names. At the time, I didn't. The only person's name I knew was Victor and I only knew his first name. I didn't even know Willy's full name at that point. All I could think of was that they knew were I lived and I knew nothing about them. I figured if I said anything to the police, they would know it was me, since I was the only one who knew they were with Willy, and they would come to kill me and Phalecia, or send someone else to do it.I really called Victor when they left, not out of concern, but to make him think I didn't know what they did, so he wouldn't come after me. I called Will to ask him if me and Phalecia could come stay with him for a little while. I told Will what happened, thinking that he gave Victor Willy's number, but I found out later that he didn't. It was someone else's number. I wanted to leave that night, but Karl told me not panic and that they wouldn't be back. Mentally, though, I was still panicking. I had never been around something like that to know what would happen next or what to do. I wanted to do whatever I could to help Willy, but at the same time, I was thinking about the lives of Veronica, Phalecia, and me. I called my best friend, Donald, but he told me to call him back, so I called my brother in Texas, Bernard, and told him what happened.I let him know if something were to happen to me or Phalecia, that Veronica's boyfriend Victor would be behind it. And he also told me to stay out of it. Two days later I walked to the store and on the way back I stopped by Mike's apartment to make sure Victor thought I didn't know anything. I asked him if he heard about what happened that night. He said no and asked me what happened. I told him the neighbors said someone was shot. He then changed the subject and asked me if his probation officer called me. I asked why they would be calling me. I didn't even know he was on probation. Then he said if they didn't call, not to worry about it. I said okay and then I left because I was meeting up with Phalecia at the bus stop to walk home with her. I was trying to be as safe as I could because I didn't know what Victor and his friends were thinking, but I tried to stay friendly so he wouldn't think I was acting suspicious. In my first encounters with the police, I told the cops that I went over there to get some weed from him for a friend, so I wouldn't have to tell them I knew what he did up until that point. Then I told the cops I knew Victor had something to do with it when he asked me about his probation officer.When I got to the bus stop, I told Phalecia we needed to stay away from him. We thought about reaching out to Willy to assure him that I had nothing to do with it and let him know that I was just walking from the store with them, but we also didn't want to make him think I had something to do with it. Willy had known me for six or seven years and we never had a problem with each other. He knows that I'm not the type of person to be in anything like this. I don't live my life like that at all and I don't hang with people that do, knowingly. That was Monday.Two days later, Phalecia and I were sitting on the bed and saw about four cops with dogs in the woods outside our bedroom window. They were so close we could hear what they were saying. At first we were thinking they were just checking because of what happened over the weekend, but as we sat there we saw them pull the cell phones out of the woods that Victor and Gene had on the table when they came over, two black, one red. Then we heard the cops say my name and that's when we started panicking. Phalecia told me to go to check the bathroom Jeremy had been in. The trash and everything just to make sure nothing was in the house where they had been. She told me right then that Victor had to be framing me because he is the only person that knew my name and he had those phones when he came over that Saturday. Why else would the cops search there when the incident took place two buildings before ours?I listened to what she was saying and it made good sense, so I got mad and called Victor and asked him why the cops were outside my window with the phones I saw them with and saying my name like I was a suspect. Victor told me it was okay, that I wasn't in trouble. He just told the police that they came to my apartment after they got the weed. I asked him why he would say anything about me at all. He came there because it was his girlfriend's apartment and his friend needed to use the bathroom. I hung up on him.At that point I was scared and going crazy. I didn't know what to do. I wanted to go outside and tell the cops, but I knew if I did Victor would come shoot the apartment up. Then, on the other hand, I didn't know what the cops were going to do. I just knew they called me a suspect.I called Donald, my best friend, he works with cops and has cop friends and his neighbor is a friend of ours and a cop, so I was hoping he could get some help but no one was home at the time. Donald asked me what Victor said and I told him. He told me to call him back to make sure he didn't try to set me up. So I did. I called Victor back on three way with Donald on the phone and I asked him what all he said to the police about me.Victor told me that he told the police that I told him to call Will and they came to my apartment. He also told them what he needed to get off probation. I hung up on him again. Donald told me it wasn't against the law to tell someone to call someone and if they did something without me being there or knowing about it then I had nothing to worry about. If Victor and his friends were framing me, they would have to prove what was being said.Donald then told me I had nothing to worry about and I should talk to the cops so they don't think I have something to hide, so I said okay. On Thursday, the cops called Phalecia's phone while she was at work and asked her a few questions. She told them I was home when they came over on Saturday, but the cops didn't keep her conversation on record, so it's like that never happened. When she came home I called the cop. He asked me where I lived and I told him. He asked me if I would come speak with him to ID some photos. I agreed. I was cooking, so I asked him if it was okay if I came when I was done. He agreed. The cop then called me back about thirty minutes later and asked if I was still coming. I told him that I would me there in fifteen minutes, and I was.When I got there we shook hands and he put me in hand cuffs, emptied my pockets, read me my rights, took me in a room, and asked me if I knew the people on the photos. It was Victor and Gene. I told him Victor was my roommate's boyfriend and Gene was his friend, but I didn't know him or his name. I met him Saturday night and we didn't really talk to each other. I asked him if I was under arrest and he said we would get to that after I told him what happened. I told him the story without telling him I heard them talking and without telling him why I went to Victor's on Monday. I told the cop a story that I assumed would keep me, my family, and Phalecia safe, but at the same time, let him know that I saw them with Willy.I never accused Victor, Gene, and Jeremy of anything because I didn't see it with my own eyes, nor did I want the cops to use me by making them think that it was my fault they were in jail or being pursued. That's why I told the cop the story the way I did. I wanted to help Willy but be safe at the same time. I really told him a lot of assumptions other than what I saw. The cop tried to put words in my mouth about making the phone call to set the drug deal up, but I told him that I didn't call anyone but my girl. I don't smoke or sell, so I wasn't calling anyone for weed. The cop sensed me shutting down, so he went to get a recording of him talking on the phone with Victor and he played it.Victor told the officer that we were together all day trying to rob people so he could get money to pay his rent, that some guy owed him money and we were going to rob him as well. He told the cop that I called Will and set the drug deal up, that I was there when they robbed Willy and when the gun went off we said to each other 'I hope he didn't shoot them', before I took off running. Then he said I let them hide in my apartment where I gave him a bucket of water to put the phones in. Then he said I gave him a shoe box to put the gun in. He told the cop that I took the phones and put them in the woods and he gave me some of the weed he took. He went on to say that I told him to put the gun in a lake in my so called shoe box. I broke down and told the cop that he was framing me and all of that was a lie and that I could prove it but the cop didn't care. After that phone call between Victor and the cop, Victor called back 15 minutes later and told the cop he was lying and that I didn't know about what happened. The cop said he was lying and trying to save me because I was scared. I had all types of proof when this first happened, but I sat in the county jail without any help or a lawyer for seven to eight months. My first time in court Phalecia came and told them I was being framed and she had a text from Victor to prove it. He texted her telling me to just 'go tell them the truth and I should be fine.' That was five days after he called the cops and framed me. But because it was my first appearance in court, they said there was nothing they could do and I had to wait to go before the judge.I went to court a number of times before I went in front of a judge, but one of the trips to the courthouse I was on the bus with Gene and he told me what he did and that they were going to rob me. That's why Victor told me he was having a barbeque. It was to get me out of the house. Gene and Jeremy were supposed to go rob the apartment, but their ride didn't come to take them. He also told me how the story they were going to tell about what happened was to set me up because Victor knew I had a clean record and thought they would never prosecute me. Now the bus has a camera on it and he said everything out loud so everyone could hear him. It was like he was bragging about it. At this point that tape may not even exist anymore. I don't know. I don't know how to retrieve it for evidence. He didn't like what Victor was doing to me and he said he would tell his public defender what was going on. On this bus, there was a guy that was in the same dorm as me, named  Glen. He heard everything that Gene said and Glen wrote a statement and gave it to me when we got back to the jail, letting it be known that he heard the murderer say I knew nothing and was being framed. On the way back from the court house, I was with Willy on the bus and in the holding cell. Glen was there as well. He heard Willy tell me he knew I had nothing to do with it and he watched me go home. Willy also told me he would do whatever to help me because he knows I didn't call him and I wouldn't do anything like that. After this, I told my mom to call the DA and have him come talk to me, but she was advised not to do that. When Victor got locked up he put a hit out on me through his gang, and I know this because the person he told ended up in a holding cell with me at the court house and I prayed for him before he went to court.He asked me what happened and I told him and he said he could tell I didn't belong there. He told me Victor put a hit out on me through him and he was going to try to call it off, but that Victor knew how the system works and he knew he could help himself by putting me in it. Apparently he did it before to someone else to get off his last case. The guy told me Victor thought I was going to run to the cops when I figured out what he did, so he told the cops a story first so they wouldn't listen to me. He said Victor knew I was lame and didn't know anything about anything, so I was easy to frame. I had a roommate that came from Victor's dorm for one  day and we got to talking about our cases. He told me that he had just left Victor's dorm and that he talks about me and Phalecia all the time. This man I had never seen before told me my case and that I was being framed because Victor felt like I was stupid. He said I was always at work while Phalecia was at home doing whatever and Victor was trying to take her from me. He said Phalecia's name, and that's how I knew he was telling the truth. I don't talk about her to anyone.When I finally went in front of the judge, I had a court lawyer that talked to me for five minutes before we went in. I told her what I could in that time. When the cop took the stand he said what Victor told him over the phone. He also said that Willy told him I didn't call him -- that the person who robbed him was the person who called him. Willy told them I was not there at all and I didn't even know he was called. The cop said he was waiting for finger prints and phone records to link me to anything, but at that time all he had was what Victor said and the fact that Gene's phone called Phalecia's phone and vice versa. It was the unsaved number Phalecia called me from when they came back to the house and she didn't let them in.It also came out that she didn't let them in because it was just Gene and Jeremy standing there and we don't know them. At that time Victor was putting the phones in the woods. But the cop didn't say that part or the part about how the shoe box was a female shoe box. He also didn't say how there were ten eye witnesses and none of them said anything about me. There was a man sitting in his car in the parking space right next to them, watching the whole thing, plus, some people on their balconies looking over the whole parking lot. The cop had no evidence on me at all, but Victor's lies. My public defender made it very clear that I was not a criminal based off my record.Everyone was denied bond because of their records. When they got to me they saw I had no record, then the man on the side with the laptop, who I think became the prosecutor on the case, said nothing was showing up but one screen was locked. So my court attorney asked me if I ever had any charges. I told her I got a ticket five years ago for driving without a license. She smiled and told the judge I never had any criminal charges. The judge denied bond for no reason. She told me she would give me one in two weeks when we came back to see her, but that never happened.Next, they got the finger prints back and mine were not on anything. The phone calls were how I said they were. They tried to indict me alone, but they didn't have any evidence and they were turned down. So they indicted me with everyone else and gave me nineteen charges: murder, seven counts of felony murder, hijacking a motor vehicle, two counts of armed robbery, two counts aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, criminal attempt to commit violation of Georgia controlled substances act, conspiracy to commit violation of the Georgia controlled substances act, two counts of possession of a firearm during commission of a felony, possession of a firearm by first offender probationer, and tampering with evidence.When I did get a public defender in November, he told me they were able to do that because I knew Victor and Willy were together. His name was Mr. Farmer, but I had another public defender before Mr. Farmer for two weeks. I called him on the jail phones and he told me to try to get statements from my co-defendants to prove my innocence. I knew if I did that, he couldn't use it, so I called my mom and told her was I was told to do. The next week I was assigned to the director, Mr. Francis.When I spoke with Mr. Francis, I could tell something funny was going on, but I didn't know what. He told me they had nothing and that's all he really said. After that he just kept telling me don't talk on the phones and he told my mom not to talk to me on the phone. I went to a bond hearing with him and he didn't really fight to get me a bond at all and he knew I was innocent. Back then I didn't realize what was going on, but now I know they were listening to my phone calls between me and my mom. The DA on my case was crooked and Mr. Farmer told me as much. The DA knew I wouldn't go to trial because Mr. Farmer told me they can give me a life sentence with no proof and no evidence -- they do whatever they want. I told my mom everything he said to me over those phones and they rail-roaded me with it.Mr. Farmer told me the DA said he had no evidence on me and didn't want to give me a life sentence, but if I went to trial he would make me look guilty by association and that is illegal, but he could do it. Mr. Farmer didn't know why they were doing this to me, but I did. They knew me and my mom would fight this to the end. So Mr. Farmer started trying to get proof to prove my innocence and he did. He talked to Will and found out that Victor was the person that called him. I took a drug test two days before April 14. He was able to get that to prove that I don't smoke. Phalecia was going to testify to the fact that none of the thing Victor said happened in the apartment happened. Donald was going to testify as well. Karl was willing to help, but didn't remember everything, so Mr. Farmer said we couldn't use him. He got the statement from Glen and he talked to him and he said him being an outside witness couldn't help. He never tried to get the recording from the jail. He did talk to Victor and he lied about something different every time. Mr. Farm realized Victor didn't remember his lies. He also talked to Willy and he told Mr. Farmer he would help me, but the DA gave him a five year plea to testify against me and he said okay, after already giving three statements saying I had nothing to do with it.I didn't see the tape, but Mr. Farmer said it is clear to see that his lawyer and the DA made him do it, or he was looking at life. At this point they had lies from Victor and now Willy, which could have been proven without trial. But Mr. Farmer didn't file the motions to discredit them, which would have been easy because they both gave more than one statement. He couldn't talk to Gene because he didn't take a plea yet.The week before I went to court, Mr. Farmer told me that the DA was offering ten years. I told him no way. I had nothing to do with it and that's just not fair. I understood they were going to make me take some type of charge, because if they didn't they knew my mom was going to sue them for what they did. We also talked about that over the phone. Mr. Farmer said he was going to try to get me five years, which I still didn't understand. But he told me I would only do 18 months. When Mr. Farmer came back, he said fifteen years -- five in jail with time served. I asked him was there a way I could talk to the judge before I did this to get my side out and let them hear the truth and what was being done. He said yes.I told my mom this over the phone as well. I told her I felt like Mr. Farmer was trying to take me to trial because he didn't like the prosecutor. When I went to court, I thought I was going to talk to the judge, but when I got there Mr. Farmer told me he wasn't in the best of moods and the DA told him if I tried to talk to the judge he would take the plea off the table. Mr. Farmer went on to say that he was sorry and didn't know why they were doing me this way. He asked me if I was a citizen and if he did a good job. He also asked me if I wanted to pick a jury and I told him no. I asked if there was anything else I could do and he told me no. Then he had me sign the plea paper and we went in the court room. I took a best interest plea, letting the court know that I was not guilty of any of the charges and that I was being framed by mo co-defendant. The prosecutor told the judge lies and statements that he had Willy take a plea on to make me look guilty. The judge gave me first offenders and fifteen years. Now at the time, I didn't know there was a difference between fifteen, do five and fifteen. I thought the judge was saying the overall sentence and the jail took care of the rest. Mr. Farmer made me think I understood what was going on, and I thought I did, but he misinformed me about a lot of things.First was the plea, Mr. Farmer told me fifteen, do five, not fifteen. I would have never signed the plea for fifteen years, knowing that I had nothing to do with what happened. I signed my life away for nothing. Another thing he told me was it would be easy for me to get legal help after I take the plea and appeal it, but he never told me my appeal options or the time span I had to do it in.I have my transcript from that court date and Mr. Farmer never said anything to the judge about me talking with him, nor did he say anything to the DA. I tried to reach Mr. Farmer via phone and mail after that court date and I have still not received a reply from the multiple attempts my family and I have made to reach him.Two weeks after that court date I retained a private attorney by the name of Mr. Williams. Mr. Williams came to see me after my mom and Donald paid him and sent him my discovery pack. I told him what happened and he seemed like he was going to help me, but the thing was, he was Willy's lawyer on that case. After I told him the story, he told me that he was his lawyer and I told him that he must know what I'm talking about then. I asked him why did Willy lie on me and he told me it was because he advised him to. At the same time, Mr. Williams told me that Willy told him I had nothing to do with it. If I used his help, he would not be able to make Willy contradict himself because that would be a conflict of interest. The next time he came to see me he told me he called the BAR and they said he would not be able to help. So he tried to tell me he would turn the case over to a friend of his for five thousand more. I said okay and he left. He never gave my money back. When I got to Jackson, I was there with Gene. He told me that he told his lawyer, but his lawyer was not trying to help him at all. He also told me had no problem telling the truth to help me. He told some random people that I was framed while we were at Jackson and I still talk to one guy. He is willing to help me as well.When I went to the counselor at Jackson, she told me I was close security because of my charge and my sentence. She told me I had a murder charge and 25 years. I told her that was wrong. She told me to write her and she would look into it, so that's what I did. She didn't fix anything.  I also wrote the head counselor and told him what was going on. And no one did anything. So I was sent to the worst prison in Georgia.When I got to Hays State Prison, I talked to a counselor that told me I shouldn't be here. The counselor at Jackson was supposed to fix my paperwork, but she was being lazy, so it got fixed here. My first day here, I overheard some guys saying they were going to get me and Gene, so I went into PC to be on the safe side. I had someone check for me to see if Gene was here and he was, so I've stayed in PC so I don't get killed. I didn't know anyone but the people I met along the way. I tend to stay to myself in my cell.I'm on 24 hour lockdown, but I'm safe. It's a hard situation to deal with knowing that life will never be back the way it was, but so far God has been holding my hand and I pray he doesn't let go.""Thank you for your time and your donations. For more information, please email chelsearmetcalf@gmail.com.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>My wish is to contribute with animal welfare and do anything I can to help these vulnerable and innocent animals. I have visited Cat Cafe's up and down the country and witnessed the difference they make. Bringing one to Southampton will continue the help and support these cafe's do by raising awareness for cats in need.</p>
<p>Paws For Thought Cat Café is solely in the interest of the cats; creating awareness, helping local re-homing and rescue centres, providing information on the adoption process, whilst creating a  forever home for our resident cats.</p>
<p>I am personally an owner of a rescue cat who we named Bree.... (not to be confused with the cheese!) She is the most precious little girl who was looking for her forever home after a bad start in life, being kept in a shed as a kitten which broke my heart to hear. I've seen Bree change from being scared and nervous of people, to now being a beautiful affectionate cat that loves nothing more than a tummy tickle and fuss. I want to bring this change and happiness to as many cats as possible and we can do that together by raising the money to open our very own cat cafe in Southampton.</p>
<h3>Whats a Cat Cafe?</h3>
<p>Its a place where you can come to relax, catch up with friends or just take an hour away from your busy day to enjoy a hot or cold drink and some delicious food whilst being in the company of our beautiful rescue cats. It as simple as that! </p>
<p>The cafe will be booking only and not a walk in café. This is to ensure control of who is coming in and out of the café at all times for the safety of the cats. However, you're more than welcome to phone the cafe and check for available slots on the day if you are passing by.</p>
<p>A small cover charge for the care and wellbeing of the cats will be included within the bill. Reasonably priced quality food and drinks menu will be available to all guests.</p>
<p>At Paws For Thought we want to bring a Cat Café with a difference. A place to share your stories and show us the cats you have in your lives. As a owner I know how much happiness these kitties can bring but also the pain of losing one, Paws For Thought will offer support on bereavement of pets. We will create a space in the cafe for you to come and share your stories or photos of past and present pets for everyone to see.</p>
<h3>What we are asking of you!</h3>
<p>Your donation will help us bring this cat café to Southampton, a place to create and promote animal welfare, pet bereavement, re homing and volunteering projects.</p>
<p>Our £25,000 target will create this home/sanctuary for our rescue cats:</p>
<p>We are currently looking for a suitable premises for our cats home and café. Once secured your donations will help us to start our journey to opening the doors to the first cat cafe in Southampton. </p>
<p>We will keep everyone updated throughout this Campaign from the moment we find our home, throughout the refurbishment, finding and introducing our new resident cats, right through to opening our doors to you.</p>
<p><strong>The £25,000 will help with -</strong></p>
<p><strong>Decorating - </strong>the premises will require enough exercise and play equipment for the cats along with high up areas and hiding places for them to escape to if they wish. They will require their own areas for when they don't feel sociable including their cat-care room as well as making a space only they can have individual access to.</p>
<p><strong>Healthcare - </strong>All of the cats will require ongoing healthcare including vaccinations, treatments, medications and micro-chipping. We will also require animal behaviourists to work with us in making sure the cats are completely happy and the five freedoms of the Animal Welfare Act 2006 are met in their entirety.</p>
<p><strong>Refurbishing - </strong>As well as making the cafe a purrfect place for our resident cats, we need to make a comfy and welcoming place for you to visit. </p>
<p>A layout that makes it as comfortable for you as well as the cats and this means creating lots of separate areas within the cafe. One of our main concerns is having a place the food and drink can be stored and prepared away from the cats, so your food and drink arrives purrfectly and cat hair free!</p>
<p>We will also need to install air-conditioning, air purifiers, ventilation and temperate control, so the cats and you are comfortable at all times.</p>
<p><strong>What we will do in return for your generosity -</strong> </p>
<p>We are hugely grateful for any donations received and as a thank you for your support, every donator will be named on the cafes personal 'thank you' wall for everyone to see. However, should you wish to donate £25.00 or more we thought of a few extra thank you's to show our appreciation  -</p>

<p>My newly launched organic candle is a result of not finding a rich chocolate scented candle that was not ""musky"" or not chocolaty enough. I customized a scent with longtime friend Maria Murphy at Soy Spacasso, who is manufacture of organic home products and skin care. We achieved the most perfect and seductive natural chocolate candle I ever smelled. With 4 years in the talks, the idea materialized late this past summer 2016 to join forces to launch a line of special organic candles. </p>
<p>As a natural creative I pushed limits and sampled scents for months to achieve the perfect chocolate candle, with the optimal notes of raspberry in beautiful and minimalist eco-friendly container. I am not a fan of strong scents and the perfumes found in many expensive candles, and wanted to develop a collection that was unique and free of those elements, natural and affordable.</p>
<p>CREATIVE No.1 is the first of my new CREATIVE by AR Waters collection, the first of many rich, custom organic aromas created from 100% vegan soy, inspired by natural ingredients you’d find in your kitchen. </p>
<p>CREATIVE stands out from the rest because each scent is a custom process and  big deal, launching only twice a year, and kept secret until revealed the twice-a-year launch party for each scent. The launch is an expected to be an experience for the 5 senses, an unforgettable introduction; themed visuals are present with food and drink served to be inspired by the scent.</p>
<p>It is now time to get the word out about my latest creative venture, and that’s where you come in! I want everyone to experience CREATIVE No.1 by AR Waters.</p>

<p>By funding CREATIVE No.1 you help with the marketing efforts to kick off the first scent and with holiday production. The perks are excellent, they make for easy gift giving during the holidays and everyone gets rewarded. All backers receive free shipping in the USA for their orders. </p>

</li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>This project has been changing women's lives around the world. I get emails daily from women and girls about the positive impact A Beautiful Project and the book ""The Bodies Of Mothers"" has had on them! So many women feel alone and unsupported as they deal with their bodies changing, going through pregnancy, post-partum, miscarriages, eating disorders, depression, weight gain, weight loss, cancer, illness, accidents, and A Beautiful Body Project has been a life-line for 10,000's of thousands of women around the world. <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>I have already come this far on a very tight budget and am surrounded by a talented team of web designers, videographers, photographers, writers, and editors. I guess there is some risk this could completely flop but to be honest, I think the worst risk is maybe the website won't be exactly to your liking, and maybe we won't get a regional photographer in every major city around the world. But I believe in my heart these risks are pretty low given the talent and work ethic of the people around me. <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>There are so many ways you can contribute even if funds are tight at the moment: <br/><ul>
<li>WORD OF MOUTH!!!!!! Tell your friends and family and co-workers about this amazing project!</li>
<li>Post this fundraiser onto your social media pages like Facebook and say why you believe in this project. I can't tell you how much that would mean to me! <br/>
</li>
<li>Share this fundraiser in an email or newsletter to your friends and family!! </li>
<li>Post comments onto THIS fundraiser page which helps this fundraiser rise up Indigogo's pages and get seen by more people. That is HUGE! <br/>
</li>
<li>Even a $1 donation helps because it makes it more likely the fundraiser will move up Indiegogo's pages! The more action on this fundraiser the better! Seriously it makes a difference!!! <br/>
</li>
<li>Send out positive vibes to help us take this to the next level! </li>

Find me on Facebook and Instagram and find A Beautiful Body Project across social media platforms too to stay involved!!! <br/></p><p>Together we are changing the media world!<br/></p><p>Thank you, -Jade Beall<br/></p></div>","Introduction:
I am on a mission to create the largest source for recorded women's voices in the world telling their stories of their bodies and their lives via unaltered images, videos, podcasts, and written pieces covering our shared experiences through birth, aging, cancer, miscarriage, loss, eating disorders, and beyond. Women are so resilient and yet so many of us feel so alone. 24 photographers and videographers in 7 countries  have already joined me and ~200 more have applied! 

Become an original donor of the official Non-Profit Organization for A Beautiful Body Project! After 2 years of BETA testing, ABeautifulBodyProject.com already has had 1.6 million visitors from 220 countries/territories and 25,000+ cities and towns around the world, so we know the work is reaching people far and wide across the globe. 

***EVERY SUPPORTER who gives $10 & Above will be permanently named on the new website as original Non-Profit Funders! (you can also give anonymously)***

Do you think mass media warps people's sense of body image by using airbrushing and photoshop to change women's bodies in magazine covers, billboards, and beyond, to make breasts bigger, waists smaller, hide wrinkles and pimples, and create false images of women while often objectifying women? Do you think this negatively impacts young girls' sense of self? If you are saying yes to these questions, please read on.

My name is Jade Beall and my work celebrates what many call flaws in women's bodies. It went viral 3 years ago after I posted an unaltered photo of myself with my newborn son. I began photographing women, old and young, mothers and non-mothers, regardless of race, gender, or sexual orientation, simply focusing on women who wanted to see themselves authentically. Ever since I have been hearing from women all over the world how my work is touching their lives but I realized sadly that I can't travel to all these women. By myself, this work will never reach as many as it could! 
Three years ago 1000's of you helped me launch the book ""The Bodies Of Mothers""
 which went viral around the world! Check out the video we made back then that has been watched over 4.1 million times across all media channels:What We Need & What You Get

The current ABEAUTIFULBODYPROJECT.com website has been visited

 by over 1.6 million unique visitors 

in 210+ countries and territories
and 24,000+ cities and towns around the world since  www.ABeautifulBodyProject.com was launched in May 2013! 


Now I am raising funds to: 

Fund the incorporation of the Non-Profit


Hire an editor & assistants to help me expand from 24 regional photographers & videographers in 7 countries who are already on board to at least one in every major city in the world. 

They will be responsible for curating daily content, communicating with the global photographers, editing the stories, putting stories on the website, and posting it to social media. It's a HUGE amount of work! 

The more funds I raise, the more people I will hire to bring this incredible platform to life & to reach millions of people around the world.



Rewards Include
 
Getting named as an original donor on the new revamped website coming soon!

Limited edition archival-quality signed prints
Private photoshoots with me, 

Framed signed prints

Ad-space for like-minded individuals, projects, and companies to gain exposure to the projected-1-million-annual-unique viewers, which is likely to explode in size in the coming months after the launch of the revamped sight! (see website stats above with minimal content being added. We project 1 million unique viewers in the next year)

<p>My name is Dustin LaFont from Houma, Louisiana and I would like to introduce you to Front Yard Bikes.</p>
<p><b>Our Programs:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Front Yard Bikes is a 501(c)3 non-profit that provides community members with cost effective solutions to owning a bike. Our most successful program is Earn-a-Bike. We teach kids ages 6-18 how to fix or rebuild bikes. Through the program, the kids earn the bike of their choosing at a rate of $5 an hour credit. This allows our kids to gain basic mechanic skills and understand the value of their hard work. After fulling the necessary hours, they get to keep their bike free of any charge. Our kids continue to work in our program to earn newer parts for their bikes, repair their bikes, or trade in their old one so they can begin to build a new project bike.</span></p>
<p>Another program we have is Build-a-Bike. In this program, anyone 18 and up and buy a bike frame for $50 and build it up themselves. There is no added cost or expenses. We provide the tools and the know how to help along the way.</p>
<p>We also sell some of our bikes to people of mixed income. Since all of our bikes are donated, we allow community members to donate cash for high quality bikes from a range of $20-$200. So even a person with restricted income can find a affordable bike. In many cases these bikes are used a forms of transportation for jobs and higher education.</p>

<p><b>Our Kids:</b></p>
<p>Our kids come from underserved environments with low income residence. Their is a high volume our theft in our area and bikes are stolen regularly. By providing our services, our kids do not participate in stealing bikes and therefore restrain from other minor theft. Another problem in our community is low job diversity and building bikes at our shop has become a launching platform for future careers. Our kids are hard workers. They are talented, bright shining leaders. They are the future of our community, our city, our state, and even country. They deserve the opportunity to learn, grow, and ride in a safe environment, God willing, we can make that a reality.</p>
<p><b>Our Greatest Need:</b></p>
<p>For the last two years our bike shop has used a warehouse with no electricity, no running water, heating or air cooling. We have holes in the roof that are beyond repair but with rent as low as $300 a month, its the best thing we could ask for. We have reached out to many organizations and we hope to have a partnership soon where we can build an ideal shop for our kids. They deserve this and we owe it to them. If you have the means to help us, please do and thank you.</p>
<p><b>Donation Rewards:</b></p>
<p>For anyone who donates over $50 we will send you a free FYB t-shirt and bike sticker, so you can be a part of our story.</p>
<p>Any person who donates over $100 will receive a free shirt, bike sticker, and car decal.</p>
<p>Any person who donates over $250 will receive a shirt, bike sticker, car decal, and FYB hoodie.</p>
<p>Anyone who donates $500 dollars, will get all of those things and a personal letter of thank you signed by FYB's famous kids.</p>
<p>Anyone who donates $1000 will receive all those things and a customized bike build by our FYB kids.</p>
<p><b>How this will impact our Kids:</b></p>
</div><div> <p>Your impact on our program will last for years to come. With our current shop, our kids have painted it, built the stands, bike racks and picnic benches.

With your help, you will be inspiring our kids to believe in the impossible and grow a faith much greater than our daily problems.</p>
<p><b>Challenges with accomplishing this goal:</b></p>
</div><div> <p>Our greatest challenge is finding a location for our new building that is near where our kids are currently living.

children and I already operate one small consignment store, and we are now
expanding to open a second larger location with the potential for higher
traffic. We've found the space and are looking for backing to help cover some
of the initial costs of rent and utilities, additional staff, and store
fixtures and software upgrades to run two locations. We take items on
consignment: fashionable clothing, furniture, books, textiles, antiques,
vintage, art, jewelry, pottery, and recycle them into the community through our
store. In less than a year of operation, our first shop has done well and has
more than two hundred consignors, despite its out-of-the-way location in a
small town. Our formula for success is straightforward: the community values
our service, we curate our collection carefully, and people living in and
visiting the Berkshires are environmentally conscious and intelligent about
upcycling. My children, ages 14, 12, and 3, and I run the store, and we love
our consignors and customers. We really enjoy being in this business and are
looking forward to expanding our inventory to include more furniture and
household goods in the second store. To build the collection, we're already
working with some estate owners who are liquidating. We're excited to share it
with you. Thanks for considering joining our team and being part of our green
community venture!</p>

<p>We here at Wyldwood Radio are launching this Indiegogo
campaign to raise funds for new equipment to cover events and festivals. We
need your help to make this happen and to greatly improve the radio station and
what we can do.</p>
<p>What we need and what you get:</p>
<p>We need equipment to be able to bring you the best quality
interviews, images and articles from events you want to hear more about but
maybe can’t attend for various reasons. We have had many offers for having a presence
at events but have been unable to attend them due to a lack of transport, not
the best equipment and the cost of public transport working out too high.</p>Our biggest hope from this campaign is to be able to raise
enough to get what we affectionately refer to as the ‘Wyldwood Wagon’; a
suitable car that’s big enough for our equipment, and to carry more than 2
people to events and festivals. It would be amazing to be able to get fully
mobile and make the station more professional and interactive with more
features.<br/><br/>The other equipment we need is as follows:<br/><br/>
<p>A Dictaphone</p>
<p>An SLR camera for stills and video (if possible)</p>
<p>Wyldwood Radio t-shirts for the members of the team so they’re
instantly recognisable</p>
<p>Business cards and various stationery</p>
<p>A suitable laptop, dedicated to the station, which will work with our existing mixing desk and microphone.<br/></p>
<p>Insurance for all of the above.</p>

mobile and make the station more professional and interactive with more

<p>Along with the car, we will also need a good size and
quality tent for staying at events. Depending on the outcome of this
fundraiser, we may be able to get a special ‘add-on’ for the tent which adds an
awning suitable for meetings, interviews and being in the shade/out of the rain
at festivals in the UK and beyond.</p>
<p><b>The impact:</b></p>
<p>For Wyldwood Radio, its bands and its listeners, the impact
is going to be huge. We will be able to cover the events in the UK and beyond
professionally with the correct equipment. We will then be able to edit the
interviews and write articles on-the-move and on-site at events and upload them
directly to the website and social media. Being able to get to these locations
will really boost what we can offer as a station, and allow us to be able to
bring many new things to you. Helping us reach our goal will mean you’re part
of something amazing and we thank you greatly for it.</p>
<p><b>Risks and Challenges:</b></p>
<p>As with anything there are always risks and challenges-
whatever we raise will be able to help the business with things we can’t
achieve now. Getting the image of the station to be much more professional with
Wyldwood Radio t-shirts and business cards will be a wonderful addition.</p>

</h3>
<div>Here is the link to this event on facebook: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/665566273548606/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/events/665566273548606/</a>

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">As you might already be aware of the recent catastrophic earthquake of 7.9 M that took place in Nepal causing a massive country-wide panic and leaving thousands of people helpless out on the streets.  The death poll has reached 7000 and is still climbing while thousands are left injured and homeless. In order to aid this calamity; We, Nepali Student Organization at the San Jose State University, have started this campaign. Please share the link with your friends and get this campaign going. A little effort on your part and make an enormous difference in someone's life. Let's do what we can to help Nepal bounce back from this Nightmare. Thank you so much for your time!</span><br/></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What you can do to help</h3> <p>We are hoping to raise close to $5000 in order to provide a decent support for the country that has been devastatingly hit by this disaster. This money will go towards rebuilding the country and helping the victims and their family reach comfort.</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>One of the easiest way to help Nepal at the moment is through donation because we are lacking financial support and proper medication. Through your donation, we plan to contribute to the organizations in Nepal and help better reach their goals in the lowest amount of time possible. </div>
<div>In the past, we have raised money for the landslide that took place in Sindhupalchok District of Nepal through our neighboring organization known as Nidan Foundation Nepal (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Nidan-Foundation-Nepal/512323185518616?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Nidan-Foundation...</a> ). We hope to do the same and make positive impact on the people who are in need of desperate help.</div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

</div></div>","WE ARE HOSTING A CANDLE LIGHT VIGIL AT SAN JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY ON WEDNESDAY 5/6/2015. PLEASE JOIN US TO SHOW SUPPORT!

Here is the link to this event on facebook: https://www.facebook.com/events/665566273548606/

Short Summary 
As you might already be aware of the recent catastrophic earthquake of 7.9 M that took place in Nepal causing a massive country-wide panic and leaving thousands of people helpless out on the streets.  The death poll has reached 7000 and is still climbing while thousands are left injured and homeless. In order to aid this calamity; We, Nepali Student Organization at the San Jose State University, have started this campaign. Please share the link with your friends and get this campaign going. A little effort on your part and make an enormous difference in someone's life. Let's do what we can to help Nepal bounce back from this Nightmare. Thank you so much for your time!
   What you can do to help We are hoping to raise close to $5000 in order to provide a decent support for the country that has been devastatingly hit by this disaster. This money will go towards rebuilding the country and helping the victims and their family reach comfort.   The Impact
One of the easiest way to help Nepal at the moment is through donation because we are lacking financial support and proper medication. Through your donation, we plan to contribute to the organizations in Nepal and help better reach their goals in the lowest amount of time possible. 
In the past, we have raised money for the landslide that took place in Sindhupalchok District of Nepal through our neighboring organization known as Nidan Foundation Nepal (https://www.facebook.com/pages/Nidan-Foundation... ). We hope to do the same and make positive impact on the people who are in need of desperate help.
    Risks & Challenges
During the last campaign, even though we did raise a decent amount of money, we were not able to reach our goal all the way. This time we have used two different organizations (Nidan Foundation Nepal and Nepali Student Organization) to further our campaign. Since these calamities have hit so close to home we have been more motivated to provide relief to our countrymen who are living this nightmare.    Other Ways You Can Help There is no such thing as a small help. Everything counts! You can also simply share the link of this campaign with your friends and everyone you know to help us promote it and reach our goal!

However, while these communities are ready to receive visitors, they still remain unnoticed even if they are located close to tourist attractions.

The website features a few communities in 8 countries.   Our web users can search and view these and then arrange for a booking via email.  We are in the process of enhancing this website. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that the functionality of this template is limited.  We anticipate the need to accommodate more listings that can be easily managed by the community leaders themselves.</p><p><b>Stage 2:</b> To address the gap in our current website, we aim to create a customised website.

<h1>Our Story</h1>
<p>We are a Melbourne-based group; each one of us has worked with organisations in different countries. Our visits to communities have created lasting relationships, as well as the desire to contribute to the locals’ social and economic development. In our travels, we reflected how, by focusing on the ""front region"", tourism development has displaced locals, often alienating them from their own territories. The other side of tourism however is the ""back region"", which often goes unnoticed. It is a region that provides small scale and low-impact homestay accommodation and tourist activities. Unfortunately, a number of potential community hosts we interacted with have expressed how they lack the capacity to promote their community as a tourist destination. What communities need is a promotional platform which will take community homestay accommodations into a higher level of tourism marketing.</p>
<p><a href=""http://communityhomestay.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CommunityHomestay.org</a> is founded by Rowee Delgado, who has recently finished a doctorate degree in community-based tourism development at the University of Melbourne.  In August 2014, Rowee brainstormed with Fiona McLauchlan and Janet Enriquez who have the technical and administrative skills needed to develop an online community venture. They sought guidance from Ms. Lindy Joubert, Director of the UNESCO Cultural Village Program and the Vice President of the World Craft Council in the Asia Pacific Region. In January 2015, they engaged Russel and Linda Drowley who have experience in community development work and pastoral care, to join the team. A few communities from Kenya, Bhutan, Cambodia, Thailand, Nepal, Malaysia, Vietnam, and the Philippines serve as pioneers of this global community-based tourism organisation, the Community Homestay Tourism Network. Shortly thereafter, they have obtained support from the Australia New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS Program) which guided them in the initial stages of business planning and development.</p>

<h1><b>Risks and Challenges</b></h1>

Travellers have valued their experiences staying with the locals. However, while these communities are ready to receive visitors, they still remain unnoticed even if they are located close to tourist attractions. In order to sustain their tourism initiatives, homestay hosts like Myra require a higher level of tourism marketing and promotions so more visitors can come and help them sustain tourism as a livelihood in their region.Online booking systems for tourist accommodations have been around for many years. But most of them focus on mainstream tourism, thus curtailing opportunities for locals to maximise the benefits of online promotional and bookings technology.It's time to innovate.Our VisionCommunity Homestay Tourism Network (CommunityHomestay.org) is a social enterprise that connects guests and hosts of tourist accommodations and cultural tours that are run by social groups and organisations in different countries.   This will be the first online tourism marketplace offering homestay packages that benefit thousands of communities around the world in just a single website.Our Goal Unlike mainstream tourist accommodations, there is currently no single centralised platform for promoting homestay packages.  A homestay package usually includes a minimum of 2 nights’ accommodation for a minimum of 2 guests, meals, and local tours that are initiated by the hosts. Our goal is to promote local lifestyle, cultural immersion and social interaction in a way that creates direct socio-economic benefits for the locals. We aim to attract students, young professionals, entrepreneurs and members of social groups as well as couples and families around the world who are interested in sustainable tourism development.The following images provide a few examples of such communities.

Our strategy: Why we need your helpThere are 2 stages involved in developing our website. Stage 1: With the help of friends, we have created a template-based website that enables hosts to list their community. The website features a few communities in 8 countries.   Our web users can search and view these and then arrange for a booking via email.  We are in the process of enhancing this website. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that the functionality of this template is limited.  We anticipate the need to accommodate more listings that can be easily managed by the community leaders themselves.Stage 2: To address the gap in our current website, we aim to create a customised website. Firstly, this website will allow unlimited listings and accommodate as many communities who are interested to participate. Secondly, the website shall allow guests to book through a system-generated communication that will lessen the time it takes to confirm availability, exchange information with hosts and finalise payments.The goal of raising funds through Indiegogo is to enable us to sustain Stage 1 and lead us into Stage 2.  There are 2 ways to support us: you can sign up either as a Member or as a Sponsor (see perk options on the upper right side of this page). Generally, CommunityHomestay.org will generate its revenue out of the administration and services fees. But with a combined sponsorships and booking fees, we will be able to afford the following: (1) a team of web developers who will create our customised  website, (2) administration costs, (3) tickets to travel and produce quality photos and videos of homestay communities, (4) Facebook and Google advertisements.Our initial goal is to raise $25,000 AUD gross funding from Indiegogo.  The net income (ranging from (20% to 50%) will be used to cover costs to upgrade the existing website (Stage 1), as well as to travel to 4 countries, i.e. Bhutan, Nepal, Cambodia and the Philippines.However, our ultimate goal is to raise $100,000 gross funding, the profit of which will cover running costs to create a new customised website (Stage 2), salaries and wages, and intensified online presence which will enable this online venture to becomes self-sustaining.Our ImpactYour support is the first step needed to achieve a professional and high quality promotion and online booking service that will raise the reputation of community tourism from the sideline to the forefront of online tourism products and services.We have identified over 5,000 community-based tourism providers in different countries which have the potential to list with us.  By efficiently promoting these communities in one website, CommunityHomestay.org will be able to generate up to 500K booking units which translates upto $5M annual revenue from booking fees. In time, proceeds will be invested back into communities to sustain and scale up their respective community development programs.  Check out our website (yet a work-in-progress) www.CommunityHomestay.org.

Our Story
We are a Melbourne-based group; each one of us has worked with organisations in different countries. Our visits to communities have created lasting relationships, as well as the desire to contribute to the locals’ social and economic development. In our travels, we reflected how, by focusing on the ""front region"", tourism development has displaced locals, often alienating them from their own territories. The other side of tourism however is the ""back region"", which often goes unnoticed. It is a region that provides small scale and low-impact homestay accommodation and tourist activities. Unfortunately, a number of potential community hosts we interacted with have expressed how they lack the capacity to promote their community as a tourist destination. What communities need is a promotional platform which will take community homestay accommodations into a higher level of tourism marketing.
CommunityHomestay.org is founded by Rowee Delgado, who has recently finished a doctorate degree in community-based tourism development at the University of Melbourne.  In August 2014, Rowee brainstormed with Fiona McLauchlan and Janet Enriquez who have the technical and administrative skills needed to develop an online community venture. They sought guidance from Ms. Lindy Joubert, Director of the UNESCO Cultural Village Program and the Vice President of the World Craft Council in the Asia Pacific Region. In January 2015, they engaged Russel and Linda Drowley who have experience in community development work and pastoral care, to join the team. A few communities from Kenya, Bhutan, Cambodia, Thailand, Nepal, Malaysia, Vietnam, and the Philippines serve as pioneers of this global community-based tourism organisation, the Community Homestay Tourism Network. Shortly thereafter, they have obtained support from the Australia New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS Program) which guided them in the initial stages of business planning and development.

Risks and Challenges
Aside from technical aspects of web development, the creation of an online marketplace considers several precautions in dealing with vulnerable cultural communities as well as in educating tourists.  In engaging communities, we ensure that we work closely with our local partners and NGO consultants in each country.  In Nepal for example, we are in constant communication with community officers who have redesigned homestay programs in regional communities to cater to the needs of communities after recent earthquakes in the central region.  For them, the devastation is not the end of tourism, rather the beginning of new tourism packages that incorporates volunteerism in communities. Our team's collective experiences in local tourism development and operations guarantees the overall success of addressing possible sustainability issues as well as safety concerns. The booking services will be supplemented with pre-trip and post-trip briefings, outlining expectations and levels of satisfaction of both hosts and guests.    Our Terms and Conditions are also available on our website so both hosts and guests are aware of the potentials and benefits of utilising our website services.",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Not just another Cat Café...</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>So by now,
just about everyone has heard of Cat Cafés!<span> 
Where there are cute cats to cuddle and relax with whilst enjoying a cup of
coffee or tea... you get the idea! You probably also have seen a crowdfunding
campaign like this one for a Cat Café as most have been set up through the
generous support of crowdfunders. So you are probably thinking what makes the
Capital Cat Café any different?</span></p>
<p>Well for
starters, the Capital Cat Café cats are not mere felines... They are all Prime
Ministers of Australia, Australian Governors General and ground-breaking
Australian Federal Parliamentarians!</p>
<p>At the
Capital Cat Café you will be able to meet Eddie aka Mr Edmund Barton,
Australia’s very first Prime Minister! You will also get to interact with
Australia’s first female Prime Minister, Ms Julia Gillard... ok, so not the
real Julia Gillard, but our Julia is also an intelligent, ginger-haired leader!
They
will be joined by many other Kitty-Parliamentarians who are putting litter-wars
aside and are forming their own government at the Capital Cat Café and want to take on Parliament House as
Canberra’s must-see tourist attraction!</p>
<p>The Capital
Cat Café will be completely unique to Canberra and like no other Cat Café in
the world! The cafe will be fitted out to reflect the Australian Nation’s Capital and
Canberra’s many tourist attractions. The Kitty-Parliamentarians will have their
own Prime Minister’s Office and Cabinet Room along with a mini Canberra decked
out with all the facilities and equipment a cat could ever want or need!</p>

</p>
<p>We are two sisters, animal lovers and now full time crazy

a Cat Café came from seeing the happiness that our own cat <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/Zanda.thecat"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Zanda</a> brought to people’s
lives via his social media. Our goal is to make the Capital Cat Café something
that Canberra and Australia are proud of. We have been working very hard all
year to make the Capital Cat Café a reality. It has not been an easy journey,
but we are finally getting there! </p>
<h3><br/></h3>

</h3>
<p>The welfare
of the café cats is of the upmost important to us. All the cats will be rescued
or rehomed cats that reside permanently in the Cat Café.  We are working hard to
find and personally choose cats with the right temperaments and personalities
to enjoy and actually thrive in a Cat Café environment. It is important to us
to know the cats individually, their needs and their quirks, prior to the Cat
Café opening and to do this we are currently building the team of Capital Cat
Café cats. Our commitment to our cats is for their life and to be responsible pet owners to each cat we will provide for them for the
duration of their lives, even after they may need to be retired from the Cat Café.</p>
<p>The cats
will live in kitty-wonderland created just for them.<span>  The Capital Cat Café will be their home. The
cats will not be available for adoption, however we will be supporting local
animal welfare and rescue groups and doing everything we can to promote animal

<p>We are
working with a local Vet who is advising us on how to provide the purr-fect
environment for the cats. The Vet will visit the cats at least monthly to check
on the health and wellbeing of the cats. We are also working with the local Pet
Ambulance Service, who be available to rush our cats to emergency treatment
should ever the need arise (Hopefully Never!)</p>
<p>We want to

<p>We all are forced from time to time to find excuses to cover or conceal some of our actions. Sometimes, though, problems come up.</p>
<p>We have to find a convincing excuse in a short period of time.</p>
<p>We have to remember what excuse we gave and to whom (if we engage in this “game” often is possible to be confused and expose ourselves irreversibly).</p>
<p>This application will have more than a <b>thousand excuses ready for you, divided in categories</b> and <b>you will be able to find quickly the right one</b>.</p>
<p>You can register in the application (though pc, tablet, smartphone) the person and the excuse you gave them and automatically date and time are added. You can also put in the reaction of this person to the excuse quickly though multiple choice option or by describing it yourself. This way in the future you will know which “excuse” you used, to whom and the reaction you received.</p>
<p><b>The application will also provide description of the scenario of the excuse...</b></p>
<p>e.g. You are out with friends (or anyone else...) but you have said to your partner that you are very busy at the office and stuck at exhausting meetings. A while before you return home this application will remind you to check everything that may give you away, as well as if you need to have something with you, what your appearance or your mood should be so to be more believable.</p>

<p><b>Innovative application of absolute data security<br/></b></p>
<p>The file to be saved “breaks down” in three different bit files and it is saved in three different servers located in three different continents with the exact location being kept a secret, since the existence of <b>these servers</b> is known to <b>only two people in the world</b> (<b>people that work with those servers do not know that they work for a data retention company</b>).</p>
<p>It is designed in a way that even if a file ends up in the wrong hands, the access to its content will be impossible.</p>
<p>This way even if the file is delivered after the order of the public prosecutor of a country, this file will not be readable because it will just be a 0-1 sequence with no meaning. </p>
<p><b>Even if a file is stolen from a server</b>, it would be totally useless because in order for the file to be readable the two other files are required and these files would be <b>saved in different servers in different unknown continents</b>.</p>
<p>Some features of the application:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recovery only via e-mail that you confirm.
</li>
<li>
Notification via e-mail of every activity of your files.
</li>
<li>
All-out destruction of the files on a specific date or via e-mail notification or in case you do not reply to an automatic e-mail which will be sent  as frequent as you determine.
</li>
<li>
When starting your subscription, you will receive a full contract which guarantees that these files will not be used for any other purpose but strictly for retention.

<b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">In some thematic sections there is no product order code, how can I order them?</b><br/>
</h3>
</div>
The thematic sections that have no product order code <b>are included
exclusively in the whole package ( ""All thematic sections (33)"" )</b>  and cannot be acquired otherwise. These
thematic sections are as <b>powerful as weapons</b> and cannot be distributed separately,
because only when combined with the other thematic sections, can they be used safely and
have the desired results.
<br/><br/><br/><h3><b>Is this method
suitable for everyone?</b></h3>
<p>NO, this method is not for everyone, it is given as <b>a
package deal here only for a few days</b>. </p>
<p><i>This is why there
will be a <b>questionnaire </b>in the official website  <b><a href=""http://thedevilsbible.com/Questionnaire.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">thedevilsbible.com</a> </b>though which the candidate
“clients” <b>will be assessed and they may not be admitted</b>. The ones that are
denied admission will not have the right to “purchase” this method or have
access to this “training”. </i> </p>
<p>Please refer to section “ And then, what?”</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>And then, what?</b></h3>
<p>The “training” is only the beginning. <b>The true goal is the
creation of a new innovative and original</b>, <b>universal network community</b> with
people that present the same characteristics (not racial), possibilities and
capacities (not physical) on a common, democratic base of values that all
members would share. This is why in the original website there is a
questionnaire that will help us assess the “clients”. The ones that will be
considered to be “inadmissible” do not have the right to “purchase” and have
access to the “training” of this method. </p>
<p>This method is basically a preparation in order to be able
to speak the same language, share knowledge and comprehend and understand
common concepts. </p>
<p>This community will not be governed by one leader, but it
will function democratically. </p>
<p>One of the goals of the community is to build not only
local but also internet businesses and companies. </p>
<p>The support of these companies will be shown through
advice and experience provided by the members of the community and the purchase
of products of these very members. </p>
<p>Another goal could be the <b>creation of an internet bank
like ""PayPal""</b> so that the companies owned by members of the community but also the
members themselves are not taxed for their transactions or are able to take out
interest-free loans. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Also we aim to the purchase of fields and agricultural real estate
and the production of agricultural eco-products (by members of the community), therefore
we will control what we consume. </p>
<p>We also have as target the purchase of areas rich in fresh water
so we would know what we drink. </p>
<p>The creation of data storage places that will belong to the community in order to know where our data is safely saved (the employees there will be members of the community) or even the development of our own web search engine is another important goal.<br/></p>
<p>All the great miracles were achieved by groups, come with us to
make our own group or community. This community will be the first in history
presenting these characteristics. Come with us, let’s all join our forces to
commence a revolution and build our own world.</p>
<p><b>All together we can achieve our purpose.</b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>In the last
offer you mentioned, the offer that includes all sections, you stated that I
can be founder member. Did you mean founder member of the website?</h3>
<p>NO, we mean founder member of the community that will be created
and will be named after voting with the participation of all members. We have
to remind you at this point that this is the first web community in the history
of the world that is created based on development and entrepreneurship. </p>
<p>We assume that the name will be related to a new universal web
community. </p>
<p>Our suggestions are “Global Web Society” (GWS) or “Wide Web World”
(WWW)  or something like that. </p>
<p>To conclude, your card will be uniquely and impressively designed
and only founder members will have it, with a unique authorization number. </p>

The result is very hard work for something that offers some or even
no pleasure in life.

influence.

We all are forced from time to time to find excuses to cover or conceal some of our actions. Sometimes, though, problems come up.
We have to find a convincing excuse in a short period of time.
We have to remember what excuse we gave and to whom (if we engage in this “game” often is possible to be confused and expose ourselves irreversibly).

Innovative application of absolute data security
The file to be saved “breaks down” in three different bit files and it is saved in three different servers located in three different continents with the exact location being kept a secret, since the existence of these servers is known to only two people in the world (people that work with those servers do not know that they work for a data retention company).
It is designed in a way that even if a file ends up in the wrong hands, the access to its content will be impossible.
This way even if the file is delivered after the order of the public prosecutor of a country, this file will not be readable because it will just be a 0-1 sequence with no meaning. 
Even if a file is stolen from a server, it would be totally useless because in order for the file to be readable the two other files are required and these files would be saved in different servers in different unknown continents.
Some features of the application:

Recovery only via e-mail that you confirm.


Notification via e-mail of every activity of your files.


All-out destruction of the files on a specific date or via e-mail notification or in case you do not reply to an automatic e-mail which will be sent  as frequent as you determine.


When starting your subscription, you will receive a full contract which guarantees that these files will not be used for any other purpose but strictly for retention.

* All applications run on pc, laptop, tablet and smartphones
** ATTENTION
In all aforementioned cases but especially as far as the website is concerned, subscribers will connect to servers using domain names irrelevant to the main websites.
E.g. let’s assume that the website thedevilsbible.com is the homepage of the website. Once you become subscribers you do not enter in this website but in a website where the domain name will be irrelevant, e.g. www.glm.com or www.123xyz.org or www.NewBiz.com  etc.
This way, no one will be able to relate the name of the website with its content.
Even for the same application for groups of users (e.g. groups of 100) the name will be different.
The user may also have the possibility to choose domain name.




In some thematic sections there is no product order code, how can I order them?


The thematic sections that have no product order code are included
exclusively in the whole package ( ""All thematic sections (33)"" )  and cannot be acquired otherwise. These
thematic sections are as powerful as weapons and cannot be distributed separately,
because only when combined with the other thematic sections, can they be used safely and
have the desired results.
Is this method
suitable for everyone?
NO, this method is not for everyone, it is given as a
package deal here only for a few days. 
This is why there
will be a questionnaire in the official website  thedevilsbible.com though which the candidate
“clients” will be assessed and they may not be admitted. The ones that are
denied admission will not have the right to “purchase” this method or have
access to this “training”.  
Please refer to section “ And then, what?”

And then, what?
The “training” is only the beginning. The true goal is the
creation of a new innovative and original, universal network community with
people that present the same characteristics (not racial), possibilities and
capacities (not physical) on a common, democratic base of values that all
members would share. This is why in the original website there is a
questionnaire that will help us assess the “clients”. The ones that will be
considered to be “inadmissible” do not have the right to “purchase” and have
access to the “training” of this method. 
This method is basically a preparation in order to be able
to speak the same language, share knowledge and comprehend and understand
common concepts. 
This community will not be governed by one leader, but it
will function democratically. 
One of the goals of the community is to build not only
local but also internet businesses and companies. 
The support of these companies will be shown through
advice and experience provided by the members of the community and the purchase
of products of these very members. 
Another goal could be the creation of an internet bank
like ""PayPal"" so that the companies owned by members of the community but also the
members themselves are not taxed for their transactions or are able to take out
interest-free loans. 

Also we aim to the purchase of fields and agricultural real estate
and the production of agricultural eco-products (by members of the community), therefore
we will control what we consume. 
We also have as target the purchase of areas rich in fresh water
so we would know what we drink. 
The creation of data storage places that will belong to the community in order to know where our data is safely saved (the employees there will be members of the community) or even the development of our own web search engine is another important goal.
All the great miracles were achieved by groups, come with us to
make our own group or community. This community will be the first in history
presenting these characteristics. Come with us, let’s all join our forces to
commence a revolution and build our own world.
All together we can achieve our purpose.

In the last
offer you mentioned, the offer that includes all sections, you stated that I
can be founder member. Did you mean founder member of the website?
NO, we mean founder member of the community that will be created
and will be named after voting with the participation of all members. We have
to remind you at this point that this is the first web community in the history
of the world that is created based on development and entrepreneurship. 
We assume that the name will be related to a new universal web
community. 
Our suggestions are “Global Web Society” (GWS) or “Wide Web World”
(WWW)  or something like that. 
To conclude, your card will be uniquely and impressively designed
and only founder members will have it, with a unique authorization number.",62.0,0,"1 Campaign

103.3AshevilleFM is a volunteer-based, grassroots community radio station created by Friends of Community Radio, a non-profit 501(c)entity. The idea for AshevilleFM was hatched in early 2009, when radio lovers from Western North Carolina came together to serve pipin’ hot sounds and have fun while doing it.
Our goal is to add to and reflect the rich stew of arts, culture and community involvement that is Asheville. We want to hear music, news, and the unusual all produced right here in our neck of the woods. We want to hear sounds from around the world, discerned and distilled just for us by our neighbors. We want to help make connections between diverse groups and support the local economy of ideas. We believe people from all parts of our community should have a chance to let their voice be heard. Sound Good? It’ll sound even better if you get involved and help us bring this vital local programming to our community!

Broadcasting online since 2009, our programming is truly free-form, including jazz and comedy, pop and poetry, rock ‘n’ roll and sports talk, world music and local news, hip-hop and health, old-school country and anarchist journalism, blues and kids’ shows, politics and dance music, live simulcasts and Spanish-language programming, and spotlights on local non-profits and community causes, with everything in between and more to come!

demands of our society puts great stress on the individual. Family and personal
lives, social interaction, education and career choices are challenges we all
face. Our veterans deal with these same challenges but with the added baggage
of physical and mental trauma. Service to our country comes with many costs.
When reentering the job market one penalty we face is “Lost Time”. Often
military occupations do not carry directly over to civilian equivalents. And
years of faithful service seem to have lost their value.</span></p>

</div></div>","Early October 24, 2013 I awoke to a phone call...the call that all parents of active duty service members dread. My son had become a casualty of war.But this did not happen on the battle field.My son suffered from the debilitating effects of PTSD.After surviving the battles fought by First Battalion Fifth Marines his injuries would linger for years.The physical and mental effects of this disorder are welldocumented. They effect all areas of the veterans’ life. Relationships, educationalgoals, social interactions, holding down a job, at times all seemingly impossible tasks.My name is Robert Slack. I am a Third Generation United States Marine Corps Veteran. Father of two Marine Corps Veterans and Director of Veterans Empowered through Technology VETT.



Vietnam‐era veterans comprised the largest group of veterans, making up
31.7 percent of California’s total population of veterans. More than three out of every
five (63.8 percent) Vietnam‐era veterans were between the ages of 55 and 64. Nearly 3 out of
every 10 (28.6 percent) Vietnam‐era veterans were age 65 or older.


Gulf War veterans from September 2001 forward, or recent
veterans, comprised 15.0 percent of California’s veteran population, followed
by veterans who served between the Vietnam era and the first Gulf War (12.6 of
all veterans), and Gulf War veterans who served between August 1990 and August
2001 (10.0 percent of all veterans). World War II veterans comprised less than
10 percent of California’s veteran population in 2009. 

EMPLOYMENT
 Nearly 80 percent of
all male veterans participate in the employment pool while only 73 percent of
civilian men do. However, our young male veterans, those 18-24, have a higher
unemployment rate than their civilian counterparts: 20.4 percent compared to
16.4 percent. Young women veterans (those aged 34 and under, have higher
unemployment rates than either male veterans or their female civilian
counterparts (civilian women aged 25-34 have 8.3 percent unemployment whereas
women veterans 25-34 have 11.6 percent unemployment and women from the most recent
conflict have 12.5 percent unemployment).
HOUSING
Male veterans living
in poverty are about 1.2 times more likely to progress to homelessness when
compared to civilians living in poverty. Women veterans, however, are twice as
likely as other adults to move into homelessness, and women veterans in poverty
are 2.7 times as likely to move into homelessness as other adults living in
poverty. For 18-30 year old veterans living in poverty, when compared to
non veteran adults living in poverty, veterans are 3.4 times as likely to become
homeless.


PHYSICAL HEALTH


Veterans face
different health problems than the civilian population. While heart disease,
high blood pressure, and musculoskeletal problems are common among veterans,
other physical issues not as common in the civilian population occur at high
rates for veterans. “Hearing impairment was the most common traumatic injury,
affecting some 63 percent of the veterans, followed by vision loss, orthopedic
injuries, traumatic brain injury (4.2 percent), burns, spinal cord injury, and
amputation (1.3 percent). Just over five percent of the veterans had polytrauma
wounds — multiple, complex injuries requiring intensive therapy.”


BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

Veterans face an array
of mental health problems. Depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD), and substance abuse all occur at higher rates for veterans than they do
for their civilian peers. Women veterans appear to be at greater risk for
developing behavioral health problems than their male counterparts.







Where do I start?What do I do?How do I succeed?


The
demands of our society puts great stress on the individual. Family and personal
lives, social interaction, education and career choices are challenges we all
face. Our veterans deal with these same challenges but with the added baggage
of physical and mental trauma. Service to our country comes with many costs.
When reentering the job market one penalty we face is “Lost Time”. Often
military occupations do not carry directly over to civilian equivalents. And
years of faithful service seem to have lost their value.
The VETT Program
supports the interests of the Veterans Administration, as well as the Education
Community and organizations like AARP, in finding new ways of providing
Veterans with resources that will help them improve their economic position, live
healthy fulfilling lives while continue to be productive contributors to their
communities. 


TECHNOLOGY BOOT CAMP


VETT BOOT CAMP. This ‘boot
camp’ challenges the individual to expand his or her talents and skills through
a 6 week, rigorous series of classes and hands on training focused on all
aspects of prototyping and design. Following the classroom instruction members apply the
training through participation in group prototyping sessions. These group
activities and workshops address the development of important collaborative
skills, required to maintain gainful employment and be comfortable in normal
social situations.


TECHSHOP AND VETT PARTNERSHIP



   

TechShop is a
membership-based do-it-yourself workshop and fabrication studio that supports a
growing community of makers and innovators. Along with classes and personal
instruction Veterans can use TechShop's cutting edge training and equipment to
become more competitive in the job market or pursue entrepreneurial goals while
interacting with other TechShop and community members, including fellow
Veterans.

What can $32,585 do?











IMMEDIATE IMPACT



 Upstream Suicide Intervention.


 Improving Veterans receptivity to Mental Health Care,


 Promote treatment,
Engagement, and Participation.


 Improve mental wellness by creating Innovative method of incentivizing        behavior.


  Provide an atmosphere that stimulates Veterans to achieve their Educational  and Career goals.


 Provide a usable skill set that can provide immediate job opportunities as  Private Contractors.


 Exposure to Entrepreneurial opportunities in a wide array of Emerging                 Technologies.



NATION WIDE
IMPACT



The explosion of Maker Spaces around the country is creating an innovation
revolution. Techshop is a leader with 8 facilities running and two in planning.
The Techshop Business model allows the VETT program to be ‘facility
independent’ and thus expansion and reach of services is unlimited.

NETWORKING
The final stage of the VETT program is to create a pool of skilled
veterans for the large quantity of California Tech Start-up businesses. Also many
established businesses need labor for overflow work. Contract labor fills this
need with lower costs to the employer and flexibility for the veteran
contractor. The contacts gained through networking can lead full time
employment or other business opportunities.

UAV remote sensing functions
include electromagnetic
spectrum sensors, gamma ray sensors, biological sensors, and
chemical sensors. A UAV's electromagnetic
sensors typically include visual spectrum, infrared,  or near-infrared cameras as well as radar systems. Biological sensors are sensors capable
of detecting the airborne presence of various microorganisms and other
biological factors.Chemical sensors use laser
spectroscopy to analyze the concentrations of each element in the air.Aerotestra, an innovator in the emerging field of Unmanned Arial Vehicle Systems, is

Project 2Cloud Based Telecommunications
Cloud communications providers
deliver voice & data communications applications and services, hosting them
on servers that the providers own and maintain, giving their customers access
to the “cloud.” Because they only pay for services or applications they use,
customers have a more cost-effective, reliable and secure communications
environment, without the headaches associated with more conventional PBX system
deployment.Semper Fi Telecommunications, a Veteran owned and operated tech company provides opportunities for
veterans choosing VETT Electronics Class track. Network equipment installation
and maintenance, troubleshooting, marketing and customer relations to support other
Non Profit and Veteran assistance organizations as well as the general public. 


Project 33d prototyping systems

Rapid prototyping is a group of techniques used to quickly fabricate a scale model of a
physical part or assembly using three-dimensional computer aided design(CAD) data.Construction of the part or assembly is usually done using 3D printing or ""additive layer manufacturing"" technology. As with CNC subtractive methods, the computer-aided-design -
computer-aided manufacturing CAD-CAM workflow in the traditional Rapid Prototyping process
starts with the creation of geometric data, either as a 3D solid using a CAD workstation, or 2D slices using a scanning device.GMax 3d printing system. The
gMax printer is ideal for printing large sized products that can be used in the
real world, high resolution models, as well as functional prototypes. All of
the printable component are available as downloads. Sources for all equipment
and materials are also available. The printers created in the program are
donated. VETT participants can then use Techshop to create their own 3D
printer.
