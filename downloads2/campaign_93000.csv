<h3>The Project<br/>
</h3> <p>On 11 March 2011, an earthquake with the magnitude of 9 struck the North-Eastern part of Japan. It was neither
  the first in recent years nor the strongest in history, yet the devastating consequences this time were beyond
  anyone’s imagination. Not only did a tsunami of unprecedented strength literally wash away many villages,
  defying all measures of protection that had been taken and robbing countless lifes, the collapse of nuclear
  reactors in the Fukushima power plant and the subsequent radiation left the nation aghast before an invisible and unscalable threat. <br/></p>
<p>When coming back to Japan after a hiatus of a year in 2012, I noticed a change in behaviour, in attitude that
  had taken place: Gone was the optimism that had always kept the country on course, even in the face of natural
  disasters that frequently strike the archipelago. Fear and uncertainty had spread, putting the nation in a sort
  of zombie mode where everyone kept on with his daily life without knowing what tomorrow would bring. Using a
  modified digital camera that captures infrared pictures, I sought to translate this particular mood into a
  photographic series, called “Tokyo Radiant”.

<h3>The Book and Your Contribution</h3>
<p>My plan is to publish a photo book of this series, with around 84 pages and 100 pictures, on 200g fine art paper and bound in hardcover. Layout for this book is almost finished, and completion and shipping is scheduled for early October 2016. <br/></p>
<p>The $ 4,000 USD I am asking for will cover production of the book, especially the printing part. In order to shoulder this, I am looking for your contribution.

<h3>
Why this Matters</h3>
<p>Let's be honest: As a piece of art, this project's whole justification lies in what it means to me, the photographer, and you, the audience. Despite its serious topic, it is no political piece and not meant to be accusatory in any way. Tokyo Radiant is an individual visualization of a world whose sense of security and certainty were shattered from one day to the other. If you like it, I am more than happy to receive your support! <br/></p>
<p>If you feel with the victims and want to do good, please have a look at the many NGOs that are specializing in this. I purposely do not wish to link this to the support of my book, because I feel it to be a bad compromise. Any help for the victims, many of whom still are living in temporary homes, probably matters much more than this book, but if you like the pictures and the idea behind it, you should support it, and exactly for this reason. By the way, you can find links to selected NGOs on my project website, <a href=""http://www.tokyo-radiant.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.tokyo-radiant.com</a><br/></p>
<p>If you like the project, but do choose not to support it financially, please consider spreading the word and sharing the information with people you know. Many thanks in advance!<br/></p>

<div>My name is Anna Shvab, I'm a biologist and underwater photographer. Since last year I have gone diving and photographed in the Red Sea in Israel and Jordan. In one year I have done more than one hundred photography dives. I have collected many interesting beautiful photos of incredible underwater creatures and shared it through the social media. People get inspired by my photos, they started asking questions, became interested in marine life, few of my friends even joined the open water dive courses. It helped me realize the meaning and the power of my photography - I can introduce this fascinating poorly explored world to the society. </div>

<h3>Why Pacific Ocean</h3>
<div>Pacific ocean is one of the most interesting areas of underwater world and it is also one of the most productive places for underwater photography. The diversity and amount of marine life in Pacific are incredible. In relatively short time I can explore there more species than in any other place. Also expenses of my journey will be significantly lower than elsewhere, and it will give me an opportunity to visit more dive spots and to accomplish more photography dives to improve and diversify my collection of underwater photographs for the book.  </div>

<div>To reach a diving destinations I will need a lot of transportation, I will try to visit as much different interesting dive spots as possible  to improve the diversity of my photos. <p></p>
<p>Diving is  not cheap, especially when you need to dive a lot... I have my own diving equipment and I don't need to rent, it will reduce the diving expenses. But underwater photography has its challenges - the sea is unpredictable and your time underwater is limited. You have only one hour or less to get the opportunity for a gear shot and try to get a photo that you want. You need to be lucky and patient. At some dive spots you can plan your dives with a specific animals, but sometimes you need more than one dive to the same place to get a good shot. To increase the chances I will need to dive a lot. </p>

</p><p>Usually, each photographer of our team gets a few emails/requests per
year from women of different occupations who’ve always dreamed of being a
fashion, lingerie or body art model but never tried. We decided to invite some
of the ladies for a photo-shoot session. And we got amazing results! Photos we
take are fantastic! Sometimes, non-professional models are so wild and
beautiful in front of a camera and it's really unexpected.</p>Based on this experience the idea of the “Cameleon” project was born. We want
to publish a photo book with photos of non-professional models who are in
different kinds of careers. We have already received over 50 requests from
ladies to be photographed who are in different occupations including:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>psychologist</li>
<li>lawyer</li>
<li>aircraft pilot</li>
<li>architect</li>
<li>yoga teacher</li>
<li>nurse</li>
<li>taxi driver etc.</li>

<p>Our goal is to show that people are beautiful regardless of occupation
or age, it is important when the beauty is authentic and natural.</p>

<h3>Thank you so much for your support!</h3></div>","What is the project ?
Usually, each photographer of our team gets a few emails/requests per
year from women of different occupations who’ve always dreamed of being a
fashion, lingerie or body art model but never tried. We decided to invite some
of the ladies for a photo-shoot session. And we got amazing results! Photos we
take are fantastic! Sometimes, non-professional models are so wild and
beautiful in front of a camera and it's really unexpected.Based on this experience the idea of the “Cameleon” project was born. We want
to publish a photo book with photos of non-professional models who are in
different kinds of careers. We have already received over 50 requests from
ladies to be photographed who are in different occupations including:
psychologist
lawyer
aircraft pilot
architect
yoga teacher
nurse
taxi driver etc.

Our goal is to show that people are beautiful regardless of occupation
or age, it is important when the beauty is authentic and natural.

And anyone could be a model for this project !
What do I receive ?
There are some great rewards to choose from including:

digital copy of the E-Book
original and signed limited edition Postcard
a signed copy of limited edition Photo book
participation in the project as a model
participation in the project as a photographer

<h2><strong>FRAME: How Asia Pacific feminist filmmakers + artists are confronting inequalities</strong></h2>
<p>FRAME is a photographic exhibition that focuses on the critical role feminist filmmakers play in addressing inequalities, starting in the Asia Pacific Region. This exhibition will be featured at the 12th Asia Pacific Screen Awards and the 9th Asia Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art (APT9) in Brisbane, Australia. Additionally, we plan to broaden the scope of this show to spotlight feminist filmmakers in other regions, and tour the exhibit at other key events and festivals, including the Tribeca Film Festival in NYC. This exhibit carries forward the momentum of the international movement ""50/50 by 2020"" to bring gender equality to film. Our bigger goal is to create a Feminist Film Academy, which aims to build a community of filmmakers and connect women to financial resources, to key policy forums, and to each other in order to raise diverse narratives and confront inequalities.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Help us get this show on the road!</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.arielandsam.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Photographers Ariel + Sam Soto-Suver</a> (based in California) have spent the year photographing women filmmakers of the Asia Pacific region, in order to mount this exhibition. These powerful images need to be printed, shipped and hung for the grand opening at the Asia Pacific Screen Awards (in Brisbane, Australia), where we will travel to in November. The cost of an international exhibit is high and the photographers need your help to make this show a reality. We will be reaching key influencers and advocating for the importance of gender equality through art, while featuring the work of incredible women filmmakers at this eminent event. The photographers will also use the funds for wrapping the show, and shipping it back to the US, where we plan to tour the exhibit, starting in NYC. We have already photographed women filmmakers in Taiwan, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, and Canada; and we plan to take more portraits in New York and when we travel to Australia as well. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Cinema is one of the most popular and powerful art forms of the modern world - it dismantles prejudices, inspires creative responses, and connects people across cultures. Yet, no formal community exists exclusively for feminist screen professionals in the Asia Pacific region and project funding remains limited. This is despite cinema playing a vital role in breaking down structural inequality and challenging social norms that perpetuate injustice. The photo exhibition plans to feature eight influential female filmmakers from Bangladesh, Australia, Cambodia, India, Laos, Vietnam, and Thailand—each given the platform to express the role they play as powerful catalysts for change in their own communities, and together, across the region. Some of the filmmakers we will feature have garnered international renown from the Oscars and at Cannes. Other brilliant filmmakers have the chance to expand their reach through the exhibition as well. An exhibition of these marginalized perspectives is critical. We will be signaling to the media, film audiences, and the industry itself, the importance of gender equality in film. The world needs films by women. Everyone benefits from exposure to the diversity of stories that women care about. </p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, greeting from Tokyo, Japan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Hiro Ugaya, a Tokyo-based male freelance journalist. I have been working as a full-time journalist ( writer / photographer ) since 1986 as a staff writer of Asahi Shimbun, one of Japanese national dailies, and weekly news magazine ""Aera"" as well as  freelancing since 2003.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Academically I have obtained a master degree of international affairs ( security policy ) from the School of International and Public Affairs of Columbia University in New York, USA,  as a recipient of Rotary International Foundation's scholarship, in the class of 1994. I also served as a foreign correspondent to New York from the Aera Magazine from 1998 to 1999.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>2. Why is this project  important to me?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have been covering the Fukushima's triple  meltdown accident since the Day One of March 11 2011 and traveled to the affected areas more than fifty times. I shot more than 250,000 photos in total  of the uninhabited communities and the evacuees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Professionally speaking, the Fukushima accident is  gigantic news in both scale of space and time.  230,000 were exposed to the radioactivity and 100,000 lost their homes.  Besides, the nuclear power plant accidents that exposed its neighbors to radioactive fall-put have taken place only three times in the human's history - Three Mile Island in 1979, Chernobyl in 1986 and then Fukushima. The aftermath of Fukushima accident is viewed to last for decades. For instance, decommission of the three melt-down reactors is believed to take at least thirty years.  I believe those facts on the accident's aftermath are worth being informed to the global public in order to consider our future energy and environmental policies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Outside my profession, I believe, as a human being,  the sufferings of the  affected people of Fukushima need more attention from the world. Professionally I am neither pro nor con for nuclear power. Simply I can not turn my eyes away from  the people in need. Some have lost their homes. Some got lethal illness. The reality is too harsh for them. This is a matter of human conscience.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>3. Why do I need financial support?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, the news of Fukushima is decreasing as time goes by. Newspapers, TV and magazines, the major news  media of Japan, are withdrawing from reporting Fukushima- some for financial and business reason and  some for its  political position of pro-nuclear energy. Anyway news of Fukushima is quickly disappearing from major mass media in Japan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is causing me  two problems. First, now they hardly publish  reports of Fukushima. Editors and producers are increasingly reluctant to run news story on Fukushima’s aftermath by mentioning  similar excuses such as “the news of Fukushima accident does not sell” or “the disaster stories are too dark and negative” or “our readers want to read ‘Japan is doing OK stories’”. Anyway I am losing traditional media outlet. So I have decided to publish photo report book on internet  by myself to reach the global audience.  Secondly, they do not pay for the reporters' fees and expenses. So I had to decide to report the news by using my own dime and selling them on a pay-per-view blog. In the year of 2016, I managed to publish the first digital photo report titled <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UPC2E20/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_x_rY1gzbN97D1TF"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">“Portrait of Fukushima: Life After Meltdowns 2011-2015.”  </a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, after having worked hard in this way for six years,  the financing model is reaching the limit. In short,  I am running out of money. But I do not want to give up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>4. How much do I need to cover Fukushima and to publish a digital book?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Seven day travel from Tokyo to Fukushima cost approximately 1,000 US dollars in minimum.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>*Accomodation: $400</p>
<p>*Transportation ( round-trip train ticket from Tokyo to Fukushima, rent-a-car, gasoline ) : $600  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ideally, I should visit Fukushima once in every season - four times in a year. Thus the annual expenses excluding my own payment cost $4,000.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the  process of editing a digital photo report book costs;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>*Hiring an editor : $500</p>
<p>*Hiring a editorial designer: $500 </p>
<p>*Hiring a translator $ 500</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In total, $1,500 in minimum.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please note those prices do NOT include fee for myself - financial source to make my own living.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Therefore, if I wish to publish the report every year, I need $5,500 in total. I set the goal of total donation of $ 15,000 for publication of two years tentatively- expecting some unpredictable  expenses such as more frequent travel to Fukushima in case of emergency.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>5. How am I going to spend the donated money?</strong></p>
<p> </p>

<p>May 17, 2017.</p>
<p>Tokyo, Japan.</p>
<p> </p>
</div></div>","1. Introduction
 
Ladies and gentlemen, greeting from Tokyo, Japan.
 
My name is Hiro Ugaya, a Tokyo-based male freelance journalist. I have been working as a full-time journalist ( writer / photographer ) since 1986 as a staff writer of Asahi Shimbun, one of Japanese national dailies, and weekly news magazine ""Aera"" as well as  freelancing since 2003.
 
Academically I have obtained a master degree of international affairs ( security policy ) from the School of International and Public Affairs of Columbia University in New York, USA,  as a recipient of Rotary International Foundation's scholarship, in the class of 1994. I also served as a foreign correspondent to New York from the Aera Magazine from 1998 to 1999.
 
2. Why is this project  important to me?
 
I have been covering the Fukushima's triple  meltdown accident since the Day One of March 11 2011 and traveled to the affected areas more than fifty times. I shot more than 250,000 photos in total  of the uninhabited communities and the evacuees.
 
Professionally speaking, the Fukushima accident is  gigantic news in both scale of space and time.  230,000 were exposed to the radioactivity and 100,000 lost their homes.  Besides, the nuclear power plant accidents that exposed its neighbors to radioactive fall-put have taken place only three times in the human's history - Three Mile Island in 1979, Chernobyl in 1986 and then Fukushima. The aftermath of Fukushima accident is viewed to last for decades. For instance, decommission of the three melt-down reactors is believed to take at least thirty years.  I believe those facts on the accident's aftermath are worth being informed to the global public in order to consider our future energy and environmental policies.
 
Outside my profession, I believe, as a human being,  the sufferings of the  affected people of Fukushima need more attention from the world. Professionally I am neither pro nor con for nuclear power. Simply I can not turn my eyes away from  the people in need. Some have lost their homes. Some got lethal illness. The reality is too harsh for them. This is a matter of human conscience.
 
3. Why do I need financial support?
 
However, the news of Fukushima is decreasing as time goes by. Newspapers, TV and magazines, the major news  media of Japan, are withdrawing from reporting Fukushima- some for financial and business reason and  some for its  political position of pro-nuclear energy. Anyway news of Fukushima is quickly disappearing from major mass media in Japan.
 
This is causing me  two problems. First, now they hardly publish  reports of Fukushima. Editors and producers are increasingly reluctant to run news story on Fukushima’s aftermath by mentioning  similar excuses such as “the news of Fukushima accident does not sell” or “the disaster stories are too dark and negative” or “our readers want to read ‘Japan is doing OK stories’”. Anyway I am losing traditional media outlet. So I have decided to publish photo report book on internet  by myself to reach the global audience.  Secondly, they do not pay for the reporters' fees and expenses. So I had to decide to report the news by using my own dime and selling them on a pay-per-view blog. In the year of 2016, I managed to publish the first digital photo report titled “Portrait of Fukushima: Life After Meltdowns 2011-2015.”  
 
However, after having worked hard in this way for six years,  the financing model is reaching the limit. In short,  I am running out of money. But I do not want to give up.
 
4. How much do I need to cover Fukushima and to publish a digital book?
 
Seven day travel from Tokyo to Fukushima cost approximately 1,000 US dollars in minimum.
 
*Accomodation: $400
*Transportation ( round-trip train ticket from Tokyo to Fukushima, rent-a-car, gasoline ) : $600  
 
Ideally, I should visit Fukushima once in every season - four times in a year. Thus the annual expenses excluding my own payment cost $4,000.
Meanwhile, the  process of editing a digital photo report book costs;
 
*Hiring an editor : $500
*Hiring a editorial designer: $500 
*Hiring a translator $ 500
 
In total, $1,500 in minimum.
 
Please note those prices do NOT include fee for myself - financial source to make my own living.
 
Therefore, if I wish to publish the report every year, I need $5,500 in total. I set the goal of total donation of $ 15,000 for publication of two years tentatively- expecting some unpredictable  expenses such as more frequent travel to Fukushima in case of emergency.
 
5. How am I going to spend the donated money?
 
Basically, I will spend the money as described in the paragraph 4. In addition,  maintenance of camera equipment may require some additional expense. 
 
6.What kind of perks would donator get?
 
*""Thank you very much note"" on e-mail or Indiegogo messages from myself.
*Project up-date news letter.
*Print your names as “supporters”or ”donators” or “producers” on photo report book.
*For large  amount donators, free copy of the book.
*For larger amount donators, autographed physical photo copy from the book.
 
7.Why is this project valuable?
 
There are too many important news from Fukushima that has not obtained good global attention yet. At present of may 2017, 100,000 neighbors are still displaced on evacuation. Two leukemias and thyroid cancers have been officially confirmed among the clean-up workers of the power plant. I firmly believe those facts are worth being informed to the global public in order to shape our future energy and environmental policies.  Once again, professionally I am nor pro nor con of the nuclear energy. My job is not to judge but to inform the public facts so that they can make decision.
 
I am professionally highly motivated and qualified to pursue this project. I have been continuing traveling to Fukushima more than fifty times and published one digital book in English. My thirty-one  year journalist carrier is sure to help me in continuing the report activities ( travels  to the field, shooting photos, writing and editing reports, etc. ) in the future - as my life work. 
 
8.Is there a risk or challenge?
 
Yes. 
*I am 54 years old. The nuclear aftermath will continue for decades. I am going to be an old man. Someday it might get physically challenging  to travel back and forth.
*I might get health problem by being exposed to radioactive dose. In order to avoid that rick, I always manage my own dose by carrying dose meter with me with its alarm sound on. I avoid the risky hot spots. When I return from the contaminated areas, I make it rule to receive public screening.
*Government and TEPCO, the electric company, are least supportive for journalists. Especially entry to the troubled nuclear power plant itself is strictly controlled. They hardly permit journalists to approach the problem zones they are reluctant to show.
 
9. Is there a way to help me other than donating money?
 
Yes. Please spread the words of mouth  to your friends and family members through internet - on Indiegogo, Facebook, Tiwtter, e-mails or whatever. If you would like to see me on internet,  please check the links listed below.

<p>Hey, my name is Byran and I am a photographer, videographer and all-round creative based in the picturesque kingdom of East London. My background is in TV and Film production, I hold a BA in Scriptwriting for Film and TV and an MA in Producing Film and TV.</p>
<p>More recently I have taken up the art of photography. Any photographer out there will tell you that it can quickly become an expensive hobby and one of the biggest expenses is studio hire. To gain access to a studio you are often look at upwards of £200 a day which most novices and beginners can't afford. I don't think access to a studio should only be viable for full-time photographers.</p>
<p>A lot of people these days just want to create content for their own social media channels or simply for recreational purposes. And to do this, you don't need the latest and greatest equipment. Some times a backdrop, some decent strobes and a camera is all you need.</p>
<p>Even though the primary use will be photo and video centric, we also want it to be a flexible space. Whether you need rehearsal space, recording a podcast or just need a room to yourself then we will do our best to cater to your needs.</p>
<p>ByranCito Space aims to keep studio hire simple, easy and affordable for up and coming creatives.</p>
<h3>The Space</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1604416424/lflgryrectdex4hjrmzr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The space itself is an 11ftx13ft sized back office in Hornchurch, East London. It is located right next to Hornchurch Underground Station and is very close to local amenities. Access to the space is through a gate and secure door and is one of a handful of office spaces in the property. It has a kitchenette, toilet and is cleaned weekly. There is 24/7 access to the space.</p>
<p>It's a cosy studio that will have a make-up area, seating and backdrop support, perfect for small scale shoots such as:<br/><strong>- Corporate Headshots<br/>- Newborn Baby<br/>- Cake Smash<br/>- Portraits<br/>- Talking Head Videos<br/>- Fashion<br/>- Product</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What's in it For You<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603813971/sb3bxgxapdosaitybbev.png"" src=""""/>
</h3>
<p>To get the project up and off the ground I am already investing a lot of my own money. Mainly on rent for the space itself. Your donations will go towards kitting out the space with equipment.</p>
<p>This is a scalable project, and to start with, it is only necessary to obtain the essential equipment to get the space up and running. We are looking to raise £2000. (See what I mean about photography being expensive)</p>
<p>This is how your generous donations will be spent.</p>
<p><strong>- Used Canon DSLR (Most Likely a Canon 6D or 5D Mark III)<br/>- 2 x Godox SK400II Strobe with wireless trigger<br/>- 2x Light Stands<br/>- Backdrop Support (autopoles, rollers and clamps)<br/>- Paper roll backdrops of different colours<br/>- Tripod<br/>- Reflectors<br/>- Sound Blankets<br/>- Furniture (Mirror, Tables, Desks, Plants, Decor)<br/>- Advertising</strong></p>
<p>We will be offering a range of perks that include use of the studio once it is up and running and you can hire me for your own personal photoshoot for your portfolio or social media.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our target we will simply use what funds we have and prioritise which equipment to get.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603814210/k7nvvm7vswnxzegchfew.png"" src=""""/>
</h3>
<p>Your generosity to the cause will have a profound impact on me and my own creative endeavours. It has always been a dream of mine to have my own creative space but I feel that it is also my duty to share it with others.</p>
<p>Our creativity shouldn't have any bounds and we should be able to express it without having to worry about the financial risk. There are a high concentration of studios in the inner east of London but this is an opportunity to make it more accessible for people who live further out or in the Essex area.</p>
<p>I have experience turning an idea into reality from my film background and when I have something I truly believe in, I will do my best to make it a success. And with most creative projects, I can't do this alone.</p>
<h3>Proposed Pricing<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603814030/iznrc0h3schbcecqydz5.png"" src=""""/>
</h3>
<p>We want to keep it affordable. The space isn't out to make huge profits. The main aim is to make it a place where people want to come and be creative.</p>
<p><strong>£50 - Half day booking of 4 hours<br/>£100 - Full day Booking of 8 hours<br/>£15 - For additional hours</strong></p>
<p>These prices are all in. For use of all equipment in the studio. There's no extra charges or hidden costs. Theoretically you can start being creative with no equipment of your own, the space will have everything you need.</p>
<p>We also want to be attentive to people's needs. We will not simply turn someone away who isn't able to afford it, instead we will work with them to see what packages or discounts we can offer.</p>
<p>But with what's on the market today this pricing is very affordable. As we begin to scale up in the future and buy more and better equipment I believe there is room to reasonably increase this price.</p>
<h3>More than just a space</h3>
<p>The space will be our main focus but in order to maximise our outreach and appeal we will be offering our equipment for hire even if people do not want to use it in the space itself. This will mainly be managed through Fat Llama where creatives are able to book kit in advance and use it for a period of time.</p>
<p>This will be another stream of income and will allow our service to be a little more flexible. Equipment that will be available to hire out will include:<br/><strong>- Cameras<br/>- Lenses<br/>- Microphones<br/>- Tripods</strong></p>
<p>And any other equipment we may acquire in the future that we feel creatives may find a use for.</p>
<p>Seeing as we are aiming this predominantly at beginners, amateurs and novices there is also the opportunity to learn basic camera and video skills from yours truly. I feel as though I have enough knowledge in photography and video production that it may be of use to whoever needs it. It doesn't just have to be a case of giving someone access to the space and leaving them to their own devices.</p>
<p>We want to build a community, a creative hub that can cater to a wide variety of creative needs for the individual. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risky Business?<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603814134/dfhbanmwojobjs23nhsb.png"" src=""""/>
</h3>
<p>The business ultimately has low risk. The cost of rent for the space is manageable and includes electricity so there will never be any unexpected bills.</p>
<p>My only concern is striking a balance between keeping it simple but still making it a space that is useful to people. We want the equipment and space to be adequate for people's needs but we also do not want it to be overkill.</p>
<p>There is definitely a market for people wanting cheap creative space, the challenge will just be getting the word out and making sure people know about us.</p>
<p>In order for the space to pay for itself it will need at least 4 full day bookings a month.</p>
<h3>What About Covid?</h3>
<p>The aim is to kit out the studio during the current lockdown restrictions so it is up and running when the guidelines are eased. However we will still aim to make sure the space is as safe as possible. For this we will limit the amount of people in the studio. ensure face masks are worn where appropriate and adequately clean equipment after every use.</p>
<p>The arts will survive this and ByranCito space will be there waiting for people who are eager to get out and start creating again.</p>

<p>This idea was born from attempting to find an affordable space to record my new podcast. A lot of spaces were frankly offering too much for what I needed when in reality all I wanted was a room.</p>
<p>This space will act as our dedicated studio to film and record all future episodes of the podcast.</p>
<h3>Long Term Plans</h3>
<p>The idea is to start off small and test the waters. With good interest and the emergence of a growing creative community we hope to be able to expand and improve the space in any way we can. This may include upgrading equipment, obtaining more equipment or renting out other spaces. We hope to eventually be able to have a space with natural light, plenty of space and the latest equipment that is accessible to your average aspiring content creator.</p>
<p>We also want to eventually be in a position where we can create our own original content using upcoming creatives that have become part of the community. These can be short films, YouTube web series, podcasts, photography projects and much more!</p>

This idea was born from attempting to find an affordable space to record my new podcast. A lot of spaces were frankly offering too much for what I needed when in reality all I wanted was a room.
This space will act as our dedicated studio to film and record all future episodes of the podcast.

This may include upgrading equipment, obtaining more equipment or renting out other spaces.

<br/><br/>What is Stripway?</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">     Stripway is a Social Media Platform that allows you to share photos into personalized Strips. These Strips will enable you to categorize different events, hobbies, sports and life experiences. Your profile will no longer be a cluttered mess. Not only do you benefit from having an organized profile but you will also have the freedom to post as many photos as you'd like since there is no limit to the number of Strips you can create. <br/><br/>     Oh, yeah? Did we forget to mention you can SWITCH these strips around?  That's right, Stripway allows you to feature any Strip you want in any order you wish. Are you currently on vacation and want to show all the fantastic photos you have taken? You can go ahead and place that strip at the top of your profile for everyone to see. Have you changed your mind? No problem, you can re-arrange your profile to have a fresh new look. <br/><br/>   </p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/dFd4RZmo8W8"" width=""560""></iframe></div><br/> <p></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">How is Stripway different?</h3>
<p>     What if you want to share photos of you with friends, family or pets. How about your hobbies or travels? Instead of mixing them all, you can place them in their corresponding Strip. Now when your friends or followers come to view your profile. They can choose which Strip they'd like to explore that interests them. <br/><br/>     Stripway has an unlimited amount of ways to customize and arrange your profile. Let's say for example you are big into fitness and love to share pictures of your daily routine and workouts. You can have a Strip called ""Fitness"" and share all your workouts there. That's great; however, there is more to your fitness lifestyle. What about all the food, supplements, or outfits you use that part take in it. You can create a Strip for each of these categories and share more of what you do. Now all your friends and followers who have a similar interest will be able to look into these strips and get a better description of your daily workout or routine. </p>

<p>For those who want an exclusive keepsake, we have 10 Polaroid images that are one-of-a-kind that no one else in the world will be awarded.</p>
<h3>The Model</h3>
<p>Born in New England, Shawna is 5'5"" and has modeled at locations across America.  Built for art modeling, her stats are a 32D-24-33, dress size 2. Her olive skin and flowing brown hair are a perfect complement to the blue of the sky, green fields, and sandy shore of Rooster Rock.</p>
<p>We have completed our early morning shoot where we hiked around Rooster Rock Park near Portland, Oregon.  Shawna posed nude in multiple locations throughout the park including:</p>
<ul>

<p>I have documented the beginnings and the endings of my relationships, captured in bursts of 1/125th of a second. DEAR SHIRLEY is filled with humor, anger, missed cues and discouragement. It is also about falling in love and the promise and excitement of finding someone to spend my life with. I see 2018 as the right time for a conversation about the hopes for queer marriages and the risks entailed. Like others in the 1970’s and 80’s, I was seeking a new path for myself. Ever been in love? Ever seen it all called into question? By the mid 2000's, the joy was being replaced with frustration, misunderstanding and an inability to crawl out of deep ruts. All the ingredients for a perfect afternoon read. And who doesn’t like to read other people’s mail?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Daylight Books is designing, printing, and marketing the book.  However, I must make a substantial contribution to this process. I want to make that contribution with help from friends, old and new. I am asking you to make a contribution either as a cash donation (which includes a perk) or passing along the link to the campaign via email and social media. Your support is crucial to bringing DEAR SHIRLEY to a wide community.    </p>
<p>My personal work has been exhibited locally and internationally. Images from the second chapter of DEAR SHIRLEY, entitled A True Story, were awarded first prize in the open category of the International Pride Photo Awards 2011. </p>
<p>For twenty years I was a full-time photojournalist at <i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i>. Currently I teach photography of many genres. You can read student comments on my website. (<a href=""http://hindaschuman.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://hindaschuman.net</a>).  </p>
<p>Because this book is both so personal and public, I see DEAR SHIRLEY as an opportunity to speak to people who find their way to this story.  It is both a portrait and a visual memoir. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
<p>My share of the publication costs is $32,500. That is an annual salary for many families.  Knowing that, it makes it all the more difficult for me to ask for help for a personal project. But I  have seen that DEAR SHIRLEY  can touch many people. I hope to make people laugh and speak out loud of thoughts kept bottled up inside. I hope it is a catalyst for many discussions.</p>
<p>Perks are a small way for me to thank you for your support. Advanced, signed copies of the book are the top offer. There are also options to own a signed print from the first edition. The sizes are from 8 ½” X 11” to 17”X 22”.  A terrific tote bag with an imprint from the book; an opportunity for an individual 1-hour critique of your photographs via Skype are among the other perks offered. There will also be Secret Perks so stay updated to find out about what I have yet to reveal. I have chosen a flexible goal for my campaign because the thought of not quite reaching my goal and having the momentum slip, and the book not reaching a broad audience seems too much to lose. With your help DEAR SHIRLEY will be in print and available for sale. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Risks &amp; Challenges</p>
<p>I have many friends supporting my Indiegogo campaign. They are truly the spine and spirit of this goal. They advised me about long walks off short piers. They offered marketing tips and created spreadsheets for me to keep track of the financial end of the crowd sourcing campaign. Special thanks and gratitude to the team at 6 Eighteen Studios, Shelagh Byrne and Linda Johnson, who created the video of my Indiegogo campaign.  (<a href=""http://6eighteenstudios.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://6eighteenstudios.com</a>). My dear friend Eve has provided invaluable help with the financial calculations and editorial nuts and bolts of this campaign. I have received so much encouragement that I find it fills me with emotion.  With their help and with yours we will reach this goal. </p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<p>I so value your acknowledgement that what I am creating is worth the effort – some of that will be via your support with financial contributions. There are many who would like to offer support but can’t do a cash donation. I value cheers and loud proclamations of “yea!” Sending links to social media or letting friends know via email or word of mouth is a most welcome gift. My email address is dear1shirley@gmail.com, for those who want to communicate directly with me. Any funds raised above the $32,500 I will contribute to public libraries and LGBTQ organizations.</p>

<h3><strong>Book &amp; Project Description:</strong></h3>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p>In every era, architects have dazzled with their ability to transcend the status quo to achieve timeless beauty coupled with efficient design, it is in the building’s windows that it comes to life. Because they serve as a bridge between nature and the building’s interior, they bring nature’s vitality inside the building. How they create that bridge defines the personality of its builder—and those who commissioned him.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508006359/d78z0aw0sitqlhjp5sni.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Humility—or a lack thereof—in a building’s original owner often reflects in the building’s windows. The plain, rustic windows of a peasant dwelling contrast with those of a palace, whose royal owners demonstrate their power and wealth with flashy, opulent windows with intricate design and gilt trim. Others, following Frank Lloyd Wright’s lead, create buildings whose windows extend the occupants’ line of sight way beyond the physical boundaries of the home to encompass nature itself.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508263567/ldsrzpdsvyndc39g40yg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>One small glass pane that separates the exterior from the civilisation inside. Security. A safe place from which one can view the world beyond. The way in which every architect, every owner has visualised that barrier inspired me to showcase the sheer variety of that vision. Across cultures, across time, window designs have evolved and adapted, much as humankind itself. That evolution formed the basis of this work.</p>
<p>Not only do buildings themselves have a distinctive identity, but cities, too, have their own design aesthetic. As in individual buildings, that distinction shows its face best through the city’s various windows. As a result, I chose to showcase the collections city by city, highlighting the subtle differences that separate one city’s windows from another’s.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508006489/r0mgeyvkp5axankaxc2b.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Gaze into the tiled windows of Lisbon and see the white facades of Alentejo. In the Azores, Sao Miguel’s windows incorporate local volcanic rock into their design—closing the gap between nature and civilisation even more.</p>
<p>It’s not always the most famous windows, nor the most lovely, who tell the best stories. Often, it is the well-worn windows that best reveal a building’s story. The laughs, the loves—the ravages of war—all add to that building’s intrigue.</p>

<p>A far cry from humankind’s earliest windows—simple holes in a shelter’s walls—city windows show the sheer variety into which this design element has evolved. This collection of photographs showcases that variety with its careful study of urban architecture throughout the world. City by city, readers can see the subtle differences in each city’s cultural aesthetic as displayed by windows of the world.</p>

Because they serve as a bridge between nature and the building’s interior, they bring nature’s vitality inside the building.

<p>Ciklus radova Flash For Fantasy sam počeo 1998 godine. 2002. i 2007. su se dogodile prve dve izložbe iz tog ciklusa.</p>
<p>Izložba Flesh for Fantasy 3 je projekat na kome sam radio skoro sedam godina, od 2011-2017. Snimano je u nekoliko zemalja i preko deset lokacija.  Ovom izložbom želim da prkažem ženski akt kao umetničku temu, kontrast lepote i različitosti oblika ženskog tela i devastiranih ambijenata.Da bi se video kvalitet, neophodno je da izložba bude isproducirana na pravi način. To podrazumeva izradu i opremanje 50 fotografija velikih formata ,štampanje kataloga i knjige. Izložba je planirana za Mart 2018. u galeriji Progres u Beogradu i galerije Art for All u Kralja Petra u Beogradu takođe. Planirano je da isto veče budu dva otvaranja izložba a promociju monografije bi ostavili za neki drugi dan tokom izložbe. Fotografije će biti štampane na satenu i ekskluzivno opremljene. Izložbu će pratiti i video rad.</p>
<p>Zato sam se odlučio da zatražim od vas da budete deo mog projekta i vim putem želim da mi pomognete oko produkcije, tako što ćete donacijom dobiti moje umetničke fotografije po promo cenama . Ceo ciklus sadrži 50 fotografija potpisanih serigrafija 1-10,  ( veličine 50x75cm, 140x95cm na satenu, zategnute na blind ramove) </p>
<p>Sredstva su potrebna za štampu fotografija na satenu oko 1400$, za uramljivanje oko 800$ i za katalog 600$ i za štampu pratećeg materijala 200 $, 300$ renta video opreme i ekrana</p>
<p>sve radove možete videti na mom sajtu <a href=""http://www.ivangrlic.com/flesh-for-fantasy.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.ivangrlic.com/flesh-for-fantasy.html</a></p>
<p><br/>The exhibition Flesh for Fantasy 3 is a project I have been working on for almost seven years, from 2011-2017. It has been recorded in several countries and over ten locations. With this exhibition I want to show women's nudity as an artistic theme, the contrast of beauty and the differences in the shape of a woman's body and devastated ambient. It is necessary that the exhibition be reproduced in the right way. This involves the creation and framing of 50 large format photos, printing of catalogue and book. The exhibition is planned for March 2018 at the Progres Gallery in downtown of Belgrade and the Art for All Gallery in downtown of Belgrade too.<br/>That's why I decided to ask you to be part of my project and I want you to help me with the production, by giving me my artistic promotions at promo prices. The whole cycle contains 50 photographs of the signed seriography 1-10, (size 50x75cm, 140x95cm per satin, tightened on blind frames)<br/><br/>Funds are needed to print photos about $ 1400, for framing around $ 800 and for a $ 600 catalogue and  $ 500 for rent video equipment and screens.</p>

</div></div>","Ciklus radova Flash For Fantasy sam počeo 1998 godine. 2002. i 2007. su se dogodile prve dve izložbe iz tog ciklusa.
Izložba Flesh for Fantasy 3 je projekat na kome sam radio skoro sedam godina, od 2011-2017. Snimano je u nekoliko zemalja i preko deset lokacija.  Ovom izložbom želim da prkažem ženski akt kao umetničku temu, kontrast lepote i različitosti oblika ženskog tela i devastiranih ambijenata.Da bi se video kvalitet, neophodno je da izložba bude isproducirana na pravi način. To podrazumeva izradu i opremanje 50 fotografija velikih formata ,štampanje kataloga i knjige. Izložba je planirana za Mart 2018. u galeriji Progres u Beogradu i galerije Art for All u Kralja Petra u Beogradu takođe. Planirano je da isto veče budu dva otvaranja izložba a promociju monografije bi ostavili za neki drugi dan tokom izložbe. Fotografije će biti štampane na satenu i ekskluzivno opremljene. Izložbu će pratiti i video rad.
Zato sam se odlučio da zatražim od vas da budete deo mog projekta i vim putem želim da mi pomognete oko produkcije, tako što ćete donacijom dobiti moje umetničke fotografije po promo cenama . Ceo ciklus sadrži 50 fotografija potpisanih serigrafija 1-10,  ( veličine 50x75cm, 140x95cm na satenu, zategnute na blind ramove) 
Sredstva su potrebna za štampu fotografija na satenu oko 1400$, za uramljivanje oko 800$ i za katalog 600$ i za štampu pratećeg materijala 200 $, 300$ renta video opreme i ekrana
sve radove možete videti na mom sajtu http://www.ivangrlic.com/flesh-for-fantasy.html
The exhibition Flesh for Fantasy 3 is a project I have been working on for almost seven years, from 2011-2017. It has been recorded in several countries and over ten locations. With this exhibition I want to show women's nudity as an artistic theme, the contrast of beauty and the differences in the shape of a woman's body and devastated ambient. It is necessary that the exhibition be reproduced in the right way. This involves the creation and framing of 50 large format photos, printing of catalogue and book. The exhibition is planned for March 2018 at the Progres Gallery in downtown of Belgrade and the Art for All Gallery in downtown of Belgrade too.That's why I decided to ask you to be part of my project and I want you to help me with the production, by giving me my artistic promotions at promo prices. The whole cycle contains 50 photographs of the signed seriography 1-10, (size 50x75cm, 140x95cm per satin, tightened on blind frames)Funds are needed to print photos about $ 1400, for framing around $ 800 and for a $ 600 catalogue and  $ 500 for rent video equipment and screens.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Dekel Khimker. I'm 20 years old and serving in the IDF. However, my hard work during service prevents me from following my dream of creating a professional photo album depicting one of the most sacred rituals of mankind. however, with your help i could make ends meet and finally fulfill my passion.</p>
<p>With your support, I can humbly make ends meet. Your financial contributions will be used to travel to exotic and photogenic locations around the country with a buddy of mine who happens to have a teeney-tiny bladder and capture the hi-jinks that ensue. It will also fund a better camera that will enable me to capture artistic urination in stunning quality.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>At the very minimum, we're going to need 500$ to buy a relatively better camera. However, at 1500$ we'll have ourselves a real budget and we will be able to afford a higher quality camera as well as more geographic variety when it comes to photo areas. We may even be able to afford better looking clothes for whoever's peeing in the photo! The possibilities are truly endless!</p>
<p>We intend to release the album digitally online for free for all to witness the glory of people relieving themselves on film. However, we offer attractive incentives to anyone willing to donate to our cause! check out the perks available for your price range.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Potential Issues</h3>
<p>As much as this project may very well change the history of art and photography, serving in the military still takes up a majority of my time. as such, i cannot offer a release date for the album. however, i intend to work on it as seriously as i possibly can! it's my life's calling, after all.</p>

<p>Greta. A five year old diagnosed early January with an incredibly

now part of multiple worldwide medical studies and there is no promise that the
cancer can be fully treated or that it won't come back. It's difficult for
the family and even more so for Greta who is only 5. At 5 years old visual
tools are vital. The images I provide help Greta to ask the right questions,
learn about what's happening to her body and to provide her family with images
of memories that they can look back on. The images will be used as part of recording the medical treatments, progress and details for those in the medical industry to help treat other cases like Gretas, in the future.</p>
<p>The pictures also provide the families huge support network updates on
Greta's progress, her treatments and a behind the
scenes insight. I am honored to be trusted by the family to take such
heartfelt images, it's an honour I don't take lightly.</p>
<p>Greta's treatment plan includes travelling from Vancouver to Boston MA late March 2015 to undergo Proton Therapy. I have been invited to join the
family in Boston for a week, continuing the documenting. In order for me to

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>My name is David C. Hill and I've been a keen photographer since around the age of two, when I captured hundreds of incredible images on my 1976 Fisher Price Pocket Camera. Unfortunately, my parents then had to invest in a pair of clown trousers so the thing could fit in my pocket. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553210041/kf9v8aipdm1qm7qfwfxm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It was around this time that my colouring and retouching skills reached a new level of expertise. Of course, in those days ""photo retouching"" involved drawing a moustache on Felicity Kendal's face with a big fat marker pen - but it must have been evident that I had God-given creative talents. </p>
<p>Some of the work I produced on that camera was Pulitzer Prize winning material. The crème de la crème of photo journalism. </p>
<p>Sadly, disaster struck in 1979 when my family acquired our first dog - a German Shepherd by the name of Max - who ate all my Fisher Price masterpieces. I know, what were the chances?</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552411152/ur676n2mwp3rqkw5odnb.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p>

<p><br/><br/>Max really laid the foundations for my love of dogs, and was the proverbial cherry on top of my already happy childhood. In 1988, shortly after Max passed away, we adopted Ben [the Labrador X] whose arrival coincided with my first real camera. </p>
<p>Ben later became the primary focus of all my photographs, as I'd drop my film into Boots and wait a dog's age for the pictures to be developed. And some of them came out pretty good...</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552417659/rfhus1m75i07zg1mzji2.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

</div><div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>In total I need £3,000 of funding - so let's ""break it down"" (as MC Hammer once said) and be completely transparent and honest about where this money is going.</p>
<p>The DSLR camera. Pretty essential for any professional photographer.</p>
<p>The lenses. Having two or three quality lenses will allow me to adapt to any environment. </p>
<p>Lighting equipment and studio backdrops. Lighting will be required for all the studio shoots, while a green screen background will assist me in post-production.</p>
<p>iPad Pro and Apple Pencil. I concluded that this would be far more cost effective than a Wacom graphics tablet, and a device that can be used for photo retouching and drawing. </p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The perks range from digital images </span><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">to a professional photo shoot, photo books, videos and animations of your pet. And if you don't have a pet yourself then you can </span><font>gift your perk to a friend or family member.</font></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">We all love our pets, and most of them are only around for 15% of our lifetime - and the smaller pets might only bless us with their presence for two or three years. So I'd like to capture them in a series of high quality photos or videos that can be cherished for the rest of your life - and even shared with future generations.</span></p>
</div><div>
<p>In 2016 I funded my book <strong>Lunakita: A Dog Log</strong> via crowd funding, and, although it took a couple of years, it was finally published in December 2018.</p>
<p>The difference here is that it's not going to take me two years to launch the business. If successfully funded in May 2019 then all I need to do is purchase the equipment and I'll be good to go. In fact I already have clients lined up, so I can hit the ground running</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Pet photography isn't about sticking a camera in a dog's face and taking hundreds of photos in the hope that one or two turn out okay. There'll be days when I'll need to lie on my belly in a wet field until I capture the perfect shot... before driving home, caked in mud and fox poop. </p>
<p>In my 44-year lifetime I've never met a dog that doesn't like me, but I'm sure that will change - so I need to be prepared for any situation. I've spent five years with an exceptionally skittish and demanding dog and although I know a lot about animal behaviour it would make sense for me to enrol on an animal behaviour course. </p>
<p>I'd also like to learn the basics of animal first aid, so if I do come across a pet choking or having a seizure at least I'll know what to do.</p>

<p><i>""The indigenous peoples of Brazil face a serious threat to their own survival with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Five centuries ago, these ethnic groups were decimated by diseases brought by European colonizers</i><i>. </i><i>Today with this new scourge spreading rapidly throughout Brazil, native communities, some living in isolation in the Amazon Basin, may disappear completely since they have no means of combating COVID-19.""</i></p>
<p><strong>The petition raised by world-renowned photographer Sebastiao Salgado</strong> (signed by celebrities like Madonna, Meryl Streep, Brad Pitt) is a <strong>wake-up call</strong> to keep our attention high on the extremely difficult situation in the entire Amazon region.</p>
<p><strong>Because of the pandemic, Amazonian indigenous people are even more threatened </strong>by the unscrupulous interests of governments and private companies and illegal traders, that are bringing the epidemic into their territories. Moreover, the coronavirus has become the pretext to further silence their voice, reduce their rights and bring them to their knees leaving them without means of sustenance and adequate health care.</p>
<p>This is why I feel the urgency to give as much voice as possible to Human Forest project, and <strong>I am asking for your support to be louder and louder!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Human Forest project</h3>
</div><div>
<p> </p>
<p>The <strong>Amazon is <i>the green lung of the Earth</i></strong> for everyone. Few consider the fact that it is a place inextricably <strong>connected with human beings</strong> who have lived there for centuries, direct witnesses of its uniqueness and of the ongoing social and environmental upheavals.</p>
<p>At the end of 2017 I embarked on a journey alone with the intention of crossing the Amazon region for two months, from Ecuador to Brazil. In the remote <strong><i>Zòna Intangible</i> of the Yasuní National Park</strong>, created in 1999 to protect the Waorani territory and other indigenous groups - including the Tagaeri and the Taromenani who have chosen to live in voluntary isolation - I met with the<strong> Waorani community of Bameno in the heart of the</strong> <strong>Amazon rainforest of Ecuador, </strong>one of the Latin American countries <strong>most affected by the Coronavirus</strong></p>
<p><strong>First presented to the world in 1956 as ""<i>the worst people on Earth</i>"" by LIFE Magazine</strong>, after the tragic contact attempt covered by the reporter Cornell Capa, then invasively <i>civilized</i> between the sixties and seventies, the Waorani underwent in the arc of only two generations a very strong social and cultural metamorphosis. Today, <strong>the Waorani survive suspended between an ancestral lifestyle of communion with the forest, now compromised, and a predatory modernity, in an indifferent world.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Human Forest centers on people,</strong> in the attempt of overcoming stereotypes about indigenous peoples and <strong>focusing on the inseparable relationship between human beings and the forest in the Amazonian culture</strong>. An invitation to reflect on the profound meaning of the sense of limit and the human condition.</p>
<p><strong>Waorani means ""Humans"". It is from here that I believe we should all start again.</strong></p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Why your support is important</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>My project aims to raise questions and awareness about the history, present and future of the Amazon rainforest and the people who live there, especially now that they are even more threatened by the pandemic of Coronavirus.</p>
<p>I have been invited to exhibit <strong>Human Forest at Milan Photofestival 2020</strong> and this is a great opportunity for the project, an important stage an important step to give it maximum visibility.</p>
<p>The project is <strong>curated by Paola Riccardi</strong> and the exhibition will be hosted <strong>from the 15th to the 31st of October</strong> 2020 at <strong>Galleria Alcentoquarantadue</strong> in Viale Monza 142, Milano.</p>
<p>Organizing a successful solo exhibition for the Milan Photofestival 2020 thou requires a lot of resources, such as printing and framing the 32 photographs, paying the festival fee, renting the gallery space, paying the curator fee, promoting the event and organizing the vernissage.</p>
<p><strong>I am hoping to raise €4.200 to cover all the Milan Photofestival 2020 exhibition expenses</strong><strong> </strong>and the campaign fees (5% Indiegogo fee+ PayPal fees+ bank transaction fees).</p>
<p>The money won't cover any of the costs for traveling to the Amazon region and making Human Forest come true (which I paid by myself), and I'm not trying to get any profit out of it either.</p>
<p>In exchange for your support, you'll be able to choose between some amazing rewards: they're all listed on the right, so pick your favorite! </p>
<p>I also hope to be able to move my exhibition out of Italy, increasing awareness about the indigenous people that live in the Amazon Rainforest and the injustices they are subject to, using my photographs to ignite the discussion. So, any extra funds raised beyond the campaign goal will help me carrying out the next steps in order to bring my exhibition to audiences around the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>If you care, share!</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The main ingredient of any crowdfunding is people! So, please, help me sharing the campaign with your friends and families on social media (using the buttons on the top of the page). Let people know about the Human Forest project!</p>
<p>Even if you're unable to contribute financially today, <strong>you can still make a huge difference spreading the word about this campaign.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thank you in advance from the bottom of my heart! </strong>I am incredibly grateful to you for believing in my project and supporting my exhibition. I hope to meet you in Milan!</p>

<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>Ciao! My name is <strong>Marina Tana</strong> and I was born in Pavia (Italy) in 1979. I like to describe myself as a renaissance person, or this is at least how I try to justify my many passions. I am an engineer, a manager, a Philosophy scholar, but above all <strong>I am a passionate traveler, photographer and storyteller. </strong></p>
<p>I unexpectedly began to travel alone in 2014, approaching photography as a further space for reflection and personal research, an enhanced gaze capable of creating an intimate contact between the solo traveler and the surrounding natural and human environment.</p>
<p>My travels spring from the desire to observe how humans and territory have influenced each other over time, developing a multiplicity of cultural, spiritual and environmental interrelationships.</p>
<p>I am particularly interested in cultural and visual stereotypes, and in the decolonization of Arts.</p>

<h3>""Chaps, I'm kicking around an idea for a Leek Blues Festival sometime in October""</h3>
<p>This message appeared on my facebook page early in 2013, I knew very little about Blues music and had only photographed half a dozen gigs, and was now being asked to help arrange Leek's first Blues Festival, along with a group of artists and music fans. </p>
<p>Now nearly 5 years later I'm sitting here looking at the latest lineup for the 5th festival with around 20 venues and 50+ bands</p>
<p>I'm also now a big fan of Blues music, in awe of all the performers I've seen over the past few years, extremely proud to have been a small part of the group that organizes the event and even prouder of my home town for supporting the whole thing in such a big way.</p>
<h3>The Plan</h3>
<p>Using the pictures taken over the last 4 years, we aim to mount a free exhibition during the festival, using at least 2 of the venues, if not more, to display the pictures. The higher the sum of money raised the more pictures can go into the venues.</p>
<h3>What you get</h3>
<p>There are a number perks but the main one is that you get one of the pictures from the exhibition, you get to choose the picture, it is then printed on canvas and displayed during the festival. Once the exhibition is finished your picture will be sent to you.</p>

<br/>About me </h3><p>I’m an emerging visual artist based in Amsterdam, currently studying at Gerrit Rietveld Academie. My work in mix-media, with a strong interest in photography, expresses the relationship between man and (natural) environment, the Universe and the laws governing order. I’m interested in the human psyche and our existence on the globe, which strongly reflects onto my art.  When conducting research, I focus on the activities of humankind and their indivisible bonds with the ambience. This explores how the achievements of civilization are bound up with the consequences of pursuing progress. Nature is my inspiration and reference point. In my life, I look for a balance between its soothingness and vibrant urbanism, so do I in art.  </p><p> </p><h3>About the project</h3><p>Two of my projects: solo expo and single photo, were selected for <strong>Rotterdam Photo Festival 2020</strong>, which takes place during The Art Rotterdam Week. One of the images is shown during<br/><strong>World Press Photo Rotterdam</strong>. As a young artist, this is a huge opportunity for international exposure and growing my network. I want to take advantage of these chances, thrive and push my career further. <br/>It appears challenging, considering the scale and gravity of the events, yet my previous artistic<br/>experience ensures me to feel confident.</p><p><br/><u><strong>Outside in </strong></u><br/>An attempt to interpret the relationship between man as both an individual and a part of society. The spectacle of a single man trapped in the realms of the contemporary world and the expression of continuous existential pain in an anaesthetized surrounding. A series of photographs as a negative criticism of the rapid economic progress, consumerism, capitalism and indifference to the detriment of the individual.</p><p><br/><strong><u>Mind Traverses</u></strong><br/>A reflection on the current transition in the way of living, thinking and a positive assessment on the direction of the development that considers not only modernity but also nature and its sources. A joint venture of both appears to be a quintessential solution helping to resolve issues faced currently by humankind; without causing harm for milieu. </p><h3>
<br/>Support me </h3><p>To execute my ideas I need your (financial) help. All the funds collected here will be spent on<br/>production and promotion costs. A section of the funds will be paid to the organization, to help run and create these beautiful events. By donating to my project you support not only me but the whole photography community consisting of amateurs, professionals, artists, promoters and everyone who loves lens arts ☺</p><p><i>“As a small independent organization that consists of passionate photography freelancers, we want to create a platform that caters to a wide spectrum of photographers. However, we cannot make it work without your financial contribution as we are only partially funded. With your contribution, we cover organizational, productional and promotional costs to make sure your work is facilitated and promoted in the best way possible""</i> </p><p style=""text-align: right;"">-Rotterdam Photo Festival</p><p>Every backer can choose a perk: a digital hug or physical postcard/poster with the photo selected for the shows (first in the gallery up above).

My work in mix-media, with a strong interest in photography, expresses the relationship between man and (natural) environment, the Universe and the laws governing order. I’m interested in the human psyche and our existence on the globe, which strongly reflects onto my art.  When conducting research, I focus on the activities of humankind and their indivisible bonds with the ambience. This explores how the achievements of civilization are bound up with the consequences of pursuing progress. Nature is my inspiration and reference point. In my life, I look for a balance between its soothingness and vibrant urbanism, so do I in art.   About the projectTwo of my projects: solo expo and single photo, were selected for Rotterdam Photo Festival 2020, which takes place during The Art Rotterdam Week. One of the images is shown duringWorld Press Photo Rotterdam. As a young artist, this is a huge opportunity for international exposure and growing my network. I want to take advantage of these chances, thrive and push my career further. It appears challenging, considering the scale and gravity of the events, yet my previous artisticexperience ensures me to feel confident.Outside in An attempt to interpret the relationship between man as both an individual and a part of society. The spectacle of a single man trapped in the realms of the contemporary world and the expression of continuous existential pain in an anaesthetized surrounding. A series of photographs as a negative criticism of the rapid economic progress, consumerism, capitalism and indifference to the detriment of the individual.Mind TraversesA reflection on the current transition in the way of living, thinking and a positive assessment on the direction of the development that considers not only modernity but also nature and its sources. A joint venture of both appears to be a quintessential solution helping to resolve issues faced currently by humankind; without causing harm for milieu. 
Support me To execute my ideas I need your (financial) help. All the funds collected here will be spent onproduction and promotion costs. A section of the funds will be paid to the organization, to help run and create these beautiful events. By donating to my project you support not only me but the whole photography community consisting of amateurs, professionals, artists, promoters and everyone who loves lens arts ☺“As a small independent organization that consists of passionate photography freelancers, we want to create a platform that caters to a wide spectrum of photographers. However, we cannot make it work without your financial contribution as we are only partially funded. With your contribution, we cover organizational, productional and promotional costs to make sure your work is facilitated and promoted in the best way possible"" -Rotterdam Photo FestivalEvery backer can choose a perk: a digital hug or physical postcard/poster with the photo selected for the shows (first in the gallery up above). Every cent counts. Though if you cannot support financially, you can still help me out; by sharing this page on your social media, following my profile or visiting the exhibitions. The opening takes place on the 6th of February. Everyone is welcome!More info:

For 28, years our partnership continues to be a successful journey of education and accomplishment. Starting here on the Space Coast to outside LA in California and the Big City of New York. Finally, we have returned home to strengthen and support our family. For the past 14 years, we have been active in supporting the Deaf community. Working as America Sign Language Interpreters, our work has focused on educational interpreting.Upon returning home to Florida, we have realized that there needs to be more control in the direction of our future path. For that reason, We have formed Fototropix Photography to create a business to work together to provide the needed attention to the family.With this in mind, CC and I have decided to ""jump in with both feet"" into the Art community by setting up a fine art photography vendor booth in the Cocoa Village Art Fair this October. Our Campaign objective is to raise funds to print the needed images, mount them, Display material like tables and Art walls, and pay for our space in the fair itself. For years, we have been observers of the art fairs in Cocoa Village. Now to present our art in Cocoa Village will be a way toYour support will not only help us purchase prints and display materials. Each one of your donations will go a long way in substantiating us, not just as photographers but as an artist. Be a part of our story when we get to the fair. We are ecstatic to be on the “other “ side of the booth, this time. What is our goal and how we give backWe are seeking $1,000 to purchase items that will make the booth successful. The supplies that need to be acquired are tables and art walls for presenting the photographs properly. However, the lion's share of the expenses will be used on printing and mounting the photosIn exchange for your investment in us, we are showing our appreciation through our art. We know our perks are materially valuable but  a piece of our creative heart as well. We also offer supporters the opportunity to be the patron of a print collection and list their name with that work's title. As ""This series of prints for this image sponsored by... "". And as a crowdfunding supporter, you will be provided a discount on future purchases of our work.
Fototropix and Success 
 Realistically in business, failure can be the outcome. We feel the 1st challenge is not to view this project as having our dream funded. Because if a dream never comes to life.  That's fine ""it was only a dream, to begin with."". However, we view this project as a real-life means to direct our journey with our family. When it was our determination to move out west. CC and I decided to build a tiny house. With limited building experience. What we didn't know we learned. What we didn't have, we made. The build was successful, driving it from Florida to California. After living in it for 2 years, we sold it to fund our move to NY. Determination and tenacity continue to be the fuel for our success. Other Ways You Can Support the JourneyEach one of you can help with this Campaign.

photographer, brought up at the foot of the TianMu Mountains(天目山), where wild ginkgos have been existing for hundreds of millions of years.</p><p align=""left"">I learned my craft through apprenticeship to an outstanding disciple of the late master Chinese painter Shoutian Pan (潘天寿). My works have been published and exhibited internationally.</p><h3 align=""left""> </h3><h2 align=""left""><strong>Why I Created this Book</strong></h2><p align=""left"">God created the earth, where dinosaurs and ginkgos flourished. After the biological mass extinction 65 million years ago, plus the Quaternary glaciers which swept across the planet 2 million years ago, most forms of animals and plants disappeared. One species of ginkgo tree survived in sheltered mountainous areas in east China. I am lucky enough to be a native.</p><p align=""left"">The purpose of this book is to promote public awareness towards ginkgo, linked to the primitive nature. Discover and share wonders of Nature.</p><p align=""left"">The oldest ginkgo in the West (in Netherlands) is less than 300 years old, while there are some ginkgos in China over 3,000 years old. Here is one over 1,500 years old, situated at the top of Wuyun Mountain, Hangzhou, China.</p><p align=""left""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476147251/gosmyac3hwmrme0l5xhg.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3 align=""left""><strong>So Many Stories about Ginkgo</strong></h3><p align=""left"">I recall a treat of my childhood, after my mother cooked rice with wood, I used to throw ginkgo nuts into these hot ashes, and after a short while the nuts cracked like a song, they were delicious. </p><p align=""left""><strong>Tell You a Secret--How Male and Female Ginkgos Date:</strong></p><p align=""left"">We all know male and female ginkgos are separate trees. There are no bees involved as go-betweens. In spring, pollen cones grow on male trees while the ovule develops on the females. Carried by the wind, pollen travels miles across hills and rivers, meanwhile the ovule sends out a drop of liquid on the top to catch pollen passing by.</p><p align=""left""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477012887/lroka2ec5axniwieh9ox.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p align=""left"">After meeting, the drop retreats and leads the way for pollen to settle down in the growing pollen tube, where sperms develop. Later in autumn matured sperms leave the tube and swim to the egg, which is developed in the ovule, making the actual fertilization to produce an embryo.</p><p align=""left"">Due to the environment blessed with so many ginkgos, folks usually live long lives. This 102-year-old great-great-grandma often wins money when playing Mahjong (麻将) with others.</p><p align=""left""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477219615/xaaiiwqm3zi26slstabe.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p align=""left""> </p><p align=""left""><strong>Lots more fascinating stories like:</strong></p><p align=""left"">--A 2,000-year-old ginkgo transformed into a smart scholar, he got an engagement with the princess... 银杏变秀才，皇帝找驸马</p><p align=""left"">--An old tomb under a 1000-year-old ginkgo...古银杏树下惊现古墓</p><p align=""left"">--With a couple ginkgos, the dying female (wife) saved the male ginkgo (husband) magically...</p><p align=""left"">危难关头，雌树银杏（妻子）舍身救雄树（丈夫）</p><p align=""left"">...</p><p align=""left""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476762806/zbzqecmdsszyzldcuo9k.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p align=""left"">While designing the book, ginkgo lent me a lot of inspiration.

My works have been published and exhibited internationally. Why I Created this BookGod created the earth, where dinosaurs and ginkgos flourished. After the biological mass extinction 65 million years ago, plus the Quaternary glaciers which swept across the planet 2 million years ago, most forms of animals and plants disappeared. One species of ginkgo tree survived in sheltered mountainous areas in east China. I am lucky enough to be a native.The purpose of this book is to promote public awareness towards ginkgo, linked to the primitive nature. Discover and share wonders of Nature.The oldest ginkgo in the West (in Netherlands) is less than 300 years old, while there are some ginkgos in China over 3,000 years old. Here is one over 1,500 years old, situated at the top of Wuyun Mountain, Hangzhou, China.So Many Stories about GinkgoI recall a treat of my childhood, after my mother cooked rice with wood, I used to throw ginkgo nuts into these hot ashes, and after a short while the nuts cracked like a song, they were delicious. Tell You a Secret--How Male and Female Ginkgos Date:We all know male and female ginkgos are separate trees. There are no bees involved as go-betweens. In spring, pollen cones grow on male trees while the ovule develops on the females. Carried by the wind, pollen travels miles across hills and rivers, meanwhile the ovule sends out a drop of liquid on the top to catch pollen passing by.After meeting, the drop retreats and leads the way for pollen to settle down in the growing pollen tube, where sperms develop. Later in autumn matured sperms leave the tube and swim to the egg, which is developed in the ovule, making the actual fertilization to produce an embryo.Due to the environment blessed with so many ginkgos, folks usually live long lives. This 102-year-old great-great-grandma often wins money when playing Mahjong (麻将) with others. Lots more fascinating stories like:--A 2,000-year-old ginkgo transformed into a smart scholar, he got an engagement with the princess... 银杏变秀才，皇帝找驸马--An old tomb under a 1000-year-old ginkgo...古银杏树下惊现古墓--With a couple ginkgos, the dying female (wife) saved the male ginkgo (husband) magically...危难关头，雌树银杏（妻子）舍身救雄树（丈夫）...While designing the book, ginkgo lent me a lot of inspiration. In fact, I imitate a lot of its characteristics, that’s clear, straightforward, and graceful (I wish).I got invaluable help from a lot of professionals, Australian Chinese bilingual poet Sherry Chan （陈尚慧） contributed the translation of ancient Chinese poems into English, Dr. Yusheng (Christopher) Liu (刘裕生教授),Tenured Professor of Botany at Prairie View A&M University, U.S.A., kindly edited the book. My old Canadian friend, Ernie Grimo, founding president in 1972 and recently re-elected President of the Society of Ontario Nut Growers, has always been a helping hand when in need at early stage of this book several years ago, and many more...Covering chapters like About Ginkgo, Oldest Ginkgos, Wonders, Poems, Folk Remedies, Symbols, Legends, Memorabilia, etc. The nearly 160 images are extracted from two decades’ work.

<h3>Thanks for visiting my campaign</h3>
<p>I appreciate you taking the time to view this campaign. I'm Nathan, an American photographer working in the southern United States. I've been in this business for about eight years now and have a degree in digital photography. I have been privileged over the years to get to make many beautiful images, but now for the first time I'm taking a stab and doing this full-time. It has been my dream ever since I started exploring this field to be a full time nude photographer, and now I think I have an opportunity to make it my reality. </p>
<p>My ultimate goal is to launch a Patreon for my nude work, a place where fans can find a full collection of my work online, as well as behind-the-scenes features, lighting and editing tutorials, prints, posters, wallpapers, and more. The content on my Patreon site will be full and varied: black and white nudes, full-color, art, glamour,steamy boudoir, cosplay and superheroes, and anything else that sparks my imagination. But before I can launch the Patreon, I've got to start making the content, which is the purpose of this campaign. I would like to launch with no fewer than eight full sets complete and ready to go, with at least two more in production at the time of launch, and I hope to launch by the end of the year. I could use some help meeting that goal.</p>
<p>I decided to do this for several reasons, the biggest and most important being because I love to shoot nudes, but there's more to it than just that. I have a gift and I intend to share it. Art isn't created in a vacuum, and it is meant to be shared with an audience. This will give me a perfect platform for doing that. I've gotten tired of being able to make the things that I can make and simply not being able to do it, whether it be from lack of time, locations, or money. This is an opportunity for me to do something different. To exercise autonomy, to put my time and effort into making things that are, first and foremost, creatively fulfilling, and secondly, my own and to my own benefit. It means living and creating on my terms.</p>
<p>Contributions to this campaign will help me do that. Art takes energy and passion and, unfortunately for most artists, it often takes money, too. If I can completely fund this campaign it will mean that I can throw myself fully into the creative process and not be constrained or hampered by lack of time, resources, or funding. That's huge. Ask any artist. Ask them what it's like when all the things they have restraining them are taken away and they can simply create. It leads to really powerful works of art. I'm going to do this one way or another, but with help from you I can do it much sooner, and that's what I'm asking for with this campaign. Help me get from where I am now to where I'm going. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What's in it for contributors?</h3>
<p>As you can see from the top of the page, my campaign goal is $7,000. Almost all of that money will go towards actually doing the photoshoots necessary to create my content. I already have most of the gear required to get this done, there are only two specific and relatively inexpensive pieces of gear that I'm looking to add. One is an Instax camera so that I can offer unique, one-of-a-kind instaprints to contributors to this campaign and future patrons, the other is a GoPro for doing behind-the-scenes videos of my shoots, which will be available as extras later on if I can get the funding. Everything else goes directly into the shoot budget, which breaks down into three areas: model fees, hair and makeup services, and location rental (when applicable). Full funding will allow me to create the eight sets I want to have in place at launch, as well as a few sets of additional post-launch content.</p>
<p>So what do you get if you contribute? Full details of the reward tiers are listed to the right, but everyone who donates gets access to all of the sets I shoot for this content ramp-up, everything I make to prepare for launch. What about post-launch content? Anyone who makes a contribution of $10 or more to help me get this initial content created gets access to everything I shoot, pre- and post-launch, for life. So that's not just the initial eight or so sets, but every set I shoot for  Patreon, at no extra charge, forever. Higher tier donors will also get things like prints, posters, behind-the-scenes content, and even tutorials for you photo enthusiasts out there. Check the reward tiers on the right for full details.</p>
<p>One of the great things about this type of project is that it doesn't have to reach full funding to get rolling. Even if I don't meet my total goal I can still start creating photos, sharing them with contributors, and preparing the site for launch. Everything goes into getting pictures and extra content made, and I can start sharing it out with contributors even before I launch my Patreon.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Making photography can be funding-intensive, and the funding required can vary differently from shoot to shoot. I can expect to spend $500 minimum per shoot, and many times more than that. Going it alone will be slow, but I'll get it done. However, with your support I can work much faster and much more frequently, which will help me to maintain creative flow and put plenty of sexy art in your hands. I'm very excited by the prospect of spending the fall shooting and creating art, and if you would help me do that I would be so grateful.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>When do we start?</h3>
<p>Almost everything I need to achieve these goals is in place. I have the equipment, I have plenty of wonderful models ready to work, I live in an area with a wealth of great shooting locations. All that's missing is the funding to get it underway. I'm really looking forward to shooting my pictures and connecting with fans, sharing what I create, and seeing where all of this takes me. Please do become a donor, get yourself some cool rewards, and be a part of my creative process. If you've already made a contribution, or if you simply can't right now but want to see this project succeed, help me out by sharing it on social media. The bigger the audience I can reach the sooner I can start shooting. Do something kickass today and help me out.</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","Thanks for visiting my campaign
I appreciate you taking the time to view this campaign. I'm Nathan, an American photographer working in the southern United States. I've been in this business for about eight years now and have a degree in digital photography. I have been privileged over the years to get to make many beautiful images, but now for the first time I'm taking a stab and doing this full-time. It has been my dream ever since I started exploring this field to be a full time nude photographer, and now I think I have an opportunity to make it my reality. 
My ultimate goal is to launch a Patreon for my nude work, a place where fans can find a full collection of my work online, as well as behind-the-scenes features, lighting and editing tutorials, prints, posters, wallpapers, and more. The content on my Patreon site will be full and varied: black and white nudes, full-color, art, glamour,steamy boudoir, cosplay and superheroes, and anything else that sparks my imagination. But before I can launch the Patreon, I've got to start making the content, which is the purpose of this campaign. I would like to launch with no fewer than eight full sets complete and ready to go, with at least two more in production at the time of launch, and I hope to launch by the end of the year. I could use some help meeting that goal.

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Where your money will go:</h3>
<p><strong>All money raised in this campaign will go towards the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The actual printing costs for 1,000 copies of the book</li>
<li>Costs for English translation</li>
<li>Final mobile app development, record, and edit of the videos</li>
<li>The cost of fulfilling perks (packaging, shipping)</li>

</ul>
<p>We will do our best to send the rewards to you at the <strong>estimated time - October 2017 or earlier</strong>. If there are delays in production I will promptly inform you.</p>
<p><strong>Due to the many pages - 400, and the complexity of the project, we will need at least 8600$ to start production. If we do not reach the full amount needed to finalize the project we will not be able to translate, publish and deliver the book. </strong></p>

<p>I’m in an altered state in the midst of bizarre earth forms: in hoodoo-populated badlands, on rock beaches, standing over breathtaking canyons, exploring the <i>tafoni</i> on the California coast, wandering in sandstone wonderlands—I’ve actively sought such places out around the world.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I know my way around my camera, and the kind of light I’m looking for, so I manage to express my wonder and amazement in photographic art. Actually, I've been doing photography since 1960 and been a professional since 2002, with many gallery shows and publications to my credit.</p>
<p>I've finally compiled my best images of earth forms into my dream book. It’s big: 12x12-inch hard cover, 120 pages with four fold-out panoramas. This book collects photos from the most amazing geological sites in Wales, Newfoundland, Arizona, the Dakotas, California, Alaska, New Mexico, Idaho, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, Cappadocia (Turkey), Jordan, Madagascar, Tibet, Mongolia, Vietnam, Italy, Iceland, and Ireland. </p>
<p>The Earth is a continuous wonder for me and has been all my life (through two other professions, academia and jazz piano). One of my missions is to spread appreciation of the spectacular lesser known treasures of the planet. I want more people to travel to see these natural wonders and to appreciate the small scale as well as the large scale ones, and to be willing to explore on their own, outside of organized tours, and make their own discoveries (even right around the corner).</p>
<p>And I want this love, admiration, respect and awe for our planet to fuel our efforts to preserve her for future generations—and preserve us, too. This often means opposing extractive or development projects undertaken for large profits that damage the environment.</p>
<p>Now, the people who are on the cutting edge of this preservation effort and frequently in conflict with the developers are often indigenous peoples around the world. Although they make up only about 22% of the world’s population, they watch over 85% of its environmental diversity. The most dramatic recent confrontation has been at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota starting in November 2016. Along with millions of others, I was deeply moved by the courage of the Water Protectors, who peacefully protested, standing up up to the state militia and private military contractors who branded them “jihadist terrorists” and attacked them mercilessly. They were arrested en masse for their trouble, and now the <strong>Lakota People’s Law Project</strong>, run by the Romero Institute, a public interest non-profit out of Santa Cruz, CA, has undertaken to defend them and to dispel the lies that framed them by simply bringing out the truth. The director of the Romero Institute, public-interest super-lawyer <strong>Daniel Sheehan</strong>, has contributed an extended essay that tells the whole story of the Water Protectors and the mendacity of the oil company. Lakota lawyer <strong>Chase Iron Eyes</strong> has contributed a powerful poem; NY Times photography critic <strong>Lyle Rexer</strong> evaluates the originality of my work; and British science writer <strong>John Farndon</strong> contributes a powerful appeal to support environmental causes—since our life depends on them—and the Water Protectors in particular, suggesting that the images in the book will help inspire us to do so.</p>
<p>I will be donating about a third of funds raised to create the book, minus administrative costs, to defend the Water Protectors. Danny Sheehan is confident that the power of truth will prevail against money and bought political power, so a contribution to their defense will most likely bring very tangible results in the struggle. Their vindication of the Water Protectors will be a major step in the preservation of the integrity of the Earth and the fight against climate change.</p>
<p>A contribution of $35 plus shipping gets you this beautiful book,  and $10 of that supports the Water Protectors' legal defense fund (the Lakota People's Law Project) at the same time, thereby helping to preserve the Earth that is celebrated in the book.</p>
<p>A larger contribution can get you breathtaking art prints to beautify your space and share some of my altered state whenever you contemplate them.</p>
<p>I’m setting my goal at $20,000, since that’s the minimum of what I’d need to have the first 1000 copies printed. If I exceed the goal in this 30-day campaign, then I can begin to fulfill my pledge to the Lakota People’s Law Project. If not, then I’ll do that through sales after the campaign ends.</p>
<p>My largest project before this one was an encyclopedic CD-ROM on the history of jazz piano, featuring the great multi-stylist, Dick Hyman (b. 1927). It came out in 1999 and sold worldwide (and the NY Times named it one of the 13 best CD-ROMs of that year). Before that, I got my PhD in comparative literature at Brown, and after that I curated a 325-work show featuring 125 photographers in 2007 at the Williamsburg Art and Historical Center in Brooklyn. Called “Sun Pictures to Mega-Pixels.” It featured original photographic processes, mostly from before and after the standard silver-gelatin process. So I have some experience in large-scale original art projects. (The CD-ROM catalogue is still available for $20, including shipping).</p>
<p>So if you love <strong>photography that shows what you've never seen before</strong>, if you’re fascinated by <strong>earth forms</strong>, if you like to be <strong>amazed and surprised</strong> by the natural world, if you love to get lost in photo art books that make you dream and take you on <strong>vicarious journeys</strong>, if you feel that it’s urgent to work to limit our fossil fuel consumption and <strong>prevent climate change</strong>, if you support the <strong>rights of indigenous people</strong> to live unmolested in integrity with their environment, if you believe we have much to learn from both the <strong>spirituality and sustainability strategies of Native peoples</strong>, then you will probably really enjoy this book.</p>
<p>I’ve also include a geological time scale with page reference numbers to each of the land form subjects depicted in the book, as well as an explanation of the geological origins of each formation in the end next to a thumbnail of the image.</p>

<h3>UPDATE:</h3>
<p>I made the mistake to not create enough buzz before I started this campaign. I will try to publish the book next year. If you want to be notified when I maybe achieve this, drop me a message to info@tinozimmermann.com and will get back to you :-)</p>
<p>Thank you :-)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I started taking photos when I had a psychosis, a serious mental condition one usually doesn't recover from. In my case it was partly caused by drugs. I got involved with drugs very early - around the age of 12 - and things went downhill from there.</p>
<p>With 21 I turned myself in to the psychiatric hospital and the prospects they gave were basically life-long medication. I didn't want that and left the hospital against the doctors recommendation.</p>
<p>Living back with my parents in the same small town I grew up in, I couldn't work a job but needed something to do and by chance I started taking photos with an old camera a friend had gifted me.</p>
<p>The following years I obsessed myself with taking photos and reading about photography as it helped me to cope with my condition. In 2016 I got accepted for studying photography, which was a huge achievement for me, and there I started to sort and edit the huge archive of photos I had taken over the last years. The idea to make a book out of it started to grow upon me and so I spent the last 3 years doing that.</p>
<p><strong><u>Book Specifications:</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>456 Pages, 632 Images, Text. Hardcover, Sewn Binding, High Quality Printing</strong></p>
<p><b>Dimensions: approx 32 x 21 x 4 cm (DIN A4), weight approx 1,6 kg.</b></p>
<p>The book itself is a reflection about growing up, about raising and supporting children, about learning photography and about change.</p>
<p>You can find an in-depth description and more details below.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To realize this book in a small edition of around 300 copies I need around 15.000 € to cover the costs of printing, shipping and distributing, which is an insane amount of money to me. </p>
<p>I don't want to accept any donations, I just want people who are into this kind of art/photography to get a really good book which they can look at often and maybe get inspired by frequently. I wanted this book to have the quality of a huge collections of prints, so the print quality is quite good and the feel of the book is like huge photo-album.</p>
<p>Below, there is also a full video of the complete book.</p>

<p>I grew up in Germanys least populated region, in a small town in former East-Germany, shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall.</p>
<p>I had actually a really good childhood but around the age of 11 or 12 I made first contact with drugs and things went downhill from there.</p>

<p>When I had a psychosis, with 21, I tried to recover from it and by chance I started getting into photography. I buried myself with trying out every aspect of it and learning about it. I bought and sold used cameras off of ebay with the little money I had and even build my own cameras.</p>
<p>I looked for good photographers but couldn't find much that appealed me so I spent most of my time on Flickr, looking at other amateur photographers work.</p>

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>My Name is Tino Zimmermann and since last year I'm studying Art at the Academy of Arts in Karlsruhe, Germany. Before that, I briefly studied Photography (for 2 years) and before that I didn't do much except trying to recover from my, let's call it, 'unlucky youth'.</p>
<p>I spend the last 3 years working on this book and it's an incredible feeling that this is finally done. I want to become an artist and this is kind of like my first work so I would be happy if you support me and get yourself a copy.</p>
<p>I won't be making a huge profit off this, the whole thing is actually more about putting a very unique type of book out there. I decided to make this book as good as it gets, no matter how long that might take. Professional publishers have to cut costs everywhere and things like print quality tend to suffer from that. I am self publishing and distributing it because I want to avoid these things.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>A photo book is not the best medium to raise awareness on topics because it is kind of niche product but I think that this book might change the way you look at your children growing up and following their passions, even if it seems like it is about an entirely different topic.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There's not much risk involved. When the campaign is over I will look at how much has been raised and look if the book can go into production regardless.

Short Summary
I started taking photos when I had a psychosis, a serious mental condition one usually doesn't recover from. In my case it was partly caused by drugs. I got involved with drugs very early - around the age of 12 - and things went downhill from there.
With 21 I turned myself in to the psychiatric hospital and the prospects they gave were basically life-long medication. I didn't want that and left the hospital against the doctors recommendation.
Living back with my parents in the same small town I grew up in, I couldn't work a job but needed something to do and by chance I started taking photos with an old camera a friend had gifted me.
The following years I obsessed myself with taking photos and reading about photography as it helped me to cope with my condition. In 2016 I got accepted for studying photography, which was a huge achievement for me, and there I started to sort and edit the huge archive of photos I had taken over the last years. The idea to make a book out of it started to grow upon me and so I spent the last 3 years doing that.
Book Specifications:
456 Pages, 632 Images, Text. Hardcover, Sewn Binding, High Quality Printing
Dimensions: approx 32 x 21 x 4 cm (DIN A4), weight approx 1,6 kg.
The book itself is a reflection about growing up, about raising and supporting children, about learning photography and about change.
You can find an in-depth description and more details below.

What I Need & What You Get
To realize this book in a small edition of around 300 copies I need around 15.000 € to cover the costs of printing, shipping and distributing, which is an insane amount of money to me. 
I don't want to accept any donations, I just want people who are into this kind of art/photography to get a really good book which they can look at often and maybe get inspired by frequently. I wanted this book to have the quality of a huge collections of prints, so the print quality is quite good and the feel of the book is like huge photo-album.
Below, there is also a full video of the complete book.

More Details About the Book and this Projects Background
 

                                                                                                                                                              (Page 6-7)
I grew up in Germanys least populated region, in a small town in former East-Germany, shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
I had actually a really good childhood but around the age of 11 or 12 I made first contact with drugs and things went downhill from there.
 

                                                                                                                                                         (Page 86-87)
When I had a psychosis, with 21, I tried to recover from it and by chance I started getting into photography. I buried myself with trying out every aspect of it and learning about it. I bought and sold used cameras off of ebay with the little money I had and even build my own cameras.
I looked for good photographers but couldn't find much that appealed me so I spent most of my time on Flickr, looking at other amateur photographers work.

                                                                                                                                                         (Page 100-101)

About Me
My Name is Tino Zimmermann and since last year I'm studying Art at the Academy of Arts in Karlsruhe, Germany. Before that, I briefly studied Photography (for 2 years) and before that I didn't do much except trying to recover from my, let's call it, 'unlucky youth'.
I spend the last 3 years working on this book and it's an incredible feeling that this is finally done. I want to become an artist and this is kind of like my first work so I would be happy if you support me and get yourself a copy.
I won't be making a huge profit off this, the whole thing is actually more about putting a very unique type of book out there. I decided to make this book as good as it gets, no matter how long that might take. Professional publishers have to cut costs everywhere and things like print quality tend to suffer from that. I am self publishing and distributing it because I want to avoid these things.
The Impact
A photo book is not the best medium to raise awareness on topics because it is kind of niche product but I think that this book might change the way you look at your children growing up and following their passions, even if it seems like it is about an entirely different topic.

Risks & Challenges
There's not much risk involved. When the campaign is over I will look at how much has been raised and look if the book can go into production regardless. Even if the funding goal hasn't been met fully, it might still enable me to get a credit from my bank to fund the production. And if everything fails, you'll simply get your money back and a 'thank you' nontheless.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you know people who are into this kind of photography/art/book-style, it would be huge help to me if you recommend my work and maybe encourage them to support this project.
I don't expect much over all but sometimes little miracles happen.
Thank you!! :-)

<p>Hi world!</p>
<p>I’m Nadia Romanova, photographer and graphic designer. I’m a Modern Art and Nature lover, born in Lithuania, so have spent lots of time near the Baltic sea. One day I realised that the surrounding Nature creates pure Art  and often better than Art created by humans. Since I’m a photographer, I'm started to capture it with my camera before it disappears. Mother Nature is the greatest artist and creates infinite works of art in various styles and techniques. It can be abstract, minimalist, surrealism etc. All I needed was to see it and put it into a frame. So was born my first image collection of Nature Art “Sea and Sand games”. I printed some pictures on canvas for my apartment and visiting friends started asking me to make pictures for them too, to help refresh their houses and offices. Later I made the site romanovapictures.com to make it for them to choose pictures for their interiors. Today I’m happy to present you with some pictures from my Nature Art collections. I want to share with world the works of art created by the biggest Artist – Nature itself. I would be happy if you would support my project and add artworks created by our beautiful Earth to your interiors.</p>

<p>Welcome to this fundraising page of my first ever photo book - <strong>""The Land""</strong>.</p>
<p>My name is Stanislav Strilets, and I am a professional photographer and journalist from Ukraine. </p>
<p>Last 2 years I've spent in Indonesia, learning batik, traditional painting, and crafts in both Java and Bali. Living in Indonesia made a huge impact on my professional life. Being a student at the Institute of Arts, I had a great opportunity to explore the traditional life and farming process of Javanese farmers. During my field studies, I faced a complicated universe, consisting of deep philosophy, authentic methods of labor and vast knowledge of the natural environment. Still being away from the influence of civilization, Javanese farmers follow animistic cults and consider the Land as a sacred gift of the Universe.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>I have spent much of my retirement traveling around south Texas photographing denizens of the ""Brush Country"", as we Texans call it.  This diverse region makes a home for hundreds of plants and animals, many that can be found nowhere else north of Mexico.</p>
<p>My hope is to share these images with others (especially children) so that they might be inspired to greater appreciation of the wild treasures all around us.</p>
<p>The first toe-in-the-water is the creation of a 2018 Wildlife Calendar using 13 of my recent nature photographs.  I have kept this campaign modest in both its goals and in its required funding.</p>
<p>Please read on to get a full understanding of what we can achieve together.</p>
<p><strong>Present Status of the Project</strong></p>
<p>The hard work of the project is complete.  The photography is done and the post processing of the images is finished.  A printing company has been selected and all the images have been resized to match the printer's guidelines. The complete calendar layout has been uploaded to the printing company and proofed and is ready for me to fill in the number of calendars that I need and click on the ""Purchase"" button.  Below, is a screen capture image of what the January Page will look like (of course the actual calendar will have much higher resolution).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491230747/jnzk00km7czvbx2abvcn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I have included images that will appear on the cover (and for all the month-pages) at the end of this section.</p>
<p><strong>Goals and Objectives</strong></p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong>  My goal is to use my nature photography to gently nudge others toward a closer relationship with the wild animals and plants all around us.</p>
<p><strong>Objective (1 - completed):</strong>  To select 13 images from my recent field work that present animals and plants in an up close and personal way.</p>
<p><strong>Objective (2 - completed):</strong>  To select a high-quality printing company that specializes in calendars and prepare a prototype version of a 28-page 2018 calendar using the 13 wildlife images.</p>
<p><strong>Objective (3 - completed):</strong>  To create a compelling Indiegogo campaign to raise the funds to have the calendar printed.  Of course whether the campaign is ""compelling"" will be measured by the level of funding provided by my backers.</p>
<p><strong>Objective (4):</strong>  After the minimum funding level has been reached, to get the calendars in the hands of, and before the eyes of, my backers.</p>
<p><strong>Objective (5):</strong>  To raise funding as far as possible above the minimum necessary to fulfill my obligation to the backers.  This extra funding will allow me to provide the calendars ""free of charge"" to many schools and libraries in my state.  Young people are the future and they are the individuals I most want to engage with my photography.</p>
<p>If these five objectives are completed successfully, much progress toward satisfying my goal will be assured.</p>
<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>I have calculated the cost of this project and established a break even point ($1600).  The break even point will be the fixed funding level target for this campaign.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491492116/wjdzrwhcvj5khqyr2grf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>As mentioned above, there are two groups I hope to reach and enrich with this campaign.  The backers are vital and without them the project will not go forward.  Even if just the funding target is reached, 200 calendars will be printed and provided to the backers as perks.  My hope is that the calendar's wildlife images will nudge their lives (and the lives of others that happen to flip through its pages) toward a deeper connection to the natural world.</p>
<p>If backers embrace the concept and provide funding over and above the minimum target level, then marvelous additional benefits will be possible.  I will be able to print more calendars and provide those to teachers, students, and libraries around Texas.  If only a few young people are inspired to connect with their natural environment and then help protect it through their actions, my efforts will be rewarded.</p>
<p><u>Note on Budget:</u></p>
<p>The 10% platform (and other) fees are the fees charged by Indiegogo and by credit card companies and PayPal.</p>
<p>The printing company advises me that the cost of printing varies (slightly) as the cost of paper, ink, and other commodities change.  I've added a 5% factor to anticipate such changes.</p>
<p>The management fee of $1.13 per calendar is my calculation of the combined costs of organizing and implementing the project.  These costs include transportation, utilities, and communications (phone, Internet, etc.).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>I do believe the proposed project is without high risk.  Sometimes unforeseen problems arise and those have to be solved.  I am a retired university physics and astronomy professor and a past director of a Texas A&amp;M University Center.  I am used to facing and solving problems.  I have been successful at problem solving over the years and will bring my experience to bear if challenges do slow the progress toward my goal.</p>
<p><strong>Other ways you can help</strong></p>
<p>Please do alert your friends and relatives about this opportunity and ask them to become backers here at Indiegogo.  Help me get the word out through social media too.  Please consider increasing your support level (beyond just one calendar) and pick a perk that offers five or 10 calendars.  These will make great gifts during the holiday season.</p>
<p><strong>Images that will be used in the calendar</strong></p>

</div></div>","Summary
I have spent much of my retirement traveling around south Texas photographing denizens of the ""Brush Country"", as we Texans call it.  This diverse region makes a home for hundreds of plants and animals, many that can be found nowhere else north of Mexico.
My hope is to share these images with others (especially children) so that they might be inspired to greater appreciation of the wild treasures all around us.
The first toe-in-the-water is the creation of a 2018 Wildlife Calendar using 13 of my recent nature photographs.  I have kept this campaign modest in both its goals and in its required funding.
Please read on to get a full understanding of what we can achieve together.
Present Status of the Project
The hard work of the project is complete.  The photography is done and the post processing of the images is finished.  A printing company has been selected and all the images have been resized to match the printer's guidelines. The complete calendar layout has been uploaded to the printing company and proofed and is ready for me to fill in the number of calendars that I need and click on the ""Purchase"" button.  Below, is a screen capture image of what the January Page will look like (of course the actual calendar will have much higher resolution).

I have included images that will appear on the cover (and for all the month-pages) at the end of this section.
Goals and Objectives
Goal:  My goal is to use my nature photography to gently nudge others toward a closer relationship with the wild animals and plants all around us.
Objective (1 - completed):  To select 13 images from my recent field work that present animals and plants in an up close and personal way.
Objective (2 - completed):  To select a high-quality printing company that specializes in calendars and prepare a prototype version of a 28-page 2018 calendar using the 13 wildlife images.
Objective (3 - completed):  To create a compelling Indiegogo campaign to raise the funds to have the calendar printed.  Of course whether the campaign is ""compelling"" will be measured by the level of funding provided by my backers.
Objective (4):  After the minimum funding level has been reached, to get the calendars in the hands of, and before the eyes of, my backers.
Objective (5):  To raise funding as far as possible above the minimum necessary to fulfill my obligation to the backers.  This extra funding will allow me to provide the calendars ""free of charge"" to many schools and libraries in my state.  Young people are the future and they are the individuals I most want to engage with my photography.
If these five objectives are completed successfully, much progress toward satisfying my goal will be assured.
What I Need & What You Get

I have calculated the cost of this project and established a break even point ($1600).  The break even point will be the fixed funding level target for this campaign.

As mentioned above, there are two groups I hope to reach and enrich with this campaign.  The backers are vital and without them the project will not go forward.  Even if just the funding target is reached, 200 calendars will be printed and provided to the backers as perks.  My hope is that the calendar's wildlife images will nudge their lives (and the lives of others that happen to flip through its pages) toward a deeper connection to the natural world.
If backers embrace the concept and provide funding over and above the minimum target level, then marvelous additional benefits will be possible.  I will be able to print more calendars and provide those to teachers, students, and libraries around Texas.  If only a few young people are inspired to connect with their natural environment and then help protect it through their actions, my efforts will be rewarded.
Note on Budget:
The 10% platform (and other) fees are the fees charged by Indiegogo and by credit card companies and PayPal.
The printing company advises me that the cost of printing varies (slightly) as the cost of paper, ink, and other commodities change.  I've added a 5% factor to anticipate such changes.
The management fee of $1.13 per calendar is my calculation of the combined costs of organizing and implementing the project.  These costs include transportation, utilities, and communications (phone, Internet, etc.).
 
Risks & Challenges

I do believe the proposed project is without high risk.  Sometimes unforeseen problems arise and those have to be solved.  I am a retired university physics and astronomy professor and a past director of a Texas A&M University Center.  I am used to facing and solving problems.  I have been successful at problem solving over the years and will bring my experience to bear if challenges do slow the progress toward my goal.
Other ways you can help
Please do alert your friends and relatives about this opportunity and ask them to become backers here at Indiegogo.  Help me get the word out through social media too.  Please consider increasing your support level (beyond just one calendar) and pick a perk that offers five or 10 calendars.  These will make great gifts during the holiday season.

<p>Due anni fa, un po’ per gioco, abbiamo deciso di aprire un
profilo Instagram che raccontasse la città di <b>Milano</b> in tutte le sue
sfaccettature. Creammo quindi <a href=""http://instagram.com/milandreamin"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">@milandreamin</a>, che a distanza di due anni
raccoglie più di 3000 follower provenienti da tutto il mondo e ci ha permesso
di conoscere centinaia di persone e di realtà.</p>
<p>Quotidianamente, girando per la città, carichiamo foto in
alta qualità per condividere <b>il nostro amore per Milano</b> con gli altri utenti.</p>
<p>Certo, sarebbe più facile prendere foto altrui e caricarle
sul nostro profilo, ma da sempre ci siamo impegnati a caricare solo ed
esclusivamente foto scattate da noi.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451852942/ofmv3qtznb81lgxiusfh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<h3><b>Perché fare un libro,
allora?</b></h3>
<p>@milandreamin è diventato quello che è solo grazie
all’interesse e alla partecipazione dei nostri follower. </p>
<p>Grazie a questo <b>gruppo
speciale di persone</b> che ogni giorno ci seguono, commentano e condividono con
noi un po’ della loro giornata, abbiamo pensato che questa passione non dovesse
rimanere solo immateriale ma bensì tangibile e concreta attraverso le pagine di
un libro. </p>
<h3><b>Quindi ... è un libro
di foto?</b></h3>
<p><b>Si! Ma non solo.</b> Quando ci vengono mostrate foto emozionanti
della nostra città, o della città di cui ci siamo innamorati e abbiamo sempre
sognato di visitare, si crea in noi qualcosa che va oltre l’osservare
passivamente una fotografia e vengono mossi dei sentimenti che non ci saremmo
aspettati di provare.</p>

fondi?</b></p>
<b>
La possibilità di creare è nel nostro DNA.</b> Ma in questi casi la sola passione non è sufficiente. Presentare le foto
nel modo migliore possibile, attraverso la stampa di un
libro, è costoso. Ma ciò non ci impedisce di credere fermamente in questo
progetto. 

<p>Nel libro vogliamo inserire non solo le <b>foto più belle</b> già
caricate sul profilo di Instagram, ma anche e soprattutto nuove foto esclusive
e particolari di Milano, per le quali è necessaria un’attrezzatura fotografica
adeguata, che speriamo di poter acquistare grazie al vostro contributo.</p>

<h3><b>Perché questo
progetto è così importante?</b></h3>
<p>Siamo venuti a Indiegogo perché la comunità qui è
fenomenale. Non è sempre facile chiedere il sostegno finanziario per un progetto,
ma pensare al denaro come un'altra risorsa per valorizzare la creatività, in un
certo modo, è il più grande obiettivo che speriamo di realizzare.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Abbiamo
scelto la modalità di <b>finanziamento fisso</b>: tutto o niente. Ciò vuol dire che
qualora non dovessimo raggiungere il nostro obiettivo, fissato a <b>8000 <b>€</b></b>, le
somme che avrete donato vi torneranno indietro e il progetto non verrà
completato.</p>
<p>Una frase di un comico inglese ci ha ispirato:</p>
<p>""<i>Ho imparato che il denaro può essere un sacco di cose.
Può essere qualcosa che viene accumulato, conteso, protetto, rubato e
trattenuto. Oppure può essere come un'energia, alimentata dal desiderio, dall'interesse
creativo, dal bisogno di ridere di grandi gruppi di persone. E può essere condiviso
e donato per alimentare un interesse comune</i>"".</p>
<p>Questo è uno dei primi grandi progetti a cui abbiamo mai
lavorato e non vediamo l'ora di raggiungere il traguardo.</p>
<p>Se hai letto fino a questo punto, grazie per la lettura.</p>
<p>

<p><span>Two years ago, just for fun, we
decided to open an Instragram account to describe the city of <b>Milan</b> in all its
facets. Therefore, we created </span><a href=""http://instagram.com/milandreamin"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"" target=""_blank"">@milandreamin</a><span>, which, 2 years later, collects
more than 3000 followers from all around the world and it allows us to meet
hundreds of people and realities.</span><br/></p>
<p>Daily, walking in the city, we
upload high quality photographs to share <b>our love for Milan</b> with other people.</p>
<p>Surely, it would be easier to take
pictures of others and upload them to our account, but we have always dedicated
ourselves to use only our own photos.</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451852942/ofmv3qtznb81lgxiusfh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<h3><b><br/></b></h3><h3><b>Why make a book then?</b></h3>
<p><a href=""http://instagram.com/milandreamin"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">@milandreamin</a> has become what it
really is only through the interest and the participation of our followers.</p>
<p>Thanks to this <b>special group of
people</b> who follow us every day, comment and share a little of their life with
us, we’ve decided that this passion must not remain only immaterial, but rather
tangible and concrete through the pages of a book.</p>
<h3><b>So… is it a book of photos?</b></h3>
<p><b>YES! But not only that. </b>When we are shown
exciting pictures of our city, or the city that we love and we dream to visit,
it creates in us something beyond the passive observation of a photo and
feelings that we would not expected to try are moved.</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451851973/pxrowe5hscuruocbxdf1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<h3><b>Why raise money?</b></h3>
<p><b>The ability to create is in our DNA.</b>
However, in these cases, the mere passion is not enough. Presenting the photos
in the best way possible, through the press of a high quality book, is
expensive. Nevertheless, it does not stop us from firmly believing in this
project. </p>
<p>We want to put in the book not only
the <b>most beautiful photos</b> already uploaded to the Instagram account, but also
new exclusive and particular ones, for which an adequate camera equipment is
necessary, and we hope to buy it thanks to your contribution.</p>

</div></div>","• English version below •Versione italiana
Due anni fa, un po’ per gioco, abbiamo deciso di aprire un
profilo Instagram che raccontasse la città di Milano in tutte le sue
sfaccettature. Creammo quindi @milandreamin, che a distanza di due anni
raccoglie più di 3000 follower provenienti da tutto il mondo e ci ha permesso
di conoscere centinaia di persone e di realtà.
Quotidianamente, girando per la città, carichiamo foto in
alta qualità per condividere il nostro amore per Milano con gli altri utenti.
Certo, sarebbe più facile prendere foto altrui e caricarle
sul nostro profilo, ma da sempre ci siamo impegnati a caricare solo ed
esclusivamente foto scattate da noi.


Perché fare un libro,
allora?
@milandreamin è diventato quello che è solo grazie
all’interesse e alla partecipazione dei nostri follower. 
Grazie a questo gruppo
speciale di persone che ogni giorno ci seguono, commentano e condividono con
noi un po’ della loro giornata, abbiamo pensato che questa passione non dovesse
rimanere solo immateriale ma bensì tangibile e concreta attraverso le pagine di
un libro. 
Quindi ... è un libro
di foto?
Si! Ma non solo. Quando ci vengono mostrate foto emozionanti
della nostra città, o della città di cui ci siamo innamorati e abbiamo sempre
sognato di visitare, si crea in noi qualcosa che va oltre l’osservare
passivamente una fotografia e vengono mossi dei sentimenti che non ci saremmo
aspettati di provare.


Ma allora perché raccogliere
fondi?

La possibilità di creare è nel nostro DNA. Ma in questi casi la sola passione non è sufficiente. Presentare le foto
nel modo migliore possibile, attraverso la stampa di un
libro, è costoso. Ma ciò non ci impedisce di credere fermamente in questo
progetto. 

Nel libro vogliamo inserire non solo le foto più belle già
caricate sul profilo di Instagram, ma anche e soprattutto nuove foto esclusive
e particolari di Milano, per le quali è necessaria un’attrezzatura fotografica
adeguata, che speriamo di poter acquistare grazie al vostro contributo.

Quali sono i perks? 
I perks sono delle ricompense per la
vostra generosità ed essi variano in base alla somma di denaro donata.
Sappiamo che una campagna Indiegogo
non sarebbe completa senza perks.
Ecco qualche informazione in più su
alcuni dei perks che abbiamo pensato per voi:
Grazie mille
Ringraziamento pubblico sul libro
insieme a tutti gli altri donatori.

LINK AL PERK - 5 EUR

Cartolina con la copertina del libro
Stampata su carta di qualità, la cartolina ritrarrà
la copertina del libro che sarà pubblicato.
Con il suo formato 10 x 15cm è perfetta da
inviare ad un vecchio amico, scrivere un biglietto d’amore, o semplicemente
attaccarla alla parete.


LINK AL PERK - 10 EUR
Una tua foto sul nostro fotolibro!

La community per noi è davvero importante: su Instagram abbiamo centinaia di persone che giornalmente ci seguono e vorremmo dar loro spazio di esprimersi con le loro foto magnifiche.
Creeremo una sezione nel fotolibro contenente il collage di tutte le foto ricevute, scrivendo sotto ogni immagine il nickname di Instagram.

Attenzione però perchè queste foto dovranno avere delle limitazioni*:


devono riguardare la città di Milano (es. luoghi d'interesse, per intenderci non vogliamo foto di gattini pelosi o dei vostri selfie in piazza Duomo)

devono essere di ottima qualità (almeno 1400x1400px) e in formato quadrato, proprio come le avete postate!
qualora ritraessero persone bisognerà inviare via e-mail anche la liberatoria


La quota di 15 euro ci aiuterà a raggiungere il nostro obiettivo e di conseguenza a pubblicare il fotolibro.
Dopo aver aderito al perk, scegliete la foto da inviarci, verrete contattati nel più breve tempo possibile!
*qualora le foto inviateci non rispetteranno una delle 3 limitazioni, ci riserviamo la possibilità di richiederne un'altra

Perché questo
progetto è così importante?
Siamo venuti a Indiegogo perché la comunità qui è
fenomenale. Non è sempre facile chiedere il sostegno finanziario per un progetto,
ma pensare al denaro come un'altra risorsa per valorizzare la creatività, in un
certo modo, è il più grande obiettivo che speriamo di realizzare.


Abbiamo
scelto la modalità di finanziamento fisso: tutto o niente. Ciò vuol dire che
qualora non dovessimo raggiungere il nostro obiettivo, fissato a 8000 €, le
somme che avrete donato vi torneranno indietro e il progetto non verrà
completato.
Una frase di un comico inglese ci ha ispirato:
""Ho imparato che il denaro può essere un sacco di cose.
Può essere qualcosa che viene accumulato, conteso, protetto, rubato e
trattenuto. Oppure può essere come un'energia, alimentata dal desiderio, dall'interesse
creativo, dal bisogno di ridere di grandi gruppi di persone. E può essere condiviso
e donato per alimentare un interesse comune"".
Questo è uno dei primi grandi progetti a cui abbiamo mai
lavorato e non vediamo l'ora di raggiungere il traguardo.
Se hai letto fino a questo punto, grazie per la lettura.

Se non puoi contribuire donando, continua a seguirci su Facebook, Twitter e su thatsmilano.altervista.org condividendo la nostra
campagna di crowdfunding con la tua cerchia di amici. In questo modo
la nostra campagna potrà raggiungere un maggior numero di persone. 
Significa davvero molto per noi
Grazie
ancora.
Matteo e
Camilla





English version
Two years ago, just for fun, we
decided to open an Instragram account to describe the city of Milan in all its
facets. Therefore, we created @milandreamin, which, 2 years later, collects
more than 3000 followers from all around the world and it allows us to meet
hundreds of people and realities.
Daily, walking in the city, we
upload high quality photographs to share our love for Milan with other people.
Surely, it would be easier to take
pictures of others and upload them to our account, but we have always dedicated
ourselves to use only our own photos.

Why make a book then?
@milandreamin has become what it
really is only through the interest and the participation of our followers.
Thanks to this special group of
people who follow us every day, comment and share a little of their life with
us, we’ve decided that this passion must not remain only immaterial, but rather
tangible and concrete through the pages of a book.
So… is it a book of photos?
YES! But not only that. When we are shown
exciting pictures of our city, or the city that we love and we dream to visit,
it creates in us something beyond the passive observation of a photo and
feelings that we would not expected to try are moved.

Why raise money?
The ability to create is in our DNA.
However, in these cases, the mere passion is not enough. Presenting the photos
in the best way possible, through the press of a high quality book, is
expensive. Nevertheless, it does not stop us from firmly believing in this
project. 
We want to put in the book not only
the most beautiful photos already uploaded to the Instagram account, but also
new exclusive and particular ones, for which an adequate camera equipment is
necessary, and we hope to buy it thanks to your contribution.

What about perks?
Perks are rewards for your
generosity and they change according to the sum of money donated.
We know that an Indiegogo campaign
wouldn’t be complete without perks.
Here there are some more information
of some of the perks we have thought about for you:

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hi my name is Julie Shoults and I am an explorer. I've been all around the world in search of untouched ecosystems and adventure.  </li>
<li>This campaign is important to me for many reasons. The project will allow me to push myself as a photographer, freediver, and slackliner. More importantly I will be able to share inner peace that these sports have granted me. This year I was diagnosed with PTSD. These sports truly help my mind relax and this project will help me heal. </li>
<li>Contributors will help me achieve unique images that reflect something many people in today's society are missing: Peace of Mind. </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What We Need </strong></h3>
</div><div><ul>
<li>I need 7,000 dollars to capture all the images I have in mind. This will go towards gear. I need an underwater housing for a DSLR camera, underwater strobes, a monofin, and new equipment to set up a slackline at elevation.</li>
<li>If I don't reach my entire goal I will still be able to purchase some equipment and create some amazing images!</li>
</ul></div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>In an era of ocean acidification, climate change, overfishing, pollution, etc., it is uncertain how long marine life will be able to survive. Coral reefs are particularly vulnerable. It is important to preserve these ecosystems in photos before they disappear completely.</li>
<li>This photo series will focus on Peace of Mind. I want to create these images to help others with PTSD. </li>
<li>I have been focusing on wildlife photography, so this project will literally help me dive out of my comfort zone. Here is a link to my photography portfolio: <a href=""http://www.julieshoults.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.julieshoults.com</a> </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Project:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>This photography series is an exploration into peace of mind. It will focus on two extreme adventure sports.</p></li>
<li><p>The first is freediving. This is when divers plunge into the ocean without SCUBA gear. Participants train to increase their depth and breath hold time. Although freediving may seem like an exhilarating rush for adrenaline junkies, it is actually quite peaceful. Beneath the surface, without loud breathing equipment, with one breath, I find peace. I want to share this peace with others through photography. I am a PADI SCUBA Instructor and avid amateur freediver. I will be relocating to Siargao, a remote island in the Philippines, to hone my craft and become an AIDA Freediving Instructor. </p></li>
<li><p>The other sport is slacklining. It is a sport invented by climbers. A thin piece of webbing unites two trees and slackliners walk upon the line. It requires great focus, balance, and concentration. I was fortunate enough to learn slackline skills in the circus. Siargao seems like the perfect setting to create awesome slackline set ups and photos. </p></li>
<li><p>Both sports may seem different, but they exercise the same core muscle: the mind. Focus is necessary to stay atop a thin line and to sink into the ocean's depths. Participants must only exist in the present moment or they will fail at their sport. This peaceful presence is what I aim to capture. </p></li>
<li><p>My photos will focus on simplicity. I want my audience to feel like they are underwater or in the air with me. Composing shots in the deep blue of the Pacific will help me capture the mystery of the oceans. Slacklining will also give me a chance to compost unique, elegant shots. I will recruit a drone pilot and an underwater photographer to capture these sports. We will work as a team. we will discuss the composition, lighting, and mood of the shots, so they work together in one cohesive series. I want to unite land and sea, ocean and air in one compelling series of portraits and landscapes. <br/> </p></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

More importantly I will be able to share inner peace that these sports have granted me. This year I was diagnosed with PTSD. These sports truly help my mind relax and this project will help me heal. 
Contributors will help me achieve unique images that reflect something many people in today's society are missing: Peace of Mind. 

What We Need 

I need 7,000 dollars to capture all the images I have in mind. This will go towards gear. I need an underwater housing for a DSLR camera, underwater strobes, a monofin, and new equipment to set up a slackline at elevation.
If I don't reach my entire goal I will still be able to purchase some equipment and create some amazing images!

The Impact

In an era of ocean acidification, climate change, overfishing, pollution, etc., it is uncertain how long marine life will be able to survive. Coral reefs are particularly vulnerable. It is important to preserve these ecosystems in photos before they disappear completely.
This photo series will focus on Peace of Mind. I want to create these images to help others with PTSD. 
I have been focusing on wildlife photography, so this project will literally help me dive out of my comfort zone. Here is a link to my photography portfolio: www.julieshoults.com 


The Project:

This photography series is an exploration into peace of mind. It will focus on two extreme adventure sports.
The first is freediving. This is when divers plunge into the ocean without SCUBA gear. Participants train to increase their depth and breath hold time. Although freediving may seem like an exhilarating rush for adrenaline junkies, it is actually quite peaceful. Beneath the surface, without loud breathing equipment, with one breath, I find peace. I want to share this peace with others through photography. I am a PADI SCUBA Instructor and avid amateur freediver. I will be relocating to Siargao, a remote island in the Philippines, to hone my craft and become an AIDA Freediving Instructor. 
The other sport is slacklining. It is a sport invented by climbers. A thin piece of webbing unites two trees and slackliners walk upon the line. It requires great focus, balance, and concentration. I was fortunate enough to learn slackline skills in the circus. Siargao seems like the perfect setting to create awesome slackline set ups and photos. 
Both sports may seem different, but they exercise the same core muscle: the mind. Focus is necessary to stay atop a thin line and to sink into the ocean's depths. Participants must only exist in the present moment or they will fail at their sport. This peaceful presence is what I aim to capture. 
My photos will focus on simplicity. I want my audience to feel like they are underwater or in the air with me. Composing shots in the deep blue of the Pacific will help me capture the mystery of the oceans. Slacklining will also give me a chance to compost unique, elegant shots. I will recruit a drone pilot and an underwater photographer to capture these sports. We will work as a team. we will discuss the composition, lighting, and mood of the shots, so they work together in one cohesive series. I want to unite land and sea, ocean and air in one compelling series of portraits and landscapes.

<h2>A Little about Ankit</h2>
<p>Namaste! family from the world, I am <strong>a photographer</strong> who shares a<strong> love for creating images</strong> that tell <strong>stories</strong> of <strong>nature</strong>,<strong> mountains, and people from different cultures</strong>.  I was born and raised in a small city called Bhiwani, Haryana in Northen India. Trained as an engineer by education I decided to take an unconventional path by choosing to<strong> travel and volunteer as a photographer for humanitarian organizations. </strong></p>
<p>From Past two years, I had been <strong>volunteering</strong> in Nepal with non-profit organizations like <a href=""https://www.consciousimpact.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Conscious impact</a> and <a href=""https://www.allhandsandhearts.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">All hands and hearts</a> which are working on projects that are working towards <strong>Sustainability, Education</strong>, <strong>Agriculture</strong> and <strong>Rebuilding</strong> <strong>schools,</strong> <strong>homes</strong>, <strong>toilets</strong> and <strong>community awareness </strong>after the <strong>earthquake.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>What is this project about?</strong></h2>
<p>The motive of this project is to <strong>preserve</strong> the ancient<strong> culture </strong>of the <strong>Himalayas</strong> ,connect with its <strong>people</strong> , <strong>learn</strong> about their <strong>life</strong>, <strong>community </strong>, <strong>issues </strong>that are arising due to changing times, climate and conditions , As a photographer i feel a need to <strong>preserve cultures which are on a verge of extinction on this ancient land</strong> and share those stories with people around the world .</p>
<p>With your contribution, I will be able to create a<strong> unique photographic documentation of Himalayas after the earthquake which is one of its kind of record for art, history, and beauty </strong>which will continue to create a sense of beauty and awareness for not only this generation but generations to come. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536744057/fx4ydvbp5rjirfqgaps0.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What motivates me to do this?</h2>
<p><strong>I want to live a life that allows me to be kind to people and do work that </strong><strong>adds</strong><strong> value to peoples lives.</strong></p>
<p>With that intent, I wish to create photos that are able to <strong>evoke emotions</strong>, that have an essence of the<strong> human element</strong> and have the ability to<strong> move people</strong>. Stories that show our beauty as a culture, beauty that lies in natural formations, something that<strong> reminds us and make us understand.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I am a person with curiosity who wants to know about other people and their land and share that knowledge in form of images. It's a beautiful feeling when you are invited by people with their kind and welcoming spirit, whom you have never met before to their homes where they share their life and way of doing things. </strong></p>
<p>Spending past two years in Nepal working with nonprofits allowed me to live in rural villages and learn the nepali language. This lead to a better understanding of the mindset and culture of nepal as I was able to make stronger connections. Working in development i also got to learn about sustainability and needs of a community . <strong>The joy that </strong><strong>i</strong><strong> experienced on the handover of completed school projects and home is worth all the hard work done so far by our teams. With all this, I</strong><strong> wish to move in a direction to pursue the creation of artful images and sustainable work.</strong></p>

Meet Paul, abject poverty describes his life. Here is his story. He was born in the rural part of Kenya, his parents died as a result of the HIV/ AIDS scourge that was sweeping the village mercilessly sparing no one on its path. 
Their home is made of mud walls and grass thatch on the roof. It stands on a government land because the family sold all their assets so as to provide medical care for the parents. Here he lives with his smaller sister and his grandmother. His grandmother cooks using firewood in the small house and as a result coughs loud and hard. It is hard.His sister is highly malnourished because they can barely have three 
balanced meals and instead rely more on maize porridge and maize meals 
in order to survive from day to day.Paul thought of trying to help his grandmother in finding money for the family to use and help stop the sister's nutritional problem. He migrated to the big city Nairobi to look for income. He unfortunately had a brush with the law enforcers because he ended up being a scavenger for items to sell to the industries. Those he called friends fooled him and he ended up stealing things to sell.
Desperation pushed him hard and he ended up in a juvenile detention center
With good behavior, Paul was released from the center and he took to sports, boxing to keep himself busy by training young children in self defense mechanisms and life skills.
As we speak Paul's sister is in dire need of good nutrition and currently admitted at a nutrition center in the community with the home that the situation will be reversed before she clocks 2 years. The granny still coughs and she cannot afford medicine.Paul wants an opportunity to tell his story to the world through the camera. Many more share a similar story.
 What We Need & What You Get 

We are seeking to raise $74,722 which will go towards purchase of 50 cameras, 50 computers and procure professionally trained photographers and bloggers to help us tell a similar story of 50 more youths. when they learn photography, Paul and others will start earning from their acquired skills and therefore he will be able to afford medicine for grandma, proper meals for the sister and improved housing structure for grandma.















We do want to tell our story, it is a stepping stone towards creating awareness on the plight of juvenile children and the challenges they go through to survive.








The Impact The anticipated impact out of this project is that:
1. 50 learners will be able to better and positively express 
themselves, through basic skills in blogging and photography, on issues 
affecting their lives and recommend solutions to these problems.
2. 50 learners are able to focus and engage in positive activities.

20 project consents signed.
3. 
All project equipment purchased.
4. 
Development of a project curriculum and a master
calendar (To aid in effective planning of the workshops.)
5. 
All scheduled workshops completed. All students
attended most classes and actively participated in both theoretical and
practical lessons on blogging and photography.
6. 
Learners email accounts, blog accounts and
accounts for online photo were shared created.
7. 
Learners able to blog and use a computer and
camera at a basic level. The blogging was done internally and is yet to be
posted online.








Risks & Challenges
1. 
Availability
of only three cameras has posed a challenge as the learners had to share them among
themselves,
2. 
The
learners have only been able to develop very basic photography and computer
skills as the children did not handle the cameras and computers on a daily
basis,
3. 
Slow
and unreliable Internet connection at Internet cafés slowed the process and
frustrated the students,
4. 
Limited
funds resulted in overstretching the funds to meet all necessary requirements
of the project,
5. 
Limited
or no resources to hold a local exhibition and,
6. 
Limited
or no time or resources to hold the TOT (Training of Trainers) in this phase

Having had prior experience in digital photography we are better placed 
to implement a second phase of the project with a higher degree of 
success. The challenges faced previously will now be mitigated through 
proper planning and project implementation with a monitoring and 
evaluation component.








Other Ways You Can Help
With your help, we can fulfill the wishes of children like my daughter, who
is just from rehabilitation for reasons influenced by me as a parent and my bad
choices in life. Let us tell their story to help improve our parenting
skills.

Please share widely with others if you have a daughter with similar challenges and use the Indiegogo share tools.














Please contact me directly. I'm happy to tell you more!

<h3>About the author </h3>
<p>My name is Bakang Baloi. I am a Botswana-trained molecular biologist and self-taught cultural and nature photographer currently based in Brisbane Australia. My photography is mainly about different aspects of life in Botswana. I also do wildlife photography and commissioned conceptual and abstract work. My photography is in private collections worldwide and has been exhibited in group and solo exhibitions in Botswana. I was the 2016 winner of the Thapong Artist of the Year (Photography Section). I have worked as a professional safari guide, environmental consultant, and cultural advisor to the movie industry and a researcher in vaccine development. Since 2007 I have photographed performances of San trance healing festivals and collected thousands of images in the process. The photographs have been collected into a large format coffee table book. </p>
<h2><strong>About the book</strong></h2>
<p>The glossy hard covered book was printed in Singapore by Tien Wah Press Pte, is 308 pages thick and contains over 200 images. It is a visual celebration of the soul of cultural identity of the San that aims to honour our diverse cultural heritage by showcasing evocative images of traditional dance events in their most authentic settings. The book promotes San culture by creating awareness of the rich cultural offering of the San people to a local and international audience. The book is divided into six chapters, arranged to tell the story of the role traditionally played by art, music and dance in the life of San people. This includes influence of dance on such areas as Hunting, Gathering and Trance healing among others. The photography captures the essence of a legacy of one of the world’s oldest surviving cultures.</p>
<p><strong><i>Faces of Botswana</i></strong> brings due recognition to custodians of this culture, and provides a platform to reward the performers for their commitment to the message of cultural identity. The book weaves San cultural identity into the tapestry of Botswana’s national and international brand. It allows one to peel the layers of a rich cultural history and look longingly into a long bygone era. </p>
<p>The book was generously funded by CIPA (Botswana's Copyright and Intellectual Property Authority) and produced in collaboration with Letloa Development Trust; a Not-for-Profit Organisation based in the township of Ghanzi. <strong><i>Faces of Botswana</i></strong> aims to benefit San communities by contributing royalties from the sale of the book to the Trust to help tackle the different challenges faced by San communities.</p>

<h3>What the money will be used for</h3>
<p>The costs of design and layout, printing and binding, and purchasing of the ISBN have already been borne. This means that the book is printed and bound and ready for shipping. The monies raised will be for order fulfilment. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Brittney Horth. I'm currently a student at Full Sail University. I've made several short films and have been working on various photography projects for about a decade.  I've struggled with suicidal ideation and major depression for as long as I can remember. Photography was my first method of coping and I've been working on a very specific personal project for years, Collecting self portraits and pictures I've taken in the pits of my depression. I hope to finish the project this summer with a final shoot depicting the hope that is always present under the depression. Along, with the taboo way society views people with mental illness. It would be a huge goal reached to finally showcase this project outside of my own viewings and if fully funded turn this into a photography book. </p>
<p><strong>I'm asking for:</strong> $3500. </p>

<p>$1500:  to upgrade my equipment, including new editing systems I need to finish up the pictures I have already taken. Along with new lens', stands, more lighting and filters to complete the final portion of my project.</p>
<p>$1000:  for costume materials and makeup including detailed practical makeup (latex, molds, plus basic beauty makeup.</p>

Το έργο αυτό, που βρίσκεται σε εξέλιξη εδώ και δυο χρόνια, έχει ως στόχο να δημιουργήσει μια φωτογραφική συλλογή των σπάνια καταγεγραμμένων στο φακό τοπίων των ελληνικών νησιών καθώς και της κληρονομιάς τους.

Out of approximately 270 inhabited islands and up to 6,000 islands in total, I selected approximately 80 islands representing all of the main inhabited islands. My goal is to portray the natural landmarks as well as the cultural and historical heritage of these places and bring them to a broader audience.

This will culminate in the publication of a coffee table book covering all the main inhabited islands of Greece.

This collection celebrates the beauty of the natural female form, with an emphasis on pubic hair. With your contribution I would be able to focus on finishing the book and getting it in your hands!

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""> <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>My name is Gonzalo Manera and I’m an action and lifestyle photographer based in Madrid. I have been snowboarding for over 22 years (more than half my life!) and I love it deeply. It has given me so much that I wanted to give back to the sport. In 2013 I created The Eight with that idea in mind.</p><p>On one side I wanted to offer the photographers a completely free outlet to show their photography to the world. On the other side I also wanted to have every snowboarder enjoy the best photography in the world. My main goal with the project is to inspire people to go out to the mountains and get more creative there and hopefully throughout their lives as well.</p>
<p></p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7315/15967114234_b2e8ea4827_c.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p></p>
<div> <h3>The book</h3>
<p>Each book features eight photographers (thus the name!) and each has a number of pages to show their work as they envisioned it, without any editorial or creative constrains. This is the real value of the book, photographers showing their vision to the world on their own way, through their own eye.</p>
<p>The books are printed on the best quality paper for photography and we keep the price low so everyone can afford it. The book quality is amazing and we want it to be on people’s book collections for years to come. Be a part of snowboarding history.</p>
<p>If someone still can’t afford to purchase the books they always have the free digital version so nobody is left out. The goal is to have every snowboarder enjoy amazing photography, right?</p>
<p>These are all the book details:</p>
<li>132 pages</li>
<li>Offset-printed and perfect bound</li>
<li>Full color on uncoated paper</li>
<li>Printed in Europe</li>
<li>Cover. Rives Design Bright White 250gr.</li>
<li>Interior. Olin Absolute White 160gr.</li>
<li>Size. 185mm x 245mm / 7.28in x 9.65in</li>
<p></p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7390/16588640112_7acf97542c_c.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p></p>
<div> <h3>Photographers &amp; Colors</h3>
<p>Each The Eight book has a color instead of a number. We think photography is timeless, so no book is supposed to go before or after the other, they all stand on the same level. Without numbering we achieve this and give a little spin to the design on every book.</p>
<p>All the images you see here for the new book are mockups. We still haven’t decided the color this book will be. The decision is based on the cover photo and we still have a couple of photographers who have not submitted their photos. The photographers who will be featured on this book are:</p>
<li>Dice-K Maruyama</li>
<li>E-Stone</li>
<li>Embry Rucker</li>
<li>Lorenz Holder</li>
<li>Marc Gasch</li>
<li>Oli Gagnon</li>
<li>Tero Repo</li>
<li>Vanessa Andrieux</li>
<p></p>
<p>We are really looking forward to seeing this book printed! It's going to be epic!</p>
</div>
<p></p>

</div>
<p></p>
<div> <h3>The Black Volume</h3>
<p>On November 2013 we released the Black Volume, our first book. We printed 1,500 copies of it. Since the book has no sponsors or ads we had to finance the whole thing out of our own pockets and it was a huge investment. The idea was to finance the new book with the sales of the previous one, but as happy as we are with the how things have gone we haven't sold nearly as many as we would have needed. If you want to check it out you can download the Black Volume <a href=""http://theeightproject.com/volume/black-volume/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. The photographers who were featured on the Black Volume are:</p>
<li>Dean Blotto Gray</li>
<li>Neil Hartmann</li>
<li>Carlos Blanchard</li>
<li>Cyril Müller</li>
<li>Daniel Blom</li>
<li>Jérôme Tanon</li>
<li>Matt Georges</li>
<li>Thomas Stöckli</li>
<p></p>
<p>The work on this book is amazing and each photographer gave a very personal and different look on snowboarding. We still have many copies of the Black Volume and we are offering a few perks with this volume in them. These two photos below are real photos, not mockups.</p>
</div>
<p></p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7407/15968312124_3c10e7cd54_c.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>

<p></p>
<h3>Funding &amp; timeline</h3>
<p>The funding we need is 12,000€. Most of it is for printing expenses and shipping. the rest is for design and layout of the book, web development, etc. The numbers might shift a little bit depending on the shipping costs to different countries but this is more or less how we are spending the money:</p>
<li>8,000€ are for printing expenses. Good paper is expensive!</li>
<li>1,500€ are for design, layout and web development</li>
<li>2,500€ are for shipping</li>
<p></p>
<p>The timeline for this project is easy as we have a lot of things done. Most of the photographers have already submitted their content, so when the campaign gets funded we have to finish putting all the content together and send it to print. The printer takes usually less than a month, so we’ll be ready to ship by early May, 2015. That's just at the end of the season, so with the book you will get enough energy to make it through the summer!</p>

</div>","Introduction
My name is Gonzalo Manera and I’m an action and lifestyle photographer based in Madrid. I have been snowboarding for over 22 years (more than half my life!) and I love it deeply. It has given me so much that I wanted to give back to the sport. In 2013 I created The Eight with that idea in mind.On one side I wanted to offer the photographers a completely free outlet to show their photography to the world. On the other side I also wanted to have every snowboarder enjoy the best photography in the world. My main goal with the project is to inspire people to go out to the mountains and get more creative there and hopefully throughout their lives as well.



 The book
Each book features eight photographers (thus the name!) and each has a number of pages to show their work as they envisioned it, without any editorial or creative constrains. This is the real value of the book, photographers showing their vision to the world on their own way, through their own eye.
The books are printed on the best quality paper for photography and we keep the price low so everyone can afford it. The book quality is amazing and we want it to be on people’s book collections for years to come. Be a part of snowboarding history.
If someone still can’t afford to purchase the books they always have the free digital version so nobody is left out. The goal is to have every snowboarder enjoy amazing photography, right?
These are all the book details:
132 pages
Offset-printed and perfect bound
Full color on uncoated paper
Printed in Europe
Cover. Rives Design Bright White 250gr.
Interior. Olin Absolute White 160gr.
Size. 185mm x 245mm / 7.28in x 9.65in



 Photographers & Colors
Each The Eight book has a color instead of a number. We think photography is timeless, so no book is supposed to go before or after the other, they all stand on the same level. Without numbering we achieve this and give a little spin to the design on every book.
All the images you see here for the new book are mockups. We still haven’t decided the color this book will be. The decision is based on the cover photo and we still have a couple of photographers who have not submitted their photos. The photographers who will be featured on this book are:
Dice-K Maruyama
E-Stone
Embry Rucker
Lorenz Holder
Marc Gasch
Oli Gagnon
Tero Repo
Vanessa Andrieux

We are really looking forward to seeing this book printed! It's going to be epic!





 The Black Volume
On November 2013 we released the Black Volume, our first book. We printed 1,500 copies of it. Since the book has no sponsors or ads we had to finance the whole thing out of our own pockets and it was a huge investment. The idea was to finance the new book with the sales of the previous one, but as happy as we are with the how things have gone we haven't sold nearly as many as we would have needed. If you want to check it out you can download the Black Volume here. The photographers who were featured on the Black Volume are:
Dean Blotto Gray
Neil Hartmann
Carlos Blanchard
Cyril Müller
Daniel Blom
Jérôme Tanon
Matt Georges
Thomas Stöckli

The work on this book is amazing and each photographer gave a very personal and different look on snowboarding. We still have many copies of the Black Volume and we are offering a few perks with this volume in them. These two photos below are real photos, not mockups.






Funding & timeline
The funding we need is 12,000€. Most of it is for printing expenses and shipping. the rest is for design and layout of the book, web development, etc. The numbers might shift a little bit depending on the shipping costs to different countries but this is more or less how we are spending the money:
8,000€ are for printing expenses. Good paper is expensive!
1,500€ are for design, layout and web development
2,500€ are for shipping

The timeline for this project is easy as we have a lot of things done. Most of the photographers have already submitted their content, so when the campaign gets funded we have to finish putting all the content together and send it to print. The printer takes usually less than a month, so we’ll be ready to ship by early May, 2015. That's just at the end of the season, so with the book you will get enough energy to make it through the summer!

<p style=""text-align: center;"">This year, I got to meet some of the refugees living in Paris.

While all of them have their own hardships in their story, it is the tenacity and aspirations of the human spirit which shines through.

Six years have passed since I started taking pictures of my daily life. In this time I have discovered how I could learn about myself through the practice of photography.Photography became a bridge towards my inner life. Rather than separating me from living, it brought me more closer to experiencing life in the present moment.For me, creativity and life are of the same force of nature, and we humans share this creativity quality as well. Something part of who we are.And in my case, when I first recognized this force, it was a moment that profoundly changed my life. Sempo and Sayuri in Argentina, 2013 Un camino hacia mi mismaNorthern India, South Asia and I hope I can continue to Middle EastIntroducciónHan pasado ya seis años desde que empecé a registrar las imágenes de mi cotidiano.Un lapso de tiempo en donde descubrí que podia aprender de mi misma y de mis procesos personales, a través de la práctica de la fotografía.La fotografía empezó a ser mi puente hacia mi misma y pude descubrir que esta práctica  en vez separarme de la vida… empezaba a acercarme más a ella. Cada vez más, siento que gracias a mi conexión con la fotografía, tengo la oportunidad de observar y experimentar mi presente desde distintos ángulos.Para mi, la fotografía puede llegar a ser una práctica meditativa, reflexiva de auto observación y aprendizaje. Por esta razón este proyecto tiene gran importancia para mí.Es mi modo para llegar a compartir con otros mis experiencias y aprendizajes, abordando esta práctica como una herramienta de sanación y autoconocimiento.  Zazen, 2014 The project My idea is to create a photo diary while researching about self-knowledge, ancestral wisdom and ritual art, in different cultures around the world.To make this project, I will be visiting India, Nepal and other countries in Asia and the Middle East. I am interested in the way each culture has developed practices and tools to connect with their own sense of divinity.Practices that unify art with spirituality, such as music, dance and ritual, will be the focus of this photo diary.Creativity as a journey towards ourselves, to our own divinity. From Kalbelia Gypsy Dance from Rajasthan in India to the Dervishes in Turkey,I will use photography as a bridge to bring these practices to you.A diary about been human, about ritual and art. A diary about the many paths that exist and lead to oneself.    Winter, 2015El proyecto Mi idea es crear un diario fotográfico a modo de  investigación personal acerca del arte ritual, el auto-conocimiento y la sabiduría ancestral en diferentes culturas alrededor del mundo. Para realizar éste proyecto voy a emprender un viaje hacia India, Nepal y otros países de Asia y Medio Oriente.Estoy interesada en las prácticas y las herramientas que ha desarrollado cada cultura para conectarse con propio sentido de divinidad.Prácticas que unifique el arte y la espiritualidad, como la música, la danza y el ritual. Es la creatividad como un camino hacia nosotros mismos, un camino hacia nuestra propia divinidad. Desde la Danza gitana Kalbelia en Rajasthan en India hasta los Derviches giradores en Turquía, usaré la fotografía como un puente para traerles estas prácticas a ustedes. Un diario acerca de lo humano, acerca del ritual y arte. Un diario acerca de los tantos caminos que existen que conducen hacia uno mismo. A fire ceremony in Summer, Colombia, 2017 Support From getting a perk to spreading the word, I will be more than grateful in any way you can support this project.

I created CoCreate as a way for freelancers to connect an collaborate with others. I learned quickly that this wouldn't be easy to make feasible.

If you have been wondering to start a business relating products or serving photography this is time to actually just kickstart. I know it`s romantic to say relating this Studio box, but it has never been this much easier with social media, eBay, amazon and now this GENi studio. So leave any excuse behind and see this technique by Gary Vaynerchuk who shows easy earning by flipping garage sale products on eBay: DailyVee Make an extra $100

<h3>Who are We?</h3>
<p><i>Uğur Şenay is a 34-year-old Turkish professional photographer in Istanbul, with an extensive background in both the Theatre and the Music scene and a passion for architectural and fashion photography.</i></p>
<p><i>Cynthia Winterhalter is a 36-year-old Irish amateur photographer and small business owner, with a background in Theatre, Film and Business and a passion for writing and, of course, photography.</i></p>
<p>Our combined skills and experience are what make us a powerhouse and will eventually lead to our mutual success in this dream of ours. We share a love of photography and a yearning to make a steady living through beautiful Art. By doing so, we hope to spread some happiness and encourage other artists to follow their dreams and never give up.</p>
<h3>What's it all about?</h3>
<p>Our campaign is all about creating an opportunity to publish a series of artistic photographs which represent our individual styles, within a Photo Book depicting the interplay of Traditional &amp; Modern aspects of everyday life throughout parts of South East Asia.  Exploring South East Asia and discovering all about the interplay between traditional aspects of daily life in comparison to newer, modern aspects will help manifest a collection of exciting photographs which we later intend to publish in the format of a photo book. The idea is to focus on how our own individual cultures and backgrounds influence our vision of certain scenes. Learning about other cultures along the way will also influence the result of the scenes we depict and how we choose to represent those. The outcome will be two different views and two sets of photographs, seen and interpreted differently through artistic choices and influences, with a focus on architecture, culture and people.</p>
<p>We will spend the next few months planning the trip, and then hopefully head off in January of 2018. A successful trip takes careful planning and organisation. It's a good thing making plans and lists is one of my favourite things to do! :)</p>
<p>The hope is that our collection of photographs from S.E. Asia will allow us to stand out from the crowd and show two unique and interesting perspectives. And that, friends, is what it's all about!</p>
<h3>How your contributions will help:</h3>
<p>Your contributions will help us achieve our mutual dream of combining influences, discovery, cultures and photography to create a beautiful collection of images to share with the world. First of all, we will be able to create a buzz around our travel adventures which, in turn, could lead to some exciting encounters whilst on the road.  The funds raised will help us to acquire some extra photography equipment necessary for such a project, pay for flight tickets and travel visas, secure accommodation (even if it just means buying a tent!), and all the insurances necessary for a safe and happy trip.  The rest of the funding will allow us to collate our best photographs, edit and produce a Photo book, as well as send you some great Perks too. Most importantly, your contributions will help  launch us into a journey full of creativity and future projects.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>For this project, we aim to raise a total of $11'000</p>
<p>$1'500 will allow us to buy extra equipment necessary to perfect our photographs for Traditional &amp; Modern South East Asia Series.</p>
<p>$4'500 will allow us to pay for flight tickets, travel visas, boats, trains and motorcycles if necessary to voyage across Asia, snapping at every turn. As well as pitch a tent or two when we get there, eventually stay in a hostel or two and meet like-minded, travelling artists.</p>
<p>$2'500 will go towards the production of prints of various sizes, other Perks, and the production costs for the Photo book itself.</p>
<p>The remaining $2'500 will go towards Indiegogo expenses, tax expenses and other expenditures, including any emergency needs.</p>
<p>In return for your generous contributions, we are offering several unique perks with a personal touch from us, which we are certain you will enjoy. You also gain a little piece of happiness and satisfaction in the idea that you helped made our dream come true, and for that, friends, we truly thank you!</p>
<h3>Why Us?</h3>
<p>What makes us a special team is the combination of our individual skills and our way of seeing the world from different angles. We come from different walks of life and backgrounds, which gives us a unique artistic view. The results visible in our Artwork will be truly unique and exciting.</p>
<h3>What happens if we don't reach our goal?</h3>
<p>If we do not manage to reach our full goal, we won't give up, we will work on a new campaign and try to find some other plans that could lead us to a successful career together. Perhaps a trip closer to home, jumping on a boat and heading over to discover the Greek Islands. However, we will attempt to set up a small exhibition of our local travel Photographic series from Turkey, so if you happen to be in Istanbul at the time we manage to do so, just drop by and check us out! Your money will be returned to you by Indiegogo as per the terms of the site.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The aim of this campaign is to give two artists an exciting edge in the local Istanbul Art scene. We hope that our photographs from far and wide will set us apart from other photographers and will allow us to reach new heights. Diversity and beauty will help us to grow our business and eventually lead to exhibitions, sales and further projects. It is a tough marketplace out there, as I'm sure you know, and we just wish to open the doors of opportunity a little bit wider. Our success will hopefully lead to a mini revival of the Istanbul art scene and we aim to spread a little love, art and happiness. It would mean the world to us if you could be a part of this amazing journey. </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone is in a situation to be able to help with funding, so here's what else you can do to help us realise our campaign:</p>
<p>Spread the word! Scream it from the rooftops, tell all your friends, family &amp; neighbours, tweet about it, tag us on Instagram and mention us to anyone that can help!</p>
<p>And don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools! </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Anais Folk and I am the creator of this photo book. I am very invested in this project because throughout my whole life I was never happy with my body. I thought I was too skinny and too short. Being only 5'0"" and 86lbs, I weigh the most I ever have currently. Shooting the pictures for this book caused me to look at myself and my body in a new light. It even inspired me to pursue modeling as a part time career. Every body shape is beautiful and it took me putting myself out there to realize just how beautiful mine was. By contributing to this campaign, you will be helping me to publish the books and help spread body positivity. I am hoping this book will help other girls and guys step out of their comfort zones and maybe even do something crazy like posing nude to realize how beautiful they are and that their bodies can be art. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>I am asking for $1,000 to create this photo book. The pictures are mostly done, but I still have a few more concepts I would like to add to the book. Plus I want to send exclusive photos to backers that will require a few more shoots to complete. There is also the cost of creating, printing, and shipping the physical book itself.</li>
<li>Each different level of money gets a different perk. Some of these include exclusive digital downloads, exclusive prints both signed and unsigned, and of course a finished version of the photo book including a signed copy for certain backers.</li>
<li>If my entire goal isn't reached, the funds will go towards exclusive, signed prints and other thank you gifts for the backers that did not end up getting the photobook and towards my modeling career.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul><li>Some challenges may include the finished photo book not coming out the way I design it to. This is very easy to fix. Paying for a quality, well known, and trusted printing company that allows free reprints will ensure that the books come out the way they are intended to.

<p><strong>Einleitung</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><i>""Im Winter 2016 brachte mich meine Reise entlang der Pazifikküste in ein kleines, nur über Boot zu erreichendes, Fischerdorf im Süden des Landes, unweit der Grenze zu Guatemala. Als ich nach einer Herberge fragte, sagte eine der Frauen, die Essen verkaufte, dass es dort keine Übernachtungsmöglichkeiten gäbe. Sie lud mich spontan ein, bei ihr und ihrer Familie zu bleiben. Ich sagte zu und schlief eine Woche lang dort, inmitten der Hühner und ich wurde von ihr und ihrer Famlilie täglich bewirtet.  Ich begleitete die Männer der Familie zum Fischen, lernte andere Dorfbewohner kennen und fotografierte einige von ihnen. Als ich zum Abschied fragte, was ich ihr und ihrer Familie schuldig sei, antwortete sie, dass sie nichts von mir haben wolle. Nach langem Insistieren meinerseits, ihre Familie erschien mir  nämlich als eine der ärmsten im Dorf, konnte ich sie erst überzeugen, ein wenig Geld von mir anzunehmen, als ich sagte, dass sie ihrem neugeborenem Baby ein paar Dinge kaufen könnte.""</i></strong></p>

<div><strong>Das Projekt</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<p>Der in Berlin und Mexiko-Stadt lebende Fotograf Michael Willöfer möchte mit dieser Kampagne die Reise-und Produktionskosten für den letzten Teil seines Langzeitprojekts und die Druckkosten für das Buch <i>THE MEXICO PROJECT</i> realisieren.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Der in Berlin-Lichtenberg und -Neukölln aufgewachsene Fotograf studierte Architektur in Berlin und Mexiko-Stadt. Seine fotografische Ausbildung begann er in Amsterdam und nach mehrjährigem Aufenthalt in Mexiko-Stadt absolvierte er dort und in Montreal einen Masterstudiengang der Bildenden Kunst im Bereich Fotografie.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>THE MEXICO PROJECT</i> startete vor 3 Jahren als eine Kollaboration mit dem mexikanischen Museum <a href=""http://www.artealameda.bellasartes.gob.mx/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Laboratorio Arte Alameda</a> und für die ersten sechs Monate des Langzeitprojekts erhielt er ein Stipendium vom mexikanischen Außenministerium.</p>
<p>Der zweite Teil des Projekts und die damit einhergehende sechsmonatige Reise nach Mexiko und alle damit verbundenen Kosten wurden vom Fotografen selbst finanziert, wofür er in Berlin die meiste Zeit als Stadtführer arbeitet, der  mit dem Fahrradtaxi Touren durch die Innenstadt von Berlin anbietet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Für<i> THE MEXICO PROJECT</i> bereiste er über einen Zeitraum von insgesamt 12 Monaten verschiedene Bundesstaaten Mexikos, u.a. Chiapas, Oaxaca, Puebla, Veracruz, Estado de Mexico, Guanajuato, Morelos.</p>
<p>Inspiriert von Fotografen wie Walker Evans, Robert Frank und anderen handelt es sich bei <i>THE MEXICO PROJECT </i>um ein fotografisches Tagebuch, welches einen dialektischen Diskurs ermöglicht zwischen der krassen Realität und der optimistischen Hoffnung in dem Land<i>. </i></p>
<p>Willöfer sucht die Auseinandersetzung vor diesem historischen Kontext zwischen den politischen Problemen auf lokaler und nationaler Ebene und der ausufernden Gewalt in Mexiko auf der einen Seite und dem Abwechslungsreichtum und Schönheit der Landschaften und Menschen auf der anderen Seite.</p>
<p>Dort in den Provinzen sucht er Formen der Reflektion über die verschiedenen Facetten des Landes und nach einem neuen Gesamtbild, welches sich einerseits von puren Gewaltdarstellungen und andererseits von der reinen Folklore distanziert und dem Alltäglichen ein neues Gesicht gibt.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wenn Sie Bücher oder Drucke erwerben möchten, dann gehen Sie bitte auf <strong>BACK IT</strong> oder <strong>VIEW PERK</strong>.</p>
<p>Dort wird dann der Bestellvorgang eingeleitet.</p>

<p><strong>About the photographer</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Michael Willoefer is a German photographer and artist currently living in Berlin and Mexico City. </p>
<p>He has lived for over 7 years in Mexico City where he studied a Master Degree of fine arts at the prestigious San Carlos Academy of Arts and where he exhibited his work on various occasions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>About the project</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The <i>THE MEXICO PROJECT </i>started 3 years ago as a collaboration with the Mexican museum <a href=""http://www.artealameda.bellasartes.gob.mx/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">L</a><a href=""http://www.artealameda.bellasartes.gob.mx/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">aboratorio Arte Alameda</a> and for the first trip of 6 month he received a grant from the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>The second 6-month- trip to Mexico to work on the project was financed completely by the photographer himself.</p>
<p>He now is launching this campaign to help raise funds for covering the costs of the last of his 3 trips through Mexico and for publishing his photography book <i>THE MEXICO PROJECT.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The photos of the series were all taken on film in colour and black/white and with a medium format camera.</p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>Artist statement</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>THE MEXICO PROJECT</i> is a powerful 1,5 year photographic road-trip through the remote landscapes of Mexico.</p>
<p>Inspired by the thrilling works of photographers like Walker Evans, Robert Frank and many others, it is a conceptual photographic diary. <i>THE MEXICO PROJECT</i> is an encounter with the beauty of the Mexican landscape and its people, creating a dialectic discourse between the harsh reality and the optimistic hope for its future.</p>
<p><i>With the project THE MEXICO PROJECT I want to give back something special to all my beloved Mexican friends and all the extremely hospital people who helped during my stay in the country and during my work on this project.</i></p>
<p><i>In a time where Mexico is mostly with negative headlines in the news I want to give back a unique and eye-opening view on the country and its people. I strongly believe in a better future for them!</i></p>

<p><strong>El proyecto</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>México y su población han vivido en los últimos años un periodo de violencia por el fenómeno del narcotráfico, que ha ampliado su radio de acción a todos los ámbitos de la sociedad. Esta situación ha generado consecuencias económicas, políticas y sociales de grandes magnitudes, sobre todo creado una imagen particularmente negativa del país en el extranjero.</p>
<p>Con su proyecto <i>THE MEXICO PROJECT</i> Michael Willoefer busca alejarse de imágenes violentas explícitas, con la intención de reflexionar de una forma íntima y sublime sobre la situación actual de México. Le interesa generar una serie de fotografías en las que se aborde otra perspectiva de la vida cotidiana en las provincias, sin dejar a un lado la violencia desde una vertiente pasiva en el que aparentemente hay calma y tranquilidad.</p>
<p>A través de su obra quiere involucrar al espectador, generar empatía y una nueva conciencia. Con <i>THE MEXICO PROJECT</i> quiere seguir directamente la herencia de grandes retratistas del paisaje urbano, como Walker Evans y Robert Frank que hicieron evidente el contexto-histórico de su país fotografiando de manera novedosa. De esta manera Willoefer nos muestra un país con huellas ignoradas, que marcan un tiempo muy específico, generando una pauta sobre una forma de ver distinta el país.</p>
<p>Al fotógrafo Michael Willoefer le gustaría poder conseguir financiamiento por este medio, para los costos de producción de la última etapa de su proyecto que le ha llevado tiempo de trabajo; así como para los costos de la impresión del libro <i>México </i>como conclusión de su proyecto.</p>
<p><i>THE MEXICO PROJECT</i> comenzó hace 3 años como una colaboración con el Museo Mexicano ""Laboratorio Arte Alameda"" y durante los primeros seis meses del proyecto a largo plazo, recibió una beca por parte de la Secretaría de las Relaciones Exteriores de México. Posterior a eso, en la segunda parte del proyecto todos los costos han sido financiados por el propio fotógrafo.</p>
<p>Con <i>THE MEXICO PROJECT</i> ha recorrido varios estados de México por un período total de 12 meses entre Chiapas, Oaxaca, Puebla, Veracruz, Estado de México, Guanajuato y Morelos. El proyecto es una mezcla visual de dos géneros de la fotografía - fotografía documental y fotografía de paisaje urbano-.</p>
<p>Actualmente vive por temporadas en Berlín y la Ciudad de México. Estudió arquitectura en Berlín y la Ciudad de México. Comenzó su educación fotográfica en Amsterdam y después de vivir varios años en la Ciudad de México, consiguió estudiar una maestría en bellas artes de fotografía en la Academia de San Carlos de México y en la Concorde University de Montreal.</p>

""Im Winter 2016 brachte mich meine Reise entlang der Pazifikküste in ein kleines, nur über Boot zu erreichendes, Fischerdorf im Süden des Landes, unweit der Grenze zu Guatemala. Als ich nach einer Herberge fragte, sagte eine der Frauen, die Essen verkaufte, dass es dort keine Übernachtungsmöglichkeiten gäbe. Sie lud mich spontan ein, bei ihr und ihrer Familie zu bleiben. Ich sagte zu und schlief eine Woche lang dort, inmitten der Hühner und ich wurde von ihr und ihrer Famlilie täglich bewirtet.  Ich begleitete die Männer der Familie zum Fischen, lernte andere Dorfbewohner kennen und fotografierte einige von ihnen. Als ich zum Abschied fragte, was ich ihr und ihrer Familie schuldig sei, antwortete sie, dass sie nichts von mir haben wolle. Nach langem Insistieren meinerseits, ihre Familie erschien mir  nämlich als eine der ärmsten im Dorf, konnte ich sie erst überzeugen, ein wenig Geld von mir anzunehmen, als ich sagte, dass sie ihrem neugeborenem Baby ein paar Dinge kaufen könnte.""

Das Projekt
 
 
Der in Berlin und Mexiko-Stadt lebende Fotograf Michael Willöfer möchte mit dieser Kampagne die Reise-und Produktionskosten für den letzten Teil seines Langzeitprojekts und die Druckkosten für das Buch THE MEXICO PROJECT realisieren.
 
Der in Berlin-Lichtenberg und -Neukölln aufgewachsene Fotograf studierte Architektur in Berlin und Mexiko-Stadt. Seine fotografische Ausbildung begann er in Amsterdam und nach mehrjährigem Aufenthalt in Mexiko-Stadt absolvierte er dort und in Montreal einen Masterstudiengang der Bildenden Kunst im Bereich Fotografie.
 
THE MEXICO PROJECT startete vor 3 Jahren als eine Kollaboration mit dem mexikanischen Museum Laboratorio Arte Alameda und für die ersten sechs Monate des Langzeitprojekts erhielt er ein Stipendium vom mexikanischen Außenministerium.
Der zweite Teil des Projekts und die damit einhergehende sechsmonatige Reise nach Mexiko und alle damit verbundenen Kosten wurden vom Fotografen selbst finanziert, wofür er in Berlin die meiste Zeit als Stadtführer arbeitet, der  mit dem Fahrradtaxi Touren durch die Innenstadt von Berlin anbietet.
 
Für THE MEXICO PROJECT bereiste er über einen Zeitraum von insgesamt 12 Monaten verschiedene Bundesstaaten Mexikos, u.a. Chiapas, Oaxaca, Puebla, Veracruz, Estado de Mexico, Guanajuato, Morelos.
Inspiriert von Fotografen wie Walker Evans, Robert Frank und anderen handelt es sich bei THE MEXICO PROJECT um ein fotografisches Tagebuch, welches einen dialektischen Diskurs ermöglicht zwischen der krassen Realität und der optimistischen Hoffnung in dem Land. 
Willöfer sucht die Auseinandersetzung vor diesem historischen Kontext zwischen den politischen Problemen auf lokaler und nationaler Ebene und der ausufernden Gewalt in Mexiko auf der einen Seite und dem Abwechslungsreichtum und Schönheit der Landschaften und Menschen auf der anderen Seite.
Dort in den Provinzen sucht er Formen der Reflektion über die verschiedenen Facetten des Landes und nach einem neuen Gesamtbild, welches sich einerseits von puren Gewaltdarstellungen und andererseits von der reinen Folklore distanziert und dem Alltäglichen ein neues Gesicht gibt.

About the photographer
 
Michael Willoefer is a German photographer and artist currently living in Berlin and Mexico City. 
He has lived for over 7 years in Mexico City where he studied a Master Degree of fine arts at the prestigious San Carlos Academy of Arts and where he exhibited his work on various occasions.
 
About the project
 
The THE MEXICO PROJECT started 3 years ago as a collaboration with the Mexican museum Laboratorio Arte Alameda and for the first trip of 6 month he received a grant from the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The second 6-month- trip to Mexico to work on the project was financed completely by the photographer himself.
He now is launching this campaign to help raise funds for covering the costs of the last of his 3 trips through Mexico and for publishing his photography book THE MEXICO PROJECT.
 
The photos of the series were all taken on film in colour and black/white and with a medium format camera.
 

Artist statement
 
THE MEXICO PROJECT is a powerful 1,5 year photographic road-trip through the remote landscapes of Mexico.
Inspired by the thrilling works of photographers like Walker Evans, Robert Frank and many others, it is a conceptual photographic diary. THE MEXICO PROJECT is an encounter with the beauty of the Mexican landscape and its people, creating a dialectic discourse between the harsh reality and the optimistic hope for its future.
With the project THE MEXICO PROJECT I want to give back something special to all my beloved Mexican friends and all the extremely hospital people who helped during my stay in the country and during my work on this project.
In a time where Mexico is mostly with negative headlines in the news I want to give back a unique and eye-opening view on the country and its people. I strongly believe in a better future for them!

El proyecto
 
México y su población han vivido en los últimos años un periodo de violencia por el fenómeno del narcotráfico, que ha ampliado su radio de acción a todos los ámbitos de la sociedad. Esta situación ha generado consecuencias económicas, políticas y sociales de grandes magnitudes, sobre todo creado una imagen particularmente negativa del país en el extranjero.
Con su proyecto THE MEXICO PROJECT Michael Willoefer busca alejarse de imágenes violentas explícitas, con la intención de reflexionar de una forma íntima y sublime sobre la situación actual de México. Le interesa generar una serie de fotografías en las que se aborde otra perspectiva de la vida cotidiana en las provincias, sin dejar a un lado la violencia desde una vertiente pasiva en el que aparentemente hay calma y tranquilidad.
A través de su obra quiere involucrar al espectador, generar empatía y una nueva conciencia. Con THE MEXICO PROJECT quiere seguir directamente la herencia de grandes retratistas del paisaje urbano, como Walker Evans y Robert Frank que hicieron evidente el contexto-histórico de su país fotografiando de manera novedosa. De esta manera Willoefer nos muestra un país con huellas ignoradas, que marcan un tiempo muy específico, generando una pauta sobre una forma de ver distinta el país.
Al fotógrafo Michael Willoefer le gustaría poder conseguir financiamiento por este medio, para los costos de producción de la última etapa de su proyecto que le ha llevado tiempo de trabajo; así como para los costos de la impresión del libro México como conclusión de su proyecto.
THE MEXICO PROJECT comenzó hace 3 años como una colaboración con el Museo Mexicano ""Laboratorio Arte Alameda"" y durante los primeros seis meses del proyecto a largo plazo, recibió una beca por parte de la Secretaría de las Relaciones Exteriores de México. Posterior a eso, en la segunda parte del proyecto todos los costos han sido financiados por el propio fotógrafo.
Con THE MEXICO PROJECT ha recorrido varios estados de México por un período total de 12 meses entre Chiapas, Oaxaca, Puebla, Veracruz, Estado de México, Guanajuato y Morelos. El proyecto es una mezcla visual de dos géneros de la fotografía - fotografía documental y fotografía de paisaje urbano-.
Actualmente vive por temporadas en Berlín y la Ciudad de México. Estudió arquitectura en Berlín y la Ciudad de México. Comenzó su educación fotográfica en Amsterdam y después de vivir varios años en la Ciudad de México, consiguió estudiar una maestría en bellas artes de fotografía en la Academia de San Carlos de México y en la Concorde University de Montreal.

One of the most pleasurable experiences we can have through sound is music. It has the power to alter our feelings, emotions and relationships with our world in a wide range of ways. Our first classic Disney tune we hear when we are children, that special song we danced to at prom with what we thought was the love of our life at 16 and that time when we used Coldplay to help get over the partner that just cheated on us!

</div></div>","Summary
Our mission is to create a body of compelling images of America's public lands that will be used to further the efforts to protect our public lands.

We are committed to following our passion for photography while contributing to an endeavor of greater good.
We will produce a body of work that will concentrate on our shared public lands and preserve those images for generations to come.
We recognize the power of visual media to inspire people to act and we will use this work to collaborate with like minded organizations to fight for the protection of America's public lands.
We need support and partnerships to be successful.


What We Need & What You Get

We calculate that it will require $140,000 over the next year to fund the project.
Funds will be used to outfit our existing 2012 Toyota FJ Cruiser, purchase a suitable off-road trailer, maintain a darkroom and production space, purchase film, developing and printing supplies, cover book printings and pay for travel expenses such as food and fuel.
We want to partner with conservation organizations that can expand our audience and benefit from our content in their efforts to protect public lands.
We want to collaborate with outdoor industry manufactures on advertising and public awareness campaigns designed to raise public awareness and participation in the fight to protect our public lands.


The Impact
Public access to the spectacular natural beauty of our country is a benefit some may have taken for granted, considering most of us have never known this country without public lands.
Imagine your favorite wild and natural area declared off-limits!
This could happen if federal public lands are sold or transferred to the state for management. Efforts to decommission national monuments and  put public land into state hands for the purpose of generating state income are happening now.
These short sighted and selfish efforts must be stopped!

Risks & Challenges
Funding is not enough to make this project successful.
We need partners and collaborators with the power and urgency to jump in and multiply our audience. We want to influence more people to act. The more book and print sales we generate the more we can donate back to conservation organizations directly involved in this cause.
We need your help!

<h3>'The Invisible City': what is it?<br/>
</h3>
<p>First of all, let me introduce myself. My name is Federico Povoleri, I'm 52 years old and I am an Italian photographer, film-maker and writer (see my portfolio <a href=""www.venicevideoart.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>). During the past four years I have been exploring in depth Venice, my home city, and I took many unusual pictures of it. Using my own limited savings, I have started up a project called 'The Invisible City'.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452256318/k52ejbuhvz8czoattkwa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>#1<p></p>
<p>Through my photographs, I strive to show the true essence and soul of Venice, unseen to those visiting it.  Venice is a city that trough the millennia brought to us history and unparalleled architecture. Nevertheless, it is not a still-life exposition in a museum; it lives to a full extent trough his environment and inhabitants (the latter is too often a unappreciated perspective).</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452256763/xenb2jpnz9mirtvipyid.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 456.306px; height: 687px;""/></p>#2<p></p>
<p>Often the news are describing how Venice is suffocating and dying under the pressure of an invasion of tourists that are not showing much respect for this ancient city. What the reporters forget to point out is that the tourists are not exclusively responsible for the destruction of the city: the politicians and all the people that are taking advantage of the city with in their mind the only purpose of monetary gain they are responsible too. The ongoing exodus of inhabitants fleeing from the city is often lamented in the media, but nobody points out that there are incentives in favour of those moving outside the city limits. They forget to tell that the historical palaces, the shops and workshops have been sold out, without any care for keeping and preserving the city own culture.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452257143/xcovhnjsazeazmod4elk.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 458.959px; height: 692px;""/></p>#3<p></p>
<p>Those aforementioned are only a few aspects of what is by now a gigantic problem, since in the meantime the canal dredges and the large scale civil works (as the 'Moses' flood flap-gate barriers) have modified the ecosystem of the lagoon and provoked uncontrollable tides, as well as the waves due to boat traffic have increased the corrosion of the wooden foundation poles that held the whole city up.<br/><br/>In other words, Venice is dying. In stark contrast, the image that is shown to the rest of the world is akin to the cover of an advertising brochure, and does not reflect the soul of a place that is certainly no Disneyland.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>

<p>I am persuaded that respect comes from understanding. That is the reason why I am committed to disclosing the human nature of this city. An image can tell a story that is comprehensible to everyone: it can arouse emotions, send a message and, above all, preserve memory.</p>
<p>'The Invisible City' is not only a photographic book; it will contain also short tales in form of an imaginary dialogue between a Venetian and a tourist, in which an elderly inhabitant of Venice will recount short stories set within the 'Invisible City'.<br/></p>

<p>No Risks for contributors:<br/></p> <p> </p>In order to actualise 'The Invisible City' project, we must obtain the starting<br/>up sum by this present crow-funding campaign. The afore-mentioned sum is going<br/>to trigger the editor's contract, resulting in the book to be printed and distributed; it will not happen otherwise. That is the reason why I am compelled to utilise the 'Fixed Funding' system, which entails a few disadvantages, i.e. the limitation to PayPal only as the funding option. Should this campaign fail to reach the required amount, every payment will be refunded and, alas, the book will not go to the printer. This latter is indeed the greatest risk and the funding is the real challenge that we have to face: from the moment in which we reach the required amount onward, everything is going run smoothly downhill.<br/><br/> </div><div>

The Impact 
The book is going to count on substantial press reviews in Italy and it will be proposed to the editor's liaisons abroad, mainly in Germany, United Kingdom, France, United States and within the publish industry trade shows all over the world.
#8   Risks & Challenges
No Risks for contributors:  In order to actualise 'The Invisible City' project, we must obtain the startingup sum by this present crow-funding campaign. The afore-mentioned sum is goingto trigger the editor's contract, resulting in the book to be printed and distributed; it will not happen otherwise. That is the reason why I am compelled to utilise the 'Fixed Funding' system, which entails a few disadvantages, i.e. the limitation to PayPal only as the funding option. Should this campaign fail to reach the required amount, every payment will be refunded and, alas, the book will not go to the printer. This latter is indeed the greatest risk and the funding is the real challenge that we have to face: from the moment in which we reach the required amount onward, everything is going run smoothly downhill. 

#9Other Ways You Can Help 
'The Invisible City' needs any possible help in order to succeed. If you deemthis project to be worthy, please help to spread out the voice amongst yourfriends, and propagate this campaign between acquaintances, including the use ofsocial media as Facebook, WhatsApp etc.The warmest heartfelt thanks to you all.",19.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I bestow eternal gratitude for checking out “Cosplay 24.” Allow me to introduce myself. I am Chase Lawrence, best known as the driving force behind Affliction Cosplay Photography. My work has been featured in an array of media including <i>We Rise Magazine,</i> <i>Syfy,</i> <i>Arcade Sushi, Game Traders Live Magazine, and Birmingham News.</i> In my project proposal, “Cosplay 24,” I would like to be allowed the opportunity to photograph twenty-four (24) different cosplayers from around the United States in locations that perfectly enhance the characters they portray. These talented 24 individuals will consist of both male and female participants that will showcase their lovingly amazing costumes and props, and most importantly, their unbridled passion for the character he/she represents.</span></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With “Cosplay 24,” I wish to highlight the wonderful personalities behind the fabric and armor and explore extraordinary locations while we collaborate to produce the most incredible cosplay photography we have ever achieved. Furthermore, in addition to completing our dream to render incredible imagery, Zach Gables of Crimson Arrow Cinema will be accompanying us to document every step of the way through this journey. Collectively the Cosplay 24 team will work to produce the content for a polished documentary highlighting the successes and setbacks in completing the project. You will be able to also watch bonus behind-the-scenes footage and partake in a public Q&amp;A session upon the project's ultimate completion. Please join me and Team Cosplay 24 in our efforts to go “beyond the mask,” and we will ensure you will enjoy the ride.</p>
<p>Thank you everyone who has taken the time to check out my project! Since Cosplay 24's Kickstarter beginning, many supporters have expressed active interest in accomplishing this dream more effectively and efficiently. I recently reevaluated different methods and logistic approaches and successfully arrived at a solution. Instead of the initial Kickstarter budget, Cosplay 24 will now only require $12,000 for successful completion.<br/><br/><b>The Documentary Crew:</b><br/>Director of Cinematography:<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/zachgables"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Zach Gables</a>/ <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/zachgables"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Crimson Arrow Cinema </a><br/>Director of Photography: Chase Lawrence/ <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Afflictionphotos"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Affliction Cosplay Photography</a><br/><br/></p>
<p><b>Where does the $12,000 go?</b><br/>Travel and lodging cost for the ""Cosplay 24"" crew.<br/>Locations fees. <br/>Food for crew and cosplayers.<br/>Book publication, printing, and advertisement. <br/>Editing funding for the ""Cosplay 24"" Documentary.<br/>Backers gifts: T-shirts, prints, post cards, buttons, and paper back ""Cosplay 24"" books. <br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Shipping costs for US and World Postal<br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/><b>If we arrive at our stretch goal of $14,000, Cosplay 24: The Documentary will then evolve into DVD form for our supporters!

</div><div> <p></p>
<p>Ever since discovering the world of cosplay during my high school years 6 years ago, my enthusiasm to photograph cosplayers has been addictive and constant. Since cosplay has been more widely recognized and accepted as a positive outlet in recent years, I want to highlight the variety of people involved in this creative venture.</p>
<p>Over the years, I have seen people grow both as cosplayers and as personal individuals. Skill sets have tremendously expanded, and their upbeat enthusiasm has only become more intense. Both of which are clearly marked in the final products of fine craftsmanship and presentation as they mesmerize other fans with excitement and nostalgia. Though, as onlookers and bystanders, we often forget to recognize the persons behind the fantastic costumes.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>This project will combine the possibility of many risks such as: equipment failure, models being unable to appear due to sickness or issues, weather not cooperating, flights getting cancelled, or getting stuck in the fourth dimension of some alien planet. Haha I'm joking about the last one, but my crew and I have back up gear, models, extra flight plans, and plenty of time to sort things out as they should be. This will be a great struggle, but with your help, I believe my crew and I can accomplish this project.<br/><br/><b>Reassurance: </b><br/>We will be keeping a book of all purchases meaning everything that will be paid for will be posted online after the completion of the project so that you can see our expenses. Receipts will be kept for the public to view to show that the backers money is going to the project itself.<br/><br/><b>When the book is completed :</b><br/>After the book is finished In Honor of my Grandfather and Grandmother Jerry Lee Stivener, and Roseann Stivener that passed away November 22, 2008 , and December 22, 2014. Money left over from the project after taxes along with 10% of all book proceeds will be donated to The American Cancer Society for colon rectal cancer. My grandparents will also be honored as supporters for the book as well.<br/> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>The old-fashioned way!

This love of fitness began with his desire to have a body that looked like Sylvester Stallone's in the mid 80's, heavily being inspired by the Rocky movies.

</div></div>","Short Summary 
I bestow eternal gratitude for checking out “Cosplay 24.” Allow me to introduce myself. I am Chase Lawrence, best known as the driving force behind Affliction Cosplay Photography. My work has been featured in an array of media including We Rise Magazine, Syfy, Arcade Sushi, Game Traders Live Magazine, and Birmingham News. In my project proposal, “Cosplay 24,” I would like to be allowed the opportunity to photograph twenty-four (24) different cosplayers from around the United States in locations that perfectly enhance the characters they portray. These talented 24 individuals will consist of both male and female participants that will showcase their lovingly amazing costumes and props, and most importantly, their unbridled passion for the character he/she represents.
  What We Need & What You Get
With “Cosplay 24,” I wish to highlight the wonderful personalities behind the fabric and armor and explore extraordinary locations while we collaborate to produce the most incredible cosplay photography we have ever achieved. Furthermore, in addition to completing our dream to render incredible imagery, Zach Gables of Crimson Arrow Cinema will be accompanying us to document every step of the way through this journey. Collectively the Cosplay 24 team will work to produce the content for a polished documentary highlighting the successes and setbacks in completing the project. You will be able to also watch bonus behind-the-scenes footage and partake in a public Q&A session upon the project's ultimate completion. Please join me and Team Cosplay 24 in our efforts to go “beyond the mask,” and we will ensure you will enjoy the ride.
Thank you everyone who has taken the time to check out my project! Since Cosplay 24's Kickstarter beginning, many supporters have expressed active interest in accomplishing this dream more effectively and efficiently. I recently reevaluated different methods and logistic approaches and successfully arrived at a solution. Instead of the initial Kickstarter budget, Cosplay 24 will now only require $12,000 for successful completion.The Documentary Crew:Director of Cinematography: Zach Gables/ Crimson Arrow Cinema Director of Photography: Chase Lawrence/ Affliction Cosplay Photography
Where does the $12,000 go?Travel and lodging cost for the ""Cosplay 24"" crew.Locations fees. Food for crew and cosplayers.Book publication, printing, and advertisement. Editing funding for the ""Cosplay 24"" Documentary.Backers gifts: T-shirts, prints, post cards, buttons, and paper back ""Cosplay 24"" books. Shipping costs for US and World PostalIf we arrive at our stretch goal of $14,000, Cosplay 24: The Documentary will then evolve into DVD form for our supporters! That will be added as a extra gift to perks $80-$500 Choices 
The Impact
 
Ever since discovering the world of cosplay during my high school years 6 years ago, my enthusiasm to photograph cosplayers has been addictive and constant. Since cosplay has been more widely recognized and accepted as a positive outlet in recent years, I want to highlight the variety of people involved in this creative venture.
Over the years, I have seen people grow both as cosplayers and as personal individuals. Skill sets have tremendously expanded, and their upbeat enthusiasm has only become more intense. Both of which are clearly marked in the final products of fine craftsmanship and presentation as they mesmerize other fans with excitement and nostalgia. Though, as onlookers and bystanders, we often forget to recognize the persons behind the fantastic costumes.   Risks & Challenges  This project will combine the possibility of many risks such as: equipment failure, models being unable to appear due to sickness or issues, weather not cooperating, flights getting cancelled, or getting stuck in the fourth dimension of some alien planet. Haha I'm joking about the last one, but my crew and I have back up gear, models, extra flight plans, and plenty of time to sort things out as they should be. This will be a great struggle, but with your help, I believe my crew and I can accomplish this project.Reassurance: We will be keeping a book of all purchases meaning everything that will be paid for will be posted online after the completion of the project so that you can see our expenses. Receipts will be kept for the public to view to show that the backers money is going to the project itself.When the book is completed :After the book is finished In Honor of my Grandfather and Grandmother Jerry Lee Stivener, and Roseann Stivener that passed away November 22, 2008 , and December 22, 2014. Money left over from the project after taxes along with 10% of all book proceeds will be donated to The American Cancer Society for colon rectal cancer. My grandparents will also be honored as supporters for the book as well.   Other Ways You Can Help The old-fashioned way!

<h3>The Concept</h3>
<p>Both Rocky and I think there's far too much negativity and lonliness in the world today. If you follow us on Instagram (@rockydoggins if you don't), you probably know by now one of the things we value is trying to stay positive and finding silver linings when life shits on you.</p>
<p>That said, on March 10th for a minimum of 10 days: Rocky, myself and an assistant will be embarking on The Rocky Doggins West Coast Togetherness Tour: an interactive road trip all about bringing people together and putting at little happiness into peoples' lives, while creating a unique and interactive experience for those of you making this trip possible through your contributions.</p>
<p>The Rocky Doggins West Coast Togetherness Tour begins in Vancouver, BC, then continues through to the scenic Pacific Coast Highway down Washington. Then we hit Oregon (with a detour to the wonderful city of Portland). Next is the California coastline: San Francisco all the way down to San Diego. Once we're done, we'll head straight back up the I-5 hitting all the main attractions along the main freeway, then back home to Vancouver. </p>
<p>One thing that can't be stressed enough is that we do NOT want anybody to feel obligated to donate. This is intended to be as fun and engaging experience and we understand not all our supporters have the means to donate! However, we like to give back how we can: so we'll be creating some personalized content as an extra thank you to our contributors.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What Do We Need To Make This Happen?</h3>
<p>In a nutshell, as much as you can help with. The more we can raise, the more we can make the trip more interactive and engaging! And hopefully with enough funds raised, extend it a few days! </p>
<p>As of right now we're looking for a bit of help with the basics.</p>
<p>Asking for $3750, this is a complete breakdown of where the funds will go:</p>
<p><strong>Car Rental </strong>- $750 - We currently plan on renting a mid sized sedan. Something with enough room, but not overkill. After a bit of research, a car for $75/day should cover the basics.</p>
<p><strong>Gas</strong> - $600 - A rough estimate for about 7000 miles calculated with the typical gas mileage of a car the size of one we will be renting.</p>
<p><strong>Lodging</strong> - $600 - While we plan on doing a good deal of camping, there's something to be said for spending a few nights inside. $60/night on average for a mix of hotels and camping.</p>
<p><strong>Camping Gear </strong>- $300 - We need a decent compliment of camping gear to make this happen. There's not much point in buying new, so we did some costing at a used camping goods store. We can get absolutely everything we need to stay alive for just around $300.</p>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous Supplies</strong> - $350 - Think the stuff behind the scenes. A GOOD roadside emergency kit, a first aid kit for 2 people and a dog, maps, a repair kit, gas cans etc. All the stuff that you don't normally think about.</p>
<p><strong>Emergency Fund</strong> - $750 - Gotta have that fallback fund. Breakdowns, tows, medical emergencies, unexpected vet trips &amp; other shit that can go wrong that I can't even begin to imagine.</p>
<p>There are obviously more costs to this whole thing, but I'll be taking care of those costs myself. Camera gear, cell phone plans, paying my assistant, extra insurances, personal gear, the list goes on. We're not looking to have the WHOLE trip funded. Just some help!</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>What's In It For You, The Donor?</h3>
<p>Well now time for the fun bit! The part of all of this that makes The Rocky Doggins West Coast Togetherness Tour! unique. Like we said before, this is all about togetherness. We want to be together with you guys while we're on this adventure, so we want to make it as interactive and tailored to our fans as possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE MEAN BY THAT</strong></p>
<p>It's simple. When you donate, you get to be a part of this entire tour! Every single donation received will get a post, shout-out, tag and personalized message of some variety on the official @rockydoggins Instagram.</p>
<p>That is to say, depending on how much you donate, we will give you a post (might be a picture, might be a video) on either the @rockydoggins Instagram Stories or with enough donated, a main profile picture post. We will also send you a digital, full-size copy of the photo we post for you, as a little memento for you, and if you want, to share it on your other social media.</p>
<p>The message in the post is totally up to you! It can be to someone special, it can be promoting yourself or a business/product, or if you want, we can even make a little message from us to you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Here, let's break it down a little more, in straight donation-to-reward terms:</strong></p>
<p><b>$5 Donation - </b>You get a tag and a small personal message on an Instagram Stories post. Instagram Stories will be the main device we'll be using to cover this road trip. It will have all of the day-to-day, hour-to-hour, minute-to-minute stuff. The behind the scenes and weird stuff.</p>
<p><strong>$10 Donation - </strong>You get the same as above, Stories post, tag and small message, and you'll also receive a thank you post card featuring a prominent image from the tour.</p>
<p><b>$20 Donation - </b>A limited amount of these. More meant to reward the early helpers. A $20 donation will get you a post on the main @rockydoggins profile. The main profile will be where all the big highlights of the trip go. The more polished shots, and familiar locations. Again, a post with a tag and personal message. You'll also get a thank you post card.</p>
<p><strong>$25 Donation - </strong>This is for after the $20 dollar level runs out.  A $25 donation will get you a shared post on the main @rockydoggins profile. Instead of having your own post, you will share a highlight post with a few others. Don't fret though, everyone in the post will get their own shout-out, tag and personalized message. Also, a thank you post card.</p>
<b>$50 Donation - </b>Again, a limited amount. This level will get you the same as the $20 level (a main profile post to yourself, post card), BUT you also get a comfy, limited edition t-shirt that will feature a picture and artwork specific to the tour.<p><br/><strong>$100 Donation - </strong>Only a handful of these. Same perks as the $50 level (post to yourself, post card, t-shirt), but you get to choose the location and subject of your post! (Except the 4 locations outlined in the $250 and $500 donation tiers).</p>
<p><b>$250 Donation - </b>3 of these. These are for the main @rockydoggins profile posts for prime locations. The icons. One for each state.</p>
<p>Washington - Space Needle, Seattle.<br/>Oregon - The Gigantic Keep Portland Weird sign in Portland (this one is gonna be funnnnn!)<br/>California - Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco</p>
<p>This tier also gets the limited edition t-shirt and thank you postcard.</p>
<p><strong>$500 Donation - </strong>Just one. For the biggest landmark of them all. The gigantic white HOLLYWOOD sign in Los Angeles. For a $500 donation, you get the post featuring probably the most recognizable icon of film, and best known sign in America. All complete with a special personalized video message from us, to you posted on the main @rockydoggins profile. Here as well, you get the thank you post card and limited edition t-shirt.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Important Note: </strong>All main profile posts will have Rocky in frame, while the Story posts may or may not. We'll do our best to make sure you can see Rocky in all Story posts, but can't promise, as there may be something fun or important to see that we don't have time to set up properly. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>So There You Have It!</strong></p>
<p>We hope now you can see where we're going with this! You help us spread a few good vibes and a some smiles, we give you fun, creative, unique and uplifting content, in new locations. All tailored for and by you, the fans.</p>
<p>And if you do decide to donate, get message us with an email address or your Instagram username so we can start talking perks!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Could Possibly Go Wrong??</h3>
<p>I mean honestly, for you, the donor, not much. We're not promising the world. We really want to drive home that this is going to be an important ongoing personal project important to Rocky and I. This tour is happening regardless of funding here. We would just like a little help. </p>
<p>Because of the nature of this fundraiser, any perks promised will absolutely 100% easily be honored. Any physical perks, we fully expect to ship within 7-10 days of arriving home. (Time to select imagery, procure merchandise etc).</p>
<p>We also want to stress, again, that we in no way, shape or form want anyone to feel pressured to donate. Only give if you like and see the value in the fun of The Rocky Doggins West Coast Togetherness Tour!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you want to help but can't use IndieGoGo, for whatever reason, let us know! Maybe we can work out an alternative.</p>
<p>If you can't contribute monetarily, do not feel bad even a little. The whole point of this entire thing is spreading positivity. If you want to help but can't, consider just giving us a share or a post on social media. Who knows if you know someone that wants in???</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Any questions? Ask away! We'll build a FAQ as the questions come!</h3>

<p>90s nostalgia is entering full bloom.  Generation X came of age listening to this music and it was these songs that millennials cut their teeth on. I am one of those Gen Xers that grew up with this music and love it almost as passionately as I love 80s music, the subject of my previous book, “80s Redux.”</p>
<p>I set out to create engaging portraits of the artists of the 90s and find out more about their time in the limelight and where their lives have taken them. Their answers were open, honest, inspiring, and revealing. They offered profound and often funny gems of wisdom that will resonate with their fans and music lovers in general.</p>
<p>There have been quite a few artist memoirs that have received a lot of attention over the past year or so – books from Sleater-Kinney’s Carrie Brownstein, Sonic Youth’s Kim Gordon, Red Hot Chili Peppers Flea among others – that clearly show a thirst for stories from the indie rock decade. My book gathers artists from this spectrum and beyond to tell their stories and showcase them with beautiful photographs that show them in their current light. Artists in the book include Krist Novoselic from Nirvana, Tanya Donnelly from Belly/The Breeders/Throwing Muses, Ben Lee, Tjinder Singh from Cornershop, and many others.</p>
<p>The book is nearly ready to go - the photography is done, the writing nearly complete, and I've got a great partner with Girl Friday Productions.  This book will be one of the first under their new publishing umbrella that is a hybrid of self-publishing/traditional publisher model.  Funds earned  from this campaign go to the printing and editing of the book.  It's expected for a holiday 2021 release.</p>

<h3>You're invited to be a part of producing <strong>INSTRUMENTHEAD REVEALED</strong> - the fine art, hardcover companion book to INSTRUMENTHEAD, where photographer Michael Weintrob unmasks these musicians in a way that you've never seen before.</h3>
<h3>INSTRUMENTHEAD REVEALED</h3>
<p>In 2017, after a successful INDIGOGO campaign, I was able to self-publish the award-winning INSTRUMENTHEAD, a fine art photography book where I portray musicians with their instruments covering their face.</p>
<p><strong>In my new book, INSTRUMENTHEAD REVEALED, I will be unmasking the INSTRUMENTHEADS. </strong>You'll see all the same musicians in the same order, but you can see their faces. The new book will become a key to the original, giving you a deeper more in depth look at the scope of this work. To learn more about the backstory, click the image at the top of the page to watch our video. Complete your INSTRUMENTHEAD collection with this new book, or if you are new to the project you can purchase both books through this campaign. </p>

<h3><strong>What We Need and What You Will Receive:</strong></h3>
<p>To accomplish our goal of creating a companion book to the original INSTRUMENTHEAD we are going back to the same printer in Italy. We discovered many costs associated that we did not calculate in the first crowd funding campaign.  This time around our fundraising goal is higher to account for these extra costs.  With your support we will be able to make this happen.</p>
<p>We have got some really great incentives at every price point, including the book, a box set including the first INSTRUMENTHEAD book in a decretive box, a photo shoot and even your own INSTRUMENTHEAD exhibit. </p>
<p><strong>Additionally we are offering 15% off on all prints including INSTRUMENTHEAD and INSTRUMENTHEAD REVEALED. You can add this to your cart on the check out page by scrolling down and choosing your size. </strong>Not sure what print you want?

<h3>The Backstory</h3>
<p>Over the last decade, I have been on the road showing my INSTRUMENTHEAD work through immersive art exhibitions and connecting with the public. I love seeing people's reaction to the images and diving into conversations about the art. One of the comments I often hear is ""I wish I could see their faces."" Well you're in luck...  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1621266992/mr2gvlrarr6hedkl0jlz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>While creating this body of work, I also photographed the musicians where their faces were not obscured. They would show up with clothes, instruments and possessions to serve as clues for the guessing game in the INSTRUMENTHEAD portrait. By photographing in this setting I was able to shoot an honest portrait. </p>
<p><strong>I have had the opportunity to sit with this work over the pandemic and I believe now is the time to unmask the INSTRUMENTHEADS.</strong></p>
<p>Many of the musicians I have photographed are “sidemen” and have performed with some of the biggest names in music. The harmonica solo on WAR's hit song ""Low Rider"" by Lee Oskar. The funky trombone sound of Fred Wesley that you hear on many James Brown and Parliment Funkadelic recordings. Tina Weymouth's bass grooves on every Talking Heads song.  The list goes on and on.</p>

<p><i>Zakir Hussain</i></p>
<p>I have always loved traveling to different parts of the world and learning about their indigenous music. In this book you will also see portraits of many musicians with their instruments and traditional dress. Cyro Baptista from Brazil with his pandero and berimbau. Zakir Hussain with an assortment of Tablas from India.  Wu Fei with her Guzheng from China. Hopefully these images will inspire you to learn more about the diversity of music around the world.</p>

<p><i>Wu Fei</i></p>
<p>At the start of this project, I was based out of my Brooklyn Studio where I photographed many of the musicians for this book.  When I wasn't shooting in my studio I traveled all over setting up pop-up studios everywhere from backyards to music venues, from New Orleans to Cape Town.  In this book there are 366 different artists. </p>

<h3><strong>Risks and Challenges </strong></h3>
<p>This is my second time crowd funding a book. The first time I learned so many valuable lessons that will allow this production to run so much more smoothly. I know what the design will be, where I am printing the book and when it will be printed.  I have a super solid team that worked with me on the first production and I feel confident that we have stream lined the process and have realistic expectations for delivering an amazing book.</p>

Over the last decade, I have been on the road showing my INSTRUMENTHEAD work through immersive art exhibitions and connecting with the public. I love seeing people's reaction to the images and diving into conversations about the art. One of the comments I often hear is ""I wish I could see their faces."" Well you're in luck...  

While creating this body of work, I also photographed the musicians where their faces were not obscured. They would show up with clothes, instruments and possessions to serve as clues for the guessing game in the INSTRUMENTHEAD portrait. By photographing in this setting I was able to shoot an honest portrait. 
I have had the opportunity to sit with this work over the pandemic and I believe now is the time to unmask the INSTRUMENTHEADS.
Many of the musicians I have photographed are “sidemen” and have performed with some of the biggest names in music. The harmonica solo on WAR's hit song ""Low Rider"" by Lee Oskar. The funky trombone sound of Fred Wesley that you hear on many James Brown and Parliment Funkadelic recordings. Tina Weymouth's bass grooves on every Talking Heads song.  The list goes on and on.

Zakir Hussain
I have always loved traveling to different parts of the world and learning about their indigenous music. In this book you will also see portraits of many musicians with their instruments and traditional dress. Cyro Baptista from Brazil with his pandero and berimbau. Zakir Hussain with an assortment of Tablas from India.  Wu Fei with her Guzheng from China. Hopefully these images will inspire you to learn more about the diversity of music around the world.

Wu Fei
At the start of this project, I was based out of my Brooklyn Studio where I photographed many of the musicians for this book.  When I wasn't shooting in my studio I traveled all over setting up pop-up studios everywhere from backyards to music venues, from New Orleans to Cape Town.  In this book there are 366 different artists.

Risks and Challenges 
This is my second time crowd funding a book. The first time I learned so many valuable lessons that will allow this production to run so much more smoothly. I know what the design will be, where I am printing the book and when it will be printed.  I have a super solid team that worked with me on the first production and I feel confident that we have stream lined the process and have realistic expectations for delivering an amazing book.

<h3><u><i><strong>Overview</strong></i></u></h3>
<p><i><strong>Walking on a Blade: Life in the time of Coronavirus</strong></i> is a collective photobook, and a beautiful assemblage of powerful, captivating imagery, a compendium depicting a profound, moving, and unforgettable age in our shared history. </p>
<p><i>Walking on a Blade exposes the invisible threats, the risks and struggles of daily workers trying to survive amidst the outbreak of Coronavirus in Iran.</i></p>
<h3>
<br/><u><strong><i>Community Voices</i></strong></u>
</h3>
<p>There are far more threats to society caused by the COVID-19 pandemic than are immediately apparent from the surface or what we see in today's media coverage. Ordinary workers and small business owners in less developed countries such as Iran place themselves on the front lines every day without access to proper protective equipment such as masks, and gloves. They face great penalties for doing so since the alternative is the grave.</p>
<p><strong><i>Walking on a Blade</i></strong> is a result of our revered photographers' hard and vigorous work, and contains unique and previously unseen images by our outstanding international team of photojournalists and is sure to incite a powerful emotional response amongst its readers. Along with our associate, the Pulitzer Center, and support from dozens of professionals worldwide. Our book is the epitome of professional photojournalism in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619739219/dcbukpr8vn9yf3l6nuvh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our book features first-hand personal accounts of the Pandemic as it unfolded in a multitude of countries. It is full of commentaries by some of the world's most renowned photojournalists. Moreover, it is designed and conceived by a brilliant graphic &amp; text designer and printed by a masterful printing house.</p>
<p>This tremendous project is produced by people of color, marginalized front-liners who worked arduously to bring this project to fruition. As a centerpiece or as part of a collection, it is a historic and impressive work that will impact both the viewer and the reader alike.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>Stunning mosaic of stories</i></strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">From nail technicians to rug weavers, to ‘carriers’ who survive by pushing goods for people on metal carts, to music teachers, boxing instructors and those who bury the dead, the photographs offer a rare and intimate window into the Iranian society, a country that the West knows so little about. They also reveal more universal themes. It’s Iran but it could easily be Argentina, where I was born, or Romania, India, Lebanon and even pockets of the United States or England. Inequality knows no borders, and it has become the definitive and most urgent story of our time.   </p>

<h3><u><strong><i>Introduction to the book</i></strong></u></h3>
<p>These are hard and tragic times. We are all suffering.</p>
<p>The global Pandemic has claimed more than 2.36 million lives and continues to affect and disrupt everything with seemingly no end. There are over 500k dead in the US of A alone.  A century ago, our civilization was devastated by a similar pandemic commonly known as the ""Spanish Flu."" Fifty million souls vanished, yet there is little to no easily accessible information about this event.</p>
<p>During these unprecedented times, journalism and intimate personal testimony are crucial. Future generations will see the global pandemic as a turning point in history. However, it will be hard for them to imagine what this plight and struggle was like without objective on the ground photographic evidence.</p>
<p><i>Walking on a Blade</i> is a revelatory journey into the unseen life, a window into the world of the voiceless by those that can have their voice heard. Our book is sure to leave a lasting impression on the reader, featuring powerful imagery and poignant personal accounts of life during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is also an intimate and introspective retelling of the day-to-day life of our esteemed members.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619738943/fazxnjiwmaywtqgkli52.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The photographic record of the 1918 ""Spanish Flu"" pandemic is lacking; period accounts are few and next to none. Even worse, there is hardly any visual evidence to corroborate that colossal incident in our not too distant past, partly due to the inaccessibility and technical barriers of the photographic medium and the fact that it coincided with the November 1918 armistice. </p>
<p>Why does the suffering continue? Why are we not prepared for these sorts of calamities? Why must innocent people pay such a dearly price in this time of supposed ""enlightenment?"" These are essential questions in dire need of answers. Perhaps we should spend more time addressing these issues than focusing on material gain, commerce, personal riches and geopolitical affairs. After all, what is the point of existing if we cannot defeat a deadly, transmittable, yet curable virus? If we all die, who will reap the benefits? So many unanswered and unaddressed questions.     </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619739272/ichgfeuk8athb8ytchxr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Walking on a Blade: Life in the time of Coronavirus </i>is the collective result of our revered photographers' hard and vigorous work. Our courageous members set their well-being and safety aside to document life as it has been since the onset of this devastating virus. Along with our associate, the Pulitzer Center, and support from dozens of professionals worldwide. Our book is the epitome of professional photojournalism in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. </p>
<p>It is now 2021; we live in an era of unparalleled access to useful, objective, peer-reviewed information. Nevertheless, the casualty count keeps rising, and so does the number of infected. To make matters worse, new variants of the novel (new) Coronavirus disease keep emerging. What have we done wrong? How many more need to perish and suffer before we address this deadly respiratory disease efficiently and responsibly.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619741588/dc4sgfjlxymroxrvru66.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It has been 103 years since the ""Spanish Flu"" epidemic, yet we've done little to nothing to improve our response towards respiratory illnesses. Little to nothing to avoid this calamity. Covid-19 has destroyed countless lives because of stagnant and incompetent reactions by those entrusted with our wellbeing.</p>
<p>Even our global economy, robust and complicated as it may be, is now on its toes. Our pharmaceutical companies who pride themselves on bringing us cures for every ailment and discomfort struggle to deal with the reality that their patients will not die from cholesterol, heart failure, diabetes, depression, hypertension, STD's and cancer but Coronavirus.</p>
<p>Moreover, our logistical ingenuities, which span the globe, and are excellent at delivering commercial goods to our doorstep, are failing us during this distressful time. We don't need iPhones, Avocados, Cocoa beans or PlayStations; we need vaccines.</p>
<p><i>Walking on a Blade</i> is a formidable visual indictment for those who needlessly suffer from oppression and geopolitical discrimination, as well as a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and collective will to surpass this dark point in our history. Hopefully, with this book, our progeny will do better and learn from our mistakes.   </p>

<h3><u><i><strong>This is where we ask for your help! </strong></i></u></h3>
<p>The quality and standards we hold for this book are high. We sought to create a small time capsule of ourselves so that later we might realize that aside from all the troubles and darkness, hope and the passion for living became our survival kit. A survival kit to assist humankind in overcoming these obstacles and a means of passing the torch of life to the next generation.</p>
<p>The costs needed for the final stages included editing, printing, and marketing. We have spent 12 months waist-deep in the creative process.</p>
<p>Our book represents something different, an anthology of unique voices that hold the power to cross into new territory and shift culture. All of this has made us realize that we are destined to publish our baby at the grassroots level!</p>
<p>So we are asking for help in raising $20,000 to independently publish and expose our book by the spring of 2021. We can no longer do this alone and would be sincerely humbled and grateful beyond measure for your contribution.</p>

<p>A testament to a time when everything stood still. This book aims to depict the Coronavirus Pandemic as it unfolded and propagated throughout the world. 2020 was an unforgettable and tragic year that impacted millions. However, like many critical moments in human history, they are destined to be forgotten if not comprehensively documented. This book serves as proof for further generations to avoid our mistakes, and when, not if, a Pandemic occurs again, they shall be better prepared to deal with it. They will have irrefutable visual evidence showing just what happened and why.</p>
<p>Your contribution will help us raise awareness about the devastation caused by Coronavirus, unmute the muted, and save lives.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>Far Beyond The Stereotypes</i></strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Against this generalizing sorting by mechanical eyes, the photographs published in this book remind us that the real Iran exists on the ground and show in a sophisticated, singular and individualized way, that human stories are only made possible due to two conditions: physical proximity and the eyes of Iranians themselves. This book meets this challenge with excellence.</p>

<h3><u><i><strong>Why Crowdsourcing</strong></i></u></h3>
<p>First, and probably most importantly, we want to keep the price of this book as low as possible, and that's the reason why we need you as our supporters. This project represents the power of community and togetherness, and we want as many people as possible to be a part of its making.</p>
<p>We have put a tremendous amount of trust into the higher purpose of this project, understanding that it is in service to something much greater than ourselves.  The first person we interviewed was back in January 2020, and since then over 30 people have entrusted their stories to the co-creation of this living, breathing vision. It is our great privilege to bring such a powerful collection out from the shadows, as an appeal that might ripple out into the world and create meaningful and profound change.  </p>
<p>In this unprecedented time in modern history, technology has given us the facility to reach many through the most straightforward and immediate means, the internet. With its many caveats, crowdsourcing is still to date the most efficient and prolific method of raising funds for trustworthy and legitimate purposes. We at NVP Images have selected the IndieGoGo platform for this sensitive task. Crowdsourcing has extended our broadcast, allowing us to reach as many people as possible so that they may help us achieve our goal. The contributions made to this fund will assist us in continuing our endeavor to document and distribute critical grassroots front-line journalism that gives the voiceless a chance to be seen and heard.</p>

<h3><u><strong><i>The Passion of Life</i></strong></u></h3>
<p><strong><i>Editor's note on the creation of Walking On A Blade</i></strong></p>
<p>Since late March 2020, when we decided to go ahead with the coronavirus project at the agency, I had to develop a system to control our produced material as it was coming in from different places.</p>
<p>We had eight photographers in Iran, focusing on specific, narrow, and challenging subjects of Iranian society. Their task was to focus on the middle and lower classes of the nation, including daily workers who had to keep working despite the pandemic and the country’s lockdowns as there were no other alternatives for them.  This project is named ‘Walking On A Blade.’</p>
<p>Then we had one other visual storyteller based in Canada (like myself) and another in Norway, who worked on more personal and in-depth stories of the impact of the pandemic on their inner family circles. This project is named ‘Life in the time of Corona.’</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619742673/tbuwav7iuocd93gew6bo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Apart from those two projects, we had three other photojournalists in Iran, reporting on COVID-19 frontline-fighters. That project is called ‘Disinfecting Iran.’</p>
<p>In the middle of the preparation phase, the Pulitzer Center selected our first project as one of the COVID-19 projects to collaborate with and fund. The window for working without a timeline began to close, and I needed to stay on top of all the projects.</p>
<p>As a senior editor, I started to design digital contact sheets from the photo selection we had from every story we received from each photographer in Iran. Based on the time we had and the project's complexity, I had to write short notes or key points on the contact sheets to pinpoint and clarify some subtexts, mark a few as my first selections, and forward them to other editors either in Iran or Canada. They would then make their own selections, mark them with a different color, and send the sheets back to me. Afterwards, I would look to see which images had both marks: mine and the other editor’s. These selections were then added to the general pool for the project's pitch. </p>
<p>While we were reaching out to publications and media outlets to introduce our project, we went through every single contact sheet again. We chose from the broader selection for each narrative for the purpose of solo presentation. Some projects had the potential to stand alone as their own story, while others were only good for collective work. </p>
<p>By mid-May 2020, based on the produced material, the agency decided to create multimedia, as well as publish a book as another final product. After carefully reviewing our options, we hired a very talented musician and composer, Rouzbeh Esfandarmaz and his company PAMARO in the Netherlands, to conduct an original song for the multimedia segment. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619742721/cq2qpqetw1biydfiw1d5.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The second move was to choose a book designer and start the long journey of book publishing. After all the considerations and based on our long-standing work relations, the agency decided to collaborate with Kaveh Ashourinia, an artist with a creative and complex mind, from Toronto, Canada. His company, Beak Studio, started to plan and design the book while we were completing the projects. This was a challenging process for him as the project wasn't finished, and he and his team had to be flexible with us. We had weekly and then near-daily meetings, to help the book progress properly.  </p>
<p>As the project proceeded to the final section, our team was already all over the globe. Aside from our 14 photographers from 3 countries, we had one translator in California, USA, another two translators in Toronto, Canada, and a copy editor in Barcelona, Spain. This project is the final product of 28 dedicated souls from 12 cities, six countries, and three continents. Regardless of all the hardship and troubles of working in the quarantine amidst the coronavirus pandemic, they dedicated their time and love unconditionally to this project to portray substantial evidence of the unprecedented time and unique global crisis that future generations will look back to for years to come. </p>
<p>‘Walking On A Blade’ is a small-time capsule of ourselves, so that later we might realize that aside from all the troubles and darkness of our time, hope and <i>The Passion Of Life</i> became the survival kit to assist humankind in overcoming the obstacles and passing the torch of life and living to the next generation.</p>

<h3><u><i><strong>Risks</strong></i></u></h3>
<p>The project is well underway. We dedicated every second of our time planning, editing, proofing, and finally pre-printing the book during the past year. It was challenging to materialize and produce this anthology due to the many delays brought by the Coronavirus pandemic. It was equally demanding on our esteemed collaborators who risked their health and well-being to capture and document the contents of this book. In addition to that, we faced complexities and delays during the printing process.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we are pleased to announce that the book is essentially ready, and our graphic designer Kaveh Nia, worked hard to have every page finished on time. Moreover, the beautifully designed artistic cover by Kaveh Nia is ready. After a year of intensive labor, our magnificent opus is complete. Thanks to our devoted team of tireless visual artists and professionals.</p>
<p>There are always factors outside of our control, printing problems, shipping delays, and unexpected glitches that may arise. We are confident that none of these potential issues will occur, but we live in a strange, tumultuous, and chaotic time. The Coronavirus pandemic might have an impact on shipping and logistics. If this were to happen, we would continuously keep our backers updated and immediately inform them of any changes or delays.  </p>

</div></div>","Overview
Walking on a Blade: Life in the time of Coronavirus is a collective photobook, and a beautiful assemblage of powerful, captivating imagery, a compendium depicting a profound, moving, and unforgettable age in our shared history. 
Walking on a Blade exposes the invisible threats, the risks and struggles of daily workers trying to survive amidst the outbreak of Coronavirus in Iran.

Community Voices

There are far more threats to society caused by the COVID-19 pandemic than are immediately apparent from the surface or what we see in today's media coverage. Ordinary workers and small business owners in less developed countries such as Iran place themselves on the front lines every day without access to proper protective equipment such as masks, and gloves. They face great penalties for doing so since the alternative is the grave.
Walking on a Blade is a result of our revered photographers' hard and vigorous work, and contains unique and previously unseen images by our outstanding international team of photojournalists and is sure to incite a powerful emotional response amongst its readers. Along with our associate, the Pulitzer Center, and support from dozens of professionals worldwide. Our book is the epitome of professional photojournalism in the 21st century.

Our book features first-hand personal accounts of the Pandemic as it unfolded in a multitude of countries. It is full of commentaries by some of the world's most renowned photojournalists. Moreover, it is designed and conceived by a brilliant graphic & text designer and printed by a masterful printing house.
This tremendous project is produced by people of color, marginalized front-liners who worked arduously to bring this project to fruition. As a centerpiece or as part of a collection, it is a historic and impressive work that will impact both the viewer and the reader alike.

 

We are also proud to mention that this project has received the prestigious Pulitzer Center Grant, one of the most sought-after and respected grants in photojournalism.
Walking On a Blade, has been globally published and featured in major publications such as Der Spiegel, VG, Titre, and Zenith.

Stunning mosaic of stories
From nail technicians to rug weavers, to ‘carriers’ who survive by pushing goods for people on metal carts, to music teachers, boxing instructors and those who bury the dead, the photographs offer a rare and intimate window into the Iranian society, a country that the West knows so little about. They also reveal more universal themes. It’s Iran but it could easily be Argentina, where I was born, or Romania, India, Lebanon and even pockets of the United States or England. Inequality knows no borders, and it has become the definitive and most urgent story of our time.

Introduction to the book
These are hard and tragic times. We are all suffering.
The global Pandemic has claimed more than 2.36 million lives and continues to affect and disrupt everything with seemingly no end. There are over 500k dead in the US of A alone.  A century ago, our civilization was devastated by a similar pandemic commonly known as the ""Spanish Flu."" Fifty million souls vanished, yet there is little to no easily accessible information about this event.
During these unprecedented times, journalism and intimate personal testimony are crucial. Future generations will see the global pandemic as a turning point in history. However, it will be hard for them to imagine what this plight and struggle was like without objective on the ground photographic evidence.
Walking on a Blade is a revelatory journey into the unseen life, a window into the world of the voiceless by those that can have their voice heard. Our book is sure to leave a lasting impression on the reader, featuring powerful imagery and poignant personal accounts of life during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is also an intimate and introspective retelling of the day-to-day life of our esteemed members.

The photographic record of the 1918 ""Spanish Flu"" pandemic is lacking; period accounts are few and next to none. Even worse, there is hardly any visual evidence to corroborate that colossal incident in our not too distant past, partly due to the inaccessibility and technical barriers of the photographic medium and the fact that it coincided with the November 1918 armistice. 
Why does the suffering continue? Why are we not prepared for these sorts of calamities? Why must innocent people pay such a dearly price in this time of supposed ""enlightenment?"" These are essential questions in dire need of answers. Perhaps we should spend more time addressing these issues than focusing on material gain, commerce, personal riches and geopolitical affairs. After all, what is the point of existing if we cannot defeat a deadly, transmittable, yet curable virus? If we all die, who will reap the benefits? So many unanswered and unaddressed questions.     

Walking on a Blade: Life in the time of Coronavirus is the collective result of our revered photographers' hard and vigorous work. Our courageous members set their well-being and safety aside to document life as it has been since the onset of this devastating virus. Along with our associate, the Pulitzer Center, and support from dozens of professionals worldwide. Our book is the epitome of professional photojournalism in the 21st century. 
It is now 2021; we live in an era of unparalleled access to useful, objective, peer-reviewed information. Nevertheless, the casualty count keeps rising, and so does the number of infected. To make matters worse, new variants of the novel (new) Coronavirus disease keep emerging. What have we done wrong? How many more need to perish and suffer before we address this deadly respiratory disease efficiently and responsibly.

It has been 103 years since the ""Spanish Flu"" epidemic, yet we've done little to nothing to improve our response towards respiratory illnesses. Little to nothing to avoid this calamity. Covid-19 has destroyed countless lives because of stagnant and incompetent reactions by those entrusted with our wellbeing.
Even our global economy, robust and complicated as it may be, is now on its toes. Our pharmaceutical companies who pride themselves on bringing us cures for every ailment and discomfort struggle to deal with the reality that their patients will not die from cholesterol, heart failure, diabetes, depression, hypertension, STD's and cancer but Coronavirus.
Moreover, our logistical ingenuities, which span the globe, and are excellent at delivering commercial goods to our doorstep, are failing us during this distressful time. We don't need iPhones, Avocados, Cocoa beans or PlayStations; we need vaccines.
Walking on a Blade is a formidable visual indictment for those who needlessly suffer from oppression and geopolitical discrimination, as well as a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and collective will to surpass this dark point in our history. Hopefully, with this book, our progeny will do better and learn from our mistakes.

There is more than one perspective
What strikes one first when looking through the projects in the following pages, is the dignity and empathy with which people in these stories are portrayed. This is an anthology of people documenting their own society during an epoch-defining epidemic. There’s a sense of intimacy that comes from being part of the community, from understanding what to look for.

This is where we ask for your help! 
The quality and standards we hold for this book are high. We sought to create a small time capsule of ourselves so that later we might realize that aside from all the troubles and darkness, hope and the passion for living became our survival kit. A survival kit to assist humankind in overcoming these obstacles and a means of passing the torch of life to the next generation.
The costs needed for the final stages included editing, printing, and marketing. We have spent 12 months waist-deep in the creative process.
Our book represents something different, an anthology of unique voices that hold the power to cross into new territory and shift culture. All of this has made us realize that we are destined to publish our baby at the grassroots level!
So we are asking for help in raising $20,000 to independently publish and expose our book by the spring of 2021. We can no longer do this alone and would be sincerely humbled and grateful beyond measure for your contribution.

 
Local Stories With Global Impact
By supporting this campaign, Walking on a Blade: Life in the time of Coronavirus becomes your project. An opportunity for you to impact the lives of those who are grappling to cope with this devastating disease. It is also a means to assist the front-liners, courageous journalists, who put their well-being and fragile mental health aside to document the harshness faced by a marginalized and mostly ignored population. Furthermore, Walking on a Blade is an inclusive project featuring multi-disciplinary professionals working on a variety of content such as text, image, multimedia, and an original soundtrack. It is also a celebration of diversity, conceived and produced by 24 uniquely talented women and men, all of whom are people of color and have diverse backgrounds.  

A testament to a time when everything stood still. This book aims to depict the Coronavirus Pandemic as it unfolded and propagated throughout the world. 2020 was an unforgettable and tragic year that impacted millions. However, like many critical moments in human history, they are destined to be forgotten if not comprehensively documented. This book serves as proof for further generations to avoid our mistakes, and when, not if, a Pandemic occurs again, they shall be better prepared to deal with it. They will have irrefutable visual evidence showing just what happened and why.
Your contribution will help us raise awareness about the devastation caused by Coronavirus, unmute the muted, and save lives.

Far Beyond The Stereotypes
Against this generalizing sorting by mechanical eyes, the photographs published in this book remind us that the real Iran exists on the ground and show in a sophisticated, singular and individualized way, that human stories are only made possible due to two conditions: physical proximity and the eyes of Iranians themselves. This book meets this challenge with excellence.

Why Crowdsourcing
First, and probably most importantly, we want to keep the price of this book as low as possible, and that's the reason why we need you as our supporters. This project represents the power of community and togetherness, and we want as many people as possible to be a part of its making.
We have put a tremendous amount of trust into the higher purpose of this project, understanding that it is in service to something much greater than ourselves.  The first person we interviewed was back in January 2020, and since then over 30 people have entrusted their stories to the co-creation of this living, breathing vision. It is our great privilege to bring such a powerful collection out from the shadows, as an appeal that might ripple out into the world and create meaningful and profound change.  
In this unprecedented time in modern history, technology has given us the facility to reach many through the most straightforward and immediate means, the internet. With its many caveats, crowdsourcing is still to date the most efficient and prolific method of raising funds for trustworthy and legitimate purposes. We at NVP Images have selected the IndieGoGo platform for this sensitive task. Crowdsourcing has extended our broadcast, allowing us to reach as many people as possible so that they may help us achieve our goal. The contributions made to this fund will assist us in continuing our endeavor to document and distribute critical grassroots front-line journalism that gives the voiceless a chance to be seen and heard.

 
Other Ways You Can Help
Understandably, the financial situation is challenging at this time. But if sharing this campaign with your family, friends, relatives, and co-workers is all you can do, it is more than appreciated. Thank you for sharing the link.

The Passion of Life
Editor's note on the creation of Walking On A Blade
Since late March 2020, when we decided to go ahead with the coronavirus project at the agency, I had to develop a system to control our produced material as it was coming in from different places.
We had eight photographers in Iran, focusing on specific, narrow, and challenging subjects of Iranian society. Their task was to focus on the middle and lower classes of the nation, including daily workers who had to keep working despite the pandemic and the country’s lockdowns as there were no other alternatives for them.  This project is named ‘Walking On A Blade.’
Then we had one other visual storyteller based in Canada (like myself) and another in Norway, who worked on more personal and in-depth stories of the impact of the pandemic on their inner family circles. This project is named ‘Life in the time of Corona.’

Apart from those two projects, we had three other photojournalists in Iran, reporting on COVID-19 frontline-fighters. That project is called ‘Disinfecting Iran.’
In the middle of the preparation phase, the Pulitzer Center selected our first project as one of the COVID-19 projects to collaborate with and fund. The window for working without a timeline began to close, and I needed to stay on top of all the projects.
As a senior editor, I started to design digital contact sheets from the photo selection we had from every story we received from each photographer in Iran. Based on the time we had and the project's complexity, I had to write short notes or key points on the contact sheets to pinpoint and clarify some subtexts, mark a few as my first selections, and forward them to other editors either in Iran or Canada. They would then make their own selections, mark them with a different color, and send the sheets back to me. Afterwards, I would look to see which images had both marks: mine and the other editor’s. These selections were then added to the general pool for the project's pitch. 
While we were reaching out to publications and media outlets to introduce our project, we went through every single contact sheet again. We chose from the broader selection for each narrative for the purpose of solo presentation. Some projects had the potential to stand alone as their own story, while others were only good for collective work. 
By mid-May 2020, based on the produced material, the agency decided to create multimedia, as well as publish a book as another final product. After carefully reviewing our options, we hired a very talented musician and composer, Rouzbeh Esfandarmaz and his company PAMARO in the Netherlands, to conduct an original song for the multimedia segment. 

The second move was to choose a book designer and start the long journey of book publishing. After all the considerations and based on our long-standing work relations, the agency decided to collaborate with Kaveh Ashourinia, an artist with a creative and complex mind, from Toronto, Canada. His company, Beak Studio, started to plan and design the book while we were completing the projects. This was a challenging process for him as the project wasn't finished, and he and his team had to be flexible with us. We had weekly and then near-daily meetings, to help the book progress properly.  
As the project proceeded to the final section, our team was already all over the globe. Aside from our 14 photographers from 3 countries, we had one translator in California, USA, another two translators in Toronto, Canada, and a copy editor in Barcelona, Spain. This project is the final product of 28 dedicated souls from 12 cities, six countries, and three continents. Regardless of all the hardship and troubles of working in the quarantine amidst the coronavirus pandemic, they dedicated their time and love unconditionally to this project to portray substantial evidence of the unprecedented time and unique global crisis that future generations will look back to for years to come. 
‘Walking On A Blade’ is a small-time capsule of ourselves, so that later we might realize that aside from all the troubles and darkness of our time, hope and The Passion Of Life became the survival kit to assist humankind in overcoming the obstacles and passing the torch of life and living to the next generation.
Life is still beautiful.

Knolling Humanity
This book not only documents a series of stories, but also emphasizes individuals who are often overlooked and shows how their lives were affected by the pandemic. The book's core concept is not to reflect people's difficulties and sorrows during and after the pandemic. It tries to tell the story of life.

Risks
The project is well underway. We dedicated every second of our time planning, editing, proofing, and finally pre-printing the book during the past year. It was challenging to materialize and produce this anthology due to the many delays brought by the Coronavirus pandemic. It was equally demanding on our esteemed collaborators who risked their health and well-being to capture and document the contents of this book. In addition to that, we faced complexities and delays during the printing process.
Nevertheless, we are pleased to announce that the book is essentially ready, and our graphic designer Kaveh Nia, worked hard to have every page finished on time. Moreover, the beautifully designed artistic cover by Kaveh Nia is ready. After a year of intensive labor, our magnificent opus is complete. Thanks to our devoted team of tireless visual artists and professionals.
There are always factors outside of our control, printing problems, shipping delays, and unexpected glitches that may arise. We are confident that none of these potential issues will occur, but we live in a strange, tumultuous, and chaotic time. The Coronavirus pandemic might have an impact on shipping and logistics. If this were to happen, we would continuously keep our backers updated and immediately inform them of any changes or delays.",25.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p> </p></figure></div><p>Even though I’d been thinking of ways to bring film lighting to my phone, my ‘<span>aha</span>’ moment for <span>BIGSOFTI</span> didn’t come on set or even during a shoot.

<p> </p></figure></div><p>Throughout the process, Head Designer Andrew Simpson spoke about product design being a <span>'swinging pendulum'</span> between tech functionality and human interaction. Swing too far in one direction you lose the core practicality of the product, too far in the other direction and you lose the great user experience. We needed to make a product that was the perfect combination of both.</p><p>Initially, we created a light panel that would attach to the underside of a flip-out phone case. We found that while the function of the light module worked well, the user interaction with the design was lacking. We showed it to family, friends and colleagues who loved the effect of the lighting, but not the experience so we went back to the drawing board.</p><p> </p><div data-id=""29511412""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1595349998/b1ajxtrzhrabdhtx7gxg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p></figure></div><p>We explored fixed universal clips, magnetic blocks, locking rubber lugs, even a metal arm and shoe mount. We were split on the clip VS rubber lug and so decided to run some market research through the digital platform <span>OnePulse, </span>asking a focus group of 500 men and women 18-35, across the UK and US which design they preferred. A resounding eighty-five per cent said the clip-on design.</p><p> </p><div data-id=""29511571""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1595349998/nl4sbqnppr2jwhsiutoe.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p></figure></div><p>Our direction became very clear.

<p> </p></figure></div><p>We had our design, now we needed to get it made.

Hunter had an answer to all our questions and within a few days had sent us itemised quotes with unit numbers, costs, recommendations and timelines.</p><p> </p><div data-id=""29511925""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1595350000/mlzg6x859pxksizptb3g.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p></figure></div><p>With Hunter’s input we were able to improve the lighting board and PCB layout, update the charge port to USB-C and increase the battery size and run time.  But most importantly, we were able to update the quality of our LEDs.</p><p>We are now working with specialised, photography grade BI-COLOUR LEDs, so new that they may have never been used in a device this small before. They deliver changeable colour temperature functionality - with options for all scenarios - <span>DAYLIGHT</span> (5500K), <span>TUNGSTEN</span> (3000K) and a <span>CLEAN MIX</span> (4000K)<span>.</span> Which means awesome colour reproduction for better images.

<p>An enormous thank you to everyone who turned out over July to back us on Kickstarter - the response so far has been incredible.  But we also couldn't have got where we are today, without lots of help from family and friends. This whole thing has been done as lean as possible. From learning how to build a website, to hassling my poor friends to be in the videos. Harassing my brother Matt to help me film things. To asking my wife Jan for feedback during scripting. And a couple of favours finishing the content with Chris at <span>White Chocolate</span> in Darlington, and Tone at <span>Rumble Studios</span> in Chippendale. So to all those people - a huge thanks. Literally could not have done it without you all.</p></figure></div><p> </p><div data-caption=""Chief Technology Cat analysing LED spectrum lab reports. LOL - No he's not.

 On a film set, when lighting for beauty shots,  cinematographers use the biggest, softest lights we have, to make actors and models look their best. Why? A big light wraps gently around features on the face, and a soft light evens out skin tone and diffuses any hard shadows - so bumps and creases disappear. Created by Australian film professionals and based on these lighting principles, BIGSOFTI is a mobile, high quality, bi-colour LED soft panel that delivers stunning diffused lighting for better photos, videos and video calls on all your devices.
 
Universal clip fits all leading smartphone, tablet and laptop brands.
Shoe mount with 1/4""-20 thread fits all cameras, tripods and light stands.

 BIGSOFTI has been designed for maximum big-ness but to still to have a footprint smaller than your mobile. Size compared here to the regular iPhone X.  BIGSOFTI is super lightweight at just 74g / 2.6 oz. For reference the iPhone X weighs 167g / 5.9 oz. Whether for a night out with friends or off to a shoot with a client, BIGSOFTI is easy to transport. Super compact, super lightweight and super bright. 
 The battery on our prototypes was 1000mAh.  In testing we have measured run times at approx:95 mins at MAX | 140 mins at MID | 240 mins at LOW. And full charge from flat is around 2 hrs. *Subject to battery age and weather conditions. But with our stretch goals achieved, we can upgrade the size of this battery by 1.5X to a 1500mAh battery - which will increase these timings.USB-C allows for operation while charging, so if a need ever arises the unit can be run from a power source.As we are injection moulding the diffusion panel, we will have full control of elements that effect the panel opacity (we'll be experimenting with the mix of composite ingredients / diffusing powders that give a glow effect etc). Once we have the tooling complete and can experiment with these options, fine tuning will take place to balance the LED outputs VS the diffusion opacity. As a result run times may vary up or down slightly in final production model. 
 While CRI is a commonly cited score, as a film professional, a more important rating is the Television Lighting Consistency Index or TLCI.  It also runs from 0-100.  Our LED rating of 98+ puts us in the range where any colour variation is so small, a film colourist would not consider correcting it.   
 
 We've been hard at work over the past three weeks confirming the final details of our tooling setup - we have paid and signed our contract and have been working on the finer points of the design, with tool cutting due to commence any day. We have opted to work with a higher precision tooling company as it will both allow us to produce more units faster, and also deliver a product with a higher quality finish.  We're also excited to announce that since we can now order at higher volume, we have been able to negotiate some rates and add a couple of pretty cool features that will now be shipped with every BIGSOFTI.And after hitting our $650K Stretch Goal - every single BIGSOFTI shipped to every backer will now have a 1500mAh battery!   
 Grab a single BIGSOFTI for perfect front lit photos and video direct from your mobile, tablet, laptop or camera. The diffused lighting from our photography grade, bi-colour LEDs will help you create more professional looking content quickly and easily.   Multipack Perks below all come with 3 x Accessories per light module as standard.
 Get a two pack for a 'two-light setup' - the standard for most simple filming situations.Key light: The key light is the strongest, providing most of the light in the shot. It’s generally placed in front of your subject, around 45-degrees above and 45-degrees to the right or left.  You can use BIGSOFTI at a higher setting for your key light.Fill light: This is a lower intensity light, used to fill in shadows on the subject’s face. It should be positioned to the side opposite the key light. You can use BIGSOFTI at a lower setting for your fill light.    And if you want to look even better you add a third light . . . Follow the two-light setup above, but also position your third light behind your subject facing back towards the camera. This backlight or hair-light throws a lovely rim of light to help separate your subject from your background for added depth to the image - making your content look more professional.   
 
 My name is Al Morrow, I'm a Sydney-based TV commercial director who’s worked with global brands in both Australia and the US for over a decade.  I'm the guy who walks into a room and has to fight the urge to adjust the lights. Lighting quality literally affects how we see the world, and yet so many people hardly give it enough thought. 
Al Morrow lining up the frame on recent Volkswagen TV Commercial.
 I know how important lighting is when filming, well, anything and because I shoot photos and videos on my phone all the time, I wanted to bring the same kind of high-quality light that I use on my film sets to my mobile. 
 
 
 Even though I’d been thinking of ways to bring film lighting to my phone, my ‘aha’ moment for BIGSOFTI didn’t come on set or even during a shoot. It came one day in the car. My wife was driving and her sister was in the backseat; taking selfie after selfie. She was holding up a jacket to cut out the direct sunlight and complaining that her photos either had too many hard shadows or were being blasted by the phone flash.I commented to her, that without her knowing it, she was cutting and shaping light in a similar way that we would on a film set and that if she wanted full control of her image, she’d need to have a small, powerful, soft light with her. Her face lit up (no pun intended) 'that would be great!'. Many months later, she was the first person we started our tests on, comparing our soft light to the hard light of the phone flash. 
Note the harsh light and hard focussed shadow from the single point LED on the phone (top left) VS much softer spread from BIGSOFTI (top right).
 That was when I realised this was not just a product I would use. Everyone (director or not), uses cameras and anyone shooting photos or videos needs good light.The first thing I did when I got home that evening was to look at what products already existed in this space. There were phone cases that seemed cumbersome. Products that were made with cheap, low-quality LEDs. Lighting attachments that were too big, too heavy, too expensive.There seemed to be a gap in the market! I was curious to see if we could address these design flaws and make something better - and the BIGSOFTI journey began. 
 BIGSOFTI began with me in my office pulling apart LED products I bought on ebay and hacking bits together but it really shifted gear when I brought on the team at Vert Design.  
 I was impressed by both their enthusiasm and their experience (they had designed products for clients such as SONY, INTEL, BMW and DEUS among others) and, from the outset, our partnership was a perfect combination of my knowledge of lighting and photography and their passion for user-focused design.We set off on two things: 1. Start on initial designs. 2. Find the right manufacturing partner. 
 Throughout the process, Head Designer Andrew Simpson spoke about product design being a 'swinging pendulum' between tech functionality and human interaction. Swing too far in one direction you lose the core practicality of the product, too far in the other direction and you lose the great user experience. We needed to make a product that was the perfect combination of both.Initially, we created a light panel that would attach to the underside of a flip-out phone case. We found that while the function of the light module worked well, the user interaction with the design was lacking. We showed it to family, friends and colleagues who loved the effect of the lighting, but not the experience so we went back to the drawing board. 
 We explored fixed universal clips, magnetic blocks, locking rubber lugs, even a metal arm and shoe mount. We were split on the clip VS rubber lug and so decided to run some market research through the digital platform OnePulse, asking a focus group of 500 men and women 18-35, across the UK and US which design they preferred. A resounding eighty-five per cent said the clip-on design. 
 Our direction became very clear. Several iterations later, we now have a rotating, removable mechanism (patent pending), which houses a universal clip for all leading smartphone, tablet and laptop brands. Plus the additional features of a cold shoe camera mount with ¼” 20 thread mount and the 3M Adhesive Mount for general surfaces. It’s this simple versatility that helps put BIGSOFTI into its own category - being effortlessly transferrable across all your devices.  
 We had our design, now we needed to get it made. After a false start with our initial manufacturer (bad communication, high costs, lack of knowledge and lack of passion about the product) we were put in touch with a man named Hunter Ho; an LED lighting product specialist.During our first meeting with Hunter, we discussed the technical requirements of LED numbers, size, spacing and distance, colour temp,  CRI and TLCI ratings, the diffusing materials, batteries and charge times, circuits and regulatory approval checks. Hunter had an answer to all our questions and within a few days had sent us itemised quotes with unit numbers, costs, recommendations and timelines. 
 With Hunter’s input we were able to improve the lighting board and PCB layout, update the charge port to USB-C and increase the battery size and run time.  But most importantly, we were able to update the quality of our LEDs.We are now working with specialised, photography grade BI-COLOUR LEDs, so new that they may have never been used in a device this small before. They deliver changeable colour temperature functionality - with options for all scenarios - DAYLIGHT (5500K), TUNGSTEN (3000K) and a CLEAN MIX (4000K). Which means awesome colour reproduction for better images. We are super confident in our design and just as confident in our manufacturer.  
 Now that we had our product designed, user tested and refined - it was time to get to watch it in action out in the real world. I roped in some folks to have a play and my very generous brother Matt came along and filmed BIGSOFTI ... being used for selfies, on top of a camera gimbal, taking photos of food, for FaceTime video in the back of an Uber and zoom video conferencing at home on the laptop. This is what we made.

</div></div>","Every year we add even more amazing Goddesses to our ranks and it gets harder and harder to figure out how to include as many as possible in the calendar campaign.  Last year our Goddesses sported lingerie and mixed it with cheesecake pinup and this year we wanted to bring you the best of the best in images and also include both Goddesses you already love and brand new ones for you to meet. You know that that means, a new year, A NEW THEME!These year's theme is a true classic: SWIMSUITS.  Each of our participating Goddesses is in the works creating an image that best utilizes characters you love in swimsuits matching that characters look and personality as well as recreating accurate looks from series you enjoy that continue to represent the character, only sexier! As Yoda would say ""An Excellent Calendar, this will be!""This year's calendar will feature images from  Alora Jaymes, Prisma Bunny, Bear, Brittnie Jade, Jessica Nova, Maygin, Faylin, Vonka, Wicked Lady, Nurse Harley, Erisaka, Lily Rose, Minnie D'Moocha, Essi, Lady Toxica, and Rockabilly Roxie!With Additional Prints and Portraits created by: Alice Malice, Kathtea, Holy Cherries, Margarette Ghost, Val Valkyrie, and Xeno Frell.Below you'll find an early submission  ready for viewing from the always awesome Lady Toxica.  This is a preview and the final image may vary.  The 2019 Calendar will be a standard 12 month calendar with a centerfold and an additional unique image on both the front and back calendar.  Despite this, we have 22 Goddesses participating in the Calendar Campaign. That means you have all those options to choose from as well as additional images created by even more goddesses. Each of these lovely ladies have worked their buns off in the early winter months to create these fun swimsuit clad images.  Each of these images will  be offered as prints for purchase (either through one of our campaign perks or afterwards).   Our Goal includes the cost of paying models, photographers, photo editors and getting the calendars printed.  Why so much you might ask?

<h3>About the Project</h3>
<p>Earlier this summer, I had bilateral strabismus surgery. Ever since birth, I’ve had a slightly farsighted left eye and a significantly nearsighted right eye, and in short, my brain never fused these competing images into one 3D image. So instead, my brain just takes the input from the dominant eye and suppresses the other. When I try and force my eyes to work together, the result is a chaotic, headache-inducing effect of double vision without clear focus. </p>
<p>A couple days after the aforementioned surgery, I was robbed in broad daylight on a bus while bystanders laughed. I had an epiphany, however, in the moments following the robbery. I realized that I need to be true to my vision as a photographer, both figuratively and literally, and use it to share my own story. Enter <i>Seeing Double</i>. </p>
<p>In my debut experimental photography book <i>Seeing Double</i>, I will step out of the photo pit to convey the nature of what and how I see using multiple exposure photography in 35mm, while holding an unflinching mirror to the world, and that’s just the first section. <i>Seeing Double</i> will use the sandbox of multiple exposure film photography to explore additional themes and even peek beyond the cosmic membrane, all starring a cast of the creatives who’ve inspired me and my work. And to all my Instagram followers, yes, there will be a section of live concert photos! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Film photography isn’t cheap, and neither is self-publishing a limited run of photography books. Even a run of 25 copies would cost nearly a grand after shipping and tax, and that’s not including the cost of film, development and scanning. With your support, I can make this happen. </p>
<p>I don’t want to take something for nothing, so I am offering prints and other goodies at various price levels, as well as special rates on my services as a photographer. Rewards include signed and numbered copies of <i>Seeing Double</i>, portrait sessions, prints, limited edition sets of exclusive images, postcards and more. </p>
<p><i>Seeing Double</i> will be an  11x8.5 inch photography book with an estimated 100-120 pages consisting of experimental portraits, concert photos and more. In the event of overfunding, it will feature additional pages and possibly even more photo series. If the campaign reaches over $5,000, I will also have a gallery show for my work. </p>
<p>All backers that pledge $5 or more will be formally thanked in<i> Seeing Double’s</i> acknowledgement section.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Ever since I got into music journalism, my longterm goal was to one day publish a book, except now I’ve switched from the written word to photography. Between the recent robbery and an extended cancer scare throughout most of 2018, I’ve been confronted with my own mortality and the prospect of going unfulfilled. </p>
<p>Publishing <i>Seeing Double </i>is how I take ownership of my condition to make something special and  instill a sense of tangibility to my work. </p>
<p>With <i>Seeing Double</i>, I want to do more than just get my truth out there. Ideally, it would bring more attention to a condition that’s ignored in public discourse and especially the media. But really, as long as it gives my contributors something that makes them think and feel something new, I’ll be satisfied. </p>

I realized that I need to be true to my vision as a photographer, both figuratively and literally, and use it to share my own story. Enter Seeing Double. 
In my debut experimental photography book Seeing Double, I will step out of the photo pit to convey the nature of what and how I see using multiple exposure photography in 35mm, while holding an unflinching mirror to the world, and that’s just the first section. Seeing Double will use the sandbox of multiple exposure film photography to explore additional themes and even peek beyond the cosmic membrane, all starring a cast of the creatives who’ve inspired me and my work. And to all my Instagram followers, yes, there will be a section of live concert photos! 

What We Need & What You Get
Film photography isn’t cheap, and neither is self-publishing a limited run of photography books. Even a run of 25 copies would cost nearly a grand after shipping and tax, and that’s not including the cost of film, development and scanning. With your support, I can make this happen. 
I don’t want to take something for nothing, so I am offering prints and other goodies at various price levels, as well as special rates on my services as a photographer. Rewards include signed and numbered copies of Seeing Double, portrait sessions, prints, limited edition sets of exclusive images, postcards and more. 
Seeing Double will be an  11x8.5 inch photography book with an estimated 100-120 pages consisting of experimental portraits, concert photos and more. In the event of overfunding, it will feature additional pages and possibly even more photo series. If the campaign reaches over $5,000, I will also have a gallery show for my work. 
All backers that pledge $5 or more will be formally thanked in Seeing Double’s acknowledgement section.  

The Impact
Ever since I got into music journalism, my longterm goal was to one day publish a book, except now I’ve switched from the written word to photography. Between the recent robbery and an extended cancer scare throughout most of 2018, I’ve been confronted with my own mortality and the prospect of going unfulfilled. 
Publishing Seeing Double is how I take ownership of my condition to make something special and  instill a sense of tangibility to my work. 
With Seeing Double, I want to do more than just get my truth out there. Ideally, it would bring more attention to a condition that’s ignored in public discourse and especially the media. But really, as long as it gives my contributors something that makes them think and feel something new, I’ll be satisfied.

<h3>Silberra Films: About Us</h3>
<p>Since 2009 we've been manufacturing supplies for analog photography. We started it in our own lab, relying on the recipes we managed to acquire from different sources: encyclopedias, chemistry books, photographic guidebooks and many others. We've been studying chemistry, reinventing the solutions, trying to bring back the variety of the developers and auxiliary solutions from the times when analog photography flourished. </p>
<p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505775990/famqpqyrbzvwfpwvr8fh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We've passed a long way from small home-based lab to small-scale chemistry manufacture. This year we've decided that our products deserve their own brand name, and we gave birth to ""Silberra"" trade mark. This trade mark shall be the brand name for our films also and you can find a lot about the whole product range at our web-site: <a href=""https://www.silberra.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.silberra.com</a> .</p>
<p>Feel free to surf our Instagram  account also: <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/silberrafilm/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.instagram.com/silberrafilm/</a> . You'll find a lot of film shots made on Silberra film by photographers from all over the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now we have 3 versions of Silberra PAN films (ISO160, ISO100 and ISO50) plus limited edition of Silberra PAN200 and Silberra Ultima200 (ISO200), which are black&amp;white negative panchromatic films based on modified Agfa emulsions. We're ready to offer those in 35mm format, and we're working hard to start the production of 120 type.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to start mass market manufacturing of Silberra film to make it available worldwide. </p>
<p>1) We need to make small semi-automated packaging line (or to subcontract one) to produce enough films to meet your demand (and we shall do it fast, for you not to spend years in waiting). <br/>2) We need to place order for corresponding amount of the beautiful cardboard boxes for Silberra film and it means that we need to buy it in wholesale quantity.<br/>3) To start mass market manufacturing of ORTA film we need to buy substrate with all the properties that will suit us: anti halation layer, anti curling layer, and substrate shall be thin enough and yet reliable.<br/>4) To run 120 Type manufacturing for all the films we need either to contract third-party manufacturing line or to create small semi-automated manufacturing line of our own;<br/>5) We need R&amp;D funds to go on with PANII (panchrome) emulsion and IC (isochrome) emulsion engineering. Every job must be paid, and scientific one shall be paid well.</p>
<p>Shall we succeed in acquiring the whole sum we're up to, we'll have really good ground for a start. Please keep in mind that backing us here you're not buying the rewards (film shall be much lower in price when mass manufacturing starts); you're backing us on running new film, new photo papers and new chemicals. And we won't disappoint you, folks.</p>
<p>As for rewards - we have a lot of them for you to choose. You can choose as much perks as you like; should you like to get several perks, all you need to do is to order the perks one at a time, that's it.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>One more place where new films are manufactured, that's what we'd like to implement with the help of that campaign. There are not too much photo films these days. Each new film which comes to the market is like new paint for painters: imagine that you've been limited to use just 5 or 6 colors through the whole life, and suddenly you have an option to use one more! Well, we've brought you a kind of color palette at once. <br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>When you produce something new there are always risks and challenges. But we're sure that we'll overcome every challenge we have on our way. We've done too much to stop when facing any difficulty: there is no such option for us.</p>
<p>We have to engineer a lot in technics and emulsions too. But the only risk here is that we'll have to spend a bit more time solving the problem, than we're expecting. But we've got used to work fast, so the main thing for us is your faith and support: when one knows his efforts are not in vain, there are no obstacles in his way.<br/> </p>
<h3>What for do we need money exactly? </h3>
<p>Here is the budgeting picture explaining the costs. As you see, we're placing a lot of the funds into perks manufacturing, as it will allow us to pre-order a lot of the components we need for full-scale manufacturing. While the first perks delivered at December 2017 are going to be hand rolled, the rest of the rewards shall be manufactured at the semi-automated or automated manufacturing line. Depending on the amount of the funds we will be able to acquire, we're going to construct it anew or subcontract one at the existing film manufacturing facilities. </p>

It's a fun process of collecting photos, creating stories, conducting interviews and highlighting local talent. The best part is printing and distributing the finished tangible product to our readers.
