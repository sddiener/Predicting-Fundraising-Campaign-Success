<p><b><i>A Taste Dinner - Reheat and Relax</i></b></p>
<p>Taste answers 
the age-old question “What’s for dinner?” in a new and exciting way. I 
create inventive recipes based on seasonal ingredients. The menu changes
 weekly and always includes gluten-free and vegetarian options.  All 
dinners are fully cooked - all you have to do is reheat and relax. </p>
<p>I
 do all of the cooking in the back-of-the-house, and serve as the face 
of the company in the front-of-the-house, establishing personal 
relationships with all of my customers so they come to think of me as 
their “personal chef.""</p>
<p>Taste by Katie is perfect for when:</p>
<p>- There's no time to go to the market</p>
<p>- You don't have time to cook</p>
<p>- You want a meal prepared to meet your needs</p>
<p>- You're tired of eating typical fast food</p>
<p>Taste by Katie makes your ""rush-hour"" a thing of the past!</p>
<p>After
 a year of steady growth, it's time to expand. I have made due with 
broken ovens, finicky refrigerators and a freezer on the fritz. <i>What?! No more ice cream?!?! </i>For
 the past year, I have been the executive chef, sous chef, and line cook
 (with a little help from my family). The website needs improved 
functionality, and increased outreach to the community will greatly 
increase sales. With your help, I'll be able to buy new equipment, hire 
an assistant, and increase my marketing efforts.</p>
<p><b><i>True Stories from Taste:</i></b></p>
<p><b>Something to Crow About</b>
 -- It is 7:00 on a cold January night and my phone rings. One of my 
best customers has just finished dinner and is calling to tell me the 
Chicken Pot Pie he had for dinner “is awesome.” The Chicken Pot Pie is 
made with roasted chicken breast, carrots and peas in a savory gravy and
 topped with a biscuit crust.  I immediately send an email to my 
customers about the positive feedback. I am sold out of Chicken Pot Pie 
by the next day.</p>
<p><b>Taste Wins 1st Prize in Chili Cook-off</b> -- 
In 2014, I participated in a Chili Cook-off that has become a Labor Day 
tradition in Arlington, VA. Having never participated in a cook-off 
before and since Taste had only been open for four months, I thought the
 publicity would be good. Labor Day was forecast to be hot and humid, so
 I created a chili to demonstrate my inventive style of cooking, 
balancing hot and cold ingredients. The result, ""East Meets West Chili,""
 ground pork infused with Asian spices and topped with a 
broccoli-pineapple slaw, hoisin sour cream and crispy noodles. A winning
 recipe.</p>
<p><b>Vegan Valentine's 911</b> -- On February 13, I got a 
call from a customer looking for a special dinner for Valentine's Day. 
She explained that her husband is vegan and it's very hard to find 
delicious recipes that meet his needs. ""Could you come up with a dinner 
for us for tomorrow?"" she asked. ""No problem,"" I said. On Valentine's 
Day she had braised beef short ribs and he had Coconut Curry with 
zucchini. They LOVED it.</p>
<p><b><i>The Goal:</i></b></p>
<p>Taste wants to raise $30,000 to purchase new equipment, hire an assistant, and expand marketing efforts. </p>
<p>Since
 one great chef can only create so much delicious food in a finite 
amount of time, increased storage capacity, better equipment, and a 
well-trained assistant will help meet the growing desire for Taste's 
wide range of appetizers, dinners and desserts. In addition, expanded 
marketing efforts will help spread the word about Taste's unique brand 
of restaurant-quality food that is ready to eat at home in 30 minutes or
 less.</p>
<b><i>Risks and Challenges:</i></b><br/>
</div>I have overcome several hurdles in getting Taste off the ground. A year-long search to find the perfect space, managing the various permits required to launch a food-service company, and buying affordable equipment, were just some of the challenges I met.<br/><div>
<br/>In the competitive Washington, DC dining market, Taste's biggest challenge is getting foodies in the door with so many other corporate-backed options in the area. Being a small business in big city and making a name for yourself is tough!<br/><br/>The biggest challenge will be to balance the marketing and staffing to continue to grow at a sustainable rate. My recipe for success is having the right amount of marketing and staff to keep the business cooking all week.<br/><br/><br/>

<p>Camp
SNAP (Silly Nerdy Activities Playground) is bringing<i> hot and iced</i> coffee, tea, and water for 
burners of all ages. It is our hope that they will enjoy their drinks while socializing together over games of all sizes. We will have a public shaded Cafe and a larger public shade Game Lounge. We are trying to bring games (board to over sized) and build great fun games, see example below:</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434123839/xyy9byhpeuxhfulo7v2a.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We plan to keep the caf<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">e open every morning Monday through Sunday from 10am-1pm. We want everyone in Burning Man to start off on the right foot, and to reconnect over a game. </span></p>

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span><p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Does SNAP sound like something you can support? Please do! Have a question? Email us at </span><a href=""mailto:campsnap@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">campsnap@gmail.com</a><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">. You should also scroll down to check out the various perks available.  </span></p>
<p><b>Want to know more?</b></p>
<p>We currently have everything (scaffolding, cafe equipment, games, decor, and more) stored just outside of Reno. In order to bring all the infrastructure for the Cafe and Game Lounge, we need to rent a huge truck to move it. <br/></p>
<p>We hope to set up a really chill spot. The game lounge will have tons of seating in a shaded
structure for the public and stay open during all the
daylight hours. We are trying to get a generator to make the game space available 24 hours to
the Playa. Can you help us get our chill camp below to the Playa?</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432400750/aavca4ghsrhg9pwis7fv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p><b>What we are asking for: </b>
</p>
<p>We need $2,500 for the truck (20', 11 days, +miles). We are just asking for help with the truck, We would love to have a stretch goal of $3,650. This would be $650 for a generator (power, lights, keep the game area open 24/7) and $500 as wiggle emergency money… but that is an extreme wish.<br/></p>
<p><b>The
Impact</b></p>
<p>Let’s
face it, no one is himself or herself until they have their morning brew, and
that can be hard to find sometimes. We want to help make the Playa easier, while
providing games to socialize over. Do you think we have enough coffee?</p>

</div></div>","Support Camp SNAP!
Camp
SNAP (Silly Nerdy Activities Playground) is bringing hot and iced coffee, tea, and water for 
burners of all ages. It is our hope that they will enjoy their drinks while socializing together over games of all sizes. We will have a public shaded Cafe and a larger public shade Game Lounge. We are trying to bring games (board to over sized) and build great fun games, see example below:


We plan to keep the cafe open every morning Monday through Sunday from 10am-1pm. We want everyone in Burning Man to start off on the right foot, and to reconnect over a game. 



Does SNAP sound like something you can support? Please do! Have a question? Email us at campsnap@gmail.com. You should also scroll down to check out the various perks available.  
Want to know more?
We currently have everything (scaffolding, cafe equipment, games, decor, and more) stored just outside of Reno. In order to bring all the infrastructure for the Cafe and Game Lounge, we need to rent a huge truck to move it. 
We hope to set up a really chill spot. The game lounge will have tons of seating in a shaded
structure for the public and stay open during all the
daylight hours. We are trying to get a generator to make the game space available 24 hours to
the Playa. Can you help us get our chill camp below to the Playa?


What we are asking for: 

We need $2,500 for the truck (20', 11 days, +miles). We are just asking for help with the truck, We would love to have a stretch goal of $3,650. This would be $650 for a generator (power, lights, keep the game area open 24/7) and $500 as wiggle emergency money… but that is an extreme wish.
The
Impact
Let’s
face it, no one is himself or herself until they have their morning brew, and
that can be hard to find sometimes. We want to help make the Playa easier, while
providing games to socialize over. Do you think we have enough coffee?


Other
Ways You Can Help
There
are other ways to help that are not monetary, you can share this campaign or donations of
needed items like: French Presses, teapots, and manual coffee drips. You can join us at a fundraiser if in the SF Bay area! Email us at campsnap@gmail.com or go to www.campsnap.wix.com/snap to see how you can help. 
Check out the Perks:



 
Above are neck shades, they come in simple colors and patterns. Note the simple colors have either the SNAP logo or our modified Man. Below are the arrowhead necklaces.
 
These are a few shots and examples of the necklaces. The colors are: white, light brown marble, reddish orange, green, light colored marble, dark brown, dark brown marble, and black.
 

Below are shark teeth necklaces, there are single tooth necklaces and necklaces with three teeth.

Below are butterfly earrings, some we have two pairs of and others the larger ones are single pairs. Don't worry, all butterflies lived out their full lives and were not killed in order to make jewelry and adorn your ears. Our inner tree hugger would not allow it, note they have been laminated and thus are sturdy.

</div></div>","We have a passion for great local ingredients and believe that food can be a vehicle to promote positive change.


We believe that food sparks conversations, breaks the ice and brings people closer together, so why not start with local, affordable and nutrient rich ingredients. We are dedicated to providing 100% local and affordable goods and produce to members of our community and restaurants. 
We will have an ordering cart on our website that will enable individuals and restaurants to login, view, and place orders for food that will be available in the coming week.

What We Need & What You Get
 Cost Breakdown:



10-15k used extended cargo van or small truck for pickups from farms and deliveries to restaurants and elderly or handicap customers. We need a reliable vehicle that is clean, always starts, and lets us get the deliveries where they need to go on time.
30-40k to renovate the space. Kitchen with enough workspace to hold cooking classes. Education centre. 
~7k for commercial fridge, freezer, stoves, and dishwasher (will also be used to sterilize bottles)
3.5k for website development
If we raise money that goes beyond what we need to get up and running we will channel that money directly into our educational programs which will allow all the fun learning to start sooner.  

The Impact
 There is a global need for environmentally friendly and sustainable solutions for industry and agriculture alike. With an ever growing number of hungry bellies to fill, it is of increasing importance that we adopt a new mindset regarding the ways we think about food. By making some simple changes to our food related behaviours at the community level, it is possible and relatively easy to minimize the environmental strain that results from us having food.
Seek out and choose locally grown food whenever possible
Eliminate unecessary packaging
Educate children about food, where it comes from, the effort involved in producing it, and help them to realize its value beyond dollars
Teach families how to preserve food (can/pickle/dry)
Help families learn to cook and plan meals
Make it fun!
The key to initiating this type of change is to have facilities that make these services available and to let people know they are there. This is where you come in! 
We do need financial contributions to make River Jack's Local a reality, but that is not the only way you can help. We are always looking for more local famers to purchase from and/or participate in our programs, as well as chefs to lead our cooking courses, and we would be delighted to receive used industrial kitchen appliances/supplies.

No matter how you contribute, you will be making an impact and helping to affect positive change.  Risks and Challenges
As with all renovations that have a modest budget, finishing on or under budget will require some creativity and innovation. We intend to use inexpensive materials that meet our needs and will happily repurpose and/or reuse second hand items, gathered from auctions, establishments that are closing down, and local classifieds. 
We also intend to apply for government grants to give our project a little bit of a financial buffer and will also apply for a loan in order to complete the project even if we are unable to meet our campaign goals.

This UNIQUE KIWI ALE uses a novel iconic New Zealand ingredient called MANUKA to flavour Ale. 
It's delicious to drink. It's KIWI AS.  And yes, it's another GROUNDBREAKING KIWI INNOVATION. This is Ale like no other. These ARE NOT like Captain Cook's, Mussel Inn-Captain Cooker, or Wigram Spruce Beer clones.The faintest hint of wild honey and manuka flower gives it a refreshing tangy character. Really interesting. Yvonne Lorkin - NZ Wine and Beer Critic.My Manuka Ales are completely different, in flavour, feel, aroma, ingredients, and brewing. This is why I have Letter's Patent awarded from the Patent Office.Manuka Magic-it's a beauty unique Kiwi Ale is the newest on New Zealand's Beer Landscape, and it's coming to a Licensed Bar, Pub or Bottle Store near you, FOR YOU. EVALUATE THEM FOR YOURSELF with a 'Pre order'. Our Perks are unique, and delicious to drink. This invention gives hope for Beer Drinkers, as it answers a disturbing trend with Hops, the traditional flavouring in beer.The SecretAnd here is its biggest secret asset, which will make all ale and beer drinkers everywhere very, very happy: 
Hops will be hit very hard by climate change, because they cannot tolerate heat, which stresses the plant, and they are already suffering.  
Manuka however, thrives in these harsher growing conditions, and so Manuka Ales can be an answer to All Beer Drinker's worst fears (expensive low beer production).
The effects of climate change will reduce beer production worldwide, due to lost hop quality and production.
Manuka is a delicious alternative ingredient to hops in beer, and have the ability to supplement this pending loss.



Can humans survive on reduced beer production?
Agricultural and Forest Meteorology.
Volume 149, issues 6-7, 15 June 2009. Pages 913-919. 
THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE YIELD AND QUALITY OF SAAZ HOPS IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC.
The impact of climate change on the production and quality of hops Humulus lupulus will depend on future weather conditions in the growing season. Our simulations suggest that hops will be particularly vulnerable to a change in climate. Even with the modest warming so far experienced yields have stagnated and quality declined. Recorded observations show an increase in air temperature which is associated with an earlier onset of hop phenological phases and a shortening of the vegetation period.
With prices high and breweries booming, hop growers should be full of good cheer. Instead, they have furrowed brows as climate change threatens the finicky crop.
This is not a problem that’s going to happen someday. 
If you drink beer now, the issue of climate change is impacting you right now.

Hello, I'm Tony Dapson, Brewer and Owner of Naturale ™, a Brewing Brand from Napier, HAWKE'S BAY, NEW ZEALAND, on the East Coast of the North Island. 
Iv'e brewed Ales and Beers for 40 years, so I know good Beer and how to brew it.
In  1996, I invented a process of brewing with a novel ingredient using a small iconic tree found only in New Zealand. MANUKA- Leptospemum scoparium.
In 1999, I was awarded Letters Patent in New Zealand and Australia, with others pending for this invention.
This invention was born in Napier, Hawke's Bay, and is proudly MADE IN NEW ZEALAND.  A first rate food producing region of the World.
................................................................................................................................
This is Not Just Any Ale!
These Manuka Ales are a Historical Development in Beer Evolution. I believe them to be a NEW BRANCH on the Beer Tree, much like Lagers form part of it. 
You can be part of this HISTORIC EVOLUTION, by supporting Manuka Ales.

Your good will IS APPRECIATED, however it will not allow us to brew this ale.

Manuka Tree.

What is MANUKA?

Manuka is a small scruffy tree / shrub, which is found on only in New Zealand. It's the first plant to regenerate in open ground, and allows other plants to establish. 

It's like a nugget toughing it out in it's environment, and so can tolerate extreme conditions. 
.............................................................................................................................................


Endorsements. 
Brewer's Statement.
It is the culmination of years of experimental work, by trail and error, to bring Manuka Ales to this point. Development is on-going.
How do I convey the 'taste' of Manuka Magic Ale!
It's a complex explosion of very subtle flavours interacting with each other, infusing on your tongue.
Your first sip tells it all. You'll then understand why I've called it MAGIC. 

I stand by all the endorsements made below. They are from a cross section of society, and all walks of life.

The Magic of Manuka
Tony Dapson has created a smooth ale with an interesting herbal anise-edge. It's his most popular brew, and it's easy to see why.
The faintest hint of wild honey and manuka flower gives it a refreshing tangy character. Really interesting. 
Yvonne Lorkin - NZ Wine and Beer Critic. May 17th 2014. Indulge Magazine.
.........................................
We had Manuka Magic Ale on the guest tap a couple of times. The locals really took to it, and with rave revues. We were happy it went very well.

What are FUTURE'S VOUCHERS?

They are for 14 people grouping together to Pre-order Ale in a 30 Litre Keg giving each person 2 Litres of Ale each. (+20 Years Of Age ID Required).


THE FIRST OFFERING will be the freshest, cheapest and most direct way to offer ale to you, in 30 Litre Kegs delivered to a Licensed Liquor Establishment you nominate for delivery. 
For simplicity of operation, it's preferable for you to gather another 13 of your Friends, or Club Members together (over 20 years of age), and each contribute to a Group Voucher.  Everyone owns 2 Litres of Ale in a 30 Litre Keg.  The two litres on top is a gift, as tastings, spillage etc. 
Fill your 2 Litres in your own Flagon or Growler for home consumption, or enjoy Manuka Magic in your Licensed Club, (as an example). Then return the empty keg to us for refilling.
It's fun to share the experience in your Group setting with your mates.

Your nominated Licensed Liquor Establishment will supervise pouring. They may charge you a pouring fee, or sell you your Growler/Flagon. This is fair and to be expected.
You maybe a member of your local RSA, or Service, or Chartered Club. A Sports Club, a Golf Club, local Rugby, Soccer, Cricket, Tennis, Bowling or Fishing Club. A Social Club at your Work, a Craft Beer Bar/Pub, a local neighbourhood tavern or winery, or any other club you can think of!  Your local or another Off Sales Liquor Outlet in your town. 
You will know your local club, bar, or pub scene, so it's easier for you to make the connection between us for dispatch if you're a member of a Club as above, or you can approach your local Super Liquor Outlet.
Please ask your Licensed Liquor Establishment first to receive your first offering. It MUST pass through a Licensed Liquor Establishment, and not direct to a Public Member for us to stay within the Licensing Regulations.
You as the person who has made a 'Future's Voucher' purchase principal will ensure the keg is returned to us when your Group has emptied the keg. (You own the Ale, we own the Keg).
Keg transport fees will be inclusive of your purchase. Keep the Pre-sales Orders coming . There is NO CUT OFF after the campaign reaches target. 



The special InDemand feature allows future orders after the campaign finishes.

The Targets.

THE CAMPAIGN TARGET is US$11,000 this will allow us to brew Keg Ale for our New Zealand Home Audience, with redeemable Ale Future's Vouchers.This Stretch Limit amount MUST be met before this can happen.


STRETCH LIMIT 1 is US$100,000, which will allow us to brew and bottle ale for our international audience, offering Single 500 ml Bottle Tasting Samples. This Stretch Limit amount MUST be met before this can happen.
(Brewing Licenses not included).
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Where does the money go?


The CAMPAIGN TARGET OF US$11,000 MUST BE MET to be able to brew Manuka Magic-it's a beauty unique Kiwi Ale for you. That's the absolute minimum amount required to start production.


Anything less leaves us stranded, and I would have to re-launch the campaign to get the Funds in over campaign target to brew for you. 
Keg Ale (campaign target)
The Funds provided will go towards ingredients in the ale, costs of brewing, Government Excise Tax, storage, new kegs, transport, running costs of this campaign, bank fees, perk purchases, liquor licenses. 
Ideally it would be FANTASTIC to have enough Funds come in, so I can send off BOTTLED ALE TASTERS EVERYWHERE for you.
Bottling Ale adds substantial costs (stretch limit 1)
Those increased costs are for larger volumes brewed, for more ingredients, bottling costs, bottles packaging, label manufacture.
 $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Calling ALL INTERNATIONALS - it's for you as well.
A Brewer needs his own brewery. To serve New Zealand and Export Markets with these delicious Manuka Ales I do too.

That's a pretty good reason, but here's a better reason. 


It's so you can SEE YOUR NAME ON OUR BREWERY WALL. 

My Manuka Ales MUST go to INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. 
HOPS ARE IN TROUBLE, AND SO IS YOUR PINT OF BEER.
We could be heading for PEAK BEER! and reduced beer production. Beer would become a luxury item. 
What are your thoughts on that?


SO LET'S GET these delicious Manuka Ales ON THE MARKET, and take the sting out of this situation FOR EVERY DRINKER, BY CREATING A SOLUTION TO THIS UNTHINKABLE PROBLEM.

Can you imagine living without
telecommunication? Today, more than a billion people still don't have cellular
coverage*. Most of these unconnected people live in
 rural regions of Latin America, Africa, and Asia, and the main reason why
they're cut off from the world is because local cellular carriers deem them
economically nonviable, given that most can't afford to pay for cell service, living
on a couple of dollars per day or even less. 


What if there were a way
to provide both affordable cellular coverage and phones to the marginalized
people?  They could now use the phone to
communicate, obtain information, gain knowledge, receive/provide assistance, and much
more.


We've found a way to do just that (and more). 

We are brubru, a nonprofit organization, whose mission is to
connect the unconnected at the lowest possible price point, by establishing
self-sustaining, community-owned rural cellular networks, enabling
indigent communities to grow and thrive, creating a better world.


Our self-sustaining model is simple and effective:


1. Since most villages have
neither the
know-how nor the
upfront capital to establish and manage their local cellular network, we assist
them by:

(a) purchasing required equipment, such
as base transceiver stations (BTSs), antennas, phones, solar modules (if
there's no grid electricity), etc.
(b) assembling equipment, erecting cell
towers, installing antennas, etc.
(c) overseeing and maintaining
(troubleshooting) the cell network, to ensure optimal coverage.



2. Individual villages (local cell
networks) are wirelessly interconnected with one another, to create a single cellular network
that covers a vast territory, enabling  anyone on the network to call and
text anyone else on the network for only a few dollars (in local currency) per
month. Calling and texting outside the network is also seamless and
affordable via Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). In the villages that don't
already have an internet service provider, we
establish nonprofit ISPs.


3. Over time, the local cell network
pays for itself, and each connected village is able to pay back the provided
initial capital, at which point all revenue remains in each village, and
can be used to improve local social services, such as schools, clinics,
etc.

Why?In today’s world, we can check our email with just a look at the wrist (+1 to Pebble), find a mate with only a swipe of a thumb (looking at you tinder), and learn about business with one $100k+ check and 4 years of our time (Big ups to you, Universities of America). We are in a time where social media usage is near necessity, and student loan and youth unemployment rates are skyrocketing. Today’s teens and young adults need more avenues to make legitimate streams of income. They need it now more than ever; however 50% of us in today’s younger generations are under or unemployed in America.Why should you Care?Well, this leads to more and more youth getting involved with the wrong crowds trying to make money and make ends meet (or at VERY least, to never have to eat funfetti frosting, and call it breakfast ever again). So is it really a surprise thatby age 23, over 40% percent of American adolescents and young adults have been arrested at least once for something other than a minor traffic violation? To give you a better idea that’s over 30 million arrests, and the average arrest can cost taxpayers up to $1,000, you do the math. Pro-tip, it’s a lot.As many as 7 out of every 10 high school  teenagers have expressed interest in wanting to start their own business, yet have no simple way of gaining financial literacy, business experience, or access to mentors who can lead them down the right path.  We can pass a standardized test and protest for a $15 an hour minimum wage; still few of us have any idea how to balance a bank account, create a budget or make a business plan. In these problems, YouthBloc was born. Our mission is to unite educate and transform youth through entrepreneurship.Be immortalized on our wall of fame, by making a $25 contribution now.The PlatformEducation CenterWith the cost of higher learning at insane highs, causing more and more youth to search for new ways to gain business insight. YouthBloc provides an alternative to the everyday; revolutionizing the way teens and young adults look at and learn about the world of business.YouthBloc members will have unlimited 24/7 access to free educational business classes.  Teaching the necessary business and life skills for navigating today’s complex financial world.

How Do Users Make Money?We want to solve the youth crime and unemployment epidemic; to do that we need to create new legal streams of income for our users. Step 2: Just use YouthBloc...Advertising RevenueSeriously it’s that easy. We could never accept all the advertising revenue when so many of our users could use it more. Considering it can’t even be generated without you, we’re more than happy to give you equal net profits that YouthBloc footprint creates. Basically we want you use YouthBloc and we want you to learn and earn, so the more you actively use YouthBloc, more advertising profits your footprint creates, and you’re getting half of it… So that’s pretty sweet.Commerce CenterCustom E-StorefrontsYouth users will have the option to create simple and customizable E-Storefronts attached to their profile, using the templates we provide, and then start earning money immediately.

Virtual Mentor SystemWe understand the benefits of mentoring young people when we hear the powerful stories of teens whose lives have been changed by a single, caring adult. If you listen, those stories are everywhere. Like us, you likely have a story of a mentor from your own past. We want to make sure everyone gets their own story.Unique algorithm matches youth users with the best possible matched mentor for ongoing guidance.Mentors will include:
Select Celebrities, 
Business Professionals
Community Leaders
A large five year study, sponsored by Big Brothers Big Sisters found that children with mentors were more confident and had fewer behavioral problems. Young people showed increased belief in their abilities to succeed in school and felt less anxiety related to peer pressure. By evaluating data from Big Brothers Big Sisters, we can see:
59% of mentored teens get better grades
27% of mentored youth are less likely to begin using alcohol 
52% are less likely to skip school
Mentored young people are more likely set career goals and to start taking steps to realize them.

<p>Nu 5 jaar later zijn wij  in Nederland nog steeds in het beginstadium voor wat betreft het vervaardigen van vleesvervangers.</p>
<p> Er is een land dat al decennia lang vlees- en visvervangers vervaardigd omdat de roep hierom heel groot was. Vlees- en visvervangers, die bijna niet van echt vlees en vis te onderscheiden zijn. </p>

<br/><p>Dit (ei)land is Taiwan waar boeddhisme een belangrijke religie is. Boeddhisme en vegetarisme gaan aldaar hand in hand. Taiwan telt 23 miljoen inwoners waarvan 24% boeddhisten (5.5 miljoen). Uit een studie blijkt dat 7 tot 15 % van de bevolking streng boeddhistisch is (1.5 tot 3.5 miljoen mensen) en zich dus streng houden aan de regels van het vegetarisme. </p>

<p><b>Kwalitatieve doelstelling.</b></p>
<p>De kwalitatieve doelstelling is om een levensvatbare zaak winstgevend te maken en daarnaast streef ik er naar naamsbekendheid te kunnen opbouwen als de enige volwaardige specialist in vis- en vleesvervangers op het web.</p>
<p><b>Kwantitatieve doelstelling.</b></p>
<p>De kwantitatieve doelstelling is het genereren van een gezonde cashflow uit de onderneming binnen 2 jaar om zodoende de kosten te dekken en voldoende ondernemersloon uit de onderneming te onttrekken. Daarnaast zal er getracht worden gedurende de jaren reserves op te bouwen.</p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Concurrentie:</b></p>
<p>Wat betreft de positie in de markt kan worden geconstateerd, dat er enige (indirecte ) concurrentie aanwezig is, maar gezien mijn specialistische benadering van de markt zal ik zeker een plaats kunnen innemen. Er worden namelijk tegen een aantrekkelijke prijs kwalitatief goede en smakelijke producten aangeboden.</p>
<p>Onze producten zijn over het algemeen tweemaal zoveel per verpakking als wat u op dit moment te koop krijgt aangeboden, maar voor ongeveer de zelfde prijs.</p>

<p><b></b></p>
<p>In de Europese Unie lag het aantal
vegetariërs in 2013 tussen 2 en 10 procent. Volgens een onderzoek van LEI
Wageningen UR was in 2012 zo’n 4,5% van de Nederlandse bevolking
vegetariër of veganist (circa 750.000).
Daarnaast eet 14,8% hooguit een à twee dagen per week vlees.</p>
<p>Volgens de vereniging Ethisch Vegetarisch
Alternatief zou in 2012 zo’n 2 à 3 procent van de Belgen totaal-vegetariër
zijn.</p>
<p>In Vlaanderen en Brussel zou zo’n 5 à 6
procent van de inwoners deeltijd-vegetariër zijn. Volgens een onderzoek voeren
Nederlandse vegetariërs gemiddeld kleinere huishoudens, hebben vaker een hogere
opleiding genoten, hebben in het algemeen een hogere socio-economische status,
en gezondheid speelt vaak een belangrijke rol in hun leven dan bij vleeseters.</p>

<div>
<div>
<p>VlenoVi®  zal starten als een kleinschalige eenmanszaak. Met uitgekiende promotie en aanbevelingen van tevreden klanten kan ik het concept verder uitbouwen.</p>
<p>Het is dus de bedoeling om deze producten in Nederland en Vlaanderen aan de man te brengen in een zo groot mogelijke variatie</p>
<p>Hierdoor ziet VlenoVi® het als haar opdracht om de service en klantgerichtheid- stap voor stap - uit te breiden en toegankelijk te maken voor Nederland en Vlaanderen om zodoende iedereen in staat te stellen hoogstaand vegetarische producten online aan te schaffen.</p>
<p>De producten waar geen ei en melk componenten in voorkomen zijn bij uitstek geschikt voor de veganist.</p>
<p>Ik wil voor VlenoVi® een Halal-certificaat aanvragen, want zolang er geen dierlijke gelatine in voorkomen is het namelijk Halal.</p>
<p>Met betrekking tot het koosjer zijn ligt dit ingewikkelder. Ik zal de producten dus niet als koosjer zijnde aanbieden.</p>
<div>
<div>Eindelijk, vegetarisch producten niet alleen voor de dierenliefhebbers 
onder ons, maar  ook voor iedereen die gewoon dol is op lekker eten. Ik streef 
ernaar om producten voor het hele gezin te creëren. Niet alleen zijn onze producten gezond en voedzaam, maar uiteindelijk verrassend en absoluut 
heerlijk! Ik garandeer u dat u na het eten van onze producten u niet terug wil naar het oude.</div>
<div></div>Via de website worden (op termijn) suggesties gegeven voor gerechten waarin de vlees- en visvervangers heel goed toegepast kunnen worden.</div>

<li>
<p>Gezondheid: Veel vegetariërs zijn ervan overtuigd dat een voeding zonder vlees en vis gezonder is. Recente onderzoeken laten zien dat vegetariërs langer leven en minder last hebben van overgewicht, suikerziekte en hart- en vaatziekten;</p>

<p>Bij een vegetarische voeding wordt geen vlees en vis gegeten. Een vegetarische voeding kenmerkt zich vaak door meer plantaardige producten.  Hierdoor is de voeding vaak rijker aan vitaminen, mineralen en voedings-vezels. Er kan prima gezond vegetarisch worden gegeten. Bepaalde voedingsstoffen komen minder voor bij een vegetarische voeding. Sommige vegetariërs gebruiken daarom naast hun voeding een supplement. Dit wordt gedaan om tekorten aan bepaalde voedingsstoffen te voorkomen. Een vegetariër moet goed opletten of bepaalde voedingsstoffen voldoende binnenkomen. Het gaat dan om:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eiwit: Eiwit heeft veel functies in het lichaam. De belangrijkste functies van eiwit is die als bouwsteen van spieren en weefsels. Als er te weinig eiwit binnen komt kunnen spieren aangetast worden;</li>
<li>Vitamine B1: Deze vitamine is voornamelijk belangrijk voor het zenuwstelsel. Een tekort kan problemen geven zoals geheugenverlies of concentratieproblemen;</li>
<li>Vitamine B12: Een tekort aan vitamine B12 geeft pas na lange tijd problemen. Dit komt omdat het lichaam in staat is een bepaalde hoeveelheid in het lichaam op te slaan. Als er maanden tot jaren te weinig binnenkomt kan er bijvoorbeeld bloedarmoede ontstaan. Bloedarmoede geeft klachten als vermoeidheid en duizeligheid;</li>
<li>Vitamine D: Een tekort aan vitamine D kan de kans op botontkalking vergroten;</li>
<li>Ijzer: Te weinig ijzer kan ook bloedarmoede veroorzaken;</li>
<li>Omega 3: Weinig omega 3 geeft geen problemen. Toch kan omega 3 heel nuttig zijn voor een gezond lichaam. Bij voldoende inname verlaagt het bijvoorbeeld aanzienlijk de kans op hart-en vaatziekten.</li>
</ul>
<div>Van al deze voedingsstoffen kan er een tekort ontstaan omdat ze voornamelijk in dierlijke producten voorkomen.</div>

<p>Bij een vegetarische voeding wordt er veel plantaardig gegeten. Dit is vaak positief voor de gezondheid. Een vegetarische voeding met weinig verzadigd vet en veel vezels werkt risico verlagend op hart- en vaatziekten, Parkinson en Alzheimer. Een beperking van de vleesconsumptie kan al voldoende zijn om gezondheidswinst te behalen. Wanneer er te veel rood vlees wordt gegeten verhoogt de kans op darmkanker.</p>
<p>Het blijkt dat vegetariërs minder lijden aan hart-en vaatziekten en suikerziekte. Ook hebben vegetariërs minder last van overgewicht. Een duidelijke reden hiervoor is nog niet aan te wijzen. Overigens is het aangetoond dat vegetariërs er een volledige gezondere leefstijl op na houden. Meer <i>beweging</i> en het <i>eetgedrag</i> lijkt bij te dragen aan de gezondheidswinst.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Overigens kan een vegetarische voeding ook ongezond zijn. Dit gebeurt wanneer er onvoldoende rekening wordt gehouden met het feit dat vlees en vis in de voeding ontbreekt. Er kan daardoor een tekort ontstaan aan bepaalde voedingsstoffen. Als hier wel rekening mee wordt gehouden kan een vegetarische voeding gezonder zijn dan reguliere voeding met vlees en vis. Voeding met vlees of vis bevat overwegend meer verzadigd vet.

VlenoVi® wordt een webshop waar je simpel en snel je vlees en vis vervangers van top kwaliteit kan kopen. Als vegetariër help je mee aan de reductie van CO2. Je kunt ook een halt toebrengen aan de wantoestanden in de bio-industrie en je kunt helpen dierenleed te verzachten. Is de stap van vleeseter naar vegetariër te groot voor jou overweeg dan om flexitariër te worden. Met de producten van VlevoVi® heb je niet het gevoel dat je vlees of vis mist.Short version:
 VlenoVi® is a webshop where you can easily and quickly buy your meat and fish substitutes of top quality. As a vegetarian, you can help to reduce CO2. You can also bring a halt to the abuses in factory farming and you can help to mitigate animal cruelty. If the step from being a meat eater to vegetarian is too big for you then consider to be a flexitarian. With VlevoVi® products you do not feel that you are missing any meat or fish.

De lange versie:
Als vegetariër blijft het voor mij nog steeds een probleem om goede vlees- en vis vervangers te vinden. In de meeste supermarkten ligt er wel een assortiment van vleesvervangers, maar het is uiteindelijk allemaal hetzelfde; een mix van eieren met wat groenten, een mix van kaas of iets van soja of tofu en worsten die, zodra ze in contact komen met vocht, 3 tot 4 keer uitzetten en op je bord eruitzien als enorme gedrochten. 

                             




Nu 5 jaar later zijn wij  in Nederland nog steeds in het beginstadium voor wat betreft het vervaardigen van vleesvervangers.
 Er is een land dat al decennia lang vlees- en visvervangers vervaardigd omdat de roep hierom heel groot was. Vlees- en visvervangers, die bijna niet van echt vlees en vis te onderscheiden zijn. 

         

Dit (ei)land is Taiwan waar boeddhisme een belangrijke religie is. Boeddhisme en vegetarisme gaan aldaar hand in hand. Taiwan telt 23 miljoen inwoners waarvan 24% boeddhisten (5.5 miljoen). Uit een studie blijkt dat 7 tot 15 % van de bevolking streng boeddhistisch is (1.5 tot 3.5 miljoen mensen) en zich dus streng houden aan de regels van het vegetarisme. 



       


Het idee:

Het bedrijfsidee is dus om een webshop te exploiteren waar vlees- en visvervangers besteld kunnen worden.


De levering zal plaats vinden
via reguliere pakketpost waarbij het streven is om elke dag te leveren behalve
zondag.
De producten worden in speciale diepvriesverpakking verzonden, zodat de producten gegarandeerd vers blijven.


De naam:

                                  
VlenoVi® is de samenvoeging van de woorden ""Vlees noch Vis"".
Made in Taiwan.

Assortiment:
Er zal een groot assortiment aanwezig zijn
waar de klant uit kan kiezen. In het begin zal een assortiment bestaande uit
circa 30 producten worden aangeboden welke langzamerhand wordt aangevuld met
nieuwe producten. Wanneer de webwinkel in
bekendheid en omzet verder groeit, zal aldus het assortiment stapsgewijs worden
uitgebreid.

Productkwaliteit:
De producten van VlenoVi®  zullen van goede
kwaliteit zijn. Dit houdt in dat er onder andere goed wordt gekeken naar de
ingrediënten van de producten, de herkomst en de houdbaarheid. De vlees- en
visvervangers zijn uniek te noemen als we kijken naar wat de directe
concurrenten aanbieden.
Veel vleesvervangers die momenteel in
Nederland worden aangeboden zijn uit dezelfde soort ingrediënten opgebouwd. Taiwan
is een land dat zich, in tegenstelling tot de Westerse wereld, al een lange
tijd bezig houdt met vegetarische recepten. Deze zijn opgebouwd uit natuurlijke
ingrediënten en worden in Taiwan in groten getale gebruikt. Deze natuurlijke en
unieke samenstellingen van voedsel worden momenteel nog nauwelijks aangeboden
in Nederland.



Service:
Vlenovi®  zal haar klanten een
goede service verlenen:



De prijs/kwaliteitverhouding zal
uitstekend zijn. Deze wordt bepaald aan de hand van de kostprijs en benodigde
inkomsten om de kosten te dekken;


Een groot aanbod aan vlees – en
visvervangers;


Relatief snelle en goedkope levering;


Klanten hebben de mogelijkheid om op
verschillende manieren te betalen;

Klachten en suggesties worden op gepaste
wijze afgehandeld.


Kwalitatieve doelstelling.
De kwalitatieve doelstelling is om een levensvatbare zaak winstgevend te maken en daarnaast streef ik er naar naamsbekendheid te kunnen opbouwen als de enige volwaardige specialist in vis- en vleesvervangers op het web.
Kwantitatieve doelstelling.
De kwantitatieve doelstelling is het genereren van een gezonde cashflow uit de onderneming binnen 2 jaar om zodoende de kosten te dekken en voldoende ondernemersloon uit de onderneming te onttrekken. Daarnaast zal er getracht worden gedurende de jaren reserves op te bouwen.
Concurrentie:
Wat betreft de positie in de markt kan worden geconstateerd, dat er enige (indirecte ) concurrentie aanwezig is, maar gezien mijn specialistische benadering van de markt zal ik zeker een plaats kunnen innemen. Er worden namelijk tegen een aantrekkelijke prijs kwalitatief goede en smakelijke producten aangeboden.
Onze producten zijn over het algemeen tweemaal zoveel per verpakking als wat u op dit moment te koop krijgt aangeboden, maar voor ongeveer de zelfde prijs.
Cijfers:

In de Europese Unie lag het aantal
vegetariërs in 2013 tussen 2 en 10 procent. Volgens een onderzoek van LEI
Wageningen UR was in 2012 zo’n 4,5% van de Nederlandse bevolking
vegetariër of veganist (circa 750.000).
Daarnaast eet 14,8% hooguit een à twee dagen per week vlees.
Volgens de vereniging Ethisch Vegetarisch
Alternatief zou in 2012 zo’n 2 à 3 procent van de Belgen totaal-vegetariër
zijn.
In Vlaanderen en Brussel zou zo’n 5 à 6
procent van de inwoners deeltijd-vegetariër zijn. Volgens een onderzoek voeren
Nederlandse vegetariërs gemiddeld kleinere huishoudens, hebben vaker een hogere
opleiding genoten, hebben in het algemeen een hogere socio-economische status,
en gezondheid speelt vaak een belangrijke rol in hun leven dan bij vleeseters.



Missie:



VlenoVi®  zal starten als een kleinschalige eenmanszaak. Met uitgekiende promotie en aanbevelingen van tevreden klanten kan ik het concept verder uitbouwen.
Het is dus de bedoeling om deze producten in Nederland en Vlaanderen aan de man te brengen in een zo groot mogelijke variatie
Hierdoor ziet VlenoVi® het als haar opdracht om de service en klantgerichtheid- stap voor stap - uit te breiden en toegankelijk te maken voor Nederland en Vlaanderen om zodoende iedereen in staat te stellen hoogstaand vegetarische producten online aan te schaffen.
De producten waar geen ei en melk componenten in voorkomen zijn bij uitstek geschikt voor de veganist.
Ik wil voor VlenoVi® een Halal-certificaat aanvragen, want zolang er geen dierlijke gelatine in voorkomen is het namelijk Halal.
Met betrekking tot het koosjer zijn ligt dit ingewikkelder. Ik zal de producten dus niet als koosjer zijnde aanbieden.

Eindelijk, vegetarisch producten niet alleen voor de dierenliefhebbers 
onder ons, maar  ook voor iedereen die gewoon dol is op lekker eten. Ik streef 
ernaar om producten voor het hele gezin te creëren. Niet alleen zijn onze producten gezond en voedzaam, maar uiteindelijk verrassend en absoluut 
heerlijk! Ik garandeer u dat u na het eten van onze producten u niet terug wil naar het oude.
Via de website worden (op termijn) suggesties gegeven voor gerechten waarin de vlees- en visvervangers heel goed toegepast kunnen worden.

Bij iedere hap die u neemt van onze producten zal u zich afvragen  ""is dit echt vegetarisch?""



Wees voorbereid u zal verbaasd zijn ...

De lacto-ovo-vegetariër: Dit is de grootste groep vegetariërs. Er word geen vlees en vis gegeten, maar wel eieren en zuivel:


 De lacto-vegetariër: Er wordt wel zuivel gegeten en gedronken, maar geen eieren, vlees en vis;                                     


 De ovo-vegetariër: Er worden wel eieren gegeten, maar geen vlees, vis of zuivel gegeten of gedronken. 

Verschillende redenen kunnen aanleiding zijn voor het kiezen van vegetarisme.
Een vaak gehoorde motivatie is het principieel tegengaan van dierenleed.
Vooral de bio-industrie en het bijkomende dierenleed is in de ogen van vegetariërs niet goed. Andere redenen om vegetarisch te eten zijn:




Milieu: Dierlijke voedingsmiddelen hebben een grotere impact op het milieu dan plantaardige voedingsmiddelen. De hoeveelheid CO2 uitstoot is een stuk groter. CO2 uitstoot is schadelijk voor het milieu;

De motieven om vegetariër te worden, worden niet door iedereen begrepen. Zodra iemand vegetariër wordt, krijgt hij of zij voor zijn omgeving vaak een ""geitenwollensokken imago"". Het kan dan soms lastig zijn om de motieven van vegetarisme goed te beargumenteren. Redenen om niet vegetarisch te eten:


Smaak;
Godsdienst;
Kans op tekort aan bepaalde voedingsstoffen.

Vegetarische voedingsmiddelen zijn te herkennen aan een keurmerk. Dit is het Internationale Vegetarische keurmerk. Dit keurmerk geeft aan dat het product volledig vegetarisch is. En toch zijn er producten niet geheel vegetarisch waarvan je het niet zou verwachten. Voorbeelden daarvan zijn pudding of sommige snoepjes. Hierin is gelatine verwerkt.

Omega 3: Weinig omega 3 geeft geen problemen. Toch kan omega 3 heel nuttig zijn voor een gezond lichaam. Bij voldoende inname verlaagt het bijvoorbeeld aanzienlijk de kans op hart-en vaatziekten.

Van al deze voedingsstoffen kan er een tekort ontstaan omdat ze voornamelijk in dierlijke producten voorkomen.

              

Gezondheid:





Bij een vegetarische voeding wordt er veel plantaardig gegeten. Dit is vaak positief voor de gezondheid. Een vegetarische voeding met weinig verzadigd vet en veel vezels werkt risico verlagend op hart- en vaatziekten, Parkinson en Alzheimer. Een beperking van de vleesconsumptie kan al voldoende zijn om gezondheidswinst te behalen. Wanneer er te veel rood vlees wordt gegeten verhoogt de kans op darmkanker.

Overigens is het aangetoond dat vegetariërs er een volledige gezondere leefstijl op na houden. Meer beweging en het eetgedrag lijkt bij te dragen aan de gezondheidswinst.
Overigens kan een vegetarische voeding ook ongezond zijn. Dit gebeurt wanneer er onvoldoende rekening wordt gehouden met het feit dat vlees en vis in de voeding ontbreekt. Er kan daardoor een tekort ontstaan aan bepaalde voedingsstoffen. Als hier wel rekening mee wordt gehouden kan een vegetarische voeding gezonder zijn dan reguliere voeding met vlees en vis. Voeding met vlees of vis bevat overwegend meer verzadigd vet. Te veel verzadigd vet is weer nadelig voor de gezondheid. Het kan het risico op hart- en vaatziekten verhogen. 
Voordelen:






Bij een gevarieerde voeding met oog voor tekorten is gezondheidswinst te behalen;

 Bijdragen aan een beter milieu. Voor de productie van vlees is veel water en energie nodig. Daarnaast levert de productie veel CO2 uitstoot op, wat schadelijk is voor het milieu;

Het eten van minder vlees draagt bij aan beter dierenwelzijn. Het soort vlees dat wordt gegeten is hierbij erg belangrijk. Bij biologisch vlees hebben dieren beter leefomstandigheden gehad;


Geldbesparing. Vlees is overwegend duur. Door minder of helemaal geen vlees te eten kan geld bespaard worden. Overigens kunnen vleesvervangers ook prijzig zijn.


  Nadelen:



Minder aanbod in restaurants;


Risico op tekorten aan ijzer, eiwit, vitaminen B12 en B1;


Sociale problemen. Bij andere mensen gaan eten kan problemen geven. Sommige mensen vinden het lastig een vegetarisch voeding op tafel te zetten. Dit kan als vervelend ervaren worden.",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p><h2>FAQ<br/>
</h2><br/>
<p><b>1. What about a national, regional or ethnic dish that cannot be prepared abroad without certain ingredients?</b></p>
<p>We often get this question!<br/>
We know that some dishes need ingredients that can be found only
in a certain countries or regions. We also know that all cuisines use a base of
ingredients found anywhere in the world. You can also find ""exotic"" ingredients in supermarkets, hypermarkets or
big grocery stores. In big cities you can find specialty stores that provide almost anything coming from other countries.<br/></p>
<p>That said, certainly some dishes are impossible to
cook outside their country of origin because of a lack of special ingredients. Nevertheless those represent a small minority of dishes that a country has to offer. If you want to taste those particular dishes we
suggest you to either contact a guest-cook coming from that country to check if they are able to provide those after a trip to their homeland or by traveling
yourself to that country. That way, you can discover every taste and flavor that part of the
world has to offer.</p>
<p><br/>
<b>2. Why doesn't my credit card work?</b></p>
<p>Indiegogo accepts card payments including Visa, MasterCard,
Discovery and American Express credit or debit cards, but <b>not </b>prepaid
cards.</p>
<p>For further clarification, even though it's called a <b>debit
card</b>, a <b>prepaid debit card</b> is very different from a bank account <b>debit
card</b>. A bank account <b>debit card</b> is linked to your checking account;
a <b>prepaid debit card</b> is not. Instead, you pay in advance to load funds
onto a <b>prepaid card</b>, and then use the money you have loaded onto the <b>card</b>. </p>
<p><b>3. About Dinner in the Sky, Airship/Helicopter tours perk
rewards</b></p>
<p>We understand that not all of our supporter are in the US or EU; in those cases we will try to arrange for awarding those perks in that supporter's specific geographic zone. Helicopter tours are pretty common. Unfortunately airship tours are currently present only in Europe. You can still choose that option but then you would have to travel to central Europe.</p><p><b>4. About Cook@Home website service
fees</b></p>
<p>To sustain the whole project
and a platform that reaches and supports every country in the world,
we will charge a small percentage fee every time a reservation is be made.
This fee will be shared by both parties, mostly by the guest cook, and it will
be calculated on the basis of entire amount of the transaction. The fee itself will be
between 7% and 12%, depending on the amount of the reservation. This way, patrons can
save money when booking large reservations (i.e. for many patrons or reserving many
dishes). This will cover the cost of running the platform while providing a high
standard of quality. These fees might also change because of promotions and geographic locations.<br/></p><b>5. So, who exactly can become a guest cook?</b>
<p>Simply put, anyone who knows how to cook and has the passion and patience to
cook for others. We believe that, in most cases, people who cooks out of passion know recipes that aren't found in any cookbook or restaurants. Each person can add a culinary flavor that cannot be found anywhere. In any
case, there are some folks who could probably make more use of this platform, such as
exchange students, expats, professional chefs (why not?) , the unemployed, pensioners and the retired etc. Imagine a Japanese ,Greek or Maltese student living in your city that will teach you how sushi is prepared  or even a person
that can teach you how to prepare and cook some exotic historical cuisine, like
Medieval, Aztec or Ottoman! The possibilities are so many, there is an entire
world of aromas and flavors out there, maybe closer to you than you think!</p><p><br/></p><p><b>6. I am afraid you will not deliver my perk. What can I do to be sure?<br/></b></p><p>Campaign owners <strong>are</strong> held by Indiegogo Terms of Use (<a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/about/terms"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.indiegogo.com/about/terms</a>)
 to fulfill perks. If for any reason they're unable to offer you the 
perk you claimed, campaign owners are obligated to reach out to their 
contributors and work out a mutually satisfactory resolution- this 
resolution could be an alternative perk, a promise to issue the promised
 perk at a later date if the campaign owner is able to raise additional 
funds, or a refund. We always recommend opening up a conversation with 
the campaign owner if you have any question about what will happen to 
your contribution if the campaign owner is unable to raise the funds 
they need to complete their project.<br/></p>

FAQ

1. What about a national, regional or ethnic dish that cannot be prepared abroad without certain ingredients?
We often get this question!
We know that some dishes need ingredients that can be found only
in a certain countries or regions. We also know that all cuisines use a base of
ingredients found anywhere in the world. You can also find ""exotic"" ingredients in supermarkets, hypermarkets or
big grocery stores. In big cities you can find specialty stores that provide almost anything coming from other countries.
That said, certainly some dishes are impossible to
cook outside their country of origin because of a lack of special ingredients. Nevertheless those represent a small minority of dishes that a country has to offer. If you want to taste those particular dishes we
suggest you to either contact a guest-cook coming from that country to check if they are able to provide those after a trip to their homeland or by traveling
yourself to that country. That way, you can discover every taste and flavor that part of the
world has to offer.

2. Why doesn't my credit card work?
Indiegogo accepts card payments including Visa, MasterCard,
Discovery and American Express credit or debit cards, but not prepaid
cards.
For further clarification, even though it's called a debit
card, a prepaid debit card is very different from a bank account debit
card. A bank account debit card is linked to your checking account;
a prepaid debit card is not. Instead, you pay in advance to load funds
onto a prepaid card, and then use the money you have loaded onto the card. 
3. About Dinner in the Sky, Airship/Helicopter tours perk
rewards
We understand that not all of our supporter are in the US or EU; in those cases we will try to arrange for awarding those perks in that supporter's specific geographic zone. Helicopter tours are pretty common. Unfortunately airship tours are currently present only in Europe. You can still choose that option but then you would have to travel to central Europe.4. About Cook@Home website service
fees
To sustain the whole project
and a platform that reaches and supports every country in the world,
we will charge a small percentage fee every time a reservation is be made.
This fee will be shared by both parties, mostly by the guest cook, and it will
be calculated on the basis of entire amount of the transaction. The fee itself will be
between 7% and 12%, depending on the amount of the reservation. This way, patrons can
save money when booking large reservations (i.e. for many patrons or reserving many
dishes). This will cover the cost of running the platform while providing a high
standard of quality. These fees might also change because of promotions and geographic locations.5. So, who exactly can become a guest cook?
Simply put, anyone who knows how to cook and has the passion and patience to
cook for others. We believe that, in most cases, people who cooks out of passion know recipes that aren't found in any cookbook or restaurants. Each person can add a culinary flavor that cannot be found anywhere. In any
case, there are some folks who could probably make more use of this platform, such as
exchange students, expats, professional chefs (why not?) , the unemployed, pensioners and the retired etc. Imagine a Japanese ,Greek or Maltese student living in your city that will teach you how sushi is prepared  or even a person
that can teach you how to prepare and cook some exotic historical cuisine, like
Medieval, Aztec or Ottoman! The possibilities are so many, there is an entire
world of aromas and flavors out there, maybe closer to you than you think!6. I am afraid you will not deliver my perk. What can I do to be sure?Campaign owners are held by Indiegogo Terms of Use (http://www.indiegogo.com/about/terms)
 to fulfill perks. If for any reason they're unable to offer you the 
perk you claimed, campaign owners are obligated to reach out to their 
contributors and work out a mutually satisfactory resolution- this 
resolution could be an alternative perk, a promise to issue the promised
 perk at a later date if the campaign owner is able to raise additional 
funds, or a refund. We always recommend opening up a conversation with 
the campaign owner if you have any question about what will happen to 
your contribution if the campaign owner is unable to raise the funds 
they need to complete their project.",9.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi, we are Raphael and Marvin, two young
brothers who love to develop apps.</p>
<p>Inseparable during our childhood, especially
when it came to computers. In 2014 we founded the Square Apps Company and
started to develop apps. When we discovered our shared dedication to smoothies,
it was clear that it would be our first major project. However, each of us two
founders has another reference on this subject.</p>
<p>Marvin is always in search of new and
interesting recipes. He tried many different smoothie apps, but there was
always a lack of the ease of use, the design and the pictures disappointed.</p>
<p> Raphael plays his experience as a professional
bartender and a cook. He knows what is important for recipes and explains that
it does not have to be complicated. After several long summer days and lots of
delicious smoothie creations, we came to the decision to bring the public
closer to smoothies. It should be possible for anyone to be able to make
delicious smoothies. </p>
<p><b>Now we want wo share

<p>On May 7<sup>th</sup>, Lacey-Lou locked its doors and
declared an unexpected hiatus from operations. 
This has been an unwelcome shock to Victoria’s art community. </p>
<p><strong><em>Lacey-Lou opened its doors on April the 5, 2014, and has
since hosted over 500 performances, and showcased work from dozens of local
visual artists, while offering high quality yet affordable local food and
drink. It has become a social hub that fosters creativity, inspiration and the
sharing of ideas.</em></strong> </p>
<p>With 4 months of daily events scheduled, the decision to
close wasn’t an easy one and has already created a lot of commotion. <em><em>“We have
been operating day-by-day from the moment we opened”</em></em> says Natasha Grau-Ensminger,
founder of Lacey-Lou. “It is astonishing that we made it one year in the restaurant
industry with no working capital. We haven’t been shy in discussing our difficulties
with our patrons, however it is difficult for any person to comprehend how
severe the problem is when we’re filling our space almost every day.”</p>
<p>These challenges began in 2013, when it was discovered that
the heritage space had more structural issues than could have been predicted. “Plans
had to be re-drawn, meaning the building permit had to be updated, and
everything was put on hold many times over. <strong>Our two months of renovations
turned into seven, during which time we were paying rent and generating no
income</strong>” Natasha explains. “By the time we were ready to open, our operating
money was gone but we chose to give the business a chance regardless. After the
thousands of volunteer hours, over 20 inspections and 12 permits obtained, we
couldn’t not give this business a chance. Everyone believed in it.”</p>
<p>What happened next they could not have predicted. The lounge
was quickly flooded with requests for musical acts, comedy, improv, live
painting, and art displays. The waitlist grew, as did attendance. “The space
turned into a cultural hub, connecting people and fostering creativity, with
affordable exposure.”</p>
<p>The building in which Lacey-Lou is located is owned by the
University of Victoria. “This building was donated by Michael Williams, whose
passion was in art and creating community. I hope he would have been over the moon
to see what has been created” says Natasha.</p>
<p>So what now? “This business can float itself; it is the
initial debt that has caught up with us to the extent that had we not decided
to close, that decision would have been made for us within days. Once we have
dealt with that, we’ll work hard to ensure that Lacey-Lou becomes a staple to
downtown Victoria. Sadly we aren’t eligible for funding or grants as we are a
for-profit business, despite the many community events we hold. We want to keep
the space accessible for all, where students and artists can continue to hold their
events with low cover charge and rental fees.”</p><p>“If we can’t hold events in our venue, then we will organize what we can
in public spaces in order to continue connecting and inspiring people through
art and creativity!”</p><p>
</p><p>Lacey-Lou hopes to reopen its doors on June 1<sup>st</sup>. </p><p>
</p><p><strong>Where oh where does the funding go?</strong></p>
<p>As the renovations left the business with no operating

ABOUT WINGPACT
We cofounded Wingpact because we believe that when women begin to apply their financial resources to projects they care about, a more just and equal world will be created. We wrote this book as the first step toward catalyzing change, pursuing our vision of a world in which everyone has the opportunity to successfully express their talents and realize their dreams. Though we come from diverse backgrounds, cultures, and phases in our lives—from a single career woman to a mother of four—we are united by our passion for empowering women and improving the global culture around investment.

This money goes directly to the following:  Software to be able to complete the algorithm through data science and behavioral study. Creating the data sets in order to harness the best results from both the end user (founder) and Investor (Angel & VC)  Consulting.

This server has information about current energy status of a person or a group of people, or an object and about every other detail.

By fulfilling required energy stocks of each person it is possible to move this world to better side or make personally yours or someone`s Life better or worst,but cause of valuable reasons (such as contributions to this project or ignoring it).Crossing`s System also has enough powerfull components which perform their roles in System`s 24/7 stable work and <b>billions</b>  the-other-world`s workers (Heaven`s included).

Improvements for people`s relationships and social status changings.

<p><span>5.<span>  </span></span>In this moment there are 38

Ice can introduce elements into your spirits like chlorine, sodium, fluoride and other things added to tap water via municipal water treatment facilities.
So how can you enjoy your favourite spirits chilled while not altering their taste or watering them down? Our flagship product: The Amazeballs™ Gift PackThe answer is Amazeballs™ -- premium stainless steel beverage chillers designed to do exactly that! They are constructed from #304 stainless steel - this is a food safe grade stainless steel that is used in things like cutlery and surgical tools. The two stainless steel hemispheres are welded together, with a small area left open. Then the stainless steel shell is filled with a food safe grade freezer gel - not unlike the freezer gel you find in a freezer/ice pack. The opening is then welded shut that the shell is polished to a gorgeous mirrored finish.
How to use Amazeballs™
Why do you want Amazeballs™ instead of ""Drink Stones""?Because drink stones, traditionally made from granite or soapstone, just do not work as well. The thermal capacity of stainless steel, in combination with the freezer gel core is far superior to that of what is basically a rock.  In fact we put Amazeballs™ head-to-head with a leading brand of drink stones and found that not only did Amazeballs™ chill the spirits quicker, they chilled them much better, and kept them colder for longer. The spherical shape also gives Amazeballs™ an advantage as there is more surface area for energy transfer.
Chill Test
Why I need your help.Amazeballs™ has really been off to a good start for me - I have worked really hard at getting the product into some major retailers very quickly by cold calling and putting myself in front of the right people. That is the good news for me. The bad news is that as a small independent supplier who is dealing with major retail chains, cash flow is an issue.

<p>I am very lucky to be a visible part of the DIY scenes in Buffalo, but also very proud that I’m a part of a community of people that are accepting of everyone no matter their age, race, creed, gender identity, or sexual orientation. My hard work has given me somewhat decent exposure, but more importantly it has gave me a direction in my life I desperately lacked. My passion to help others gave my life purpose, and in turn, has become a full-time job in itself cranking out illustrations and designs. It gives me great joy that my skills are put to use by bands and musicians to help them grow and reach entirely new audiences through a visual medium. Along the way I’ve had a chance to work with some really talented musicians and build some great friendships with them. My past work has included a T-shirt illustration for San Francisco-based rapper <a href=""satellitehigh.bandcamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b></b></a><b><a href=""http://satellitehigh.bandcamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Satellite High</a></b> for a single of his (“The Bus is Late”) that was featured on the podcast <a href=""www.commonplacebooks.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i></i></a><i><a href=""http://www.commonplacebooks.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Welcome To Night Vale</a></i>, album art for the Denver-based, folk-punk group <a href=""c-o-x.bandcamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b></b></a><b><a href=""http://c-o-x.bandcamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Creation Order Xtinction</a></b>, a tour poster illustration for punk band <b><a href=""onthecinder.bandcamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://onthecinder.bandcamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">On The Cinder</a> </b>along with art for a song soon-to-be released on their Bandcamp page, the back cover design for the ska-punk trio <a href=""http://seventhirtyseven.bandcamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>Seven Thirty Seven</b></a>’s “A Little Bit of Impatience” CD release, and also merchandise plus mascot illustrations for <b><a href=""accidentals.bandcamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://accidentals.bandcamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Accidentals</a></b>.

This means working with limited budgets, time constraints, and with just the resources that are available within arm’s reach. Often this means not getting paid a lot of money and struggling to make end’s meet, but the genuine appreciation when I deliver the final product is worth it and keeps pushing me forward. To compensate, I’ve started creating merchandise out of my artwork to sell at art markets and at basement shows, but I’m still in the early stages of trying to get back on my feet. I figured out a means to be self-employed, but I don’t have the extra resources I need to get the ball truly rolling. It’s hard to save up money when I’m still trying to recover from almost <b></b><a href=""http://steveardo.tumblr.com/post/104276843985/homecoming-king-part-i"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>6½ long years of being homeless</b></a>. You see, I did graduate from college and earn a BFA, but I was homeless for 4½ years while I attended school and my reward after completing it was a little over 2 years more of not having a permanent address. That long nightmare came to an end in July of 2014 when I finally had an opportunity to move into an apartment, but that didn’t solve all my problems. I have a <b>$800 </b><b>student loan monthly payment from my private lenders</b>, and because of that never-changing number for the next 15 or so years it would be extremely difficult to pool extra money into updating anything I own or be able to “save up” like the majority of other people. With my federal loans it would be a total of <b>$1,100 a month</b>, but since they are currently on an income-based repayment plan I (temporarily) don’t have to worry about them. <b>The grand total of all of my student loans is over $100,000</b>. This frightening amount is with loans alone and not including other luxuries like paying rent and utilities that most people take for granted. Before you question why I chose to pursue my degree <a href=""steveardo.tumblr.com/post/104276843985/homecoming-king-part-i"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b></b></a><b><a href=""http://steveardo.tumblr.com/post/104276843985/homecoming-king-part-i"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I encourage you to again read my backstory</a></b>. The reason why I owe so much back is because my situation is unique; the overwhelmingly massive anxiety and depression due to the death of my father and the physical force my stepfather used against me (that directly lead to my homelessness) prolonged my stay at the University at Buffalo. With no other place to live I had to rely on dorms for a place to stay, and private loans were the only way I could afford to continue attending school. I don’t regret going to college to get my BFA. I overcame so many obstacles and mental illness barriers just to graduate, but I kept pushing myself further because I knew that I could do it. I wanted a brighter future for myself, and to make that happen I <i>needed</i> to have a degree. So even while I live my daily life with this heavy burden and with everything I have been through (and the people I’ve lost), I still have dedicated over 2 years of my life helping others visualize their messages and musical passions through my art.</p>
<p>(<i>Please note: This is not a plea for you to pay off my student loans, nor am I asking for pity with what I’ve endured. My past experiences have shaped me into a strong-willed and determined individual, but they do not define who I am today. All I need is a chance to start my own business so I can be financially independent and shape my own future.)</i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433990927/uuqeukwn479f4v3u6kfw.png"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/></p>

<p>I’m asking for help because no matter how hard I fight it, I finally realized that I can’t do it all by myself. Your contribution not only helps create something that supports fellow DIY-ers, but it also helps out someone who hasn’t had the same opportunities or advantages that his other peers have had. I might have been dealt an unfair hand from the get-go, but I’ve used my experiences to grow stronger as a person and to never give up despite the harsh trials. From what I’ve learned from these past few years and the wonderful community I’ve become apart of is that “do it yourself” doesn’t mean going at it alone.<br/><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Requests &amp; Rewards</h3> <p>My plan for this campaign is simple: I’m building a small business that focuses around the freelance work I’ve already been doing along with continuing to make and sell my own merchandise. This mainly requires technological upgrades, online resources, and acquiring materials that are years overdue and necessary to move forward. Some of what the money will go towards is updating my current software (I’m running Adobe CS5 on a late 2007 MacBook), building a website, and creating an online store. Hardware is integral to creating a business as well. Flyer-making relies a lot on having access to both a scanner and a printer, and I’m currently outfitted with just a scanner that is on its last legs. I silkscreen my own T-shirts by hand and need to be able to buy them in bulk. I am fortunate enough to be able to use the resources available at a local <a href=""www.wnybookarts.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b></b></a><b><a href=""http://www.wnybookarts.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">501(c)3 nonprofit organization</a></b> I volunteered at for over 2½ years to print them, but a future goal is to have my own studio space so I can be entirely self-sufficient. Also in the works is selling T-shirts in local shops on consignment with a line of youth sizes being planned for the near-future. I’m looking to purchase a button maker along with the parts needed to create my own pins. New markers, pencils, and drawing supplies are desperately needed too. Packaging and shipping supplies are also included within the goal after I set up an account with Uline or a similar company. A portion of the money raised will go towards shipping the rewards through the U.S. Postal Service. I am trying to remain active within area art markets as a vendor, so some money will be put aside as well for a new vehicle to replace mine that finally died after 5 long years of dedicated service. I need a vehicle so I can actually transport my wares to and from festivals and events both locally and outside of the area. Anything beyond the goal amount will be used to make this startup a little bit more manageable by being applied to helping ease off my crippling student loans.</p>
<p>Now for the good stuff! The perks will consist of T-shirts, prints, zines, and more featuring my own illustrations. Except for the stickers and posters which I outsource for printing, everything I make for musicians and for my own use is all created by hand in-house. Own some Steve Ardo merchandise before all the other local punks! Perk levels may contain a combination of the following rewards...</p>

It is a place of loving friends who became another family and took me in for 2 months when I was struggling with poverty and homelessness, but had nowhere else to go.

</div>
<p>
My
job is to help musicians create a visual representation of their
dreams and messages, but the meaning behind being a DIY artist is
much deeper than that. Regardless of the challenges that lie before
us, we keep pushing forward because it is genuinely what we love.
Through my long journey I could never have imagined ever being part
of a community that worked so hard to selflessly help one another, and so it is
with great pride that I do everything I can to support these amazing
people through my art. It might looks like a simple T-shirt or flyer for just another punk show to some people, but to these dedicated individuals
what I create means the world to them. It’s a mutual appreciation I
never dreamed could exist, but I’m reminded of it every time I walk
into a show and am immediately embraced by about 50 or so of my friends. My potential to succeed has always been there just waiting to explode,
but I need the right tools and resources to make this a profession
where I can truly work on a level playing field. Helping those in need has
always been my passion, so now is the time to make that dream a
viable reality.<br/><br/></p><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Anyone trying to start a business will face obstacles and problems to solve no matter how ambitious the idea, that’s just how reality works. Obtaining the funding is just the start, obviously. I have the drive and determination, but I would need the knowledge and wisdom on how to operate my business both properly and successfully. Luckily, New York State offers a free service to guide individuals looking to start their own businesses. The <a href=""http://www.nyssbdc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>Small Business Development Center</b></a>’s Buffalo office is about a 15 minute walk from my apartment, and I am already familiar with the staff. I approached them in late 2014 about initially starting this project, but the lack of adequate funds made it impossible to get anything off the ground. Educating myself with everything from copyrighting to tax law is just as important as actually making my art.</p>
<p>Being self-sufficient has always been a personal goal of mine, so I’ve always found it hard to ask others for help. The biggest risk, personally, is acquiring the necessary funding so that I can start this project as soon as possible. The goal I’m working for is basically everything I have been working on for the past 2+ years. None of that will change and musicians will always need artwork, but this is just a chance for this to grow into something much more. I’m extremely experienced as an illustrator and graphic designer, but I’m also experienced with what it means to work hard to survive. No matter what happens, I’m determined to continue to make my art and hone my craft.<br/><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>I understand more than most that sometimes you want to help someone else but you need to prioritize taking care of yourself. If you can’t donate, then please share this page on social media and tell others about what I’m trying to accomplish. For an openly-gay punk artist rapidly closing in on 30, there’s been a lot of obstacles and hardships in my life I’ve had to endure. From homelessness to coming out to the deaths of those most important to me,<b> <a href=""http://steveardo.tumblr.com/tagged/stories/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I have a lot of stories about my life I want to share</a></b>. This project is vital because I’m finally taking a stand and making something out of my life, no matter what trials may come. I’m no longer content with just surviving, I am intent on carving my own path.</p>

You see, I did graduate from college and earn a BFA, but I was homeless for 4½ years while I attended school and my reward after completing it was a little over 2 years more of not having a permanent address. That long nightmare came to an end in July of 2014 when I finally had an opportunity to move into an apartment, but that didn’t solve all my problems. I have a $800 student loan monthly payment from my private lenders, and because of that never-changing number for the next 15 or so years it would be extremely difficult to pool extra money into updating anything I own or be able to “save up” like the majority of other people. With my federal loans it would be a total of $1,100 a month, but since they are currently on an income-based repayment plan I (temporarily) don’t have to worry about them. The grand total of all of my student loans is over $100,000. This frightening amount is with loans alone and not including other luxuries like paying rent and utilities that most people take for granted. Before you question why I chose to pursue my degree I encourage you to again read my backstory. The reason why I owe so much back is because my situation is unique; the overwhelmingly massive anxiety and depression due to the death of my father and the physical force my stepfather used against me (that directly lead to my homelessness) prolonged my stay at the University at Buffalo. With no other place to live I had to rely on dorms for a place to stay, and private loans were the only way I could afford to continue attending school. I don’t regret going to college to get my BFA. I overcame so many obstacles and mental illness barriers just to graduate, but I kept pushing myself further because I knew that I could do it. I wanted a brighter future for myself, and to make that happen I needed to have a degree. So even while I live my daily life with this heavy burden and with everything I have been through (and the people I’ve lost), I still have dedicated over 2 years of my life helping others visualize their messages and musical passions through my art.
(Please note: This is not a plea for you to pay off my student loans, nor am I asking for pity with what I’ve endured. My past experiences have shaped me into a strong-willed and determined individual, but they do not define who I am today. All I need is a chance to start my own business so I can be financially independent and shape my own future.)

I’m asking for help because no matter how hard I fight it, I finally realized that I can’t do it all by myself. Your contribution not only helps create something that supports fellow DIY-ers, but it also helps out someone who hasn’t had the same opportunities or advantages that his other peers have had. I might have been dealt an unfair hand from the get-go, but I’ve used my experiences to grow stronger as a person and to never give up despite the harsh trials. From what I’ve learned from these past few years and the wonderful community I’ve become apart of is that “do it yourself” doesn’t mean going at it alone.   Requests & Rewards My plan for this campaign is simple: I’m building a small business that focuses around the freelance work I’ve already been doing along with continuing to make and sell my own merchandise. This mainly requires technological upgrades, online resources, and acquiring materials that are years overdue and necessary to move forward. Some of what the money will go towards is updating my current software (I’m running Adobe CS5 on a late 2007 MacBook), building a website, and creating an online store. Hardware is integral to creating a business as well. Flyer-making relies a lot on having access to both a scanner and a printer, and I’m currently outfitted with just a scanner that is on its last legs. I silkscreen my own T-shirts by hand and need to be able to buy them in bulk. I am fortunate enough to be able to use the resources available at a local 501(c)3 nonprofit organization I volunteered at for over 2½ years to print them, but a future goal is to have my own studio space so I can be entirely self-sufficient. Also in the works is selling T-shirts in local shops on consignment with a line of youth sizes being planned for the near-future. I’m looking to purchase a button maker along with the parts needed to create my own pins. New markers, pencils, and drawing supplies are desperately needed too. Packaging and shipping supplies are also included within the goal after I set up an account with Uline or a similar company. A portion of the money raised will go towards shipping the rewards through the U.S. Postal Service. I am trying to remain active within area art markets as a vendor, so some money will be put aside as well for a new vehicle to replace mine that finally died after 5 long years of dedicated service. I need a vehicle so I can actually transport my wares to and from festivals and events both locally and outside of the area. Anything beyond the goal amount will be used to make this startup a little bit more manageable by being applied to helping ease off my crippling student loans.
Now for the good stuff! The perks will consist of T-shirts, prints, zines, and more featuring my own illustrations. Except for the stickers and posters which I outsource for printing, everything I make for musicians and for my own use is all created by hand in-house. Own some Steve Ardo merchandise before all the other local punks! Perk levels may contain a combination of the following rewards...
Stickers!

Crack and peel stickers in various sizes using illustrations from past flyers and some original designs. “Rad-o-saurus Rex”, which is printed with a UV vinyl coating, will be the primary sticker available in both the Buffalo (hand)Bills and Local Punk levels. The other designs are gloss-coated and will only be available in the Local Punk package.
“Buffalo (hand)Bills” Zines!

Two 5.5"" x 8.5"" zines that serve as a collection of a year’s worth of hand-drawn flyers and handbills for punk shows in Buffalo. “Volume I” (2013) contains just the titles of the flyers while “Volume II” (2014) details the stories behind the designs as well as what the shows were about. Please note that the zines do contain mild profanity and alcohol references, they were created for punk shows after all! 
“Party Monster” Giclée Poster!
Based on the flyer for On The Cinder’s first tour of Summer 2014, James T. Gilbert (aka the “Party Monster”) has since became a favorite of the public and appears on T-shirts, pins, and stickers. These 11"" x 17"" posters are on 14 pt., gloss cover stock.
Brand New “Follow Your Heart!” T-ShirtA re-imagined version of a drawing I made for Hallwalls Contemporary Arts Center’s “A Mid-Winter’s Draw” fundraiser back in February, this cute guy will be printed on 100% Pre-Shrunk Ringspun (fitted) T-shirts in turquoise from Delta Apparel in unisex adult sizes. “Follow your heart” is the motto of The Flower House, a music venue where we organized basement shows, but more importantly as a temporary home. It is a place of loving friends who became another family and took me in for 2 months when I was struggling with poverty and homelessness, but had nowhere else to go. The meaning behind this philosophy is to choose your own path in life with no regrets while doing what makes you truly happy. Only you can decide what that might be, no one else can do that.

Our Impact
 


My
job is to help musicians create a visual representation of their
dreams and messages, but the meaning behind being a DIY artist is
much deeper than that. Regardless of the challenges that lie before
us, we keep pushing forward because it is genuinely what we love.
Through my long journey I could never have imagined ever being part
of a community that worked so hard to selflessly help one another, and so it is
with great pride that I do everything I can to support these amazing
people through my art. It might looks like a simple T-shirt or flyer for just another punk show to some people, but to these dedicated individuals
what I create means the world to them. It’s a mutual appreciation I
never dreamed could exist, but I’m reminded of it every time I walk
into a show and am immediately embraced by about 50 or so of my friends. My potential to succeed has always been there just waiting to explode,
but I need the right tools and resources to make this a profession
where I can truly work on a level playing field. Helping those in need has
always been my passion, so now is the time to make that dream a
viable reality.
Risks & Challenges Anyone trying to start a business will face obstacles and problems to solve no matter how ambitious the idea, that’s just how reality works. Obtaining the funding is just the start, obviously. I have the drive and determination, but I would need the knowledge and wisdom on how to operate my business both properly and successfully. Luckily, New York State offers a free service to guide individuals looking to start their own businesses. The Small Business Development Center’s Buffalo office is about a 15 minute walk from my apartment, and I am already familiar with the staff. I approached them in late 2014 about initially starting this project, but the lack of adequate funds made it impossible to get anything off the ground. Educating myself with everything from copyrighting to tax law is just as important as actually making my art.
Being self-sufficient has always been a personal goal of mine, so I’ve always found it hard to ask others for help. The biggest risk, personally, is acquiring the necessary funding so that I can start this project as soon as possible. The goal I’m working for is basically everything I have been working on for the past 2+ years. None of that will change and musicians will always need artwork, but this is just a chance for this to grow into something much more. I’m extremely experienced as an illustrator and graphic designer, but I’m also experienced with what it means to work hard to survive. No matter what happens, I’m determined to continue to make my art and hone my craft.   Other Ways You Can Help I understand more than most that sometimes you want to help someone else but you need to prioritize taking care of yourself. If you can’t donate, then please share this page on social media and tell others about what I’m trying to accomplish. For an openly-gay punk artist rapidly closing in on 30, there’s been a lot of obstacles and hardships in my life I’ve had to endure. From homelessness to coming out to the deaths of those most important to me, I have a lot of stories about my life I want to share. This project is vital because I’m finally taking a stand and making something out of my life, no matter what trials may come. I’m no longer content with just surviving, I am intent on carving my own path.",7.0,0,"2 Campaigns

King.  The beverage  was originally sold to friends and family in the Liberian (Monrovia, Liberia) community for special events and family functions.  Growing up, the punch was the best kept secret with a precious few aware of how to actually make it.  Adeline King passed away on June 19, 2007, leaving behind 2 daughters and many grandchildren.  On December 27, 20ll, after being unemployed for 2 years, I, Adima E. Aniteye, a granddaugther of Adeline M. King decided to bottle my grandmother's famous punch.  I named the company A.M.

<p>Though this beverage is made for anyone to consume, one of the best ways to enjoy these beverages are with spirits.  At this stage I am ready to add alcohol to the original flavor, The Queen, and the spirit of choice is rum.  </p>
<p>I will be opening a distillery in order to make a rum based bottled beverage as well as distilling my own brand of rum.  </p>
<p>Aside from the actual distillation process, this is easier said than 
done.  As I work on getting the distillery up and running, I 
will be outsourcing the rum in the mean time in order to launch a line 
of punch with the rum included called Q.V.I.R Punch.  This is where you

<p>I will need $12,000 to complete this process in order to get the product on the shelves by the end of the summer while perfecting my rum recipe.  The breakdown of funds is as follows:</p>
<p><br/></p>Acquiring rum in bulk--$3000<br/>Labels--$1300<br/>Bottles--$3000<br/>Ingredients for juices--$1500<br/>Practice still--$800<br/>First distillation ingredients--$900<br/>Campaign fees and perks--$1500<br/><br/>If I am not able to acquire this amount, what I do obtain will go towards the rum in bulk, bottles, and labels in order to pitch to the Alcohol Beverage Control (ABC) board in the beginning of April.  ABC is the only outlet for spirits in the Commonwealth of Virginia.<br/><br/>For your contribution, we have some exciting perks for you as you join our team in a very special way!!<br/><br/>Personalized Social Media ""Thank yous""<br/>Queen Victoria Vino Protector<br/>Queen Victoria Shot glasses<br/>Queen Victoria T-Shirts<br/>Queen Victoria Grace Lunch Cooler<br/>Queen Victoria's Rum Cake<br/>Bottles of juice (any flavor of your choice)<br/>Bottles of Q.V.I.R punch<br/>Bottles of Q.V.I.R pure spirit out of the first distillation<br/>Honorary Plaque on the walls of Queen Victoria's Distillery<br/>Links to your business on Queen Victoria's website<br/><br/>

<p>Currently, I am moving the operation to a commercial facility.  The move is financially taxing and any remaining funds are going toward keeping the normal operations going as the company takes on overhead expenses.  In order to launch the new product, your contribution will allow us to go to the next level and distribute more of the product, which it would not be able to do without your help.</p>
<p>This growth will also allow me to create jobs as well as break into a very exclusive industry, ironically, with the help of the public.  There are currently no distilleries in Virginia that are solely female owned so we would definitely be breaking a few glass ceilings!</p>

<p>Incorporating alcohol into the product and company is proving to be quite a challenge.  Very few make it through the process and it seems like the industry has a secret network of those who are ""making it"".  As one of the few minority, female run distilleries in the country (if any), it has been difficult to find someone blazing this trail with me.  I am asking you to believe in bringing back the idea of ""just a good drink"".  Carefully crafted cocktails and spirits are controlled by the ""big guys"" and with such grueling state and federal regulations the ""little guys"" find it hard to maneuver through the process, but with a crowd behind us.......I'm not worried.  Your investment will allow me to focus on creating a quality light, white, rum right here in the United States that will be competitive with that of the West Indies.</p>

<p>As a pre-medical student at The College of William &amp; Mary, I gained 
extensive experience in chemistry, specifically the process of 
distillation.  Years later, I became a bartender in Washington DC where 
my knowledge of spirits and blends was greatly expanded. </p>
<p>After living in Miami, Florida for a year and working at Epic Hotel/restaurant I gained even more knowledge of distilled spirits, particularly rum, not knowing at the time how it would impact my decisions on my business almost 5 years later!</p>
<p>With these 
attributes in my background, I thought, why not just distill and make 
the rum myself?<br/></p>
<p>My grandmother taught me well, in addition to my education, work experience, and just life in general, I am able to overcome any obstacle and get this company to where it needs to be, and with your help.....WE can do it that much quicker, and make history at the same time!<br/></p>

will be outsourcing the rum in the mean time in order to launch a line 
of punch with the rum included called Q.V.I.R Punch.  This is where you 
come in!




I will need $12,000 to complete this process in order to get the product on the shelves by the end of the summer while perfecting my rum recipe.  The breakdown of funds is as follows:
Acquiring rum in bulk--$3000Labels--$1300Bottles--$3000Ingredients for juices--$1500Practice still--$800First distillation ingredients--$900Campaign fees and perks--$1500If I am not able to acquire this amount, what I do obtain will go towards the rum in bulk, bottles, and labels in order to pitch to the Alcohol Beverage Control (ABC) board in the beginning of April.  ABC is the only outlet for spirits in the Commonwealth of Virginia.For your contribution, we have some exciting perks for you as you join our team in a very special way!!Personalized Social Media ""Thank yous""Queen Victoria Vino ProtectorQueen Victoria Shot glassesQueen Victoria T-ShirtsQueen Victoria Grace Lunch CoolerQueen Victoria's Rum CakeBottles of juice (any flavor of your choice)Bottles of Q.V.I.R punchBottles of Q.V.I.R pure spirit out of the first distillationHonorary Plaque on the walls of Queen Victoria's DistilleryLinks to your business on Queen Victoria's website
  The Impact
Currently, I am moving the operation to a commercial facility.  The move is financially taxing and any remaining funds are going toward keeping the normal operations going as the company takes on overhead expenses.  In order to launch the new product, your contribution will allow us to go to the next level and distribute more of the product, which it would not be able to do without your help.
This growth will also allow me to create jobs as well as break into a very exclusive industry, ironically, with the help of the public.  There are currently no distilleries in Virginia that are solely female owned so we would definitely be breaking a few glass ceilings!




Any investment is a great opportunity for us to launch Q.V.I.R Punch, and extend our love of a great drink to many more!
    Risks & Challenges
Incorporating alcohol into the product and company is proving to be quite a challenge.  Very few make it through the process and it seems like the industry has a secret network of those who are ""making it"".  As one of the few minority, female run distilleries in the country (if any), it has been difficult to find someone blazing this trail with me.  I am asking you to believe in bringing back the idea of ""just a good drink"".  Carefully crafted cocktails and spirits are controlled by the ""big guys"" and with such grueling state and federal regulations the ""little guys"" find it hard to maneuver through the process, but with a crowd behind us.......I'm not worried.  Your investment will allow me to focus on creating a quality light, white, rum right here in the United States that will be competitive with that of the West Indies.


About Me


As a pre-medical student at The College of William & Mary, I gained 
extensive experience in chemistry, specifically the process of 
distillation.  Years later, I became a bartender in Washington DC where 
my knowledge of spirits and blends was greatly expanded. 
After living in Miami, Florida for a year and working at Epic Hotel/restaurant I gained even more knowledge of distilled spirits, particularly rum, not knowing at the time how it would impact my decisions on my business almost 5 years later!
With these 
attributes in my background, I thought, why not just distill and make 
the rum myself?
My grandmother taught me well, in addition to my education, work experience, and just life in general, I am able to overcome any obstacle and get this company to where it needs to be, and with your help.....WE can do it that much quicker, and make history at the same time!
  Other Ways You Can Help
Any help you can give us while we grow our product line of Queen Victoria goodies, whether that is by sharing the campaign on social media, talking about it, or contributing monetary funds would be greatly appreciated and rewarded!! Cheers!",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

We have been opened for three short years, and are currently educating 220 children. We are also providing jobs for over one hundred adults in this community each day, giving hope to families for a brighter future. Through education and job opportunity, Hope Haven is empowering the Murindi community to move beyond the past, break the cycle of poverty, and rise up economically, intellectually, and spiritually as an educated people.</p><p>Poverty is the norm, and work is scarce in Murindi, so parents find it difficult to pay the school fees charged by Hope Haven, of between $5 -$10 each month, for their child. (The true cost of education at Hope Haven is $120 additional each month.) At Hope Haven, mothers are empowered through jobs and education as well. They make up most of the jobs in construction, permaculture and sustaining the campus. This income changes the dynamics in the home as well as paying for education.</p><p>A mother’s greatest blessing is her children, so this campaign is dedicated to raising $50,000 to send more than thirty children in the community to school for a whole year. The education that these students will receive is quality. The lead curriculum is from McGraw-Hill, which works in concert with a modern computer lab, and phenomenal teachers. Hope Haven understands that education is the key to future success in Rwanda. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1353136/files/20150403141023-Mural-Artist.png?1428095423"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""/></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">For this campaign, Hope Haven has partnered with Rwandan artist, Pacifique Niyonsenga to create a mural to honor mothers everywhere!

<div>
<div>
<div>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The Squidlle project started because of a dirty social media feed. I was sick of seeing my feed filling up with political propaganda and other unpleasant things, so I contacted a few friends, who, not surprisingly had the same feelings of frustration, and decided to do something about it. </span><br/></p>
<div>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
<div></div>After many tired nights slaving over whiteboards and piles of paper drawings, Squidlle started to take shape. <b>We realized that Social Media was out of control</b>, and had come up with the first ideas for developing a platform to fix it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<p>                                        <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1328690/files/20150326104758-avatar_big-fb.png?1427392078"" src="""" style=""width: 306.486486486486px; height: 180px;""/></p>
<div><br/></div>First, we created a basic design concept. Making sure that it would be simple while keeping usability in mind.</div>
<div>
<br/>
<div>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1235202/files/20150220015339-Sketch1.png?1424426019"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/><br/>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">After several variations of the original concept we began incorporating the features we had brainstormed, while keeping it as fit and user friendly as possible.</span><br/>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1294538/files/20150314101957-sketch-5.jpg?1426353597"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<div>We tried several architecture models for the platform and decided on the best one for the highest productivity. </div>
<div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1216485/files/20150212043618-Architecture.png?1423744578"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<div>
<p></p>
<div>Then we began developing a way to make this into a reality <b>without selling the product to people who would just turn it into another out-of-control platform</b>.<p></p>
<p>That lead us here to Indiegogo. We know that this is the best way to make Squidlle a reality. It has been a very fun journey up until now, and we hope to keep going further to bring this product to the market. We can't do it without your help, will you join us in making a better online experience?</p>
</div>
<p><b>Who are we?</b></p>
<p>We’re an independent company that believes in innovation through collaboration. What makes us completely different than any other company is you are dealing with a group of people just like you. We are enthusiasts that want to improve our technologies and help build real products better for the user, and not for the sake of scaling a platform. <b>Will you help us bring Squidlle to life?</b></p>

The Journey Behind Squidlle             




The Squidlle project started because of a dirty social media feed. I was sick of seeing my feed filling up with political propaganda and other unpleasant things, so I contacted a few friends, who, not surprisingly had the same feelings of frustration, and decided to do something about it. 




After many tired nights slaving over whiteboards and piles of paper drawings, Squidlle started to take shape. We realized that Social Media was out of control, and had come up with the first ideas for developing a platform to fix it.


                                        
First, we created a basic design concept. Making sure that it would be simple while keeping usability in mind.







After several variations of the original concept we began incorporating the features we had brainstormed, while keeping it as fit and user friendly as possible.



We tried several architecture models for the platform and decided on the best one for the highest productivity. 



Then we began developing a way to make this into a reality without selling the product to people who would just turn it into another out-of-control platform.
That lead us here to Indiegogo. We know that this is the best way to make Squidlle a reality. It has been a very fun journey up until now, and we hope to keep going further to bring this product to the market. We can't do it without your help, will you join us in making a better online experience?

Who are we?
We’re an independent company that believes in innovation through collaboration. What makes us completely different than any other company is you are dealing with a group of people just like you. We are enthusiasts that want to improve our technologies and help build real products better for the user, and not for the sake of scaling a platform. Will you help us bring Squidlle to life?

<p>While we love our subterranean space in downtown Ithaca, we realized that we would like a larger gathering space for the Bandwagon community to congregate, brew beer, and grow ingredients for our food and beer.  For over a year we have been renovating a beautiful 1850s barn, which sits on about 6 acres.

</h3> <p>Loaves
and Fishes Food Bank is a non-profit in Nanaimo that has helped the hungry get back on
their feet for the last sixteen years.   The work continues, but the biggest challenge now
is space. There's not enough room to store and distribute the tons of food
given out each year. It's in part the price of success.   <b>Every month we source and distribute over $120,000 worth of food.   Food is distributed at 10 different locations and made possible by the work of over 480 volunteers.  Additionally, food is provided free of charge to over 30 other non profits in the Nanaimo area. </b></p>
<p>We have turned
food retailers into partners - We now pick up pick up perishable food that retailers are throwing out through our Food 4U Food Recovery Program.  95% of this food is still good, so we are able to provide much better nutrition, while at the same time dramatically reducing food waste in our community.  This means better
nutrition, bigger hampers and a desperate need
for more space.   The 5% of food that is not suitable for human consumption is provided to local chicken, pig and cow farmers as well as a rabbit rescue.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">All of this activity has been conducted out of a warehouse that is less than 500 square feet.  Volunteers often have had to work outside to make this work.  We need a significantly bigger warehouse to handle the increase in food coming in.   </span></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>
<b>We need $550,000 to purchase and renovate a new warehouse at 210 Fry Street.</b>  A purchase price of $425,000 has been negotiated and we anticipate another $125,000 in improvements (walk in cooler, roofing upgrades, loading bay paving, washrooms)  <b>We have raised $365,000 so far: $275,000 from the City of Nanaimo, $50,000 for the Nanaimo Port Authority and $40,000 in private donations.</b>
</div>
<div><b>We are seeking to raise $50,000 through Indiegogo to help cover the current $185,000 short fall.  </b></div>

</div><div> <p>A new warehouse will positively impact our operations in 4 significant ways:</p>
<p>1.) <span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Currently we have 5 grocery stores participating in our Food 4U Food Recovery Program.  With a new </span>warehouse<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> we will be able to invite other stores to </span>participate<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> in this </span>innovative<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> program as we will have room to handle the food.  <b>This will result in increased food for food bank clients and the agencies we serve.</b></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">2.) A new warehouse will enable us to use our current property at 1009 Farquhar Street strictly for distribution to clients.  This will mean we can<b> increase the hours we are open to clients from the current 16 hours a week to over 30 hours a week.</b></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">3.)  With our current facility being used only for </span>distribution,<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> we will be able to set up a system where </span>clients<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> can choose each item they </span>receive<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">.  <b>Rather than being given a bag of food, people could pick the food that meets their </b></span><b>preferences and dietary needs.  </b></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">4.) <b>Food will not have to be stored outside under tarps, nor will volunteers and staff won't have to work outside to ensure food is ready for clients.  Clients will be able to pick food up inside instead of outside under tents and awnings.  </b></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></span></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>The new warehouse will be the most significant change in our infrastructure in our history.  As such it presents significant operational challenges.  These challenges include moving food, staff and volunteers between 2 locations and ensuring we are able to communicate clearly between the two sites.  Fortunately the 2 locations are less than a 2 minute walk apart.  We have found that VHF radios work well for communicating between the two locations.  $2400 worth of radios have been donated for this purpose.</div>
<div>Additional expenses will be incurred with the new warehouse.   We anticipate our monthly expenses going from $32,000 per month to $38,000 per month ($72,000 per year).  To compensate for this increase we have applied for gaming funds to help pay wages.  This application has been approved and we now have $50,000 to pay wages that we did not have before.  This means that funds we had to pay wages can now be applied to the operating expenses of the new warehouse.  This leaves $22,000 annually that needs to be fund raised to cover expenses.  We intend to solicit donations form the public as well as initiate an annual ""signature event"" to cover these additional expenses.  </div> <p><br/></p>

It's in part the price of success.   Every month we source and distribute over $120,000 worth of food.   Food is distributed at 10 different locations and made possible by the work of over 480 volunteers.  Additionally, food is provided free of charge to over 30 other non profits in the Nanaimo area. 
We have turned
food retailers into partners - We now pick up pick up perishable food that retailers are throwing out through our Food 4U Food Recovery Program.  95% of this food is still good, so we are able to provide much better nutrition, while at the same time dramatically reducing food waste in our community.  This means better
nutrition, bigger hampers and a desperate need
for more space.   The 5% of food that is not suitable for human consumption is provided to local chicken, pig and cow farmers as well as a rabbit rescue.
All of this activity has been conducted out of a warehouse that is less than 500 square feet.  Volunteers often have had to work outside to make this work.  We need a significantly bigger warehouse to handle the increase in food coming in.      What We Need & What You Get

We need $550,000 to purchase and renovate a new warehouse at 210 Fry Street.  A purchase price of $425,000 has been negotiated and we anticipate another $125,000 in improvements (walk in cooler, roofing upgrades, loading bay paving, washrooms)  We have raised $365,000 so far: $275,000 from the City of Nanaimo, $50,000 for the Nanaimo Port Authority and $40,000 in private donations.

We are seeking to raise $50,000 through Indiegogo to help cover the current $185,000 short fall.  
Contributions of $30 or more will receive a ""Loaves and Fishes Supporter Fridge Magnet.
Contributions of $150 or More will receive a ""Loaves and Fishes Supporter Fridge Magnet and a Loaves and Fishes Supporter T-shirt.
Contributions of $500 or More will receive a ""Loaves and Fishes Supporter Fridge Magnet, a Loaves and Fishes Supporter T-shirt and a plaque with their name on it  The Impact
 A new warehouse will positively impact our operations in 4 significant ways:
1.) Currently we have 5 grocery stores participating in our Food 4U Food Recovery Program.  With a new warehouse we will be able to invite other stores to participate in this innovative program as we will have room to handle the food.  This will result in increased food for food bank clients and the agencies we serve.
2.) A new warehouse will enable us to use our current property at 1009 Farquhar Street strictly for distribution to clients.  This will mean we can increase the hours we are open to clients from the current 16 hours a week to over 30 hours a week.
3.)  With our current facility being used only for distribution, we will be able to set up a system where clients can choose each item they receive.  Rather than being given a bag of food, people could pick the food that meets their preferences and dietary needs.  
4.) Food will not have to be stored outside under tarps, nor will volunteers and staff won't have to work outside to ensure food is ready for clients.  Clients will be able to pick food up inside instead of outside under tents and awnings.  

    Risks & Challenges
The new warehouse will be the most significant change in our infrastructure in our history.  As such it presents significant operational challenges.  These challenges include moving food, staff and volunteers between 2 locations and ensuring we are able to communicate clearly between the two sites.  Fortunately the 2 locations are less than a 2 minute walk apart.  We have found that VHF radios work well for communicating between the two locations.  $2400 worth of radios have been donated for this purpose.
Additional expenses will be incurred with the new warehouse.   We anticipate our monthly expenses going from $32,000 per month to $38,000 per month ($72,000 per year).  To compensate for this increase we have applied for gaming funds to help pay wages.  This application has been approved and we now have $50,000 to pay wages that we did not have before.  This means that funds we had to pay wages can now be applied to the operating expenses of the new warehouse.  This leaves $22,000 annually that needs to be fund raised to cover expenses.  We intend to solicit donations form the public as well as initiate an annual ""signature event"" to cover these additional expenses.   
    Other Ways You Can Help Beyond contributing to this campaign please consider the following ways to support Loaves and Fishes:
1.)  Volunteer.  Orientation happens on the first Wednesday of the Month at 3:00 pm and the 3rd Monday of the month at 7:30 pm.  Please see our website for more info. 
2.) Come for a tour and see the work we do.  Call 250 754 8347 ext 222 to book a tour.
3.) Share this campaign with your friends.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My Name is Ross and I am starting this in order to help me change my career.</p>
<p>I am here at Indiegogo to ask for help to upscale my current hobby as a Quail enthusiast into a full blown Quail Farmer! I have invested all I have into this venture and what I am asking for is what I'll need to get me over the hump.</p>
<p>I plan on bringing Quail Eggs as well as a long list of locally and Organically Grown Produce to the immediate local market. Quail eggs are considered a Super Food because they are packed full of nutrients &amp; have many healthy healing properties to them.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>I am asking
for a total sum of 5000.00 so that I can turn my dream into a reality. I am a
small local food producer and I want to make this my full time career. </p>
<p>It has been a hobby of mine for the past 5
years producing food and selling it in my local market. During this time I have
developed a market base and provided an education about food with my customers.
</p>
<p>I am a Permaculturalist
and all of my methods are organic healthy and ethical. Whether it's one of my quail or
chicken eggs or a head of lettuce everything I grow is given the utmost care
and respect. That way it will be the very best for your table and most
importantly your body.</p>
<p>I am passionate about bringing
Whole Healthy Food to as many people as I possibly can. I have done my market
research at this point and have received orders for product that I cannot fulfill
without growing my current operation. I know that whole healthy LOCAL food is
what the people want, and I know this is what our planet needs for healing to
begin.</p>
<p>We are ""food sick"" as a
society - allergies are on the rise and intolerance to Gluten are just 2 of the
many things that people are suffering from. We need to take a step back and
take a long hard look at what we are putting into our bodies. The food we are
being fed is more ""food like"" than actual food and I want to change
that.</p>
<p>If you believe
fundamentally in what I believe, which is: “Change starts with one, and grows
from there”, then please pledge what you can in order to help me achieve my
dream in bringing healthy, REAL food to the local market</p>
<p>The funds will be used to build quail hutches to house more quail in order to keep up with the overwhelming demand.
The funds will also go toward the rental of equipment in order to make more
Organic Hugel Beds for production of Organic produce.</p>
<br/> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>By making a
donation to my Campaign it will give a boost to healthy local food. I started
raising pastured poultry 3 years ago and the community has embraced it to the
point that I am growing the maximum amount of free range table chickens currently
allowed to be grown by a private producer in accordance to the Ontario Chicken Board.</p>

to the next level both in infrastructure and personal growth. We need to return
to the past in order to fix our future.</span><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>Some of the

as well.  </p>

is that Quail feel right at home being game birds in a forested natural
setting.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>

<h3>Why This Campaign Is Important To Me<br/>
</h3>I was personally affected by a collection agency in a small claims lawsuit. I wanted to defend myself so I did countless hours of research.  In the process I learned an invaluable about consumer rights I never knew I had. I also uncovered most collection agencies operate under complete and utter deception and get away with it which makes and still makes me sick. I discovered many collection agencies can't provide information which proves you owe them anything! If you write them asking for information and they can't provide it they legally are obligated to remove or delete it from your credit report!<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1129583/files/20150103155731-1.jpg?1420329451"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p></p>
<h3>Collection Agencies Breaking the Law</h3>
I wanted to test the collection agencies to see if they were indeed violating the law. I pulled up my credit report and discovered several collection agencies were reporting on it. I wrote the collection agencies challenging the debts. The collection agencies could not respond with proof showing I owed them anything. In return, the collection agencies stopped collection activity and deleted the entry's from my credit report completely. <b>This confirmed to me that most collection agencies are nothing but a complete and utter racket taking advantage of people who don't know their rights.</b><br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1129584/files/20150103155812-4.jpg?1420329492"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

I'm very passionate about this once in a lifetime opportunity to turn my business venture into a reality.  As a entrepreneur I could not think of a better business to start because I'm very passionate about protecting people against corporate greed fueled by most collection agencies. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1129586/files/20150103155856-3.png?1420329536"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><br/><h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
With every business venture there are challenges but I don't for see any 
dramatic obstacles that we can't overcome. One challenge would be not 
getting enough customers per month to make a profit. I don't believe that will be a problem because I've been getting interest on Facebook challenging friends debts and proof of them being removed on our Facebook page. After a year of being established I I don't foresee a problem generating funds because simply because our proven method of operation. <br/><br/><p></p>

I'm very passionate about this once in a lifetime opportunity to turn my business venture into a reality.  As a entrepreneur I could not think of a better business to start because I'm very passionate about protecting people against corporate greed fueled by most collection agencies. 
Risks and challenges
With every business venture there are challenges but I don't for see any 
dramatic obstacles that we can't overcome. One challenge would be not 
getting enough customers per month to make a profit. I don't believe that will be a problem because I've been getting interest on Facebook challenging friends debts and proof of them being removed on our Facebook page. After a year of being established I I don't foresee a problem generating funds because simply because our proven method of operation. 

I need funding for Phase 1 of the business


1 Year Prepaid - Bond insurance for $25,000 with the State of Wisconsin (quite expensive)! $3400 rounded up per year. 

License to practice consumer credit disputes in the State of Wisconsin. $100 for a 2 year license.

Legal representation to obtain proper legal documents and 
contracts necessary to operate at 110% compliance the law. Including but not limited to power of attorney forms and legal advise and guidance. $8000 needed right before we start fighting for consumer rights.




Cloud based software so our customers can log in 24/7 to track changes 
on their credit reports. In addition our customers will be able to send 
us messages,  keep track of payments and be able to update services from any computer, tablet, or smartphone. The fee for this service is
 approximately $2200 per year. 

Many small extras that add up fast such as a website to bring in additional clientele, business computer, monitor, being listed in the yellow pages and the list goes on from there. $5,000.
Plus an $1300 for campaign fees and other miscellaneous expenses.

<i>Version 1.0 website splash image</i><br/><br/>
<p>We started developing ScreenTag back in 2012, with the vision to offer a seamless way to replace paper-based printed business cards and bring this most basic form of advertising and personal communication to the digital era.</p>
<p>v. 1.0 aired in October of that year. V. 2.0 came about a year later in the form of a mobile web app. However, our user metrics showed that this was not useful. So we started researching about how ScreenTag would be easy to use and fast. Our user research showed that users prefer something readily available upon switching on their phones; and this is how we ended up with v. 3.0.</p>
<p>
For v. 3.0 we re-configured our servers and file system to make our QR codes super readable even with screens under 3 inches, secured easy delivery system without relying solely on e-mail messages, we re-built our ordering system making it easily accessible even on mobile devices and secured flexible and more secure storage that can host up to 9,000,000 ScreenTags. What is missing, is only a back system to interconnect all those components together. And this is where you get in, since our available funds are not enough to cover the cost.</p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1229893/files/20150217202904-557309_490474907632393_1030512154_n_1_.jpg?1424233744"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Actually, we roughly need £2,000 - that's the net campaign target of £2,500 - to get the back office system up and running. This will cut to half the time needed to get a ScreenTag up and running and will eliminate delivery notification failures. This covers the minimum requirements to get the new version of the ScreenTag aired. <br/>
<p>Any amount we get over our campaign target will go towards adding more features to the ScreenTag service:</p>
<p><b>- at £3,500</b> secure end-to-end connection through SSL encryption will be added, making your contact details more secure</p>
<p><b>- at £7,000</b> CDN will be activated making it super fast for your recipients to receive your contact details</p>
<p><b>- at £15,000</b> installation will get automated through a native app for the three most popular smartphone platforms (Android, iOS and Windows)</p>
<p><b>- at 25,000</b> ScreenTag will get its own QR code reading native app (for Android and iOS), rather than relying on third party reading apps<br/></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><b>- at £50,000</b> a companion native app will be developed for the three most popular smartphone platforms (Android, iOS and Windows), for those who like changing their lockscreen and startscreen backgrounds often (or they simply don't want their contact details available in their lockscreen or startscreen - yes, there are those people too...)</p>
<p>Reaching the £50,000 stretch goal within the campaign period - so, this does not cover the InDemand campaign - will also allow us to reduce the ScreenTag annual subscription fees by 20% at £4 - $4 - €4. <b>Everyone wins!</b><br/></p>

<p><b>Q: Does ScreenTag support other languages than English?</b></p>

information can be found on the internet.  However, tangible and practical

<h3 style=""color: #ff0000;"">A Few Facts</h3>
<p>More than half a million patents are filed <i>each year</i> with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and over
300,000 patents are actually granted. 
Over time, that adds up to millions upon millions of patented
inventions.  So, where are these
inventions anyway?  Some of these
inventions and patents are owned by big corporations and a few others you will
see on store shelves.  Where are the rest
of the millions of great ideas?  These
inventions are owned by individual inventors and small companies who are trying
very hard to market their product(s) and sell them locally, nationally or
globally.  Many of these great ideas are
sitting in attics,  basements, and garages
collecting dust because the inventor has run out of resources.  </p>
<p>Keep in mind that inventions are created and patented around the world.  The United States is
just a small portion of the real number of inventors and inventions.</p>
<p>A few sample patent years of the United States are shown below:</p>

contacts to make it happen?  Wouldn't it
be great to have a way to showcase those inventions, sell them, connect with
other inventors, partner with professional resources, and find salespeople to
make your dream come true without being taken advantage of by big money
corporations?</p>
<p>You've seen those commercials on TV promising that they will take
your great idea and turn it into millions of dollars.  The truth is only a <i>very</i> tiny fraction of inventions actually become successful enough through
a third party company to make the inventor any money at all.  Have you ever met anyone who has actually been
successful through a third-party company? 
Of course not.  It rarely happens
to anyone.</p>
<p>What's worse is that <b><i>if</i></b> these companies actually do
accept your idea and develop it, they in return will take a large equity
ownership of the product or company. 
This leaves the inventor and/or entrepreneur with little or no control over
his/her company or idea and the majority of revenue produced by the product
going to the investing company - not the inventor.</p>
<p>What if inventors of the past did not have the resources, business
savvy, networking opportunities or marketing skills to get their products into
the marketplace?  Where would we be today
without rubber, transistors, plastics, sewing machines, internet, etc.  The list goes on and on.  There are so many inventions that are solving
many of the world's problems and they are in jeopardy of a premature death...unless we can mix things up a bit.</p>

<p>At <b><a href=""www.inventionintention.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">InventionIntention.com</a></b>,
we have developed a platform which enables inventors to keep total control over their products while they showcase their invention, connect with retailers and wholesalers, find
quality professional resources, interact with other inventors, partner with
investors, and sell to the general public. 
Inventors may even find talented salespeople who can sell their
inventions in locations never dreamed of by the inventor generating income for both!</p>
<p><b>We do not invest in or take
control or equity of any product, idea, or company.</b>  Our purpose is to provide
an environment where inventors can show what they do best and make connections
and business arrangements to make their idea come to life.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h3><b></b></h3>
<h3 style=""color: #ff0000;"">You Want Examples?</h3>
<p>Let's say there is an inventor in Allentown, PA and he/she is trying
to connect with retailers to sell their product.  A retailer from Dallas, TX sees this unique
and fascinating product on <b><a href=""www.inventionintention.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">InventionIntention.com</a></b>
and purchases several to sell in his/her store. 
This is not only a big win for the inventor, but also a big win for the retailer
who now has a profitable product that few others have. 
This is also a huge win for the consumer by offering them useful products which had not been previously available.</p>
<p>Here's another:  Perhaps
there is a talented and creative salesperson living in Boca Raton, FL.  They visit <b><a href=""www.inventionintention.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">InventionIntention.com</a></b> and connect with 6 or 7 inventors on the
site to sell their product on a commission basis.  This is not only a great deal for the inventor by
extending his or her sales reach, but also for the salesperson who now has an
income based on his or her efforts.</p>
<p>The possibilities are endless as to whom the inventor can sell
their product or to whom they can create a business partnership.  Individual consumers may also
purchase products through the platform providing a richer sales history and much needed exposure for the inventor while at the same time  giving the consumer a desired product.</p>

<p><b>FAQ</b></p>
<p><b>Why do I need <a href=""www.inventionintention.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">InventionIntention.com</a>?  Why can't I just go to Wal-mart or Target and
show them my great invention?  Surely
they will buy it, right?</b></p>
<p>The truth is, without a proven sales history or very strong track
record, ""Big Box"" retailers usually won't give you the time of
day.  <b><a href=""www.inventionintention.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">InventionIntention.com</a></b> allows you to market your product and create
the sales history you need to negotiate with retailers and investors.</p>
<p><b>Does <a href=""www.inventionintention.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">InventionIntention.com</a>
buy inventions or invest in inventions?</b></p>
<p>No.  We do not invest in, or
develop inventions.  We provide the
platform so the inventor can market and sell their product.  The inventor keeps total control over their
product.  The inventor can use this
platform in place of a private website for marketing and selling purposes to
lift the burden and costs of developing and maintaining a separate website.</p>
<p><b>Can non-subscribers use
<a href=""www.inventionintention.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">InventionIntention.com</a>?</b></p>
<p>Yes!  Anyone can take
advantage of the features and functions of the platform.  In fact, users (including retailers and
wholesalers) can contact the inventor or entrepreneur via the contact feature or
they can purchase products directly through the site.</p>
<p><b>Will there be an annual fee
for members?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><a href=""www.inventionintention.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">InventionIntention.com</a></b> is a membership-based platform. 
Currently there are no membership fees. 
However, in the future we believe it will be necessary to charge a small
annual fee to subscribers (never to consumers) to prevent unwanted, silly,
non-related, non-serious posts.  We believe this will make the website more valuable to the user.  There will never be a fee to browse, purchase
or contact subscribers.</p>
<p><b>Can I contact an inventor and sell for them on
commission?  Will I be charged a fee?</b></p>
<p><b><a href=""www.inventionintention.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">InventionIntention.com</a></b> takes <b><i>no fee or commission</i></b> off of any sale or business
agreement.  You can definitely contact an
inventor and negotiate a sales position. 
Many inventors would be very willing to talk to you to help expand their
product reach.  </p>
<p><b>Can I purchase products for
myself or do I need to be a retailer or wholesaler?</b></p>
<p>The majority (if not all) inventors on the platform would be more
than happy to sell their product to the average individual consumer as well as to
any retailer or wholesaler.</p>
<p><b>Is <a href=""www.inventionintention.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">InventionIntention.com</a>

<p><b>YES!</b>  There are many

with outlandish fees or take a large portion of the equity in your company or
product.  <b><a href=""www.inventionintention.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">InventionIntention.com</a></b> provides the platform and the resources for

</div></div>","This is Crazy!          Let’s Level The Playing Field!
Inventors
and Entrepreneurs are stuck!  There are millions of great ideas but very
few resources to make an idea a reality.  InventionIntention.com is
a marketing, sales, networking and launching platform for the creative
thinker.  We bring inventors and entrepreneurs together for retail
connections, business partnerships, product sales, investors, and business
resources -  all to advance their ideas. 

We
do NOT invest in or take equity of any idea, product or company! 
Your ideas belong to you!
So
many ideas are lost to history because an inventor or entrepreneur doesn't have
the contacts, the capital or the resources to get their idea to the
public.  


Inventors
and Entrepreneurs need YOUR help in bringing new and useful products to the
world market.  We have built a digital platform to bring retailers,
wholesalers and consumers to InventionIntention.com to help move
creative and useful new products into the hands of consumers.
InventionIntention.com is a
fully functional website business ready to expand the dream for the creative
individual.  We are looking to help YOU succeed and secure YOUR future.
We do invest in or take equity interest in any idea, product, or company.  We do not take any commission from any sale or partnership created. Our mission is to bring new products and
ideas to market in a fair, honest way.  Our platform is for YOUR use to
self-market your invented product, find the right businesses to move your idea
forward, or find an investor or business partner.  The more new inventions
are sold or new businesses are opened, the better it is for the world's
consumers.





So, Where Does an Inventor or Entrepreneur           Go for Help?
Where does an inventor go if he or she has questions on development or
distribution?  Where do they go to become inspired or re-inspired?  How do they
find a reputable manufacturer or learn how to make a professional prototype?
General
information can be found on the internet.  However, tangible and practical
information is still too hard to come by.  We want to be the one-stop
destination for those who want to launch their idea as well as for those who
want to do business with inventors and entrepreneurs.
We
are in control of our own destiny!  




A Few Facts
More than half a million patents are filed each year with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and over
300,000 patents are actually granted. 
Over time, that adds up to millions upon millions of patented
inventions.  So, where are these
inventions anyway?  Some of these
inventions and patents are owned by big corporations and a few others you will
see on store shelves.  Where are the rest
of the millions of great ideas?  These
inventions are owned by individual inventors and small companies who are trying
very hard to market their product(s) and sell them locally, nationally or
globally.  Many of these great ideas are
sitting in attics,  basements, and garages
collecting dust because the inventor has run out of resources.  
Keep in mind that inventions are created and patented around the world.  The United States is
just a small portion of the real number of inventors and inventions.
A few sample patent years of the United States are shown below:
  http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/taf/us_stat.htm




What If?
So, what if a person has the idea, dream, and drive but no resources or
contacts to make it happen?  Wouldn't it
be great to have a way to showcase those inventions, sell them, connect with
other inventors, partner with professional resources, and find salespeople to
make your dream come true without being taken advantage of by big money
corporations?
You've seen those commercials on TV promising that they will take
your great idea and turn it into millions of dollars.  The truth is only a very tiny fraction of inventions actually become successful enough through
a third party company to make the inventor any money at all.  Have you ever met anyone who has actually been

Of course not.  It rarely happens

What's worse is that if these companies actually do
accept your idea and develop it, they in return will take a large equity
ownership of the product or company. 
This leaves the inventor and/or entrepreneur with little or no control over
his/her company or idea and the majority of revenue produced by the product
going to the investing company - not the inventor.
What if inventors of the past did not have the resources, business
savvy, networking opportunities or marketing skills to get their products into

without rubber, transistors, plastics, sewing machines, internet, etc.  The list goes on and on.  There are so many inventions that are solving
many of the world's problems and they are in jeopardy of a premature death...unless we can mix things up a bit.

<p>  We, the DOGRISK research group, are a group of researchers in Finland, Europe that have dedicated our research to solving the riddles of diseases that we suspect are due to non-optimal nutrition. We mean diseases like cancer, heart disease, osteoarthritis, epilepsy, diabetes, chronic gastrointestinal diseases, hypothyroidism, teeth and gum problems, and many more. We call ourselves the <i><strong>DOGRISK</strong></i> research group as we are looking for <i><strong>DOG</strong></i>s’ <strong><i>RISK</i></strong> factors for diseases.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Although we do appreciate that other things, such as genes, obesity and environment also have a big impact, our primary focus is on what the dogs eat and how the diet associates with disease. We look at:</p>

<li style=""text-align: left;"">gut microbiota (=the bacteria in the gut),</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">nutrigenomics (=how nutrients and food effect to gene expression) and</li>

<strong>1) A population based epidemiology study:</strong> Over 11.000 dog owners have now answered our extensive, validated questionnaire. We ask about their dog’s characteristics, environment, their human and furry family, their activity, the diseases they have had or have, and their diet. Owner owned dogs have usually happily eaten the same diet for months, or even years. Different dogs have been fed different diets: low quality kibble, high quality kibble, “sausages”, canned foods, home-cooked diets, raw diets, BARF, mixed diets etc. Because of this we can now see what diets have led to less disease and what diets have led to more disease. We just need some salary money so that we can analyze the 11.000 cases. YOU can help us getting this done.</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">
<strong>2) Diet intervention studies: </strong>We have already made the first diet intervention study where about 45 dogs ate one of two balanced diets for 4-5 months. They were otherwise living normal lives with their owner families. We took feces, urine, blood samples, biopsies and hair from the dogs before and after the trial. Then we analyzed the samples for serum values, vitamins, fatty acids, organ function biomarkers, blood cell values, gut microbiota, RNA expression and some other things but now we have no money to do the statistics, write the articles and publish the results. AND we would need to do at least one more similar study to confirm the results! YOU can help us doing this as well!</li>

<strong>Anna Hielm-Bjorkman, DVM, PhD, CVA, Adj.Professor, PI, DOGRISK group leader:</strong>     I am 54 years old and have been working in my own clinic and at the University of Helsinki for  nearly 30 years. I treat all the diseases above and have been getting frustrated over the fact that we doctors (animal and human doctors, in fact) really have no clue why our patients get these diseases. The same is true for our family members and friends; why do we humans get cancer, diabetes, epilepsy etc...? In the work we do here we can get answers for risk factors for both dogs and humans. Modern medicine seldom treats the disease anyway, mostly we just hide symptoms. In my work I use  supplements, surgery, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments and would like to use nutrition much more that we do today. My work in nowadays 80% research but with a zero internal budget. This means I have to get research funding for the whole group from outside the University. And studying dog food is not a top priority in any country's financial plan! Therefore we hope that we who are dog owners could maybe fix this together - as no one else will - and we think we need this information.</li>

In Dogrisk, I use statistical and biochemical analysis of metabolomic data in order to study how dietary intake can cause disease risks in dogs. The metabolome of an organism is primarily influenced by diet, and hence so is their overall health This is a novel field which has important implications towards our understanding of what can cause disease, as well as how diet can be used as a preventative for various disorders.</li>

<p align=""center""><strong>All in all </strong>- The strength of the group is being curious, looking outside the box, love for research, not having any predetermined ideas of what we will find, not going where the fence is lowest, not being pushed around by big companies or big pharma, and having a group of top researchers on the job!<strong> In the DOGRISK project we have no other agenda than learning why and how diseases happen, how this is linked to nutrition - and therefore if and how we can prevent disease, and, if possible, cure it.</strong> But like so many, we are suddenly without funding.</p>
<p align=""center"">Further down we will open up the total impact of our work</p>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<h2><u><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></u></h2>
<p><strong>This project is awesome! </strong>We have already sneaked at the data and <i><strong>KNOW that we will find associations between diet and diseases.</strong></i> Some foods are really protecting while other foods are not so healthy. We do have a lot of hypotheses on why, but to be honest, at this time we still have no clue of what the ""why"" is. Here are some of the hypotheses we work with: Is it that high temperatures during processing make food more unhealthy? Would a high fat, low carb diet be healthier for dogs? Do dogs need vitamin C to be added into the diet? Are kibbles un-physiological as they are so dry? Does the food lack trace-elements that we have not considered? Has the food become too sterile for the good of the patient? Does wrong food mean wrong gut microbiota - and wrong gene-expression? -In the end we will know and will not have to speculate anymore. And <i><strong>we are not at all against any type of diets (dry, canned, raw, home-made) but hope that all results we get will benefit ALL types of diets.</strong></i> If they are too sterile then we might have to put more probiotic bacteria into all type of foods, if dry food is too dry then the industry would write that it has to be mixed with water, if raw food makes dogs get diarrhea then raw food companies would have to write that it takes 3 weeks for the intestines to switch to raw diet etc.</p>
<p>Another great impact of this research is what it has on human nutrition research. It is hard to look at how nutrition and diets associate with human disease as human disease often comes late in life and the diet has been so varied during the persons life. People also cheat, and will not put all the wine and chocolate into the diet diaries. Dog owners seldom cheat and the dogs diet is often the same for months, even years and therefore good to use in calculating risks. As dogs also live in the same environment and has the same diseases as humans they are excellent ""models"" for human disease. Much better that lab rats or mice and much more ethical as we can use happy owner-owned dogs. So this research has a direct impact also on your own and your family's life!</p>
<p><strong>Your contribution will make all the difference.</strong> Please try to spread this message to all breeder, kennel, pet store, groomer and vet internet sites that  you know of! We in the research group are also vets, nutritionists and breeders ourselves and we want to know - so why would not your friends want to know? On top of that, we are also routinized researchers with a good track record of publishing in the best journals in the veterinary or nutritional field (see the researcher pages at <a href=""http://www.dogrisk.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.dogrisk.com/publications</a>). We are also proud of how this research will be conducted: dog owners, pet lovers, people interested in the same diseases in themselves or in friends and relatives, hopefully also the dog food industry, maybe even the medical industry, will go in here together and fund impartial and independent, ethical dog food research. Thank You for helping us doing it this way!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><u><strong>ARE THERE RISKS?</strong></u></h2>
<p>Why do we want to do this crowdfunding? Because we have just spent 2 years trying to get funded and we are tired of getting a ""YES! Super project! But a bit too NEW for us"", ""Interesting...but we cannot help you"" or ""Next year maybe..."". We have therefore put a 500.000 $ goal, as we would like to work now at least for a couple of years, before we would need to gather money again. To work with what we are good at; research!</p>
<p><strong>So what are the risks? </strong>There is no risk. We work for the University of Helsinki; number 67 on the QS sacle and number 103 on the THE scale (these are scales that put universities on lists of being number x in the world) so we work in a good research environment. Research money is scarce in Finland now due to a financial recession, and it is hard to get money for ambitious, innovative, new projects that need a lot of funding due to costly analyses: metabolomics, RNA-sequencing, DNA GWAS, gut microbiota analyses etc. We will do as much analyses as we get money for - most of the analyses for our first diet intervention are already done so we know they work for dog samples. All money we get in will go to finance the work in our research group. That is also why the perks are expensive, although what you get is cheap for us to make. And we will keep you updated on what we do and where we publish through our own net pages at <a href=""http://www.dogrisk.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.dogrisk.com/publications</a></p>
<p><strong>What are the risks if we do not get funded? </strong>That we will misuse our brains and start a nice cafeteria instead...! No...even if we get only a part of what we hope to get in we will continue this work. It stated in 2009 and will continue on a pace that our finances permits. If we get only a little bit of money only one of us will work and we will do no more analyses and no more diet interventions. If we get lots we can work for 20 more years! We can take in new researchers, do new diet interventions, work on what we have and what we will get in. We have struggeled for 8 years now and will either struggle on, or then, with YOUR help-fly over the hurdles!</p>

Koirat syövät tyytyväisenä samaa ruokaa päivästä ja vuodesta toiseen, mutta ruokavalion koostumus vaihtelee koirien välillä.

Seit 9 Jahren bin ich im Bereich Hochschulforschung, als Dozentin und Tierärztin tätig. Ich behandle alle oben genannten Krankheiten und bin unglaublich frustriert darüber, dass wir Ärzte wirklich keine Ahnung haben, warum unser hündischen Patienten eigentlich erkranken. Und das gleiche gilt für unsere zweibeinigen Familienmitglieder und Freunde: Warum bekommen wir Krebs, Diabetes, Epilepsie usw. ...? In meiner Arbeit war ich schon immer daran interessiert, Krankheiten zu vermeiden, an Stelle sie nur zu behandeln. Die moderne Medizin behandelt die Krankheit sowieso meist nicht, sondern kaschiert nur die Symptome. In meiner Arbeit konzentriere ich mich auf die Ernährung und behandle mit Nahrungsergänzungsmitteln, aber auch Chirurgie, pharmakologischen und nicht-pharmakologische Behandlungen, um zu einer echten Gesundung zu gelangen. Meine Arbeit konzentriert sich zu 80% auf die Forschung, allerdings wird mir von der Universität gar kein Budget zur Verfügung gestellt.  Dies bedeutet, dass ich meine Finanzierung selbst bewerkstelligen muss.

Wir haben die Daten bereits in Augenschein genommen und die verraten uns bereits, dass es einen Zusammenhang zwischen Erkrankungen und der Ernährung gibt. Einige Lebensmittel wirken sich tatsächlich positiv aus, während andere wirklich ungesund sind ... Wir haben eine Theorie, warum das der Fall sein könnte, aber um ehrlich zu sein, wissen wir es eben noch nicht genau. Um mal einige Beispiele zu nennen: Führt das Erhitzen von Lebensmitteln dazu, dass sie ungesünder werden? Ist eine fettreiche, aber kohlenhydratarme Ernährung gesünder für Hunde? Benötigen Hunde wirklich kein Vitamin C im Futter? Ist Trockenfutter einfach „zu trocken“? Fehlen im Fertigfutter Nährstoffe, die wir vielleicht gar nicht auf dem Schirm hatten? Ist das Futter für eine gesunde Ernährung vielleicht einfach zu „steril“? Wenn wir das erforschen können, werden wir es wissen und müssen nicht mehr spekulieren.</p><p> </p><p>Eine weitere große Auswirkung unserer Forschung bezieht sich es auf die menschliche Ernährung. In Bezug auf uns Menschen ist es noch schwerer, Zusammenhänge zwischen Ernährung und Erkrankungen festzustellen, da wir meist erst im Alter erkranken und die Ernährung sich im Laufe eines Menschenlebens ständig verändert. Menschen neigen außerdem dazu, Fragebögen nicht ganz so ehrlich auszufüllen und die abendlichen Chips, Schokolade oder das Glas Wein nicht mit in den Fragebogen einzutragen. Das ist bei Hunden anders, da dort der Mensch das Futter zuteilt. Außerdem bleibt die Ernährung der Tiere über Monate oder gar Jahre gleich. Weil Menschen und Hunde aber ansonsten in der gleichen Umgebung leben und oftmals unter den gleichen Erkrankungen leiden, können wir Rückschlüsse auf die menschliche Ernährung ziehen.

LETS FIND OUT WHAT A DOG WOULD COOK AND EAT, IF IT COULD CHOOSE!
 

VALENTINES DAY IS COMING UP - THERE IS STILL A REASON TO GIVE YOUR DOG A PRESENT. GIVE HIM AND US EVIDENCE-BASED KNOWLEDGE - DO IT TODAY!

Help us do research on associations between dog diets and disease. A touchy subject - but Oh! - so important!
  We, the DOGRISK research group, are a group of researchers in Finland, Europe that have dedicated our research to solving the riddles of diseases that we suspect are due to non-optimal nutrition. We mean diseases like cancer, heart disease, osteoarthritis, epilepsy, diabetes, chronic gastrointestinal diseases, hypothyroidism, teeth and gum problems, and many more. We call ourselves the DOGRISK research group as we are looking for DOGs’ RISK factors for diseases.
Although we do appreciate that other things, such as genes, obesity and environment also have a big impact, our primary focus is on what the dogs eat and how the diet associates with disease. We look at:

macro and micro nutrients in the foods and in the dog,
gut microbiota (=the bacteria in the gut),
nutrigenomics (=how nutrients and food effect to gene expression) and
epidemiology (=where we look at data on what dogs eat and what diseases they have and see if there is an association).

Our ongoing projects:


1) A population based epidemiology study: Over 11.000 dog owners have now answered our extensive, validated questionnaire. We ask about their dog’s characteristics, environment, their human and furry family, their activity, the diseases they have had or have, and their diet. Owner owned dogs have usually happily eaten the same diet for months, or even years. Different dogs have been fed different diets: low quality kibble, high quality kibble, “sausages”, canned foods, home-cooked diets, raw diets, BARF, mixed diets etc. Because of this we can now see what diets have led to less disease and what diets have led to more disease. We just need some salary money so that we can analyze the 11.000 cases. YOU can help us getting this done.

2) Diet intervention studies: We have already made the first diet intervention study where about 45 dogs ate one of two balanced diets for 4-5 months. They were otherwise living normal lives with their owner families. We took feces, urine, blood samples, biopsies and hair from the dogs before and after the trial. Then we analyzed the samples for serum values, vitamins, fatty acids, organ function biomarkers, blood cell values, gut microbiota, RNA expression and some other things but now we have no money to do the statistics, write the articles and publish the results. AND we would need to do at least one more similar study to confirm the results! YOU can help us doing this as well!

 
WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET:
We need research funding and you will get evidence-based information and published data on how different diets associate with dog diseases.
We would need 25 $ from EVERYBODY that gets this message. For that you can e.g. get this awesome ribbon  to tell others that you care: 

Or a VERY SMALL SUM from everyone on earth that owns, or has ever owned, a dog or that has had a 2-or 4 legged family member with any of the diseases above. Here is what we need and what we can do with the money:



For every 1.000 $: we can analyze one dog, at one time point (all analyses). So for a trial of 50 dogs with 3 times sampling, we need 150.000 $. Expensive - but sooooo interesting!


For every 2.000 $: we can publish one article in a peer-reviewed, open access journal. In two years we anticipate to publish 15 so we would need 30.000 $

For 10.000 $: we can send our researchers to international veterinary and dog nutrition conferences to present independent diet-related research results
For 10.000 $: we can use statisticians and bioinformatics for our papers

For every 150.000 $: we can pay salary for one year for  our researchers and we hope to get enough money to work undisturbed for 2 years, meaning 300.000 $.

THIS MAKES A TOTAL OF  2 YEARS OF WORK FOR 500.000 $ - Research is expensive!

BUT - if we do this together we researchers can continue the work. This is something to give your dog friend this year as a Valentines gift. We suggest you give your dog a hug and a kiss and let it know that this years present went to trying to figure out diseases. If you send us a picture of your dog as a message to our Facebook page ""dogrisk"", we will also insert a text into the picture, saying something like ""My owner supports DOGRISK research!"" This you can then use when you let your friends know about the campaign on social media (as you spread the message, this will also help us). It will look something like this:

 
As we get to continue we will publish peer-reviewed journal articles on associations between diet and atopy, osteoarthritis, epilepsy, cancer, tartar and many other diseases. As we go we will all learn at least some more things about what we SHOULD  or SHOULD NOT feed our friends. The good thing is that we are already more than half way as we already have the data from our questionnaire and from our first feeding trial, BUT WE JUST DO NOT HAVE ANY FUNDS RIGHT NOW TO ANALYZE them. To be able to do it, we need funding and therefore we have some perks that will leave lots of money for research. So please also consider our expensive - but unique- perks!
YOUR SUPPORT WILL HELP US CONTINUE OUR IMPORTANT RESEARCH!
 
THE GROUP
If You still want to read on we will now introduce ourselves briefly:


Anna Hielm-Bjorkman, DVM, PhD, CVA, Adj.Professor, PI, DOGRISK group leader:     I am 54 years old and have been working in my own clinic and at the University of Helsinki for  nearly 30 years. I treat all the diseases above and have been getting frustrated over the fact that we doctors (animal and human doctors, in fact) really have no clue why our patients get these diseases. The same is true for our family members and friends; why do we humans get cancer, diabetes, epilepsy etc...? In the work we do here we can get answers for risk factors for both dogs and humans. Modern medicine seldom treats the disease anyway, mostly we just hide symptoms. In my work I use  supplements, surgery, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments and would like to use nutrition much more that we do today. My work in nowadays 80% research but with a zero internal budget. This means I have to get research funding for the whole group from outside the University. And studying dog food is not a top priority in any country's financial plan! Therefore we hope that we who are dog owners could maybe fix this together - as no one else will - and we think we need this information.

Liisa Uusitalo, MSci, PhD (Human/dog nutrition epidemiology): I am a nutritional scientist with a doctor's degree in epidemiology. I have been involved in human nutrition epidemiology studying  the associations of diet with type 1 diabetes. I have been working in the DOGRISK project for a year and a half, and I am really excited about using my epidemiologic insight for the benefit on animals, as well as of humans, now. There are so many inspiring analysis waiting: epilepsy, cancer, diabetes, atopy, joint diseases...all important for both dogs and humans!

Johanna Anturaniemi, MSci (animal breeding), PhD student (nutrigenomics, metabolomics): I am an agronomist and graduated in 2010 having animal breeding (genetics!) as my major. Since then I have worked in the DOGRISK research group. I am really interested in nutrition and its impact on health and diseases. I would like to know much more about the complex network of genes, nutrients, and metabolism. To study these associations in dogs will help us understand their role in our dogs' and also our own life. My inspiration for this work has been my atopic Staffy 'Elvis' who passed away in 2014.

Noora Sjögren, DVM, MSci (Animal nutrition), PhD student, Animal nutrition diplomate student: I am a 36 years old veterinarian, I have a MSc in animal nutrition and I am an agronomist. In spring 2016 I was accepted as a  ECVCN (The European College of Veterinary and Comparative Nutrition) resident, and my goal is to be a diplomate in the area of clinical animal nutrition.  Animal nutrition has always been my interest and specially the opportunities it brings in to treating both diseases and preventing them. In my everyday practice as a vet I want to treat my patients as good as possible, and rather prevent the diseases than treat them. I want to find the diseases that can be prevented by nutrition. Website: https://fi.linkedin.com/in/noora-sj%C3%B6gren-8...

Robin Moore, Masters student (biochemistry, organic chemistry)  I am 23 years old, and began studies at the University of Helsinki in Fall 2012, majoring in chemistry and minoring in molecular biology. In Dogrisk, I use statistical and biochemical analysis of metabolomic data in order to study how dietary intake can cause disease risks in dogs. The metabolome of an organism is primarily influenced by diet, and hence so is their overall health This is a novel field which has important implications towards our understanding of what can cause disease, as well as how diet can be used as a preventative for various disorders.

Susanna Paavilainen, Anna Loimaranta and Niina Siljander and their dogs are in the DOGRISK cancer sniffing dogs project. We will campaign for that project later.
We also have Sara Zaldivar-Lopez from Spain, Stella Barrouin-Melo from Brazil, Ziga Gerber from Slovenia and others that ave been working on the project when visiting Finland. Also, many not here mentioned PhD students and licenciate vet students have worked on the project.

All in all - The strength of the group is being curious, looking outside the box, love for research, not having any predetermined ideas of what we will find, not going where the fence is lowest, not being pushed around by big companies or big pharma, and having a group of top researchers on the job! In the DOGRISK project we have no other agenda than learning why and how diseases happen, how this is linked to nutrition - and therefore if and how we can prevent disease, and, if possible, cure it. But like so many, we are suddenly without funding.
Further down we will open up the total impact of our work
 
THE IMPACT
This project is awesome! We have already sneaked at the data and KNOW that we will find associations between diet and diseases. Some foods are really protecting while other foods are not so healthy. We do have a lot of hypotheses on why, but to be honest, at this time we still have no clue of what the ""why"" is. Here are some of the hypotheses we work with: Is it that high temperatures during processing make food more unhealthy? Would a high fat, low carb diet be healthier for dogs? Do dogs need vitamin C to be added into the diet? Are kibbles un-physiological as they are so dry? Does the food lack trace-elements that we have not considered? Has the food become too sterile for the good of the patient? Does wrong food mean wrong gut microbiota - and wrong gene-expression? -In the end we will know and will not have to speculate anymore. And we are not at all against any type of diets (dry, canned, raw, home-made) but hope that all results we get will benefit ALL types of diets. If they are too sterile then we might have to put more probiotic bacteria into all type of foods, if dry food is too dry then the industry would write that it has to be mixed with water, if raw food makes dogs get diarrhea then raw food companies would have to write that it takes 3 weeks for the intestines to switch to raw diet etc.
Another great impact of this research is what it has on human nutrition research. It is hard to look at how nutrition and diets associate with human disease as human disease often comes late in life and the diet has been so varied during the persons life. People also cheat, and will not put all the wine and chocolate into the diet diaries. Dog owners seldom cheat and the dogs diet is often the same for months, even years and therefore good to use in calculating risks. As dogs also live in the same environment and has the same diseases as humans they are excellent ""models"" for human disease. Much better that lab rats or mice and much more ethical as we can use happy owner-owned dogs. So this research has a direct impact also on your own and your family's life!
Your contribution will make all the difference. Please try to spread this message to all breeder, kennel, pet store, groomer and vet internet sites that  you know of! We in the research group are also vets, nutritionists and breeders ourselves and we want to know - so why would not your friends want to know? On top of that, we are also routinized researchers with a good track record of publishing in the best journals in the veterinary or nutritional field (see the researcher pages at http://www.dogrisk.com/publications). We are also proud of how this research will be conducted: dog owners, pet lovers, people interested in the same diseases in themselves or in friends and relatives, hopefully also the dog food industry, maybe even the medical industry, will go in here together and fund impartial and independent, ethical dog food research. Thank You for helping us doing it this way!
 
ARE THERE RISKS?
Why do we want to do this crowdfunding? Because we have just spent 2 years trying to get funded and we are tired of getting a ""YES! Super project! But a bit too NEW for us"", ""Interesting...but we cannot help you"" or ""Next year maybe..."". We have therefore put a 500.000 $ goal, as we would like to work now at least for a couple of years, before we would need to gather money again. To work with what we are good at; research!
So what are the risks? There is no risk. We work for the University of Helsinki; number 67 on the QS sacle and number 103 on the THE scale (these are scales that put universities on lists of being number x in the world) so we work in a good research environment. Research money is scarce in Finland now due to a financial recession, and it is hard to get money for ambitious, innovative, new projects that need a lot of funding due to costly analyses: metabolomics, RNA-sequencing, DNA GWAS, gut microbiota analyses etc. We will do as much analyses as we get money for - most of the analyses for our first diet intervention are already done so we know they work for dog samples. All money we get in will go to finance the work in our research group. That is also why the perks are expensive, although what you get is cheap for us to make. And we will keep you updated on what we do and where we publish through our own net pages at http://www.dogrisk.com/publications
What are the risks if we do not get funded? That we will misuse our brains and start a nice cafeteria instead...! No...even if we get only a part of what we hope to get in we will continue this work. It stated in 2009 and will continue on a pace that our finances permits. If we get only a little bit of money only one of us will work and we will do no more analyses and no more diet interventions. If we get lots we can work for 20 more years! We can take in new researchers, do new diet interventions, work on what we have and what we will get in. We have struggeled for 8 years now and will either struggle on, or then, with YOUR help-fly over the hurdles!

Tieteellistä tutkimustietoa ruokavalioiden paremmuudesta ei tällä hetkellä juurikaan ole. Helsingin yliopistossa on käynnissä tutkimusprojekti koirien ruokinnan ja terveyden yhteyksistä. Rahoita projektiamme ja auta meitä saamaan työmme valmiiksi!DOGRISK on suomalainen tutkimusryhmä, joka selvittää koirien ruokinnan yhteyttä niiden sairausriskeihin. Tutkimme esimerkiksi syöpää, sydänsairauksia, nivelrikkoa, epilepsiaa, diabetesta, ruoansulatuskanavan sairauksia, kilpirauhasen vajaatoimintaa ja hammassairauksia. Sairausriskeihin vaikuttavat ruokinnan lisäksi muut ympäristötekijät ja geneettinen perimä, mutta meidän pääasiallinen tutkimuskohteemme on juuri ruokinta, jota tutkimme monipuolisesti eri tieteenalojen menetelmiä ja kysymyksenasetteluja hyödyntäen. Projektissa käytetään kahta erilaista tutkimusasetelmaa: 1) havainnoivaa epidemiologista kyselytutkimusta ja 2) ruokintainterventiokokeita.1) Olemme keränneet laajalla kyselylomakkeella tietoa jo lähes 11 000 koiranomistajalta. Kysely käsittelee koiran ominaisuuksia, käyttöä, elinympäristöä, ruokintaa ja sairauksia. Koirat syövät tyytyväisenä samaa ruokaa päivästä ja vuodesta toiseen, mutta ruokavalion koostumus vaihtelee koirien välillä. Jotkut syövät kuivamuonaa, jotkut koiranmakkaraa ja tölkkiruokaa, jotkut taas kotiruokaa tai raakaruokaa. Tässä suhteessa koirilla on helppo jäljittää ruokinnan ja sairauksien välisiä yhteyksiä. Tarvitaan vain rahoitusta, jotta aineisto saadaan nyt analysoitua. Tähän tarvitsemme apuasi!2) Olemme jo toteuttaneet ensimmäisen ruokintainterventiotutkimuksemme, jossa 45 koiraa noudatti kahta erilaista, tasapainoista ruokavaliota 4-5-kuukauden ajan. Koirat jatkoivat tavallista elämäänsä omistajaperheissään tutkimuksen ajan. Tutkimuksen alussa ja lopussa niiltä kerättiin uloste-, virtsa-, veri-, karva- ja kudosnäytteet. Näytteistä on tehty jo monenlaisia mittauksia (mm. vitamiineja, rasvahappoja, verisoluja, suolistomikrobeja ja RNA-geeniekspressiota), mutta mittaustulosten analysoimiseen ja julkaisemiseen meillä ei tällä hetkellä ole rahoitusta. Tutkimus pitäisi myös toistaa tulosten varmistamiseksi. Tässäkin voit auttaa rahoittamalla projektiamme!Katso miten voit auttaa oikeanpuoleisista ”Perkseistä” (=vastineet).

Hilf uns dabei, unabhängig von der Futtermittelindustrie zu forschen und diese wichtige Frage endlich zu beantworten. Futtertrends kommen und gehen, stets begleitet von hitzigen Diskussionen darüber, welche Ernährungsform die gesündeste ist: Die Hundehalter schlagen sich deswegen förmlich die Köpfe ein. Bis heute gibt es dazu keine ernstzunehmenden, wissenschaftlichen und vor allem unabhängigen Fakten. Deswegen haben wir beschlossen, etwas dagegen zu unternehmen. Wir, die DOGRISK Forschungsgruppe, wollen es genau wissen! Allerdings ist professionelle Forschung teuer und die Suche nach Sponsoren ist schwierig, wenn es um alternative Fütterungsmethoden geht und keine multinationalen Konzerne hinter der Forschungsidee stehen. Deswegen brauchen wir die Unterstützung der Hundehalter, deswegen brauchen wir Deine Unterstützung! Hilf uns dabei, unabhängige Forschung zu betreiben. Unterstütze unsere Forschung: Im Sinne gesunder Hunde Beteilige Dich jetzt! Jeder Euro zählt!Hilf uns, die Zusammenhänge zwischen Fütterung und Erkrankungen zu belegen! Wie Du helfen kannst Du kannst uns dabei helfen, unabhängig zu forschen – selbst, wenn Du kein Geld ausgeben kannst. Perk / Prämie kaufenDu kannst einen finanziellen Beitrag leisten, indem Du eine unserer Prämien kaufst. Du erhältst also eine Gegenleistung für Dein Geld. Angefangen vom DOGRISK Newsletter, über Studien und Bücher bis hin zu einem Tag in unserem Labor, haben wir interessante Prämien zusammengestellt. Die Einnahmen fließen direkt in unsere Projekte.  Kleinen Betrag spendenWenn Dir die Perks zu teuer sind, kannst Du natürlich einfach einen kleineren Betrag spenden. Jeder Euro zählt! Denk daran, es gibt Millionen von Hundehaltern in Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz. Wenn jeder nur 10 Cent spenden würde, könnten wir unabhängig forschen. Aktion teilenAuch wenn Du gar keine finanziellen Mittel beisteuern kannst, kannst Du uns helfen. Teile diese Aktion auf Facebook, bei Twitter oder per E-Mail. Informiere jeden, den Du kennst darüber. Wer wir sindWir, die DOGRISK Research Group, sind eine Gruppe von unabhängigen Wissenschaftlern aus Finnland und widmen unsere Forschung zur Lösung des Rätsels, ob bestimmte Erkrankungen die Folge nicht optimaler Fütterung sein könnten. Gemeint sind Krankheiten wie Krebs, Herzkrankheiten, Arthrose, Epilepsie, Diabetes, chronische Magen-Darm-Erkrankungen, Schilddrüsenunterfunktion, Zahn- und Zahnfleisch-Probleme ... und viele mehr. Wir nennen uns die DOGRISK Research Group, wie wir nach Risikofaktoren für Erkrankungen von Hunden suchen. Uns ist selbstverständlich bewusst, dass andere Einflussfaktoren wie Genetik oder Umwelt ebenfalls eine große Rolle spielen, dennoch liegt unser Hauptaugenmerk auf der Ernährung und darauf, ob Erkrankungen mit der Fütterung in einem Zusammenhang stehen. Wenn Du genaueres über uns wissen willst, scrolle nach unten, wir möchten, dass Du alles über uns und unsere Arbeit erfährst. Woran wir arbeiten  Im Moment konzentriert sich unsere Forschung auf 2 sehr interessante Projekte:
Halterbefragung zur Entstehung von Krankheiten: 11.000 Hundebesitzer haben bisher unsere umfangreichen, validierten Fragebögen beantwortet. Wir befragen die Tierhalter nach Lebensumständen, Aktivität, etwaigen Erkrankungen und natürlich nach der Art der Ernährung. Ob nun Fertigfutter, Tischreste oder BARF – wir können anhand dieser Daten auswerten, welche Fütterungsart mit welchen Erkrankungen in einem kausalen Zusammenhang steht. Wir benötigen nur noch die notwendigen finanziellen Mittel, um diese riesige Datenmenge auszuwerten. Hilf uns dabei!
Studie zum Einfluss einer Ernährungsumstellung: Wir haben 45 Hunde in zwei Gruppen unterteilt. Jede Gruppe bekam über einen Zeitraum von 4 bis 5 Monaten jeweils ein bestimmtes, ausgewogenes Futter. Dabei lebten sie zuhause bei ihren Familien. Wir haben Kot-, Urin- und Blutuntersuchungen vor und nach der Futterumstellung durchgeführt. Leider fehlen uns nun die finanziellen Mittel, um eine statistische Auswertung durchzuführen, Artikel zu schreiben und diese zu veröffentlichen. Außerdem müssen wir natürlich noch eine weitere Studie durchführen, um die Ergebnisse zu bestätigen. Du kannst uns dabei helfen, das umzusetzen!
 Was wir brauchenWir benötigen natürlich Forschungsgelder für diese Projekte… denn Forschung ist teuer: Es kostet allein 1.000 €, eine komplette Analyse für einen einzigen Hund durchzuführen. Nehmen 50 Hunde an einer Studie teil und jeder Fall muss 3-mal ausgewertet werden (vor, während und nach der Futterumstellung), so sind das schon 150.000 €. Es kostet 2.000 €, einen wissenschaftlichen Artikel in einer anerkannten Fachzeitschrift zu veröffentlichen. Und nur dann wird eine Studie in Fachkreisen Beachtung finden. Wir gehen davon aus, in den nächsten beiden Jahren 15 Artikel zu veröffentlichen, das macht 30.000 €. Es kostet 10.000 € statistische Analysen durchführen zu lassen, die für ernstzunehmende Forschung unerlässlich ist.   Es kostet 150.000 € das Jahresgehalt aller beteiligten Wissenschaftler der DOGRISK Research Group zu finanzieren. Das macht 300.000 € für 2 Jahre Forschung. Wir benötigen also 500.000 €, um 2 Jahre lang im Sinne gesunder Hunde forschen zu können. Die Mitglieder der ForschungsgruppeDamit Du ganz genau weißt, wen Du unterstützt, möchten wir uns gern einzeln vorstellen. Anna Hielm-Bjorkman, DVM, PhD, Professor, PI, DOGRISK Group Leiterin: Ich bin 54 Jahre alt und habe 19 Jahre lang als praktizierende Tierärztin gearbeitet. Seit 9 Jahren bin ich im Bereich Hochschulforschung, als Dozentin und Tierärztin tätig. Ich behandle alle oben genannten Krankheiten und bin unglaublich frustriert darüber, dass wir Ärzte wirklich keine Ahnung haben, warum unser hündischen Patienten eigentlich erkranken. Und das gleiche gilt für unsere zweibeinigen Familienmitglieder und Freunde: Warum bekommen wir Krebs, Diabetes, Epilepsie usw. ...? In meiner Arbeit war ich schon immer daran interessiert, Krankheiten zu vermeiden, an Stelle sie nur zu behandeln. Die moderne Medizin behandelt die Krankheit sowieso meist nicht, sondern kaschiert nur die Symptome. In meiner Arbeit konzentriere ich mich auf die Ernährung und behandle mit Nahrungsergänzungsmitteln, aber auch Chirurgie, pharmakologischen und nicht-pharmakologische Behandlungen, um zu einer echten Gesundung zu gelangen. Meine Arbeit konzentriert sich zu 80% auf die Forschung, allerdings wird mir von der Universität gar kein Budget zur Verfügung gestellt.  Dies bedeutet, dass ich meine Finanzierung selbst bewerkstelligen muss. Und Hundefutter scheint nicht die oberste Priorität im Finanzplan von Finnland zu sein…Ich habe natürlich auch einen Vierbeiner zuhause. Sie heißt Lyra, ist ca. 2 Jahre alt und kommt aus Griechenland. Sie wird roh ernährt. Webseite:  https://tuhat.halvi.helsinki.fi/portal/en/person/hielmb    Liisa Uusitalo, MSCI, PhD (Mensch / Hund Ernährungsepidemiologie): Ich bin eine Ernährungswissenschaftlerin und habe im Bereich Epidemiologie promoviert. Ich war seit meinem Studienabschluss im Bereich der menschlichen Ernährungsepidemiologie tätig, wobei ich mich auf die Entstehung von Typ-1-Diabetes konzentriert habe. Seit anderthalb Jahren engagiere ich mich für das DOGRISK Projekt und ich warte gespannt darauf, endlich meine epidemiologischen Erkenntnisse zum Nutzen von Mensch und Tier einzusetzen. Es gibt so viele spannenden Themen zu denen wir noch viel zu wenig wissen: Epilepsie, Krebs, Diabetes, Allergien, Gelenkerkrankungen ... alle samt wichtig für Hunde und Menschen! Webseite: https://www.linkedin.com/in/liisa-uusitalo-b66a74a4?authType=NAME_SEARCH&authToken=Rhie&locale=en_US&srchid=46914541481919461126&srchindex=1&srchtotal=4&trk=vsrp_people_res_name&trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A46914541481919461126%2CVSRPtargetId%3A372904062%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary%2CVSRPnm%3Atrue%2CauthType%3ANAME_SEARCH Johanna Anturaniemi, MSCI (Tierzucht), Doktorandin (Nutrigenomik, Metabolomik): Ich bin Agrarwissenschaftlerin und schloss mein Studium im Jahr 2010 im Bereich Tierzucht mit dem Hauptfach Genetik ab. Seitdem arbeite ich bei der DOGRISK Research Group. Der Einfluss der Ernährung auf die Gesundheit und Erkrankungen ist ein hochinteressantes Forschungsgebiet. Ich möchte unbedingt die komplexen Zusammenhänge zwischen Genetik, Ernährung und Stoffwechsel erforschen. Solche Erkenntnisse würden uns helfen, die Bedeutung für unser Leben und auch das unserer Hunde zu verstehen. Meine Inspiration für diese Arbeit war mein Staffi 'Elvis', der unter Allergien litt und 2014 leider verstorben ist. Webseite: https://tuhat.helsinki.fi/portal/en/persons/johanna-anturaniemi(eea11397-1f2f-4343-a2f5-af5aa71c0993).html Noora Sjögren, DVM, MSCI (Tierernährung), Doktorandin im Bereich Tierernährung: Ich bin eine 36-jährige Tierärztin, ich habe einen Master of Science in Tierernährung. Außerdem bin ich Agrarwissenschaftlerin. Im Frühjahr 2016 wurde ich bei ECVC (The European College of Veterinary and Comparative Nutrition) angenommen und mein Ziel ist es, im Bereich der klinischen Ernährung Tieren zu forschen. Tierernährung hat hat mich schon immer interessiert, vor allem die Behandlung und Prävention von Erkrankungen.  In meiner täglichen Arbeit als Tierärztin möchte ich meine Patienten so gut wie möglich behandeln und Krankheiten lieber verhindern, als sie zu threrapieren. Meine zwei Westies ""Tarmo"" und ""Tyyne“ sowie mein Zwergdackel „Hilkka“ sind meine Inspiration – auch für Sie möchte ich herausfinden, welche Erkrankungen man mit Hilfe einer optimalen Ernährung verhindern kann. Außerdem gehört Robin Moore zu unserem Team, er ist eine 23-jähriger Bachelor Student im Bereich Biochemie.  Webseite: https://tuhat.helsinki.fi/portal/fi/persons/robin-moore(3ce9d107-a531-470b-b5b3-39199985bff5).html Zusätzlich unterstützen uns Susanna Paavilainen, Anna Loimaranta, Niina Siljander,Sara Zaldivar-Lopez, Stella Barrouin-Melo und Ziga Gerber. Die Stärke unserer Forschungsgruppe liegt darin, neugierig zu sein, auf der Suche nach Antworten auch über den Tellerrand zu schauen, Forschung im Sinne der Tiere zu lieben, keine vorgefertigten Meinungen zu haben, auch mal um die Ecke zu denken und vor allem, sich nicht von großen Futtermittelherstellern oder der Pharmaindustrie „herumschupsen“ zu lassen. Außerdem sind wir – bei aller Bescheidenheit – hervorragende Wissenschaftler. Die DOGRISK Forschungsgruppe hat nur ein Ziel: zu lernen, wie Krankheiten entstehen und dies mit der Ernährung in Verbindung gebracht werden kann. Vor allem aber, wie man diese Erkrankungen verhindern und behandeln kann. Im Sinne der Tiere und nicht mit Gewinnen, Margen und Marktanteilen im Hinterkopf.  Positive Auswirkungen unserer ForschungUnser Projekt ist einfach genial! Wir haben die Daten bereits in Augenschein genommen und die verraten uns bereits, dass es einen Zusammenhang zwischen Erkrankungen und der Ernährung gibt. Einige Lebensmittel wirken sich tatsächlich positiv aus, während andere wirklich ungesund sind ... Wir haben eine Theorie, warum das der Fall sein könnte, aber um ehrlich zu sein, wissen wir es eben noch nicht genau. Um mal einige Beispiele zu nennen: Führt das Erhitzen von Lebensmitteln dazu, dass sie ungesünder werden? Ist eine fettreiche, aber kohlenhydratarme Ernährung gesünder für Hunde? Benötigen Hunde wirklich kein Vitamin C im Futter? Ist Trockenfutter einfach „zu trocken“? Fehlen im Fertigfutter Nährstoffe, die wir vielleicht gar nicht auf dem Schirm hatten? Ist das Futter für eine gesunde Ernährung vielleicht einfach zu „steril“? Wenn wir das erforschen können, werden wir es wissen und müssen nicht mehr spekulieren. Eine weitere große Auswirkung unserer Forschung bezieht sich es auf die menschliche Ernährung. In Bezug auf uns Menschen ist es noch schwerer, Zusammenhänge zwischen Ernährung und Erkrankungen festzustellen, da wir meist erst im Alter erkranken und die Ernährung sich im Laufe eines Menschenlebens ständig verändert. Menschen neigen außerdem dazu, Fragebögen nicht ganz so ehrlich auszufüllen und die abendlichen Chips, Schokolade oder das Glas Wein nicht mit in den Fragebogen einzutragen. Das ist bei Hunden anders, da dort der Mensch das Futter zuteilt. Außerdem bleibt die Ernährung der Tiere über Monate oder gar Jahre gleich. Weil Menschen und Hunde aber ansonsten in der gleichen Umgebung leben und oftmals unter den gleichen Erkrankungen leiden, können wir Rückschlüsse auf die menschliche Ernährung ziehen. Das ist bei Laborratten nicht in dem Umfang möglich, da sie eben unter Laborbedingungen gehalten werden. Bitte unterstütze uns! Dein Beitrag kann den Unterschied machen. Teile diese Aktion in Sozialen Medien und informiere andere Hundehalter, Deinen Züchter, Deinen Tierarzt oder Tierheilpraktiker, den Zooladen um die Ecke oder das örtliche Tierheim. Wir sind routinierte Wissenschaftler mit einer beeindruckenden Reihe von Publikationen in den besten Fachzeitschriften für Veterinär- und Ernährungswissenschaften (siehe: http://www.dogrisk.com/publications). Wir sind stolz auf unsere Forschung und hoffen, einen Beitrag zur Gesunderhaltung unserer Hunde leisten zu können. Wir forschen für alle Hundebesitzer, Tierliebhaber und Menschen, die vielleicht unter den gleichen Erkrankungen leiden wie ihre geliebten Vierbeiner. Wir hoffen, mit unserer Forschung einen Einfluss auf die Futtermittel- und Pharmaindustrie zu nehmen. Aber das geht nur, wenn wir unabhängig forschen können und dafür brauchen wir Deine Hilfe!Vielen Dank für Deine Unterstützung! -------------------------       And here is part of the text in Portuguese: O que os cães cozinhariam; carne, gorduras, ossos, ração seca, alimentos crus,…?Todos nós perguntamos que tipo de alimento devemos dar aos nossos animais de estimação.

As our Conny are so different from any other food in the fast food and finger food industry we believe Conny will be a fresh start in an industry that has only sold burgers, fries and fried chicken for decades!
The young population of Latvia has an open mind, and is looking to see their country develop! Here we are to bring jobs, and fresh opportunities to this fabulous country!
Conny are simply delicious!
Team pictures                                    
Kristina, Stefano and Jess

                                                                                      Biography&storyStefano is born in Italy, Jess (me) is also born in Italy and Kristina was born in Latvia! We are a great and cooperative team full of ideas and ready to bring change to the fast food Industry with our delicious Conny's!! We have had a huge love for food from the beginning of our days! we always loved to cook, eat and try new foods!
The most passionate about cooking is Stefano, the oldest guy in our profile picture, don't tell him I wrote that :))
Anyways, he was the one that came up with the Conny idea, and he wanted to create a team to bring Conny to life!
Therefore he asked me, (Jess the guy with the brown hair, on the right of the picture) and his wife Kristina (the blond woman sitting on the chair) to help him bring this new food to life, so everybody could taste one! 
We all agreed to make a team, and bring this idea to life, because we believed in it from the first second we put that Conny into our mouths, they completely melted away!! It was so delicious!
Here we are now working hard to bring Conny to Latvia for you, your family and your friends!

We have nearly everything that we need to get started


We have a Latvian registered company called SIA CONNY
We have all the food menu ready, with all the different delicious Conny recipes!






we have all the costs figured out about the price to make one single Conny, how much do we have to sell to cover our costs!
We would potentially like to open our selling point in Riga City Center, but in case it is not possible we are flexible to other solutions(opening in a shopping center)!

why we need your funding


We need 46'599$ or 43'000€ (we put the funding in dollars to abilitate people to fund us via credit/debit card, which wasn't an option if we asked our funding in euros.) 
We need your funding to find and rent a place where we will open our first restaurant in Latvia!

If we don't get fully funded no stress:


If we need from 1€-10'000€ to reach our final goal we will take a loan from the bank.
In case the sum needed to reach our goal is higher than 10'000€ we will get a bank loan, and we will find other investors!

Risks & Challenges


Any business has risks and difficulties that they have to overcome


Our major risk is to cover the costs, we plan to cover them by having a strong and influent advertising campaign to let as many people in Latvia know about Conny arriving in Latvia.
People not liking our Conny, we plan to overcome this potential problem by being very open to suggestions that the customers might have about Conny, or anything else they might feel needs some improvement.
Are we able to run a business? Yes we have members of our team with 20 years experience in business, and we have figured out every cost that our business we have, from the food, to the electricity and every other cost.

 This are our potential difficulties we feel ready to overcome

<span><div align=""justify"">Α few monhs ago, we decided to share our venture with the Indiegogo community, hoping to find <b>support</b> for our new beggining. You see, economy in Greece is exactly what it  looks like.  Building a company from scratch is a big, scary adventure, involving lots of difficulties and expenses. The annual taxation rate for a small business is 26% of the total profit, while you are also obliged to pay in advance a 50 % tax rate of the next year -not to mention the endless bureaucracy and the unfriendly financial environment. <br/>Despite all these facts, though, we remain optimistic and feel certain that our idea will offer <b>a great value</b> to anyone who wishes to discover the <b>authentic local life in Athens</b>. <br/>This is why we need your support; if we cover our first year expenses with the help of your contribution, we will be able to pay all the taxes, fees &amp; payments that are necessary in order to fully operate our business. <b>We begin now, we begin from scratch &amp; we trust that your help combined with our work will bring to life an exciting new venture in the tourism market of Greece.</b><br/><br/>By supporting us:<br/><ul>
<li>You support Greek economy by giving jobs to Greek people. Unemployment is the #1 problem of our country.</li>
<li>You help us inspire young Greeks to make their efforts in their own country, instead of leaving Greece. Crowdfunding is a really great way to kick-off your own venture, so let's inspire more people to use it.</li>
<li>You help us create an outgoing sustainable business model that will create even more jobs in the future. Our vision is to expand Greeking.me in more cities and islands in Greece.</li>
<li>Travelers from all over the world will have the chance to come closer to Greek culture through personalized, fun &amp; authentic experiences.<br/>

</div></div>","""Greeking me"" = To make me feel like a Greek for a while. 
(Of course you won't find this term in a dictionary!)
Our country, Greece, has been in the center of worldwide interest during the last year. The financial crisis is a huge daily obstacle for many people and unemployment hits more and more Greeks, especially the younger ones.
Greeking.me is actually an effort by two young enterpreneurs, that strive to make a difference and build a sustainable venture in Greece. We have faith in our abilities & the potential of the project and remain optimistic about the success of our effort.



But first things first. Let us introduce.
In the last few years, the number of people who visited Greece in order to get a close look at its beauties, history and cultural background has increased. Undoubtedly, there is a great need for quality, innovative and reliable touristic services.

Greeking.me is providing fun, interactive experiences through which people will get to know the real greek culture in an authentic way. Our city, Athens, is a vibrant place, full of contrasts and secrets. Our goal is for you to explore Athens like a local through hands-on, personalized experiences.

The whole idea is based on activities that everyone loves; exploring, cooking, dancing & having fun! Our services address to explorers and visitors who want to feel the real Greek vibe, avoiding the tourist traps.










1.  Quality: All our services are carefully designed in order to offer 
you an experience of exceptional value. It is our aim to create for you 
unique, memorable experiences.


2. Authenticity: Our daily mission is to offer you experiences that exceed your 
expectations. Through our tours and workshops, you will explore the 
authentic character of the city through the eyes of a local. 

3. Excellence: We are committed to being a high performance tourism agency by staying 
focused on total customer satisfaction. We continuously improve our 
processes and ourselves in order to offer you the best service.
4. Customer-focused: It is our aim to provide the highest level of customer service. We 
treat each customer as a friend, building a personal relationship with 
him.




Α few monhs ago, we decided to share our venture with the Indiegogo community, hoping to find support for our new beggining. You see, economy in Greece is exactly what it  looks like.  Building a company from scratch is a big, scary adventure, involving lots of difficulties and expenses. The annual taxation rate for a small business is 26% of the total profit, while you are also obliged to pay in advance a 50 % tax rate of the next year -not to mention the endless bureaucracy and the unfriendly financial environment. Despite all these facts, though, we remain optimistic and feel certain that our idea will offer a great value to anyone who wishes to discover the authentic local life in Athens. This is why we need your support; if we cover our first year expenses with the help of your contribution, we will be able to pay all the taxes, fees & payments that are necessary in order to fully operate our business. We begin now, we begin from scratch & we trust that your help combined with our work will bring to life an exciting new venture in the tourism market of Greece.By supporting us:
You support Greek economy by giving jobs to Greek people. Unemployment is the #1 problem of our country.
You help us inspire young Greeks to make their efforts in their own country, instead of leaving Greece. Crowdfunding is a really great way to kick-off your own venture, so let's inspire more people to use it.
You help us create an outgoing sustainable business model that will create even more jobs in the future. Our vision is to expand Greeking.me in more cities and islands in Greece.
Travelers from all over the world will have the chance to come closer to Greek culture through personalized, fun & authentic experiences.

<p>Eden Urban Farms employs a sustainable agriculture model utilizing indoor farming technology to provide locally grown fresh foods and employment opportunities to urban communities. Growing indoors and maximizing square footage by stacking growing systems, consistently yields double, triple or quadruple the harvest output achieved outdoors without the impact of weather. We can grow and provide locally sourced food products year-round to serve under-resourced communities, local grocers, restaurants, produce wholesalers and more.<br/></p>
<p>Just imagine, no longer would you have to wait for strawberries to be in season or tomatoes, cucumbers, basil and even lettuce. Now you can have fresh, local produce year-round. Just think about the positive social and economic impact that could create!<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need to <b>raise $25,000</b> right away to help secure a growing facility in the city of Detroit and purchase more growing equipment and supplies so we can start growing right away!</p>
<p>This initiative can only work if you help us. We believe in what we're doing and we have had a significant amount of support in the business, social and civic communities, but we need your investment to help reach these goals.<br/></p>We have some great perks to send you if you choose to support our mission. We thank you for even the consideration.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>While we have received great interest from wholesale, commercial and retail grocers that are interested in selling our produce, we feel a responsibility toward feeding our community. <br/></p>
<p>4 million households in Michigan alone live at risk of hunger. 1 in 5 people in Detroit face hunger or lack of food. These numbers don't even take into account how little access there is in the city of Detroit to fresh produce and healthy, organic foods. <br/></p>
<p>For a number of years we have been delivering food to Detroit families through our nonprofit counterpart, mercyworks. It became apparent there were not enough local grocers to service some communities, nor a sustainable food source for under-resourced families. This is why we decided to investigate further into this type of farming in order to create a sustainable source of fresh food.<br/></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary Eden Urban Farms has a vision to revolutionize the way food is grown and distributed around the world. We have an opportunity to make it happen starting right here in Detroit.
Eden Urban Farms employs a sustainable agriculture model utilizing indoor farming technology to provide locally grown fresh foods and employment opportunities to urban communities. Growing indoors and maximizing square footage by stacking growing systems, consistently yields double, triple or quadruple the harvest output achieved outdoors without the impact of weather. We can grow and provide locally sourced food products year-round to serve under-resourced communities, local grocers, restaurants, produce wholesalers and more.
Just imagine, no longer would you have to wait for strawberries to be in season or tomatoes, cucumbers, basil and even lettuce. Now you can have fresh, local produce year-round. Just think about the positive social and economic impact that could create!
  What We Need & What You Get We need to raise $25,000 right away to help secure a growing facility in the city of Detroit and purchase more growing equipment and supplies so we can start growing right away!
This initiative can only work if you help us. We believe in what we're doing and we have had a significant amount of support in the business, social and civic communities, but we need your investment to help reach these goals.We have some great perks to send you if you choose to support our mission. We thank you for even the consideration.
  The Impact While we have received great interest from wholesale, commercial and retail grocers that are interested in selling our produce, we feel a responsibility toward feeding our community. 
4 million households in Michigan alone live at risk of hunger. 1 in 5 people in Detroit face hunger or lack of food. These numbers don't even take into account how little access there is in the city of Detroit to fresh produce and healthy, organic foods. 
For a number of years we have been delivering food to Detroit families through our nonprofit counterpart, mercyworks. It became apparent there were not enough local grocers to service some communities, nor a sustainable food source for under-resourced families. This is why we decided to investigate further into this type of farming in order to create a sustainable source of fresh food.
  Other Ways You Can Help We need your dollars to help us achieve this goal. But that's not all ... whether you could invest $20 or $2,000, we need you to share this campaign with your social networks to help us gain attention and attract other supporters. 
For those of you who can't invest dollars, you can still support us by getting the word out about this campaign and Eden Urban Farms. You can use the sharing tools on this page and tell your social networks about this cool concept that has the potential to change many lives ... and it's happening right here in Detroit.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>We are two entrepreneurs
(Juliana Andrea Acs and Orsolya Danka) and we created <i>L’île de bien-être</i>
at the end of 2014 in Geneva. We wanted to build the same environment as
Julianna had known in Hungary for ten years. <i>L’île de bien-être</i>
is our passion, and we both love our business.</p>
<p>At <i>L’île de bien-être</i>,
we specialize in <b>nail care</b>
(manicure, pedicure, nail art, etc.), in the <b>creation of jewelery</b> (beaded bracelets, stones and crystals,
Swarovski, etc.), in <b>silk painting</b>
(scarves, scarves and mandalas) and in the <b>Aura-Soma®</b>
color therapy.</p>
<p><i>This project will be financed 100% by donations and
funds that we will collect through Indiegogo.</i></p>
<p>Our plan is to
open a large enough center to feature all our activities, so that everyone can
feel all the wellbeing they are looking for and then want to make a return
visit.</p>
<p>To achieve all of
this, we added some ideas to our core business, and we have recently
established new partnerships with suppliers such as Gárdonyi Tea House (the
most famous tea brand in Hungary).</p>
<p>During 2015 we established
partnerships with WeddingPass, Marier.ch, and a guide for recent arrivals to international
organizations.We worked with the Geneva restaurant Vapiano to offer Ladies’
night beauty treatments. We also have been able to partner with the association
<i>Femmes Internationales Murs Brisés</i>
(“International Women Breaking Walls”).This association has made a proposal to
buy a Chromassonic system machine, but we have not yet been able to make this
purchase because we lack space and funds.</p>
<p>With promotions through
BuyClub, DeinDeal, and iStudyMag, and we have been able to increase our
customer base somewhat. However, to maintain the loyalty of our clients, we
need to establish a relationship of trust with them in a location where our
customers will feel good and where they will want to join us frequently.</p>
<p>In 2015, we
became the sole distributors of the Diamond Nails brand throughout Switzerland.</p>
<p>During the
summer of 2015 we decided to add glitter tattoos to our services (tattoos that last
about eight to ten days). For Halloween 2015, we worked for IKEA in Geneva, and
we did tattoos for 150 children. It was a great success!</p>
<p>In early 2016,
we obtained permission from the City of Geneva to participate in city crafts
markets. We will have a booth, which will allow us to better show the public
all our creations on silk. This will give us the opportunity to inform the
public about our new activities and the opening of our new shop.</p>
<p>We envision
having a magnificent booth at the Geneva weddingshowcase in November 2016.</p>
<p>We also will
offer our customers silk painting courses, enabling them to develop and make
unique creations - scarves, sashes, mandalas, paintings, and other items -
entirely by hand.</p>
<p>Currently we
rent a space in another beauty salon. The little space that we own (about 10
m2), which is located in the reception area of the shop, does not allow us to
offer our customers all the services we want to provide.</p>
<p>For this reason,
we have decided to establish ourselves in new premises where we can better
serve our customers and offer diverse and interesting services to our clients.</p>
<p><b>Our planned opening is Friday, 1 July 2016</b> - it is also Julianna’s birthday.</p>

<p>This project
represents a key turning point in our careers, because we want to fully express
our talents and highlight our expertise in the field of welfare, artistic
creation, and customer service. It's time for us to realize our passions and to
share with our clients all our artistic ideas. You can understand that it's
very important for us to find a large enough space so that our activities and creations
can be carried out and displayed in the same location.</p>
<p>We intend to
create a place of life and engagement where our customers blossom fully in total
relaxation. Allowing everyone to develop her creative potential is a priority
for us. That's why we need you to help us achieve this goal and to establish
this unique place in Geneva.</p><p><br/></p>
<h3><b> What we need and what you will get<br/>
</b></h3>
<p>
</p><p>For the realization of our
project, we need 600’700 Euros. This amount will allow us to fully realize our
dream and cover all the costs of the first year.</p>
<p>We would like to reach this
amount in 3 steps:</p>
<p><span>1.<span>  </span></span>Step: We would like to get 250’000
Euros which amount represents approximately all the perks that we put with
limited number.</p>
<p><span>2.<span>  </span></span>Step: When we achieved 250’000 Euros,
we would like to increase the desired amount to 400’000 Euros, and we will add
new perks.</p>
<p><span>3.<span>  </span></span>Step: Once we succeed to obtain 400’000
Euros, we will put, as a last goal 600’700 Euros. This final amount will allow
us to realize everything as it was planned at the beginning.</p>

<p>To continue what
we have started in 2015, it is important for us to move up a notch and to find
a suitable place for our business, one that will allow us both to offer our
services, to organize unique events in Geneva, and to develop new concepts related
to individual well-being, human experience, and better communal living so that
our clients and customers can find a place where warmth prevails and where they
will have the opportunity to escape their daily stress.</p>
<p>This place will also
be suitable for organizing birthday parties or any other kind of events
(family, professional). Other activities can be organized according to demand
and will always be tailormade to fit the occasion.</p><p><br/></p>

that this new place in Geneva can exist and be a place that our customers can
fully enjoy.</i></p><p><i><span>IMPORTANT:  YOU CAN USE ALL PERKS THAT YOU  TAKING YOU BUY, EVEN IF WE WON'T  OBTAIN THE WISHED AMOUNT!</span></i></p><p><i><span>OF COURSE YOU CAN USE NAIL CARE SERVICES THAT YOU BUY  FROM 1 JULY 2016  TO 30 JUNE  2017.</span></i></p><p><i><span>THE SMILEY ASHTRAYS  WILL BE SENT IN AUGUST 2016 OR BEFORE.</span></i></p><p><i><span>IF SOME  PERKS WILL NOT ACHIEVABLE  FROM OUR PART, WE WILL REIMBOURSE IT TO EVERYONE!</span><br/></i></p>

de peinture sur soie, 2015 )<br/><br/><p>Nous
sommes deux personnes indépendantes (Julianna Andrea Acs et Orsolya Danka), et
nous avons créé L’île de bien-être en fin d’année 2014 à Genève. Nous avons
voulu reconstruire le même environnement que Julianna a connu en Hongrie
pendant une dizaine d’années. L'île de bien-être est notre passion, nous
adorons toutes les deux nos activités. </p>
<p>A L'île
de bien-être, nous sommes spécialisées dans l’<b>onglerie</b> (manucure,
pédicure, nail art, etc), dans la <b>création des  bijoux </b>(bijoux en
perles, pierres et cristaux, Swarovski etc), dans l’<b>artisanat</b> : la
peinture sur soie (foulards, écharpes et mandalas) et dans <b>l’Aura-Soma®</b>
(thérapie par la couleur).​</p>
<p><i>Ce projet
se réalisera à 100% par les donations et les fonds que nous allons collecter
grâce à Indiegogo.</i></p>
<p>Notre
projet est d’ouvrir un emplacement suffisamment grand pour développer toutes
nos activités, et afin que chacun puisse ressentir tout le bien-être recherché
et avoir envie de revenir. </p>
<p>Pour
pouvoir réaliser tout ça, nous avons ajouté quelques idées à nos activités de
base, et nous avons établi récemment des nouveaux partenariats avec certains
fournisseurs comme  Gàrdonyi Tea House (la marque de thé le plus célèbre
en Hongrie).</p>
<p>Pendant
l’année 2015 nous avons établi des partenariats avec WeddingPass, Marier.ch, le
Guide des nouveaux-arrivés auprès des Organisations Internationales, nous
étions également partenaires de beauté du restaurant Vapiano à Genève (dans le
cadre des Ladies Nights). Nous avons également pu nous associer avec
l’association Femmes Internationales Murs Brisés.</p>
<p>L’association
Femmes Internationales Murs Brisés nous a fait une proposition d’acheter une
machine de Chromassonic system, mais nous n’avons pas pu réaliser cet achat car
nous manquions d’espace et de fonds.</p>
<p>Grâce aux
promotions avec BuyClub, DeinDeal et iStudyMag nous avons quelque peu augmenté
notre clientèle. Néanmoins, pour fidéliser nos clientes, nous avons besoin
d’établir un lien de confiance avec elles dans un emplacement où nos clientes
se sentent bien, et où elles ont envie de nous rejoindre fréquemment.</p>
<p>Au cours
de l’année 2015, nous sommes devenues distributeurs uniques de la marque
Diamond Nails pour toute la Suisse.</p>
<p>Durant
l’été 2015 nous avons décidé d’ajouter des tatouages à paillettes dans nos
prestations (des tatouages qui restent de 8 à 10 jours environ). Pour Halloween
2015, nous avons travaillé pour IKEA à Genève, et nous avons fait les tatouages
pour 150 enfants, ce fut un véritable succès! </p>
<p>Au début
de l’année 2016, nous avons eu l’autorisation de la part de la Ville de Genève
pour pouvoir participer aux marchés de la ville, ainsi qu’au marché des
créateurs (marché d’artisanat). Nous aurons donc un stand, qui nous permettra
de mieux montrer au public toutes nos créations sur soie. Ce sera pour nous
l’occassion d’informer le public sur nos nouvelles activités et de l’ouverture
de notre nouvelle boutique.</p>
<p>Nous
envisageons d’être présentes avec un magnifique stand au Salon du Mariage en
début de novembre 2016.</p>
<p>Des cours
de peinture sur soie : foulards, écharpes, mandalas, des créations
d’objets cadeaux comme des tableaux, des objets en verre seront aussi proposés
à notre clientèle qui pourra ainsi développer des créations uniques entièrement
faites main.</p>
<p>Actuellement
nous louons une espace dans un autre institut de beauté. Le petit espace que nous
possédons (environ 10 m2) et étant situées à l’entrée, dans « la
réception » de l’institut de beauté, ne nous permet pas d’offrir à notre
clientèle toutes les prestations que nous souhaitons.</p>
<p>C’est
pour cette raison, que nous avons décidé de nous établir dans de nouveaux
locaux où nous pourrons mieux servir notre clientèle, et proposer des
prestations diverses et intéressantes pour nos clientes. </p>
<p><b>Pour
l’ouverture : vendredi 1<sup>er</sup> juillet 2016</b> – c’est aussi l’anniversaire de

<p>Ce projet
représente un tournant essentiel dans nos carrières, car nous avons envie de
pleinement exprimer nos talents et de mettre en exergue nos compétences dans le
domaine du bien-être, de la création artistique, et du service à la clientèle.
C’est le moment pour nous de réaliser nos passions, et de faire partager à nos
clientes toutes nos idées artistiques. Vous comprenez donc, qu’il est très
important pour nous de trouver un emplacement suffisamment grand pour que nos
activités et créations soient réalisées sur ce même lieu.</p>
<p>Nous
avons l’intention de créer un véritable lieu de vie et de rencontres où notre
clientèle s’épanouit pleinement en toute décontraction. Permettre à chacun de
développer son potentiel créatif est une priorité pour nous. C’est pour cette
raison que nous avons besoin de vous pour nous permettre de réaliser ce projet

permettra de concrétiser entièrement notre rêve et couvrira tous les frais de

<p>Nous aimerions atteindre ce
montant en 3 étapes:</p>
<p>1. Etape: Nous aimerions obtenir
250'000 Euros, ce montant représente environ toutes les contreparties que nous
avons mis avec un nombre limité.<br/>
2. Etape: Lorsque nous avons atteint 250'000 Euros, nous aimerions augmenter le
montant souhaité à 400'000 Euros, et nous allons ajouter de nouvelles
contreparties.<br/>
3. Étape: Une fois que nous réussissons à obtenir 400'000 Euros, nous allons
mettre, comme un dernier objectif 600'700 Euros. Ce montant final nous
permettra de réaliser tout comme il était prévu au début.</p>
<p>Nous aimerions vous remercier pour votre aide et votre soutien. En  fonction
de vos dons, nous envisageons de vous offrir certaines de nos prestations. </p>

""If you're looking for an
aesthetic institute that is dedicated entirely to inner as well as outer
beauty, L’île de bien-être (“The Island of Well-Being”) is a haven of peace that will relax you from
head to toe!
Here you will find
everything your heart could wish with respect to personal care. You are a
tattoo fan or a manicure addict (semi-permanent gel or simply your natural
nails)? No worries: The institute offers a range of treatments from manicures
and hair removal to temporary tattoos and massages! Attractive prices and
promotions are offered so that you can make yourself happy.
Or are you interested in
learning something? L’île de bien-être offers a half-day course to learn about
the application of semi-permanent polish. You can also take silk painting courses to discover your
creative potential!
L’île de bien-être takes a
holistic approach. It’s not just a consultation - you will open your “chakras.”
Therapies by the voice of the angel, the various anti-stress techniques used by
this institute will give you self-confidence in no time!
And if you want a souvenir
or just some good luck, you can buy a bracelet, a mandala, or a scarf, even one
in an“energy” color!
This institute has a global
vision of wellbeing that extends beyond mere beauty – it aims to reach the
entire body, heart, and soul. Do not hesitate - make an appointment now at L’île
de bien-être!”
- From IStudyMag, 2016http://www.istudymag.com/fr/good-deals/bonnes-addresses/region/geneve/lile-de-bien-etre/(Painting
course on silk,2015)
We are two entrepreneurs
(Juliana Andrea Acs and Orsolya Danka) and we created L’île de bien-être
at the end of 2014 in Geneva. We wanted to build the same environment as
Julianna had known in Hungary for ten years. L’île de bien-être
is our passion, and we both love our business.
At L’île de bien-être,
we specialize in nail care
(manicure, pedicure, nail art, etc.), in the creation of jewelery (beaded bracelets, stones and crystals,
Swarovski, etc.), in silk painting
(scarves, scarves and mandalas) and in the Aura-Soma®
color therapy.
This project will be financed 100% by donations and
funds that we will collect through Indiegogo.
Our plan is to
open a large enough center to feature all our activities, so that everyone can
feel all the wellbeing they are looking for and then want to make a return
visit.
To achieve all of
this, we added some ideas to our core business, and we have recently
established new partnerships with suppliers such as Gárdonyi Tea House (the
most famous tea brand in Hungary).
During 2015 we established
partnerships with WeddingPass, Marier.ch, and a guide for recent arrivals to international
organizations.We worked with the Geneva restaurant Vapiano to offer Ladies’
night beauty treatments. We also have been able to partner with the association
Femmes Internationales Murs Brisés
(“International Women Breaking Walls”).This association has made a proposal to
buy a Chromassonic system machine, but we have not yet been able to make this
purchase because we lack space and funds.
With promotions through
BuyClub, DeinDeal, and iStudyMag, and we have been able to increase our
customer base somewhat. However, to maintain the loyalty of our clients, we
need to establish a relationship of trust with them in a location where our
customers will feel good and where they will want to join us frequently.
In 2015, we
became the sole distributors of the Diamond Nails brand throughout Switzerland.
During the
summer of 2015 we decided to add glitter tattoos to our services (tattoos that last
about eight to ten days). For Halloween 2015, we worked for IKEA in Geneva, and
we did tattoos for 150 children. It was a great success!
In early 2016,
we obtained permission from the City of Geneva to participate in city crafts
markets. We will have a booth, which will allow us to better show the public
all our creations on silk. This will give us the opportunity to inform the
public about our new activities and the opening of our new shop.
We envision
having a magnificent booth at the Geneva weddingshowcase in November 2016.
We also will
offer our customers silk painting courses, enabling them to develop and make
unique creations - scarves, sashes, mandalas, paintings, and other items -
entirely by hand.
Currently we
rent a space in another beauty salon. The little space that we own (about 10
m2), which is located in the reception area of the shop, does not allow us to
offer our customers all the services we want to provide.
For this reason,
we have decided to establish ourselves in new premises where we can better
serve our customers and offer diverse and interesting services to our clients.
Our planned opening is Friday, 1 July 2016 - it is also Julianna’s birthday.

(Eternal favorite: Diamond Nails33)
This project
represents a key turning point in our careers, because we want to fully express
our talents and highlight our expertise in the field of welfare, artistic
creation, and customer service. It's time for us to realize our passions and to
share with our clients all our artistic ideas. You can understand that it's
very important for us to find a large enough space so that our activities and creations
can be carried out and displayed in the same location.
We intend to
create a place of life and engagement where our customers blossom fully in total
relaxation. Allowing everyone to develop her creative potential is a priority
for us. That's why we need you to help us achieve this goal and to establish
this unique place in Geneva.
 What we need and what you will get


For the realization of our
project, we need 600’700 Euros. This amount will allow us to fully realize our
dream and cover all the costs of the first year.
We would like to reach this
amount in 3 steps:
1.  Step: We would like to get 250’000
Euros which amount represents approximately all the perks that we put with
limited number.
2.  Step: When we achieved 250’000 Euros,
we would like to increase the desired amount to 400’000 Euros, and we will add
new perks.
3.  Step: Once we succeed to obtain 400’000
Euros, we will put, as a last goal 600’700 Euros. This final amount will allow
us to realize everything as it was planned at the beginning.
We thank you for your help
and support. Depending on your donations, we plan to offer some of our
services.
We will use the funds
to establish and fully begin our business.
This
will cover all the costs of the first year:
- Funding for the salon space and 6 months deposit
- First year’s rent
- Insurance
- Equipment, furniture, minimum stock for each area of
activity
- Development of existing website and creation of new
websites for Magic Silk - Silk Magic, Aura-Soma®, Diamond Nails and Gárdonyi Tea
House (including an online shop for each)
- Beginning employee salaries start at
- Advertising costs
- Representation expenses (for example, legal and
accounting fees)
- Business Travel
- Staff training 
- Indiegogo costs

 The new  L’île de bien-être will  feature the following areas:

- Nail Space
We will offer
the same care as we do now: care of hands and feet, application of false nails
and nail art, etc.
- Diamond Nails space (included within
nail salon)
Showroom with all Diamond Nails products

The space will be accessible to everyone, with special

Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/magicsilksoiemagique/

(Silk picture )- Aura-Soma® space
Showroom with all Aura-Soma® products
Base stock for the sale of Aura-Soma® products
We will carry out consultations in this room as well as the cleaning of
chakras, “Angel” therapies, therapies for healing the inner child, etc.

- Chromassonic system space
We will establish a space with a Chromassonic system machine for clients
who consider that colors are a real tool for relaxation and bring an added
dimension to their welfare.
http://www.fimb-asso.org/fimb/forme-a-sante/la-chromassonic
- Massage area
We also will have a table for waxing treatments. This table can be used
as well by guest therapists,who will be able to offer their own services and
bring real added value to our business.
- Solarium
A solarium with two cabins is envisaged.
- Tea room and bar area with a
terrace (if possible)
Open to our customers and the general publicServing Gárdonyi Tea House tea (http://www.gardonyiteahaz.eu/index.php/en/) and Nespresso coffee (TBC) or otherwise
We will also offer some sweet and savory specialties that will delight
you.

( Gàrdonyi Tea House )

- Child care space
So that parents can peacefully enjoy the benefits that L’île de
bien-être will offer, we
will offer child care with professional babysitters to welcome their children.
Depending upon how much funding we will be able to
raise (and we hope for the most generous funding possible), we will adapt the
development of our business and will proceed step by step to increase the value
of the space that we find - we need a place with a minimum space of 200 m².
 The impact
Your contributions to the realization of the opening
of the new L’île de bien-être will help us welcome our new
customers who will want to have a good time with us, and develop their
creativity.
To continue what
we have started in 2015, it is important for us to move up a notch and to find
a suitable place for our business, one that will allow us both to offer our
services, to organize unique events in Geneva, and to develop new concepts related
to individual well-being, human experience, and better communal living so that
our clients and customers can find a place where warmth prevails and where they
will have the opportunity to escape their daily stress.
This place will also
be suitable for organizing birthday parties or any other kind of events
(family, professional). Other activities can be organized according to demand
and will always be tailormade to fit the occasion.
 Risks and Challenges
Our life experience had shown us that human encounters
and the development of potential interactivity between individuals can help
everyone to achieve. This is our goal through this project. We are well aware
that this project is ambitious, but we will devote all our passion and energy so
that this new place in Geneva can exist and be a place that our customers can
fully enjoy.IMPORTANT:  YOU CAN USE ALL PERKS THAT YOU  TAKING YOU BUY, EVEN IF WE WON'T  OBTAIN THE WISHED AMOUNT!OF COURSE YOU CAN USE NAIL CARE SERVICES THAT YOU BUY  FROM 1 JULY 2016  TO 30 JUNE  2017.THE SMILEY ASHTRAYS  WILL BE SENT IN AUGUST 2016 OR BEFORE.IF SOME  PERKS WILL NOT ACHIEVABLE  FROM OUR PART, WE WILL REIMBOURSE IT TO EVERYONE!

( Cours
de peinture sur soie, 2015 )Nous
sommes deux personnes indépendantes (Julianna Andrea Acs et Orsolya Danka), et
nous avons créé L’île de bien-être en fin d’année 2014 à Genève. Nous avons
voulu reconstruire le même environnement que Julianna a connu en Hongrie
pendant une dizaine d’années. L'île de bien-être est notre passion, nous
adorons toutes les deux nos activités. 
A L'île
de bien-être, nous sommes spécialisées dans l’onglerie (manucure,
pédicure, nail art, etc), dans la création des  bijoux (bijoux en
perles, pierres et cristaux, Swarovski etc), dans l’artisanat : la
peinture sur soie (foulards, écharpes et mandalas) et dans l’Aura-Soma®
(thérapie par la couleur).​
Ce projet
se réalisera à 100% par les donations et les fonds que nous allons collecter
grâce à Indiegogo.
Notre
projet est d’ouvrir un emplacement suffisamment grand pour développer toutes
nos activités, et afin que chacun puisse ressentir tout le bien-être recherché
et avoir envie de revenir. 
Pour
pouvoir réaliser tout ça, nous avons ajouté quelques idées à nos activités de
base, et nous avons établi récemment des nouveaux partenariats avec certains
fournisseurs comme  Gàrdonyi Tea House (la marque de thé le plus célèbre
en Hongrie).
Pendant
l’année 2015 nous avons établi des partenariats avec WeddingPass, Marier.ch, le
Guide des nouveaux-arrivés auprès des Organisations Internationales, nous
étions également partenaires de beauté du restaurant Vapiano à Genève (dans le
cadre des Ladies Nights). Nous avons également pu nous associer avec
l’association Femmes Internationales Murs Brisés.
L’association
Femmes Internationales Murs Brisés nous a fait une proposition d’acheter une
machine de Chromassonic system, mais nous n’avons pas pu réaliser cet achat car
nous manquions d’espace et de fonds.
Grâce aux
promotions avec BuyClub, DeinDeal et iStudyMag nous avons quelque peu augmenté
notre clientèle. Néanmoins, pour fidéliser nos clientes, nous avons besoin
d’établir un lien de confiance avec elles dans un emplacement où nos clientes
se sentent bien, et où elles ont envie de nous rejoindre fréquemment.
Au cours
de l’année 2015, nous sommes devenues distributeurs uniques de la marque
Diamond Nails pour toute la Suisse.
Durant
l’été 2015 nous avons décidé d’ajouter des tatouages à paillettes dans nos
prestations (des tatouages qui restent de 8 à 10 jours environ). Pour Halloween
2015, nous avons travaillé pour IKEA à Genève, et nous avons fait les tatouages
pour 150 enfants, ce fut un véritable succès! 
Au début
de l’année 2016, nous avons eu l’autorisation de la part de la Ville de Genève
pour pouvoir participer aux marchés de la ville, ainsi qu’au marché des
créateurs (marché d’artisanat). Nous aurons donc un stand, qui nous permettra
de mieux montrer au public toutes nos créations sur soie. Ce sera pour nous
l’occassion d’informer le public sur nos nouvelles activités et de l’ouverture
de notre nouvelle boutique.
Nous
envisageons d’être présentes avec un magnifique stand au Salon du Mariage en
début de novembre 2016.
Des cours
de peinture sur soie : foulards, écharpes, mandalas, des créations
d’objets cadeaux comme des tableaux, des objets en verre seront aussi proposés
à notre clientèle qui pourra ainsi développer des créations uniques entièrement
faites main.
Actuellement
nous louons une espace dans un autre institut de beauté. Le petit espace que nous
possédons (environ 10 m2) et étant situées à l’entrée, dans « la
réception » de l’institut de beauté, ne nous permet pas d’offrir à notre
clientèle toutes les prestations que nous souhaitons.
C’est
pour cette raison, que nous avons décidé de nous établir dans de nouveaux
locaux où nous pourrons mieux servir notre clientèle, et proposer des
prestations diverses et intéressantes pour nos clientes. 
Pour
l’ouverture : vendredi 1er juillet 2016 – c’est aussi l’anniversaire de
Julianna.( Favori éternel: Diamond Nails
33 )

Ce projet
représente un tournant essentiel dans nos carrières, car nous avons envie de
pleinement exprimer nos talents et de mettre en exergue nos compétences dans le
domaine du bien-être, de la création artistique, et du service à la clientèle.
C’est le moment pour nous de réaliser nos passions, et de faire partager à nos
clientes toutes nos idées artistiques. Vous comprenez donc, qu’il est très
important pour nous de trouver un emplacement suffisamment grand pour que nos
activités et créations soient réalisées sur ce même lieu.
Nous
avons l’intention de créer un véritable lieu de vie et de rencontres où notre
clientèle s’épanouit pleinement en toute décontraction. Permettre à chacun de
développer son potentiel créatif est une priorité pour nous. C’est pour cette
raison que nous avons besoin de vous pour nous permettre de réaliser ce projet
et de faire vivre ce lieu unique à Genève.

 Ce dont nous avons besoin et 

 ce que vous
obtiendrez

Pour la réalisation de notre projet, nous avons besoin d'un montant de 600'700.- Euros. Ce montant nous
permettra de concrétiser entièrement notre rêve et couvrira tous les frais de
la première année.
Nous aimerions atteindre ce
montant en 3 étapes:
1. Etape: Nous aimerions obtenir
250'000 Euros, ce montant représente environ toutes les contreparties que nous
avons mis avec un nombre limité.
2. Etape: Lorsque nous avons atteint 250'000 Euros, nous aimerions augmenter le
montant souhaité à 400'000 Euros, et nous allons ajouter de nouvelles
contreparties.
3. Étape: Une fois que nous réussissons à obtenir 400'000 Euros, nous allons
mettre, comme un dernier objectif 600'700 Euros. Ce montant final nous
permettra de réaliser tout comme il était prévu au début.
Nous aimerions vous remercier pour votre aide et votre soutien. En  fonction
de vos dons, nous envisageons de vous offrir certaines de nos prestations. 
Nous allons utiliser les fonds pour nous établir et commencer
pleinement notre activité. Ce
montant couvrira tous les frais de la première année:

des fonds d'arcade, et 6 mois de caution
- Loyers

envie de passer un bon moment avec nous, et de développer leur créativité.

continuer ce que nous avons déjà entrepris en 2015, il est important pour nous
de passer à la vitesse supérieure et de trouver un endroit adéquat pour nous,
qui nous permettra à la fois de réaliser nos prestations, et d’organiser des
évènements uniques à Genève et de développer de nouveaux concepts autour du
bien-être individuel, de l’expérience humaine, du mieux-vivre ensemble afin que
nos clientes et clients puissent trouver un lieu où la chaleur humaine règne,
et où ils auront la possibilité de rompre avec leur quotidien.
Cet
endroit sera aussi adapté pour organiser des fêtes d’anniversaire, ou tout autres
sortes d’évènements (familiaux, professionnels). Certaines animations pourront
être organisés en fonction de la demande et ce sera toujours de sur-mesure.

The USA’s attacking midfielder possesses some rare qualities in her ability to beat players on the dribble and to strike on goal from distance. As fit as she’s ever been, Lloyd is an integral player in the USA’s attack. She scored the winning goal in the 2008 Olympic Gold Medal in overtime to beat Brazil and scored the only two goals in the 2012 Olympic Gold Medal Game vs Japan. Lloyd is the highest scoring midfielder for the US Women's National Team. Carli is a great athlete, great role model, and a great woman. In an interview, Carli was asked to describe herself using five words. She answered, ""I am dedicated, relentless, motivated, hard working, and committed. </span>

Friedmann </i></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">has combined an interest in science with a talent in writing to become an award-winning science journalist. Starting out, her dream was to become a marine biologist but in the 1970s, there were few role models for women pursuing STEM careers and outright hostility from some of her male professors in college.</span><br/>
</div>
<p>She graduated with a dual degree in journalism and biology in the early days of the computer industry and found tremendous opportunities because she understood technology and could write. </p>
<p>In a career spanning 30 years, she has written on topics ranging from astrophysics to zoology for newspapers, magazines, online, and in books. Along the way, she has worked with, interviewed, or otherwise rubbed elbows with Nobel laureates; luminaries such as ocean explorer Jean-Michel Cousteau, chimpanzee expert Jane Goodall, and astronaut Sally Ride; author Michael Crichton; filmmaker James Cameron; and actress animal lover BettyWhite.</p>
<p>Lynne is among a handful of journalists named a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which cited her “significant contributions to the public communication of science and technology.” </p>

<p><b><i>From the movie ""Field of Dreams"" ~ If you build it, they will come. </i></b></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Building Great Women INSPIRE has been a dream of mine for a number of years. I have a passion for women, and girls, to see a dynamic world filled with possibilities. Building anything of significance comes with challenges but I have a core belief that for every challenge there is a SOLUTION. When I encounter challenges building this project, I will create solutions. With over thirty years experience, I'm confident in my abilities and my passion for this project. Additionally, I will seek the advice of my personal network and IndieGoGo supporters to cope with any obstacles that may come my way. The goal is clear...Over the next 60 days, begin the ""Build"" of the Great Women INSPIRE™ community and website. The job will be done. </span><br/></p>

Here are our first two Great Women INSPIRE honorees:

Sports ~ Carli Lloyd  (born July 16, 1982) is an American professional soccer midfielder who currently plays for Houston Dash in the National Women's Soccer League and the United States women's national soccer team. The USA’s attacking midfielder possesses some rare qualities in her ability to beat players on the dribble and to strike on goal from distance. As fit as she’s ever been, Lloyd is an integral player in the USA’s attack. She scored the winning goal in the 2008 Olympic Gold Medal in overtime to beat Brazil and scored the only two goals in the 2012 Olympic Gold Medal Game vs Japan. Lloyd is the highest scoring midfielder for the US Women's National Team. Carli is a great athlete, great role model, and a great woman. In an interview, Carli was asked to describe herself using five words. She answered, ""I am dedicated, relentless, motivated, hard working, and committed. 
Carli Lloyd ~ You INSPIRE Us!




Science and Technology ~ Lynne T. Friedmann has combined an interest in science with a talent in writing to become an award-winning science journalist. Starting out, her dream was to become a marine biologist but in the 1970s, there were few role models for women pursuing STEM careers and outright hostility from some of her male professors in college.

She graduated with a dual degree in journalism and biology in the early days of the computer industry and found tremendous opportunities because she understood technology and could write. 
In a career spanning 30 years, she has written on topics ranging from astrophysics to zoology for newspapers, magazines, online, and in books. Along the way, she has worked with, interviewed, or otherwise rubbed elbows with Nobel laureates; luminaries such as ocean explorer Jean-Michel Cousteau, chimpanzee expert Jane Goodall, and astronaut Sally Ride; author Michael Crichton; filmmaker James Cameron; and actress animal lover BettyWhite.
Lynne is among a handful of journalists named a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which cited her “significant contributions to the public communication of science and technology.” 
Lynne Friedmann ~ You INSPIRES Us!

<p>We are Ahmad Al-Jamal and Hussam Taha; the co-founders of
Restored. While we used to lead regular everyday jobs in the past; Ahmad was a
Junior CRM Executive at a logistics service company and Hussam was a Language
Assistant at a military training institute, we now focus all of our efforts on
Restored as on-going experiment to show the world and, more specifically, the

</p><p align=""center""><b>What is Restored?
Or Why Palestine Needs Restored</b></p>
<p>Restored is all about recycling and renovation. We restore
old furniture by taking each piece on its own; by taking the necessary steps to
improve its quality, hone its beauty and possibly even re-invent it into
something unexpected. Moreover, it is also our priority to retain the legacy
and history of every piece by focusing on the small handmade details,
birthmarks if you will, that bookend the uniqueness of each one.</p>
<p>It all began last summer while we were moving into a new
apartment. We were aware of how expensive new furniture is, and so the idea of
restoring old furniture made sense to us while furnishing a home on a budget. We
created a tiny workshop for us at the apartment, used whatever tools we could
get our hands on and started experimenting. We were instantly hooked on the
possibilities, and couldn’t wait to make more and more. Our friends were
impressed too and some even asked us to restore their old furniture for them
before it all accumulated into a friend suggesting to us that we participate in
the weekly flea market in the Old City of Ramallah, which in retrospect was
when Restored really came to be.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452534862/ieufmu59xex5mgydd11b.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452537259/v1kxuulnicdaodhdobbi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452535192/i77yydx8c8nu1vyk5mth.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452536592/o38zv2ekqrza0gvfamwc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452536190/jprhpjmcrgjsg608fb1a.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And so we got on a bus one day and headed to Nablus where
there is a big flea market for old furniture. We were nervous while choosing pieces to restore because we didn’t know how people would
view our work. Fortunately, however, our first flea market was quite the
success. People were intrigued by what they saw, and were also surprised by the
fact that recycling could be associated with items they perceived as beautiful
and reliable.</p>
<p>This strong reaction prompted us to work harder the
following weeks; we bought some new tools and challenged ourselves to work with
different, and in some cases more complex, types of furniture. Within a few
weeks, we had brought furniture from streets and flea markets all over
Palestine, including ones in faraway cities such as Nablus, Hebron and
Qalqilya, back to Ramallah to restore them and prove to people that there is an
abundance of potential in what we do, and that it CAN be a viable alternative
to buying new furniture. We had worked on chairs, stools, tables, desks,
closets, couches, candlesticks and so much more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>
</b></p><p><b>
</b></p><p>Once the flea markets had come to a halt, we made the
decision to carry on with Restored and turn it into its own entity. Restored
felt bigger than just a booth at the flea market because of the strong
reactions we’ve received from the community here; a lot of people started
donating their old furniture instead of throwing it away, so that other people
would enjoy it. Moreover, a lot of people who had seen pictures of our
furniture on the internet and approached us couldn’t tell that it was recycled;
they thought it was new, and were intrigued by the colors and designs that we’d
chosen. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452536314/ltqybab1ubkwbt6qm4fy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452537195/kd69oy6faue1bqicag9d.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452536344/taw9whw1n2rrpap65dw6.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452537126/fqulqx4tviqvz41i1fzd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452535234/yd3ivonguyswvp14onhh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452536967/cekarozj1gvtygwftur7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><b>
</b><p>All of that showed us that people were opening up to
recycling and the other concepts that Restored entails. As a result, we decided
to leave our jobs and focus on fulfilling the full potential of Restored to
become a pioneer in the recycled furniture business in Palestine. Since then,
we’ve improved the quality of our tools, rented a small workshop on the
outskirts of the city and started displaying our products on the internet to
reach more people and strengthen the perception of recycling in Palestine.</p>
<p>And now at this point, we feel like we have given Restored
everything we can as individuals, and now we need to take a big step in order
to reap bigger results.</p>
<p>

<p align=""center""><b><br/></b></p><p align=""center""><b>Why A Car Is The

pieces. This process, at times, takes more time than restoring the pieces and
delivering them, combined. We either rely on finding furniture whose owners had
disposed of, or by going to old furniture flea markets in other cities, such as
Nablus, which is one hour away and Hebron, which is two hours away. Not only
does that take up a lot of valuable time, but it also poses a big financial
burden on Restored as transportation costs are quite high, particularly for
vehicles capable of carrying the amounts of furniture we need. Whether it were
for long distances, such as when we visit other cities, or even when we are in
Ramallah and we find old furniture around, we still have to pay for the full
service of the vehicle even if we were only moving one piece of furniture.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452537754/qybptalwkiyyubchdjnx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452599005/rkaoy6mrjuh0l5lcgzq2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>As a result, it has become vital for Restored to have a car
in order for us to move up. Not only would we reduce costs significantly, but
we’d also be able to pick up any piece of furniture lying around no matter where
or when, and we’d have much more time to work on them and perfect them.
Subsequently, Restored would become far more effective and productive in terms
of normalizing and popularizing recycling in the Palestinian community, by
reaching more people and leaving them all satisfied with the quality and
affordability of our work.</p>
<p>Our aim is that people would no longer associate recycling
with tin cans and plastic, but with the vibrant possibilities of restored furniture.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452537660/hk0msdov1hixkdzl8gtp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><i>""This piece, for example, was used as a storage box for weapons by the Israeli army before its transformation into a jewelry box.""</i></p><p><i></i><br/></p>

It is simple to use, insert the pin into the hole on a fuel dispensing nozzle, push the latch back and the bowser will automatically fill your vehicles fuel tank - check out the video above!
Why did we invent this? My aunt was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and has been living with this terrible disease for many years. Her condition has deteriorated and she has lost the ability to undertake many simple daily tasks, such as holding a cup of tea.
A few years ago she was talking to me about the simple things that become more difficult, such as filling your car with petrol. It would be some months before I found a solution, too late for my aunt, but not too late for others.

<p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
<p>Hello, thank you so much for
visiting my campaign. My name is Andrew and I am finishing up two degrees, both
fire service related in hopes to be a wildland firefighter. I am a freelance
graphic designer and wildlife enthusiast. It was my graphic design skills that
won the Michigan Beekeepers' Association’s “new logo” contest in early 2011. I
was awarded a $100 certificate at Dadant bee supplier, which was used to
purchase my very first beekeeping equipment.</p>
<p><b>THE UNFORTUNATE LOSS OF MY HONEY BEES</b></p>
<p>What started as a hobby quickly became a small successful business,
producing hundreds of pounds of honey. Two additional hives were established in
2012. However, at the end of that year while on vacation, my vehicle that was
recently purchased specifically to haul bee colonies and to store equipment was
stolen. The vehicle was never reclaimed and my insurance didn’t cover theft.
This unfortunate loss put my business far behind, and to make matters worse
some of my colonies came into contact with pesticide that was later traced to a
local gardener. I slowly lost my bees and a decision was made to close the
business until I could recover.</p>
<p><b>I NEED YOUR HELP</b></p>
<p>It’s now 2016, four long years
after my loss and I have yet been able to replace my beehives and honey bee
colonies due to financial hardship. With the help of YOU I am hoping to at
least get one complete beehive with a colony of bees and the tools and
equipment needed to manage them.</p>
<p><b>Any financial support you provide
will go toward:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Complete beehive = $140</li>
<li>Frames and foundation = $170</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Package of bees = $115</li>
<li>Bee suit with gloves, hat and veil = $110</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Bee smoker = $45</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Bee brush and hive tool = $20</li>
</ul>
<p>The estimate for all of this is
$600, which could produce almost 100 pounds of honey. If we reach our first
goal, a second goal will be opened where additional funds will go towards honey
extracting and bottling equipment, branding, and more beehives. </p>
<p><b>THE BENEFITS OF BEEKEEPING</b></p>
<p>Not only do your funds help me
restore my business, you are also helping our environment as honey bees play an
essential role in pollination and fertilization of many crops. According to the
United States Department of Agriculture, Bee pollination is responsible for 15
billion dollars in added crop value.</p>
<span>
<p><b>PERKS</b></p></span>Below are your rewards:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>$1 – You will receive a
personalized email thanking you!</li>
<li>$5 – Receive one tube of my high
quality, petroleum-free lip balm! My lip balm is made with only the highest
quality ingredients, including beeswax produced from the honey bees themselves!</li>
<li>$10 – Receive 1 lb of 100%
natural, unheated and unfiltered wildflower honey! Honey will be extracted,

Mbiri aims at supporting community enterprises through direct sourcing of natural ingredients for its products. I am Namibian and I spent most of my school holidays in the Namibian desert and I have always had a passion for the desert, its plants and the people.</p>

<p><i>Image: Myself and Kaveuruamo Mupurua, one of the harvesters.</i></p>
<p>My mother, through the NGO (IRDNC) she works for, started a project with the Himba women in Kaokoland where she was responsible for the research into the traditional use of indigenous plants and also investigated ways in which these resources could be sustainably utilized. The focus of her work was on the <i>Commiphora wildii</i> plant which naturally exudes a resin. The Himba women have used this resin for centuries in their traditional perfume and now they commercially harvest the resin and earn an income. After harvesting, the resin is sent to the Opuwo Processing Facility, which is owned by the harvesters, to extract the Namibian Myrrh essential oil. You can have a look at their website: <a href=""http://www.scentsofnamibia.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.scentsofnamibia.com</a></p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><i>Image: A Himba women harvesting Omumbiri resin.</i></span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Mbiri was launched to support this enterprise. Mbiri buys the essential oil directly from the factory and uses it in every product. This means Mbiri products create a demand for the oil and so more resin needs to be harvested, thereby supporting the viability of the community enterprise. The resource is abundant and the harvesting practices ensure its sustainability. My passion for this desert and its people motivated me to create a 100% natural skincare range that supports this enterprise. The resin is </span>traditionally known as Omumbiri, hence the name Mbiri. <br/></p>

<p></p>
<p><i>Image: The Mbiri products.</i></p>
<p>Mbiri now needs to expand the range to further support the project. However there are costs attached to this - packaging, formulations, design, endorsements and of course purchasing the raw ingredients as well as manufacturing. A larger range of Mbiri products can have a bigger impact in this competitive industry and in turn generate more income.</p>

<i>Image: Namibian Myrrh resin.</i>
</div><div>
<p>The community enterprise is struggling to create a big enough demand for the essential oil. Without demand they cannot reach the maximum production capacity, this is why Mbiri needs to purchase more oil. With your contribution Mbiri will be able to do this and in turn you will be supporting these Namibian communities. </p>

<i>Image: Kata Tjivinda holding one of the Mbiri products. She was one of the very first harvesters involved in the Omumbiri project.</i>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul>
<li>Mbiri is hoping to raise USD10 000 to expand the range and support the community factory by giving them half of the contributions from this campaign. The expansion will introduce two new products, a body oil and a hair oil. This product development will include the costs of formulations, packaging design, purchasing packaging including labels, buying raw ingredients, paying for endorsements and of course manufacturing. The money will be used to buy Namibian Myrrh oil from the community factory. Of every dollar that is contributed to this campaign, USD0.50 will be given to the community owned facility. The community factory needs this money to pay harvesters and to cover their operational costs. This means that if all funds are raised Mbiri will give the facility USD5000.</li>
</ul>

<i>Image: Staff members at the community owned processing facility with baskets of Omumbiri resin. (Left: Ngavekare Tjiraso  Right: Jeckey Kasaona)</i>
</div>
<ul> <li>Every person that contributes to this campaign will receive proof of the funds being given to the community facility and will also be given recognition on the Mbiri Facebook page and website. The real perk about this campaign is the opportunity to support a community owned factory, the harvesters and their incredible story.</li> <li>Without the full funding Mbiri will not be able to expand the range which is imperative in generating a successful skincare range. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <ul> <li>Your contribution will support a business that supports communities. The harvesters harvest during the driest time of the year as this is when the resin is naturally exuded. This means they earn an income during times when there is a shortage of food. Women use the money earned from harvesting to buy food and access healthcare. The portion of the money raised that will be donated to the community owned processing facility will be used to increase the intake of resin during the next harvest season. This means that income earned by households involved in harvesting activities will be greater and make a significant contribution to the food security of these communities who are currently affected by the extreme drought conditions. </li>

<ul> <li>Mbiri was launched in April 2015 and has seen great interest in the products thus far, however with a small range Mbiri's reach is limited. By creating two more products Mbiri can have a larger impact on sales and therefore purchase more oil from the community factory.</li> <li>Growing up with this community project has engrained a passion in me for Namibia and its people. With your support we can make this community enterprise viable and bring this story to the world.</li> </ul>

</div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <ul> <li>The skincare industry is highly competitive and Mbiri faces the challenge of squeezing into this market. However with a great story and 100% natural ingredients there is a definitive gap for Mbiri. People want to buy a story not just a product, and with people becoming more conscious of what they use on their skin Mbiri provides them with a safe and natural product. Mbiri is also registered with The Vegan Society and endorsed by Beauty Without Cruelty, as well as being an accredited partner of Phytotrade Africa, which a fair-trade initiative. The story of Namibia will intrigue people and create curiosity. Mbiri only consists of 4 products and it is already on shelves in Namibia and South Africa. There is a definitive interest in the product, but now, with your help, Mbiri can make an even bigger impact. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you cannot make a contribution please share this story with friends and family to get the word out there.

My passion for this desert and its people motivated me to create a 100% natural skincare range that supports this enterprise. The resin is traditionally known as Omumbiri, hence the name Mbiri.

Mbiri now needs to expand the range to further support the project. However there are costs attached to this - packaging, formulations, design, endorsements and of course purchasing the raw ingredients as well as manufacturing. A larger range of Mbiri products can have a bigger impact in this competitive industry and in turn generate more income.

The community enterprise is struggling to create a big enough demand for the essential oil. Without demand they cannot reach the maximum production capacity, this is why Mbiri needs to purchase more oil. With your contribution Mbiri will be able to do this and in turn you will be supporting these Namibian communities.

  What We Need & What You Get 
Mbiri is hoping to raise USD10 000 to expand the range and support the community factory by giving them half of the contributions from this campaign. The expansion will introduce two new products, a body oil and a hair oil. This product development will include the costs of formulations, packaging design, purchasing packaging including labels, buying raw ingredients, paying for endorsements and of course manufacturing. The money will be used to buy Namibian Myrrh oil from the community factory. Of every dollar that is contributed to this campaign, USD0.50 will be given to the community owned facility. The community factory needs this money to pay harvesters and to cover their operational costs. This means that if all funds are raised Mbiri will give the facility USD5000.

 Every person that contributes to this campaign will receive proof of the funds being given to the community facility and will also be given recognition on the Mbiri Facebook page and website. The real perk about this campaign is the opportunity to support a community owned factory, the harvesters and their incredible story. Without the full funding Mbiri will not be able to expand the range which is imperative in generating a successful skincare range.     The Impact  Your contribution will support a business that supports communities. The harvesters harvest during the driest time of the year as this is when the resin is naturally exuded. This means they earn an income during times when there is a shortage of food. Women use the money earned from harvesting to buy food and access healthcare. The portion of the money raised that will be donated to the community owned processing facility will be used to increase the intake of resin during the next harvest season. This means that income earned by households involved in harvesting activities will be greater and make a significant contribution to the food security of these communities who are currently affected by the extreme drought conditions.

 Mbiri was launched in April 2015 and has seen great interest in the products thus far, however with a small range Mbiri's reach is limited. By creating two more products Mbiri can have a larger impact on sales and therefore purchase more oil from the community factory. Growing up with this community project has engrained a passion in me for Namibia and its people. With your support we can make this community enterprise viable and bring this story to the world.

   Risks & Challenges  The skincare industry is highly competitive and Mbiri faces the challenge of squeezing into this market. However with a great story and 100% natural ingredients there is a definitive gap for Mbiri. People want to buy a story not just a product, and with people becoming more conscious of what they use on their skin Mbiri provides them with a safe and natural product. Mbiri is also registered with The Vegan Society and endorsed by Beauty Without Cruelty, as well as being an accredited partner of Phytotrade Africa, which a fair-trade initiative. The story of Namibia will intrigue people and create curiosity. Mbiri only consists of 4 products and it is already on shelves in Namibia and South Africa. There is a definitive interest in the product, but now, with your help, Mbiri can make an even bigger impact.     Other Ways You Can Help If you cannot make a contribution please share this story with friends and family to get the word out there. Mbiri is about Africa and its communities so please assist me in telling their stories.

 for the first time, users will be prompted to sign in with Facebook 
accounts. Once signed in, the user will be prompted to give permission 
to use location services (please do keep in mind that this application 
will not work without location services). The application will take data
 such as your name, age, gender</span><span>,</span><span> and Facebook Page likes</span><span>; </span><span>H</span><span>owever, their are some details that the user will have to fill in </span><span>themselves</span><span>.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435188080/wkym65l8cboaukvlvg68.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

well as French and Hindi, he would simply set the filters above and save
 the settings. Similar to our Explore Filters, we also have Request 
Filters, which are just slightly more basic and only involve filtering 
by the gender, age and the spoken language. These filters will control </span><span>who</span><span>
 you can see and who can see your profile, respectively. To expand, the

 our planet and has revolutionized communication. We hope to take the 
communication boom one step further by creating an experience where the 
user truly gets to connect to people of different cultures and 
backgrounds. </span><span>Through the</span><span> aim
 of providing an immersive experience in global communities around the 
world, we hope that people will inspire each other to change the world. </span></p><p><b><span>Our Mission</span></b></p><p><span>We
 believe the best way to make a change in the world is to inspire people
 around us to join us towards the same goal. Our mission is to do 
everything we can to make the biggest possible change in the world </span><span>and inspire the world to do the same. </span></p><p><b><span>Our role</span></b></p><p><span>Don’t get us </span><span>wrong,</span><span>
 our users won’t be the only ones doing something for a better tomorrow.
 While our primary role is to provide the users with the best possible 
experience, we do have another main role: to use a portion of our 
revenue to help solve the multitude of problems we are faced with </span><span>today. </span><span>From
 our very first profit to every following profit stream, we are always 
going to put 50% of the cash into savings so that one day, we will be 
able to open up our own development fund. This fund will use </span><span>Trybo</span><span> resources to help humanity in the battles against poverty, hunger, preventable diseases, illiteracy and more.</span><span>
 Today, many corporations sometimes deviate from their focus of feeding 
consumers and give up some portions of their profit to aid certain 
causes or to play a role in solving certain problems. </span><span>Trybo</span><span> is going to be a corporation that will be dedicated to making change across our planet. </span></p><p><b><span>Why do we need more funds?</span></b></p><p><span>The seed money we </span><span>received</span><span> is just enough for us to create our application; however, we are going to need more funds to maintain servers</span><span> and </span><span>for an international trademark</span><span> as </span><span>Trybo</span><span> is going global from day 1. As of right now, we have </span><span>no funds left to advertise our application. </span></p><p><span>We believe our idea is not only </span><span>changing the way people connect themselves with one another</span><span>,</span><span> like </span><span>Instagram </span><span>did,
 but we are going to work towards the betterment of the world. We 
believe people will see the value in that, and therefore we can make it 
without the large funds that some start-ups receive. We will spend $1</span><span>,</span><span>000 for the international trademark, $2</span><span>,</span><span>000 for our servers and anything on top of that will be used in advertisement to start the fire we need to spread </span><span>Trybo</span><span> throughout the world. </span></p><p><span>With all of that said, we’d like to ask you to help us inspire the world just like Victor inspired </span><span>us</span><span> to act. We are giving our blood, sweat and tears so </span><span>Trybo</span><span>
 can be a tool that gives people a unique and perhaps even an 
inspirational experience, and we believe that if you believe in what we 
believe, you could make a difference in the world by helping us do so. 
Also, please take note that we are </span><span>college
 students trying to make a difference, so we do not have much to offer 
in our rewards, but if you want to see truly the best return on 
investment (a better, more unified and inspired tomorrow), then we would
 highly appreciate your funding. Thank you for your time and 
consideration. </span></p><p></p><p><b><span>Risks and challenges</span></b></p><p><span>Currently,
 our application is in the development phase and will be coming out on 
the first of August. We are going to need crowd money for advertising 
our application. The goal of this application is to allow users to meet 
people from all over the world: so our main challenge is going to be 
getting a user database that is well spread around the world. Although, I
 feel that my partner and I are well suited to deal with that challenge 
as we are both from different continents and have lived abroad, 
attending international schools. We have our friends and family 
excited about this application.  We even have ambassadors from all over the world who are willing to help us out with marketing and spread the word. While getting a diverse user database is going to 
prove to be a challenge, it will be a challenge taken head on from the 
day one of launching the application, provided we secure the funds we need

 a social networking application that allows a user to meet new people 
from all around the world who have something in common. It uses location services and filters to put you in touch with new people from anywhere on the planet. Trybo
 will make it possible for you to explore the world, learn new 
languages, learn about new cultures, see the world through new 
perspectives, and do it all by meeting new people that have similar 
interests as you do. When opening Trybo
 for the first time, users will be prompted to sign in with Facebook 
accounts. Once signed in, the user will be prompted to give permission 
to use location services (please do keep in mind that this application 
will not work without location services). The application will take data
 such as your name, age, gender, and Facebook Page likes; However, their are some details that the user will have to fill in themselves.
The Explore Filter will be the next aspect of the application the user will set up:

In
 this tab, users will be allowed to set filters for the people they want
 to meet. For example, if a user wants to meet someone interested in 
business, economics, soccer, who resides in India and speaks English as 
well as French and Hindi, he would simply set the filters above and save
 the settings. Similar to our Explore Filters, we also have Request 
Filters, which are just slightly more basic and only involve filtering 
by the gender, age and the spoken language. These filters will control who
 you can see and who can see your profile, respectively. To expand, the 
explore function will then search for other users as per the filter 
settings and provide the user with a list of other people - on the 
Explore Page - who could potentially be added to the Tribe. If
 the user is interested in talking to the person described on the 
explore page, he can simply click the check mark on the image, or he can
 even double click on the page itself to accept. If not, the user can 
keep scrolling until he finds someone that he likes. Now, if the user 
sends a request and it gets accepted, then the user who accepted the 
request is automatically added to the “My Tribe” Page:On this page, the user can keep track of all the friends he has made using Trybo. At any point in time, they can click on any of the user profile icons and text them via wifi. Our VisionThe advent of the internet has broken down the geographical barriers of
 our planet and has revolutionized communication. We hope to take the 
communication boom one step further by creating an experience where the 
user truly gets to connect to people of different cultures and 
backgrounds. Through the aim
 of providing an immersive experience in global communities around the 
world, we hope that people will inspire each other to change the world. Our MissionWe
 believe the best way to make a change in the world is to inspire people
 around us to join us towards the same goal. Our mission is to do 
everything we can to make the biggest possible change in the world and inspire the world to do the same. Our roleDon’t get us wrong,
 our users won’t be the only ones doing something for a better tomorrow.
 While our primary role is to provide the users with the best possible 
experience, we do have another main role: to use a portion of our 
revenue to help solve the multitude of problems we are faced with today. From
 our very first profit to every following profit stream, we are always 
going to put 50% of the cash into savings so that one day, we will be 
able to open up our own development fund. This fund will use Trybo resources to help humanity in the battles against poverty, hunger, preventable diseases, illiteracy and more.
 Today, many corporations sometimes deviate from their focus of feeding 
consumers and give up some portions of their profit to aid certain 
causes or to play a role in solving certain problems. Trybo is going to be a corporation that will be dedicated to making change across our planet. Why do we need more funds?The seed money we received is just enough for us to create our application; however, we are going to need more funds to maintain servers and for an international trademark as Trybo is going global from day 1. As of right now, we have no funds left to advertise our application. We believe our idea is not only changing the way people connect themselves with one another, like Instagram did,
 but we are going to work towards the betterment of the world. We 
believe people will see the value in that, and therefore we can make it 
without the large funds that some start-ups receive. We will spend $1,000 for the international trademark, $2,000 for our servers and anything on top of that will be used in advertisement to start the fire we need to spread Trybo throughout the world. With all of that said, we’d like to ask you to help us inspire the world just like Victor inspired us to act. We are giving our blood, sweat and tears so Trybo
 can be a tool that gives people a unique and perhaps even an 
inspirational experience, and we believe that if you believe in what we 
believe, you could make a difference in the world by helping us do so. 
Also, please take note that we are college
 students trying to make a difference, so we do not have much to offer 
in our rewards, but if you want to see truly the best return on 
investment (a better, more unified and inspired tomorrow), then we would
 highly appreciate your funding. Thank you for your time and 
consideration. Risks and challengesCurrently,
 our application is in the development phase and will be coming out on 
the first of August. We are going to need crowd money for advertising 
our application. The goal of this application is to allow users to meet 
people from all over the world: so our main challenge is going to be 
getting a user database that is well spread around the world. Although, I
 feel that my partner and I are well suited to deal with that challenge 
as we are both from different continents and have lived abroad, 
attending international schools. We have our friends and family 
excited about this application.  We even have ambassadors from all over the world who are willing to help us out with marketing and spread the word. While getting a diverse user database is going to 
prove to be a challenge, it will be a challenge taken head on from the 
day one of launching the application, provided we secure the funds we need 
from Indiegogo.  Money raised will make it easier for us to overcome this challenge and turn Trybo into the next big social networking name.Other Ways in Which you can help: We have just created our Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/pages/Trybo/3813836120...): If you really like the concept of Trybo, please like our page and spread the news of Trybo through your community to help us reach our fundraising goal!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

The Impact Reaching our goal means that our entire day can be devoted to these exceptional children (ages 2 - 18).  Families will have the ability to bring their child into an environment that encourages learning and behavioral change.  Many children with ASD start out with little or no verbal behavior and learn in a very different way than typical children. Children with ASD display many challenging behaviors, but they can learn to communicate appropriately and replace these behaviors. We currently have a wonderful group of families who have put their trust in us.  It has been a real blessing to work with such devoted parents and amazing children.

and a 5-star sea kayak and white water leader - the highest level of leader
qualification – as well as being a 3-star canoeist. He has 19 years experience
of paddling on rivers and the sea all over the world and has been a leader on
several canoe expeditions such as on the Amazon in Peru in 2012.</span></p>
<p>
Having coached many people
over the years he will train local guides in how apply modern paddle skills on
the lakes and rivers of Rwanda. Combining their local knowledge with Steve's
expertise, they will learn how to lead journeys and ensure that all are run
enjoyably and safely.<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>However, Steve is also an experienced business analyst
who also holds an MBA in sustainable business. Steve therefore has not
only the practical skills to set up Kingfisher Journeys but also the business
knowledge to ensure that it succeeds.</p>
<p>He's in Rwanda with his wife for around two years whilst she delivers a project for Meteo Rwanda, the local weather forecasting and meteorological organisation. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">When this time is up, he intends to leave the company to
be run by a Rwandan management team with well‑trained local guides and leaders
in place to carry on Kingfisher Journeys vision for sea kayaking and canoeing
in their own country. </span></p>
<p><b style=""font-size: 30px; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 38px;"">All Kingfisher Journeys
needs is:</b><br/></p>
</div>
<p></p><ul><li><b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">A small injection of

income that will benefit numerous local communities.</span><br/></p><p>
</p><p>Furthermore, by enabling tourists to travel slowly,
Kingfisher Journeys will bring them – and their spending power – to new places
and to people that would otherwise have little or no opportunity to engage with
visitors to their country.</p>
<div>
<h2>We will overcome huge challenges!</h2> <p> </p>
</div>
<p>To get started, there is only a relatively small
financial commitment needed, so the most significant risk is the loss that could be incurred if we thought it too hard to try.</p>
<p>However, there are many significant risks that could
thwart this proposal. Creating any business from scratch is very hard whilst
creating a successful business in Africa is harder still. Most of these will
only become apparent once the company begins to test its ability to deliver.</p>
<p>However, the idea of sea kayaking and canoeing in
Rwanda seems to generate an infectious enthusiasm amongst almost everyone who
hears of this plan. As the suggestion is shared more widely, both supporting
and detracting advice will be taken on board and acted upon. Therefore, rather
than try to document a detailed risk analysis here, which is bound to be
incomplete, Kingfisher Journeys will set off with the idea that it will succeed
and do everything that it can to ensure that it does. It will engage with those
who share this vision. </p><div>

He's in Rwanda with his wife for around two years whilst she delivers a project for Meteo Rwanda, the local weather forecasting and meteorological organisation. When this time is up, he intends to leave the company to
be run by a Rwandan management team with well‑trained local guides and leaders
in place to carry on Kingfisher Journeys vision for sea kayaking and canoeing
in their own country. 
All Kingfisher Journeys
needs is:

A small injection of
funding - just US$10,000 (GBP £6,500) - to pay for shipping a container to
Rwanda and clearing it through customs;* and The donaton of some more
equipment so we can be truly effective from day 1.*If we raise more than our target we will buy the equipment that we need in the UK rather than relying on donations of used kit.



What will we achieve? 

Then our legacy will be that in a few years
time there could be many professional canoe and kayak guides leading journeys on the lakes and rivers of Rwanda. The fundamental purpose of Kingfisher Journeys is to
create new opportunities for local Rwandan people, many millions of whom still
live in poverty. By developing the sustainable, low impact use of Lake Kivu and
some of Rwanda’s rivers, Kingfisher Journeys will provide a new source of
income that will benefit numerous local communities.
Furthermore, by enabling tourists to travel slowly,
Kingfisher Journeys will bring them – and their spending power – to new places
and to people that would otherwise have little or no opportunity to engage with
visitors to their country.

We will overcome huge challenges!  

To get started, there is only a relatively small
financial commitment needed, so the most significant risk is the loss that could be incurred if we thought it too hard to try.
However, there are many significant risks that could
thwart this proposal. Creating any business from scratch is very hard whilst
creating a successful business in Africa is harder still. Most of these will
only become apparent once the company begins to test its ability to deliver.
However, the idea of sea kayaking and canoeing in
Rwanda seems to generate an infectious enthusiasm amongst almost everyone who
hears of this plan. As the suggestion is shared more widely, both supporting
and detracting advice will be taken on board and acted upon. Therefore, rather
than try to document a detailed risk analysis here, which is bound to be
incomplete, Kingfisher Journeys will set off with the idea that it will succeed
and do everything that it can to ensure that it does. It will engage with those
who share this vision. 

You can be part of this vision!

You can help if you are in the UK:
Please donate whatever equipment you have available. It will be going to a good home whether it is a small item like a whistle or a large one like a used sea kayak or canoe. Please see our Equipment page for a list of what we need.
You can help if you are in Rwanda:
We are seeking partners in Rwanda who can help provide logistical support, hotels from which to base our operations and investors to help develop the remarkable opportunity of kayaking and canoeing in Rwanda. If you are interested in partnering with us, please get in contact and we will arrange to come and see you.
You can help if you are anywhere in the world:
Whether you can help financially or not, please leave us a message on our Facebook page and then share this idea far and wide.
With your help can succeed and we will make a difference for the people of Rwanda!

</h3><h1><b>Company Overview</b></h1>
<p></p>Picture an online world where everyone contributes to help everyone including themselves, this is what we are creating. The first part of the platform will be designed so that individuals can request money that they need by posting an ad and asking for it. The best part about asking us for money is that users will never be asked to pay it back. (Think of this as an online lottery but instead of one person winning thousands well benefit each month) Users will pay small monthly fee (to buy their ticket so to speak) and ads will be paid out on a first come first serve basis. <br/><br/>The second part of the platform will be an online auction where users can start or run their existing business at a fraction of the cost of the leaders in the industry. The fees for this will be set up as a monthly subscription with NO final value or posting fees saving users tons of money. A percentage of the revenue raised from Auction users will also be allocated to pay to the users requesting money.<br/> <br/>The payouts will be set up on a first come first serve basis. We will payout peoples request that are in the queue based on the date it was requested. Once we have distributed all the available funds for that month the payouts will carry over until the following month until we generate more funds.<br/><p><br/></p><h3><i><b><b>Where is the money going to come
from?</b></b></i></h3><p><b>The money
that will be paid to users will come from several sources such as monthly subscriptions,
auction module revenue, advertising revenue, donations from corporations and sponsorship's,
etc. </b></p><b>
</b><p>When users
post an ad requesting money from us they will commit to a minimum monthly
donation of $5.00 which at the end of the month will be distributed to the
users. </p>
<p>We will also
be selling advertising space on our site just like every other website and once
our user base is large enough we will be generating a major portion of our
revenue from this source. In addition to these sources we will be going after
government funding and corporate sponsorship's, these funds will be pooled together
with the donations we receive to pay you the money you need.  </p>

<p>PayFon is about
ease of use. It's a modern payment method that only takes a few taps to set up
and one tap for your customers to close the deal. By using QR codes, you can
turn your mobile device  into a payment
terminal that works in tandem with any customer using the PayFon app. PayFon
can also be used for e-shop checkouts. Your customer just has to scan the QR code of the screen and it's just as easy and safe as an
in-person transaction.</p>
<p><b>What
does it mean for you?</b></p>
<p>Using PayFon to
sell is just about as easy as using it to buy. Credit card machines and cash
exchanges can be a hassle, and apps like Paypal Here and Square can be equally
frustrating for customers and vendors alike. Whether you run a small business,
an online store, or a massive corporation, PayFon will help expedite the flow
of sales and keep you ahead of the curve for the future of payment methods.</p>
<p><b> How
does it work?</b></p>
<p>Once you've
downloaded the PayFon app and signed up for your account, you'll have access to ""receive"" mode. To make a QR code for a sale, just set the transaction amount and

and customers will scan and tap to pay. The customer is charged, you receive

<br/><p>At PayFon, security is the most important piece of the puzzle. Our dedication to
your safety is apparent in our strict adherence to PCI DSS guidelines and constant
attention to evolving standards.</p>
<p><b>Maximum
Security for Users and Vendors</b></p>
<p>Your linked cards
become <i>completely</i> encrypted data as soon as they enter our systems. That
means that nobody (we mean nobody) has access to the card on your account,
technically not even yourself. This encrypted data is stored on
maximum-security, 100% PCI DSS compliant servers. </p>
<p><b>QR
Codes</b></p>
<p>Vendor QR codes
are randomly generated stamps that are used to form an encrypted “bridge” for
payments. Nothing on a QR code dictates any information about vendors' or
customers' accounts, and they cannot be used to breach any security measures.
Once paid for, the QR codes are reset each time to keep each purchase exclusive
and randomized.No
sensitive data is transferred during a transaction.</p>
<p><b>No
Swapping</b></p>
<p>Your phone acts
like a card that never leaves your sight. There is no physical exchange in a PayFon
transaction, so you can be sure that you're in control of your payment tool
each step of the way. Your vendor or seller will bring the device and code to
you, as opposed to the traditional method of taking your card or money behind
the counter or out of sight at a restaurant. No more entering card numbers and private
information and risking your security.</p>
<p><b>Account
Pass and Pin Code</b></p>
<p>Your account is
secured with a user name and password that's just as rigorously protected as
your personal information. No one will have access to your account but you, and
you can change your password at any time for any reason. You can set a PIN code
to your app so that no one besides yourself can even open your PayFon application.
When you set up your PayFon account, a one-time pass code is texted to your
device, which links your phone number to the account for an extra layer of
security.</p>
If your phone is stolen or lost, you can rest
easy. Two levels of security are used to bar third parties from entering your
app, and your account will allow you to remotely remove or reset your card as
soon as possible. </div>

<p>We are a team of PayFonApp.com, and we are passionate about creating brilliant solutions
for modern problems.</p>
<p>We've developed PayFon, in order to change the way people go about making and accepting payments.
We realized that smartphones and mobile devices were evolving quickly, and we
set our minds to work on an app that could help people with a daily issue.</p>
<p>Credit cards are inherently risky.
When you use them at a restaurant, they're taken out of view; when you use them
at online stores, you have to type down your credentials and risk your
security. Cash can easily be stolen, and poses another financial risk when you
carry it out every day. PayFon is here to change that.</p>
<p>Customers and businesses should feel
safe when a transaction is under way, and we want both sides to have an easy
way to transfer money. By using QR code technology, we've come up with a method
that only requires one tap to complete and is as secure as money transactions
could possibly be.</p>
<p>Vendors set a
price, generate a code, and their customers scan it to pay. No cards or money
change hands, eliminating any threats to a customers security. The transaction
can be completed in just a few seconds using two mobile devices. The software
is locked down and completely safe for both customer and seller, and no sensitive information
is stored on your device or transferred during the sale.</p>
<p>Our goal is for PayFon
to help people and revolutionize payment security and speed. We want push the
envelope in this modern era and make positive changes for companies and
customers everywhere.</p>
<p>We hope our
product helps us all make simpler, more comfortable payments.</p>

technology is evolving so fast that hardly anyone leaves home without a mobile
device. We carry it all the time. So why wouldn’t we use it to make and (which
is also important) accept payments.

would make cash, credit card terminals, card readers and even credit cards
unnecessary.

lightning-fast payments with no hidden fees, no extra hardware, and high

set our minds to work on an app that could help people with a daily issue.
Credit cards are inherently risky.
When you use them at a restaurant, they're taken out of view; when you use them
at online stores, you have to type down your credentials and risk your
security. Cash can easily be stolen, and poses another financial risk when you
carry it out every day. PayFon is here to change that.
Customers and businesses should feel
safe when a transaction is under way, and we want both sides to have an easy
way to transfer money. By using QR code technology, we've come up with a method
that only requires one tap to complete and is as secure as money transactions
could possibly be.
Vendors set a
price, generate a code, and their customers scan it to pay. No cards or money
change hands, eliminating any threats to a customers security. The transaction
can be completed in just a few seconds using two mobile devices. The software
is locked down and completely safe for both customer and seller, and no sensitive information
is stored on your device or transferred during the sale.
Our goal is for PayFon
to help people and revolutionize payment security and speed. We want push the
envelope in this modern era and make positive changes for companies and
customers everywhere.
We hope our
product helps us all make simpler, more comfortable payments.









We will donate every single penny we collect here to a charity within 2 years out of our future proceeds. Let's help to provide protection, health care, education and nutrition to needy children in the developing nations together. 

Remember, $50 can feed a child in Africa for a year!!!",17.0,0,"1 Campaign

His belief in the power of education motivated him to invest in the lives of Egyptian young women.  He believes that the educational
activities provided by Heya Masr will foster the growth and development of strong character for those young women of Egypt that participate in this program . Many of these girls reside in slums and do not have access to education, while many others who have dropped out of school. We believe in the potential of each and every girl and with proper support, guidance, and education, she can fully reach her potential.

The need for Heya Masr!
Why Heya Masr? The statistics for Egypt are a powerful reason,. based on 2011 UN report.
97% of women were subject to some type of sexual harassment 
Approximately 1 in 4  girls are victims of physical violence. 
Sexual abuse of children represents 18% of the total incidences related to children. 
For 53% of incidents the offender is a child's relatives, and in 45% of cases there is no family relationship. 

48.5% of women aged 25-46 years old facing the risk of developing high blood pressure.

From 2010 to 2012  more than 26,000 children dropouts from basic education. Of the 26,000,  76% of the drop outs were girls. 
2.3% of adolescent girls are married and 12% are in the process of
getting married. There was more than 40,000 cases of underage marriage, resulting in 150 thousand births from these adolescent girls.

</h3>We are not trying to tell you what your goals are or should be, and nobody else should for that matter, it is all about YOU and achieving YOUR goals to make you feel better about yourself, your life and feel inner satisfaction and fulfillment.<br/>Our slogan ""Remember Your Dreams?!"" is our way of saying please don't forget about yourself. It is both a question and a statement:  We are asking if you actually do ""remember your dreams?"", but we are also telling you to ""remember your dreams!"".<br/>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440878808/jzxrchg8ydank7fvrnmn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The font you see in the MyDagaz™ slogan is the MyDagaz™ font we created to emulate a modern day Rune inscription.<br/><br/><br/><h3>It's About ""Not Forgetting"" Your Goals and Dreams</h3>
<img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440877328/cweb549572jfcn14ts01.jpg"" hspace=""5"" src="""" style=""width: 295px; height: 224px;"" vspace=""3""/>Life is so hectic and stressful and it is so easy to put your own needs and desires on the shelf, and we want you to brush them off and keep thinking about them.<br/>Whatever your goals and dreams are, 
	MyDagaz™ is here to help and support you in your quest for a happier existence. We are not saying it will be easy or happen quickly, but with our support and encouragement (and the ever present goal reminder bracelet), it will happen!<p>We consider the MyDagaz™ Goal Reminder bracelet to be a critical part of our approach. It is a physical, ever present reminder of the goals you have set for yourself and decided you want to pursue.</p>
<p>

A good example is opening up a chocolate bar when you are on a diet - the Goal Reminder Bracelet and the Milestone Charms will certainly remind you of the wrong you are doing to yourself and ""serve up"" a good portion a guilt, hopefully enough to make you rethink the chocolate bar and find something healthier to eat. Having used the bracelet for almost a year, I can tell you that it works exactly as it was intended, which is also the feedback we have received from others as well,<br/>
<p>
<img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440878014/gmfbv0wfmljsyftybvxg.jpg"" hspace=""5"" src="""" style=""width: 282px; height: 212px;"" vspace=""3""/></p>The bracelet is very solid and at first you will notice its presence on your wrist, but like with any other jewelry you wear, your body will get used to is and stop noticing it. The milestone charms however, are designed to NOT allow you to forget their presence, yet not be intrusive or annoying to you. With their with their extremely light weight, they will feel like an ever so gentle brush against your skin, not unlike what a gentle gust of wind feels against your skin. If you shake your wrist vigorously, the charms will also make a subtle little noises when they hit the Goal Reminder Bracelet. No matter what you do though, you will barely notice the presence of all the milestone charms.<br/><br/><br/><h3>The Science Behind The Bracelets and Charms<br/>
</h3>The 
	MyDagaz™ Goal Reminder bracelet works - no question about it, but how and why? The 
bracelet does not utilize technology, electronics or magic, and neither do the milestone charms. The ""secret"" or ""science"" behind MyDagaz™ is in the totality of what we do, and only when all the elements of the bracelet, charms, the online support community and the goal tracking tools are combined, we believe success if inevitable!<br/>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440947700/a7tfrbkpb62grtwbxf6z.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The Goal Reminder Bracelet is an unobtrusive, subtle and
 perpetual reminder that will not let you forget about your goals and 
dreams.  The bracelets are made 
of high quality stainless steel and double linked to be ""tough"" 
enough to withstand constant usage and stand up to the elements. The latch is made of stainless steel with the MyDagaz™ logo, and the latch is very strong and will stand up to the ""abuse"" dished out from daily use. The design is also ""hair"" friendly and will 
not tug on any arm hair!<br/><br/>Charms are made of acrylic glass (plexiglass) and specifically 
designed to be very strong, scratch resistant, virtually fade resistant and extremely light weight,
 so you can have dozens of milestone charms on the bracelet without it 
getting heavy, annoying or cumbersome to wear. They have a spring loaded clasp that enables them to easily be attched to the bracelet. The 
extremely light weight charms gently brushes your skin and works by 
triggering a sensory perception that at times works on an unconscious 
level (meaning you are not even aware that it is happening).<br/>

<br/><h3>The Secret Behind Our Approach<br/>
</h3>
<p>
<img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440954387/kjbbcsgjmusnzl7zzz3p.jpg"" hspace=""5"" src="""" style="""" vspace=""3""/></p>The MyDagaz main mission is to support our members in reaching their goals and dreams in life, and we do this by providing online tools, a superior support community and by wearing our Goal Reminder Bracelet and Milestone Charms. The online support community is there to help and encourage our members during trying times and when life slumps or hits a low. We feel it is critical to have someone to talk to when this happens because we all know life always has some surprises in store for us. Although the online support is important, we firmly believe the most critical piece in achieving success is using the Goal Reminder Bracelet, as it is always with you as a constant reminder.<br/><br/>We have described the 
shape and designs for the Goal Reminder Bracelet and the Milestone 
Charms, but it is only when we combine these physical objects with our 
unique and patent pending methodology, that success is the likely outcome. 
Unlike the typical approach where you receive a reward when you reach a 
milestone, our approach is completely opposite and provides 
significantly more motivation and inspiration.<br/><p></p>
<p align=""center"">
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441065444/v5jywbi5hwpf5p0brmat.jpg"" hspace=""5"" src="""" style="""" vspace=""3""/></p>The MyDagaz™ approach using the bracelet and the milestone charms, is to place all the charms on the
 bracelet when you start pursuing a goal or a dream, and then remove 
charms as you reach the various milestones. This might seem trivial at first glance, 
but the benefits of this method are significant and multiple:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>
<b>Psychological</b>: The simple fact that all milestone charms are 
present from the very beginning, is a strong motivational factor because
 you can see all the steps that are needed to accomplish to reach your 
goal. The presence of all the charms and the desire to remove or reduce 
the number of charms (which subconsciously represents ""road blocks"" 
between you and your goal/happiness), provides a much stronger desire to
 win or accomplish this task than the opposite method of motivating 
yourself to ""win"" or accomplish the reward of receiving another charm.</li>
<li>
<b>Physical</b>: With all the charms on the bracelet at the beginning of
 the pursuit of a dream or goal, the larger number of charms provide a 
stronger physical reminder with the gentle brushes of multiple milestone
 charms touching your skin. The sensation they create is still extremely
 subtle, but more noticeable which is extremely beneficial when starting
 pursuing a brand new goal.</li>
<li>
<b>Visual</b>: With all the charms in place at the beginning of a goal 
pursuit, there is an undeniable visual effect from the colorful charms 
on your wrist. Again, it is almost impossible to ignore this strong, but
 unobtrusive reminder of your own promise to yourself.</li>
</ul>
This approach, combined with the use of our specially designed bracelets and charms, delivers a significantly stronger motivation as all the milestones you 
need to accomplish as always visible, <br/><br/><br/><h3>Avoid Regrets, Achieve Goals, Enjoy Happiness</h3>
MyDagaz™ is all about helping you focus and achieve on your dreams and life goals at this moment in time, but we also want you to avoid regrets later in life. People in their 
twilight years often reflect on their lives and the regrets they have, and we want to help you 
avoid these regrets by being conscious about the things you want to 
change or improve on, and actively work on making those changes.<br/><br/><i>
<img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441068467/chw4veqghnogopnht3ue.png"" hspace=""5"" src="""" style="""" vspace=""3""/>On a personal note and while working on this particular segment, I could not help myself and I asked my 78 year old mom if she had any regrets in life, and asked her to be as honest as possible. She answered ""my biggest regret is not being able to spend more time with you and your kids"". It is very hard for me not to tear up when I think about this, but the feeling is so mutual mom and its not too late!  One of my top goals in life is to spend more time with my mom and brother that live on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.</i><p>Nobody wants to live with regrets, but I dare say we all have them and MyDagaz wants to help you focus on your goals to avoid this! Believe it or not, the list of regrets below is just a small sample of the ones listed on numerous sites, and the ones below are listed in no particular order:<br/>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Been happier more. Not taken life so seriously</li>
<li>Wish I had lived my own life rather than how society taught me to live.</li>
<li>Gone on more trips with the family/friends</li>
<li>Not visiting a dying friend before he died</li>
<li>Wish I discovered my purpose earlier</li>
<li>Taught my kids to do stuff more</li>
<li>I wish I had taken more risks</li>
<li>Not asking that girl/boy out</li>
<li>Wish I had taken better care of myself</li>
<li>Not getting that degree (high school or college)</li>
<li>Wish I’d allowed myself to love</li>
<li>Spending more time with the kids/family</li>
<li>Wish I had touched more lives and inspired more people</li>
<li>Working so much at the expense of family and friendships</li>
<li>Standing up to bullies in school and in life</li>
<li>Stayed in touch with good friends from my childhood and youth</li>
<li>Turned off my phone more/Left my phone at home</li>
<li>Worrying about what others thought about me so much</li>
<li>Not having enough confidence in myself</li>
</ul>
<img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441067051/obslokutlmwdebyruw8s.jpg"" hspace=""5"" src="""" style="""" vspace=""3""/>There is NO reason for you to have regrets later in life! Even if you don't succeed 100% of the time,  you have to keep trying and do the best you can, and MyDagaz is the solution you are seeking. At the very core of our belief, we know that if you can 
accomplish your goals and dreams, you will become a happier individual, 
feel better about yourself and more satisfied with your life. 
Ultimately, this helps you achieve a greater ""inner peace"" and will 
positively impact your health and outlook on life.<br/><br/><br/><h3>A Happy Person = Endless Life and Health Benefits!</h3>
<p>
</p>MyDagaz wants you to focus more on yourself and your dreams and goals, because we believe that will make you a happier and a more self fulfilled person. Besides, who
 doesn't want to be happy?! Being happy not only makes you feel good and
 positively affects your interaction with the surroundings, it has a 
profound impact on your productivity, health and well-being too.<br/><br/><h4>Brain Health</h4>
<img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440644098/lqiczumglywjosizxaac.jpg"" hspace=""5"" src="""" style="""" vspace=""3""/>Numerous studies show that happiness has a significant and lasting impact on your health, and it directly affects your brain: Negative mood variance disturbs your interaction with your environment,
 affecting your ability to perceive, remember, and reinforce existing or
 create new neural connections, while being happy improves your ability 
to be more cognitively alert and productive. Other than being much more 
fun to be around, being happy:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>stimulates the growth of nerve connections.</li>
<li>improves cognition by increasing mental productivity.</li>
<li>improves your ability to analyze and think.</li>
<li>affects your view of surroundings.</li>
<li>increases attentiveness.</li>
<li>leads to more happy thoughts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy people are more creative, solve problems faster, and tend to be more mentally alert. [Source: Psychology Today]<br/></p>
<h4>
Longer Life</h4>Being
 happy doesn't just improve the quality of your life. According to a new
 study, it may increase the quantity of your life as well. Older
 people were up to 35% less likely to die during the five-year study if 
they reported feeling happy, excited, and content on a typical day. And 
this was true even though the researchers took factors such as chronic 
health problems, depression, and financial security out of the equation. <p>

 had expected that we might see a link between how happy people felt 
over the day and their future mortality, but we were struck by how 
strong the effect was,"" says Andrew Steptoe, Ph.D., the lead author of 
the study and a professor of psychology at University College London, in
 the United Kingdom.<br/>[Source: Health Magazine 2015]<br/><br/>People who consider themselves happy, have:<br/><ul>
<li>a lower heart rate</li>
<li>Lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol</li>
<li>Lower concentrations of a plasma associated with heart disease</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>According to an analysis of 30 studies, happy people are less likely to get sick</li>
<li>When exposed to the virus that causes colds and flu, people with a more positive outlook not only get sick less often, but recover faster.</li>
<li>In a study of stressed-out law students, optimistic people had more immune-boosting blood cells than their pessimistic peers.</li>
<li>People who are happy because they feel their lives have meaning and purpose (helping others for example), experience healthy changes at the cellular level.</li>
<li>Among older people, optimists have a 77% lower risk of heart disease than do pessimists. Researchers believe this is because optimists are better able to negotiate life's stressors without becoming irritated.</li>
<li>An analysis of 30 studies found that happiness adds several years to a person's life. The actual number of years could be as much as 7 1/2 years.<br/>[Source: happify.com]<br/>

<h4>Stress Reducer</h4>
<p>Feedback from people using the bracelet have said it absolutely works 
as intended and more or less becomes a part of you. No matter how stressed you 
get, it doesn't let you forget about the promises you made to yourself. 
Several people have reported that being reminded of, and focusing on 
their goals and dreams had a calming effect at times of high stress 
situations.<br/></p>

<br/><br/><h3>Who We are and Why We Made It</h3>
<p>
<img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440955197/qdgzpe1y6gzx03mfijjy.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 306px; height: 186px;""/></p>The idea behind 
	MyDagaz™ was born an evening in 2013 when my wife and I were talking about how hard it is to stay focused on a goal when ""life happens"". Being parents, working and always stressed, tired and exhausted, you always took care of everything else first and when it came time to think about what would make yourself happy (besides instant gratification through food and snacks), we were ""zombies in front of the TV or asleep"". ""In the day to day life there was no time to think about yourself and your needs"". This didn't happen overnight and was a gradual process over many years. If only there was a way to be reminded of what is important to you so you can work towards your dreams and goals and make them happen - even if it takes time. In a nutshell, this is how the seed to MyDagaz™ was born.<br/><br/>The Founder of MyDagaz™ is Rolf Heitmann, a seasoned entrepreneur and IT executive with a broad technology background as well. Rolf lives in Rhode Island USA, but has roots in and grew up in 
Norway where he became familiar with the ancient Viking runes, and this is how 
MyDagaz™ received its name. Rolf is a very enthusiastic driving force and believes in MyDagaz™ and its mission to help people become happier and live a more fulfilled life, He has personally executed, managed or overseen every aspect of the creation of MyDagaz™ and its services and offerings.<br/><br/><p>
<img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440618998/u32ooxdlo2304yudkqtr.jpg"" hspace=""5"" src="""" style=""width: 143px; height: 159px;"" vspace=""3""/>The Dagaz rune is a very ""positively charged"" symbol and 
	MyDagaz™™ is a modern take on ancient beliefs transforming dreams and goals to realize a positive outcome, happiness in life and inner balance. For thousands of years, it was strongly believed that the Dagaz symbol brings a positive outcome to any situation that is of concern.<br/><br/><br/></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>We have invested substantial time, money and efforts in the last years to research, design and develop the 
	MyDagaz™ concept. We worked with industrial designers and engineers, graphic designers, user interface designers and the best creative minds to come up with a solution that we believe will serve our customers extremely well. We have completed a full manufacturing cycle and and have produced approximately 30 different charms in very small quantities in the weight loss category (maroon colored charms) and basic starter charms like the Start Charm, Half Way Charm and the Goal Reached Charm in most categories.<br/><br/>The charms are made in the USA, and we have already started working on improving manufacturing processes to enable larger scale production. Due to the large number of unique charms, we can not mass 
produce the charms, and in order to minimize cost and maximize flexibility in creating custom charms (and on short notice), all charms are made in-house.<br/><br/><p>We are ready to start manufacturing the thousands of different charms needed to help people with their goals, and for this we need your help in raising the needed funds for the following tasks:<br/>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Acquire 8 water-cooled, three-axis CNC machines capable of performing high-speed micro engraving/cutting operations. A CNC controller and a desktop PC with milling software is needed for each CNC machine. Estimated cost is US $4,500 each with a total cost of US $36,000.</li>
</ul>

</p>
<ul>
<li>Acquire charm raw material sheets in eleven different colors, lobster clasps, jumper rings and protective films for the charm front and back surfaces, Estimated total cost is US $14,000.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Acquire miscellaneous equipment to support the manufacturing process: engraving/cutting tool bits for the CNC machines, vacuum pumps for vacuum tables, water pumps, spindle vacuum systems for engraving debris collection. Estimated total cost is US $9,000<br/>
</li>
</ul>We are really excited about the deals and perks we can offer you in return for supporting us! We are offering discounts on memberships, bracelets, charms, and various package offerings containing all of these items. The crown jewel in our collection of perks is the <b>LIFETIME membership</b> option we are exclusively offering during this crowdfunding campaign and is never again to be offered.<br/><br/>Should we not be able to raise the entire amount we are seeking, we will need to scale back accordingly and. The critical task right now is to create as many charms as we can to help as many  people as possible with their goals and dreams. On the other hand, should we raise more funds than we are asking for, it will be used to secure a suitable location for manufacturing and warehouse for the products.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Frequently Asked Questions<br/>
</h3>
<h4>What is MyDagaz™?</h4>
MyDagaz™ is a family owned company and the world's first to offer motivational bracelets and charms designed specifically to help you reach your goals - whatever they are! MyDagaz™ is membership based and relies on memberships to fund staff, technology and support growth. 
	MyDagaz™ consists of two main elements;
	<ul>
<li>The Online Support Community and a set of tools to help you track 
		and manage the goals and dreams you have decided you want to focus on. 
		The Online Support Community consists of MyDagaz™ staff and all the 
		other MyDagaz™ members, and the sole purpose of the community is to 
		offer support and encouragement to each other when life becomes 
		challenging it is becomes difficult focusing on their goals and dreams.</li>

		the bracelet's main function is to keep reminding you of the promises 
		you made to yourself, i.e. the goals and dreams you decided to pursue. 
		Members should wear the bracelet with the milestone charms so they at a 
		glance can see where they stand and how far they have to go before

</ul>
<p>The membership fees are purposefully kept extremely low and will be kept 
	that way as we do not want this to be a financial burden. Unfortunately, 
	many people cannot afford even a low membership fee, and we do offer 
	assistance to low income families.<br/><br/>
</p>
<h4>How does it work?</h4>
<p>There are many ways to use the charms and we do not want to discourage anyone from being creative. There are some proven ways to doing it and we will outline those here as well as discuss different ways of using them in our Blog.</p>
<p>The bracelet is made of stainless steel and will survive most environments as it is intended to be worn 24/7. You might find it difficult to sleep with the bracelet on or prefer taking it off when showering, and of course you should take it off when you want to. It is important though to keep it on as much as possible as it is your constant reminder of the goals you have set for yourself.</p>
<p>Recommended use of the charms is to attach all milestone charms for a particular goal and then remove charms as you reach milestones. We designed the bracelet and the charms to work together to keep reminding you of your dreams and goals without being overbearing or annoying. The charms are made of acrylic glass which is very strong, yet extremely light weight and adding dozens of charms will barely impact the weight. We believe placing all the charms when you start pursuing a dream or goal is the most inspirational, not only because you clearly can see all the milestones you need to accomplish before you reach your goal, but all the charms provide a stronger, yet extremely gentle, soft and soothing touch to the skin to make sure you do not forget what is important to you.</p>

<h4>Why is it important to pursue goals and dreams?</h4>
Being
 happy doesn't just improve the quality of your life. According to a new
 study, it may increase the quantity of your life as well. Older
 people were up to 35% less likely to die during the five-year study if 
they reported feeling happy, excited, and content on a typical day. And 
this was true even though the researchers took factors such as chronic 
health problems, depression, and financial security out of the equation.<br/><br/>In other words, it is not only important to achieve your goals and dreams to feel better about yourself, achieve life fulfillment, inner peace and satisfaction, it has a direct impact on your health and you will live longer!<br/><br/>
<h4>Ok - life is ""getting in the way"", what now?</h4>
When life ""gets in your way"" or difficulties in life are mounting, thinking about your own needs, desires or dreams are typically the last thing on your mind. It is unfortunate, but the reality that you set aside yourself and forget your own dreams when ""life happens"". The bracelet is there to remind you of your goals, and we have been told that thinking about your goals and dreams has a calming effect during stressful situations. The bracelet should help you keep your happy thoughts close by at all times, but we also want you to use the online community as a resource for communicating with others potentially having gone though what you are experiencing, listen and maybe personal advice to help work through difficult life situations.<br/><br/><h4>What is the MyDagaz™ bracelet and charms made of?</h4>
<p>The bracelet is made of stainless steel and will survive most environments as it is intended to be worn 24/7. You might find it difficult to sleep with the bracelet on or prefer taking it off when showering, and of course you should take it off when you want to. It is important though to keep it on as much as possible as it is your constant reminder of the goals you have set for yourself.</p>
<p>Recommended use of the charms is to attach all milestone charms for a particular goal and then remove charms as you reach milestones. We designed the bracelet and the charms to work together to keep reminding you of your dreams and goals without being overbearing or annoying. The charms are made of acrylic glass which is very strong, yet extremely light weight and adding dozens of charms will barely impact the weight. We believe placing all the charms when you start pursuing a dream or goal is the most inspirational, not only because you clearly can see all the milestones you need to accomplish before you reach your goal, but all the charms provide a stronger, yet extremely gentle, soft and soothing touch to the skin to make sure you do not forget what is important to you.<br/></p>
<h4>What is the size of the MyDagaz™ bracelet?</h4>
We currently have two bracelets: one is a men's bracelet, which is wider and thicker than the feminine women's bracelet. The bracelets will be stocked in the following sizes:<br/>Women's bracelet lengths:<br/>5"",    5 1/2"",    6"",    6 1/2"",    7"",    7 1/2"",    8"",    8 1/2"",     9""    and    9 1/2""<br/><br/>Men's bracelet lengths: <br/>6"",    6 1/2"",    7"",    7 1/2"",    8"",    8 1/2"",     9"",    9 1/2"",    10""    and    10 1/2""<br/><br/>
<h4>Who are you?</h4>
The Co-Founders of MyDagaz™ are Kelly and Rolf Heitmann, both seasoned IT executives with Rolf having a broad technology background as well. Rolf, having roots in and growing up in Norway, was familiar with the ancient Viking runes, that is how MyDagaz™ received its name.<br/><br/>
<h4>Risks &amp; Challenges</h4>Since we have already completed a full production cycle of the weight loss charms and have learned the hard way what pitfalls there are, we are confident that moving into a larger scale production environment will be a smooth one. We are also very aware that with a larger scale production, we still have to be diligent with quality control to ensure the highest quality products. We have also minimized the risk of running out of materials by identifying multiple vendors that can deliver the necessary materials we need, and as we ramp up production we will also make sure we have necessary spare parts to minimize downtime during production.<br/><br/><h4>Other Ways You Can Help</h4>Of course backing our project by selecting one of the perks we offer is a very effective way to support our project and we are very grateful for that. We do understand however that backing is not always an option for everyone and we appreciate any other help one would be generously willing to offer.<br/>Our main challenge is spreading the word and here are a few effective ways to support this effort: <br/><br/><ul>
<li>Share the MyDagaz™ images or link on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Instagram, tumblr or any other social network you subscribe to</li>
<li>Forward the link and the information by email to your friends and acquaintance and ask them to do the same</li>
<li>Tell us about blogs or other media channels that could be interested in writing or talking about the MyDagaz™. We will be happy to reach out and provide them with everything they need to spread the word.</li>

MyDagaz™ Intro
The ultimate goal of MyDagaz™ is to assist and support you achieve happiness, and we firmly believe this will happen by achieving YOUR dreams and goals in life. We want to help, support and encourage you to make this happen, and below you can find you how we will do this, and why it is so important!""Remember Your Dreams?!"" - MyDagaz™ Slogan
We are not trying to tell you what your goals are or should be, and nobody else should for that matter, it is all about YOU and achieving YOUR goals to make you feel better about yourself, your life and feel inner satisfaction and fulfillment.Our slogan ""Remember Your Dreams?!"" is our way of saying please don't forget about yourself. It is both a question and a statement:  We are asking if you actually do ""remember your dreams?"", but we are also telling you to ""remember your dreams!"".
The font you see in the MyDagaz™ slogan is the MyDagaz™ font we created to emulate a modern day Rune inscription.It's About ""Not Forgetting"" Your Goals and Dreams
Life is so hectic and stressful and it is so easy to put your own needs and desires on the shelf, and we want you to brush them off and keep thinking about them.Whatever your goals and dreams are, 
	MyDagaz™ is here to help and support you in your quest for a happier existence. We are not saying it will be easy or happen quickly, but with our support and encouragement (and the ever present goal reminder bracelet), it will happen!We consider the MyDagaz™ Goal Reminder bracelet to be a critical part of our approach. It is a physical, ever present reminder of the goals you have set for yourself and decided you want to pursue.



With the Goal Reminder Bracelet on your wrist, it will always let you know when you are doing something contrary to the goals you have set for yourself. A good example is opening up a chocolate bar when you are on a diet - the Goal Reminder Bracelet and the Milestone Charms will certainly remind you of the wrong you are doing to yourself and ""serve up"" a good portion a guilt, hopefully enough to make you rethink the chocolate bar and find something healthier to eat. Having used the bracelet for almost a year, I can tell you that it works exactly as it was intended, which is also the feedback we have received from others as well,

The bracelet is very solid and at first you will notice its presence on your wrist, but like with any other jewelry you wear, your body will get used to is and stop noticing it. The milestone charms however, are designed to NOT allow you to forget their presence, yet not be intrusive or annoying to you. With their with their extremely light weight, they will feel like an ever so gentle brush against your skin, not unlike what a gentle gust of wind feels against your skin. If you shake your wrist vigorously, the charms will also make a subtle little noises when they hit the Goal Reminder Bracelet. No matter what you do though, you will barely notice the presence of all the milestone charms.The Science Behind The Bracelets and Charms
The 
	MyDagaz™ Goal Reminder bracelet works - no question about it, but how and why? The 
bracelet does not utilize technology, electronics or magic, and neither do the milestone charms. The ""secret"" or ""science"" behind MyDagaz™ is in the totality of what we do, and only when all the elements of the bracelet, charms, the online support community and the goal tracking tools are combined, we believe success if inevitable!
The Goal Reminder Bracelet is an unobtrusive, subtle and
 perpetual reminder that will not let you forget about your goals and 
dreams.  The bracelets are made 
of high quality stainless steel and double linked to be ""tough"" 
enough to withstand constant usage and stand up to the elements. The latch is made of stainless steel with the MyDagaz™ logo, and the latch is very strong and will stand up to the ""abuse"" dished out from daily use. The design is also ""hair"" friendly and will 
not tug on any arm hair!Charms are made of acrylic glass (plexiglass) and specifically 
designed to be very strong, scratch resistant, virtually fade resistant and extremely light weight,
 so you can have dozens of milestone charms on the bracelet without it 
getting heavy, annoying or cumbersome to wear. They have a spring loaded clasp that enables them to easily be attched to the bracelet. The 
extremely light weight charms gently brushes your skin and works by 
triggering a sensory perception that at times works on an unconscious 
level (meaning you are not even aware that it is happening).

	It is our goal to support and help anyone's dreams 
	or goals with our charms, whatever they might be. There will be thousands of charms available in the various milestone categories we have identified so far:

Weight Loss milestone charms category

Cessation milestone charms category

	Medical & Health milestone charms category

	Travel milestone charms category

	Bucket List milestone charms category

	Sports milestone charms category

	Financial milestone charms category

	Anniversaries milestone charms category

	Spiritual & Religious milestone charms category

	Education milestone charms category

	Custom milestone charms category

The Secret Behind Our Approach


The MyDagaz main mission is to support our members in reaching their goals and dreams in life, and we do this by providing online tools, a superior support community and by wearing our Goal Reminder Bracelet and Milestone Charms. The online support community is there to help and encourage our members during trying times and when life slumps or hits a low. We feel it is critical to have someone to talk to when this happens because we all know life always has some surprises in store for us. Although the online support is important, we firmly believe the most critical piece in achieving success is using the Goal Reminder Bracelet, as it is always with you as a constant reminder.We have described the 
shape and designs for the Goal Reminder Bracelet and the Milestone 
Charms, but it is only when we combine these physical objects with our 
unique and patent pending methodology, that success is the likely outcome. 
Unlike the typical approach where you receive a reward when you reach a 
milestone, our approach is completely opposite and provides 
significantly more motivation and inspiration.

The MyDagaz™ approach using the bracelet and the milestone charms, is to place all the charms on the
 bracelet when you start pursuing a goal or a dream, and then remove 
charms as you reach the various milestones. This might seem trivial at first glance, 
but the benefits of this method are significant and multiple:

Psychological: The simple fact that all milestone charms are 
present from the very beginning, is a strong motivational factor because
 you can see all the steps that are needed to accomplish to reach your 
goal. The presence of all the charms and the desire to remove or reduce 
the number of charms (which subconsciously represents ""road blocks"" 
between you and your goal/happiness), provides a much stronger desire to
 win or accomplish this task than the opposite method of motivating 
yourself to ""win"" or accomplish the reward of receiving another charm.

Physical: With all the charms on the bracelet at the beginning of
 the pursuit of a dream or goal, the larger number of charms provide a 
stronger physical reminder with the gentle brushes of multiple milestone
 charms touching your skin. The sensation they create is still extremely
 subtle, but more noticeable which is extremely beneficial when starting
 pursuing a brand new goal.

Visual: With all the charms in place at the beginning of a goal 
pursuit, there is an undeniable visual effect from the colorful charms 
on your wrist. Again, it is almost impossible to ignore this strong, but
 unobtrusive reminder of your own promise to yourself.

This approach, combined with the use of our specially designed bracelets and charms, delivers a significantly stronger motivation as all the milestones you 
need to accomplish as always visible, Avoid Regrets, Achieve Goals, Enjoy Happiness
MyDagaz™ is all about helping you focus and achieve on your dreams and life goals at this moment in time, but we also want you to avoid regrets later in life. People in their 
twilight years often reflect on their lives and the regrets they have, and we want to help you 
avoid these regrets by being conscious about the things you want to 
change or improve on, and actively work on making those changes.
On a personal note and while working on this particular segment, I could not help myself and I asked my 78 year old mom if she had any regrets in life, and asked her to be as honest as possible. She answered ""my biggest regret is not being able to spend more time with you and your kids"". It is very hard for me not to tear up when I think about this, but the feeling is so mutual mom and its not too late!  One of my top goals in life is to spend more time with my mom and brother that live on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.Nobody wants to live with regrets, but I dare say we all have them and MyDagaz wants to help you focus on your goals to avoid this! Believe it or not, the list of regrets below is just a small sample of the ones listed on numerous sites, and the ones below are listed in no particular order:


Been happier more. Not taken life so seriously
Wish I had lived my own life rather than how society taught me to live.
Gone on more trips with the family/friends
Not visiting a dying friend before he died
Wish I discovered my purpose earlier
Taught my kids to do stuff more
I wish I had taken more risks
Not asking that girl/boy out
Wish I had taken better care of myself
Not getting that degree (high school or college)
Wish I’d allowed myself to love
Spending more time with the kids/family
Wish I had touched more lives and inspired more people
Working so much at the expense of family and friendships
Standing up to bullies in school and in life
Stayed in touch with good friends from my childhood and youth
Turned off my phone more/Left my phone at home
Worrying about what others thought about me so much
Not having enough confidence in myself

There is NO reason for you to have regrets later in life! Even if you don't succeed 100% of the time,  you have to keep trying and do the best you can, and MyDagaz is the solution you are seeking. At the very core of our belief, we know that if you can 
accomplish your goals and dreams, you will become a happier individual, 
feel better about yourself and more satisfied with your life. 
Ultimately, this helps you achieve a greater ""inner peace"" and will 
positively impact your health and outlook on life.A Happy Person = Endless Life and Health Benefits!

MyDagaz wants you to focus more on yourself and your dreams and goals, because we believe that will make you a happier and a more self fulfilled person. Besides, who
 doesn't want to be happy?! Being happy not only makes you feel good and
 positively affects your interaction with the surroundings, it has a 
profound impact on your productivity, health and well-being too.Brain Health
Numerous studies show that happiness has a significant and lasting impact on your health, and it directly affects your brain: Negative mood variance disturbs your interaction with your environment,
 affecting your ability to perceive, remember, and reinforce existing or
 create new neural connections, while being happy improves your ability 
to be more cognitively alert and productive. Other than being much more 
fun to be around, being happy:
stimulates the growth of nerve connections.
improves cognition by increasing mental productivity.
improves your ability to analyze and think.
affects your view of surroundings.
increases attentiveness.
leads to more happy thoughts.

Happy people are more creative, solve problems faster, and tend to be more mentally alert. [Source: Psychology Today]

Longer LifeBeing
 happy doesn't just improve the quality of your life. According to a new
 study, it may increase the quantity of your life as well. Older
 people were up to 35% less likely to die during the five-year study if 
they reported feeling happy, excited, and content on a typical day. And 
this was true even though the researchers took factors such as chronic 
health problems, depression, and financial security out of the equation. 
""We
 had expected that we might see a link between how happy people felt 
over the day and their future mortality, but we were struck by how 
strong the effect was,"" says Andrew Steptoe, Ph.D., the lead author of 
the study and a professor of psychology at University College London, in
 the United Kingdom.[Source: Health Magazine 2015]People who consider themselves happy, have:
a lower heart rate
Lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol
Lower concentrations of a plasma associated with heart disease


According to an analysis of 30 studies, happy people are less likely to get sick
When exposed to the virus that causes colds and flu, people with a more positive outlook not only get sick less often, but recover faster.
In a study of stressed-out law students, optimistic people had more immune-boosting blood cells than their pessimistic peers.
People who are happy because they feel their lives have meaning and purpose (helping others for example), experience healthy changes at the cellular level.
Among older people, optimists have a 77% lower risk of heart disease than do pessimists. Researchers believe this is because optimists are better able to negotiate life's stressors without becoming irritated.
An analysis of 30 studies found that happiness adds several years to a person's life. The actual number of years could be as much as 7 1/2 years.[Source: happify.com]


Stress Reducer
Feedback from people using the bracelet have said it absolutely works 
as intended and more or less becomes a part of you. No matter how stressed you 
get, it doesn't let you forget about the promises you made to yourself. 
Several people have reported that being reminded of, and focusing on 
their goals and dreams had a calming effect at times of high stress 
situations.

Who We are and Why We Made It

The idea behind 
	MyDagaz™ was born an evening in 2013 when my wife and I were talking about how hard it is to stay focused on a goal when ""life happens"". Being parents, working and always stressed, tired and exhausted, you always took care of everything else first and when it came time to think about what would make yourself happy (besides instant gratification through food and snacks), we were ""zombies in front of the TV or asleep"". ""In the day to day life there was no time to think about yourself and your needs"". This didn't happen overnight and was a gradual process over many years. If only there was a way to be reminded of what is important to you so you can work towards your dreams and goals and make them happen - even if it takes time. In a nutshell, this is how the seed to MyDagaz™ was born.The Founder of MyDagaz™ is Rolf Heitmann, a seasoned entrepreneur and IT executive with a broad technology background as well. Rolf lives in Rhode Island USA, but has roots in and grew up in 
Norway where he became familiar with the ancient Viking runes, and this is how 
MyDagaz™ received its name. Rolf is a very enthusiastic driving force and believes in MyDagaz™ and its mission to help people become happier and live a more fulfilled life, He has personally executed, managed or overseen every aspect of the creation of MyDagaz™ and its services and offerings.
The Dagaz rune is a very ""positively charged"" symbol and 
	MyDagaz™™ is a modern take on ancient beliefs transforming dreams and goals to realize a positive outcome, happiness in life and inner balance. For thousands of years, it was strongly believed that the Dagaz symbol brings a positive outcome to any situation that is of concern.
What We Need & What You GetWe have invested substantial time, money and efforts in the last years to research, design and develop the 
	MyDagaz™ concept. We worked with industrial designers and engineers, graphic designers, user interface designers and the best creative minds to come up with a solution that we believe will serve our customers extremely well. We have completed a full manufacturing cycle and and have produced approximately 30 different charms in very small quantities in the weight loss category (maroon colored charms) and basic starter charms like the Start Charm, Half Way Charm and the Goal Reached Charm in most categories.The charms are made in the USA, and we have already started working on improving manufacturing processes to enable larger scale production. Due to the large number of unique charms, we can not mass 
produce the charms, and in order to minimize cost and maximize flexibility in creating custom charms (and on short notice), all charms are made in-house.We are ready to start manufacturing the thousands of different charms needed to help people with their goals, and for this we need your help in raising the needed funds for the following tasks:


Acquire 8 water-cooled, three-axis CNC machines capable of performing high-speed micro engraving/cutting operations. A CNC controller and a desktop PC with milling software is needed for each CNC machine. Estimated cost is US $4,500 each with a total cost of US $36,000.





Acquire charm raw material sheets in eleven different colors, lobster clasps, jumper rings and protective films for the charm front and back surfaces, Estimated total cost is US $14,000.

Acquire miscellaneous equipment to support the manufacturing process: engraving/cutting tool bits for the CNC machines, vacuum pumps for vacuum tables, water pumps, spindle vacuum systems for engraving debris collection. Estimated total cost is US $9,000

We are really excited about the deals and perks we can offer you in return for supporting us! We are offering discounts on memberships, bracelets, charms, and various package offerings containing all of these items. The crown jewel in our collection of perks is the LIFETIME membership option we are exclusively offering during this crowdfunding campaign and is never again to be offered.Should we not be able to raise the entire amount we are seeking, we will need to scale back accordingly and. The critical task right now is to create as many charms as we can to help as many  people as possible with their goals and dreams. On the other hand, should we raise more funds than we are asking for, it will be used to secure a suitable location for manufacturing and warehouse for the products.Frequently Asked Questions

<b>Martin Albert </b>(<a href=""http://www.bitalo.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bitalo.com</a>): <div>Martin is a full-time Bitcoin enthusiast from the very beginning of the cryptocurrency era. As a voluntarist, he thinks that statism is a crime and thinks about how to make the Bitcoin world a better place. For him, the most exiting thing is its political aspect - you and only you control your wealth. Having lost quite some Bitcoins in the past, Martin understood that centralized exchanges are in no way different than normal banks, where you give up control over your money. This inspires him to create a service for the Bitcoin world where the Bitcoins are always safe and in control of the users.<br/>

Our schedule of events, available for viewing at <a href=""http://www.bookpeopleofmoscow.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.bookpeopleofmoscow.com</a>, is accordingly pretty busy. In just the past 3 and 1/2 years since the Spurlings and the Werners bought and revitalized the store, we've enjoyed meeting at least two Pulitzer winners and dozens of award-winning authors. But perhaps you've noticed that  1) sometimes it is hard to hear even with a microphone and amplifier, and 2) the chairs we have for our in-store events are large, heavy, difficult to move, and take up a lot of space?<br/></p> <ul> <li>BookPeople of Moscow wants to keep hosting lots of events, because the feedback from the wide range of people who attend is consistently enthusiastic and positive. Although author events rarely turn a profit, we love contributing to the cultural and artistic life of our vibrant community.<br/>
</li> <li>A better sound system and chairs will make it much easier for BookPeople staff to set up for events and for the attendees to enjoy them.<br/>
</li> <li>The cost of a better sound system and new chairs is beyond our budget; the day to day sales at the store simply don't allow us to set aside any money for anything after expenses for payroll, occupancy costs, and the store stock. <br/>
</li> </ul> <p>Your contribution will help BookPeople of Moscow meet community needs and help keep BookPeople vibrant and solvent.<br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul> <li>We have been planning on replacing our chairs at some point and have finally located the perfect solution. (Thanks to Village Books in Bellingham!) The chairs are comfortable, lightweight, durable, easy to store, easy to set up and take down, and will make it possible for us and our volunteers to set up for events without worrying about tweaking our backs or breaking a sweat in our dressy event clothes. The chairs will also allow us to fit a few more people into our event space since they have a narrower profile than our current chairs, which were purchased from UI surplus and meant for permanent, heavy-duty classroom use. Each new chair costs $23 and there are no shipping costs. We'd love to get at least 50 (cost of $1150) and will get up to 100  ($2300) if funds allow.<br/>
</li> <li>A new and better sound system can be purchased for $2500. We are in the process of seeking out the best system for our needs.<br/>
</li> <li>If we don't meet our goal we will buy as many chairs as we can, and if possible, we will buy a portion of the sound system that we need, and try again for the rest of the system at a later date.<br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>What price inspiration and enlightenment?</h3>
<p>We are going to quote our hero Azar Nafisi (author of Reading Lolita in Tehran) in her newest book, The Republic of Imagination, explaining why reading and bookstores are essential:</p>
<p>""Imaginative knowledge is pragmatic: it helps shape our attitude to the world and our place in it and influences our capacity to make decisions. Politicians, educators, businessmen -- we are all affected by this vision or its lack. If it is true that in a democracy, imagination and ideas are secondary, a sort of luxury, then what is the purpose of life in such a society? What will make its citizens loyal or concerned about their country's well-being, and not just their own selfish pursuits? I would argue that imaginative knowledge is, in a very practical sense, indispensable to the formation of a democratic society, its vision of itself and its future, playing an important role in the preservation of the democratic ideal.""<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Why We Need Your Financial Contribution<br/>
</h3> <p> Books are not like other products or widgets or food, therefore, the book industry is a little different from other retail ventures. Truthfully, it's fiendishly difficult to stay in business at all, much less turn a profit.<br/></p> <ul> <li>Book retail prices are usually printed on the books by the publishers and when we buy books from publishers and distributors we pay most of that retail price, with a small discount. The small margin between what we pay for a book and what we sell that book for - usually a few dollars per book if we're lucky - is where we have to get the ALL the funds for our payroll, occupancy costs, and store stock. Unlike the prices of food, toys, clothes, electronics, or other consumer goods, the prices of books can't be adjusted upwards quickly or easily to account for increases in overhead costs, which are rising all the time.</li>
<li>Author events cost money in terms of stocking the books, staffing the event, setting up the event, providing snacks and beverages, and publicizing the event. Thank goodness the publisher - or sometimes the author herself - usually pays for the author's travel expenses, food, and lodging. Yet even so, very rarely do we sell enough books at an event to even cover the costs associated with it. But still we love to host authors; the cultural benefit of their presence in our community far outweighs the financial burden of bringing them here.</li>
<li>We try to pay our employees living wages, which is almost twice Idaho's minimum wage. In a bookstore, giving you good service requires well-educated staff. Helping you find the book you want requires a different kind of skill than making you a great cappuccino. Also, most of us have families to support and student loans to pay.<br/>
</li> <li>Oh, and one other reason we can't adjust book prices upwards to set aside a little money for chairs and a sound system: Amazon controls a majority of the market for book sales in the United States. (Authors United and the American Booksellers Association is urging the U.S. Dept. of Justice to investigate Amazon as a possible monopoly and/or monopsony.) In the meantime, their use of books as a loss-leader for all their online sales of other consumer goods - and their failure to pay sales taxes in the states where their customers buy books - has put many independent bookstores out of business, constantly pressures the price of books downward, and takes away sales from independent booksellers like ourselves.<br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Maybe you just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p> <ul> <li>Please spread the word about our campaign by using all the Indiegogo share tools available.<br/>
</li> <li>Buy all your books at BookPeople of Moscow and encourage all your friends, family, and acquaintances to do the same! You can shop in person at the store at 521 S. Main in downtown Moscow, Idaho, or visit our website at <a href=""http://www.bookpeopleofmoscow.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.bookpeopleofmoscow.com</a>.<br/>

(Authors United and the American Booksellers Association is urging the U.S. Dept. of Justice to investigate Amazon as a possible monopoly and/or monopsony.) In the meantime, their use of books as a loss-leader for all their online sales of other consumer goods - and their failure to pay sales taxes in the states where their customers buy books - has put many independent bookstores out of business, constantly pressures the price of books downward, and takes away sales from independent booksellers like ourselves.
    Other Ways You Can Help Maybe you just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:  Please spread the word about our campaign by using all the Indiegogo share tools available.
 Buy all your books at BookPeople of Moscow and encourage all your friends, family, and acquaintances to do the same! You can shop in person at the store at 521 S. Main in downtown Moscow, Idaho, or visit our website at www.bookpeopleofmoscow.com.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

This statement, made by the developers behind the recently funded NVDA Remote Access project, helped to bring to light the issue faced by blind computer users everywhere. </p>
<p>Currently, blind computer users have two choices when it comes to gaining access to remote computing devices, something sighted people have been able to do for years, often using free apps to do so. They can either pay large sums of money to Aquire specialized software to do this in an accessible manner or use a product like NVDA Remote Access. However, both of the aforementioned choices assume both computing devices are running some version of Windows. AccessibilityHound Remote brings the remote control concept into the cross-platform arena, ensuring that blind people can maximize the potential of the technology they already own.</p>
<h3>How Will We Help Fight Unemployment?</h3>
<p>There are an estimated 70% of blind Americans (American Federation for the Blind) and an estimated 75% of blind europeans (European Blind Union) who are unemployed. By implementing cross-platform remote computer access and working with free and open-source screen reader venders, we seek to create job opportunities for blind people everywhere, especially in countries where access to traditional assistive technologies are priced far beyond the already outlandish North American prices.</p>
<p>By open-sourcing AccessibilityHound Remote, we hope to ensure that everyone can access affordable, accessible and quality assistive technology and its accompanying training, regardless of their geographic region or socioeconomic barriers. It is only through access to solid training and assistive technology that blind people will be able to keep up with the increasing demands of a connected life, both at home and at work.</p>
<p>AccessibilityHound Remote helps to secure access to assistive technologies by providing new opportunities for building smart networks of connected devices. For example, a trainer in Bowen Island, Canada can teach a new assistive technology user in Paris, France at a fraction of the cost typically associated with costly in person trainers.</p>
<h3>Why AccessibilityHound Remote?</h3>
<p>We at AccessibilityHound Remote wish to build on NVDA Remote Access' success to make sure that blind computer users everywhere can access remote computers, regardless of the operating system installed at both ends. While the NVDA Remote Access project concerned itself with creating accessible connections between Windows computers, we recognize that there are many different accessible platforms used by blind technology users. These include IOS/OS X and Apple's built-in VoiceOver screen access technology, Android and Google's Talkback, Windows/Windows Mobile and NVDA, among others.</p>
<p>We believe that blind people should have the same right to choose their computing platforms and mix and match as they see fit. Our approach reflects that, allowing users of any of the above platforms to control Mac or Windows PCs remotely, giving a freedom that today can only be dreamed of by blind people but that sighted people have enjoyed via apps such as Microsoft's Remote Desktop and Parallels Access.</p>
<p>For many blind people, the choice of one platform over another is economically driven, as many of them live on fixed incomes. These individuals should therefore be able to access the technology training and resources they need to complete work and independent living tasks from the technology that they already own.</p>
<h3>But Still, ... Why?</h3>
<p>AccessibilityHound offers the first cross-platform screen reader remote support package, combining security, reliability and a robust network into a package that can be installed anywhere, from the classroom, to home, to work. Furthermore, AccessibilityHound Remote is compatible with NVDA Remote Access and will be similarly developed with an open-source model, allowing anyone to learn how the software operates and add additional features.</p>
<h3>Why so much?</h3>
<p>Software as complex as AccessibilityHound Remote requires talented engineers from diverse backgrounds, including iOS, web, Android, Mac, Windows and Linux development. Hiring such talent usually costs a minimum of $70 an hour. However, Alex Jurgensen (Lead Software Engineer at AccessibilityHound) and the rest of our team have agreed to complete this project at a fraction of that hourly cost.</p>
<p>Every dollar raised will go into the research, development and ongoing support required to keep such a large and completes project working with the latest assistive technologies on the market.</p>
<h3>Why Should You Contribute?</h3>
<p>Blindness and the resulting unemployment is often accompanied by high rates of depression and feelings of low self-esteem. By contributing to AccessibilityHound Remote, you are giving blind people the chance to become employed and experience the basic human dignity that comes along with having the means to support oneself. Together, we can help put a stop to the financial buriers that have traditionally held blind people back from reaching their fullest potentials.</p></div>","""Would you pay more than $1,000 to remotely communicate with another computer?

<p></p>
<h3>My history</h3>
<p></p>
<p>I started my career when I was twenty years old, during my third year at Musashino Art University. One day, while I was washing a spoon, I noticed that tap water created a thin and transparent membrane when hitting the surface of the spoon. I also realized that this phenomenon created a dry area beneath the water membrane where my hand wouldn’t get wet. I was enchanted by this sudden discovery. I started dreaming about building a water dome that could cover my whole body.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439447220/x3n9t7t7myb6jastfm4x.jpg"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/></p>
<p>At first, I studied the six elements of a water membrane. Then, using many water pumps, I researched the mutual relationship between the water flow and the membrane’s diameter.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439447280/rr9tlwptlsiwvqiavuy1.jpg"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>As you can see, a 20cm water dome looks like a jellyfish. A 70cm one can be worn as headpiece, stimulating the five senses. The dry space under the water dome is limited to a diameter of about 2m. So, when I created a 8m water dome, the size of the dry space remained the same. In this case, the surface created by the running water is suitable for projection mapping. Visitors could enjoy the feeling of being underwater and at the same time watch the projected lights. </p>
<p>With my water dome project titled “Study of an immersive water display” I obtained my PhD at Tokyo University. My dream became to celebrate the importance of water with everyone, beyond countries and borders.</p>
<h3><b>Big Fountains Era</b></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439447315/o5x3h8zpf6wzttmyibmt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">From 1999 to 2009, I built 11 water domes at Japanese museums, department stores and rock festivals as temporary installations. Constructing and dismantling each water dome took 6 hours. The system is made of a pool, a water pump and pipes and a circular platform. In addition, electricity is needed for the circulation of the 13 tons of water needed to make the installation work and to provide energy to the lighting equipment. </span><br/></p>
<p>At times I was asked if I could build larger water domes. The answer was yes, but the space where people could stand under the running water without getting wet would still remain the same size. </p>
<p>I was really happy to be able make water domes, but, at the same time, I felt frustrated, because the quality of the entertainment didn’t always match up to my expectations. To make the water domes more enjoyable, I needed more water, fire, lasers and fireworks, but that wasn’t always possible. I also couldn’t built water domes whenever I wanted to, despite having designed them.</p>

<h3><b>Small but beautiful Fountains</b></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439447429/o1kobtlji7gpbndthbc7.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 228px; height: 228px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439447470/founfxmrvzyh39vvraja.jpg"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; width: 324.966101694915px; height: 231px; background-color: initial;""/></p>

<p>So I was determined to develop a small but beautiful fountain. As you know, my starting point was in the kitchen. I realized that a spork could generate a special shape with three antennas created by the pointed parts that were obstructing the water flow. After that I studied many types of shapes and finally developed five special ones: a butterfly, a spider, a dragonfly, a cherry blossom and an arabesque. </p>
<p>Thanks to my research, in 2013 Atelier OPA was awarded with the Lexus Design Award. During that time, I turned two of those particular shapes into finger rings. </p>
<p></p>
<div>Paola Antonelli, one of the judges and a senior curator of The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) commented “Poetic, effective, minimum effort &gt;maximum effect. It chooses delight as a goal and it achieves it.”<p></p>
</div>
<h3><b>3D Modeling</b></h3>
<p>Rapid prototyping helped me with finalizing the details. After drawing the shapes, our designer, Ishikawa turned them into 3D models.</p>
<p>Each time the model is completed we produce it by using a 3D printer and check the result under running tap water, making small changes as we go. Finally, I was able to obtain a final design. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439447595/gkmsdkacqluorct8ncpi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>After that I first worked with a wax model, which I later used to create a silver one. Lastly, a craftsman polished it and turned it into the final product. All these procedures were done in Tokyo, making Fountain Ring a product 100% made in Japan. These rings are the product of twenty years of research. I have also applied for Japan, US, EU and Chinese design patents.</p>
<h3><b>Wear it, create it and share it.</b></h3>
<p>You can wear these special Fountain Rings anywhere, anytime. While you wash your hands, draw a bath or play in the pool, you can enjoy your very own fountain. From now on, wherever you go, <b>the world is your stage</b>. </p>
<p>My hope is to share the pleasure of my works with everyone. After you got Fountain Rings, please send me your pictures, otherwise use hashtag as follwings:  #fountainowner  #fountainring  #butterflyring  #spiderring</p>

<p><b>Q. What about water consumption?</b></p>
<p><b>A. </b>The purpose of these rings is not to consume water, but to celebrate it and underline its importance. When washing your hands, drawing a bath or playing in the pool, these rings will remind you of the essentiality of water, making its user rediscover its fundamental qualities. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""></span></p>

There, the rocks and pebbles are used to represent water instead of an actual river. It is very unique and manages to evoke the image of water even without its actual presence. The same can be said for Fountain Ring, that represents water and fountains in a modern, charming and sustainable way, similarly to a dry garden.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q. When was your turning point as a fountain artist?</b></p>
<p><b>A. </b>After the great East Japan Earthquake of 2011. In Japan, many public fountains ceased to operate. In order to preserve energy and water, some of them have still not resumed operation to this day. I started thinking that despite the fact that art and design can’t permanently solve this type problems, they can still be used to understand and express the importance of water. Water circulates throughout the plant and enriches out lives. The human body consist largely of water and all creatures need to survive. So, I decided to celebrate the importance of water by developing a small but beautiful fountain. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q. Can I make a fountain in a bathroom or in
a kitchen in my house?</b></p>
<p><b>A.</b> It depends on the water flow. To make a
beautiful fountain, a clear and straight laminar tap water flow is the best. If
the water contains bubbles and has a not-transparent, turbulent flow, water will hit Fountain
Ring hard and become a spray. Find the best tap water in your house or office. That
is the place that water-butterflies and water-spiders can inhabit.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439669481/ypyxguuck891iltwfosf.jpg"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; width: 358.739px; height: 278px; background-color: initial;""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q. Can I make a fountain when I pour water
from a glass?</b></p>
<p><b>A. </b>No. The falling water that comes from a
glass is a bit twisted and not suitable for making a fountain equally on all sides. Tap water from facets, hoses and watering cans, such as water that comes from,
pipe is good for making fountains. By bringing the watering can to a pool, you
can enjoy a fountain without worrying about consumption of water. </p>

<h3>Possible risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Our concern is only about the date to complete and ship the rings. The design of Fountain Rings is done. Next step is mass production at a silver factory. We estimate that we can produce 50 rings per month. Craftsmen gradually get used to polish these special forms, they can make it faster and we can receive more rings per month. Moreover, engraving and plating take time. We check our products before shipment and when we found error, remake it again. We closed our campaign in the end of October, so that we scheduled to deliver these rings to you in December. We will do our best to send the rings at least it reaches to you before Christmas.</p>

Be the owner of your own fountain

Wear it, create it and enjoy it.
When you wear this ring and place it under running water, it will create a butterfly-shaped water membrane. I have also developed another ring that can create a spider shape. With these rings, you can be the owner of your very own fountain.


With our Butterfly Ring, you can enjoy the refined and fluttering shape of a water butterfly by placing the ring directly under running water. Or, by adjusting the water flow, with our Spider Ring you can experience the elegant and delicate curve of a water spider’s legs.

My history

I started my career when I was twenty years old, during my third year at Musashino Art University. One day, while I was washing a spoon, I noticed that tap water created a thin and transparent membrane when hitting the surface of the spoon. I also realized that this phenomenon created a dry area beneath the water membrane where my hand wouldn’t get wet. I was enchanted by this sudden discovery. I started dreaming about building a water dome that could cover my whole body.
At first, I studied the six elements of a water membrane. Then, using many water pumps, I researched the mutual relationship between the water flow and the membrane’s diameter.

As you can see, a 20cm water dome looks like a jellyfish. A 70cm one can be worn as headpiece, stimulating the five senses. The dry space under the water dome is limited to a diameter of about 2m. So, when I created a 8m water dome, the size of the dry space remained the same. In this case, the surface created by the running water is suitable for projection mapping. Visitors could enjoy the feeling of being underwater and at the same time watch the projected lights. 
With my water dome project titled “Study of an immersive water display” I obtained my PhD at Tokyo University. My dream became to celebrate the importance of water with everyone, beyond countries and borders.
Big Fountains Era


From 1999 to 2009, I built 11 water domes at Japanese museums, department stores and rock festivals as temporary installations. Constructing and dismantling each water dome took 6 hours. The system is made of a pool, a water pump and pipes and a circular platform. In addition, electricity is needed for the circulation of the 13 tons of water needed to make the installation work and to provide energy to the lighting equipment. 
At times I was asked if I could build larger water domes. The answer was yes, but the space where people could stand under the running water without getting wet would still remain the same size. 
I was really happy to be able make water domes, but, at the same time, I felt frustrated, because the quality of the entertainment didn’t always match up to my expectations. To make the water domes more enjoyable, I needed more water, fire, lasers and fireworks, but that wasn’t always possible. I also couldn’t built water domes whenever I wanted to, despite having designed them.

Small but beautiful Fountains


So I was determined to develop a small but beautiful fountain. As you know, my starting point was in the kitchen. I realized that a spork could generate a special shape with three antennas created by the pointed parts that were obstructing the water flow. After that I studied many types of shapes and finally developed five special ones: a butterfly, a spider, a dragonfly, a cherry blossom and an arabesque. 
Thanks to my research, in 2013 Atelier OPA was awarded with the Lexus Design Award. During that time, I turned two of those particular shapes into finger rings. 

Paola Antonelli, one of the judges and a senior curator of The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) commented “Poetic, effective, minimum effort >maximum effect. It chooses delight as a goal and it achieves it.”

3D Modeling
Rapid prototyping helped me with finalizing the details. After drawing the shapes, our designer, Ishikawa turned them into 3D models.
Each time the model is completed we produce it by using a 3D printer and check the result under running tap water, making small changes as we go. Finally, I was able to obtain a final design. 

After that I first worked with a wax model, which I later used to create a silver one. Lastly, a craftsman polished it and turned it into the final product. All these procedures were done in Tokyo, making Fountain Ring a product 100% made in Japan. These rings are the product of twenty years of research. I have also applied for Japan, US, EU and Chinese design patents.
Wear it, create it and share it.
You can wear these special Fountain Rings anywhere, anytime. While you wash your hands, draw a bath or play in the pool, you can enjoy your very own fountain. From now on, wherever you go, the world is your stage. 
My hope is to share the pleasure of my works with everyone. After you got Fountain Rings, please send me your pictures, otherwise use hashtag as follwings:  #fountainowner  #fountainring  #butterflyring  #spiderring

The best gift for someone special, or even for yourself!

It's not just a ring, but a whole new way to experience water. Each ring comes packaged in a velvet box, making it perfect as a present for someone special or even for yourself!

Color options and Rhodium plating
You can choose the color of the pleating. The colors currently available are: silver,  gold, rose gold, grey and black.


The Rhodium coating is made to last and to keep the ring's surface shining. However,  scratches or stain start appearing after using them, please ask a jewelry shop near you to pleat it again.

Laser engraving
By choosing an engraved ring, we will engrave up to 19 letters on the inside of the ring's band. A name, date or sweet message will make your ring even more special and  personal.

The available  fonts are:

HGP Mincho B
Monotype corsiva
Edwardian script JTC


Conversion table between USA, UK, EU and Japanese sizes
When choosing the ring's size, we recommend ordering the larger size because the ring's band is 6 mm thick. Please refer to the Japanese sizes when ordering your ring.




The Ring sizes and weights




Butterfly Small Ring :  height 1.1 cm, depth 2.8 cm, width 2.2 cm, weight 12 g.
Butterfly Regular Ring :  height 1.1 cm, depth 3.3 cm, width 2.5 cm, weight 13 g.
Spider Small Ring:  height 0.6 cm, depth 2.2 cm, width 2.3 cm, weight 13 g.
Spider Regular Ring :  height 0.6 cm, depth 2.6 cm, width 2.7 cm, weight 15 g.
The fountain's size of Butterfly ring
The size of the butterfly-shaped water membrane depends on the quantity of running water and the differences in the ring's size. 
When you use a Small ring to make a butterfly membrane, it's dimension will be around 11 cm in width, and you will need 0.3 litter of running water every 10 seconds. However, when you use a Regular ring, the membrane width will be  16 cm and you will need 0.33 litter of running water every 10 seconds.
In both cases, if you use much water the hourglass shape disappears and a large butterfly takes its place.

The fountain's size of Spider ring
Compared to the butterfly ring, the spider ring makes a rather larger fountain.  The size of the spider-shaped water membrane depends the quantity of running water, rather than the differences in the ring's size. Whether you use a Small or a Regular sized ring, 0.3 litter of running water every 10 seconds makes a fountain that has a diameter of 25 cm. When you use 0.4 litter of running water every 10 seconds, both rings make fountains that have a diameter of 30 cm.


We would love your help


The Fountain Ring is a new design so we look forward to hear your feedback. So far we have built fountains for various companies, and a total of more than a million people visited and took commemorative pictures at our water domes. Many of these people wanted us to keep the water dome permanently, but that wasn’t possible since they were part of temporary installations. But now is time to share our new fountains with everyone, in a permanent and inspiring way. Your contributions in this campaign will allow us to improve even more and develop new Fountain Rings so please don’t hesitate to contact us with any questions or comments you may have.

BUSINESS</b>?  </b></h3><p></p><p></p><p><b>My name is Judy Arellano, future Owner of Splash and Dash in
West Lake Mary/Orlando area.  It has been
a dream of mine for many years to work with animals, but my career path led me into
the health care industry.  It has been a
rewarding experience and it has allowed me to develop my business skills in an
environment of caring, respect, compassion, and understanding of others.  Armed with this knowledge and experience, I
am excited to move forward in fulfilling my true passion and dream – owning a
pet focused business that allows me to interact and “love on” man’s best
friend---our treasured pets.  </b></p><p></p><p><b>As a business manager for 20+ years in the health care field, I
have gained experience in leadership, accounting, accounts receivable, payroll,
marketing, human resources, and perhaps most importantly, excellence in customer
service.  My mother was an owner of her
own hair salon for 20+ years and as a child I watched her build a very
successful business by putting the customer relationship first.  Earning and maintaining our customer’s trust
and satisfaction with our service will be the #1 priority of the West Lake
Mary/North Orlando Splash and Dash Team. 
I am ready to integrate my business background with my crazy passion for
animals.  I am hopeful that you are
likewise ready to support me and become a paw member in my campaign to bring
quality pet grooming to the West Lake Mary/North Orlando area!  </b></p><p></p><p><b>Joining my team, will be my daughter Nicole, who has experience
in retail, inventory control, customer service, and has volunteered for

love of animals.  </b></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440722930/yka3qpt00qfa6xm1hfle.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 548.385922330097px; height: 365px;""/></p><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">We have lived in West Lake Mary/Sanford for 19 years and love

beyond business.  </b> We are making it a mission to bring awareness

begin by being a business sponsor of T.E.A.R.S. <span>(Together
Every Animal Receives Support) a fundraising organization for the homeless
animals in Seminole County, Florida.  I
am a volunteer for this worthy organization. 
This organization is passionate and dedicated to helping pets find
forever homes. I am grateful to be a part of this wonderful organization and
excited for Splash and Dash West Lake Mary/North Orlando to do more to help
animals find loving homes.  As our
business grows, I hope to support and sponsor other worthwhile animal charities
and events.  People say that today’s
businesses must learn to give back to their communities.  But, as I see it, the dogs and cats that I
will take care of are actually doing the “giving back”!  I find no greater pleasure than playing with
a happy (and clean!) dog!</span></p><p>Given

WHY

We are
bringing together our passion for people, our passion for animals, and our
passion for business!  When it comes to

Splash and Dash.  We are excited about
the future of our pet salon and ready to bring years of business experience
into a growing pet industry proven brand called Splash and Dash.      So for those who are tired of
bathing their pet, tired of the same old grooming cut at the big box store,
tired of your home smelling like your pet? 
We have a solution!  A convenient
way to pamper your pet that reduces your stress, eliminates odors in your home, and decreases your monthly expenses with our value membership service.WHAT IS SPLASH AND DASH?  We are a pet grooming salon with an
amazing boutique.  Moreover, it is our
exclusive unique signature membership service for the everyday dirty dog that
has made us standout.  We will offer an “unlimited
monthly bath and brush” service starting at only $39.95. This allows pet
parents to bring their pets in as much as they need to keep their pet looking
and smelling great!  We know your dog’s
need to get outside and be active, but this doesn’t mean you have to settle for
a dirty dog!  Our salon will offer a
full range of services for dogs and cats in addition to the monthly unlimited
bath and brush membership.  Our salon will
offer a clean, safe, and friendly atmosphere for your pets.  We will stand behind our salon by offering a
100% customer satisfaction guarantee.                                                                               Our boutique will offer a variety of specialty products for your pets.  To reach our
customers outside of our community, we will connect with our customers through
our website and most other social media outlets.  You will not have to live in our community to

OUR MISSION   
To provide a loving, safe, caring and
    professional environment to the pets whose care we have been entrusted;
To treat our customers with respect,
    service excellence and with business integrity; and
To be a forward thinking, pet passionate
    member of our larger community.  




WHO IS OPERATING THIS
BUSINESS?  My name is Judy Arellano, future Owner of Splash and Dash in
West Lake Mary/Orlando area.  It has been
a dream of mine for many years to work with animals, but my career path led me into
the health care industry.  It has been a
rewarding experience and it has allowed me to develop my business skills in an
environment of caring, respect, compassion, and understanding of others.  Armed with this knowledge and experience, I
am excited to move forward in fulfilling my true passion and dream – owning a
pet focused business that allows me to interact and “love on” man’s best
friend---our treasured pets.  As a business manager for 20+ years in the health care field, I
have gained experience in leadership, accounting, accounts receivable, payroll,
marketing, human resources, and perhaps most importantly, excellence in customer
service.  My mother was an owner of her
own hair salon for 20+ years and as a child I watched her build a very
successful business by putting the customer relationship first.  Earning and maintaining our customer’s trust
and satisfaction with our service will be the #1 priority of the West Lake
Mary/North Orlando Splash and Dash Team. 
I am ready to integrate my business background with my crazy passion for
animals.  I am hopeful that you are
likewise ready to support me and become a paw member in my campaign to bring
quality pet grooming to the West Lake Mary/North Orlando area!  Joining my team, will be my daughter Nicole, who has experience
in retail, inventory control, customer service, and has volunteered for
Seminole County Animal Shelter.  She will
assist in the store and bring value added with her patience, kind heart and
love of animals.  We have lived in West Lake Mary/Sanford for 19 years and love
our community.  I have watched Seminole
County grow into a pet lover’s community.  Our community is filled with doggie
awesomeness!  I am proud to be a part of
this pet friendly community and I look forward to getting to know more and more
people who share my passion and love of animals.WHY A FRANCHISE?                    
As an
extension to my business, this franchise provides knowledge, training, technology, and
continued support for years to come.  The
Pet Business is growing and having their experience will allow me time to focus
on our customer’s needs.
Splash and Dash
for Dogs is a proven brand franchise that I have come to know and love.  The more I read about this franchise, the
more I wanted to know.  It was like being
offered a seat on a rocket ship, “don’t ask what seat; just get on!” I knew
this was the business I could throw my passion into and succeed.

 In 2014, Splash and Dash made the
Inc. 500 list of one of the “Fastest Growing Privately held companies in the
USA”To

A 100% Customer Satisfaction GuaranteeOur convenient store will be located on SR 46, West Lake Mary,
in North Orlando, Florida.                                HOW ARE WE UNIQUE? Our passion for animals goes
beyond business.   We are making it a mission to bring awareness
to the many homeless pets in need of a loving home.  Through our store, social media, and our
website, we will spread the word!  We will
begin by being a business sponsor of T.E.A.R.S. (Together
Every Animal Receives Support) a fundraising organization for the homeless
animals in Seminole County, Florida.  I
am a volunteer for this worthy organization. 
This organization is passionate and dedicated to helping pets find
forever homes. I am grateful to be a part of this wonderful organization and
excited for Splash and Dash West Lake Mary/North Orlando to do more to help
animals find loving homes.  As our
business grows, I hope to support and sponsor other worthwhile animal charities
and events.  People say that today’s
businesses must learn to give back to their communities.  But, as I see it, the dogs and cats that I
will take care of are actually doing the “giving back”!  I find no greater pleasure than playing with
a happy (and clean!) dog!Given
my experience in health care, I fully recognize the unique and fulfilling role
pets play in the lives of senior citizens and the frail elderly.  I am passionate about helping connect senior
citizens with sheltered/rescue pets.Our commitment is not only to be the best store in our
community, but to raise awareness.  The
bottom line is, more lives will be saved because of your generous support!WHAT WE NEED AND WHY?  Our need is simple!  We do not have the financial resources to
open today, so we need your help.  Like
your pet, “large or small, we love them all”!

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Our Story</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">--- · ---</p>
<p>I’m Tatevik Aghababyan, the founder of the Debed Co-living and Workation House, designer, perpetual traveler and enterpreneur born in Armenia. After living 15 years in Germany, I traveled around-the-world almost 75.000km in 6 months to came back to Armenia in June 2016 and discover my homeland with brand new eyes.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1544270755/yowblq1lvgahlyrgeupp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">--- · ---</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Not only I realised how unique and special Armenia is, but I started identifying amazing potentials around me.</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Armenia is still very much undiscovered by traveler around the world</li>
<li>Its very compact and easy to explore - scenic nature, ancient cultural heritage, modern urban life, authentic rural experience - Armenia is a small country of wide choices!</li>
<li>Armenia is cheap to travel, safe and traveler friendly. </li>
<li>It has great connectivity and mobile coverage (both good and cheap - great news for digital nomads!).</li>
</ul>
<p>I also realised, that I've collected a lot of experience and knowledge during my years in Germany and around the world, that might be of vital importance for local economy. I didn't know how to make a better use of my global know-how and fresh perspectives, until I accidentally found myself in a little Village Debed, in the northern Lori Province.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">--- · ---</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The breathtaking scenery and the ""frozen-in -time"" life there were so authentic and enchanting, that inspired me to found a this project and share this hidden gem with the traveler around the world.</h3>
<p> </p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1544273460/ltubpx1khlvnjqfd53va.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Luckily I found a tiny house for sale right in the heart of the villages. Without hesitating I made the downpayment right the same week and marked the June 2016 as the beginning of my passion project.</p>
<p>Short after that I started working with local architect from Yerevan on the concept of the house.The initial plan to create a little hideaway evolved to a much bigger idea of shared living concept, where I could host like minded people to live and work together, and inspire each other. In summer 2017 we started the construction of the guesthouse by <strong>engaging local workforce only</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The Concept</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">--- · ---</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Shared living is not a novelty, however, sharing space and being productive can be challenging!</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The guests of our house should have cost effective and comfortable living, suitable for remote working in a healthy and vitalising surrounding, closely connected with nature &amp; midst local life. With the help of local architect Lucine Mkhoyan we crafted this concept reflecting the traditional architecture of the village with modern touch, keeping our main focus on the needs of modern (digital) nomads and location independent professionals.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1544269867/rcwob21iocl3u40sandi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our co-living &amp; workation house is located in Debed Village of Lori Province in Armenia. It merges seamlessly with the scenic landscape, facing south the soft green hills, which inspired us for the massive glass facade framed in traditional symmetrical shape. The local materials and the original remains of the old house define look of the new Debed House. With modern materials and construction techniques we aim to create high level of comfort meeting the needs of modern living, while being connected with nature and local life. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">--- · ---</p>

</div></div>","Our Story
--- · ---
I’m Tatevik Aghababyan, the founder of the Debed Co-living and Workation House, designer, perpetual traveler and enterpreneur born in Armenia. After living 15 years in Germany, I traveled around-the-world almost 75.000km in 6 months to came back to Armenia in June 2016 and discover my homeland with brand new eyes.

--- · ---
Not only I realised how unique and special Armenia is, but I started identifying amazing potentials around me.
 

Armenia is still very much undiscovered by traveler around the world
Its very compact and easy to explore - scenic nature, ancient cultural heritage, modern urban life, authentic rural experience - Armenia is a small country of wide choices!
Armenia is cheap to travel, safe and traveler friendly. 
It has great connectivity and mobile coverage (both good and cheap - great news for digital nomads!).

I also realised, that I've collected a lot of experience and knowledge during my years in Germany and around the world, that might be of vital importance for local economy. I didn't know how to make a better use of my global know-how and fresh perspectives, until I accidentally found myself in a little Village Debed, in the northern Lori Province.
--- · ---
The breathtaking scenery and the ""frozen-in -time"" life there were so authentic and enchanting, that inspired me to found a this project and share this hidden gem with the traveler around the world.
 

 
Luckily I found a tiny house for sale right in the heart of the villages. Without hesitating I made the downpayment right the same week and marked the June 2016 as the beginning of my passion project.
Short after that I started working with local architect from Yerevan on the concept of the house.The initial plan to create a little hideaway evolved to a much bigger idea of shared living concept, where I could host like minded people to live and work together, and inspire each other. In summer 2017 we started the construction of the guesthouse by engaging local workforce only.
 
The Concept
--- · ---
Shared living is not a novelty, however, sharing space and being productive can be challenging!
 
The guests of our house should have cost effective and comfortable living, suitable for remote working in a healthy and vitalising surrounding, closely connected with nature & midst local life. With the help of local architect Lucine Mkhoyan we crafted this concept reflecting the traditional architecture of the village with modern touch, keeping our main focus on the needs of modern (digital) nomads and location independent professionals.
 

Our co-living & workation house is located in Debed Village of Lori Province in Armenia. It merges seamlessly with the scenic landscape, facing south the soft green hills, which inspired us for the massive glass facade framed in traditional symmetrical shape. The local materials and the original remains of the old house define look of the new Debed House. With modern materials and construction techniques we aim to create high level of comfort meeting the needs of modern living, while being connected with nature and local life. 
--- · ---
Debed Co-Living & Workation House is designed to provide balanced mix of comfort, privacy and social experience - as much of each as desired.

 
THE GROUND FLOOR
The lofty ground floor is all about socializing, with the living and dining areas, the cozy library and the large kitchen merging with another outdoor kitchen with a stone oven remained from the old house. 

 
THE 1ST FLOOR
Here we have four comfortable bedrooms with private bathrooms. The rooms are spacious and include a work corner, for the times when privacy is preferred. 

 
THE ATTIC
The lofty co-working space is located in the panoramic attic. The views from here are the best. This is the spot for inspiring brainstorms and productive work sessions. Hi-Speed Wifi is available an all areas of the house.

 
The location
--- · ---
While Armenia is ""off-the-beaten-path"" for most of the traveler, the northern region of it is even less explored.
 

Lori Province is, undoubtedly, one of the most beautiful regions in Armenia. Canyons, mountains, lush forest, ancient churches, absolutely beautiful! Lori is rich of cultural treasures. Haghpat and Sanahin Monasteries, both UNESCO World Heritage Sites are located here. Odzun Church (5th Century) is one of the oldest Christian churches in the world, counts to Loris historical gems.

It is just 1,5-2 hours away from Yerevan, the capital city of Armenia. The Georgian border is just an hour away, thus the location is great for the ones, who want to explore both Armenia and Georgia. 
 

 
Lori will please the nature lovers with the wide choice of outdoor activities: whitewater rafting, hiking, trekking, horse riding, biking, you name it! Dilijan and Sevan Lake are really close and can be reached in less than an hour.

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>Aloha! My name is January, and I've spent the last 10 years teaching yoga, fitness, and nutrition here in San Diego. Within that time my dream has become to create a beautiful community gathering place for ALL things health and wellness.</p>
<p>Inspired by my childhood days in Hawaii, the wellness retreats we've led to the Fiji Islands, and our love of the outdoors, I want to bring a little of the <strong>wild</strong>ness of nature, and that slow easy pace of <strong>island</strong> time, to our city. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Wild Island Experience</h3>
<p>Imagine walking into a lush, urban jungle and rolling out your mat for a morning class; you'll move, sweat, and get a little high on oxygen with a breath-work session to close your class. Afterwards you might pop into the Finnish Sauna for more relaxation time, taking a dip into the chill plunge after to wake up your senses. Or roll up your mat and browse the greenery looking for a new plant baby to adopt. Maybe you'll pick up a brand new, totally clean-ingredient product - from natural deodorant to my favorite lunar-infused face serum. </p>
<p>You can also book a treatment with our in-house esthetician and sugaring specialist, to really treat yourself to a full self-care day. </p>
<p>Adding to your healthy routine of fitness and food, I want to offer a sanctuary space where you can come to breathe, unwind, and connect to nature in our urban jungle. All while shopping for household and body care items that are completely clean, that you can trust to truly nourish your body from the inside out. </p>
<p>We are on our way to creating this oasis, but we need your help! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Contribution</h3>
<p>With your support, the funds raised will pay for essential costs of building out our space. We've got a great start, but I want to bring in better flooring (so you can sprawl out and really relax in sweet sweet savasana), upgraded lighting (let's get a skylight in this baby for the plants!), and upgrades to our Sauna &amp; chill plunge patio.  </p>
<p>I've also been working diligently on connecting with all the makers of products that I love, have vetted, and 100% trust to use on my body and around the house, and your support will help me stock the shop with an amazing assortment of everything you might need to clean up your beauty, body care, and nourishment routine. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You'll Get</h3>
<p>We're excited about the perks we'e put together for you in gratitude for your contributions, from some sweet swag to discounted classes, early membership pricing, and special event &amp; workshop invites!</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge so far has been in completely jumping into this project with all I've got! This is now my job and my passion rolled into one, and it's always a little scary to become totally self employed! But I know that this space is what you - my community - want and <i>deserve</i><i>!</i> A true sanctuary space for all things health and wellness, and a place to connect to like-minded, eco conscious, kombucha loving people like us!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We plan on opening Renegade Kitchen April 15th, 2019. Renegade Kitchen will be a food truck that will provide craft breakfast fare for locals, as well as an expanded menu designed for catering events at local wineries. we will provide five breakfast sandwiches, three different kinds of grits and gravy, three salads, some smaller side options. We will also provide teas, coffee, seasonal smoothies, acai bowls, and soft drinks. With the lack of breakfast options in the surrounding area the goal is to provide quick, healthy, thoughtful food to local consumers on the go.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> It is Renegade Kitchens’ goal to use sustainable, local ingredients as a template for menu creation. The Willamette Valley has an abundance of agriculture that offers a wide selection of fresh, seasonal produce, as well as many farms that provide sustainable practices in the farming of livestock. With us being a few hours from the coast, it also offers a large array of seasonal wild-caught and farmed seafood. The Pacific Northwest is a mecca for agriculture and sustainable food culture.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Willamette Valley has seen a steady rise in local tourism in the last decade. The wine industry in Yamhill County has seen an exponential growth in traffic with no expected decline in sight and has become a premier destination in the world of wine tourism. Yamhill County has a disproportionate number of tourists to restaurants and places to eat, especially between the months of March and October. With a largely untapped market, we believe Renegade Kitchen will have an uninhibited entrance into the dining space and with the combined experience and energy of the team, will be wildly successful.</p>
<h2><strong>Who Are We?</strong></h2>
<p>Nicholas Bell, Co-Owner</p>
<p>     Nick Bell has worked in the food and service industry for a total of nine years and has worked in a variety of restaurants. In 2012 Nick attended Le Cordon Blue and then finished his culinary degree at Oregon Coast Culinary Institute. At these schools he learned classic French cooking techniques, and the base knowledge of French cuisine. He’s held a management position in different capacities for six years and one of his strongest skill sets is managing a team and training cooks on how to efficiently work a line during a busy service.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>     In 2014, Nick helped start a breakfast, bread, and coffee company called Silver Stallion Coffee and Bread in Gallup NM, where he designed, prepped, and served a brunch, breakfast, and sandwich menu. The next chapter of Nick’s career led him back to Portland Oregon, where he Accepted a line position at Ned Ludd under chef Jason French. In this position he trained new line cooks and took part in menu development. In 2017 he accepted a position at Ruddick/Wood, under chef Paul Losch as a sous chef wherein he managed a large team, as well as ordered from local/regional purveyors, managed inventory, oversaw menu development, catering, large animal butchery, and much line/prep training.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>     Nick has a strong understanding of how to utilize local and seasonal ingredients in the Pacific Northwest and has developed a strong love for live fire cooking which we hope to utilize through Renegade Kitchen. He has maintained many strong connections with local food purveyors in the Willamette valley and they will be his preferred source of food. In the culinary world there is never a ceiling for knowledge, but he is confident that he has the experience and drive to make Renegade Catering a success</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Wesley Jones, Co-Owner</strong></p>
<p>     Wesley is currently the owner of Tour Cascadia LLC, a wine and adventure tourism company. Tour Cascadia has grown from being run solely by Wesley to employing three people through the tour season and turned a profit by Q2 of the first fiscal year. The company is currently in the process of doubling its workforce in fiscal year two. The company has exceeded his expectations, and Wesley credits the number of word of mouth referrals for the unforeseen growth.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>    Wesley has a degree in business management and was the Student Body President of George Fox University in 2012/2013. His area of expertise is personnel management and is an expert networker. The majority of his work history has been in food, drink and hospitality. He has a combined eight years of barista experience, and three of those years were spent in a position of management. While completing his time as George Fox University, he accepted a valet position and moved into a front desk, guest services role at The Allison Inn and Spa. That experience was the introduction to the attention to detail and hospitality that he would base, and exceed, his treatment of guests in all business spaces.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>    Wesley has a deep belief that the treatment of employees and community are the most important way a person can effect change. The combination of transitioning from low man on the ladder, in the hospitality world, to owning a thriving company has given him the perspective and experience needed to provide the highest of customer service, as well as creating a working environment that is empowering and focused on meeting the needs of those that come alongside us to make this dream a reality.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>     We need a total of $20,000 to completely fund the project. We have already self funded several thousand of it ourselves and are working to secure some private funding. We are asking you to partner with us for a total of $10,000.</p>
<p>     Down below you will see all of the perks of participating in our funding campaign. We cant wait to feed you and get to know you on a personal level.</p>
<p>     If we don't get all of the funding needed to secure the truck, we will rent space in a commercial kitchen and continue to cater events and provide food options to wineries that don't want to, or are unable to start their own food program.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>     Your contribution will enable us to secure our truck. We are going to purchase the truck that was previously used by prominent local restaurant after they had to relocate due to a kitchen fire. It is perfectly set up to allow us to not only serve high quality food out of the truck, but to be able to cook on site for catering events.</p>
<p>     We have already catered events for groups ranging from 20 people, to 200 people.</p>
<p>     Our downtown location will provide high quality breakfast and lunch sandwiches and sides for an accessible price four days a week.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>      We don't have the capital to start this project on our own. We have already trimmed all of our expenses, nearly $15,000, to be able to launch. We have decided to both maintain employment to self fund as much of the project as we can. We are confident that within six months we will be able to allow nick to scale back from his other work to pursue cooking from the truck exclusively.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>     We know that not all of our neighbors have the means to contribute monetarily, but we would be so grateful if you could all help us spread the word about our project!</p>

For the coming seasons and into the new year, we have a packed lineup of community based events for adults and children. HERE'S WHAT WE NEED TO MAKE THIS A REALITY:We are looking to raise $60,000 to help pay for inventory, staff, and operational expenses.Hiring additional staff members and moving some part time staff to full time will allow both stores to quickly reach their full potential while continuing to provide quality service as we build strong, intellectual gathering places in the communities.A significant portion of the funds we raise will go towards opening a pop-up in Silver Spring, MD by fall 2019. We are looking to sign a lease immediately and start work on the space in the hopes of an October opening. We will be purchasing a vehicle for the store that will increase our ability to partake in events and host programs outside of the store such as book fairs and festivals. We will also use some of the money on renovations for The Reading Room (an event space we share with Petworth Citizen) to cover the costs of essential improvements that will allow us to increase the frequency and variety of event offerings! We will also finish work on the exterior of the store and update our entrance and lighting for improved safety. PERKS!

</div><div><b>Who We Are</b></div><div>
<p>Believe it or not you
are what you eat. Even though the influence of our diets may not always be so
obvious when we are young, after time goes by it becomes more and more
apparent that what we put into your bodies determines how well our bodies
function. Our Tagline is ""Relax. Rebalance. Reboot."" Sometimes we all
need to recharge not only our minds but our bodies as well. Juicing has had a long reputation for lowering blood pressure, strengthening the immune system, reducing cancer, clearing skin, weight loss, and more. Unfortunately, in today's world,
it really is hard and time consuming to find the time to consistently juice on a daily basis. Not only is it hard to find the time to juice,  but it is also hard to make good choices when
we are bombarded with unhealthy food ads, and have to drive past unhealthy fast food
restaurants on every corner.  That’s why we came up with the idea to promote 100% natural organic, fresh juices, snacks, organic chia puddings, gourmet overnight oats, juice cleanses, and more
for all ages. Greenery Juice is based in Orlando, FL. T<span style=""background-color: initial;"">he Company was founded by Dwayne R and Audrey A. Dwayne and Audrey came

We later purchased a juicer and found that we could incorporate pounds of produce into a single glass of juice.

I started to research the effects of juicing after hearing about the benefits that juicing had on my friend, Audrey and her mom.

<p><b>Our Process &amp; Services</b></p>
<p>Our juices are made only after the customer has selected
their option. We create the juices in our local licensed co-op kitchen, and we plan to deliver juices and other products to our
customers’ doorstep. We plan to build our website, which will contain recommended juices for customers with  particular needs. For example: we will list juices that can aid with weight loss, energy, promote healthy skin, and more. We also will have different recommendations depending on what flavors our customers like. Customers will even have the option of creating their own juice. We are in the process of developing an app where our
customers will be able to select their delivery date and times, and also get
notifications when we are on our way. That means nothing is sitting on the
shelf, all the vitamins will still be intact and the juices will be less than
24 hours old upon delivery. Our organic juices are not diluted with water, and other
additives that other juice making companies manufacture. This means that all
the powerful nutrients are kept intact and ready to be consumed once the juices
are delivered. Our juices contain anywhere from 3 to 15 different fruits and vegetables.</p>

This way we can create a sort of base. From there we can work further towards our goals and start the second phase.</div>
<div><b>The second phase:</b></div> <p></p>
<p></p>
<div>
<p>First of all, we want to create a vibrant city center that will house a Greek-style Senate, temples, a marketplace, a theatre, an arena for Olympic-style games, and then have smaller buildings surrounding the city center – temples, schools, houses, stables, farms, and many other buildings as well.  If we can find someplace with levels, I’d like to build an Acropolis or high city up on a cliff overlooking the main city.  The best part is that every building will be built with environmentally friendly materials and will be run on renewable and green energy. </p>

<br/><p>Chloropolis will be a cross between a tourist attraction and a real, working city.  We are going to create some replicas of actual Greek villas or traditional hotels for our guests.  All guests and permanent citizens will be given an opportunity to select a Greek name they would like, and can choose to wear a Chiton or Greek tunic when going around the city.  They are actually extremely comfortable in the hot and humid Mediterranean climate.  </p>

<p>And that's all there is to it! <br/><br/>Let's create Chloropolis and change the world!!</p>
<br/>
</div></div>","We have an amazing dream and together we can make it come true. We want to create a utopian city-state that will be named Chloropolis.  It will be modeled on ancient Greek cities such as Athens, Delphi, or Olympia.We're not sure yet whether this will be on its own island, or just a large parcel of land somewhere, but it will be a beautiful and peaceful place where people can come for a brief vacation, or somewhere to live permanently. It will even have an opportunity for people to become a virtual citizen of Chloropolis and enjoy some of the benefits remotely – terrific for people who are unable to travel often due to family or work commitments.
How it began:Ever since reading the books, works and thoughts of the great Greek philosophers I was fascinated by the ancient Greek culture and way of life. The philosophy, the politics, the army, the wars and everything else. Reading Homer only added to that fascination.I often thought about what it would be like to live in that time. To live in that time AND have acces to modern technology had to be even better I thought!That's how the idea of Chloropolis was born.

What We Need & What You Get


The first phase:
This crowdfunding is part of the first phase in the building of Chloropolis.This means that we will use whatever we collect to start building a community (virtually and in real life), buy a piece of land or an island, and maybe build the first few buildings if possible. This way we can create a sort of base. From there we can work further towards our goals and start the second phase.
The second phase: 


First of all, we want to create a vibrant city center that will house a Greek-style Senate, temples, a marketplace, a theatre, an arena for Olympic-style games, and then have smaller buildings surrounding the city center – temples, schools, houses, stables, farms, and many other buildings as well.  If we can find someplace with levels, I’d like to build an Acropolis or high city up on a cliff overlooking the main city.  The best part is that every building will be built with environmentally friendly materials and will be run on renewable and green energy. 

                                 
Chloropolis will be a cross between a tourist attraction and a real, working city.  We are going to create some replicas of actual Greek villas or traditional hotels for our guests.  All guests and permanent citizens will be given an opportunity to select a Greek name they would like, and can choose to wear a Chiton or Greek tunic when going around the city.  They are actually extremely comfortable in the hot and humid Mediterranean climate.  


Another great feature is that Chloropolis will be run in a true Greek tradition of Democracy.  The citizens will be allowed to vote on a flag, a method of currency, the Patron Gods of the City, as well as the members of the Senate that will decide the laws, rules and customs of our little community.  

                       
One of the most important areas of the city will be “Temple Square”.  We will create at least two big temples there and maybe a few smaller ones.  One will be for the Patron God of the city, and one will be to honor our financial contributors.  Each contributor over a certain level will be given the chance for a statue of their very own to remain permanently in the temple of the backers.  
We are also planning a city-wide “Olympic” games every two years.  Our citizens will compete against each other until we have the top representatives in every category.  Then we will compete against other invited nations for the International Championship and Gold, Silver, and Bronze medals.  The games will be based not on traditional, modern Olympics, but will be modeled on the historic Greek games – (although we will not follow the original tradition of competing entirely in the buff!)  We will design some type of appropriate sports outfits, and will  pursue a traditional training program. 

Since education was a very important principle in Ancient Greece, our city will have an academy for all ages.  This building will be very important because in the academy people will be able to receive wisdom. There will be guest speakers in Science, Physics, Astronomy, Philosophy, Theology (Atheism), as well as courses in traditional Greek Philosophy.  There will also be a lot of research on green practices and renewable energy, so we will help to keep the Earth and its people healthy.
