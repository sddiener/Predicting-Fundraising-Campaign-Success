eeodo is a fledgling publisher making artist’s books. While supporting invention and speculation we are committed to developing a broad audience and promoting the idea that art, whilst innovative and esoteric is also an everyday human exchange.
In publishing our first titles, Where is That Light Now? and Cash or Smash, we developed an exemplary approach to the design, production and distribution of artist’s books. 
As a nonprofit organisation, we are presently establishing firmer foundations, along with a variety of funding sources. As well as preparing Technologies of Romance (Part 1) we are planning a series of small publications to be commissioned from guest artists.



About the book

Technologies of Romance (Part 1) is an illustrated paperback in which personalised research and memoir is balanced with a historical perspective. 
It forms the first of a series of three books that will bring an array of 'technologies' into productive dialogue with varying notions of 'romance’.
Based on the author’s long-running undergraduate seminar of the same title, the series will provide an imaginative means of exploring cultural history in the context of current technologies.
Technologies of Romance (Part 1) will be launched in early Spring 2017 when a roster of influential artists and academics will respond to the title during a day-long symposium.




About the author
Paul O'Kane is an artist, writer and lecturer who, having worked for 30 years across fine art, popular music, photography and writing, published (as one third of eeodo) his first book Where Is That Light Now? in 2014.
Paul completed a PhD in History at Goldsmiths in 2009 and teaches in London’s leading Fine Art colleges. He publishes in leading art journals and exhibits as an artist working with a history of technologies. 



Why Crowdfunding?
This is the first time eeodo has used crowdfunding. While pursuing conventional sources we became interested in the way crowdfunding publicly shares in the fundraising process. As such, it offers new possibilities for contact with an expanding audience, and potentially influences the outcome of a project. 
We are also interested in the way that the 21st century 'crowd' might exist in a dynamic form online, capable of changing the world of ideas, society, art and politics. These are themes that resonate with the content of this book and previous eeodo publications.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Elvie Schooley. I have a Masters degree in social work administration/nonprofit development. In 2004 West African drum and dance changed my life. This art form has provided me with an avenue of positive connection to my ancestral heritage.</p>
<p>In 2015 I created DRUM the Program as a teaching platform to share my passion. We provide a service of art experience that builds self-esteem, cultural diversity awareness, and community.</p>
<p>The original Congo Square took place in New Orleans, Louisiana. Congo Square is now known as Louis Armstrong Park. It was the first gathering space in the United States that celebrated and hosted diverse cultures. Recreating Congo Square with an intention for celebrating cultural diversity will bring together the communities surrounding the Vortex theater. We believe that engaging in indigenous art forms provide a space  for individuals to grow, increase understanding, and participate in community.</p>
<p>Each day of this free event will offer drum class, a journey in history, entertainment, and audience participation. The goal is for audience members to walk away with inspiration to engage in diverse cultural experiences that create bridges to building community. This outcome will in-turn support indigenous art programs and expand the awareness of the participant. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Join us in raising $4000. This campaign will provide financial support to meet the budgetary requirements of presenting Congo Square. Funds will go to pay performing groups, provide for video documentation, and support future Congo Square events.</p>
<p>Cool perks include:</p>
<ul>
<li> DRUM the Program t-shirts. The front of the shirt sports the DRUM the Program logo. The back of the shirt contains a line from our positive affirmation “My Culture Is Unique.”</li>
<li>Original stain glass piece.</li>
<li>Bogolan African fabric and leather handbags</li>
<li>Hand carved African mask imported from Guinea West Africa.</li>
</ul>
<p>All funds will support performing artist, video documentation, and future Congo Square events.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are inundated daily through the media with images and messages that speak to a lack of value for others because they are different in some way than the majority in power. This type of propaganda serves to de-sensitizes us to the suffering experienced by the victim. Within our country we have a history of human atrocities that have never been spoken too. Even our education system has been redesigned to not teach the truth of our history. But, if we are to grow as a conscious living breeding society we must teach about the past and educate our youth on how not to re-create a future civilization that has grown numb to the sight of human atrocities.</p>
<p>We advocate that the engagement in diverse cultural experiences will broaden the mind and consciousness of participants. All cultures hold the constructs of identity. Components such as, language, music, dance, style of dress, and family traditions are found inside of every culture. When we  reach to explore and experience diverse cultures we grow in our awareness and humanity.</p>
<p>Congo Square is a cultural event that offers education through the experience of folk art. This event will showcase four indigenous communities. Participants will walk away spiritually uplifted, and inspired to engage and explore diverse cultures. Indigenous arts hold the history, and build community through providing enriched human experiences.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Challenges with this type of project are with management and organization. My approach to this event is to empower my Project Manager Princess Jenkins with the responsibility of logistical oversight. Her tasks will be to coordinate the flow of the public and artisan market. My responsibilities will include masters of ceremony and tell the history of Congo Square as it is connected each indigenous group. Other support with this event will be provided by members of the Vortex staff.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I am beyond grateful for this opportunity to share my love and knowledge of the benefits to engaging in cultural diversity and how it impacts awareness. I am also thankful to each of you who have taken the time to read and support this event.</p>
<p>The true success of this project is not just in reaching our financial goal but, it is in the lives that stand to be impacted by the experience.

Heavy-weight coated paper and top-of-the-line digital printers ensure the work inside is presented as rich and vibrant as possible, giving the finished piece a beautiful, tactile feel.

We really love sharing the gift with you; it is why we do this. If 200 people can show us some love in return giving $20 dollars, we will have more than met our goal. We love the love you give us on playa, but we would really appreciate some financial love if you are able.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Perks, Schwag, Gifts, Etc.</h3>
<p>We will be offering limited gifts for the fundraiser as we do not believe in making trinkets that people will barely use, if at all. T-shirts and necklaces are fun when you get them, but do you ever really use them? Yeah, neither do we. We will have two big prizes: both private tours on the Mushroom Patch you are helping us to rebuild!  The big tour will be 3-4 hours long, and you can coordinate 15 people to bring with you! The 1 hour tours will be scheduled into the spaces left after the big tour winner has chosen their time. Tours will be scheduled for Tuesday night after 9pm and the others will be Thursday day or night, your choice!</p>
</div></div>","Your support is vital to help us continue bringing the Mushrooms to the playaBuilding and maintaining an art car is a labor of love, and a very expensive one at that. We have spent thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours just this year alone renewing the car almost completely. The foam is cushy and new, the fur is funky and fresh, and the new sound is amazing. We are by no means a ""sound"" car, but we think you will be very impressed with our new experience. Did I mention the lights? Six years of LED technology advancements since our original build have allowed us to make them brighter, richer, and more complex than ever before.

<div>The plush have already completed production and are waiting to be shipped out! The risks we may face will be if customs takes longer to process our shipment, as this is something that normally happens. </div>
<div>Air Freight is generally much faster however and normally goes through customs faster as well which is why we've chosen to use Air Freight Shipping vs. Ocean Freight shipping which can take 1-2 months to be delivered. </div>

Rainbow Cat NECK PILLOWIf we unlock the Neck pillow, backers will unlock new reward tiers where they can get the Neck Pillow for a special discounted price!


This includes the production costs to make it, the freight shipping, and Indiegogo/Paypal fees!STRETCH GOAL #2 ------$13,385 
""Neko Maki"" Sushi Cat Plushie


This includes the production costs to make it, the freight shipping, and Indiegogo/Paypal fees!  The above image is the Prototype. The final version may very slightly. The Plushies are only going to get cuter from this point forward!

___________________________________________________MY STORY:My names Heather Bloss, but many know me as Cloe! I'm an artist/designer who has been duped by the cuteness of Cats. Since graduating in 2010. I've had the pleasure of working as a contract freelancer on SKULLGIRLS, designing mascots for anime conventions, Winning New York Anime Festival's 2010 Mascot Contest and being featured as a top contestant in Chiquita Banana's sticker contest. WHO KNEW RIGHT? I love all the crazy different projects I've worked on, but something kept calling out to me...Besides the random cats I rescue off the streets..

I think we all get to a point in our lives where we decide. ""What really makes me feel happy and complete?"" My answer came to two things: CATS and ART!
That's when Rainbow Cat was created!  



Along with other dorky cute cat designs, I set out to share my love with cats and their funny/bizarre personalities with the world. That's how Spoonful of Cats started!



I'm SO CLOSE to achieving a huge goal, and that goal is making my very first design; RAINBOW CAT, into a plush toy!





Front and Back view so you can see it's cute lil tush and tail also~
LOOK AT THOSE PAW PADS AND THAT CUTE FACE! Both Squish-able and Hug-gable of course~

___________________________________________________
HOW CAN I GET A RAINBOW CAT PLUSH
___________________________________________________

Just click ""Contribute Now"" and pledge the amount for the reward you want!

___________________________________________________HERE'S WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP___________________________________________________Thanks to early preorders on our website and our supporters at conventions we've raised about 2/3rds of the money we need to cover production costs!! To help keep costs low I'm having each backer pay for shipping.HOWEVER, we still need that final push to help cover the remaining 3rd of costs as well as air freight shipping costs!! Every little bit helps and you can make up your own amount that you wish to contribute if you want to pledge more or less!
I've decided to work with DHL as our global shipping agent to ensure a timely and safe delivery. Shipping alone will cost close to $2,000 due to the distance they must travel, customs fees, and broker fees, etc. Another $300 accounts for the Indiegogo fees.
___________________________________________________
What if I Pre-ordered before the Indiegogo?
___________________________________________________No worries! You're still set to receive a Rainbow Cat plush then! You don't need to pre-order again if you pre-ordered prior to this, UNLESS you wish to get a 2nd Rainbow Cat plush!____________________________________________________________________________They're estimated to arrive this March, hopefully before EastCoast's most exciting anime convention: ANIME BOSTON which they would debute at!

___________________________________________________DETAILS ABOUT PRODUCTION___________________________________________________


I have been working with a great factory overseas in China. This has developed into a wonderful relationship with the factory, who has worked very hard to bring Rainbow Cat to life. I believe in quality, and after 4-5 revisions we created the perfect Rainbow Cat plush. Seriously, it has pawpads and everything!Check out the process we went through to create her below!

___________________________________________________

    Risks & Challenges___________________________________________________

The plush have already completed production and are waiting to be shipped out! The risks we may face will be if customs takes longer to process our shipment, as this is something that normally happens. 
Air Freight is generally much faster however and normally goes through customs faster as well which is why we've chosen to use Air Freight Shipping vs. Ocean Freight shipping which can take 1-2 months to be delivered. 
By working with DHL to handle our shipment of Rainbow Cat Plush toys we know they'll be delivered in a timely manner.
_____________________________________________________________________________
    I Don't have money D: ! How else can I help??
_____________________________________________________________________________ The internet is an amazing thing. You can help us out a lot by sharing the indiegogo campaign on any social media outlets while the campaign is running.

<h3>Ballet Hawaii gives cast, audience, students, families, and supporters a brand new Nutcracker.</h3>
<p><u><strong>The Nuts and Bolts of Grandeur</strong></u></p>
<p>In keeping with our mission, Ballet Hawaii has been enriching Hawaii's cultural environment by teaching, presenting, producing, and promoting dance since 1976.  One way Ballet Hawaii promotes dance is through its Angel Program which makes it possible for 2,000 ""Title 1"" children to see ballet productions. This December children-in-need and military families will be mesmerized by the beauty and grandeur of the new Nutcracker. The Angel Program provides transportation and free admission to the performance. As a non-profit organization we appeal to a world-wide audience to help us continue our work.</p>
<p>Septime Webre, choreographer and former artistic director with the Washington Ballet, is creating a Nutcracker for Hawaii audiences.  They will enjoy all of the holiday tradition but with historical characterizations of Washington Place resident Mary Dominis and Hawaii’s beloved Queen Lili’uokalani. In this production, the flowers are Hibiscus, birds are I’iwi and new island animal performers are introduced such as the Ho’nu (sacred Hawaiian turtle). The toy soldier uniforms are patterned after those of the Royal Guard and the famous waltz of the snowflakes takes place high upon the slopes of Mauna Kea.  The production will be accompanied by the Hawaii Symphony Orchestra and feature dancers from major ballet companies from across the United States as well as hundreds of local dancers.  Your support will make possible an extraordinary set of performances on December 16th through 18th at the Neal S. Blaisdell Concert Hall.  Hawaii will enjoy this new production for years to come. </p>

<p>We need to raise $830 to pay for new top-of-the-line cover art for the third novel. The new cover artist is David Auden Nash, reknowned for his excellent artwork on properties for SHADOWRUN, GAME OF THRONES, WARHAMMER 40,000 and CALL OF CTHULHU.</p>
<p>$750 goes to Mr. Nash for his artwork; the remaining 9% is overhead from Indiegogo. If we make our target, however, Indiegogo's share drops to 4%, and Chris will use the difference to produce a special thank-you product for everyone who contributed.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Chris makes his living as a high school teacher, so paying for top-quality artwork is difficult on his salary.

Metamor City is the award-winning science fiction/urban fantasy universe that took the podcast world by storm in 2008. In 2009 the first novel, MAKING THE CUT, won the Parsec Award for Outstanding Long-Form Audio Drama. In Fall 2013, the new Metamor City novel THINGS UNSEEN debuts in ebook and audio, with a trade paperback edition to follow. Now head author Chris Lester is hard at work on the third novel in the series, THE LOST AND THE LEAST, and he needs your help to bring it to life.

<p>My name is Maquette and together with other artists and business owners, we volunteer to be the permit-holding, service providers for a once renegade art festival that happens monthly on our neighborhood mainstreet in the Alberta Arts District of Portland, Oregon. </p>
<p>For the past fifteen years, once a month, especially in the warm ones, our street fills with artists selling their work hanging from chain-link fences or on card tables. Buskers and musicians line the street. Kissing booths gather dollars while a parade of stilt-walking bathers in a tub dance by. The fire performers gather and the food carts billow with steam. <strong>Welcome to <a href=""http://www.lastthursdayonalberta.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Last Thursday on Alberta"">Last Thursday</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Friends of Last Thursday</strong> <strong>volunteers are the host of the party</strong>. Besides carrying the permit and holding the insurance, we provide the services including the security personnel, a friendly crew of neighborhood ambassadors, toilets, trash and recycling, and street closure. Last Thursday is free for attendees and all artists, performers, buskers, musicians and creatives to participate and vend. We pay for all of this by holding fundraisers, seek out grants, find volunteers and ask for donations. We do not allow direct corporate sponsorship so as not to change the nature of this grassroots, low barrier, micro-business generating, truly creative event. Oh, and did I mention that we had 20,000 visitors to our street for two of the summer months last year?</p>
<p>It is our <strong>Street Operations Team</strong> that is on site at each of the peak summer events (May-September). They build the street closure signs and barricades to city specs, maintain these in working condition, and place them on each of the 32 side street entrances. Street Ops set out garbage/recycling bins and oversee port-o-potty placement. At 10:00 the event ends and the team opens the street as they remove all of the above via a borrowed truck and trailer.</p>
<p><strong>FoLT is wanting to purchase a used box truck for our Street Operations Team.</strong> We will take that box trailer and retro-fit it to carry all of the barricades, street signs, and garbage/recycling bins and what they get filled with at the end of the night.

<h3>Painting with Raney <em>television art instruction show</em>
</h3>
<p>I have been a professional artist in the field of painting since 1981.  After five years of teaching elementary school art classes I decided to dedicate myself to full time painting and began teaching privately and in workshops throughout the southeastern US.  I also began painting plein air while travelling abroad.  I work in oils, acrylics, watercolors and pastels.  My style is representational with an emphasis on naturalist techniques for wildlife, landscapes, still lifes and portraits.  I have studied under many master painters such as Robert Bateman and Daniel Greene.  In 1994 I opened the first art gallery in my town where I still own the Acorn Gallery and write arts articles for newspapers and magazines.</p>
<p>It is my belief that we are all spiritual beings with a creative gift to hone and honor which can be applied to all aspects of our lives for a more authentic and soulful journey.  My purpose is to encourage and guide others to find their own special gift and use it to enhance their lives and the lives of those around them, an art ""ripple"" effect of sorts.</p>
<p>In the desire to reach out to others I decided that the media of television was the best way to achieve this so I produced a ""Sizzle Reel"" for PBS which was given positive reviews and encouragement to produce thirteen thirty minute shows, which is the minimum required for air time on the station.  Because PBS is publicly supported, all projects come to the station already fully funded and ready for broadcast.   I have been given the chance to create a new venue of art instruction with my show ""Painting with Raney"", a fun, educational and interactive experience for viewers of all ages.</p>
<p>Producing a television show is neither easy or inexpensive.  Each show will cost approximately thirteen thousand dollars to produce.  Then there is the cost of studio space, travel, lodging and food for a crew of six and props, as well as marketing and clerical expenses.  Your contribution to help in producing these next thirteen shows will enable me to generate viewership, contract for ongoing shows with future syndication and open possibilities for air time on other networks.  Name recognition for me through the shows will further promote and generate sales of my art, all of which will allow me to continue to nurture and promote the joy of creativity in others, which brings joy into my own life as well.</p>
<p>In thanks of your contribution I am offering perks at different levels which are designed to enhance the appreciation of art, for novice collector to art patron, some of which also include participation in the studio as an art student on my show.  Reaching my goal will allow production of all thirteen shows, which will create the minimum needed for a quarter year's air time schedule.  If I am unable to meet production for all thirteen shows, I will still produce as many episodes as possible to create viewership and the potential for future investment by sponsorship on another network.</p>
<p>I have seen how encouragement of the creative spirit has changed people's lives and made them more confident, joyful and unique and I believe that these are the qualities which create a world of wonder, discovery and belief for a more fulfilling life in each of us.  We are all creative individuals with something to offer and art is the truest expression of ourselves that we can give.  To produce this show will allow the expression of encouragement to others anywhere, anytime.</p>
<p>With your help I know that this dream can become a reality.  If you are unable to contribute to this campaign you may also spread this wonderful opportunity to your friends and family by using the Indiegogo ""share tools"".  Check out the perks offered and see what you might like to have in a gracious ""thank you"" for recognition of your participation and support.</p>

<p><span>We will be plucking up the courage to take the jump and skydive from 13,000ft. Skydiving isn’t something we normally do, so please help us by supporting the success of the abcSkydivers in their goal to raise money for their degree show through a donation. We’d appreciate it so much and would more than happy to keep you updated with whats happening to your money at The Orchard, which you can read more about below.</span></p>

<h3><span><strong>The Orchard</strong></span></h3>
<p><span>The Orchard is how we have branded ourselves as a class of students graduating from the University for the Creative Arts, Farnham with a BA(HONS) in Advertising &amp; Brand Communication. We’re big on ideas, creativity, problem solving and strategic thinking. We work hard and approach everything in a creative way. Each of us have a thorough understanding of the key areas of the industry, but we individually specialise in the areas of Advertising and Branding that we love the most.</span></p>
<p><span><br/> We are as a group trying to fundraise to put our final year degree show on in London. This degree show is all self funded by the students of The Orchard as we have no help from our university with funding, so we are constantly trying to fundraise! So far we have carried out events such as a night at our student union sponsored by Dominos pizza, a craft stall at the local christmas market, cake sales, a Just Dance competition and the latest event The Pitch - a ad-industry football tournament that we put together. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>We’re excited to announce that during May we’ll be presenting the best of our work to our industry and the public at The Dray Walk Gallery, The Old Truman Brewery in Shoreditch. The Grad Show is the best opportunity to showcase our finest creativity in Traditional and Digital Advertising, Branding, Strategy, Social Media and Planning. We can’t wait to show you what we’re capable of and would love for you to visit us.</span></p>

<h3>I found jewelry making by accident</h3>
<p>I took metalsmithing/jewelry design as an elective toward my degree in art in college. One time melting precious metal and I was hooked for life.  I've been making jewelry in one form or another for more than 20 years, from lost wax casting and fabrication, chain maille, beading, and then Art Clay Silver</p>
<p>Like many artists, I've worked a vast array of jobs while dreaming of the day I could actually support myself with my art.  I've been looking for a new form, new media to work in, something that could make the dream of supporting myself with my jewelry possible.  By using a old technique with new materials, I've created something different, new, and very exciting.</p>
<p><img alt=""Twilight Bracelet"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/lisagems/6128103/24993/24993_900.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Twilight Bracelet""/></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The wire weaving is also supported by Art Clay Silver work, and more traditional cast silver like the celtic knot pendent below.</p>
<p><img alt=""Signature Knot"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/lisagems/6128103/25135/25135_900.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Eternity Celtic Knot""/></p>
<p>Also with pearl and gem beaded jewelry.</p>
<p><img alt=""Meadow Pearls"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/lisagems/6128103/25448/25448_900.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Spring Meadow pearl and peridot""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How your contributions Help:</h3>
<p>To move this from an 'after work' hobby to a sustainable business, I've written a business plan which include the development of a visual identity and website for LisaGems Jewelry Design, the registration of the business, purchase of materials and display, and an aggressive schedule of shows and sales visits to area boutiques.</p>
<p>There are many expenses related to the start up of a new business, but for a craft based business, perhaps the largest expense is the up-front cost of show registration.  The better the show the larger the registration cost.  The three primary shows I'm focused on are The Renegade Craft Fair in Chicago, Custer's Last Stand in Evanston, and the One of a Kind show in Chicago.  Each is a unique show.  Renegade brings artists from all over the country with a focus on a younger audience.  Custer's is an long established show with a large audience.  The One of a Kind Show is a high-end gift show that has been rated as one of the top 200 shows in the country.<br/><br/>I am confident of my ability to win jury approval for each of these shows.  The woven wire bracelet line is unlike anything I seen in my research at any of these show, or at smaller local shows.  Your contributions will help cover the registration and table costs.</p>
<p>I am well on my way to having sufficient stock for the first of these shows, but it is time to restock the materials for making more, and also those to build a unique display unit designed to make it easy for the shopper to see the bracelets and to get the bracelet to try on.</p>
<h3>What your help to me gets you!</h3>
<p>Every contribution helps move this campain to its goal however small or large, and I am grateful for any assistance, but getting goodies for your help doesn't hurt.</p>
<p>For a $15 contribution, you'll receive a semi-precious gems stretchy bracelet. (random selection)  Each bracelet comes with a thank you card, explaining what the gemstone is and what it's properties are.</p>
<p><img alt=""stretchies"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/lisagems/6128103/47371/47371_900.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Stretchy Bracelets""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For $25 you'll receive a woven wire pendent. (random color selection)</p>
<p><img alt=""Pile of pendents"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/lisagems/6128103/47314/47314_900.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Woven Wire Pendents""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For a $50 contribution, you'll receive a custom, four strand, 1 or 2 color woven bracelet.  Contributor may specify colors, and give wrist size for comfortable fit.  Available colors are:  magenta; red; orange; yellow; lime green; dark green; sapphire blue; purple; brown; black; and raw copper.</p>
<p><img alt=""4 Strand 2 Color"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/lisagems/6128103/47705/47705_900.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Custom 4 strand""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For $75, contributors will receive a custom, six strand, 2 or 3 color woven bracelet.  Contributor may specify colors, and give wrist size for comfortable fit.  Available colors are:  magenta; fuchsia; pink; red; orange; yellow; lime green; dark green; ice blue; peacock blue; sapphire blue; dark blue; lavender; purple; brown; amber; antique bronze; hematite; black; and raw copper.</p>
<p><img alt=""6 strand 3 color"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/lisagems/6128103/48374/48374_900.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Custom Six Strand""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>At $100, contributors receive an eight color, 3 wire per color, woven bracelet in a rainbow.  Contributor may request frame and wrap colors, and provide wrist measurement for comfortable fit.</p>
<p><img alt=""Puppy with a rainboq"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/lisagems/6128103/52837/52837_900.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""3 In 8 Rainbow""/> </p>
<p>A contribution of $250 brings a bracelet woven in Sterling Silver or Sterling Silver and Gold-filled wire.  The more traditional version of this technique makes a lovely versatile accessory.</p>
<p><img alt=""SS-GF"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/lisagems/6128103/48632/48632_900.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Sterling &amp; Gold-filled""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For the contributor who is able to give $500, I will make a bracelet with a technique I am still teaching myself, but will have mastered by the end of the month.  A The basket weave is a more difficult technique, using more wire and producing a right angle weave.  It it possible to create intricate patterns and designs within the weave just from the placement of the wire.</p>
<p>An example:</p>
<p><img alt=""basketweave"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/lisagems/6128103/48887/48887_900.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Basketweave""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Even if the entire goal of this campaign in not reached, any funding received will go toward show registration and materials.  If I can get into that first show, LisaGems Jewelry Design has a chance.<br/><br/></p>

<p> </p></div>","I found jewelry making by accident
I took metalsmithing/jewelry design as an elective toward my degree in art in college. One time melting precious metal and I was hooked for life.  I've been making jewelry in one form or another for more than 20 years, from lost wax casting and fabrication, chain maille, beading, and then Art Clay Silver
Like many artists, I've worked a vast array of jobs while dreaming of the day I could actually support myself with my art.  I've been looking for a new form, new media to work in, something that could make the dream of supporting myself with my jewelry possible.  By using a old technique with new materials, I've created something different, new, and very exciting.



The wire weaving is also supported by Art Clay Silver work, and more traditional cast silver like the celtic knot pendent below.

Also with pearl and gem beaded jewelry.

 
How your contributions Help:
To move this from an 'after work' hobby to a sustainable business, I've written a business plan which include the development of a visual identity and website for LisaGems Jewelry Design, the registration of the business, purchase of materials and display, and an aggressive schedule of shows and sales visits to area boutiques.
There are many expenses related to the start up of a new business, but for a craft based business, perhaps the largest expense is the up-front cost of show registration.  The better the show the larger the registration cost.  The three primary shows I'm focused on are The Renegade Craft Fair in Chicago, Custer's Last Stand in Evanston, and the One of a Kind show in Chicago.  Each is a unique show.  Renegade brings artists from all over the country with a focus on a younger audience.  Custer's is an long established show with a large audience.  The One of a Kind Show is a high-end gift show that has been rated as one of the top 200 shows in the country.I am confident of my ability to win jury approval for each of these shows.  The woven wire bracelet line is unlike anything I seen in my research at any of these show, or at smaller local shows.  Your contributions will help cover the registration and table costs.
I am well on my way to having sufficient stock for the first of these shows, but it is time to restock the materials for making more, and also those to build a unique display unit designed to make it easy for the shopper to see the bracelets and to get the bracelet to try on.
What your help to me gets you!
Every contribution helps move this campain to its goal however small or large, and I am grateful for any assistance, but getting goodies for your help doesn't hurt.
For a $15 contribution, you'll receive a semi-precious gems stretchy bracelet. (random selection)  Each bracelet comes with a thank you card, explaining what the gemstone is and what it's properties are.

 
For $25 you'll receive a woven wire pendent. (random color selection)

 
For a $50 contribution, you'll receive a custom, four strand, 1 or 2 color woven bracelet.  Contributor may specify colors, and give wrist size for comfortable fit.  Available colors are:  magenta; red; orange; yellow; lime green; dark green; sapphire blue; purple; brown; black; and raw copper.

 
For $75, contributors will receive a custom, six strand, 2 or 3 color woven bracelet.  Contributor may specify colors, and give wrist size for comfortable fit.  Available colors are:  magenta; fuchsia; pink; red; orange; yellow; lime green; dark green; ice blue; peacock blue; sapphire blue; dark blue; lavender; purple; brown; amber; antique bronze; hematite; black; and raw copper.

 
At $100, contributors receive an eight color, 3 wire per color, woven bracelet in a rainbow.  Contributor may request frame and wrap colors, and provide wrist measurement for comfortable fit.
 
A contribution of $250 brings a bracelet woven in Sterling Silver or Sterling Silver and Gold-filled wire.  The more traditional version of this technique makes a lovely versatile accessory.

 
For the contributor who is able to give $500, I will make a bracelet with a technique I am still teaching myself, but will have mastered by the end of the month.  A The basket weave is a more difficult technique, using more wire and producing a right angle weave.  It it possible to create intricate patterns and designs within the weave just from the placement of the wire.
An example:

 
Even if the entire goal of this campaign in not reached, any funding received will go toward show registration and materials.  If I can get into that first show, LisaGems Jewelry Design has a chance.

<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>I'm Shilo McCabe, queer feminist photographer and during May 2011 I celebrated <a href=""http://magazine.goodvibes.com/2011/05/01/its-national-masturbation-month/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">National Masturbation Month</a> with daily sex positive photos of people masturbating and sharing personal stories that completed the phorase ""I masturbate..."" (hence the name of the project) This project came about because, while speaking on a sex-positive panel at Mills College I was asked if I had any tips for becoming more sex-positive.  Without hesitation I said ""Masturbate!"" Everyone laughed at my response and I realized later that I really had much more to say on the subject. </p>
<p><strong>What did I learn from doing this project?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Masturbation is a safe place to let go of self criticism.</strong><br/><a href=""http://thesexpositivephotoproject.blogspot.com/2011/05/i-masturbate-day-eleven.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Day 11:</a><span> ""</span><em>The pleasure and love I am showing my body helps keep my negative internal voices from being so harshly critical of the days actions and decisions.""</em><span>  </span><br/><br/><strong>It's powerful self care.</strong><br/><a href=""http://thesexpositivephotoproject.blogspot.com/2011/05/i-masturbate-day-eighteen.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Day 18:</a><span> </span><em>""Masturbation gives me some of my best orgasms.

<p>Reducing the stigma around masturbation is important because we are a culture of mixed messages - there is no unilateral message about masturbation, for some people there is a stigma about it, for others it is culturally accepted as a norm and even expected (as with heteronormative male, for example).

<p>The ""I masturbate..."" photo project was hugely popular online, bringing in over 250,000 hits to my <a href=""http://www.thesexpositivephotoproject.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">blog</a> for the month of May 2011, and now it is coming, live and in person, to The Center for Sex and Culture in San Francisco in May of 2013. Never before has such a radically inclusive exhibition of photos of people masturbating been put together and I need your help to make it happen. The exhibition will also include some new photos that were not in the original online collection. </p>

<p>I need to raise $5000 for a variety of production costs to make this show happen.</p>
<h3><strong>In addition, I am funding the production of a limited edition hardcover book to feature the entire ""I masturbate..."" project, as well as bonus images and essays.

<li>Photo Printing Costs = $750</li>
<li>Matting, Framing Costs = $1000</li>
<li>The Book = $2000 covers the cost of printing 50 copies of the book</li>
<li>Paying it Forward =  I will donate at least 5% of what I raise to the Center for Sex and Culture in San Francisco. Should I exceed my fundraising goal, I will donate up to 10% of my total! </li>
</ul>
<p>The balance of the funds cover the assorted costs of shipping perks to my sponsors as well as other varied expenses associated with putting a show like this together (promotional materials, sample books, advertising, reception costs, fundraising fees, etc.)</p>
<h3><strong>Stretch Goals:</strong></h3>

<p>I’m a dancer and choreographer living in Berlin, Germany. After completing an M.A. in choreography three years ago, I’ve done a lot of work and research with conscious erotic practices. Many of those experiences have been inspirational, transformative, and extremely beautiful.</p>
<p>My wish is to bring my worlds of art-making and healing together, and use tools I’ve developed in 10 years of making dances to create an art piece that is unlimited by ideas about what can and can’t be done in the realm of “serious” art.</p>
<p>I’d also like to change people’s ideas about how subtle, intelligent, and well-conceived erotic art can be. Despite films like Shortbus, and the groundbreaking work done by many queer and/or feminist artists, art that features any exploration of sensuality is still marginalized.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Hard Facts</strong></p>
<p>Berlin, Germany, besides being a dynamic and open-minded environment where people come to experiment artistically, has the advantage of still being one of the world’s more affordable cities. I’ve tried to keep production costs to a minimum, while still being able to work as professionally as possible. I feel that this project needs a certain production value in order to get its point across. I especially think that the performers involved, who are all passionate about the project, and bring years of professional dance experience to their work, should be paid fairly, especially since they are willing to really challenge their boundaries and explore new territory. This is how it breaks down:</p>
<p>5 performers for 8 days of rehearsal/research/shooting: € 4000</p>
<p>Cameraperson, editing, ca. 4 weeks of postproduction: € 2000</p>
<p>Musicians, soundtrack producer, studio rental: € 2000</p>
<p>Location rental for 8 days of shooting: € 1000</p>
<p>Equipment rental, costumes, props: € 1000</p>
<p>If we don’t reach our funding goal, we still plan to go ahead with the project. I will dip deeply into my savings and try to work something out, reduce the days of shooting, or pay off my debt to the cast &amp; crew over the course of the next year. My research so far, including the rehearsal weekend that appears in some scenes of the pitch video, has been entirely self-funded, but I need your help to make sure this project is made in the best possible quality! (without putting me into debt...)</p>
<p>In exchange for your contribution, You’ll receive unique and fantastic perks! Not to mention a chance to be on the right side of history as a supporter of this exciting project! Many of the perks involve needing to be in or near Berlin, but if You’re unable to travel there, and want to contribute anyway, message me! I love to travel, and we can most definitely work something out!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Artistic Team</strong></p>
<p>The dancers involved in the project are trained in various body-based practices such as performance art, bodywork, holotropic breathing, etc., that have healing as well as aesthetic qualities. This diverse set of skills will enable some truly revolutionary mash-ups which I intend to make accessible to others through the film.</p>

<h2><strong>Frequently Asked Questions:</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Indiegogo Questions</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Why Indiegogo?</strong></p>
<p>We believe that Indiegogo is an excellent way to promote and get feedback on our venture. Indiegogo can take us a step closer to assuring that we can easily connect with artists &amp; artisans and ship their undiscovered goods to every country in the world.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>General Questions</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Mission</strong></p>
<p>Artblix is connecting local artists &amp; artisans to the Global Market.  With Artblix we are helping local artists &amp; artisans to sell their handmade goods online. Starting with Guatemala and spreading the good vibe all around the world. </p>
<p>We believe we can change the lives of these undiscovered artists and artisans, and bring customers handmade products with authentic cultural backgrounds that they weren't able to find before.</p>
<p><strong>What's your inpiration for Artblix?</strong></p>
<p>Our inspiration is the many talented Artists &amp; Artisans in Guatemala who don’t have the resources or the time to sell their handmade goods online. These Artists &amp; Artisans create some of the most beautiful and unique handcrafts in the world, most of the time as their main source of income. However they are often times exploited for their work or they only sell their handcrafts locally to tourists that are lucky enough to find them.  We can change this! The Artblix team will change this by introducing their undiscovered products and their untold stories to the online market.</p>
<p><strong>How the idea began?</strong></p>
<p>The idea started by talking to tourists from the US who were visiting the handicraft markets in Guatemala. They were often amazed by the handmade products that they found for their uniqueness, rarity, and cultural background; goods you can’t find unless you are traveling inside Guatemala. It is cultural experience you can only get inside the country, and that is the same problem for many other countries around the world. Then the idea came: How do we bring these unique works of art and their creators not just to tourists, but to a global audience? That’s when we created Artblix.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite Thing About The Business</strong></p>
<p>Our favorite thing is definitely the change that we are making in the lives of all these artists &amp; artisans. Creating social value and improving these people lives is our everyday motivation to improve and be the best we can be.</p>
<p><strong>Most Recent Business Accomplishment</strong></p>
<p>Artblix is currently participating in the Babson College renowned Summer Venture Program; a program that has really set organization, structure, and realistic goals for the venture. <a href=""http://www.babson.edu/academics/centers/blank-center/venture-accelerator/summer-venture-program/pages/summer-venture-program.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.babson.edu/academics/centers/blank-center/venture-accelerator/summer-venture-program/pages/summer-venture-program.aspx</a></p>
<p><strong>How does Artblix make money?</strong>                 </p>
<p>Artblix is a Social Venture, so our objective is to solve social issues through a business approach while also generating income. Our objective is to have a positive impact in each of our artists and artisans; increase their source of income by using fair trade as a tool. It is not a non-profit or charity organization. Artblix only adds a 4% sales commission to the products that will be on sale on the website.</p>
<p><strong>When will the online platform be ready?</strong></p>
<p>We expect the online platform to be ready during October, 2013. The date is subject to change based on how we can accelerate the programming and development of the site.</p>
<p><strong>How does Artblix ensure the products will get to the purchaser?</strong></p>
<p>Artblix will have a local infrastructure in each country it operates (starting with Guatemala). Our infrastructure is based on a strong offline community of artists &amp; artisans recruiters. When an item is sold online, the recruiters will use the transferred funds to purchase the item from the artist or artisan, and mail it using the preferred shipping method. Once the item is shipped, a notification with tracking number will be sent to the customer.</p>
<p><strong>How does Artblix decide the price of the products and the shipping?</strong></p>
<p>Artblix does not participate in the pricing process. Our belief is that each artist or artisan has to name their own price and we respect their decisions. A 4% commission will be added to the price decided by the artist. The shipping is determined by the local post office and is based on international rules and tariffs.</p>
<p><strong>In which way you differ from Etsy.com?</strong></p>
<p>The main distinction is that Artblix has a strong offline component. The majority of local artists &amp; artisans in Guatemala and the world still don’t have access to the global online market. At Artblix we know that economical exclusion comes as a result of lack of opportunity. To sell on Etsy.com you have to speak English, you have to be tech savvy and you have to have a bank account. Artblix gives the opportunity to the less tech-savvy artisans from remote areas of the world to be a part of global economy, even if they don’t have bank account and can’t speak English. This ensures customers that they will find artworks that they were not able to find before, and that each of these artworks will have an authentic cultural background.</p>

<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">Hi everyone.  I am trying to start my own photography business.  I really have a passion for photography.  I have not had a lesson in my life so what you see is all self taught.  I think that understanding the technical side of the art side is something that is a definite so I am also wanting to take a class that will teach me why this does that.  Also, it will just help me be a better photographer.  I am running this campaign because I want to be successful in this field.  In the mean time, I take headshots to help save for the things I need for my business.  </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">My love for photography first started with my first born. I always had the camera in my hand.  Even after my third one, the love for it never stopped.  It was when my second child was born that I started venturing out to other avenues of photography.  My eldest child is a wonderful artist.  She can draw anything you put in front of her.  The name Drawn 2 You Photography came about by combining what she loved to do and what I loved to do.  I must say that over the years I have many collections that I cannot wait to share with others and that photography is still exciting to me. My camera goes everywhere with me because I never know when I am going to see something that will spark more creativity from me.  </span>
</h3>
<div>Presently, my camera lens is on the outs  and so is the computer that I use to help create art from my photos.  I want to be able to provide better quality photos and art.  By having this equipment that is necessary to have a successful photography business, I will be able to secure bigger jobs and be competitive in charging professional rates.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Without this equipment, my business will not be competitive with others in my area and will not produce the quality needed to remain in the photography business.  Go to my website, <a href=""http://drawn2you.zenfolio.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://drawn2you.zenfolio.com</a>, check out my Before and After 5 Series, the Perspective and Focus Series.....at the moment I am highlighting my headshots category.  I have so many more ideas bursting at the seams I can't wait to share them.  I can only do this with your help and support.  </div>
<div> </div>
<p>The approximate amount needed to fund this campaign will be $8,000.  The funds will help secure a new lens that is needed, a mac computer, printing and mounting of pictures onto canvas, framing, rental of gallery/booth, marketing and advertising.  <br/></p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>

</div></div>","Hi everyone.  I am trying to start my own photography business.  I really have a passion for photography.  I have not had a lesson in my life so what you see is all self taught.  I think that understanding the technical side of the art side is something that is a definite so I am also wanting to take a class that will teach me why this does that.  Also, it will just help me be a better photographer.  I am running this campaign because I want to be successful in this field.  In the mean time, I take headshots to help save for the things I need for my business.  My love for photography first started with my first born. I always had the camera in my hand.  Even after my third one, the love for it never stopped.  It was when my second child was born that I started venturing out to other avenues of photography.  My eldest child is a wonderful artist.  She can draw anything you put in front of her.  The name Drawn 2 You Photography came about by combining what she loved to do and what I loved to do.  I must say that over the years I have many collections that I cannot wait to share with others and that photography is still exciting to me. My camera goes everywhere with me because I never know when I am going to see something that will spark more creativity from me.  

Presently, my camera lens is on the outs  and so is the computer that I use to help create art from my photos.  I want to be able to provide better quality photos and art.  By having this equipment that is necessary to have a successful photography business, I will be able to secure bigger jobs and be competitive in charging professional rates.
 
Without this equipment, my business will not be competitive with others in my area and will not produce the quality needed to remain in the photography business.  Go to my website, http://drawn2you.zenfolio.com, check out my Before and After 5 Series, the Perspective and Focus Series.....at the moment I am highlighting my headshots category.  I have so many more ideas bursting at the seams I can't wait to share them.  I can only do this with your help and support.  
 
The approximate amount needed to fund this campaign will be $8,000.  The funds will help secure a new lens that is needed, a mac computer, printing and mounting of pictures onto canvas, framing, rental of gallery/booth, marketing and advertising.

<h3>About Me</h3>
     Hi, my name is Brittany! I'm 20 years old and I've wanted to be an artist for as long as I can remember. Due to lack of support and fears of job insecurity, I have been afraid to pursue my dream until recently. Over the last few months, I have bought several instructional books and have been attempting to teach myself how to draw from square one. However, I have found myself having difficulty grasping the concepts on my own and I have realized that to make anymore progress, I need one-on-one instruction with another person.</div>
<h3>The Purpose of My Campaign</h3>
<p>     Currently, I work part-time in a very small town, and without any college education, my employment opportunites are extremely limited. Why not go to college to study art? Well, I'm in a situation where I do not qualify for financial assistance from the government and I do not want to take out student loans at the moment. The parent I live with refuses to help me pay for a college education because they do not support it, believing that it's a waste of time and money.</p>
<p>     For a long time, I have known about <a href=""http://www.schoolism.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Schoolism</a>, a website founded by <a href=""http://www.imaginismstudios.com/ourArt.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bobby Chiu</a>, a well-known artist in the entertainment industry. Schoolism offers online art courses where professional human instructors provide personalized feedback to students as an alternative option to traditional college art courses. In September, Schoolism is offering a course covering the <a href=""http://www.schoolism.com/school.php?id=18"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fundamentals of Drawing</a>.</p>
<div>
<h3>Where the Money's Going</h3>
<p>     The Drawing Fundamentals course with personalized feedback costs $498 for six weeks of instruction. Between helping my parent with bills and buying food for myself on minimum wage, I am just unable to save the money required in such a short amount of time.</p>
<p>     I know taking this course will lay the foundation for achieving my dream of being a successful artist. I have the desire and motivation required to accomplish my goal, but without the proper ground work or funds beneath me, I am stuck. If I'm able to take part in this course, I will have accomplished the hardest part of the journey, which is learning the fundamentals.</p>
<p>     With your help, I can use the knowledge I gain from successfully completing the fundamentals course to open the door for commissions that could possibly fund further education at a traditional college. If you could help me raise at least half of the $500 goal, I may be able to make up the difference myself.</p>
</div>
<div>     If this campaign happens to exceed the goal of $500, all extra money will be given to the <a href=""http://www.childsplaycharity.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Child's Play Charity</a>, a charity that donates books, toys, and video games to children in hospitals.</div>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>     You may notice that my perks stop at a relatively low number. The reason for this is, I have not yet learned enough to offer any decent artwork as compensation for your generosity. I also want to emphasize the fact that if only 25 people donated $20, I would be able to reach my goal. $20 can be too much for some to spare, so there's also the option of smaller donation amounts, ranging from $1 to $15.</p>
<p>     The postcard included for the $10, $15 &amp; $20 amounts will feature a piece of abstract art that I created with my Bamboo Splash tablet.</p>
<p>     I have also created a Blogspot for the purpose of this campaign. If this actually gets any attention, I will record the names of everyone who donates to show my eternal appreciation.</p>
<h3>Can't Donate?</h3>
<div>No problem! You can still help me by spreading the word about my campaign on various social-networking sites. I would greatly appreciate any and all help towards taking the first step in achieving my dream. (:</div></span></div>","About Me

Incorporating Electronic Voice Phenomenon, ambient sound from these locations, sound bytes of music and spoken word recordings from past eras, and my own original music, I have found it very rewarding to create ""audio postcards"" from these deeply emotional and historic events.  <br/><br/>My very first composition is a track inspired by the ""thoughtography"" of Ted Serios, a Chicagoan who worked as a bellman at the Hilton Hotel in Chicago in the early 1960s ,who claimed he could imprint Polaroid film with images from his mind. Starting with recordings of Serios and parapsychologist Jule Eisenbud, who studied Ted for years, along with ambient recordings from the Hilton and the Palmer House, where Serios and Eisenbud met, as well as EVP recorded around the original camera and photographs housed in the special collections of the University of Maryland Baltimore County, I added recordings of a Polaroid camera in action, the shutter tripping and the film being ripped out, as well as ice tinkling in a glass (Ted always worked better drunk).  The base or background track is a manipulated version of ""Can't Buy Me Love,"" which was number one on the charts the week Serios and Eisenbud met.  My hope is that some of the excitement and mystery of Ted Serios, as well as his very ""Chicago"" story, are captured in this short track of about 2 minutes.  <br/><br/>This will be the first release of ""Purgatory Press,"" an institution creating music and books of a less narrative and more experiential variety than my traditional history books--and their more traditional publishers.  <br/><br/>It is my great hope that you will support me as I return to my roots as an aspiring artist and my first loves of expression through visual art, poetry and music.  My goal is to give other researchers, too, a channel through which to express their artistic impulses as paranormal investigators.  <br/><br/>I have planned about a dozen releases for the next two years, most of them 7"" flexible phonograph records with accompanying art and notes, which will include a link to an MP3 download.   Each 7"" release will cost about 500 dollars for a pressing of 250 copies.  My aim is to have enough supporters to fund several pressings, but even enough support for one would be a wonderful sign to me that I'm on the right track.<br/><br/>I've been writing and creating my entire life, have operated Chicago Hauntings Tours for 12 years, have hosted the Chicago Ghost Conference for 7 years with great success, and my website has been called ""one of the most important web sites for local history.""  I design everything myself, create and host many creative events every year to bring people together and share ideas about the paranormal in its many expressions, and I am determined, so determined.   Whatever I do works.  I believe it works because people find an outlet for their own beliefs, expressions and fears in the things I do.  Thank you for supporting my work these past two and a half decades!<br/><br/>-Ursula Bielski<br/>founder, Chicago Hauntings, Inc.<br/>

<h3>Why House prints?</h3>
<p>Hello, internet. My name is Tobias Gurl, and I'm a trans man with a short story to share.</p>
<p>Like I imagine many of you reading this did, I grew up reading J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter books  - acting out wizard duels on the playground, wading through fan fiction, agonizing over where I would have been sorted, etc. I wouldn't have expected the woman who wrote a how-to guide for resisting authoritarianism to have <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/12/21/why-cant-jk-rowling-accept-transgender-people-like-me/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">planted her stake on the side of transphobia</a>, but here we are.</p>
<p>Rowling's public platform has the potential to influence policy targeting trans people like me. Even if it doesn't go that far, having someone many of us looked up to turn on us still stings.</p>
<p>Stories, though, are bigger than their authors, and the inspirational symbolism Rowling created can be appreciated outside of her choices. I want to offer those of us who have been rejected art that gets at what we appreciated in the first place, and to use it as an opportunity to fight back against transphobia in a concrete, material way.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1577063615/bs9jiwgaa0so8a5tfcgl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Here's how it works:</h3>
<p>I want to make these prints <strong>free</strong> to trans people and anyone who donates to a transgender charity or nonprofit. (Or close to free - I can't afford to eat the cost of shipping.) Once the prints are off the press I'll be offering them on <a href=""https://www.tobiasgurl.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my website</a> and any future conventions where I'm a vendor. All you'll need to do is send me a screencap or photo of your proof of donation (minus credit card or other sensitive information) and I'll send you a promo code that will allow you to order on from your House for free. <strong>Additional prints will still come at a cost to the buyer, which is why I'm offering them at a discount as one of my tiers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please send me a private message to let me know which print(s) you want with your order, and with your commission request, if applicable.</strong></p>
<p>My local printer of choice, Girlie Press, charges $99 for 200 A7 quality 5x7 prints, which comes out to 50 per House. Including Indiegogo's 5% base fee, cost of gas, and a little rounding up, I'll need to raise $110 to print a modest-sized run. Additional funds raised will go toward increasing the quantity of prints, up to $500 total. Anything beyond that and I'll need to have a word with my printer about options like stickers, which can't happen until after the holidays. <strong>If you see the total reach or exceed $500, please consider gifting your money directly to a transgender charity, then sending me your receipt later so I can send you your free print.</strong></p>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Not many. If I don't raise the full amount I'm asking for, I'll just print as many as I can with what I do get. I've successfully completed two prior fundraisers, and have a proven track record on delivering my promises. As with all fan art, there's a small chance I'll be hit with a copyright takedown and will be unable to complete the fundraiser; if that should happen, your money will be refunded with an apology.</p>

<h3>How we got the idea for ArtLayer</h3>
<p><strong>It started with one layer at a time!</strong></p>
<p>In 2018 we set on a mission to explain to everyone how a 3D printer works.</p>
<p>After coming up with several models layered for the real world, we realised that the entire process of building a 3D model from physical layers can turn into an engaging and rewarding activity for kids and big kids alike.</p>
<div> </div>
<p> </p>
<p>While in the process of experimenting with various pieces, we realised it has the potential to be a lot more than just stacking up 3D models:</p>
<p><strong>It’s art | It can be a puzzle | It’s mentally stimulating | It’s a way of relaxation</strong></p>
<p><strong>It’s rewarding | It’s an education tool | It’s a decorative piece</strong></p>
<p>Not long after, we started coming up with our art innovative collection.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1610044214/vsuicgamtotboljrw6yv.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>The Brand behind ArtLayer</h3>
<p>We’re called Daisy Sign, and we’re the makers of ArtLayer.</p>
<p>Our history goes way back in 2003, with a small advertisement shop where we produced unusual promotional items for advertising purposes.</p>
<p>Since then, we have worked on a variety of original, non-conventional products  made of both wood and cardboard.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1610044255/vgpldjetdnwd9liyp0hx.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>With time, we realized that this is our call, that this is what we want to do - play with wood and cardboard and create something new, and fun, and even artistic.</p>
<p>Something children and adults will enjoy in the real word - away from screens.</p>
<p>We also understood the fulfillment of making something with your own hands, that’s why we try to come with simple and engaging ways to connect with people.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1610044286/u4gx8kj1khe0lnvg83kz.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In 2018 we decided to create ArtLayer – to give children and adults a way to make their own unconventional art pieces.</p>
<p><strong>Something real. Something you can build yourself.</strong></p>
<p>Through ArtLayer, we try to remind everyone of the satisfaction of building something with your own hands.</p>
<p>At this moment we have experimented and created 30 types of designs that offer several levels of complexity to engage children, as well as adults.</p>
<p>And we’re not stopping here. That’s why we created this Kickstarter.</p>
<p>To fund our campaign and create more designs and innovative concepts.</p>

That’s why we decided to extend ArtLayer even further, and create more elaborate pieces that will be engaging and mentally stimulating for adults as well.
Stack layer after layer and let the stress fade away. In the end you’ll feel rewarded and proud that you’ve achieved something with your own hands.
 
Handcrafted art for your display – with you as the artist!
ArtLayer: a way to take creativity to the real world
Not only a relaxing activity, but also a rewarding experience.

How it’s made
Using laser cutting technology, all ArtLayer puzzles come with pre-cut cardboards that require no special tools or skills for assembly.
 
Everything you need comes in the box - even easy to understand instructions in case you get stuck.
Everything will be manufactured in our own production facilities
All ArtLayer items - including the handcrafted box - are produced in Ukraine, Europe.
This way, you’ll have the guarantee of a speedy delivery, and that you’ll get what you pledge for – without flaws, without delays, and without intermediaries.

How we got the idea for ArtLayer
It started with one layer at a time!
In 2018 we set on a mission to explain to everyone how a 3D printer works.
After coming up with several models layered for the real world, we realised that the entire process of building a 3D model from physical layers can turn into an engaging and rewarding activity for kids and big kids alike.
 
 
While in the process of experimenting with various pieces, we realised it has the potential to be a lot more than just stacking up 3D models:
It’s art | It can be a puzzle | It’s mentally stimulating | It’s a way of relaxation
It’s rewarding | It’s an education tool | It’s a decorative piece
Not long after, we started coming up with our art innovative collection.

The Brand behind ArtLayer
We’re called Daisy Sign, and we’re the makers of ArtLayer.
Our history goes way back in 2003, with a small advertisement shop where we produced unusual promotional items for advertising purposes.
Since then, we have worked on a variety of original, non-conventional products  made of both wood and cardboard.

With time, we realized that this is our call, that this is what we want to do - play with wood and cardboard and create something new, and fun, and even artistic.
Something children and adults will enjoy in the real word - away from screens.
We also understood the fulfillment of making something with your own hands, that’s why we try to come with simple and engaging ways to connect with people.

In 2018 we decided to create ArtLayer – to give children and adults a way to make their own unconventional art pieces.
Something real. Something you can build yourself.
Through ArtLayer, we try to remind everyone of the satisfaction of building something with your own hands.
At this moment we have experimented and created 30 types of designs that offer several levels of complexity to engage children, as well as adults.
And we’re not stopping here. That’s why we created this Kickstarter.
To fund our campaign and create more designs and innovative concepts.

<strong>The Artwork</strong> </div></div><p>Years ago, I literally dreamt of an art project. <i>1:23</i> came to me fully formed, with all of its details, in one striking image.

I asked each volunteer to bring an object that both embodies a side of his personality and acts as a prop for his penis. Initially I wondered if anyone would reply. Who knew that men would love the idea and sign-up in droves? Five of the initial images in the series are above. When completed <i>1:23</i> will be an immersive, visual representation of the dating world for women who date men.

Lynda is a self taught artist specialising in acrylics. Most of her works are commission pieces where she is entrusted to portray peoples much loved pets. Born in Ipswich, Australia, Lynda has always had a love of art. From the very first time she was able to hold a pencil she was experimenting with techniques and has won several awards during her journey. Lynda spent many years living on a remote water pumping station in Central Queensland. Often cut off from neighbours and the town by floodwaters gave her time to study her vast environment. “Living such an isolated lifestyle made me really see and feel the colours, light and movement around me. This experience has enabled me to portray my subjects in a way that often surprise but engage the viewer.” In a world of conflict Lynda makes art that makes people smile. “In my dreams I am swimming in bold colours. They don’t blend but stay pure and clean. I breathe them, I feel them and I live them. Colour is my passion.”</p><p style=""margin-left:27pt;""> </p><div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/PTxqSw6Qpic?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><div style=""text-align: center;""> </div><p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lyndafaulknerart/?hl=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1583611710/ajqcrja3cxejkzkhgta8.jpg"" src=""""/></a></p><p> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Claudia, Jorge &amp; Jager</h2><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1582789955/epncexiwhgjtzm25ebzi.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""margin-left:27pt;""> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581430254/fx7nsvhhzkawv5nnvdt1.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1583816055/z6wost2wr4xw14edo2qu.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1582787576/epr4fm5iepftgfozoi99.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>·         Design: The cards are beautifully crafted and include all the members of the @DogsAlliance in the royal cards, aces and jokers!</p><p>·         Quality: We are working with the best card manufacturer to make sure these cards last forever!

If you are asking why 13 dogs and one cat the reason is that we needed a Joker to rule them all!  We have been selling decks of cards and donating part of the revenues to the Hong Kong Dog Rescue Shelter (HKDRS). This time, our help will go to support the job of WIRES in Australia after the terrible bush fires that have been happening in the last months.                                               Now join us and get your cards, have a laugh with your family and friends and use them as a gift that will always draw a smile :)   In the last months, Australia has been suffering one of the worst sets of bushfires in its history devastating thousands of hectares.  Many animals were already struggling with a lack of water and food due to a terrible drought. With the fires destroying unprecedented amounts of habitat, food shortages have increased and lack of suitable habitat will be a significant long-term challenge for surviving wildlife.It is impossible to know how many animals have died but rough estimations say that over 1 billion since September.  Not all heroes wear a cap WIRES (NSW Wildlife Information, Rescue and Education Service Inc.) has been rescuing and caring for wildlife for over 30 years and is the largest wildlife rescue organization in Australia. WIRES mission is to actively rehabilitate and preserve Australian wildlife and inspire others to do the same. They are passionate about supporting smaller volunteer organizations in the wildlife sector with the same mission, as well as Universities, Veterinary Associations and other leading scientific and environmental groups. In the last 5 years WIRES has been working with organizations including WWF, National Parks Association, Humane Society International, The Wilderness Society, Nature Conservation Council, Birdlife, RSPCA, Animal Welfare League and IFAW and we thank these organizations for their significant ongoing contribution to the wildlife rehabilitation sector.In response to the tragic toll of the catastrophic fires and drought on wildlife, WIRES is actively pursuing significant opportunities to help wildlife more broadly across Australia, including partnering on projects to improve long-term outcomes for native animals. Photo credit: WIRES The @DogsAlliance has come up with a plan to support WIRES in their job. And guess what? We need you!We have developed a beautiful limited edition playing cards deck with all the members of the @DogsAlliance specially painted by Australian artist Lynda Faulkner.  We will be donating a percentage of each sale of this campaign to WIRES in order to help with our grain of sand in this catastrophe. The amount (percentage) to be donated will escalate as we get more sales. With this, our stretch goals are linked to a bigger percentage of the sale that goes to the final donation. Stretch goals: ·         If between 200 - 499 packs of cards are sold then we can fund and donate 25% of all sales to WIRES.·         If between 500 and 999 packs of cards are sold then 27,5% of all sales will be donated to WIRES.·         If between 1.000 and 2.499 packs of cards are sold then 30% of all sales will be donated to WIRES.·         If between 2.500 and 9.999 packs of cards are sold then 32,5% of all sales will be donated to WIRES.·         If more than 10.000 packs of cards are sold then 35% of all sales will be donated to WIRES.     Lynda Faulkner ·         Lynda FaulknerArt, travel and nature are three of Lynda’s favourite things. Lynda is a self taught artist specialising in acrylics. Most of her works are commission pieces where she is entrusted to portray peoples much loved pets. Born in Ipswich, Australia, Lynda has always had a love of art. From the very first time she was able to hold a pencil she was experimenting with techniques and has won several awards during her journey. Lynda spent many years living on a remote water pumping station in Central Queensland. Often cut off from neighbours and the town by floodwaters gave her time to study her vast environment. “Living such an isolated lifestyle made me really see and feel the colours, light and movement around me. This experience has enabled me to portray my subjects in a way that often surprise but engage the viewer.” In a world of conflict Lynda makes art that makes people smile. “In my dreams I am swimming in bold colours. They don’t blend but stay pure and clean. I breathe them, I feel them and I live them. Colour is my passion.”   Claudia, Jorge & Jager     ·         Design: The cards are beautifully crafted and include all the members of the @DogsAlliance in the royal cards, aces and jokers!·         Quality: We are working with the best card manufacturer to make sure these cards last forever! The cards are plastic, waterproof and durable... It doesn't matter how messy the playing gets!      We can’t thank you enough for your help here. Please make sure to share this campaign with your friends and family and let's put together this small grain of sand while we enjoy a good laugh with the @DogsAlliance!",31.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Metka Krašovec and former students, a bridge between Slovene cultural legacy and contemporary artistic creation </h3>
<p>The most recent large-scale exhibition in KIBLA PORTAL in Maribor, entitled Presences, which laid bare the artistic incubation of several generational and individual directions that were formed under the guidance and mentorship of Professor Metka Krašovec, has filled the industrial space of KIBLA PORTAL with a strong connective effect, interweaving the selected works in a mutually communicative fashion, as the open configuration of the exhibition space itself unveiled the presence of kindred, yet at the same time entirely different approaches to painting, drawing, animation and sculpture. The quality of the artworks has merged with the quality of the space into a single, unified whole.  </p>
<p>In the six years of intense activity in the largest Slovene contemporary exhibition venue KIBLA PORTAL, which offers over 2000 square meters of space under one roof, we have – under unenviable financial conditions, with individual and collective efforts, with maximum resourcefulness and plenty of precarious and voluntary work – created cutting-edge national and international projects. The funding of the largest exhibition space in Slovenia thus depends on the enthusiasm of a handful of persons from ACE KIBLA and on successfully applying our projects to (various) EU programmes.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>We are collecting 15.000 USD </strong>for specialised art catalogue, designed and produced in situ. Since Metka Krašovec is one of Slovenia's most renown painters, and since she passed away just after the exhibition Presences was opened in Maribor, we feel it is our sole duty and big responsibility to provide not only visitors but also collaborating artists and experts with full-color, hard cover exhibition catalogue with all accompanying texts and professional photographs (done by Damjan Švarc). Catalogue will consist of 141 pages and will include over 100 photos from the exhibition Presences.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>We are only offering one perk</strong>, but this one is trully magnificent. We offer (for selling price of 29 USD + shipping) a unique art experience in the form of hard cover art catalogue from Presences exhibition (exhibition webpage) with over 100 high quality photographs presenting artworks by 32 artists, including Presences series (exhibited after very long period in it's entirety) by Metka Krašovec and all exhibited works by her former students, today also renown Slovenian painters and sculpturers.</p></li>
<li><p>Any funds we raise - this is also the reason why we decided to collect raised sum even if we don't succeed with full amount, will go for the production of mentioned Presences catalogue. If we don't raise full sum, we will provide the missing funds by other means, because it is our mission to publish this art catalogue no matter what. :)</p></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul><li>
<strong>The exhibition PRESENCES at KIBLA PORTAL</strong> was the ultimate creative act by one of the greatest Slovene painters, Metka Krašovec, and though nationally based in its concept, it has proven as the proper initiative and the right kind of opportunity that could easily be measured within a wider European, if not global scope. This Slovene project, then, was created with the friendly support of all participating artists and the following: Equrna Gallery, private collections of Metka and Dušan Uršič, Marko Koršič, Arne Brejc, David Rjazancev, Andrej Čeč (IC Dom real estate), Novak Antiquities, Riko company, Factor bank (Bank Assets Management Company), NLB d.d., Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, digital archives of the Museum of Modern Art Ljubljana and RTV Slovenija archives, Academy of Fine Arts and Design Ljubljana, Okvirji Zevnik d.o.o. (picture framing), Municipality of Maribor (partial co-financing of the catalog), Mides d. o. o. (Nada Jaklič Košir, sponsorship), and ACE KIBLA. </li></ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>KIBLA PORTAL opened its doors in 2012 as a partial outlet of the European Capital of Culture– Maribor and partner cities (EPK 2012)</strong>, more specifically, with the international interdisciplinary exhibition Soft Control: Art, Science and the Technological Unconscious, which was part of an extensive European collaboration project bearing the same title. For six years, KIBLA PORTAL has served as an arena for festivals (KIBLIX, MED) and large-scale art exhibitions produced by the Association for Culture and Education KIBLA; between three and four large-scale events of national and international importance are created here each year. This actively operating space is the only new and sustainable cultural project that persists, with a high-quality program, in the city of Maribor following EPK 2012.  </p>
<p>Among the most notable events in an ambitiously planned program were Materiality, which was organized and executed in collaboration with partners from Poland and Portugal, followed by Don't Be Afraid, You Are the Best, an exhibition of murals by artist and professor Petra Varl and selected artists, students of art education from the Faculty of Education, and later by the contemporary, Eastern-Europe-oriented exhibition Mundus Vadit Retro. In collaboration with the Museum of Contemporary Art Vojvodina from Novi Sad, we organized Memory of Violence – Dreams of the Future. Hungarian artist Gyula Várnai was presented through a retrospective of his works in 2015, and Matjaž Krivic with a photographic exhibition. In 2017 Macedonian sculptor Žarko Bašeski's works were on display, and later that same year works by Australian sculptor and interdisciplinary artist Patricia Piccinini. The exhibition venue also hosts four large-scale international interdisciplinary art shows, which are carried out as part of the project Risk Change: MIG 21 – Migratory Interdisciplinary Grid, Shelters of Babylon, and the upcoming Personal(2018) and Future World Atlas (2019).   </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are the CORE team representing the Utah Region for the 2013 Burning Man Festival. After taking the bodacious Bee Goddess out to the playa last year, we are excited to bring the PsycheDelicate Arch in 2013!</p>
<p>Our team brings the PsycheDelicate Arch as a beautiful offering to the Earth, and as an altar to be decorated with petroglyph-inspired images, portraits of superior beings from the stars and from other dimensions. We offer our good spirits and merriment to encourage these visitors to return.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need funds for lumber and other building materials and to help with costs of getting the Arch out to the Black Rock Desert. We can work wonders with a shoestring budget (although we always like more) and we are very capable of using funds to their fullest potential. We appreciate any and every donation to help us with these goals!</p>
<p>We're excited to offer the following gifts to our wonderful donors:</p>
<p>$5 donation – a handcrafted petroglyph alien pin (and our thanks!)</p>
<p>$10 donation - embroidered Utah 2013 CORE patch (and our thanks!)</p>
<p>$20 donation - Utah 2013 CORE t-shirt (and our thanks!)</p>
<p>For donations of any larger size, you will receive a handcrafted pin and either a patch or a tee (whichever you'd like) and of course a huge thank you from everyone who's been working hard on the project.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Delicate Arch is one of the most recognizable of Utah's many natural wonders: an uncanny span of rock rising from a bare massif, it looks as if it were created for a purpose, not eroded into shape by mere chance. This archway begs the question -- is it a simple result of erosion, or perhaps a portal to other worlds? In the many canyons of Utah's deserts are petroglyphs showing round-headed alien figures. Many speculate that our wild places have been visited for eons by the denizens of other worlds, and sightings of UFOs are common. People have always sought to tempt the visitors back; in ancient times canyon residents created that same rock art to honor them.</p>
<p>Incorporating art inspired by these petroglyphs, and maybe even some aliens, the PsycheDelicate Arch brings the history of the past as well as the mystery of the future directly to participants. Curious visitors can climb up to the top observatory deck for panoramic playa viewing or cross through the natural portal created by the Arch itself!</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We love volunteers! Please feel free to come down and help make this project a reality. The workspace is in Sugarhouse at 550 East 2225 South.  Bring your work gloves, all those paper bags you've been saving, and a smile!</p>
<p>Also, please request PAPER GROCERY BAGS the next time you are at the store and SAVE THEM for us. We'll be using them to skin the entire PsycheDelicate Arch so we'll need a bunch!</p>

A big giant THANK YOU to those who contributed to Art Break Day!  Your contributions, combined with our Art Angel (who matched every donation we received during the last 2 days of our campaign) and an art supply grant from the foundation Art4Moore are the reason Art Break Day will be happening this year.
YAY!
You can still contribute to Art Break Day HERE. 
--------------------------------------------------------
THE WHAT:
Art Break Day occurs annually on the first Friday of September.
It is the day we make art free.

What's an ART BREAK?
Think of a coffee break, just add some paint and brushes!
And, why should I take one?
We celebrate Art Break Day each year as a way to promote the positive impact art has in our lives and push the idea that it needs to be interwoven into the fabric of our daily lives.
Art Break Day not only benefits the individual by giving those who do not have access to art the tools they need to discover its benefit, it gets strangers to break bread with one another across a table filled with endless creativity and expressive possibilities. 


THE WHO:


“Everyone is an artist.”
 - Joseph Beuys
 
“Art is for everyone.”
 - Art is Moving

We’re not kidding.  Art Break Day exists because we believe everyone needs and benefits from the act of making art.

THE WHY:
Everyone needs art...

It makes people happy
It makes the world a better place
It’s a form of communication
It helps us get to know ourselves
It helps us get to know our ancestors
It helps us tell our stories to future generations
It connects us with our community

 and NOT everyone has access to it.


 3.9 Million Elementary Students in the United States have no access to Art Classes (source)

The above statistic is only talking about children.  Think about how many teens, adults and elders go without access to the arts.

Making art together creates positive change through artistic expression, social dialogue, and community engagement.

Everyone needs a break.
Life is manic.  Studies have shown that taking a break, “a little oasis of personal time,” from the daily grind does wonders for you. It increases your productivity, puts you in an overall better mood, and it lowers your stress level.
THE WHERE:
This year we have 13 locations across the world!
We need to send a HUGE BOX of awesome art supplies (paint, paint brushes, pencils, paper, markers, pastels, etc.) to each of our amazing Artists in Residence so they can let their community make art together.

I’ve spent the last 6 years making nonsensical monsters in both plush toy and puppet form, and I’ve run my own freelance Video and Graphic Design business for nearly 10 years now. In my recent MFA study I’ve had the opportunity to start exploring much bigger projects that bring all my interests and skills together into a unified installation practice. Lately I’ve been working on developing work that doesn’t naturally fall into what you typically see in a gallery space. This installation is very much about that; looking at the pop-culture space of the Theme Park, telling stories, letting people play. I'm turning the “space for quiet reflection” into “a space to let the imagination run wild.” Its also just the starting point for exploring Arboria: I already have new ideas for other projects using this setting, and I’m not talking about other gallery exhibitions. </span></p>

Hi I’m Nate Little, I’m an Artist, Designer, Toymaker, and part-time Mad Scientist. I actually do a lot of other things too, but your eyes would bleed if I tried to make you read the full list. I’m a fourth semester MFA Candidate at Claremont Graduate University, My MFA Thesis Show, called “(working title)” opens in early November. For this show I’m developing a “theme-park inspired” interactive, exploratory environment in the gallery space, “re-thinking the white box” as it were. The show will be comprised of a wide array of diffrent materials/media forms and techniques to help produce a more immersive experience. When you step through the galley doors, you step into the majestic land of Arboria: a somewhat familiar, but also strange world populated by all kinds of whimsical creatures.
Wait, you’re calling your show (working title)? Seriously? 
You bet I am, using the term “working title” and its origins as a way to move forward with a project even when it doesn’t have a set, marketable, name seems to strangely fit the way I approach my art practice. My work is constantly evolving and taking on new aspects: everything is an experiment and/or a work in progress, the only reason I ever call things “finished” is because I have a show date set, or a deadline for a commission. 
 
Also, I couldn’t come up with a ridiculous enough puns or bizarre enough sounding names that make the project seem more pretentious than it really is.
 
As this particular project has evolved, its proven to be an enromous undertaking: becoming more complex and sadly, more expensive. That’s where you come in:
The things I need, but ran out of funds for...  
I’m hoping to get about two thousand ($2,000) dollars to cover late-production expenses like Specialty lighting, AV equipment (like speakers and additional projectors),  set-dressing materials (from stuff to go inside the treehouse to things to help disguise my walls), and other things that really can’t be put together/used until very close to or during install of the show. Its also a way for me to actually give back to my closely-knit team of collaborators (shout out to my fellow Dream-Finders!) who are helping me tackle aspects of this show that I literally cannot do on my own. 
 
This is a Partial Funding Campaign: even if this project doesn’t reach my goal, I’ll still be able to put whatever is pledged into the project. We’re talking about my MFA Thesis show, it is going to happen either way, I’m asking you to help me make it the best I can. 
 
I’ll post stretch goals if we get close to meeting my goal before the campaign ends. For the most part it just means more cool stuff for you guys, and I’ll get to further improve the quality of this multimedia installation. 
Speaking of you getting cool stuff:
I have a ton of rad perks for this project: 
Click here for the Perks Video!
At the lower levels I have some cool things specifically for my financially-challenged backers
 

$1: Gives you access to download the Arboria Tourism Board Digital Wallpaper Pack, this is included at all backer levels. 


$5: Get on the mailing list for my actual Show Postcard, anyone who backs the project at a higher level also gets on the postcard mailing list. 

 
Since I’m a Plush Toymaker, and a pretty good one at that, I have a bunch of levels that feature my Nonsense Monsters Plush Toys as rewards, every one is handmade by me. No two will be the same.Most of these perks will be delivered well after this year’s holiday season (more likely sometime in early 2013), if you back early and at a higher level, a chance to snag one of my limited commission slots for this holiday season:

$25 Gets you a one-of-a-kind VooDoo Dude, Handmade by me. No two are the same, ever, shipped to you sometime around early 2013.


$55 Lets you Pre-Order a unique variation (no two will even use the same colored socks, much less look exactly the same) of one of my more popular Plush Designs, they are: Ashurbanipal, D-wayne, Slap-beast, Chunkasaur, Toe Lion, Toenoceros or Turtlebug. Shipped to you sometime around early 2013. 


$65: Adopt your very own baby “Greater Maned Sky Serpent” a new monster developed for this show, included will be an adoption form from the Arboria Forestry Department. Shipped to you sometime around early 2013.



$75: Lets you reserve a Commission slot for a custom monster of your request (within reason, We’ll talk via e-mail) to be produced and shipped to you sometime around early 2013. You can check my plush archive on my facebook for examples. 


$100: Lets you reserve a Commission slot for the 2012 holiday season, I’ll contact you via E-mail and we’ll discuss what you’d like and the deadline you’ll need your custom monster delivered by. You can check my plush archive on my facebook for examples.

By the way: I’m also in a book as a featured designer:

$45: Gets you a signed copy (by me, not the author) of “The Return of The Stupid Sock Creatures,” Which features my character Ashurbanipal. 
 

$75: Gets you a signed copy (by me, not the author) of “The Return of The Stupid Sock Creatures,” and a plush of my featured character: Ashurbanipal, handmade by me, naturally.  

Although I doubt anyone will back at this level, I have some premium rewards for anyone who really really really wants to support my show:


$500: You’ll get your choice of a Puppet in the style of one of the characters featured in this show plus a popular monster or baby sky serpent, and a signed copy of Return of stupid creatures. Shipped to you sometime around early 2013.


$800: I’ll make a handmade one of a kind “muppet style” Puppet of you, plus give you a Holiday Commission Slot, a signed copy of The Return of The Stupid Sock Creatures and a VooDoo Dude. The commission and other stuff will show up by the 2012 holiday season. The puppet will be shipped to you sometime around early 2013.

I’m also making a few Add-Ons available, anyone who backs at any level can add them to their pledge: 


+ 10 for a special “Arboria Tourism Board” mailable postcard pack: 4(maybe more!) uniquely designed limited run postcards, that you can keep for yourself or mail to your friends.


+ 25 Add a VooDoo dude to your order *delivered in early 2013


+ 55 Add a Popular creature *delivered in early 2013



*for commission reserves only* + 60 Add a second Commissioned creature (Limit 1 additional commission per order, this includes holiday rush)

*Note, all my Perk Levels are set with shipping included for backers in the US, international backers will need to add an additional $10-15 depending on perk level. I think that pretty much covers it:
Now, I realize this is a really short-run for a campaign, but I’ll need this funding to show up at least 2 weeks before the install date of my show, which is the weekend of November 10th-11th. And according to IndieGoGo’s system the only way to make sure that it happens is to end this campaign on October 12th. I hope to produce the best quality project I can, and I’m going to be thankful for every cent that comes in.
 
As the project continues I’ll be posting production update Vlogs to my Youtube Account, and other updates on the Mad Artisan Labs Facebook Page. And hopefully, quite a few of you will get to make it to the actual show, too! 
 
I really look forward to letting people see Arboria come to life. I’ve spent the last 6 years making nonsensical monsters in both plush toy and puppet form, and I’ve run my own freelance Video and Graphic Design business for nearly 10 years now. In my recent MFA study I’ve had the opportunity to start exploring much bigger projects that bring all my interests and skills together into a unified installation practice. Lately I’ve been working on developing work that doesn’t naturally fall into what you typically see in a gallery space. This installation is very much about that; looking at the pop-culture space of the Theme Park, telling stories, letting people play. I'm turning the “space for quiet reflection” into “a space to let the imagination run wild.” Its also just the starting point for exploring Arboria: I already have new ideas for other projects using this setting, and I’m not talking about other gallery exhibitions. 
 Help Spread the word:
Like I mentioned before, this is a relatively short run for a Campaign, but its the only way for me to get my funds in time for them to actually help. So I’m going to need you to help spread the word. Tell your friends and family! Link people to this Campaign! And keep a close watch on my FB and Youtube. I can’t wait to see what comes from this!  
 
The future is bright. Fortunately, I have goggles.

IL CONTESTO
In Afghanistan non ci sono solo guerre e violenza, c'è una cultura ricca e complessa che media e telegiornali sembrano ignorare. Ci sono artisti, artigiani,designer, musicisti che giorno dopo giorno cercano di preservare un senso di normalità tale da consentire l'espressione della propria creatività. The Little Book of Kabul è il progetto di un libro che vuole rivelare questo volto nascosto della città. Un libro di istanti, di parole e immagini che vuole raccontare Kabul da una prospettiva diversa. 
 
IL LIBRO
Dopo averci pensato a lungo, abbiamo deciso di lavorare in pellicola: fotografie in bianco e nero di piccolo e medio formato. L'ispirazione viene da disegni e schizzi a matita e inchiostro, tanto per le foto che per i testi: non un lungo saggio, ma una raccolta di istantanee, di dettagli e piccoli ritratti che ricostruiscono il complesso collage della vita quotidiana della Kabul creativa. 
 
IL PUNTO DI VISTA
The Little Book of Kabul guarda al futuro, alla transizione del 2014. C'è un grande interesse internazionale per le questioni legate ai giovani, all'arte e alla cultura, ma in pochi si interrogano sulla sostenibilità di lungo periodo degli investimenti stranieri in questo settore. Il nostro interesse è quello di costruire una prospettiva critica che guardi al di là dei circoli internazionali. La domanda principale che il libro si pone è legata al poi, a ciò che resterà dopo il 2014 e a quale possa essere il ruolo della produzione culturale in questa fase di cambiamento politico. 
 
SEGUIRE GLI ARTISTI
Per rispondere a queste domande, in The Little Book of Kabul seguiamo una serie di artisti che vivono a Kabul, passiamo del tempo con loro, ci facciamo raccontare delle storie, che vogliamo ricostruire attraverso piccoli ritratti e frammenti poetici. 
 
IL TUO SOSTEGNO
Siamo entusiasti di questo progetto e finora abbiamo ricevuto tanto incoraggiamento e sostegno. Ora abbiamo solo bisogno di un po' di solidità finanziaria per continuare la ricerca: lavorare a Kabul è molto costoso e al momento il nostro progetto è completamente autofinanziato.

<h3>'For The Time Being' is a one-day pop-up project bringing NYC-based creatives together to produce a zine and gallery show at Bishop Gallery in Brooklyn, NY. </h3>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>The Goal:</h3> <p>The pop-up gallery show will be curated by Mathea Millman, a Brooklyn-based curator and art director currently working as a Photo Assistant at Allure Magazine. The goal of the project is to bring creatives together to concept, create, and produce a zine and a gallery show in one day. The artists involved are professionals working around NYC in a variety of industries who will work together in an innovative and collaborative way. </p>

<div>The day of the gallery show the group of selected artists will collaborate, edit and produce content for the zine and gallery show. Everything will be made the day-of and will culminate in an event open to the public from 7-10pm at the <a href=""http://www.bishoponbedford.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bishop Gallery </a>located at 916 Bedford Ave in Brooklyn, NY. Feel free to check out their <a href=""http://www.bishoponbedford.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a>. The gallery is located near the Bedford-Nostrand G train. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>Why Are We Doing This?</h3>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">In the digital age everyone can find a community online. This project explores the concept of community as a departure from our evolving technological idea of community. It is about coming together as a physical community in order to understand our own individual presence in relation to something larger than ourselves, and to facilitate spontaneous collaboration with a specific time restraint. </span></div>

</div> <p><br/></p><p>Photo by Richard Perez</p></div>","'For The Time Being' is a one-day pop-up project bringing NYC-based creatives together to produce a zine and gallery show at Bishop Gallery in Brooklyn, NY. 

The Goal: The pop-up gallery show will be curated by Mathea Millman, a Brooklyn-based curator and art director currently working as a Photo Assistant at Allure Magazine. The goal of the project is to bring creatives together to concept, create, and produce a zine and a gallery show in one day. The artists involved are professionals working around NYC in a variety of industries who will work together in an innovative and collaborative way. 

The Gallery Show - Saturday, November 15th 2014:
The day of the gallery show the group of selected artists will collaborate, edit and produce content for the zine and gallery show. Everything will be made the day-of and will culminate in an event open to the public from 7-10pm at the Bishop Gallery located at 916 Bedford Ave in Brooklyn, NY. Feel free to check out their website. The gallery is located near the Bedford-Nostrand G train. 

Why Are We Doing This?
In the digital age everyone can find a community online. This project explores the concept of community as a departure from our evolving technological idea of community. It is about coming together as a physical community in order to understand our own individual presence in relation to something larger than ourselves, and to facilitate spontaneous collaboration with a specific time restraint.

Ally Lindsay - Fashion Photographer/Painter

<p>I have been making pots for 25 years.  As a creator and  builder the utility of an object resonates.  This passion has built Mill Creek Pottery, a full time studio with three wood fired kilns, and two apprentices.   We make work, we build and teach, and fail and learn.   What we learn here has ripples in the community.  My apprentices and I write, travel, and teach.  Recently we built two kilns for the China Academy of the Arts in Hangzhou, bringing Asian technology that has incubated and changed in the US back to Asia.</p>
<h2>The Campaign</h2>
<div>Mill Creek Pottery has been in Gresham, Wisconsin for 16 years.  Over that time we have seen the arts community in the area grow, and we have made many friends.   So many wonderful people have come to fire, buy pottery, visit, work and contribute in their own way.   We are at a time when we need some major maintenance and re-building of our kilns.  We need some new tools, bricks, a brick saw, and a large bisque kiln.   We are re-building the front of the anagama and the cross draft kiln from the ground up.</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I realize more than ever that the work I make is dependent of the efforts of many; my family, friends, apprentices, and the many wonderful customers I have met over the years.   I am asking you to consider joining us.</span></div>

Hello,
I'm Tina Guay. I am building a community darkroom at Engine, a nonprofit arts organization
in downtown Biddeford, Maine.</p>
<p>
In
the 5<sup>th </sup>grade I had the opportunity to shoot a
couple rolls of black and white film in a family friends studio. I
was able see how the film was processed to create beautiful images.
This experience inspired me to pursue this art form through high
school and college. I still remember the curiosity I experienced upon
developing and printing my first images.</p>
<p>
I
continued that pursuit of curiosity through my education at the New
Hampshire Institute of Art. While attending my main focus was on the
handmade process of black and white film. In 2012 I graduated with a
Fine Arts degree in Photography.</p>
<p>
Engine
is providing the space and the utility costs for the darkroom. I will
be responsible for the fit-up and equipment used in the darkroom. The
fit up includes electrical, plumbing work, installing ventilation,
along with purchasing various darkroom equipment for the proper
disposal of chemistry. No dumping chemistry down the drain...we are
stewards of our environment! The cost of this work will be $3000. If
successful in raising the funding, we will be able to open the
darkroom in early 2016.</p>
<p>
I'm
building this space because I love the ability to make something with
my hands. To express how I feel into a physical, tactile form is a
process I want to share with others seeking to learn and or have the

</div>","Hello,
I'm Tina Guay. I am building a community darkroom at Engine, a nonprofit arts organization
in downtown Biddeford, Maine.

In
the 5th grade I had the opportunity to shoot a
couple rolls of black and white film in a family friends studio. I
was able see how the film was processed to create beautiful images.
This experience inspired me to pursue this art form through high
school and college. I still remember the curiosity I experienced upon
developing and printing my first images.

I
continued that pursuit of curiosity through my education at the New
Hampshire Institute of Art. While attending my main focus was on the
handmade process of black and white film. In 2012 I graduated with a
Fine Arts degree in Photography.

Engine
is providing the space and the utility costs for the darkroom. I will
be responsible for the fit-up and equipment used in the darkroom. The
fit up includes electrical, plumbing work, installing ventilation,
along with purchasing various darkroom equipment for the proper
disposal of chemistry. No dumping chemistry down the drain...we are
stewards of our environment! The cost of this work will be $3000. If
successful in raising the funding, we will be able to open the
darkroom in early 2016.

I'm
building this space because I love the ability to make something with
my hands. To express how I feel into a physical, tactile form is a
process I want to share with others seeking to learn and or have the
same passion. I would like to be able to pay
forward the opportunity I was able to receive to others–kids,
adults, artists! $3,000 will make it possible to build a space not
only for black and white photography, but a place to create learn and
grow. Please consider a donation today. Thank you.Please help promote my campaign by sharing with your friends and family on facebook, twitter, instagram and email.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

We want to release 3 FIGURES of 1:24 scale (about 75 mm size) inspired in THOR, LOKI and FREYA of the norse mythology. 
These figures has already been sculpted in 3D by the great artists Farhad Nojumi and Ali Jalali under direction of Jesús Martin, designer and alma mater of Nocturna models.
Now we have to make it real printing and making the production of these figures, including painting the boxart ot these fantastic miniatures. Jesús will paint the master pieces, and we will be updating every step of this complete process with videos and pictures.
We had the great collaboration of some other artists to make the incredible Goals that can be gifts for you during this campaign. They are one big Ice Giant (by Daniel Bel), a Dvergr warrior dwarf style ( by Arun Nagar) and an incredible Fenrir wolf (by Caleb Nefzen). These figures will be printed and produced in 30 mm scale for all of you. It means that the Giant and the Wolf can be not so small...

Basically, you bump into a piece of Art (with a capital A) every 5 minutes. It's just incredible how Art enters the city and how city enters into Art. It has this fascinating mix of a postcard city, like Venice, -being one of the most popular tourist destinations, with all the treasures it has (Michelangelo's David alone would be quite enough) and a real city, with its busy streets, buses and people in a hurry (""all'Italiana"" obviously =). Add to that a rather severe medieval kick and you will get the picture. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Apart from that, there's definitely an ""off the beaten path"" Florence and in my project I want to show both well-known monuments and sites and the hidden ones. </strong><strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong>Let's get straight to the topic now. I am aiming to make 30 drawings, using special kind of pencils. I have elaborated this technique a while ago. It is all about the relation between colour and tone, the way I perceive every single colour. Erasing-is a crucial part of the process. There's nothing more satisfying than giving my drawing a good go with an eraser, in the light parts, where the sun toches marble or whichever other surface. I do call this technique ""drawing with an eraser""sometimes=) The pencils I use are coloured, though I am not approaching it as a ""paintily "" kind of drawing. That's to say I am not using a blue for a blue, or red for a red. It's more of a impressionist drawing. I am trying to create a certain mood, trying to build a story behind every monument, trying to capture that particular day, minute, second in which I was drawing it. So that you get the feeling you were there with me on that day to admire this site. </strong></p>
<p><strong>I want to make a sort of Art-postcards, original pieces that will remind you of Florence, even if you never been to. I want to share those memories with you, guys.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I would love to have  a possibility to exhibit this work. It would be great to have a possibility to familiarize the public with this project, sharing my mameories and emotions with people. What's the point of it, if you guy</strong><strong>s don't get to see it?)) And to realize that dream I will need your generous help, as nothing is free in this world, and getting a good space to exhibit costs a good deal. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Give  us (me and my art) a chance!!!=)</strong></p>

<p><strong>AN IMMENSE THANKYOU TO EVERYONE WHO SUPPORTS MY INITIATIVE !!!</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p></div>","I fell in love with this city almost 4 years ago and it never stops surprising me. Basically, you bump into a piece of Art (with a capital A) every 5 minutes. It's just incredible how Art enters the city and how city enters into Art. It has this fascinating mix of a postcard city, like Venice, -being one of the most popular tourist destinations, with all the treasures it has (Michelangelo's David alone would be quite enough) and a real city, with its busy streets, buses and people in a hurry (""all'Italiana"" obviously =). Add to that a rather severe medieval kick and you will get the picture. 
Apart from that, there's definitely an ""off the beaten path"" Florence and in my project I want to show both well-known monuments and sites and the hidden ones.  
 
Let's get straight to the topic now. I am aiming to make 30 drawings, using special kind of pencils. I have elaborated this technique a while ago. It is all about the relation between colour and tone, the way I perceive every single colour. Erasing-is a crucial part of the process. There's nothing more satisfying than giving my drawing a good go with an eraser, in the light parts, where the sun toches marble or whichever other surface. I do call this technique ""drawing with an eraser""sometimes=) The pencils I use are coloured, though I am not approaching it as a ""paintily "" kind of drawing. That's to say I am not using a blue for a blue, or red for a red. It's more of a impressionist drawing. I am trying to create a certain mood, trying to build a story behind every monument, trying to capture that particular day, minute, second in which I was drawing it. So that you get the feeling you were there with me on that day to admire this site. 
I want to make a sort of Art-postcards, original pieces that will remind you of Florence, even if you never been to. I want to share those memories with you, guys.
I would love to have  a possibility to exhibit this work. It would be great to have a possibility to familiarize the public with this project, sharing my mameories and emotions with people. What's the point of it, if you guys don't get to see it?)) And to realize that dream I will need your generous help, as nothing is free in this world, and getting a good space to exhibit costs a good deal. 
Give  us (me and my art) a chance!!!=)
I will need you help to cover materials cost as well. 
Your generosity and participation will not stay unrewarded.

     combinando muitas vezes dança, música, artes plásticas e teatro
     convencional. 
desafia a tradicional relação
     entra platéia e ator. 
celebra a audiência não
     passiva.
utiliza a imaginação da platéia
     em conjunto com a imaginação dos atores

 
vídeo
interativo em tempo real é a
primeira performance mostrada no vídeo promocional acima. é um software criado
por frieder weiss que interpreta o movimento do ator e é capaz de criar
projeções baseadas nos movimentos. é também capaz de criar sons a até música a
partir dos movimentos do ator. é um efeito belíssimo e se encaixa em free•dom
muito bem.
sobre esta campanha

esse é o primeiro passo para fazer free•dom
acontecer. O dinheiro arrecadado será destinado para desenvolver a peça,
aluguel de salas de ensaio, material de ensaio, material de pesquisa, objetos
cênicos, aluguel de equipamento, desenvolvimento de vídeos e para a pequena equipe
envolvida. é um orçamento apertado, mas podemos fazer acontecer. 
por que
somente o primeiro passo? porque é difícil arrecadar muito dinheiro de uma vez.
Mas, U$5.000 é só o mínimo, não é problema nenhum arrecadar mais a vai
certamente dar um gás ainda maior para free•dom.

outras formas de ajudar

divulgue! é a maneira mais fácil e rápida de ajudar. mas se você quiser ajudar
de alguma outra forma me mande um e-mail (info@andressafurletti.com),
certamente eu vou precisar de muita ajuda. talvez você tenha uma sala de ensaio,
talvez você queira vir filmar um ensaio, talvez você queira escrever sobre a
peça, talvez você tenha uma idéia ou uma sugestão. toda ajuda é sempre bem-vinda.

<h3>In a few words...</h3>
We are raising money for the BoochNonagon at camp Get Lost @ Burning Man 2012.  What's a BoochNonagon you ask? Let's start with what's a nonagon. Well, a nonagon is a 9 sided polygon. The Booch part refers the vaulted, carnival-like tent roof comprised of 14 foot long triangles made of dried kombucha leather. If you wondering what kombucha leather is, imagine a fruit roll up but instead of fruit the roll up is made of a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast in a cellulose pancake.</div>
<p>So that's what the BoochNonagon is.  But really, our camp is an opportunity for us to share what we love with the Burning Man community: giving people bad directions and good kombucha.  And although we love electronic music the  BoochNonagon will house a stage for the sometimes hard to find live musics. (If you'd like to contribute your talents and/or music by performing on our stage, we'd sincerely love to have you!  Please email us at <a href=""mailto:boochnonagon@gmail.com%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">boochnonagon@gmail.com</a></p>
<h3>Here's where it gets interesting</h3>
<p>So wait, we're GIFTING away Kombucha in a 9 sided structure with a roof made of dried kombucha leather and there's a stage inside for live music and performance? Yes, and here's where it gets really interesting...by generously contributing to the BoochNonagon and helping us make this happen we will hand deliver to you or a lucky friend a cold bottle of tasty revitalizing, rejuvenating, probiotic-rich, fermented tea to their front door, side door, geodesic  dome, RV, pup tent or spaceship!  We'll even deliver a message from you to them, or from you to yourself, which could be get interesting.  Just give us a the recipients name and their camp name and/or nearest cross-streets and we'll take care of the rest.<br/><br/> Think of it like your friend is celebrating their birthday out of state and because you cant go you call the restaurant and have a pint of the the high life sent to their table but instead of the champagne of beers its really good kombucha and instead of a table at a swanky restaurant it's their dust infested parcel of playa.</p>
<p>Or if it's for yourself think of it like going into the future to give yourself a gift of kombucha from the past.</p>
<p>And finally, just so you know the quality of the kombucha we're talking about...the people who make this kombucha make about 1000 gallons a month and distribute locally in Austin..which is just to say this isn't your average kombucha...and all teas and herbs used are both fair trade and organic!</p>
<h3>Here's how it works..</h3>
<p>Select your level of support and donate and we'll contact you within a day or two to confirm (and profusely thank you!) and get the info for the intended recipient of the bottle.  If it is for you or a friend or an enemy or Larry Harvey, this is the time to tell us.  With the exception of Larry Harvey, we'll need to know where your friend is staying and cross streets are good but ideally we'll get cross streets AND a camp name and the recipients name.  This email correspondance with us will also be your chance to request that a message be delivered as well.  You can even ask us to sing the message in any style of music.  Be aware that we might be stumped in which case we'll probably just read the message normally and then do a stupid dance.  Actually the stupid dance will likely be included either way.</p>

 My name is Bree Garland and I paint portraits of anyone and everyone 
here in sunny Portland, Oregon. Art has always been very important to 
me, but I didn't realize just how big of a role it played in my life 
until I was quickly approaching 30. Following a minor existential crisis 
at the age of 28, I bought a one way ticket to Europe, quit my serving 
job, and sold all of my belongings. I felt I had to figure out what I 
really wanted to do in life. I asked myself the question over and over. 
And every time the answer was Art. It scared me, and still does, because
 we live in a culture largely unsupportive of artists. But it's the only
 thing that makes me happy and I have to give happiness a chance or I 
will regret it for the rest of my life. Help me live my dream. Not only 
does it make me feel great, but all art enriches our souls and should 
never be squelched out.  When I packed up and went to Europe, it was very inspiring to people I know. I am hoping this will also do the same thing and encourage people to follow their dreams. If it turns out to work for me, then all the more reason to, right?! My goal is to show these portrait series in a gallery setting by the end of this year. <br/><br/>This campaign is for 3 series of 9 portraits each:<br/> Game of Thrones: Jon Snow, Daenerys, Joffrey, Ygritte, Hodor, Cersei, Tyrion, Arya, and the Hound  (currently working on)<br/></p>
<p> Nudes: of me and all my friends. We are overcoming society-induced body insecurities and shaming together. All shapes, sizes and colors are beautiful. (currently working on, yet to have all 9 persons needed)<br/> </p>
<p>Celebrity regrets: you know, all those embarrassing moments captured in time. Like when Britney Spears shaved her head, or when Pee Wee Herman got arrested, or when Justin Timberlake had bleached and gelled hair like dried ramen noodles, most of courtney love's court appearances.. you get the idea. (yet to start or have all details of all 9 characters)<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I'm asking for $3,000. Obviously any more would be a godsend. <br/></p>
<p> Monies will go towards:</p>
<p> -canvases, mediums, oils, brushes, other painting supplies, and unforeseen costs. </p>
<p>-business advancements like business cards, website, prints, and the campaign perks. <br/></p>
<p>-perks will include merch from my RGBG (Ryan Gosling//Bree Garland) line, prints of the series, and more. (my cat is named Ryan Gosling for all those who don't know me personally)<br/></p>
<p>-All the monies from the campaign will be used locally. <br/></p>
<p>-I want to use this opportunity to launch my etsy account to bring in funds from prints of these series and more to come in the future. Ideally, to make this into a giving me tools to eat for a lifetime than for a day sort of situation.<br/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div>This project is valuable because it will create a great sense of accomplishment and support for my artistic endeavors. I don't want to do this in vain, I believe in myself and in my art and I hope people feel feelings when they look at my portraits. If it emotes a feeling, whatever the feeling, or makes you think.. that is what I want at the base level. Art is crucial for everyone on earth. Art touches people, inspires them, gives meaning, and changes your views on life. People go insane, live, and die for their art and because of it. <br/>""Without art, the crudeness of reality would make the world unbearable""- G.B. Shaw<br/>
</div> <div>
<br/>Some risks and challenges?<br/>Well, for starters I'm really putting it all out there. Lots of feelings of rejection could come from this. But, if that happens, it's alright. It's not going to stop me. I mean, I might cry. But I'll pick up the pieces and use it as fuel. Most of the influential artists died without much recognition, if any at all. Who knows what the future holds. That's the fun part about life!<br/>

<h1>Project History</h1>
<p>People have been playing with LED's ever since they were invented.  LED's emit a brilliant, sharp, and beautiful light. With the use of RGB(Red,Green,Blue) LED's and a digital driver, it is possible to create<strong> MILLIONS</strong> of different colors, hues, shades, and intensities of light.</p>
<h1> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/472474/pictures/original/20121003111708-designprogress_copy.jpg?1349288233"" src="""" style=""""/>
</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>The LEDMorpher project was started in Jan of 2011 to explore the idea of making a display device with LED's rotating 360 degrees, but also simultaneously around a second 360 axis.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/472477/pictures/original/20121003111803-ccaprogram_copy.jpg?1349288290"" src="""" style=""""/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/472471/pictures/original/20121003111609-bracket_copy.jpg?1349288175"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The combination of 2 separate rotating axes would yield an ALL DIMENSION volumetric unlimited voxel display.  Early challenges centered around how to transmit digital control data not only across 1 spinning mass, but additionally across 2 simultaneously spinning masses without using any direct wiring or contact points.  This research lead to the invention of our ""Digital Light Slip Ring"" (Patent Pending). This makes controlling the LED's reliable and affordable for consumer product uses.</p>
<p> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/472479/pictures/original/20121003111853-propellerdesign_copy.jpg?1349288335"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The next step of the project was to design a producible product that used the combination of manipulating the speed of the 2 separate axes along with changing the color and frequency of the LED's.  Further enhancements of the product include the 3 different modes of operation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic show runs from PIC chip</li>
<li>Music mode that responds to sound</li>
<li>Remote Control, where users manipulate features via remote control</li>
</ul>
<h1>Project Status</h1>
<p>As you can see from the videos we've been working hard building prototypes, writing code, building tooling, and making the final adjustments for production. We've also filed for patent protection, trademarks and copyrights. We've visited, negotiated and selected the various component manufacturing partners that it takes to manufacture the LEDMorpher with care and strict attention to detail. The manufacturing plan is to bring in the sub-assemblies (Circuit Card, Motors, Flex Harness, Moldings, etc) from our manufacturing partners, and do the final assembly, quality testing, packaging and shipping in Florida. Since 1997,we have forged strong relationships with world class manufacturers in Shenzhen and  the surrounding area. In conjunction with this campaign we are currently running life testing, reliability testing, testing the pilot production units, and finishing the iOS and Android Apps. </p>
<p> </p>
<h1>Please Help us get into Production</h1>
<p>We need your support to take the LEDMorpher from prototype to production. Cutting edge technology is notoriously expensive. We have self funded the entire research, development and prototyping and tooling efforts to date. We think people will love playing with the LEDMorpher, we also believe in the power of community, the maker movement, open source, and hackers everywhere. So this is where <strong>you</strong> come in. In order to make this product available at a reasonable price, we need to manufacture in large quantities. You can be part of making this Cool LEDMorpher project a reality, your pledge will help us pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Large volume sub-assembly orders(Manufacturers are ready)</li>
<li>Finish iOS and Android App interface and launch</li>
<li>Manufacturing support/oversight/freight</li>
</ul>
<p>We dream of a community where creativity can become a reality because  passionate people love the idea enough to support it. <strong>Together</strong> we can do it!!</p>
<h1>Backer Perks</h1>
<p><strong>Every</strong> LEDMorpher comes with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wall Power Adapter, 100-240v 50/60Hz with 10 foot cord(USA plug config)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Your choice of Controllers, either LEDMorpher IR Remote, or Smartphone Remote with free APP (iOS, or Android).</li>

<p>Breaking Down by Retchild, Licensed thru Audiosparx.com</p>
<p><strong>Can I operate the LEDMorpher in any orientation?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, they work the same regardless of spatial orientation, you can hang them from the ceiling or sticking out from the wall.</p>
<p><strong>What powers the LEDMorpher?</strong></p>
<p>It is powered by 12vdc that is supplied from the included power adapter.  This power cable is 10 feet long and plugs into the wall socket. It has USA plug prongs, so International backers may have to use a plug adapter for their particular wall plug. It's universal Worldwide and works with 100-240v 50/60HZ.</p>
<p><strong>Is the Software Opensource and  is it Hackable?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the software code will be available to any backer at reward shipment time, just be reminded that once you overwrite our stuff we're not responsible. We even built in a special Hacker Jack into the Circuit Board. You can plug into it and load your own code into the PIC, to make your own animations, designs, etc. Please send us videos of your work so we can post them on our website. We absolutely do not recommend removing the acrylic globe, if you do you might get your hand spanked from the rotating parts! Hack at your own risk. And we have to say this...it voids the warranty.</p>
<p><strong>4D? Really?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, sort of. The 4th dimension is commonly described by physicists as SpaceTime. In its simplest form it recognizes not only where something is within X-Y-Z, but <strong>WHEN</strong> something is there. Our brains recognize not only where light is, but where it used to be. In other words the human brain fills in the path of the LED's from past time to present time.  With all respect given to Quantum Relativity and String Theory, who really cares?? LEDMorpher is just plain cool to watch!</p>
<p><strong>OK, so I'm a real Geek, tell me in more detail what is going on?</strong></p>
<p>Here we go, the physical world is described in 3 dimensions, X-Y-Z. Within a fixed sphere every possible location instead of being designated by a Pixel(2D), its designated by a Voxel(3D). Unlike all other POV(Persistence of Vision) displays which only show you the outside of the sphere voxels, LEDMorpher is capable of lighting up almost (not the very center) all of the voxels in the entire sphere. That's because as you vary the speeds of the 2 different axes, you also change the arcs of travel, causing the LED's to intersect the interior portion of the sphere. You already know from the information above that the LEDMorpher is operated only by remote control. The reason for this is that the Circuit Board Assembly which controls everything needs to spin, so no physical control connections are possible.</p>
<p>The control board consists of several different parts. The first is the input receiver section, this section receives the IR signals from either the LEDMorpher IR Remote, or the Smartphone IR remote. The receiver section encodes the incoming signals and sends them to the PIC (Programmable Integrated Circuit) for further processing. The second section of the Circuit Board is the Music Sensing section. This consists of a microphone and encoding circuit that hears the music input and encodes it and sends the signal to the PIC for further processing. The propeller drive motor also lives on this board, the motor takes it speed signal from the pic output, driving the speed of the propeller. The PIC section is where the digital logic lives, and the computer <strong>Automatic Show</strong> is loaded into memory. The last section of the board is the output section. This is where the drivers for the RGB LED's are located.This RGB LED lighting information is sent up the propeller support to our Patent Pending ""Digital Light Slip Ring"" This is where the real magic happens, transmitting the digital signal to the spinning propeller without using any physical connections.  After traveling through the slip ring the control signals finally arrive at the LED's and they light as instructed. If you want to know more, I will probably have to hire you.</p>

</div></div>","LEDMorpher-Overview
LEDMorpher is a tabletop size LED light show. It has LED's mounted on a propeller that spins while simultaneously rotating around a 2nd axis.  By changing the propeller speed, 2nd axis speed, color and frequency of the LED's, LEDMorpher delivers unlimited mind-blowing, continuously changing, fantastic, brilliantly colored visual effects.  You can manipulate MILLIONS of different colors, hues, intensities and paths of light to form unlimited displays, from counter-rotating spherical orbs to random light chaos.
LEDMorpher has 3 Function Modes:

Automatic show-30 minutes of wonder
Reacts to the Beat of Your Music
You Control It- Using IR Remote or Smartphone IR Remote with free APP

LEDMorpher is perfect for Desktop, Bartop, Coffee Table, or Dorm Room.
We need your backing for the first production order. We are ready to produce. In order to keep the price down we need to build these in at least 2,000 unit lot size.

Project History
People have been playing with LED's ever since they were invented.  LED's emit a brilliant, sharp, and beautiful light. With the use of RGB(Red,Green,Blue) LED's and a digital driver, it is possible to create MILLIONS of different colors, hues, shades, and intensities of light.
 

 
The LEDMorpher project was started in Jan of 2011 to explore the idea of making a display device with LED's rotating 360 degrees, but also simultaneously around a second 360 axis.
 
 
The combination of 2 separate rotating axes would yield an ALL DIMENSION volumetric unlimited voxel display.  Early challenges centered around how to transmit digital control data not only across 1 spinning mass, but additionally across 2 simultaneously spinning masses without using any direct wiring or contact points.  This research lead to the invention of our ""Digital Light Slip Ring"" (Patent Pending). This makes controlling the LED's reliable and affordable for consumer product uses.
 
The next step of the project was to design a producible product that used the combination of manipulating the speed of the 2 separate axes along with changing the color and frequency of the LED's.  Further enhancements of the product include the 3 different modes of operation.

Automatic show runs from PIC chip
Music mode that responds to sound
Remote Control, where users manipulate features via remote control

Project Status
As you can see from the videos we've been working hard building prototypes, writing code, building tooling, and making the final adjustments for production. We've also filed for patent protection, trademarks and copyrights. We've visited, negotiated and selected the various component manufacturing partners that it takes to manufacture the LEDMorpher with care and strict attention to detail. The manufacturing plan is to bring in the sub-assemblies (Circuit Card, Motors, Flex Harness, Moldings, etc) from our manufacturing partners, and do the final assembly, quality testing, packaging and shipping in Florida. Since 1997,we have forged strong relationships with world class manufacturers in Shenzhen and  the surrounding area. In conjunction with this campaign we are currently running life testing, reliability testing, testing the pilot production units, and finishing the iOS and Android Apps. 
 
Please Help us get into Production
We need your support to take the LEDMorpher from prototype to production. Cutting edge technology is notoriously expensive. We have self funded the entire research, development and prototyping and tooling efforts to date. We think people will love playing with the LEDMorpher, we also believe in the power of community, the maker movement, open source, and hackers everywhere. So this is where you come in. In order to make this product available at a reasonable price, we need to manufacture in large quantities. You can be part of making this Cool LEDMorpher project a reality, your pledge will help us pay for:

Large volume sub-assembly orders(Manufacturers are ready)
Finish iOS and Android App interface and launch
Manufacturing support/oversight/freight

We dream of a community where creativity can become a reality because  passionate people love the idea enough to support it. Together we can do it!!

<p><span>El edificio que adoptamos como centro de trabajo, ubicado en la calle de Laurel numero 41, fue construido con el fin de ser laboratorios escolares a principios de la década de los 90 y posteriormente abandonado en 1999.</span></p>
<p>Como HAMSTERS, llegamos a este edificio en diciembre del 2013 para sacar a este espacio del abandono, trabajando duro, resanando y pintando las paredes, limpiando pisos y ventanas. Comenzamos este proyecto que presentamos oficialmente el 4 de enero de 2014 con nuestra primera exposición como grupo  titulada “Obra Negra”.</p>

Además nos encantará seguir en contacto con ustedes, a través de nuestros medios para mostrarles los avances de nuestro trabajo y los resultados de su apoyo.


El impacto
El edificio que adoptamos como centro de trabajo, ubicado en la calle de Laurel numero 41, fue construido con el fin de ser laboratorios escolares a principios de la década de los 90 y posteriormente abandonado en 1999.
Como HAMSTERS, llegamos a este edificio en diciembre del 2013 para sacar a este espacio del abandono, trabajando duro, resanando y pintando las paredes, limpiando pisos y ventanas. Comenzamos este proyecto que presentamos oficialmente el 4 de enero de 2014 con nuestra primera exposición como grupo  titulada “Obra Negra”.













Hasta el día de hoy , llevamos más de 7 meses trabajando para  instaurar el Centro de Operaciones Pictóricas como un referente de pintura emergente en la ciudad de México.

Comenzando con el lugar menos ""apropiado"" y con pocas expectativas de la gente hacia nuestra idea; hemos realizado 9 eventos, entre exposiciones individuales una colectiva y diversas actividades dentro y fuera del espacio; con excelentes resultados que han sido reseñados por diversos medios, en formatos tanto impresos como digitales, en más de 15 ocasiones. 

Ahora, buscamos potenciar los resultados del trabajo que hemos realizado antes sin esta ayuda.
























Otras formas en las que puedes ayudar

<p><br/>I am an artist. I have dedicated my life to creativity. I have focused my interests, honed my craft, pursued every opportunity, and now am on the threshold of the largest milestone of my career so far. I am being given the opportunity to present the first comprehensive exhibition of my work. The Oats Park Art Center in Fallon, Nevada will dedicate its’ entire 2100 square foot gallery space to my work in the spring and summer of 2013. Please consider contributing to this campaign to help cover my costs for this show.</p>
<p>This moment is especially dynamic for me because I am in the process of fusing my passions into a career. This exhibition will culminate 10 years of painting and drawing, making clear both my underlying interests and my development as an artist. Since I began painting and drawing, I have been creatively chronicling the evidence of human need and its’ deleterious effect on the landscape. My work stems from historic and environmental research, which has continually led me to Nevada. Mines, weapons arsenals, industrial scale farming, and nuclear test sites surround the town of Fallon. Showing my work in Fallon, Nevada will further the relationship that I am fostering with rural peoples, places, and issues.</p>
<p>The Oats Park Art Center is beautiful and supportive, yet has a small budget. They will provide exhibition space and facilities cost for the duration of the exhibit, and a small stipend for an artist talk. I am responsible for the remainder of expenses. My financial resources are meager. With the success of this campaign, I will produce a professional exhibition that will accelerate my career and validate my work. The money I raise will be used to frame 5 large drawings, build protective crates for more than 20 paintings, and to rent and fuel a truck to move these paintings from New Mexico to Nevada and back. I will travel with the work, and install the show myself.</p>
<p>I see this exhibition as the greatest opportunity I have yet been presented with. Please help me make it a reality!</p>

My current motorcycle is small, simple, easy to repair and gas efficient. I'll be gone for a long time, which means I won't have a home to pay rent for.

My name is Heather Johnson. I've been a working visual artist for close to 25 years, inspired by the landscape and the feeling I get when I travel through it.
It's been nearly two years since I first launched In Search of the Frightening and Beautiful, my ongoing motorcycle journey and visual art project. It all started in 2012 with an invitation to the BoxoHOUSE artist residency program in Joshua Tree, CA. The invitation became a departure point for something massive. Since then, I have ridden alone over 25,000 miles and have left 30 small gifts everywhere in the form of hand-embroidered art works, dropped in the landscapes of the United States and Mexico, for random folks to encounter and keep. 
I have had experiences too profound to describe. I've ridden through monsoons. Met total strangers who've saved my life. Crashed several times on muddy, rocky, rutted dirt roads. And made many new friends, whose words and actions will stay with me for the rest of my life. (Read about much of this on the project blog, here.)
IN SEARCH OF THE FRIGHTENING & BEAUTIFUL is motivated by a need for connection and understanding in a world governed too frequently by fear, ignorance and mistrust. It crosses geographic and cultural boundaries,  leaving bits of humanity in its wake in the form of intimate, painstakingly-made gestures let loose in the landscape, set adrift in the world to change hands, context and meaning.
                                    

                                    
Since March 2013, I have made 25 new works of art based on experiences from my journey, which have been shown in four exhibitions in New York, Mexico and California. (For more information about my work and art practice, see  http://heatherLjohnson.com.)


I've given lectures at two universities, conducting a workshop for students at one of them. I've just completed the first frightening and beautiful book, hot off the press and ready to ship. Articles have been written, the Facebook page is active and the project's audience is growing, confirming the need to keep it alive. You could say I have unfinished business to take care of.
NEXT MONTH I WILL HEAD SOUTH AGAIN, this time much farther, as far as resources will allow, toward the bottom of the southern hemisphere. I will venture back down through Mexico, into Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and with a little luck, across the Darien Gap into Colombia and beyond. I'll leave in my wake a trail of new pieces, embroidered with motorcycle body parts and bits of text describing observations I've collected so far on the journey... small bits of humanity intended to coincide with the lives of total strangers, whose cultures and languages different from my own. When I return, I'll continue to grow what I've started, incorporating what I've learned into new books, embroideries and other media that build upon the story I've only just started to tell.


I need your help.   This is not something I can do without the financial and moral support of every person who believes in me and wants me to keep it going. The fundraising goal is a big one.

Great for your tree, but can be hung in the window the rest of the year, so the sunlight makes them sparkle and glow. They're made to be heirlooms, so are nice and thick art glass.</p>

<p>The Convection Series represents the relative flows of fluidic heat. They are hand blown to achieve their sensual curved shapes, precisely balanced, cut to stand tall and polished to be brilliant. Then, using the lost art of reverse painting, they are infused with vivid and soft colors that enhance and intensify the gorgeous refraction of the crystal. Sizes range from 10 to 18 inches. While colors may vary slightly, due to the nature of reverse painting they are always intense and beautiful. Available in six colors: Orange &amp; Warm Yellow, Blue &amp; Cool White, Indigo &amp; Raspberry, Forest Green &amp; Cool Yellow, Blue &amp; Aquamarine, Purple &amp; Blue-White.</p>

<p>You can watch it for hours, as the orbs serenely ghost along on the gentle zephyrs surrounding them. Sometimes, they move at about the speed of the real planets. Nothing appears to be moving but when you return after a few hours, Saturn is over <span style=""font-style: italic;"">there</span>. They even operate on the same principles of a solar system. Based upon balanced proportional mass, the objects move about barycenters. As they orbit, the planets perturb the Sun; just like real planets do—but on an obviously different scale.</p>

<p>They come to us, one way or another—some as singletons, some as whole families, some evidently having traveled long distances and in bad shape, some injured—asking for help. We take them in; providing them with a haven, needed medical attention, rehabilitation ... and love. They become adopted members of our family with remarkable success and live full, rich, safe and happy lives!</p>
<p>Our place looks like a Daycare center; toys everywhere, people napping wherever they happen to collapse.  :)  It's been rewarding and sometimes heartbreaking, but well worth every effort, every second and every penny.. After all, we don't really have a choice... do we?</p>

<p>In helping them over the years, we've also felt the calling to use our talents to help many others by creating Kitty Memorials for passed-on Furever Friends. It's the very least we could do to help ease the pain that we, ourselves, have felt so deeply.</p>
<p>During these blowing sessions we become so emotionally and spiritually connected when respectfully handling the remains that we have to stop for a few moments to blot the tears, so we can see. When the completed memorial emerges from the annealer the following day, what we feel inside cannot ever be put into mere words.</p>

<p>We work hard for that and we work hard for our rescues, but we have a problem that we need help with.</p>

<h5 style=""text-align: center;"">~  Forced Out of Our Home<span style=""font-size: 75%; font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;"">    or    </span>Speaking of Predators...  ~</h5>
<p>Due to a predatory loan from Bank of America, our mortgage payment has been steadily increasing until it got unaffordable; as they raised the payment to over <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">$7,600/month!</span> We've been working diligently since 2009 to modify it, but they have had us on a 5+ year merry-go-round of: ""lost"" documents, ""never received"" docs, incorrect forms to follow (no wonder they never received the required docs), ""expired"" docs, and docs received but then ""invalidated"" for obviously dubious reasons.</p>
<p>It was a shell game. They've been quietly tacking thousands and thousands of dollars onto the original principal; all the while threatening us with auctions that they would then put off for another month to keep us distracted and believing that relief was still possible if we persevered.</p>
<p>Once we got the Treasury Department involved, suddenly: <span style=""font-style: italic;"">""We have all of the required documents.""</span> and the bankers granted an MHA Loan Modification in <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">two weeks time!</span></p>
<p>However, their ""solution"" isn't the relief that HAMP was intended to be. The payments on their now-inflated principal add up to more than 4.5x what the property is actually worth.</p>

<p>We are making their new ""lower"", but still exorbitant, payments but that's not an option for the long term. They are extorting us by pushing off the auction to the very next month to immediately evict if we don't pay. We have no choice, no time! Our only viable option, and the only responsible thing to do money-wise, is to move immediately!</p>
<p>We are moving not only the rescue shelter and household goods but, along with them, a whole business. Our genius lab holds a lot of densely sphere-packed stuff. Glass blowing is an endeavor that requires a lot of equipment, tools and materials that must be handled with care: water cooled saws and grinders, kilns, annealers, marvers, gaffer's benches, pipes, pontils, the list goes on...</p>
<p>Some of the equipment is large and very heavy, yet delicate; as is the glass. Dismantling everything that we've built; unwiring and extracting it, disassembling it, packing it, transporting it and setting it all up again is going to be an arduous task.</p>

<p>We pledge that there are no risks. All of these items already exist. They're not in development; they are tangible and proven. We will make good on all that is offered. We are in this for the long haul and we want you to be with us.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bolder;"">This studio is who we are. It's our calling. It's our jobs. It's our life.</p>
<p>We will be setting it back up in our new location as quickly as possible. We need to be running for the Christmas season, so the only challenge is if we are pushed later than October and some of the items would get minor delays. All of these rewards we have made before, and can be made in our new location.</p>
<p>We will be in touch every step of the way, through here and with the websites for contact. If there are delays, you will be notified. The glassblowing studio will be one of the final things we shut down before the move, so hopefully we will be able to create many of the smaller works and ship them ahead of the estimated dates.</p>
<p>This is our life, so we <span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">will</span> make this happen, even if that means renting studio time with another glassblower until we can get our studio all set up and running full tilt.</p>

</h2></div>","TL;DR
Hi! I'm Watson! I'm a rescue kitty. Mom and Dad have been doing all they can to save our home and their business, but we're scared. The bankers have raised the mortgage payments to stupid amounts and are now forcing us out of our home/studio/shelter.
Mom and Dad say that there is strength in numbers and lots of small contributions can add up to make a big difference. We're small, we add up and do make a big difference, so I guess they are right.
They have helped us so much and we want to help them now, so we put together this campaign to raise the funds necessary to help us get a new Furever home and them a new studio to continue making beauty and saving lives.
Your support will mean so much to my brothers and sisters, and to those I have yet to meet and play with. You'll get beautiful artwork in return, hand made by our Mom and Dad.
Our full story is below the PERKS, along with my brothers' and sisters' photos and examples of Mom and Dad's glass work. Be sure to visit our Gallery for more photos and videos and add your Comments, too. Please use the Share Links on this page, so that your friends may come here easily to see us and help.
Thank You ...from All of Us,Watson

They are made from multiple colors of glass to depict each planet's characteristics, using scientific data.

· •  Convection - $850  • ·


•  I Want This Perk  •
The Convection Series represents the relative flows of fluidic heat. They are hand blown to achieve their sensual curved shapes, precisely balanced, cut to stand tall and polished to be brilliant. Then, using the lost art of reverse painting, they are infused with vivid and soft colors that enhance and intensify the gorgeous refraction of the crystal. Sizes range from 10 to 18 inches. While colors may vary slightly, due to the nature of reverse painting they are always intense and beautiful. Available in six colors: Orange & Warm Yellow, Blue & Cool White, Indigo & Raspberry, Forest Green & Cool Yellow, Blue & Aquamarine, Purple & Blue-White.

•  This Perk Found A Home  •


· •  6 Foot Diameter Solar System Mobile - $3,000  • ·


•  I Want This Perk  •
The mobile is similar to the one above (that one is 24 feet), but made with  the Sun, 8 planets and Pluto from our Solar System Collection. Each orb is made with multiple colors of glass to depict the particular planet's characteristics, using scientific data. Then, we mold carbon fiber feathers for each planet to rotate around the Sun! Awesome!!!


· •  Humongous Solar System Mobile - $74,000 • ·


•  I Want This Perk  •
The Sun is 18 inches (46cm) in diameter, Saturn's rings are 23 inches (58cm). The completed structure measures 18 feet (5.5m) from Sun to Pluto/Charon. The complete stack is taller than a person and yet weighs only 49 lbs. (22kg).
It is made of blown glass, carbon fiber, polycarbonate, aircraft grade hardware and aluminum, and stainless steel safety wire.
You can watch it for hours, as the orbs serenely ghost along on the gentle zephyrs surrounding them. Sometimes, they move at about the speed of the real planets. Nothing appears to be moving but when you return after a few hours, Saturn is over there. They even operate on the same principles of a solar system. Based upon balanced proportional mass, the objects move about barycenters. As they orbit, the planets perturb the Sun; just like real planets do—but on an obviously different scale.
It's all ready to go and can be installed by the end of Summer.

  The Good

""When a person loves cats, I am their friend and comrade, without further introduction.""- • Mark Twain • -
Our Effort — Our Calling:

We run a small rescue shelter for abandoned, orphaned and abused kitties. Together, we have saved 32 lives. Individually, many more. 17 are currently under our care.

They come to us, one way or another—some as singletons, some as whole families, some evidently having traveled long distances and in bad shape, some injured—asking for help. We take them in; providing them with a haven, needed medical attention, rehabilitation ... and love. They become adopted members of our family with remarkable success and live full, rich, safe and happy lives!
Our place looks like a Daycare center; toys everywhere, people napping wherever they happen to collapse.  :)  It's been rewarding and sometimes heartbreaking, but well worth every effort, every second and every penny.. After all, we don't really have a choice... do we?
Sharing From That Which We Have Been Given:

Ash Inclusion Memorial
In helping them over the years, we've also felt the calling to use our talents to help many others by creating Kitty Memorials for passed-on Furever Friends. It's the very least we could do to help ease the pain that we, ourselves, have felt so deeply.
During these blowing sessions we become so emotionally and spiritually connected when respectfully handling the remains that we have to stop for a few moments to blot the tears, so we can see. When the completed memorial emerges from the annealer the following day, what we feel inside cannot ever be put into mere words.
A Safe Outdoor Place to Run and Climb:

Be sure to view the videos and photos on our Gallery Tab; especially ones of the KittEnclosure that we built to give them a place to run and climb; safe from the large predators that live on this mountain. It's really fun to watch the kids climb The Tower to the Branch Bridge between areas. They love it and so will you!

Hello! I'm Joy Alyssa Day, a professional artist of 25 years. I specialize in Glass Blowing, Reverse Glass and Traditional Painting. My partner, BJ Johnson, is an artist-engineer, specializing in Concept Design, 3D Modeling, Animation, Glass Blowing and Technical Illustration. Learn more about us through the links above or in the Our Team section, just below.
Being multidisciplinary, we're into a lot of different stuff:
We've created paintings from miniatures up to a 26 Foot (8m) Canvas Mural,


The Origin Of Meteorites at Chabot Space & Science Center, Oakland, California

Spacecraft illustrations for NASA Headquarters, JPL, Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, Scientific American, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Forbes, Fortune, Time, Newsweek, New Yorker, Coca-Cola, Smithsonian
Sculptures up to a 7 Foot Tall, 345 lb. Blown Glass Award (seen below)

A 6 Foot Wide Programmable Orrery

A 40 Foot Wide Blown Glass & Carbon Fiber Mobile of the Solar System

The Planetary Society Cosmos Award (seen below)

The 2014 Hugo Award


... to name only a very few. Much of that was before 2008, when you-know-what happened... to everyone. Well, most everyone that is.
Still, our ArtWorks have been commissioned, purchased and enjoyed by patrons and clients spanning the globe, through Amazon, Artfire, and our websites. It has been an honor to see them travel so far and enrich so many lives.

We're In the Business of Making a Difference.
We work hard for that and we work hard for our rescues, but we have a problem that we need help with.

  The Bad

~  Forced Out of Our Home    or    Speaking of Predators...  ~
Due to a predatory loan from Bank of America, our mortgage payment has been steadily increasing until it got unaffordable; as they raised the payment to over $7,600/month! We've been working diligently since 2009 to modify it, but they have had us on a 5+ year merry-go-round of: ""lost"" documents, ""never received"" docs, incorrect forms to follow (no wonder they never received the required docs), ""expired"" docs, and docs received but then ""invalidated"" for obviously dubious reasons.
It was a shell game. They've been quietly tacking thousands and thousands of dollars onto the original principal; all the while threatening us with auctions that they would then put off for another month to keep us distracted and believing that relief was still possible if we persevered.
Once we got the Treasury Department involved, suddenly: ""We have all of the required documents."" and the bankers granted an MHA Loan Modification in two weeks time!
However, their ""solution"" isn't the relief that HAMP was intended to be. The payments on their now-inflated principal add up to more than 4.5x what the property is actually worth.

  The Ugly


· •  The Challenge At Hand  • ·


We are making their new ""lower"", but still exorbitant, payments but that's not an option for the long term. They are extorting us by pushing off the auction to the very next month to immediately evict if we don't pay. We have no choice, no time! Our only viable option, and the only responsible thing to do money-wise, is to move immediately!
We are moving not only the rescue shelter and household goods but, along with them, a whole business. Our genius lab holds a lot of densely sphere-packed stuff. Glass blowing is an endeavor that requires a lot of equipment, tools and materials that must be handled with care: water cooled saws and grinders, kilns, annealers, marvers, gaffer's benches, pipes, pontils, the list goes on...
Some of the equipment is large and very heavy, yet delicate; as is the glass. Dismantling everything that we've built; unwiring and extracting it, disassembling it, packing it, transporting it and setting it all up again is going to be an arduous task.

· •  A Silver Lining  • ·


While this is very stressful, the positive that we are focusing on is that it can be an opportunity to get a studio that is sustainable for the long term. We'll be paying far less with more room to create and be able to focus on the new and exciting ideas we've wanted to make; without this stress monkey on our backs.
You're Invited!
We'll be able to host classes, workshops, events and more; something we've wanted to do for a long time! And we'll be able to help more kitties find their own Furever Home and you can meet them all.


· •  Here Is Where You Can Make A Difference  • ·

We only have a little time. We HAVE to move by October, so that we're back in production for the Christmas season.
We need to raise at least $20,000 to help with moving costs, packing and transporting all of this heavy equipment and glass, plus our beloved rescues, from California up to Washington and getting us back up and creating again quickly. For the entire time that we will be down, we will have no income, so we need your help to be able to successfully bridge this gap and make it to the other side.
Help us save lives and create beautiful things for you to enjoy.
If you agree that ours is a worthwhile effort, jump back to the top of this page, select any PERK and let the bank know who you support.

· •  More Ways You Can Help  • ·

Watson says: ""PLEASE SHARE ME!!""

Please use the Share Links at the top of this page and help spread the word, so that our GOGOFACTOR gets a needed boost and we get seen. Please tell your friends and family, your coworkers, your coffee shop, your snuggle kitty....
Please make an entry on the Comments Tab to offer a testimonial about us and our work. And be sure to take a look at the Gallery Tab for more videos and photos of our rescue kitties and other items we make.


· •  Risks & Challenges  • ·

We pledge that there are no risks. All of these items already exist. They're not in development; they are tangible and proven. We will make good on all that is offered. We are in this for the long haul and we want you to be with us.
This studio is who we are. It's our calling. It's our jobs. It's our life.
We will be setting it back up in our new location as quickly as possible. We need to be running for the Christmas season, so the only challenge is if we are pushed later than October and some of the items would get minor delays. All of these rewards we have made before, and can be made in our new location.
We will be in touch every step of the way, through here and with the websites for contact. If there are delays, you will be notified. The glassblowing studio will be one of the final things we shut down before the move, so hopefully we will be able to create many of the smaller works and ship them ahead of the estimated dates.
This is our life, so we will make this happen, even if that means renting studio time with another glassblower until we can get our studio all set up and running full tilt.

<p> </p></div>","Short Summary
I want to set up a small studio for my mother where she can create gifts. She is very skillful and talented and she's got art thinking. She can create unique things from different materials: small souvenirs, gifts made of various textile products, glass ornaments, icons and small pictures, earrings, bracelets, candles, etc. She has a flair for packaging and generally knows how to please people with small gestures.


Unfortunately, now she has no chance to work this, and has to work in large industrial factory to earn for a living. And I just want her to be happy.For several years I have been trying to raise money to realize this art gift shop for her. She lives in Bulgaria and the studio will be there, too. I developed the idea and I did some calculations and business plan for what will be needed for a small studio and web gallery to represent handmade products.


What We Need & What You Get
- Studio 30 square meters - rent for 6 months - $ 4 200
- Administrative costs of start-up - $ 750- Equipment and repair - $ 820- Materials and tools - $ 3 800- Building a website / web gallery of products - $ 1 400- Advertising material, business cards, flyers, adwords campaign - $ 700Total: $ 11 670The last two years I have collected some of the amount that I need, but I definitely need help.

<h3>Help Co-Create Fractal Nation 2012!</h3>
<p>There so many different ingredients that create this transformational alchemy, and by far the most important element is YOU. The Fractal needs you, and it needs you now. To create enough momentum for this fractal to rise up we need everyone's help.</p>
<p>Fractal Nation is at a pivotal turning point now that will determine the fate of this community coming out to the Playa in 2012.  If you are riding the fence and considering camping on the fringe and just coming for the party there may not be a party to come too without your support.  Please keep in mind that this is a self financed transformation, we have no financial sponsors, angels investors or bawlers to bail us out, the responsibility rests firmly on our own shoulders. This is entirely a roots initiative, and takes each and every one, every cent &amp; contribution to pull this production together. I have seen the power, witnessed the beauty and shared the glory when we come all together and I want to see us achieve that again.  </p>

<p>My name is Android Jones, founding instigator of FNV.  Fractal Nation started as a small idea and has evolved into a greater vision beyond my imagination.  In 2011, working together as a family and team, we created an unprecedented experience that enriched the lives and destiny of thousands of people, and together we formed a new nexus of community.  This year will be my 10th burn, and last year at Fractal was one of the deepest and most meaningful experiences I have ever had on the Playa. <br/><br/>It is our dream again to unite all of our separate busy lives, paths, skills, love, and energy to reform the fractal and create a beacon of creativity and positive energy whose ripple will all exceed and magnify our individual efforts.<br/><br/>Together we are all exponentially stronger than the sum of our parts, each member of Fractal Nation adds to the spiral.  Many of us have all shared different experiences at burning man and they have shaped us into the people we are today. Participating in Fractal Nation is an invitation and opportunity to transcend our roles as individual artists, and become the stewards of a higher experience to thousands of people.This year there will be more virgin burners than ever before and this is an opportunity to show so many of these new mind blown individuals the power of what happens when a community comes together for a common goal.<br/><br/>There so many different ingredients that create this transformational alchemy, and by far the most important element is YOU.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>
		I am a Seattle painter, calligrapher and writer. I create paintings 
with my own calligraphy. I also teach calligraphy classes and have been 
disappointed to hear that many area schools are no longer teaching 
cursive writing - and some have had to cut their art curriculum. I'd 
like to be able to donate money to Seattle Public Schools to help 
increase their arts programs, as I know it's the first thing being cut 
which to me is the soul of childhood - being able to create and make art
 was one of the best parts of my childhood.</p>
<p>
		I heard about IndieGoGo as a way to raise money, while listening to a 
segment on Good Morning America. One of the ideas I had was to donate a 
portion of sales of my posters to schools, but in order to do this I 
need some funding to get posters printed and apparently IndiGoGo is 
exactly the sort of program to help spread the word and raise funds to 
make my dream come true.</p>
<p>
		My current series deals with SOUL. Everything that is inside us that wants and needs to get out. Starting with <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Alphabet for the Soul</span>
 I want to print this series of posters. I'm calling it The Souls 
Project and will donate 20% of my poster sales to The Seattle Public 
School system. I already have several other paintings ready in my series
 - one with alphabet letters, one with a colorful design with 
numbers and yes a wonderful painting I have about quotes I've collected about teaching. I am a prolific painter - only being held back by limited funds
 for art supplies and printing costs. Nothing new and different to 
anyone who is an artist. I started by business back in 1996 as One Heart
 Studio - because I was doing my heart's desire, but also it's a 
reflection of us all as being part of one world.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>
		I don't know what the impact will be. I've always wanted to help 
support my local schools and give back to the community, but having a 
limited income as an artist has always made it incredibly hard. When you
 start talking about soul - it is everyone's soul that I hope will be 
affected by this project - it's the words on the paintings I have 
created, it's the colors of the paint, it's the heart and soul that I 
put into every piece I create. But it's also the little souls that will 
get to blossom and grow through art programs in their schools. I just 
can't even imagine all the possibilities this project will create for

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I will use the funds collected on IndieGoGo for printing services and I 
will sell the posters online as well as in retail galleries throughout 
the United States. 20% of the proceeds from sales of these posters will 
go back into the Seattle Schools. I will start with one small poster for
 $200 will get me started. If I do not receive enough to print a single poster, I will contribute my own money to start the project. A simple starting point, but the more 
money I get receive more images I can print and sell. I am already a 
published artist with many images already being licensed, but I want 
this to be my personal project that helps my own block, my own 
neighborhood, my own city. That's where I want it to start. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>$   500 raised  = @3,000 printed posters (11"" x 17"") sold at $10 retail* each = $6000 donated to Seattle Public Schools.<br/></p>
<p>If I raise more than that I will make larger posters 18""x 24""<br/></p>
<p>$1,000 raised = @4,000 printed posters (18"" x 24"") retail* for $20 = $16,000<br/></p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I'm not a fan of facebook, but I know it helps spread the word and makes
 it a simple way that people can spread the word and let others know 
about important and interesting things that are happening whether they 
are just here in Seattle or around the world. Still thinking about Egypt
 and how millions of people made a peaceful demonstration change a 
regime and how it really just started with a facebook page. So please 
spread the word and once the presses start rolling I'll update my blog 
with status as well. So I am hoping that you can help. Knowing that even
 $10 donation will help in the long run. Just donating money is not where I hope it ends. Spread the word about the posters and where the proceeds are going, because the only way I can reach my donation goals is to sell the posters an each poster will be even better than the first one. Collector's items and wonderful images for you, your family and your friends. <br/></p>
</div></div>","My Story

		I am a Seattle painter, calligrapher and writer. I create paintings 
with my own calligraphy. I also teach calligraphy classes and have been 
disappointed to hear that many area schools are no longer teaching 
cursive writing - and some have had to cut their art curriculum. I'd 
like to be able to donate money to Seattle Public Schools to help 
increase their arts programs, as I know it's the first thing being cut 
which to me is the soul of childhood - being able to create and make art
 was one of the best parts of my childhood.

		I heard about IndieGoGo as a way to raise money, while listening to a 
segment on Good Morning America. One of the ideas I had was to donate a 
portion of sales of my posters to schools, but in order to do this I 
need some funding to get posters printed and apparently IndiGoGo is 
exactly the sort of program to help spread the word and raise funds to 
make my dream come true.

		My current series deals with SOUL. Everything that is inside us that wants and needs to get out. Starting with Alphabet for the Soul
 I want to print this series of posters. I'm calling it The Souls 
Project and will donate 20% of my poster sales to The Seattle Public 
School system. I already have several other paintings ready in my series
 - one with alphabet letters, one with a colorful design with 
numbers and yes a wonderful painting I have about quotes I've collected about teaching. I am a prolific painter - only being held back by limited funds
 for art supplies and printing costs. Nothing new and different to 
anyone who is an artist. I started by business back in 1996 as One Heart
 Studio - because I was doing my heart's desire, but also it's a 
reflection of us all as being part of one world.


The Impact

		I don't know what the impact will be. I've always wanted to help 
support my local schools and give back to the community, but having a 
limited income as an artist has always made it incredibly hard. When you
 start talking about soul - it is everyone's soul that I hope will be 
affected by this project - it's the words on the paintings I have 
created, it's the colors of the paint, it's the heart and soul that I 
put into every piece I create. But it's also the little souls that will 
get to blossom and grow through art programs in their schools. I just 
can't even imagine all the possibilities this project will create for 
future generations.


What I Need & What You Get
I will use the funds collected on IndieGoGo for printing services and I 
will sell the posters online as well as in retail galleries throughout 
the United States. 20% of the proceeds from sales of these posters will

published artist with many images already being licensed, but I want 
this to be my personal project that helps my own block, my own 
neighborhood, my own city. That's where I want it to start. 

$   500 raised  = @3,000 printed posters (11"" x 17"") sold at $10 retail* each = $6000 donated to Seattle Public Schools.
If I raise more than that I will make larger posters 18""x 24""
$1,000 raised = @4,000 printed posters (18"" x 24"") retail* for $20 = $16,000
$2,000 raised = @ 10,000 printed posters (18"" x 24"") retail$ for $20 = $40,000
any posters sold at wholesale rate to galleries/shops/stores will sell for 50% of retail, but 20% of that amount will still be donated to Seattle Public Schools by me.

<p><i>For decades, one of the largest human rights injustices, was never publicly acknowledged. Even now, we don’t know their stories- who were they and where were they from?</i></p>
<p>From 1932-1945, hundreds of thousands of women were enslaved by the Japanese military into forced prostitution. Thousands of brothels, or “comfort stations” were constructed throughout Asia and Southeast Asia. Women were kidnapped, tricked, and sold into slavery- replaced as they died. Though Chinese and Korean women made up a large percentage of the women, at least 10% were poor Japanese women. Thousands more were Southeast Asia women, and several hundred were women of European descent. 90% of these women died before the end of World War II. The “comfort stations” continued to operate with/in the US military for another year afterward. There are very few survivors.</p>
<p>After the end of WWII, Japanese officials destroyed all related documents on the system. We no longer have a record of these women- but we refuse to let their stories die. Though many brave women have stepped forward to tell their story, there has been active, systematic efforts by the Japanese government and right wing organizations to downplay and erase these crimes. Our goal is to spread global awareness on this issue- and give voices to the women who suffered and died. They will not be forgotten.</p>

<p>The performance in Tokyo will be held in <strong>July</strong> at a University Campus in the form of a guerrilla performance. We are not announcing the exact time and place due to the growing concerns of possible threat and attacks from anti-movements.<br/><br/>If you want to attend the performance in Tokyo, please contact Ho Jong-suk for the up-to-date information.<br/>j.ho(at)tomorrowgirlstroop.com<br/>You need to donate more than $27 here in order to attend the event.  We consider this as a ticket.</p>

<p>Both performances are in collaboration with Yoshiko Shimada, a senior artist who has been long dedicated to creating anti- war art and feminist art.</p>

<p>Shimada has been performing her piece “Becoming ‘Japanese comfort’ women statue” since 2012. Through her performance, she visualize and aims to give voice to the Japanese ‘comfort’ women who has been neglected in the popular narrative of Japanese national history. So far, the performance has taken place in many locations including Yasukuni, in front of the Japanese embassy in London, in front of Japanese congress, and in Glendale park LA, where she commemorated the Victims of ‘comfort women’ in collaboration with TGT.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The artists’ performances aim to overcome the nationalism strongly engraved in the issue, and to seek solidarity beyond the boundaries between the nations in the past and the present.</p>
<p>Through this performance, we wish to educate Japanese youth through art performances, video works, photo works. Due to the intentional erasure of this history from textbooks, many Japanese people remain willfully ignorant or in denial of these crimes.</p>
<p>The forgotten history of comfort women is not one of political importance, but should be recognized as a crime against women internationally. As such, we wish to bring attention and awareness to violence against women still prevalent in the world today. In addition, we would like to create an opportunity for our audience to think about the issue of sexual violence during  wartime that continues all over the world and is not globally condemned, as observed through the still unsolved ""comfort women"" problem.</p>
<p>We at TGT, would like to realize solidarity and sisterhood across generations and countries. </p>

From 1932-1945, hundreds of thousands of women were enslaved by the Japanese military into forced prostitution. Thousands of brothels, or “comfort stations” were constructed throughout Asia and Southeast Asia. Women were kidnapped, tricked, and sold into slavery- replaced as they died. Though Chinese and Korean women made up a large percentage of the women, at least 10% were poor Japanese women. Thousands more were Southeast Asia women, and several hundred were women of European descent. 90% of these women died before the end of World War II. The “comfort stations” continued to operate with/in the US military for another year afterward. There are very few survivors.
After the end of WWII, Japanese officials destroyed all related documents on the system. We no longer have a record of these women- but we refuse to let their stories die. Though many brave women have stepped forward to tell their story, there has been active, systematic efforts by the Japanese government and right wing organizations to downplay and erase these crimes. Our goal is to spread global awareness on this issue- and give voices to the women who suffered and died. They will not be forgotten.

The Performance Plan
We are planning two performances in the coming months; one in Tokyo and one in Seoul.
The performance in Seoul will take place on Wednesday May 1st, on the coronation of the new Japanese Emperor.
The performance will take place at the site of 1385th Wednesday Demonstration, a weekly protest in Korea which has been held every Wednesday Since 1992, demanding Japan to address the Comfort Women problems.
The performance in Tokyo will be held in July at a University Campus in the form of a guerrilla performance. We are not announcing the exact time and place due to the growing concerns of possible threat and attacks from anti-movements.If you want to attend the performance in Tokyo, please contact Ho Jong-suk for the up-to-date information.j.ho(at)tomorrowgirlstroop.comYou need to donate more than $27 here in order to attend the event.  We consider this as a ticket.

Both performances are in collaboration with Yoshiko Shimada, a senior artist who has been long dedicated to creating anti- war art and feminist art.

Shimada has been performing her piece “Becoming ‘Japanese comfort’ women statue” since 2012. Through her performance, she visualize and aims to give voice to the Japanese ‘comfort’ women who has been neglected in the popular narrative of Japanese national history. So far, the performance has taken place in many locations including Yasukuni, in front of the Japanese embassy in London, in front of Japanese congress, and in Glendale park LA, where she commemorated the Victims of ‘comfort women’ in collaboration with TGT.

The Impact
The artists’ performances aim to overcome the nationalism strongly engraved in the issue, and to seek solidarity beyond the boundaries between the nations in the past and the present.
Through this performance, we wish to educate Japanese youth through art performances, video works, photo works. Due to the intentional erasure of this history from textbooks, many Japanese people remain willfully ignorant or in denial of these crimes.
The forgotten history of comfort women is not one of political importance, but should be recognized as a crime against women internationally. As such, we wish to bring attention and awareness to violence against women still prevalent in the world today. In addition, we would like to create an opportunity for our audience to think about the issue of sexual violence during  wartime that continues all over the world and is not globally condemned, as observed through the still unsolved ""comfort women"" problem.
We at TGT, would like to realize solidarity and sisterhood across generations and countries.

<p>Chroma is a coloring book zine dedicated to letting others color for the sake of fun! Based around the general theme of magic, each artist involved has been commissioned to draw their interpretation of the word ""Magic"". </p>
<p>The zine consists of 20<b> </b>unique lineart pieces that each backer is encouraged to color and share with their interpretation of the original artist's vision. We believe that both color and lineart are equally important for a piece - in that changes to either can drastically alter the final image. It's always interesting to see an artist have their own interpretation of another artist's vision. It allows both artists to appreciate the art from new angles.</p>

Any extra money we raise goes straight back into the zine. The goal we've set is what we need to break even on the project so that all the artists get paid the amount desired for their services.

Because of the way we are shipping the zine, it may take a lot longer to ship depending on how many copies are sold. We also may have delays due to unexpected reasons.

<h4>Why does the zine cost that much?</h4>
<h4></h4>
<p>With the purchase of the zine, both digital and physical, you're purchasing the ability to color the artist's work. We've essentially commissioned them for not only the pieces, but the rights to those pieces as well. By most artist's standards this would normally be classed as stealing but all the artists in the zine have agreed to share their work this way for the zine. </p>
<p>This zine isn't based off of any existing IP meaning the only draw to it is the premise and our combined followings. Since we are all relatively small artists, we only have small followings. As much as we'd like to estimate that we'd sell a million copies of the zine, it just isn't realistic so we've had to be conservative in our estimates so that all the artists still get paid. It rounds out to roughly $1 per artist after tax is taken out.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>Why so few artists?</h4>
<h4></h4>
<p>Since this is our first zine in terms of production, we've wanted to keep the scope of the project low so that the risk to the artists isn't too great - having too many artists increases the required amount of copies sold. We didn't want to risk the livelihood of artists just for the sake of increasing the roster. Most of us have been involved in a zine in some shape or form in the past and we know the dangers of an inflated scope. Not to mention the nature and approach we've taken to making this coloring book as well.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>Will this be sold after the campaign ends as well?</h4>
<p>Only the digital PDF version will available to purchase after the campaign ends - it'll be put up on Gumroad and a link will be provided on the Chroma Zine social media accounts. We'd only consider reprinting the zine if we receive enough attention and  it would be economically possible to do such after the campaign ends.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4><strong style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Why is it invite only?</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>Again, we didn’t want any harm to possibly come to an artist that just wanted to apply to the zine. We’re using artists that trust us on a personal level because in the worse case scenario we can recover and they would understand. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4><strong style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Why are you using Indiegogo?</strong></h4>
<p>Indiegogo allows us to basically see our goals in real time, we know exactly how many books to print and how many PDF’s will be sold. It’s more of a safety precaution so that we don’t under or over estimate the amount of merch and books that we print in the end.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4><strong style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Where are the profits going?</strong></h4>
<p>All the profits are going to the artists that helped make the zine possible. We’re artists ourselves so we understand the need for artists to make money at the end of the day. This zine revolves around these artists allowing others to do what they will with their art so we wanted to make sure they're compensated as such.</p>
<p>Aside from profit the money for the physical copies are going to straight to printing and shipping costs. The books will pay for themselves and any profit after taxes, merch, printing, shipping, and the like will be given to the artists. The curators aren't taking any extra profits, only artists who created a piece will receive compensation. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4><strong style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">When is the physical copy being sent out?</strong></h4>
<h4></h4>
<p>It's estimated two months at the soonest after the Indiegogo finishes we’ll be sending out the printed books! We’re estimating about two or three months after simply because it’ll take around that amount of time to receive the printed copies and ship them all out. As well as all the merchandise that needs to be printed that’s going along with the books.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<strong style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">What if there are delays?</strong><p>If there are any delays then you'll have our sincerest apologies. Everything we’ve set up is set to a very detailed schedule but unexpected things will always happen. Printing might get delayed with merch, or the books might take a little longer to get fully printed. We'll keep you up to date through Indiegogo updates and the social media accounts if anything happens or changes! We just ask you to bear with us if something happens and we promise to try and give you the best backer experience possible!</p>

</div></div>","Chroma is a coloring book zine dedicated to letting others color for the sake of fun! Based around the general theme of magic, each artist involved has been commissioned to draw their interpretation of the word ""Magic"". 
The zine consists of 20 unique lineart pieces that each backer is encouraged to color and share with their interpretation of the original artist's vision. We believe that both color and lineart are equally important for a piece - in that changes to either can drastically alter the final image. It's always interesting to see an artist have their own interpretation of another artist's vision. It allows both artists to appreciate the art from new angles.

<p>Le Laboratoire théâtre est, comme son nom l'indique, un lieu d'essai, de création et d'exploration pour artistes de tous horizons. Il s'est donné pour mandat de donner une voix à ceux qu'on n'entend jamais, les laissés pour contre. Dans<a href=""https://laboratoiretheatre.com/gunshot-de-lulla-west-2011/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Gunshot de Lulla West</a> (2011), on assiste à la décente aux enfers d'un frère et d'une soeur musiciens sur la côte qui peinent à survivre de leur art dans une société où les emplois manquent et la pèche est en perte de vitesse.<a href=""https://laboratoiretheatre.com/nouvelle-creation-le-trou/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Le Trou</a> (2014) révèle une jeune femme, Sara-Lee, enfermée dans son sous-sol par crainte du monde extérieur, qui essaie de sauver son village à la suite de la fermeture de l'usine locale. <a href=""https://laboratoiretheatre.com/simone-et-le-whole-shebang/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Simone et le whole shebang </a>parle de deux personnes âgées en perte d'autonomie qui tentent de trouver un peu de dignité dans un lieu où tout les oublie. </p>
<p>Oui, le théâtre du Laboratoire est engagé et ses spectacles ont toujours une touche de fraicheur, un bel humour et un langage coloré. Faire découvrir un univers unique et ludique reste l'une de ses priorités. </p>
<p>Le Laboratoire théâtre a eu une excellente <a href=""https://laboratoiretheatre.com/medias-2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">revue de presse</a> pour ses deux premiers spectacles. Obtenir votre appui serait un atout de taille pour poursuivre son mandat. C'est un moyen de soutenir la culture et de s'immerger dans un univers qui suscite la discussion. </p>

Nous avons besoin d'un modeste montant (2000$) afin de compléter notre budget de production pour assurer aux membres de la production d'être payés adéquatement, puisque pour le Laboratoire théâtre, les conditions de travail des artistes est une priorité. 
Nous vous offrons un partenariat financier et une visibilité dans notre programme, sur nos affiches et notre cartes postales (qui seront distribués à de nombreux endroits stratégiques de la ville). Nous vous offrons également la chance de gagner des paires de billets afin d'assister à notre spectacle. 




L'impact
Le Laboratoire théâtre est, comme son nom l'indique, un lieu d'essai, de création et d'exploration pour artistes de tous horizons. Il s'est donné pour mandat de donner une voix à ceux qu'on n'entend jamais, les laissés pour contre. Dans Gunshot de Lulla West (2011), on assiste à la décente aux enfers d'un frère et d'une soeur musiciens sur la côte qui peinent à survivre de leur art dans une société où les emplois manquent et la pèche est en perte de vitesse. Le Trou (2014) révèle une jeune femme, Sara-Lee, enfermée dans son sous-sol par crainte du monde extérieur, qui essaie de sauver son village à la suite de la fermeture de l'usine locale. Simone et le whole shebang parle de deux personnes âgées en perte d'autonomie qui tentent de trouver un peu de dignité dans un lieu où tout les oublie. 
Oui, le théâtre du Laboratoire est engagé et ses spectacles ont toujours une touche de fraicheur, un bel humour et un langage coloré. Faire découvrir un univers unique et ludique reste l'une de ses priorités. 
Le Laboratoire théâtre a eu une excellente revue de presse pour ses deux premiers spectacles. Obtenir votre appui serait un atout de taille pour poursuivre son mandat. C'est un moyen de soutenir la culture et de s'immerger dans un univers qui suscite la discussion.

Forbidden from the cities, jewish communities lived a rural existence. In its heyday there were some 200 synagogues dotted around the idyllic countryside often in far flung places.</p><p>Following destruction by the Nazis or through natural degradation when communities disappeared, only a fraction still stand, almost none still function. Despite being shot at, looted and set alight, Reichshoffen synagogue, the host for this project, is one of the few that remain.</p><p>Through art, this ambitious project seeks to inject a new lease of life into the building. It will be a large scale art installation exhibition constructed specifically for this site that responds in close harmony with the building’s history, context, character and its energy. Using sculpture, light and movement, it will take over and transform the entire inside space turning it into a place for reflection, question and connection. In particular it will interplay and react to the striking stained glass windows, stone carvings and other original relics still found within creating an overall sense of timelessness and awe.</p><p>Most people, including locals are unaware of its history, its relevance and even its existence. This project seeks to change that. The building’s architecture  embraces Muslim, Christian and Jewish traditions; an important reminder of diversity in an area now largely dominated by the far right.</p><p>It will also allow a rural population to engage with a museum quality contemporary art installation which can only normally be accessed in the metropolitan cities.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507022666/ncpyfb7ddiqckrwoawu8.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>An award winning proposal</strong></p><p>In February 2017, the project won the prize for best project proposal at the prestigious contemporary arts award  ""La Dînée"" in Strasbourg, France. The initiative was recommended by a number of high-profile curators and gallery directors. The project is also currently supported by the Consistoire Israélite du Bas Rhin, the Grand Est district and arts organisation Accélérateur de Particules.</p><p><strong>How the money will be spent</strong></p><p>This is a not for profit project that depends solely on the passion and energy of those involved. There are of course many costs involved with an ambitious project on this scale and where protecting the historical and delicate nature of the building is vital.  As well as the exhibition costs (materials, transport, technical assistance, production, fabrication, publicity, printing),   your contribution will also go a really long way to help the abandoned building welcome the exhibition by installing elements like electricity and lighting.</p><p>Any excess funds will go towards the production of an educational video that will accompany the exhibition.</p><p>The exhibition is due to start in March 2018 and expected to last six months. As well as welcoming the public to experience the exhibition it will also be accompanied by school visits, educational programs, guided tours, conferences, artist symposiums and an exhibition catalogue.</p><p><strong>Perks</strong></p><p>If you would like to be a part of this project then a sheynam dank !.

My name is Ben Jack Nash and I am a British visual artist based in my studio in Strasbourg, France. I work in sculpture and installation and exhibit both nationally and internationally. My work has been selected for a number of art prizes, commissions and included in exhibitions curated by well-known artists and museum directors in places such as the Venice Arsenale, London, Copenhagen and New York.I am thrilled to be able to work on this really important and exciting project which is going to push my practise to its outer most limits. So, please join me and be a part of it too!About the projectDue to start in March 2018, this campaign is for a large scale and ambitious art exhibition that will revive a rural abandoned synagogue putting it back on the map.For over a thousand years, French Alsace in eastern France wan an epicentre for Jewish life giving rise to the famous Yiddish language ""Jeddisch-Daitch"" and even foie gras. Forbidden from the cities, jewish communities lived a rural existence. In its heyday there were some 200 synagogues dotted around the idyllic countryside often in far flung places.Following destruction by the Nazis or through natural degradation when communities disappeared, only a fraction still stand, almost none still function. Despite being shot at, looted and set alight, Reichshoffen synagogue, the host for this project, is one of the few that remain.Through art, this ambitious project seeks to inject a new lease of life into the building. It will be a large scale art installation exhibition constructed specifically for this site that responds in close harmony with the building’s history, context, character and its energy. Using sculpture, light and movement, it will take over and transform the entire inside space turning it into a place for reflection, question and connection. In particular it will interplay and react to the striking stained glass windows, stone carvings and other original relics still found within creating an overall sense of timelessness and awe.Most people, including locals are unaware of its history, its relevance and even its existence. This project seeks to change that. The building’s architecture  embraces Muslim, Christian and Jewish traditions; an important reminder of diversity in an area now largely dominated by the far right.It will also allow a rural population to engage with a museum quality contemporary art installation which can only normally be accessed in the metropolitan cities.An award winning proposalIn February 2017, the project won the prize for best project proposal at the prestigious contemporary arts award  ""La Dînée"" in Strasbourg, France. The initiative was recommended by a number of high-profile curators and gallery directors. The project is also currently supported by the Consistoire Israélite du Bas Rhin, the Grand Est district and arts organisation Accélérateur de Particules.How the money will be spentThis is a not for profit project that depends solely on the passion and energy of those involved. There are of course many costs involved with an ambitious project on this scale and where protecting the historical and delicate nature of the building is vital.  As well as the exhibition costs (materials, transport, technical assistance, production, fabrication, publicity, printing),   your contribution will also go a really long way to help the abandoned building welcome the exhibition by installing elements like electricity and lighting.Any excess funds will go towards the production of an educational video that will accompany the exhibition.The exhibition is due to start in March 2018 and expected to last six months. As well as welcoming the public to experience the exhibition it will also be accompanied by school visits, educational programs, guided tours, conferences, artist symposiums and an exhibition catalogue.PerksIf you would like to be a part of this project then a sheynam dank !. That means thank you very much in Jeddisch Daitch.There are some really great rewards including stunning limited edition prints of the inside of the synagogue taken by the artist, Raymond Levi and film maker Hélène Lücke. At the other end of the scale there  are food hampers with local delicacies and even some famous regional ""choucroute"" up for grabs.Take a look at the image gallery below the video at the top to view the photos available. ************************************************************************************",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello!  My name’s Michaela Daystar, and I’m fundraising to become a certified SoulCollage® Facilitator. </p>
<p>From photography, to painting, to tattooing, I’ve always sought to find and express meaning in my life through art.  I’ve woven this passion into my working life by utilizing art to explore social justice with college students; and into my community life through service to art associations, as a Regional Coordinator for the Global Art Project for Peace (<a href=""http://www.globalartproject.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.globalartproject.org/</a>), and volunteering with youth in artistic settings. </p>
<p>During the six years I’ve guided the leadership development of college students through my job, I’ve developed skill and passion for teaching and mentorship.  I want to bring my passions for art, teaching and mentoring together in dynamic and life-giving ways.  I found that way with SoulCollage®.</p>
<p>Developed in the late 1980’s By Sena Frost, SoulCollage utilizes intuition, imagination and images to foster and deepen one’s understanding of and connection to the many aspects of one’s self through collage (<a href=""http://www.soulcollage/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.soulcollage</a>.com).  Using a meditative process, one creates unique  collages representing different aspects of one’s self, resulting in a deck of beautifully powerful cards.  I’ve worked with SoulCollage® in support of my own development for several months and am excited and inspired by the process—both the artist process of collaging and the deeper self-knowledge it brings. </p>
<p>From the beginning, I felt a strong desire to share this process with others.  I learned that one can become certified as a SoulCollage® Facilitator through a multi-day training, and knew right away that I needed to do this.  Taking a leap of faith that I will find the support I need, I registered for the November 2013 training.  I’m turning now to my extended community to help me make this happen!</p>
<p>Your support will help me to share this transformative process with the college students I work with, and in the many communities I move through—and if you wish, with you too!  I plan to offer workshops and classes in both the Bay Area where I work, and the Sacramento Valley where I live, to help supplement my income.  The Sacramento Valley currently has no registered SoulCollage® facilitators, so you will be helping to introduce it to a new and wider community. </p>
<p><strong>Packing My Bags</strong></p>
<p>Over the past few months, I have begun preparing for and investing in SoulCollage.  I've obtained the basic informational and training materials needed to begin creating cards and learning about the process.  I've also participated in on-line forums and trainings on various aspects of SoulCollage, and have arranged to practice facilitating SoulCollage groups in the fall.  These experiences have convinced me to take the next steps of formal training, and to request support to make it happen.</p>
<p>My fundraising goal is $2,500, which will be used for:</p>
<p>--The cost of the facilitator training, training materials/books and travel to the training location  (aprox. $1,500)</p>
<p>--A business license to allow me to offer SoulCollage® workshops and classes ($100)</p>
<p>--Materials needed to begin holding workshops (aprox. $ 800)</p>
<p>--Promotional materials ($100)</p>
<p>Of these expenses, the most critical are those directly connected with the training, so if I am unable to reach my funding goal, all funds raised will go to the training.  If I am blessed enough to exceed my goal, I will be able to attend additional on-line trainings that go deeper into specific aspects and uses of SoulCollage®.  </p>
<p><strong>Expressing My Gratitude:</strong></p>
<p>My art has always been most strongly inspired by the people in my life, and motivated by the desire to share it with them.  So I’m so excited at this opportunity to thank you for your support by creating art for you!  The list of thank you gifts to the right includes original art, and of course, the opportunity to experience the SoulCollage® process yourself.  I would be honored to offer a personalize SoulCollage® workshop for you or a group, or to make a SoulCollage® card in your honor.</p>
<p><strong>Impact and Track Record</strong></p>
<p>Through my years working with students who are passionate about social justice, and through my own exploration of myself in connection with the world, I am convinced that lasting, wide-spread peace and justice must grow from within each person, outward to the world.  We cannot love, respect, protect, and understand others until we can do these things for ourselves.  Thus I wish to contribute to positive change in the world by challenging myself and others to love and understand the self.  SoulCollage is a powerful tool in this process.</p>
<p>While SoulCollage® is new and exciting territory for me, I am well prepared for the journey, and will make good use of the support you give.  Below is a partial list of projects I have designed and successfully carried out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design and facilitation of three workshops with groups participating in the Global Art Project for Peace, 2012 (<a href=""http://www.globalartproject.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.globalartproject.org</a>)</li>

<p>Founded in 2010, <b>Make Studio</b> is a 501(c)3 organization located in <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Baltimore, MD (<a href=""www.make-studio.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.make-studio.org</a>).

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<p>Our program artists with disabilities <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">are supported in pursuing greater self-sufficiency, community connectedness, and well-being. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">One artist’s parent said the following about how the studio program has impacted her young </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">adult son:</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><b>He now realizes how his art can not only be a source of joy for him, but </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">a source of joy for others, as well as a source of income. This revelation </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">has caused him to enhance his socialization skills, assess his work ethic, </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">and become more of a positive thinker around employment.

<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">With the starting premise of offering high-quality and meaningful arts programming for </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><i>individuals</i>, we opened the doors to our first studio in the now defunct Load of Fun building in </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">the Station North Arts District.

<p><b></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/988803/files/20141105095424-make_schwing_final.jpg?1415210064"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>Make Studio @ Schwing</b>, which will allow us to immediately grow our studio program for adult artists with disabilities (from 23 up to 35 within a year). But, excitingly, it also gives us the opportunity to establish an art center to serve Baltimoreans of all abilities through events and activities (e.g., community art-making, workshops, lectures, etc.).</p>
<p><b>Our goal is to create a gathering place for making art, connections, &amp; community!</b> It will be:</p> <ul> <li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>An attractive, versatile, and functional space</b> for participating artists, staff, visitors, and </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">volunteers in which to carry out the mission of Make Studio;</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>A community asset for its neighborhood</b>, available to </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">nearby residents, community organizations, nonprofit organizations, and others;</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>A resource for the Baltimore area arts community</b>, providing a new venue for </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">collaborations, community-based learning, and for making and showing exceptional art.</span>
</li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></h3>
<h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We need your help to make this happen!</span><br/>
</h3> <p>In a stroke of good luck, just as Make Studio started to <i>really</i> feel the crush of our current space (1,000 sq ft), we discovered that the Schwing Motor Co. Building (close to 5,000 sq ft) was available. AND, we found it that it was <i>exactly</i> the size, configuration, and location, with visibility and accessibility, needed to carry us into the future!</p>
<p><i>Not so good</i> is that the window for us to make this move is narrow. Schwing's a unique building, in a unique spot, and it's uniquely desirable. As our long-time fans know, the last time we moved it was not by choice - now, although we don't want to rush, this opportunity to get into our dream space has essentially fallen into our laps and we're choosing to take it. But we will lose it if we don't take occupancy by <b>January 1, 2015</b>!</p>
<p>To expand into a space of such a greater size, on relatively short notice, will increase expenses exponentially in the short-term. W<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">e need <b>your help</b> to cover the temporary gap between our income and expenses, and to set up our new gallery space.</span></p>
<p>Your support will go <b>directly </b>towards:</p> <ul> <li>Covering the difference between our current space costs and those at Schwing (i.e., rent, utilities)</li> <li>Fitting out the gallery with moveable walls and retail displays, and installing exterior signage</li> <li>Operating costs that are new to us, that we'll encounter in having our own building (e.g., HVAC maintenance, internet service)</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></h3>
<h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Why this move matters</span><br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Make Studio is the only program of our kind in the Baltimore area. </b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Within and beyond our studio Make </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Studio educates the public about the abilities and creative potential of underrepresented and </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">marginalized populations. By bringing together diverse members of the local arts community </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">and showcasing fresh artistic perspectives, we help to dispel pervasive and destructive </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">stereotypes to create positive, radiating impacts in our local communities and beyond.</span><br/></p>
<p>Even in our smaller digs, we've been able to reach hundreds <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">of individuals annually via activities in our own studio, and many more indirectly through our </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">online presence and activities in the community. <b>Imagine what we can do in a bigger, better space!</b></span></p>With thoughtful modifications, our present space has <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">served us well. However, it cannot keep pace with the amount of </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">referrals we receive for our studio program. (We can serve 7-8 participating artists </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">on a workday right now; interest in our program indicates that we should be serving 12-15.) </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We've been very creative in making overlapping use of the <i>same space for creation, </i></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><i>exhibition, and outreach activities</i>; however, this sharply limits what we can </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">offer and our ability to sell artwork. Furthermore, we're now located up an </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">elevator and down a long hallway from an entrance, making us difficult to locate for visitors and </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">transportation providers (often relied upon by our participating artists).</span>
</div><div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></div><div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our current space is </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">barely</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> adequate for our needs as they are now, and will be lesser so in the near future, as we further our vision of promoting inclusivity via diverse artistic offerings for the community-at-large</span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">. In sum, Make Studio needs new quarters.</b>
</div><div><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;""><br/></span></div><div><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">Risks &amp; Rewards</span></div><div> <p>We recognize that making such a BIG move is a risky endeavor. Although our self-generated income, <i>which will grow as we grow</i>, will largely cover our expenses once we're established at Schwing, it could take us longer than we anticipate to grow it enough to cover the gap. We also know that there will be growing pains along the way, not only in moving and setting up the new space, but related to expanding our community activities.</p>
<p>However, over the last 4 years, we've demonstrated <b>our track record of sustainable growth</b>, and our ability to mindfully balance risk with reward. Since our founding, Make Studio’s revenues have more than doubled, as expenses have stayed relatively low even as we have maintained a high level of service. </p>

<h3><b>In the words of our 1st artist and Star Trek superfan, Jerry ""Partyman"" Williams: Let's MAKE IT SO!</b></h3>
</div></div>","When we say ""Schwing!"" we don't mean what you think we mean.... Make Studio has the opportunity to move into the historic Schwing Motor Co. Building in Hampden, just in time for our 5th anniversary!






Founded in 2010, Make Studio is a 501(c)3 organization located in Baltimore, MD (www.make-studio.org). Through exhibitions, outreach, and in-studio services for artists with disabilities, we aim to put art and abilities to work to create more inclusive communities for all. 

Our program artists with disabilities are supported in pursuing greater self-sufficiency, community connectedness, and well-being. One artist’s parent said the following about how the studio program has impacted her young adult son:
He now realizes how his art can not only be a source of joy for him, but a source of joy for others, as well as a source of income. This revelation has caused him to enhance his socialization skills, assess his work ethic, and become more of a positive thinker around employment. How does the saying go — ‘Love what you do and you will never have to work a day in your life'

With the starting premise of offering high-quality and meaningful arts programming for individuals, we opened the doors to our first studio in the now defunct Load of Fun building in the Station North Arts District. Since then, as we’ve grown, we have increased our efforts to serve communities. Which leads us to...


Make Studio @ Schwing, which will allow us to immediately grow our studio program for adult artists with disabilities (from 23 up to 35 within a year). But, excitingly, it also gives us the opportunity to establish an art center to serve Baltimoreans of all abilities through events and activities (e.g., community art-making, workshops, lectures, etc.).
Our goal is to create a gathering place for making art, connections, & community! It will be:  
An attractive, versatile, and functional space for participating artists, staff, visitors, and volunteers in which to carry out the mission of Make Studio;


A community asset for its neighborhood, available to nearby residents, community organizations, nonprofit organizations, and others;


A resource for the Baltimore area arts community, providing a new venue for collaborations, community-based learning, and for making and showing exceptional art.

   

We need your help to make this happen!
 In a stroke of good luck, just as Make Studio started to really feel the crush of our current space (1,000 sq ft), we discovered that the Schwing Motor Co. Building (close to 5,000 sq ft) was available. AND, we found it that it was exactly the size, configuration, and location, with visibility and accessibility, needed to carry us into the future!
Not so good is that the window for us to make this move is narrow. Schwing's a unique building, in a unique spot, and it's uniquely desirable. As our long-time fans know, the last time we moved it was not by choice - now, although we don't want to rush, this opportunity to get into our dream space has essentially fallen into our laps and we're choosing to take it. But we will lose it if we don't take occupancy by January 1, 2015!
To expand into a space of such a greater size, on relatively short notice, will increase expenses exponentially in the short-term. We need your help to cover the temporary gap between our income and expenses, and to set up our new gallery space.
Your support will go directly towards:  Covering the difference between our current space costs and those at Schwing (i.e., rent, utilities) Fitting out the gallery with moveable walls and retail displays, and installing exterior signage Operating costs that are new to us, that we'll encounter in having our own building (e.g., HVAC maintenance, internet service)    

Why this move matters
 

Make Studio is the only program of our kind in the Baltimore area. Within and beyond our studio Make Studio educates the public about the abilities and creative potential of underrepresented and marginalized populations. By bringing together diverse members of the local arts community and showcasing fresh artistic perspectives, we help to dispel pervasive and destructive stereotypes to create positive, radiating impacts in our local communities and beyond.
Even in our smaller digs, we've been able to reach hundreds of individuals annually via activities in our own studio, and many more indirectly through our online presence and activities in the community. Imagine what we can do in a bigger, better space!With thoughtful modifications, our present space has served us well. However, it cannot keep pace with the amount of referrals we receive for our studio program. (We can serve 7-8 participating artists on a workday right now; interest in our program indicates that we should be serving 12-15.) We've been very creative in making overlapping use of the same space for creation, exhibition, and outreach activities; however, this sharply limits what we can offer and our ability to sell artwork. Furthermore, we're now located up an elevator and down a long hallway from an entrance, making us difficult to locate for visitors and transportation providers (often relied upon by our participating artists).

Our current space is barely adequate for our needs as they are now, and will be lesser so in the near future, as we further our vision of promoting inclusivity via diverse artistic offerings for the community-at-large. In sum, Make Studio needs new quarters.
Risks & Rewards We recognize that making such a BIG move is a risky endeavor. Although our self-generated income, which will grow as we grow, will largely cover our expenses once we're established at Schwing, it could take us longer than we anticipate to grow it enough to cover the gap. We also know that there will be growing pains along the way, not only in moving and setting up the new space, but related to expanding our community activities.
However, over the last 4 years, we've demonstrated our track record of sustainable growth, and our ability to mindfully balance risk with reward. Since our founding, Make Studio’s revenues have more than doubled, as expenses have stayed relatively low even as we have maintained a high level of service. 
We're still a small and growing organization, but we possess many strengths in the areas of program design and internal evaluation, leadership and governance, and community relationships with great human services and arts partners. Together, these contribute to our capacity to successfully establish our art center. 
With your support to get us in the door, we will immediately open that door to new participating artists, looking to make art, and to visitors, looking to buy art and take part in a full calendar of activities.   

Other Ways You Can Help
 If you are unable to give financially to this effort, we'd still appreciate your support!  Let your circle know that Make Studio is growing, and we're looking for new fans, community partners, and participating artists with disabilities to join our fold.
Please spread the word about this campaign far and wide! It's very easy to do that with Indiegogo's share tools! Spread the word to your favorite, charitably-minded local business -- sponsorships, with naming opportunities, are available.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Michigan Artisans was born out of the desire of two designers and artisans to have quality representation and opportunities to sell their products. After attending several art fair shows that were ill fit for our products, disorganized or misrepresented, we realized that this idea needed to become a reality. While art fairs and craft shows used to be the best place for artisans to display and sell their goods, in the recent years it has become more of a “flea market” or “swap meet” atmosphere not suited to artists and craftsmen.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Artists tend to know how to create their craft well, but not how to market it, where to sell it or how to design a professional website. This is where Michigan Artisans began in the online format (<a href=""http://www.michigan-artisans.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.michigan-artisans.org</a>). We are both well versed in website design and bring unique attributes to the company from our collective backgrounds. The company is at the stage now where it would like to expand and start to provide a representation service to these artists as well as a gallery space to showcase these artists and their crafts. We represent only artists from the Great Lakes State, promoting Michigan and what it has to offer.<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Michigan Artisans juries all members of their website community with strict guidelines. Members will be reviewed with a checks and balance system once approved. This keeps the quality of products high as well as a growing variety of new artists. These online vendors will also have the option to join Michigan Artisans in our Gallery Boutique. This helps the company with connecting local artists with the community.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The main goal of the company is connecting artists and designers with the community and the community with local art. Michigan Artisans focuses on quality handmade products from within our state while helping local artists by providing them with the support needed to improve their own businesses. The variety of services offered by Michigan Artisans goes beyond an online community of artists. Aside from the actual storefront to sell vendors’ goods, Michigan Artisans will offer graphic support to artists and the local community, reasonable studio and display space rental fees, event planning services and eventually offer graphic internships to students. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We would like the company to be seen by local artists as a trusted partner for marketing and selling their goods and products. Michigan Artisans would also be seen as a trusted community member and a place to help local community groups plan and organize events. Overall we want the company to be a profitable business that can hold its own in the arts community and will help encourage growth within the community and in local businesses. <br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We really feel that Michigan Artisans needs to take our business to the next level. By moving into a physical space to set up our studio &amp; gallery area we believe that we can be more productive and more available to the community. What we lack is the funding to expand into the preferred space and set up shop. A physical presence in the community will keep our plan viable and transparent. Our start-up costs will go toward move-in costs, office equipment, display units, signage and advertising. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Patrons and Angels for our cause will receive a Michigan Artisans Art Supporter t-shirt ($50 donation) or sweatshirt ($100 or more donation) in their choice of size plus an invitation to our exclusive Grand Opening Gala.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In the event we don't meet our goal within the time period provided, we will continue other fund raising and work to meet that goal in a timely fashion. All of our fund raising efforts will be kept current on the website.<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Everybody knows somebody that would like to support the arts! We are trying to keep Michigan moving forward in economic growth and community arts development. If you don't have any disposable income for a donation you can still spread the word and BUY LOCAL, BUY MICHIGAN.<br/></p>

I closed the fund raising campaign for Wearable Weapons early.  Things went in a different direction. I got the funding I was seeking. All the clarity I gained and 
late nights spent refining this proposal was used to receive the Eyebeam
 Residency + Stipend that begins September 1st, 2011 through January 
2012.  
I am very excited and grateful to begin this new adventure.  Please follow this project at wearableweapons.com  or through the Eyebeam website updates!

**********************************************************************

 
Who are these participants? and what will they do?


These senior citizens are long-time residents of one of New York City's Lower East Side public housing developments.


Some participants will carve, sculpt, and paint 'memory tiles' that they design, to show their favorite Lower East Side memories.


Some will press clay into specially made plaster molds to create a row of 'water tiles' to represent their families' immigration to New York City.


Some will make border tiles by stamping textures and symbols into damp clay tiles.


All will be invited to share their wishes for the future of the neighborhood. I will represent these hopes in the tiles that I will create for this installation.

Who I am: 

I am a ceramic artist named Syma living in New York City's Lower East Side. My studio workspace is in Brooklyn.
My two passions are working with clay and working with people.
Currently I am a freelance educator for the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
As visiting artist or artist-in-residence, I have helped New York City and Boston area students create hand-made clay tiles for permanent installations in their schools.
I have worked with architects and interior designers to design and create low-relief panels and tiles that are installed in public buildings and private homes.
Why I dreamed up this project:

This project offers me the chance to put my art-making and my art-teaching passions together in my own community.
Funding no longer exists for the pottery program that I directed from 1998-2002 for these seniors, at the Hamilton Madison Community Center.
I am excited by the challenge of making art that reflects some of the hopes and dreams these elders hold for their neighborhood.
I want to combine my artwork with the tiles created by the community participants; to integrate the parts into a cohesive, meaningful, visually compelling permanent installation.
I think that public art can not only tell a story about the community,  it can actually involve members of the community in which the art is placed.
 Why we need your help:


The 'Memories and Wishes' project has received some government funding.* This grant award will not cover all of the costs.
We need additional financial help to be able to cover costs for time and materials for all of the tile-making and tile-painting workshops; kiln-firings; and the tile installation in the community center lobby.
Without additional funding, there will be no actual clay tile-making. A few seniors will be able to simply decorate store-bought pre-made tiles that will be hung in the lobby.
Please let this project be all that it can be.

What will your donation fund?  

Your donation will allow us to enhance the lobby of the Hamilton Madison Community Center that provides activities for area residents of all ages.
Every contribution will allow us to involve more of the interested elders.
Every dollar helps.
A donation of $25 pays for the materials and time for one senior to make 1/4 of their memory tile.
You will give these elders the chance to tell their stories in clay.
You will give these elders the chance to leave a legacy for the future.
You can receive gifts for yourself or your friends from our list of 'perks'.
Other ways you can help even if you cannot donate money:

We value your assistance even if you cannot donate any money.
You can participate by helping us to spread the word about this project and about this fund-raising campaign.

<p align=""center""><strong>MANABIGAMA translates from Japanese as ""a beautiful learning kiln""</strong></p>
<p>Designed by potter, John Thies, this type of kiln was chosen for the qualities it lends to the workshop setting. The manabigama is a very efficient kiln, using about 3/4 of a cord of wood to achieve the same beautiful results as traditional firings consuming 3-5 cords of wood. With a 30 cubic foot chamber we can fire lots of artwork, yet this medium sized kiln is not overwhelming for the student new to wood firing. The fired results are sure to please serious professionals proficient at this craft.  </p>
<p>Weighing about six tons, this kiln will be a permanent fixture in Tyler State Park, lasting for years and experienced by many. Students from high schools and colleges, professional artists, and adult students will come from all over our region to participate in this oldest form of firing.</p>
<p>With generous support from individuals, and intrigued approval from the State Park Commission and Newtown Township we laid the foundation for this fascinating kiln. We are fortunate to have government entities sharing our belief that this project is a valued addition to the park atmosphere and surrounding communities!</p>
<p>We will be firing up to 2400 degrees by stoking a flame every ten minutes for 12-16 hours.  Stoneware and porcelain clays will reach a temperature where they become somewhat molten.  It is then that ash from the burning embers travels through the kiln and sticks to the pottery.  Wood ash containing silica melts at high temperatures and forms a glass like surface on areas of the ware inside the kiln.  Where the ash does not land the flame touches up against the clay leaving its mark.  It is a chosen aesthetic unreachable through any other method.</p>

<p><strong>WE HAVE ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED SO MUCH!</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p>We need to raise an additional amount of $8,500 to pay for the kiln shelves, angle iron, mortar, ceramic fiber insulation, clay, glaze, and a much needed log splitter. If you help us exceed our goal you will be contributing to our kiln scholarship fund.  In scholarship, we could provide opportunities to deserving underserved students, local teachers, and emerging artists.</p>
<p>To many community art centers, a kiln of this magnitude would be cost prohibitive with final costs approaching $25,000.  We started with a pledge from a local artist, a pile of repurposed bricks, and very hard working volunteers.  Our dreams are within reach! </p>
<p>Support of our project will be far reaching.  You will help ensure the longevity of our art center as this permanent kiln will be a source of revenue for many years to come.  In helping us you also bring job opportunities to regional artists and opportunities for creative expression to our local population.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am Raffaela Vergata. I have been working in theatre in New York City for the past 5 years. My friends approached me a few months ago with the idea of going to an arts festival in Nevada called Burning man. I had never heard of it but after learning about all the different art that is produced there and the great energy everyone has, I knew I had to be there. </p>
<p>Burning man encourages everyone to contribute to the festival. This can mean helping others with their project or bringing your own. I chose to bring my own after hearing the theme for the festival this year is fertility. I was full of ideas but chose to design a field of sixty sunflowers for the occasion. </p>
<p>My intention is to bring life back to the dessert. The sunflowers will be constructed of 3/8"" and 1/4"" steel rods, 3/4"" plastic tubing, colored plastic sheets called Gel (usually used in theatrical lighting) and strings of tiny LED lights to illuminate the flowers at night. The thinner rods will be bent into circles for the flowers heads while the thicker pieces are left straight to represent the flower stems. The plastic tubing acts as a cover for the lights as well as a way to attach the ""petals"" to the heads.

</div></div>","Short Summary
I am Raffaela Vergata. I have been working in theatre in New York City for the past 5 years. My friends approached me a few months ago with the idea of going to an arts festival in Nevada called Burning man. I had never heard of it but after learning about all the different art that is produced there and the great energy everyone has, I knew I had to be there. 
Burning man encourages everyone to contribute to the festival. This can mean helping others with their project or bringing your own. I chose to bring my own after hearing the theme for the festival this year is fertility. I was full of ideas but chose to design a field of sixty sunflowers for the occasion. 
My intention is to bring life back to the dessert. The sunflowers will be constructed of 3/8"" and 1/4"" steel rods, 3/4"" plastic tubing, colored plastic sheets called Gel (usually used in theatrical lighting) and strings of tiny LED lights to illuminate the flowers at night. The thinner rods will be bent into circles for the flowers heads while the thicker pieces are left straight to represent the flower stems. The plastic tubing acts as a cover for the lights as well as a way to attach the ""petals"" to the heads. The gel sheets will be cut into petal-like shapes and then attached to flower head rings. 
The ""field"" will be laid out in a 30'x40' grid. The field will allow participants of Burning Man to walk among the flowers and enjoy the way they play with light. With the hollow heads and colored petals, they will cast long stain glass-like patterns on the dessert. 
I have a great team going with me; Jake Platt, Desiree Burch, Kyle Crose and Patrick Rule. As well as all the flower assembly help at home, this belongs to all of you. 
 


What We Need & What You Get
I am looking to raise $5,000 for materials. The flowers design has been kept as simple as possible but the steel, tubing, gel and lights, still need to be covered.
For a donation or $25 you will receive a thank you card from artist and team. 
For a donation of $50 you can receive a sunflower rendering.
For a donation of $100 you will receive a sunflower of your very own.
For a donation of $300 you will receive an original sunflower, after the festival, with a letter of authenticity from the artist. 
If the entire goal is reached my team and I will head out to the Burning Man festival in a truck packed with the beautiful sunflowers. We will have a day of setup before the festival gates open to all participants, I will spend the week at Burning Man promoting the sunflowers and talking to others about the process. If the goal is not reached however, I will probably have to abandon the project behind.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is Patricia Watts, and I am an independent art curator specializing in art and ecology since 1994. In 1997, I founded ecoartspace, an art and nature center concept in development, and in 1999, was joined by Amy Lipton in New York City. Together we have created a nonprofit bicoastal platform for artists addressing environmental issues, and have curated more than 40 exhibitions, 75 programs, and have worked with more than 400 artists and collaborated with more than 150 organizations. </p>

<p><span>My name is </span><a href=""http://www.paintingsbyrene.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Renê Nascimento</a><span>. I am a Brazilian born artist currently residing in New York City. I have a degree from the School of Fine Arts in Minas Gerais Brazil and I have studied in renowned art centers like Parque Lage, Rio de Janeiro, FAAP, São Paulo, and The Artists League of New York. I have been fortunate enough to make a career out of my passion for painting. I have painted for several presidents and dignitaries around the world such as Brazil former president José Sarney and Minister Marcos Villaca; and my artwork has been exhibited in galleries and public spaces around the world for over 25 years. </span><a href=""http://www.paintingsbyrene.com/#!extended-bio/c1et7"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Read more about Renê's story.</a></p>

<p><strong>                                 (See larger images and descriptions of paintings below)</strong></p>
<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
<p>Our funding goal for this campaign is $10,000. By reaching our goal we will be able to add 5 more paintings to the series. For every $2,000 under our goal or past our goal we will either add or subtract 1 painting from the next set.</p>
<p>After fulfilling the perks, 10% of the funds will be donated to <a href=""http://www.peopleforbikes.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.peopleforbikes.org</a> and the remaining balance will be used for materials to continue the series and for my workspace, since I will not be painting any other commissioned work during that time.</p>
<p>We want to give everyone a chance to own a part of the series and to help with the cause, so to the right of this page you will find perks at every level</p>
<p><img alt=""Perks"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://static.wix.com/media/2cb422_c8fa6a01fa1bdf31ba53b0aeff459e35.png_650"" src="""" style=""""/><strong style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">How it All Started</strong></p>
<p>Since one of the most popular series of paintings in my 25 year career was <a href=""http://www.paintingsbyrene.com/#!bicycles/c1yk1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">NYC Bikes</a>, I did not want to just start a new series of bicycle paintings without giving back to the community that initially inspired my first series. So, I partnered with People For Bikes - the largest organization dedicated to improving the future of bicycling. Together, we ran a bicycle photo contest to find photos that I could paint for this new series. We had almost 1,000 submissions from all over the world.</p>
<p><img alt=""Winning bicycle photos"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://static.wix.com/media/2cb422_a71c530f69c34a55e16f87843ce26752.png_850"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The initial idea was to just paint 5 paintings (shown below) from the winning photos submitted and to create prints from the paintings and then donate 10% of sales back to<a href=""http://www.peopleforbikes.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> www.peopleforbikes.org</a>, but after receiving so many inspiring beautiful bicycle photos from around the world I realized I shouldn’t stop there.</p>
<h3><strong>Then it came to me...</strong></h3>
<p>the larger the series of paintings, the bigger impact we can have in bicycling communities around the world. Why stop at 5 when there are 192 countries in the world, all of which are impacted by bicycling in one way or another?</p>
<h3><strong>As a result, “Bikes Around The World” was born.</strong></h3>
<p>Each time we add to the “Bikes Around The World” series we will donate 10% of the funds raised to a different bicycle organization—for this campaign it will go to <a href=""http://www.peopleforbikes.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.peopleforbikes.org</a><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p>We now need your help to create the world’s largest series of bicycle paintings, “Bikes Around The World,” with the ultimate goal of painting at least 1 bike in each country—that’s a total of 192 paintings. We will do this through a succession of crowdfunding campaigns.  The more money we raise for each campaign, the more paintings will be added to the series. </p>

About Me

My name is Renê Nascimento. I am a Brazilian born artist currently residing in New York City. I have a degree from the School of Fine Arts in Minas Gerais Brazil and I have studied in renowned art centers like Parque Lage, Rio de Janeiro, FAAP, São Paulo, and The Artists League of New York. I have been fortunate enough to make a career out of my passion for painting. I have painted for several presidents and dignitaries around the world such as Brazil former president José Sarney and Minister Marcos Villaca; and my artwork has been exhibited in galleries and public spaces around the world for over 25 years. Read more about Renê's story.
Bikes Around The World

                                 (See larger images and descriptions of paintings below)
What We Need & What You Get
Our funding goal for this campaign is $10,000. By reaching our goal we will be able to add 5 more paintings to the series. For every $2,000 under our goal or past our goal we will either add or subtract 1 painting from the next set.
After fulfilling the perks, 10% of the funds will be donated to www.peopleforbikes.org and the remaining balance will be used for materials to continue the series and for my workspace, since I will not be painting any other commissioned work during that time.
We want to give everyone a chance to own a part of the series and to help with the cause, so to the right of this page you will find perks at every level
How it All Started
Since one of the most popular series of paintings in my 25 year career was NYC Bikes, I did not want to just start a new series of bicycle paintings without giving back to the community that initially inspired my first series. So, I partnered with People For Bikes - the largest organization dedicated to improving the future of bicycling. Together, we ran a bicycle photo contest to find photos that I could paint for this new series. We had almost 1,000 submissions from all over the world.

The initial idea was to just paint 5 paintings (shown below) from the winning photos submitted and to create prints from the paintings and then donate 10% of sales back to www.peopleforbikes.org, but after receiving so many inspiring beautiful bicycle photos from around the world I realized I shouldn’t stop there.
Then it came to me...
the larger the series of paintings, the bigger impact we can have in bicycling communities around the world. Why stop at 5 when there are 192 countries in the world, all of which are impacted by bicycling in one way or another?
As a result, “Bikes Around The World” was born.
Each time we add to the “Bikes Around The World” series we will donate 10% of the funds raised to a different bicycle organization—for this campaign it will go to www.peopleforbikes.org
We now need your help to create the world’s largest series of bicycle paintings, “Bikes Around The World,” with the ultimate goal of painting at least 1 bike in each country—that’s a total of 192 paintings. We will do this through a succession of crowdfunding campaigns.  The more money we raise for each campaign, the more paintings will be added to the series. 
“Life is a great big canvas, and you should throw all the paint you can on it.” – Danny Kaye

<p><strong>SECRET RESTAURANT</strong> is an art project by Bob Dornberger and Jim Piatt, is an aggressively marketed, 16 sq. ft partially subterranean restaurant open only a few days per year. </p>
<h3>When is it?</h3>
<p>In concert with the <a href=""http://www.highdeserttestsites.com/hdts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">High Desert Test Sites</a> 2013 Program, the project runs from Oct. 12-19 2013.</p>

<p>Diners will be forced to stoop down to get their food, and no seating will be provided. We're still working out the menu, but we are leaning toward rabbit. The unique earthen roof and camouflage techniques keep the restaurant hard to find on satellite maps, while arrow boards, night-time lighting and ‘sign flippers’ along HWY 62 bring patrons in from the street.</p>
<p>This is quite an ambitious undertaking, from hiring talented sign flippers to the custom fabrication of eye-catching signage, to the excavation of the restaurant 'building' itself.  That's why we need your help.</p>
