<p><strong>We're deeply committed to and excited about delivering a high-quality product that we know you'll enjoy for a long time to come.</strong></p>
<p>We started the Kickback Project because we volunteer with students who use digital camera-enabled devices.  The shocking truth is that just about anyone can hack into your computer and turn on the camera without you even knowing it.  The only way to guarantee your family's privacy is to cover the camera when you are not using it.  We believe that it is your space, so you should be the one to decide when your camera is being used.</p>
<p>Prior attempts at covering the webcam, like using tape (sticky residue left on the camera lens) and a post-it paper (falls off, easily repurposed) all fell short. Kickback offers a professional look and reliable durability.</p>

<p>In creating a camera shield, our first focus was to have something that looks clean and refined. The profile needed to be thin, minimal, and above all else, functional. As a result of confronting these design challenges, our product now exceeds our earlier expectations.</p>

<p align=""JUSTIFY"">How often have you looked for advice, or just needed some positive re-assurance to continue believing in yourself? Most of the time, when you do find something, it either costs a lot of money, or it's unrealistic and not applicable to you.</p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"">Here is my solution. A website that is updated daily with short Quick Tip videos on various topics, plus interviews with inspirational people world-wide - from goal setting to coping with family feuds to seeking a meaning to life. A site where this information is shared <strong>openly and freely in english</strong> and through practical tips that apply to us all. A site that is non discriminatory to any religion, creed, sex or race and that also promotes love and peace between all people everywhere.</p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"">The emphasis <strong>WILL ALWAYS</strong> be on <strong>PRACTICAL, SUSTAINABLE TIPS </strong>that we as human beings can apply in our lives.</p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY""><strong>How did the idea originate?</strong></p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"">For years I have been inspiring corporate clients throughout the world as a Change Management Inspirational Speaker. I initially started in the entertainment industry as a magician. i worked on cruise ships, in leading theatres and for big corporates, and became well known on television in South Africa. I started my career in the UK and since then have worked in <strong>over 100 countries globally</strong>. If anything, it has been a dream come true. </p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"">My parents always taught me to think differently and to follow my heart and passion in life. The majority of people I meet cannot believe that I have achieved and experienced so much from being an entertainer &amp; speaker. For me it was never about money, but following my passion and enjoying life – that has always been my definition of wealth. I always figured, if there are going to be tough times ahead, why experience this in a job I hate? I would rather experience tough times doing something I love, at least then my life has meaning!</p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"">As someone that focused on the info-tainment in the corporate market, many senior executives spoke to me about my life and experiences and suggested I become a motivational speaker. This never appealed to me at all as many 'speakers' I had seen were full of hype. Basically he/she stirred up an audience and the high never lasted more than a few days - so I never had much time for the industry.</p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"">Eventually a friend twisted my arm and suggested I speak from my own experience, as he believed my story was an inspiration to him. I was searching for something 'more' hence I started speaking about 14 years ago... but my way. For me it was all about being sincere, authentic and actually walking my talk. It was tough! Ra ra was the flavour of the day, and no one wanted to hear my story. Then everything changed with the first recession – suddenly companies wanted sustainable life skills and a measurable return on investment. They were now looking for 'real-life' practical skills that the majority of staff could implement immediately. They began looking for authenticity and people that actually offered value!</p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"">For the last few years I have been working mainly throughout Africa as I felt this was where inspiration and hope was needed most. I also reached a point where I wanted to touch more lives, not just employees of big companies. In 2006 one of the solutions I came up with, was to offer a FREE 'Useletter' (because you use it) to all delegates that saw me speak. I asked them to pass this information on to friends so that the 'general public' could also benefit from my inspirational messages. In 2009 I launched a You Tube channel called '<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/inspiringtheworld"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">inspiringtheworld</a>' where I began sharing short Quick Tip videos every month. As the popularity of my Useletter and the channel grew, I began uploading videos on a weekly basis.</p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"">Couple this with hundreds of public appearances, I quickly built up a name and in 2010 was elected chairman of the Professional Speakers Association for Southern Africa. During these 2 years I continued on my global travels again, and met some incredible speakers around the world. People that touched my heart and who I so wished the rest of the world could see. And that's when the seed was planted for <a href=""http://www.positivpeople.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">positivpeople.com</a>.</p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"">Although the corporate market is the bread and butter market in the speaking indusrty, my priorities and focus has shifted to wanting to do more! To making the world a better place for all. I am tired of corporate politics, egos, hidden agenda's, political corruption and greed. Although I am living my passion, my frustration is that the majority of people benefitting from my messages are still only the employees of companies who can afford to book a good inspirational speaker! This doesn't sit well with me anymore. What about the rest of the world that need hope and inspiration 'out there'? The people who are the foundation of society! But sadly they are the ones with limited exposure to authentic inspiration - and when they do find something, they are 'milked' for every cent. Hence my desire to inspire for <strong>completely free</strong> via the Internet.</p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"">The reality of life is that we all need to pay a mortgage, taxes, school fees and eat! Yes I am following my calling by speaking and am loving what I do. But in my heart I feel I can do so much more! So far I have done all my free stuff at my own cost and it has been incredibly rewarding. In fact I would love to do this on a daily basis and not just make the site about my message, but include all the incredible people I have met around the world to become part of this venture too. And I am sure you know many amazing people too!</p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"">I believe in walking the talk and practicing what I preach. Don't believe what I say – check me out for yourself. See my client endorsements over the last 10 years <a href=""http://www.wolfgangriebe.com/Reviews%202013/Reviews%202013.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. Look at the over 100 inspirational videos I have uploaded on the You Tube inspiringtheworld channel <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/inspiringtheworld"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>

<p align=""JUSTIFY"">I want to put my money where my mouth is and I want to make this world a better place for all.</p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY""><strong>Why do we need the </strong><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong>£</strong></span></span></span><strong>150 000?</strong></p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"">This is actually the bare minimum to get everything off the ground, but a great start to get us going and enable us to begin changing lives daily. As we establish ourselves, we can offer a larger variety of speakers and message mediums.</p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"">Initially I would focus on uploading a <strong>new video everyday</strong>, including extra inspirational items such as quotations and anecdotes as we receive them. The goal will be to eventually travel around the globe and interview awesome people in every country and built a site that contains video interviews and messages from the world's most inspirational people – <strong>free to access for anyone</strong>!</p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"">This will be your channel and everything will be done to inspire YOU! Hence we will source people from all over the world who are prepared to contribute. From free E-books to Video courses. Anything and everything to help you be more positive and find meaning in life. However, we will also be most conscious of high moral standards and focus on 'authentic' speakers and messages. This means that I won't just focus on industry speakers and gurus, but the normal person out there that does incredible things in their community too!</p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"">Currently I am looking at setting up either outside London or near Frankfurt in Germany. Simply because these are central hubs and offer economic easy access across Europe and the rest of the world. I figure it's the best central location to travel anywhere in the world. Initially I will focus on local people and factor in extra time in my current travel schedule so as to save costs and focus on building up the site as well as brand awareness.</p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"">Currently I am hiring the equipment and studio to do the few shoots I have done. By purchasing our own camera's, lights and tripods we will save costs these costs. It will also give us control over when to shoot and enable more versatility in terms of time and place. We also need a decent edit suite and an editor to finish off the videos. For local interviews we need to rent studio/office space. It is important for me that the videos are professional, clear and well edited. The idea is to try get some of the information aired on public television as well - hence we need good broadcast quality footage.</p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"">We also want to purchase a standard portable banner style backdrop. This will be a curved expanda frame backdrop for travelling. I would like to take a cameraman to various countries with me where we can interview other awesome people and share their messages with the world. This all costs money!</p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"">We need to secure the services of an IT marketer who can run the whole Internet side and create awareness. Currently I put together the website with my limited knowledge. We need a full time high tech IT person to do the SEO, uploading, updating and keep the website looking funky and appealing.</p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"">We need assistance with research on topics and making the message simple and clear for all to understand. This person also need to liase with potential guests and run the office.</p>
<p>That's just the beginning - if it grows as I expect it will - we will need more staff. Yes, we will be using volunteers and there will be many people donating their skill and time, but the permananet staff also need to eat and pay bills. Remember, charity starts at home. The reality is that to offer a free product 'out there' we need to cover costs on the inside. I figure that if we are touching hundreds of thousands of lives, and those who can afford it, just donate 10 Pounds a year (that's a beer and a burger) for an entire year's worth of positive life changing info - we can do it easily!</p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"">As the funds come in, one future goal will be to host public events throughout the world, also for free, where we record and also share these messages on the site.</p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"">Is this idea sustainable and viable?</p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"">Just look at the negativity, hatred and fighting going on daily! The mainstream media only cares about sensationalism and bad news to sell their newspapers, magazines and airtime. It's time someone said, enough is enough and focuses on the positive. I have a challenged the media for years to focus on positive news rather then negative news. They would rather report that 12 people were killed in an accident than use a headline saying that the ambulance arrived in under 5 minutes and saved 4 lives. The believe sensationalism sells.</p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"">I believe that not all of us are that stupid to believe this lie. I believe there are millions of people out there that are tired of the conditioning, and constant negativity that gets rammed down our throats daily. It takes one person to stand up and say, ""Enough is enough."" I'm doing that now! But I can only do it with YOUR help!</p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"">Let's change lives and make everyone everywhere more positive. Let's give this world hope again. Let's give YOU some heroes to look up to again and some mentors that can guide you to achieve your dreams.</p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"">Yes my site is small at the moment – I am already touching around 25 000 lives per month – imagine we could take that to 20 million, and on a daily basis. It all starts with taking the first step. My passion, my dedication is there, with your help we can make this happen.</p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY""><strong>My PROMISE to you – this site will ALWAYS be FREE and ALWAYS about sharing a POSITIVE MESSAGE to the people of this world.</strong></p></div>","A FREE global website for anybody and everybody on this globe to be inspired on a daily basis!

And that's when the seed was planted for positivpeople.com.
Although the corporate market is the bread and butter market in the speaking indusrty, my priorities and focus has shifted to wanting to do more! To making the world a better place for all. I am tired of corporate politics, egos, hidden agenda's, political corruption and greed. Although I am living my passion, my frustration is that the majority of people benefitting from my messages are still only the employees of companies who can afford to book a good inspirational speaker! This doesn't sit well with me anymore. What about the rest of the world that need hope and inspiration 'out there'? The people who are the foundation of society! But sadly they are the ones with limited exposure to authentic inspiration - and when they do find something, they are 'milked' for every cent. Hence my desire to inspire for completely free via the Internet.
The reality of life is that we all need to pay a mortgage, taxes, school fees and eat! Yes I am following my calling by speaking and am loving what I do. But in my heart I feel I can do so much more! So far I have done all my free stuff at my own cost and it has been incredibly rewarding. In fact I would love to do this on a daily basis and not just make the site about my message, but include all the incredible people I have met around the world to become part of this venture too. And I am sure you know many amazing people too!
I believe in walking the talk and practicing what I preach. Don't believe what I say – check me out for yourself. See my client endorsements over the last 10 years here. Look at the over 100 inspirational videos I have uploaded on the You Tube inspiringtheworld channel here.
Whetehr you contribute to my campaign or not, I care, so feel free to subscribe free of charge to my monthly 'Useletter' here. If the link doesn't work - visit www.wolfgangriebe.com and sign up there.
I want to put my money where my mouth is and I want to make this world a better place for all.
Why do we need the £150 000?
This is actually the bare minimum to get everything off the ground, but a great start to get us going and enable us to begin changing lives daily. As we establish ourselves, we can offer a larger variety of speakers and message mediums.
Initially I would focus on uploading a new video everyday, including extra inspirational items such as quotations and anecdotes as we receive them. The goal will be to eventually travel around the globe and interview awesome people in every country and built a site that contains video interviews and messages from the world's most inspirational people – free to access for anyone!
This will be your channel and everything will be done to inspire YOU! Hence we will source people from all over the world who are prepared to contribute. From free E-books to Video courses. Anything and everything to help you be more positive and find meaning in life. However, we will also be most conscious of high moral standards and focus on 'authentic' speakers and messages. This means that I won't just focus on industry speakers and gurus, but the normal person out there that does incredible things in their community too!
Currently I am looking at setting up either outside London or near Frankfurt in Germany. Simply because these are central hubs and offer economic easy access across Europe and the rest of the world. I figure it's the best central location to travel anywhere in the world. Initially I will focus on local people and factor in extra time in my current travel schedule so as to save costs and focus on building up the site as well as brand awareness.
Currently I am hiring the equipment and studio to do the few shoots I have done. By purchasing our own camera's, lights and tripods we will save costs these costs. It will also give us control over when to shoot and enable more versatility in terms of time and place. We also need a decent edit suite and an editor to finish off the videos. For local interviews we need to rent studio/office space. It is important for me that the videos are professional, clear and well edited. The idea is to try get some of the information aired on public television as well - hence we need good broadcast quality footage.
We also want to purchase a standard portable banner style backdrop. This will be a curved expanda frame backdrop for travelling. I would like to take a cameraman to various countries with me where we can interview other awesome people and share their messages with the world. This all costs money!
We need to secure the services of an IT marketer who can run the whole Internet side and create awareness. Currently I put together the website with my limited knowledge. We need a full time high tech IT person to do the SEO, uploading, updating and keep the website looking funky and appealing.
We need assistance with research on topics and making the message simple and clear for all to understand. This person also need to liase with potential guests and run the office.
That's just the beginning - if it grows as I expect it will - we will need more staff. Yes, we will be using volunteers and there will be many people donating their skill and time, but the permananet staff also need to eat and pay bills. Remember, charity starts at home. The reality is that to offer a free product 'out there' we need to cover costs on the inside. I figure that if we are touching hundreds of thousands of lives, and those who can afford it, just donate 10 Pounds a year (that's a beer and a burger) for an entire year's worth of positive life changing info - we can do it easily!
As the funds come in, one future goal will be to host public events throughout the world, also for free, where we record and also share these messages on the site.
Is this idea sustainable and viable?
Just look at the negativity, hatred and fighting going on daily! The mainstream media only cares about sensationalism and bad news to sell their newspapers, magazines and airtime. It's time someone said, enough is enough and focuses on the positive. I have a challenged the media for years to focus on positive news rather then negative news. They would rather report that 12 people were killed in an accident than use a headline saying that the ambulance arrived in under 5 minutes and saved 4 lives. The believe sensationalism sells.
I believe that not all of us are that stupid to believe this lie. I believe there are millions of people out there that are tired of the conditioning, and constant negativity that gets rammed down our throats daily. It takes one person to stand up and say, ""Enough is enough."" I'm doing that now! But I can only do it with YOUR help!
Let's change lives and make everyone everywhere more positive. Let's give this world hope again. Let's give YOU some heroes to look up to again and some mentors that can guide you to achieve your dreams.
Yes my site is small at the moment – I am already touching around 25 000 lives per month – imagine we could take that to 20 million, and on a daily basis. It all starts with taking the first step. My passion, my dedication is there, with your help we can make this happen.
My PROMISE to you – this site will ALWAYS be FREE and ALWAYS about sharing a POSITIVE MESSAGE to the people of this world.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>  Hey Indiegogo, and welcome to our project. We are <strong>Envy Gaming</strong>, where we make serious custom computers for the true hardcore nerds among us! I know what some of you might be thinking that you can go on a lot of websites now a days and have them build a custom machine for you. But here at Envy Gaming we want to take this concept to the next level! No more picking through pre-sorted parts, and especially no more pre-made cases!!!</p>
<p>     When we say custom built for each individual user we mean it. Take for example this amazing computer built into a desk:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.l3p.nl/l3p-d3sk/other-desk-builds/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.l3p.nl/l3p-d3sk/other-desk-builds/</a></p>
<p>(Note these are not our projects in any way, just a concept of what we will be working towards.) </p>
<p>     These great modders are actually where our company idea originally came from. Why not set up a website where we can work with the users to have custom built rigs like the ones above built just for them. EVERYTHING fully custom and unique in every way! That is our main goal at Envy!! No more of hundreds even thousands of user having the same old boring cases and rigs, just the user and what they want and what works for them.</p>
<p>     In essence this is the project we are trying to fund, and I know some of you may have questions about why this project isn't set to launch for a long while. Well to answer that is two fold. One a longer time gives us more time for the word to get out, and more backers to come in. And two for a more personal reason I am currently active duty military but next year I will be heading back home to finish up college and do whatever life throws my way. So by then I can have the full team assembled, all the parts and machinery that we need bought and ready to go. And we can start working on users new rigs as soon as possible. Active duty does not allow enough free time for a project like this, but if our idea takes off and you guys want more and bigger and better rigs, we can make a full time business out of this and spend more time on keeping our customers happy. </p>
<p>     So why $50,000? The main answer to that is because this is going to be a fresh starting company, so we will need to not only buy materials to build these awesome new rigs, but we will need to buy all of the machining tools that are required to take on a job such as this, and if all goes well maybe even our own separate area to set aside just for the business! Also we will need to buy all the proper license and other permits so we can really make this a full on business for you guys. We will also even be building a fully functional website which will be a sort of starting area for users to start the process of making their own rigs, before they have a design meeting via the web with one of our workers. And obviously we can go over funding and that would be great. The more people contribute, the better we can make our business. Better tools, better builds you name it.</p>
<p>     Unfortunately I am terrible at both video recording, and image editing software such as photoshop so I don’t have much in the way of those to show you guys yet. But if this idea starts to take off and gets backers I will work my hardest to work with whomever I can find to get you guys more details, images, and videos and the project progresses, I will be going back home this July for some vacation and plan to then form our team, and work on some images and videos for you guys as well. Thanks you guys we hope to be building you a new custom rig soon!</p>
<p>     Also one final note I would like to add. Even if we reach our goal, backers who donate after the goal is reach will still receive the proper rewards for their donations. The more backing we have the bigger, better, and longer we can keep this going and alive for all you guys!! </p>

<div id=""risks"">
<h3 class=""dotty""><span>Risks and challenges</span></h3>
<p>- The main challenges we will face as a company is making sure we have all the right equipment to fill the needs of our users. We will be making high end steel or other metal type cases so they will be built to last, but also will require good equipment as well.</p>
<p>- If the company does take of we run the risk of be backlogged with orders, which I don't think is a bad thing, but we will make sure that each customer has a set time frame of what to expect, and will be updated as often as possible to the statues of the various projects.</p>
<p>- As far as risk kickstarter does a good job of limiting those as much as possible, so I dont think we have much to worry about there.</p>

KeeBuddy is the most portable cable ever that works to charge and sync both your iPhone and Android on the move. 
One of the major complaints we have on smartphone is that the battery doesn't last as long due to capacity and volume limitations, It could be a lot disappointing while you're playing Angry Birds, playing high-definition tracks, or watching YouTube and your battery gets drained before you know it.
KeeBuddy is the solution that makes perfect sense.








True Mobility

A brilliant replacement to stock long USB cables, it fits neatly onto your wallet,key chain or handbag to juice up your smartphone in a pinch from any USB power source: power banks,Mac Pro, Laptop PC,projectors, cars, speakers,TVs and more than 16 billions USB-ported devices from all over the world!









The size of a small key tag, it's right there when you need it, and out of your way when you don't.
Beyond that,you can use it not just as a short mini charger when you stand by the counter or laptop PC, but much like a regular Apple lightning cable or micro USB cable so you can still use your device while it's charging, i.e. through a wall outlet or car charger.






Say goodbye to the bunched-up cables in your briefcase, drawers or battery pouch.




Support For iPhone AND Android


With a host of mobile devices in place,you would probably shell out for a lightning cable to work with your iPhone 5s, aside from buying a USB cable when you switch to an Android,or vice versa. 
So why buy more for less?KeeBuddy is a smart recharger that can do it all, with a combination of lightning and micro USB connector compatible with iPhone 5s/5/5c, Samsung Galaxy S5/S4, HTC One Max,LG G Flex,Blackberry,and Windows phones.Further, it allows charging for your iPad Air, iPad mini or Android tablets with support of 3.1 Amp charging current.The Freedom Of ChargingWith a clever retractable cable design,KeeBuddy makes it much easier to transport neatly and to charge without messy cords getting tangled up,When your iPhone needs a charge, all you have to do is take KeeBuddy off your key chain,unwind the cord,and plug the connector into USB port on Laptop PC, MacBook Pro, and charger blocks alike. When you're done, simply touch the button on the housing and it winds up easily so that there are no tangled cords to deal with.If you're not next to the desk,you can still use KeeBuddy to deliver power, for example, while watching TV in living room or driving on the road. The cord actually extends out from the cavity, which could make it easy to place the plug into your device's port from a desired length.Perfect companion to your iPhone whether you're in office,at home or on the move!Our Retractable Cable Doesn't SuckWhile retractable cables on the market typically offer the convenience for charging, most of them are flimsy due to the thin cords, and a lot bulky when made to 3 feet or longer. KeeBuddy is of much heavier duty construction with a flat thicker cord that withstands more potential strain placed, and offers an optimal reach of 50cm when fully extended without increasing the bulk.As opposed to regular retractable cables which unwind and rewind in reverse, KeeBuddy employs a clever unidirectional opening design to allow for a compact form factor,and help prevent tangles of the cords inside the reel when extended in haste, which is encountered quite often otherwise.This could be way frustrating when you're on a spree with your iPhone and the battery is dying, let's say,Sunday Night Football games or FIFA World Cup final. What's worse, you run a high risk breaking the cable even your iPhone,as the frustration grows when you've been fumbling for hours to de-clutter the tangle.Reversible USB ConnectorComparable to Apple's lighting connector,yet with more utility,KeeBuddy comes with a patent double side USB (reversible USB) connector on the USB end that allows you to use it in each direction:Connect KeeBuddy to your iPhone or Android and plug the USB end with the front side facing up into Mac or PC, and your smartphone starts charging and syncing through the USB 2.0 interface.Plug in the USB end upside down, and it functions as a flash memory disk so that you can always have a thumb drive on you and never again fumble looking for the drive in your bag,pockets or leaving it behind somewhere.Never Run Out Of MemoryFlash drives are commonly used in everyday life. There are many folks who seem to always forget their drives on the desk,leave them plugged in, or even drop them in the washing machine. With a waterproof thumb drive embedded, KeeBuddy can be used as a USB key to store,upload or download video clips, selfie photos, high-resolution tracks and files to your device anytime,anywhere. The transfer speed is faster than any Cloud storage and you don't need to pay for recurring online Cloud storage subscription.A true lifesaver during outages of Internet (and thus the Cloud), or if you simply want to retain something that's 100% under your control (beware, your data stored on cloud servers could be accessed or hacked by the likes of malwares or phishing emails). With KeeBuddy,you're the only person that has access to your data.The Most Comprehensive Protection EverCompact, light weight, and pleasant looking, KeeBuddy fits perfectly onto your key chain without being too bulky and obtrusive.It features invisible cable design so that you can hardly notice it's a charge cable until the cord extends out. When not in use, both the connectors,cords and thumb drive are well protected from dirt and splash inside the solid housing that's made from quality Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene copolymers. In most cases, less exposure helps prevent accidental breakage. With a rubberized finish, it offers a secure and comfortable grip on your hand. Embedded into the ABS housing are two brushed metal cases that deliver a solid feel and resit against slippage and scratches from your house keys and finger nails.How Does KeeBuddy Compare

The funding we raise with your help, will be used for the main points like High precision injection molding,Die casting,CE & FCC certification,Mass production, Packaging,QA and so much more.FAQWhat if I change phones?The majority of mobile phones on the market for now and in the future are with Micro USB or Apple's 8pin port, so KeeBuddy works with virtually any phones you may upgrade to in the future. However, note that, it doesn't work with legacy iPhones with 30pin port,or those earlier phones with Mini USB even DC2.0 ports.Does it work with iOS 8.0?Absolutely! KeeBuddy is designed to be a key buddy for your everyday life, and we're employing apple-certified lightning connector to make sure it works with iOS 6.0,iOS7.0,iOS 8.0 and later on any lightning-ported iPhones,iPads and iPods.Will it charge my iPad mini?Yup, KeeBuddy charges both your smartphone,and iPad or tablets that requre higher charging current like 2.1 Amp,3.1 Amp. What if I forget to add shipping?For those who make the contribution without shipping,we've created a new perk. Please contribute the shipping amount and select no perk and we will match your contribution up.I don't have an iPhone. Will it work on my phone?No worries,KeeBuddy works with both iPhone and any smartphone with Micro USB port, Samsung, HTC,Blackberry, LG,Nokia,Sony,Motorola, to name a few. If you don't have an iPhone and have no plan to have it in future, you can also contribute to the Android (Micro USB) only version.Can I transfer data as well?Definitely KeeBuddy doesn't just work to deliver power, but also enables data transfer.If you like KeeBuddy, please back us and tell your family and friends so we can make it a reality altogether.Here are some tips to help spread out the word.1.

<p>Since our goal is to bring new users online, we understand that there
will be a lot of people using our tablets that will be a little awkward with
browsing the web and not as experienced with using tablet devices. That is why
the Rooah! Peacock operating system is designed to guide the user through their
online experience. The Rooah! OS learns the user as they are using the device
and will suggest apps, people, websites, and content that it believes the user
may like or find useful. But for the users that are experienced with using the
internet, our software will be more subtle and will not impede the ambitious

          Charger X is the only 100W Fast Charger-Battery-Hub you need.Replacing your USB hub, Laptop charger, 10,000 mAh power bank and travel adapter.No more messy dongles and cables!!      Charger X has integrated the Power Delivery (PD) tech to further increase charging speed. With up to 100W output power, it can easily fast-charge demanding devices, including MacBook Pros, laptops and all iPads.   The latest GaN Technology uses Gallium Nitride (GaN), a new semiconductor material that enables Charger X to be smaller and more efficient. It has improved safety, capacity, performance and retains power better than any existing battery.     Charger X is equipped with a 100W PD USB-C 3.0 Power Delivery port and two 18W/ 15W USB-A 3.0/2.0 Qualcomm Quick Charge ports. You can easily fast-charge multiple devices at the same time.  Power Delivery (PD) fast charging is the recent technology that delivers much higher levels of power than standard charging. It is a specification for handling higher power and allows the most demanding devices to charge quickly over a USB connection.     With 3 USB Ports & 1 Micro SD/ TF Card slot, Charger X can transfer files rapidly. You can easily access your files by plugging in USB HDD, flash drive and Micro SD/TF card direct into Charger X.   Easy to back up your files when traveling. Give you extra spaces for your phones/ iPads/ cameras etc.     Charger X comes with a 10,000mAh battery, easily fully charges any mobile phone several times. It can also charge laptops, iPads, cameras and other digital gadgets. You can replace other chargers and power banks with it.     Charger X is compatible with most common devices, from the most demanding to the smallest ones. It will always be your support and back up all your power. The PD technology auto-detects different devices and charges as quickly as they allow. You don't have to worry about damaging your device by over-currency. ​   Charger X can be used directly in over 150 countries with included plugs. Its interchangeable wall charging heads allow you to use it in most countries around the world! You will find it more convenient and secure than using travel-adapter with other chargers.      We have all seen power banks blowing up for various reasons. Setting fire to homes, causing a severe burn to the owner… As convenience as they are, the battery inside a power bank can be volatile and dangerous if it is not properly designed. However, this will not happen with Charger X, as it is protected by 8 layers of fail-safe designs. Charger X has built-in safety designs to cut off power when it gets overcharged, getting too hot or if short-circuiting takes place. At worst, you may have to send in your Charger X for warranty repair but it will never risk your connected devices.   We want to give you extra safety when using our product. We will perform different industrial tests. Certification marks are also applied to ensure we match the international standard.   ​   After performing various trials and testings, we finally produced our prototype of Power X.  Here, we share our success in completing one of our major milestones.     100W Power Output Demonstration   100W Laptop Charging Demonstration   File Transfer Demonstration

<p><strong>The Beginning</strong></p>
<p>I have been working in a family business for over 15 years. My father Les Pelletz, started a very successful Plumbing and Heating manufacturers Rep agency called Raven Products over 30 years ago. He has designed and patented 7 different plumbing and heating products that have allowed our wonderful company to grow and thrive throughout the years. One of my many duties at Raven has been to travel all over the world visiting factories and attending trade shows and calling on customers. Some of these places were China,Thailand,Canada and many states across the US.The one common factor I become aware of was almost everyone had cell phones, MP3 players, and Tablets.While I was staying at hotels, I started to notice that adults and children alike began to change their habits while enjoying the pools, beaches and Patios. It didn't matter if a family was on a vacation or business executives were attending a convention,as soon as their batteries began to die in their cell phones or tablets the Pools and Patios began to empty as they had to go back to their rooms to charge their devices. I have to admit, I was and still am one of those people.</p>
<p>My father always taught me to be aware of my surroundings and if you can come up with a solution that could make peoples lives easier, then you will have a very successful idea or product. One day, I was sitting by the pool working on my laptop at a hotel in Florida and the glare from the sun was so bright I had to move under a Patio Umbrella. That did the trick. I could see the screen perfectly and began to work on a proposal. About 10 minutes later the phone rang and it was my daughter. As soon as she started to talk and tell me about how she lost her first tooth and how much she missed me and when was I going to come home, I heard the dreaded beeps that alert you when your battery is low and your phone is about to die. I had to stop my chatty 4 year old daughter midsentence and tell her that daddy had to go and I would call her back in 15 minutes. I then turned off my laptop, left the beautiful 80 degree weather and ran to my room so I could plug my phone in the wall so I could continue my conversation. As I was returning to my room, I began to think, what if that phone conversation was an emergency and not my beautiful daughter letting me know her tooth fell out. That bothered me. After listening to the cutest story, as only a 4 year old can tell you,I hung up the phone and realized my phones battery was 3%. I looked outside and knew my time at the pool was over as I had to wait for awhile in my room until the battery was strong enough to keep me connected to my family and work. There had to be a better way!!!!</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/366/425/5d15357f3fa1bb42127987a6f74e0536_large.jpg?1359732583"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><strong>Good Things Come To Those Who Wait</strong></p>
<p>Looking out my Hotel room window, staring down at the beautiful pool and Ocean an idea popped into my head. I would design a product that allows anyone to continue enjoying the outdoors while still being able to use and charge their electronic devices without having to run and hide inside to find a plug.</p>
<p>The idea for The Sumbrella was then born. I would invent a Solar powered patio and beach umbrella that would allow the consumer to continue to use and charge any electronic device while sitting by the pool or the Ocean or enjoying lunch on a Patio.After talking with my family and many different solar manufactures, I realized my dream was too advanced for the current technology. The idea was great, but the solar technology was not where it had to be to design special solar panels that can withstand the opening and closing of an Umbrella and being thrown in the back of a car while driving to the beach. I was forced to put my dream of helping others stay connected while away from the indoors to the back of my mind until April of 2010.</p>
<p><strong>Turning A Dream Into Reality</strong></p>
<p>I was attending a Plumbing trade show in Canada when I met a gentleman from China, who approached me and asked if he could manufacture some products for Raven. We began a conversation, which to this dayhasn't stopped. That gentleman has become a great friend and business partner. Not only has he manufactured many items for Raven, but he has helped bring my dream of The Sumbrella to reality. In April of 2012, after 2 years of designing and tweaking, I finally received my finished sample of the world's first Solar powered charging Patio Umbrella.</p>
<p>As soon as I took out the finished Sumbrella, and unwound the very heavy duty crank that opened the UV protected, wind resistant extremely high quality fabric to it's full 9' width, I knew that I was holding something very special. I had no idea the path The Sumbrella would lead me on in less than one year.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/366/438/c9aac29231cadae827f259239ff311a9_large.jpg?1359732997"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><strong>Finding Customer # 1</strong></p>
<p>Standing in front of me was the most beautiful and functional Patio Umbrella I had ever witnessed. I am not saying that because I invented it, but because it is the truth. The Sumbrella will take your breath away, from the 4 solar panels that blend in the fabric so beautifully you don't even realize they are there, to the 2 USB ports on the extremely high quality aluminum pole that invites the most skeptical of critics to gaze in amazement with the possibilities of never having to search for a plug indoors again.</p>
<p>I sat in front of the computer with the internet turned on ready to share The Sumbrella with the world. Who should be the first company to help bring my dream to the marketplace? That was easy. Brookstone. I typed in <a href=""http://Brookstone.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brookstone.com</a> and on the bottom of the home page I saw a link that said contact a buyer.I filled out the form and hit the send button. Immediately I get a popup thanking me for my submission and a buyer will be contacting me within 4 to 6 weeks. As soon as I saw that, I said to myself, If I receive an email or phone call sooner then 4 to 6 weeks, The Sumbrella will be a huge success. Well, 2 hours after I sent the info, I received both. On the phone was the assistant buyer for Home and Garden and she asked if I could come to their headquarters in New Hampshire to discuss with the head buyer about The Sumbrella.I asked her when, and she said as soon as possible. The next day, my father and I were on the 1 hour drive from Westboro, Massachusetts to Nashua, New Hampshire.There we were sitting in front of The headquarters of Brookstone. It was too good to be true, and the best part was, it was all true.My father, is an amazing salesman. It is not that he pushes products down people's throats, that's not it at all. My father has the rare ability to show that he cares more about making friends and building strong relationships then just selling a product to a customer. I owe all my salesmanship to my him. As we sat in our car about to embark on an adventure of a lifetime my father said something to me that I will never forget. He told me he was not going to say one word, as he was so proud of how far I had come. That gave me the courage knowing he completely trusted my product and how I was going to present it to Brookstone.When I opened The Sumbrella, The head buyer was speechless for about 20 minutes. You could hear his jaw hit the ground with amazement. His first words were, ""This is it. This is what the world has been waiting for!"" I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I believed in my product, but you never know what reaction you will receive from others so I was prepared for the worst. Needless to say, and to make a long story a little shorter, I received my first order 2 months later and The Sumbrella will be featured on the cover of Brookstone in the March, 2013 issue.During this time, I made a business plan that targeted many different industries. These included Hotels, Restaurants, Amusement Parks, Coffee Shops, Colleges and University's, Homeowners and more. I couldn't think of one industry where The Sumbrella would not be a very useful addition to their product offering or service. My philosophy was going to be that I would not keep any inventory and I would start with only the largest of hotel chains and restaurants who I would supply directly from my factory as The Sumbrella is not a one or two dollar item and as with most startups cash flow islow due to all the startup costs. I decided to hired a couple of reps that had established relationships in these markets and the results have been nothing but positive with many potential Po's coming in the next few months.</p>

<p><strong>A Cadillac Problem To Have</strong></p>
<p>As you are well aware, I am writing this to you on Kickstarter as I need your help. I thank my lucky stars everyday that I have been fortunate enough to have the contacts to invent a product that everyone really believes in. The problem with developing a great new product, is that everyone wants it. That takes capitol, and as the sole owner of Sumbrella,LLC, the amount of money Sumbrella will need to sustain all the incoming orders is very hard to come by. As my friends father told me, It is a Cadillac Problem To Have. I couldn't agree more. Sumbrella, with your help, will be able to not only fulfill all the orders that Brookstone and other companies have placed and will place, but it will allow me to keep thousands of Sumbrellas in my warehouse to help expedite shipping and lower freight costs in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Lighting Up The Night Sky</strong></p>
<p>I have travelled to many countries and have seen some of the most beautiful places, but unfortunately I have also seen the poverty and devastation that is so abundant across the globe. In the last two months Sumbrella has transformed into much more than aPatio Umbrella that can be sold to households and hotels and restaurants. Sumbrella has become a life changing and life saving Solar Powered functional charging station that will help to light the night sky for hundreds of millions of impoverished men, women and children across the globe. There are over 300 million people that wake up and go to bed without power each and every day. The Sumbrella will allow children to read books and continue to do their homework and study even when the sun goes down, which will allowfuture generations to thrive and succeed unlike the generations before due to the lack of education and the ability to study at home. The Sumbrella will allow parents to read stories to their children before bed without having to remember to blow out their lanterns. Oil filled lanterns burn and injure over 6000 people a day due to spills and accidents.</p>
<p>The Sumbrella will help to eliminate these dangerous lanterns by having built in LED lights that charge during the day and stay lit for 8 hours during the night. The Sumbrella also allows the user to plug in a USB powered LED lantern or other type of light source.</p>

<p><strong>Why Me? Why Did I Survive?</strong></p>
<p>That is a question that has been haunting the most loving, caring, compassionate and special woman in my life, my soul mate and wife Kelly. Natural Disasters can strike anyone at anyplace at anytime without any warning at all. With the birth of the internet and media all across the globe we are now able to see and witness these disasters almost on a daily basis. Kelly was 48 hours away from experiencing this first hand. Kelly is a registered nurse and she has the biggest heart and always wants to help others in need. New Years day 2010 Kelly was on a plane to Haiti to work with an incredible organization that brings Dr's and Nurses together in third world countries to help treat the sick and spread medicine and vaccines to those in need. They go into the tiniest of villagesand towns and perform surgeries and give vaccines to the young and old and help deliver babies.These men and women are Saints. Well, 48 hours after Kelly left Haitito come home, one of the largest and most destructive earthquakes flattened Haiti and injured or killed many of the same men, women and children Kelly and The Dr's just helped. Why Me? Why Did I survive? That question has been recently answered as Kelly gave me an idea. This idea will change the way people stay in communication with relief efforts, safety personnel and loved ones before, during and after a natural disasters such as Hurricane Sandy, the earthquakes in Haiti, floods, ice storms and more.</p>
<p>Kelly gave me an idea which I just patented worldwide and will be available in August, 2013. Sumbrella,LLC will be introducing the world's only Solar powered emergency 10' popup shelter and charging station. The pop up tent will have 4 USB chargers. One on each Pole which will allow the user to escape the elements while using or charging their phones which will allow them to contact emergency personnel andloved ones to let them know they are ok, due to the loss of power from these Disasters. They will also be able to charge their devices so they don't have to drain the car battery, or waste gas while trying to charge their devices. As we saw with Hurricane Sandy the gas lines were miles long due to the power loss. Many people ran out of gas trying to charge their devices to keep in contact.</p>
<p>I recently contacted the red cross. The woman who I spoke with was so happy someone finally developed this item. She said they would have put up a tent at every street corner after Hurricane Sandy hit. That would have lessoned the gas lines tremendously and allowed worried loved ones to stay in contact. She is very interested in carrying The Sumbrellaand thinks the tents will provide a much needed service during times of disaster. I just received my final sample and it looks incredible. In the next few months I will be contacting many other relief services such as FEMA.</p>

<p>Sumbrella, LLC, has just started a non-profit organization called Kelly's-World. This life changing organization will bring alternative energy sources to men, women and children in need across the globe. Sumbrella,LLC will provide 1 Sumbrella to Kelly's-World for every 10th Sumbrella sold, which then will be delivered to Poverty stricken areas of the world or areas affected by Natural disasters. Kelly's-World is dedicated to all the men, women and children who have lived without power for much too longor have been affected by Natures wrath.This charity would not have been possible without my wife's haunting question, that can now be put to rest.</p>
<p>Kelly, you survived to help provide the world with an alternative source of energy that will have an impact on saving millions of lives by keeping communication open during times of disaster and power outages.</p>
<p>With your Pledges and Charitable contributions to both Sumbrella,LLC and Kelly's-World, I will now be able to spread the word and build up inventory that will allow Sumbrellas to be distributed across the globe to those in need.</p>

They go into the tiniest of villagesand towns and perform surgeries and give vaccines to the young and old and help deliver babies.These men and women are Saints. Well, 48 hours after Kelly left Haitito come home, one of the largest and most destructive earthquakes flattened Haiti and injured or killed many of the same men, women and children Kelly and The Dr's just helped. Why Me? Why Did I survive? That question has been recently answered as Kelly gave me an idea. This idea will change the way people stay in communication with relief efforts, safety personnel and loved ones before, during and after a natural disasters such as Hurricane Sandy, the earthquakes in Haiti, floods, ice storms and more.
Kelly gave me an idea which I just patented worldwide and will be available in August, 2013. Sumbrella,LLC will be introducing the world's only Solar powered emergency 10' popup shelter and charging station. The pop up tent will have 4 USB chargers. One on each Pole which will allow the user to escape the elements while using or charging their phones which will allow them to contact emergency personnel andloved ones to let them know they are ok, due to the loss of power from these Disasters. They will also be able to charge their devices so they don't have to drain the car battery, or waste gas while trying to charge their devices. As we saw with Hurricane Sandy the gas lines were miles long due to the power loss. Many people ran out of gas trying to charge their devices to keep in contact.
I recently contacted the red cross. The woman who I spoke with was so happy someone finally developed this item. She said they would have put up a tent at every street corner after Hurricane Sandy hit. That would have lessoned the gas lines tremendously and allowed worried loved ones to stay in contact. She is very interested in carrying The Sumbrellaand thinks the tents will provide a much needed service during times of disaster. I just received my final sample and it looks incredible. In the next few months I will be contacting many other relief services such as FEMA.
Kelly's-World





Sumbrella, LLC, has just started a non-profit organization called Kelly's-World. This life changing organization will bring alternative energy sources to men, women and children in need across the globe. Sumbrella,LLC will provide 1 Sumbrella to Kelly's-World for every 10th Sumbrella sold, which then will be delivered to Poverty stricken areas of the world or areas affected by Natural disasters. Kelly's-World is dedicated to all the men, women and children who have lived without power for much too longor have been affected by Natures wrath.This charity would not have been possible without my wife's haunting question, that can now be put to rest.
Kelly, you survived to help provide the world with an alternative source of energy that will have an impact on saving millions of lives by keeping communication open during times of disaster and power outages.
With your Pledges and Charitable contributions to both Sumbrella,LLC and Kelly's-World, I will now be able to spread the word and build up inventory that will allow Sumbrellas to be distributed across the globe to those in need.
Thank you for believing in The Sumbrella, Kelly's-World, myself and my story.

taking the pill correctly. Dosage, timing and frequency all play a

<p>The
US has been hit by staggering statistics from the CDC, SEICUS and The
National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy that 74 out
of 1000 girls between 15-19 in rural areas become pregnant annually.
With that number being 63/1000 in metropolitan areas, it proves that
raising your kids in Middle America, does not exclude them from the
chances of teenage pregnancy. The racial statistics are even more
staggering. The further into Middle America you go, the lower the
population of African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians get. Which
causes a huge swing in the ratio of inner-city African American
teenage pregnancies to Rural Non-African American teenage
pregnancies. The statistics show that these numbers make the issue
just as explosive and harmful in both communities. With the Hispanic,
Asian, Native American and Native African populations unaccounted for
in this research, we see a great opportunity to enter into this
marketplace poised for success.  </p>

<p>We
at Unique Empire are excited to bring you some GREAT Perks that will
give any contributor a great product and the ability to be involved
with a wonderful cause.  
</p>
<p>Also,
we are currently designing various skins that will be able to be used

designs. This will give a very personal age appropriate look to each
device.  
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We
have put a lot of time, funding and effort into our project but like
many things in life, not everything can be completed by just a few.
You and your contribution will enable us to reach our goal. You will
be a part of a worldwide movement and be first in enabling us to
complete production of our unique product. If you believe in our
vision of putting a halt to the worldwide epidemic of teen/unplanned
pregnancy, and looking good while doing it, then please donate to
this project! </p>
<p>We
would like to thank every backer for any contribution and any
assistance in the realization of our project. Share your involvement
in the NEPP product launch among your friends and relatives on
Facebook and Twitter, and together we will bring the NEPP to life! </p>

Empire and the inventor of the NEPP. I am the proud parent of two
wonderful children, both conceived while I was actively taking birth
control. I
know what you are asking…. HOW??? There are hundreds of thousands
of women that asked the same question. It is not about whether the
pill works or not, it is really about whether or not you have been
taking the pill correctly. Dosage, timing and frequency all play a
huge part in your birth control pill regiment being effective. I have
constantly kept on the lookout for ANYTHING that would assist in
keeping me on task with my dosage. I never found one, SO I INVENTED
IT!!!
                                             

What We Do


Unique
Empire will
manufacture and market an automated pill-dispensing unit. The No
Excuse Pregnancy Protector will
help assist consumers in timely administering their contraceptive
pills while not sacrificing style and sophistication. Nearly 67% of
all consumers fail to follow dosage instructions for their
birth control medications. The risk of unintended pregnancy is
greatly increased by not following the dosage instructions.



Unique
Empire's mission
is to provide people the opportunity to live better and healthier
lives though the use of this technology. We will provide a medication
reminder compact, portable, fashion forward
and cost effective package for the consumer which will use patentable
technology to ensure safety, ease of use and continuous protection
from unintended pregnancies and other health complications that may
arise from not following dosage protocols. The target market is women
ages 15 - 44. Sixty-seven million American women
are in this demographic and it is growing annually.








Unique
Empire faces
competition in the medication compliance market from reminder
devices, automated medication dispensers and compliance services. But
those items do not focus on our target market. Teens 15-19 will
comprise a huge share of our customer base.  The company anticipates working with a major distributor to get the product out on the market by the 3rd quarter of 2015.





Unique
Empire is
in the pre-start-up stage, and will be formed as a start-up LLC in
Southeast, USA. The management team has experience in growth-oriented
technology, business unit development, finance, and team leadership
and development. Having witnessed the problems of medication
compliance in their families, the management team is committed to
being part of the solution. Unique Empire is looking to add sales,
marketing and medical device product development experience to its
management team.
The
product is early developmental stage with patent pending. The company
anticipates working with a major distributor to get the product out on the market by the 3rd quarter of 2015.  Projections are 105,000 units during Year 1 and 4,500,000 units
during Year 3 (this will be due to the worldwide patent being
approved).

The
US has been hit by staggering statistics from the CDC, SEICUS and The
National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy that 74 out
of 1000 girls between 15-19 in rural areas become pregnant annually.
With that number being 63/1000 in metropolitan areas, it proves that
raising your kids in Middle America, does not exclude them from the
chances of teenage pregnancy. The racial statistics are even more
staggering. The further into Middle America you go, the lower the
population of African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians get. Which
causes a huge swing in the ratio of inner-city African American
teenage pregnancies to Rural Non-African American teenage
pregnancies. The statistics show that these numbers make the issue
just as explosive and harmful in both communities. With the Hispanic,
Asian, Native American and Native African populations unaccounted for
in this research, we see a great opportunity to enter into this
marketplace poised for success.  





What We Need
Unique
Empire is seeking a total of $10,000.00
in order to complete the development of the N.E.P.P. This $10,000.00
will be used to: 


Finalize
	the prototype of the model


Site
	visits to select a manufacturing and distribution partner.

Apply
	for National and Worldwide patents on the product

Hire
	two sales agents to provide retail orders


Retain
	General Counsel


Focus
	Groups in the US 5 major markets. 
	


The
	first bulk order of the NEPP to contributors




Now,
let us tell you how the funds will NOT be used.
•  The
funds will not be going to personal expenses and bills. 
•  An
office building and expenses associated with having an office.
• 
Expensive and elaborate marketing
tactics.  
• 
Salaries and/or bonuses (We cannot
spend money we haven’t earned)



The Impact

We
at Unique Empire are excited to bring you some GREAT Perks that will
give any contributor a great product and the ability to be involved
with a wonderful cause.  

Also,
we are currently designing various skins that will be able to be used
to cover the NEPP. These skins will be made in various colors and
designs. This will give a very personal age appropriate look to each
device.  



We
have put a lot of time, funding and effort into our project but like
many things in life, not everything can be completed by just a few.
You and your contribution will enable us to reach our goal. You will
be a part of a worldwide movement and be first in enabling us to
complete production of our unique product. If you believe in our
vision of putting a halt to the worldwide epidemic of teen/unplanned
pregnancy, and looking good while doing it, then please donate to
this project! 
We
would like to thank every backer for any contribution and any
assistance in the realization of our project. Share your involvement
in the NEPP product launch among your friends and relatives on
Facebook and Twitter, and together we will bring the NEPP to life!

Who Are We
我々の開発チームは、想像力豊かな、若いメンバーにより構成されています。世界的にも認められる経歴を持つ者が多いことも、チームの特徴です。すでにCASEの特許権を取得しました。Why Indiegogo我々は、写真を撮ることが大好きです。しかし、写真を撮る際、いくらかの不便なことに気が付きました。そこで、何とかして撮影を今まで以上に簡単にできないかと言う考えの下、CASEの開発を始めました。しかし、我々は起業の初期段階であり、一般的な企業のような余裕のある開発資金を確保できていません。そのような中、開発チームの工夫により、合理的に、限られた資金を運用し、プロトタイプを完成させました。この便利なツールを撮影ファンの皆様に、出来る限り安価に提供したいと考えています。しかしながら、現状は資金面における問題を抱えているいるため、次段階の開発および量産を進めることが非常に困難となっています。そこで、Indiegogoはこれまでたくさんの優秀なプロジェクトを支援し、成功させたという実績の下、Indiegogoを通して、皆様からのご支援により、コスト削減と共に、拡張センサーとCASE Proの開発に取り掛かろうと考えています。ご満足いただける製品を世界に提供することで、有望な会社を目指します！あなたの支援が、このプロジェクトを成功させる鍵となります。ぜひ、CASEを使ってみてください！必ず満足していただけると確信しています！あたなの支援は、我々だけではなく、世界中にいる、安価でCASEを購入したい方々に対しても、重要な手助けとなります。資金は全て量産と開発に使用される予定です。出荷に関しましては、およそ３ヶ月後を目処に考えています。Time LineIndiegogo campaign timeline:美しいパッケージでCASEをお届けします！！！Stretch GoalsCASEはスマート撮影のプラットフォームであり、いろいろな拡張機能を利用することができます。CASEの専用Appは、Google PlayとApple Storeにリリースされる予定です。CASE と CASE Pro App の比較:　　CASE now, enjoy future!資金調達の程度に関わらず、CASEの開発は下記の予定通り行います。RewardsUpdated perks!!!　　　　　　　　　一部支援者の要求に応え、刻印サービスを提供します。$10を支払い頂くと、メッセージをCASEに刻むのが可能です。刻み場所：CASEの裏です。文字数：16文字のアルファベットまたは数字に限ります。刻み内容は、メールでお知らせてください。



















Risks and Challenges我々はプロトタイプに様々な検証を施した上で、CASEは間違いなく信頼できる製品であると判断しました。しかし、製品をリリースする上で、リスクとチャンスが同時に存在しています。(a) 販売量によっては、価格が高くなる。検討した結果、販売価格は＄79になります。しかしながら、＄15,000（目標額）の資金を得られなければ、価格設定を見直さなければなりません。当然、資金の調達が不十分であっても、このプロジェクトを継続的に進めていく予定です。我々はCASEが今後、広く認められていくことを期待します。(b) 供給と生産いくらかのご支援により、量産が可能です。できるだけ早い段階で、量産開始ができるよう、我々は準備に取り組んでいます。(c) 出荷出荷時のトラブルをできる限り防ぐために、運送会社はUPS、FedEx、DHLのような信頼のできる会社に委託します。Click to English version of CASE campaignFAQ

3-D films have existed in some form since the 1950s.YouSee3D The Story So Far...

My name is Steven
Fletcher - Director of YouSee3D.

Over the last 8 Months we have
been working on a 3D viewer that would work with iPhone, iPod,
Windows Phone, Android and all Smart phones so you can watch videos from over 100,000 3D stereoscopic Youtube videos now online.We created
designs for a special Fresnel stereoscopic lens that you simply would
hold in front of your phone playing 3D video and - wow - you see
3D...The basic designs where fine tuned to get the best clear
3D possible, the lens even magnifies the video image to immerse you
more into the 3D world.We have now done a basic small
production run and have been busy demoing to retail
companies.Feedback has been very good with pre-orders pending
depending on the final retail packaging that is designed.After spending over $10,000 from our personal funds we
need to raise $7,500 to do a full production run with on lens branding
and to create all the retail packaging and promotion
material.What do you get?We have made available a limited number of lenses from our
initial production run as a perk for anybody helping with funding.
We
are also looking to get sponsorship that would include your business
logo and website address being included on all retail packaging and the website sponsor page.


If you run
a chain of stores we are even giving you the opportunity to have your
own brand packaging done.
I
hope we can get this product into many of the top retail stores, also
there could be interest from Movie companies to co-brand the product
for viewing 3D trailers of their next blockbuster.
In the future we also want to develop a range of iPhone and Android App's that marry up with the YouSee3D viewer and allow easy search of new Trailers and Videos. Another app will enable you to take 3D photos with any iPhone or Android Phone.



Watch 3D video on your iPhone or Smartphone with the YouSee3D viewer.
Watch 3D videos from over 32,000 YouTube 3D videos
MOBILE - Fits in your pocket with your phone.
ZOOM - Enlarges video.
WATCH - Trailers, animations, cartoons, sport, game demos and more...



HOW DOES IT WORK?


The   YouSee3D lens for iPhone, iPod, Windows Phone, Android and all   
Smartphones contains 2 specially designed fresnel lenses that take video
   from a selection of over 100,000 3D  stereoscopic YouTube videos and 
bring the side by side images together to give you real 3D on your PHONE

<p>Hi - We are Tomaso, Gilles, Johnny, Marco and Vittorio from Lugano (Swiss) and Milan (Italy) . We want to tell you about a product we really believe in. It's called <b>hicon</b> - <b>The social Bangle</b>, and it can simplify your life, keeping you  always updated <b>only</b> about smartphone notifications and social network events that are really important <b>for You</b>.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>The idea:</b></p>
<p>In the internet of things and wearable technologies market, wearable devices and smart wristbands lack a true “social media  and smartphone notifications hub” that enable people to:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Communicate our personality and affiliation to particular social spheres;</li>
<li>Encourage visual recognition and physical interaction between other members of the same social networks;</li>
<li>Keep total control over notifications  via discrete, light, text and tactile  alerts  where we cannot have our Smartphone close to us: at school in business meetings, on the beach, while doing sports, while driving, etc. </li>
<li>Customize your smartphone to alert us only when necessary, and read the alerts right from your smart wristband, not even having to take out our phone;</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<p><b>How it works:</b></p>
<p>Simply pledge for a <b>hicon</b> to get your personal tracking URL then press the share buttons or share your unique URL (below the main video at the top of the hicon page).

<p> </p>
<p><b>Risk of challenge:</b></p>
<p>The first challenge we will face is mass production. As a company, our goal is to bring our customers the utmost satisfaction with everything we make. The combined experience of our team members offers an extensive background in product development and mass production. Yet, in reality, there is always uncertainty in large-scale production and scheduling of shipments. In order to mitigate these risks, we are partnering with some of the most experienced manufacturers and suppliers in the industry who are specialized in high-end consumer electronics. Timing is the other challenge we will be facing. Before we can sell our product to the market, we need to obtain certifications such as FCC and CE to meet industry legal requirements. Usually, certification takes about four weeks and we would apply for it two months before our first shipment. We have high hopes that we will pass all certifications . However, if the product fails due to a reason that is not accounted for, we will be looking at a one- to three-months delay. Despite the risks and challenges ahead of us, we promise to continuously update you all on our progress and any other important news.</p>
<p>We've worked pretty hard to get this far...love to hear your thoughts :)</p>

The hicon team

As seen on:
 

 
hicon smart wristband is all your social networks, made wearable!
Hi - We are Tomaso, Gilles, Johnny, Marco and Vittorio from Lugano (Swiss) and Milan (Italy) . We want to tell you about a product we really believe in. It's called hicon - The social Bangle, and it can simplify your life, keeping you  always updated only about smartphone notifications and social network events that are really important for You.
 
 
 

 
The idea:
In the internet of things and wearable technologies market, wearable devices and smart wristbands lack a true “social media  and smartphone notifications hub” that enable people to:
 

Communicate our personality and affiliation to particular social spheres;
Encourage visual recognition and physical interaction between other members of the same social networks;
Keep total control over notifications  via discrete, light, text and tactile  alerts  where we cannot have our Smartphone close to us: at school in business meetings, on the beach, while doing sports, while driving, etc. 
Customize your smartphone to alert us only when necessary, and read the alerts right from your smart wristband, not even having to take out our phone;

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

The Concept:
hicon is a groundbreaking, wearable communicator that helps you effortlessly to share your social media profiles and organize all your smartphone notifications and social updates. Tether this stylish smart wristband wirelessly to any smartphone via its intuitive companion app and go! Now all your social accounts like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Linked In, Pinterest, WeChat Viber, WhatsApp and Google Plus are represented by customized icons that you can  choose to wear right on your wrist. When a selected notification or alert arrives on your smartphone, hicon gently vibrates and lights up in real-time and The OLED  display  will show in a discrete way  the incoming calls, texts, emails and social networks updates. When you wants to turn off a notification, a simple wrist shake will do. hicon also makes meeting new people a breeze. When users with matching  interests come in contact, if you have choosen this configuration from the available settings of the companion app,  the band will blink to help you make a connection. hicon brilliantly brings on-line social networking to the physical space. When it's time to transfer information between devices, do it with a simple handshake ... it's that easy!  hicon even locates your misplaced phone. It's 100% waterproof, sand and shock proof, so you can wear it ANYWHERE.
 
 
 

 
Meet hicon:
hicon wristband is a hi-tech, silicone material shatterproof,  shockproof and waterproof, available in many colors and textures, with interchangeable  social network and smartphone notification icons, it is connected via Bluetooth 4.0 L.E. to your  smartphone through its companion application and it is equipped with an OLED display 128x32 fully integrated into the wristband.  hicon connects to your SmartPhone and updates you on only the notifications you care, from social  networks or from smartphone applications (e.g. mail messages, phone calls, battery life) right at your wrist so that the corresponding icon lights up and vibrates with discretion. 
The OLED display will show you the notifications contents and details, so you can stay updated discreetly and get right back to what you were doing in a second
Thanks to the feature “exchange contacts”, you can exchange your business contacts and references of the social networks with other hicon users through the bracelets with predefined gesture, so you can easily find yourselves in the “virtual” world, share common  interests and passions on the various social network sites that you love the most.
 
 
 


 
 

 

 
How it works:
Plug the icons  you prefer, choose the notifications you want to receive on your hicon and set as you prefer the light configurations. The icons will illuminate and the bracelet vibrates when your smartphone receives  the notification and you will be able to read instantly all the info, contents and details directly on the OLED screen. Might be an incoming call, time, calendar alert, text message, chat messages, email  or events of your social networks. You are  always free to dismiss every notification with a  simple shake of your wrist.
 
 
                    
Always connected through Bluetooth 4.0 L.E. !

Get creative — Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Stumble Upon, BuzzFeed  and blogs are great places to share your  unique URL!

Risk of challenge:
The first challenge we will face is mass production. As a company, our goal is to bring our customers the utmost satisfaction with everything we make. The combined experience of our team members offers an extensive background in product development and mass production. Yet, in reality, there is always uncertainty in large-scale production and scheduling of shipments. In order to mitigate these risks, we are partnering with some of the most experienced manufacturers and suppliers in the industry who are specialized in high-end consumer electronics. Timing is the other challenge we will be facing. Before we can sell our product to the market, we need to obtain certifications such as FCC and CE to meet industry legal requirements. Usually, certification takes about four weeks and we would apply for it two months before our first shipment. We have high hopes that we will pass all certifications . However, if the product fails due to a reason that is not accounted for, we will be looking at a one- to three-months delay. Despite the risks and challenges ahead of us, we promise to continuously update you all on our progress and any other important news.
We've worked pretty hard to get this far...love to hear your thoughts :)

<p>I was born into a family of inventors and I knew since childhood
that inventing was my calling. I was Inspired by problems I  encountered
as a female, a business woman, a homemaker and a mother of three, so I began
finding solutions that save time and make life easier.

How many times have you seen a women try to catch her reflection
on the screen of her phone or even take a picture of herself, just to see how
her hair and face look? The DiamondShield™ solves this everyday problem by
combining a screen protector that protects the phone AND a mirror so you can
see yourself in a moment’s notice?








After months of R&D we now have a final working prototype as shown above. We now need your help to: 1. Get the final manufacturing setup for production for the most popular phones and tablets listed here and 2.Get our retail packaging designed and finalized before being able to sell this to retail chains. 



I was born into a family of inventors and I knew since childhood
that inventing was my calling. I was Inspired by problems I  encountered
as a female, a business woman, a homemaker and a mother of three, so I began
finding solutions that save time and make life easier.







One of my solutions garnered the attention of Kelly Ripa, and
her TLC television venture, Homemade Millionaire. So much so, that my
invention, The Style and Go® Hair Care Valet, beat out thousands of others to
become the winning product on Homemade Millionaire’s premiere episode and
helped me to launch my company Simply Solved Innovations. 












I
read about a company called CrowdHut in Entrepreneur magazine last February and
decided to partner with them to help get my idea for DiamondShield off the
ground. CrowdHut has a team of experts with all the product development
resources I needed, including engineers and product designers. 

I am a member of Edison Nation, an incredible community of inventors, it was there I learned about the product development firm, Enventys, and the producers of the Emmy-award winning PBS television show on innovation, Everyday Edisons. I recruited the team to help me on the branding of DiamondShield as well as my video production and PR for the launch.  
Enventys has experts in industrial design, engineering, prototyping, web and interactive, branding and advertising, public relations and video production all under one roof to help you succeed from every angle. Instead of a singular focus or one size fits all process, they provide solutions tailored to meet your needs.

Over the last four seasons of Everyday Edisons, they have helped create and bring to market over 40 inventor products over the course of 53 episodes with their teams of industrial engineers and designers. 






To thank you for your generous contributions we have created perks at many levels: $10, $15, $20, $29, $500, and $2500. All levels will give you the opportunity to receive a DiamondShield protector before they hit retail stores. At $10, you will receive a personalized email from me, Marcy McKenna, thanking you for your support. At $15, you get to attend a Skype Q/A style conference call with me, Marcy McKenna, where you will have the opportunity to ask me questions about inventing, my experience on the show ""Homemade Millionaire"" or anything else that you would like. At $20 (phones) or $29 (iPads), you get one (1) DiamondShield™ CLEAR OR MIRROR scratch and shatter-resistant screen protector for versions listed below: 
    

Models 4/4s & 5
  
 


Models 3rd & 4th Gen & mini                     


Models S3 & S4




To thank you for your $500 contribution, you will receive 50 DiamondShield phone protectors in retail packaging from the first batch we produce. 
We are also offering the opportunity to be featured in the
DiamondShield commercial for a contribution of $2500.

Introducing the Solar Station ""Lander,"" 


The world's fastest & easiest solar power system




Just point it at the sun and plug into fun
The Lander is for recreational power and outdoor adventures. 
DIY friendly design. It comes complete (batteries included)








What can you do with solar power + extra space?
Here are just a few of the benefits: 



Have a shelter option during an emergency


Download a gear list at http://solarstation.com/emergency


Why did we create Solar Station?



Because a clean environment is our birth right

 



PROBLEM: Without clean energy it's...
Business as usual = drought, pollution & conflict





SOLUTION: Solar Station

What if solar power was fast, simple & scalable? Generated locally? 
With added functionality and an exceptional user experience?




OUR VISION: Recolonize Earth with solar power
Create clean energy, opportunity and foster connection... rapidly






NEXT STEPS: Raise $30,000 to build version 3
It's prime time now! Let's go mass market. Bigger. Bolder. Could we build a citizen supercharger network?


2000 watt solar | 3000 watt inverter | larger batteries | small server




  Turn up the juice! Let's charge homes & cars
Together we can change the world. Your support buys the needed materials





Construction on version 3 has already started!
Thanks to your contributions we have already begun. Stay tuned and watch v3 develop over the campaign.


Adding more panels now. Stay tuned for updates!

My name is Pat Mulrooney, I have three children and live with my wife of 30 years in Lanark, Ontario, a small town west of Ottawa, Canada's capital. I am currently employed as a senior site superintendent for a commercial
builder in Ottawa. As a project superintendent, one of my major
responsibilities is the health and safety of all workers on my site. I am not a writer, this will become apparent as you read on; I have no technical background whatsoever, please appreciate this and be patient if you ask technical questions. I simply have an idea that I believe in, and need your help getting it out there with the hope that it will help others.

The Idea




The idea for the app came to me after having to close my jobsite because I had commitments elseware and could not in clear conscience leave my lead hand alone on the construction
site. Without strict protocols in place it is unlawful to leave a worker alone
in Ontario. The idea was a simple one, an app that would perform two functions; first it prompt the worker at preset intervals by way of an alarm to disable the device; and second if for any reason the worker was unable to disable it a call would be generated to a co-worker, dispatcher, friend or family member that something was wrong.
Not in the construction industry?
This app has more uses than you can imagine!
Does your wife or daughter run? If she does my guess is she runs either early in the morning or late evening. One of the features of this app is a panic button. In a case like this once armed all she has to do is hit the button and the call/text/email is sent as well, as GPS coordinates. Piece of mind for both of you.
What about the security industry. The lone patrol guard now has that extra comfort factor while on a late watch in a remote area.
Babysitters, store clerks, home alone children, hunters, farmers, service technicians, even something as simple as a blind date can have that extra secure feeling knowing someone you know and trust is on the other end of a distress call.

The name may be Work-Safe as it was conceived in the construction industry, but could just as easily be Run-Safe, Sit-Safe, Date-Safe, Hunt-Safe, Secure-Safe.... 





Work Safe provides an alarm system when workers are in a position
where they are expected to work alone. It will give the user working alone the
confidence and piece of mind knowing, that if something happens help will
arrive shortly. 

How Will it Work?



The app has unique features not presently available in the marketplace, many that I cannot reveal as it would compromise the development of the app. Although the programming has not yet been developed and is still in the developmental stages, an explanation of possible operation is as follows: Parameters are preset so that depending on the level of danger, the program will prompt the user to disable the app at preset intervals. At this stage we have chosen three levels of danger represented by colored buttons on the screen, green yellow and red. Once the app activated, and if the user does not deactivate it each time the alarm goes off, the app will generate a call/text message/email to whomever takes emergency calls. That person will attempt to contact the worker, and if unsuccessful will dispatch help immediately. The user may choose to simply arm the device and use the panic button to generate a call/text/email in the event of an emergency. Features such as GPS, audible, visual and vibration will be incorporated into the alarm. Impact sensors that will detect a fall and generate a call are also being incorporated as part of the app. This app may have been conceived for work,  but the uses and possibilities are endless.

Why does your contribution matter?




We have all heard and read stories on the news about tragedies involving  workers being injured or worse while working alone. I can't say that this app will solve all the problems associated with working or playing alone, but what if it helps avoid one critical injury. What if that one runner out for a late night run is kept out of harms way. What if that worker, runner, security guard or baby sitter was your husband, wife, son or daughter? Wouldn't you feel better knowing they are but a push of a button from getting the help they need?

Play-Safe



How will your investment be spent?

At this point I have invested thousands of dollars and spent countless hours on development and progress of the idea. I am at a point where I need help if I am going to see this through to the end. The goal I set at 40,000 (CAD) breaks down as follows:




$25,000.00 is needed for development and programming costs, this will create a ready to use product on both android and apple platforms, covering the largest market.


The $15,000.00 balance is marketing, campaigning safety organizations,  and R&D. We want this to hit the ground running with strong legs.





Ultimately my goal is to have this available to everyone for as little as possible. That said the more I raise for development the less it will ultimately sell it for.


What if we don't reach our goal?

If we fall short we will decide which platform to develop first, market what we can and move forward, I do not see this ending that easily. In my mind this funding is as much about raising capital as it is about consumer feedback. In other words if you see enough potential in the idea to invest in it, it will fly.

Use the app to find local gaymer meetup groups around you, in your local city or a new city you're visiting!<br/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/>A Story: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>I've always loved playing video games and happened to be gay. I would spend most of  my free time playing my favorite video games in the comfort of my living room. Even though I enjoyed gaming, I still wanted friends who I could play with. I attempted using other social apps to find someone to play with, but it was hard to tell who matched my gaming interests. After a lot of searching, I finally connected with a few other gaymers, but still wondered why there isn’t an app to help me connect easier with other gaymers in my local community. So I decided to take on the endeavor to meet that need. </span></p>

</div></div>","We're building a social app for gaymers to connect with nearby gaymers, engage in a game, and find local meetups!

WHAT IS GAYMER APP
Gaymer App is a revolutionary app for gaymers to unite socially through common gaming interests, while promoting a safe and fun experience. From within the app, meet fellow gaymers in your local community or across the country, and invite them to game! Whether it's a challenge, a friendly match, or you need help beating a boss, connecting with a fellow gaymer is only a few taps away! In addition to finding your next gaymer through our exciting app, find and discover events and meetups for gaymers in your area!

Key Features



Find Gaymers to Co-OpConnect with gaymers in our app to engage in a game! One of the primary features of Gaymer App is for you to check in with the game you're currently playing, or enter the games you enjoy playing the most. Gaymer App will find gaymers closest to you based on your current location, who are currently playing the same game as you or with similar gaming interests.

Unlock Gaming Network UsernamesYou have the power to unlock your gaming network usernames to other gaymers individually, or keep them private until you're ready to engage in a game. This makes it easier for you and your new gaymer friend to find and connect with each other on your gaming consoles.


Gaming StatsDo you love stats? With Gaymer App, check in with the game you're currently playing and we'll help keep track of the games you like playing the most and how often you play them. You can keep your gaming stats private or share them with other gaymers. We'll also summarize what type of games you like to play, whether it be FPS, MMO, RTS, etc.


Events for Local MeetupsAround the world, gaymer groups are growing with amazing fever! We want gaymer communities grow stronger and connect in a new way. Gaymer App will allow verified gaymer groups to invite gaymers based on their location, and you'll be able to find meetup events around you!



WHY GAYMER APP
There currently isn't a simple platform to easily find gaymers around us to join in on a game. With Gaymer App, the goal of the app is to be a single platform where you can engage with other gaymers, connect with them, and co-op with them in a game. Gaymer App is all about getting you to play the games you already love with new friends! Use the app to find local gaymer meetup groups around you, in your local city or a new city you're visiting!A Story: 

I've always loved playing video games and happened to be gay. I would spend most of  my free time playing my favorite video games in the comfort of my living room. Even though I enjoyed gaming, I still wanted friends who I could play with. I attempted using other social apps to find someone to play with, but it was hard to tell who matched my gaming interests. After a lot of searching, I finally connected with a few other gaymers, but still wondered why there isn’t an app to help me connect easier with other gaymers in my local community. So I decided to take on the endeavor to meet that need. 
-Eric Hulsey, Founder

Who is a Gaymer?


Gaymer or gay gamer is an umbrella term used to refer to the group of people who identify themselves as gay, bisexual, lesbian, or trans, and have an active interest in the video gaming community. Whether you play on a console, PC, tabletop games, or mobile games, you can still be a gaymer.

THE DETAILS OF GAYMER APP
What are the goals of the Indiegogo Funds?
The funds from the Indiegogo campaign goes towards the creation and implementation of a functional Gaymer Social Mobile App. We're working with an experienced development team to deliver the best app experience.

PHASE I - Under this phase, we will be able to have our developer start work on the UX (User eXperience) and the artwork, which means building the looks and laying out a roadmap of features.
PHASE II - This is the phase where we have our developer get down to the nitty-gritty of development for iOS devices, then Android devices if we are fully funded. This is where the bulk of the time and expenses reside. Once developed, we will migrate everything to servers that we will lease (the ""Other"" expense). At the end of this phase, we'll open up testing for our beta testers who will get access to the app for testing functionality and server load.COSTS BREAKDOWN

</h2>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our goal is to build a powerful, True Linux Tablet, one free of Google and Android's restrictions, at a reasonable price.  If you're a Linux fanatic you probably ended up getting an Android phone. Hey, it's Linux right? It'll be open, run all the programs I'm familiar with and let me hack around and have some fun right?  Too often, this is not so. That is why we set out to find a way to run real Linux and all the software you really want on the incredibly low cost and powerful Arm based System on a Chip(SOC) hardware available for tablets. Enter the Allwinner A10 SOC.  This beast of silicon radically changed the market overnight with 1.2 Ghz speed, glitch free HD video coprocessing, 3D acceleration, HDMI, SATA....</p>
<p><strong>Features of the Allwinner A10 include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">1.2ghz Cortex A8 ARM Core</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">MALI400MP OpenGL ES 2.0 GPU</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">4 SDIO interfaces</p>
</li>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">USB 2.0 Host as well as a 2nd USB-OTG Interface</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">24-pin RGB/TTL as well as simultaneous HDMI out</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">SATA-II 3gb/sec</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">10/100 Ethernet</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>GPIO, I2C, PWM, Keyboard Matrix (8x8) and much more.</p>
<p>This processor and its incredibly low price have enabled a whole generation of low cost, high powered electronics. Beyond just tablets, the A10 is used in mini PCs, “TV Sticks”, netbooks and more. All these devices come standard with Android, which is a good start, but not enough.  Now we come to the best part.  Allwinner's Linux kernel source has been made available and has an active community working to mainline it.  Their contributions have created a stable system running true Linux, not just Android with a working U-boot, kernel and Debian, Ubuntu or Linaro root file system.  This system is open source top to bottom and almost feature equivalent with Android on the same hardware. The purpose of this Kickstarter is to complete development of the PengPod line of Allwinner based electronics and improve the tablet related features in the community Allwinner Linux kernel. As a bonus, all these devices already run a high quality, stable version of Android they can easily be made to run both systems. Why not have the best of both worlds?</p>
<p><strong>The Devices</strong></p>
<p>Introducing the PengPods, a line of high powered Linux tablets and PCs! All these devices are the latest available in their category and show what the Allwinner chips can do. All devices are available in the rewards with Android and some with Linux pre-installed. We are focused on the tablets and our initial goals will fund the completion of the software enhancements and hacking tools for PengPod tablets. We intend to eventually offer all the devices with preinstalled Linux if our stretch goals are met. All devices will have Linux images available for download at shipment time, regardless of whether they are available with Linux pre-installed, which depends on the stretch goals.  We have a new demonstration video coming very soon...</p>
<p><strong>Product line includes:</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><img alt=""PengPod 700 Tablet"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://pengpod.com/images/crowd/PP700-Info-nova.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""PengPod 700 Tablet""/> <img alt=""PengPod 1000 Tablet"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://pengpod.com/images/crowd/PP1000-Info-new-nova.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""PengPod 1000 Tablet""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p>The remaining devices will be available as strech goals.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">PengPod713: 7” Tablet with A13, 512MB ram, 4GB flash for under $100</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">PengBox: Mini PC with 1GB ram, 4GB flash around $110</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PengBook: 10"" Netbook with A10, 1GB ram, 8GB flash around $160</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What will my device come with?</strong></p>
<p>Linux or Android, its your choice. Every PengPod device is capable of running from internal flash or booting from an SD Card. You can choose to get your device with Android or Linux pre-installed.  If you choose Android you will still be able to boot the device into Linux with a properly prepared SD card. In the rewards we are also offering SD cards preprogrammed with bootable Linux images, so if you want both, just add the SD card amount to your contribution and make sure to fill out the survey we send so we know which image you want.</p>
<p>If we reach our stretch goals, we will begin offering more devices, but some might be offered with Android pre-installed only until a further goal is met. The devices will still support Linux and we will have images ready for them by the time they ship, but again we may not be able to pre-install Linux on the internal memory.  Please keep an eye on our project updates for more information.</p>
<p>All devices also include standard accessories like power plugs and cables, check each device for details. We also have several accessories available which make the devices better, make sure to take a look!</p>
<p><strong>Why crowd funding?</strong></p>
<p>Most of the software we will be providing is stable, open source and freely available, so why the crowd funding? Our experience has proven it takes a lot of time to locate, research, build and run all the pieces needed for a working A10 Linux system. We are working to coalesce all these parts into a stable image so users can be up and running right away. Our time is precious and every hour we can avoid redoing something that already works is another we can spend hacking!</p>
<p>The hardware is ready to be made with no further hardware engineering. </p>
<p>While we have a good, running Linux system now for all the devices, there are still some rough edges. We intend to fix up the tablet related features, host a central repository of A10 specific packages and create images and guides to make these devices even better. All these efforts will take time and we plan to use the proceeds from the crowd funding to fund the remainder of the software work and maintenance.  We would like the Linux tablets to match the main Android feature list.</p>
<p>The features which are not yet complete are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">G Sensor based automatic screen rotation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Hardware button support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On board camera support with Video4Linux.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These features are close to ready and will be completed using the proceeds from the crowd funding. Interested in hacking? We are also going to...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Maintain a community forum and wiki</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Provide source for everything we create and share it on Github.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Provide a package repository for the PengPods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Provide prebuilt images, with updates as available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide tools, scripts and guides as we go.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on how much is brought in we are also considering offering prizes for developer teams implementing community goals, adding more devices and maybe even other processor lines to our support list. Many of the tablet related packages created will benefit systems beyond Allwinner and hopefully help create a true Linux based tablet movement.</p>

<p>Perks:  Please note its $5 extra to get Linux installed on the internal flash, make sure you add that to your contribution.  Linux on flash devices might take a few more weeks to ship, we will keep you informed when we get to this stage.  There seems to be a limit on the number of perks, so we had to stack options inside the perk, sorry its a little compilcated.  Make sure to ask us if you have any questions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Accesories:  The accesories in the perks can be added to any PengPod device by contributing the extra amount indicated.  It will be less than getting it individually becuase of the shared shipping.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>BONUS:  We realize Christmas is right around the corner and some people might be consider PengPods as gifts.  Given the busy holiday manufacturing and shipping schedules we will not have the devices before Christmas.  So if you want to give one as a gift, for no extra charge we will send a nice certificate to let the receiver know their gift is on the way soon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>About shipping outside the USA:  Our perks are based off USPS domestic rates.  If you want your device shipped outside the USA you must add an addition amount.  For PengPod devices to Canada and Mexico, $24 for everywhere else $39.  If you are only getting an SD card then the rate is $12 to Canada and Mexico and $16 for everywhere else.  These fees are one per shipment, so if you get several items you only have to pay the additional fee of your largest item once.  This does not include and duties, fees or taxes that may be charged by your governent or domestic carrier which will be solely your responsibilty.</p>

There are many USB-cabels designed as keychains, that work only connecting with laptops or computers. We have decided to create a keychain with its own battery.



zFob


Battery’s
capacity is 220 milliamp hours, and it can provide about 30-40 extra minutes of
talk time or up to several hours being on standby.
Undoubtedly
you were in such situations, when you didn’t have possibility to charge your
cell phone and it switched off at the most critical moment. You could neither
make a call nor send a message. You also couldn’t use a map. With zFob you need
not worry about it.
Size







How it works

Charge
up the zFob from the supplied cable. Then just put it in your pocket or attach
it to your keychain.

How to
use it

Just move
the slider-button up, connect the zFob with your cell phone and it will start to
charge. 



Parts and desing




A
lighting connector is used in device. It means that you can use it only with
iPhone 5; 5s; 5c; iPad 4; iPad mini; iPod touch.

We also
think about an opportunity to use Micro-USB in this device so that will be able
to charge Android phone.

We've been working together with copyright lawyers and developers to create an app that will protect your intellectual property. </p>
<p><b>Your photos are protected by a process that runs in 3 steps:</b></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>By marking the photos you take on your phone as yours. They become registered to you.</li>
<li>By searching the internet for replicas of your photo. </li>
<li>By providing you with proof of your photo's registration, thereby giving you the legal documents necessary to prove your authorship and make a case.</li>
</ol>
<div>We need your support to bring this app to life and to begin creating a culture of responsible photo sharing online. <br/><br/><h3>App description</h3>
<p>Priorr will be a free to use app. Anyone will be able to download the app,
and from that moment on, every photo you take on your phone will automatically
be registered under your ID. The app will function in the background of your
phone, and will automatically be constantly scanning the internet for copies of
your photos. When such copies are found, the app will send you a
notification. </p>
<p><b>Features</b></p>
<ul>
<li>automatic photo tagging</li>
<li>constant internet searching for copies of
     your photos</li>
<li>notifications when replicas are found</li>
<li>watermark and logo tool</li>
<li>manual photo search
</li>
</ul>
<p><b><span>Additional
Priorr services</span></b></p>
<p>Besides the free app, we'll be
able to provide you with documents and ownership certificates that you can use
to build your case in the event that your photos are stolen. The <b>evidence
package </b>and <b>ownership certificate </b>are documetns that
you can request, and will be made available in 8 different languages, to
minimize the communication barrier. </p>
<p><b>The watermark
and logo tool</b></p>
<p>Rather than waiting for your
photos to be stolen, you'll be able to act preventatively. Before you share
your photo online, you can use the free watermark and logo tool to mark up your
photo and make it yours, to dissuade others from sharing it without contacting
you first. </p>

<h3></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We're tired of the disregard for images that's ruled the
internet. The fact that merely by sharing your image, it because subject to

photo. </span></p>
<p><span>To being to break the mold of careless stealing, we

<p><b>For photographers</b></p>
<p>Photos are your bread and butter. The internet is a fantastic medium to share you art and gain recognition, but it's also a stealing machine.

</div></div>","Finally, protect your photos online Until now we've never had the tools to protect our photos online. We've been working together with copyright lawyers and developers to create an app that will protect your intellectual property. 
Your photos are protected by a process that runs in 3 steps:


By marking the photos you take on your phone as yours. They become registered to you.
By searching the internet for replicas of your photo. 
By providing you with proof of your photo's registration, thereby giving you the legal documents necessary to prove your authorship and make a case.

We need your support to bring this app to life and to begin creating a culture of responsible photo sharing online. App description
Priorr will be a free to use app. Anyone will be able to download the app,
and from that moment on, every photo you take on your phone will automatically
be registered under your ID. The app will function in the background of your
phone, and will automatically be constantly scanning the internet for copies of
your photos. When such copies are found, the app will send you a
notification. 
Features

automatic photo tagging
constant internet searching for copies of
     your photos
notifications when replicas are found
watermark and logo tool
manual photo search


Additional
Priorr services
Besides the free app, we'll be
able to provide you with documents and ownership certificates that you can use
to build your case in the event that your photos are stolen. The evidence
package and ownership certificate are documetns that
you can request, and will be made available in 8 different languages, to
minimize the communication barrier. 
The watermark
and logo tool
Rather than waiting for your
photos to be stolen, you'll be able to act preventatively. Before you share
your photo online, you can use the free watermark and logo tool to mark up your
photo and make it yours, to dissuade others from sharing it without contacting
you first. 






   Why bother? Who is this for?

We're tired of the disregard for images that's ruled the
internet. The fact that merely by sharing your image, it because subject to
theft, and there's virtually nothing you can do about it. We want to change
this. To create a tool that you can use to claim your rightful ownership of a
photo. 
To being to break the mold of careless stealing, we
need to start by recognizing ownership. 
For photographers
Photos are your bread and butter. The internet is a fantastic medium to share you art and gain recognition, but it's also a stealing machine. Very often your work will be taken and republished, not only without payment or permission, but worst of all, without even giving credit! Let's make giving credit the norm. 
For the online persona
You're interested in how often your photos are shared, by whom, and where. We'll show you. Not to mention you'll get the watermarking and logo application tool to band your images for free.

<p>Ionizing radiations gather a lot of radiation types (or particles) and their energy can be very different.</p>
<p>Rium can identify these differences and analyse the energy of every interaction betwen the sensor and any ionizing radiation. This technology allows us to create spectra (especially gamma). The form of each spectrum give us the name of the particle.  Combinations between radionuclides allow us to identify the origin of the source.</p>
</div><h3>Only Android ?</h3><p>No, iOs is coming in 2017 !!</p><h3>We can’t find the app on the store.</h3><p>The app will be available a few weeks before the delivery of the first Rium sensor.</p><h3>How will you manage the delivery of Rium ?</h3><p>Every backer will be informed of the delivery dates. And for people who ordered a Rium, we will contact them by mail to check all the information and especially the adress.</p><h3>What is the autonomy of the sensor ?</h3><p>Rium is developed to function several weeks without charging the battery. If you decide to use it as a fixed station in a house, he can be connected all time long.</p><h3>If I want to let Rium collect data all day long, without being near my smartphone, what solution do you propose ?</h3><p>Rium has an internal memory able to stock data : in normal condition Rium can collect data more than a week. Furthermore, Rium is equipped by an accelerometer which insure the GPS situation of the sensor, if the smartphone is moving. The position at the moment of the connexion can be selected as a reference.</p><h3>What is the frequence  of the measurement ? Is this frequency variable, what impact on autonomy?</h3><p>Rium can measure the radiation level every two seconds. This parameter is adjustable in the options. Different modes of measurement are proposed, they vary the autonomy of the battery from 48 hours to several weeks.</p><h3>If my smartphone is out of service, what happens to the data ?

Furthermore, our instrument will be able to differentiate not only the particle type (Gamma, Alpha, Beta) but also radioactive isotopes (radon, uranium, cesium, etc.). This information will trace the origin of exposure (natural, industrial, medical) and accurately calculate its impact on health in real time. Moreover, our app gives you tips to reduce your expose to radiation.We have designed a wooden housing capable of meeting the aesthetic requirements of users while respecting the technical constraints associated with radioactivity detection.  RIUM is connected to a smartphone via Bluetooth and usable through a dedicated mobile app for data processing, analysis, pedagogical displays, geolocation and networking tools.Data collected by instruments can be shared through the Internet. This allows the creation of an instantaneous mapping of radioactivity and its evolution, and it could provide tracking of radioactive materials on the territory. Thus, we provide a response to environmental questions and homeland security needs, these issues being of concern to citizens.Earthquake prediction 
By detecting radon, the RIUM network is able to predict earthquakes !Since several years, researchers have shown reliable correlation between emission of radon gas and earthquakes. We can cite several peer-reviewed papers as:NATURE : Scientific Reports | 5:13084 | DOI: 10.1038/srep13084 | A radon-thoron isotope pair as a reliable earthquake precursor Yong Hwa Oh & Guebuem KimOur technology is able to take advantage of these researches through our data collection services. Then, based on such results, we propose the first network able to predict earthquakes a few days before they occur. This network can be efficient only with numerous detectors and a big data analyze. YOU can support network deployment! Have a look on the perks !Thanks to your support, the network may be deployed early enough to predict the BIG ONE in California !How to use it?You can measure your daily surroundings and identify every sources of radiation : glasses containing uranium, lighting keychains, watches, smoke detectors, radon gas emanations, and lots of others including wastes.Easy to use pocket sensor With RIUM you can measure your exposure into your home, and offer a safer environment to your family thanks to tips given by the mobile app.A collaborative map Furthermore, users can join the community and create a worldwide watching network with highly reliable data which will be free to access and used for the sciences, for homeland security and citizen power.Last but not least, RIUM mobile app is also design for educational uses : you can learn science through our software, or use it to raise your children or students' awareness of radioactivity !RIUM is different from conventional radioactivity sensors such as Geiger counters. Indeed, the Geiger meters only measures a radiation level. However, RIUM is able to give you information on the origins of measured radioactivity. For example : medical, industrial, natural, etc. Thus RIUM is a spectrometer able to compete with laboratory instruments. Thus, RIUM combines high performances, ease of use, and a small size. Through its connectivity, RIUM allows all users to share their datas and create a citizen network. RIUM can also adapt to many professional and scientific uses.Here are 5 major advantages of RIUMSee how RIUM compares to other sensors :Each partner supports us financially or trough public communication

We are a new company based in Limoges and Lyon, in France. We developed RIUM during the last year, and we are now ready to start production.However, we need to buy many tools before starting production. That is why your support is essential for us!We need $ 15 000 to be able to manufacture a first series of RIUM.  With $ 40 000, it would be possible for us to organize a real factory, and if $ 40 000 is exceeded, we will be able to start development of others pollution sensors, as electromagnetic waves.How to support us ?The first simple act you can do for us, is to share the link of the campaign around you.Thank you and let's go for questions !How to identify radioactivity source ?
Ionizing radiations gather a lot of radiation types (or particles) and their energy can be very different.
Rium can identify these differences and analyse the energy of every interaction betwen the sensor and any ionizing radiation. This technology allows us to create spectra (especially gamma). The form of each spectrum give us the name of the particle.  Combinations between radionuclides allow us to identify the origin of the source.
Only Android ?No, iOs is coming in 2017 !!We can’t find the app on the store.The app will be available a few weeks before the delivery of the first Rium sensor.How will you manage the delivery of Rium ?Every backer will be informed of the delivery dates. And for people who ordered a Rium, we will contact them by mail to check all the information and especially the adress.What is the autonomy of the sensor ?Rium is developed to function several weeks without charging the battery. If you decide to use it as a fixed station in a house, he can be connected all time long.If I want to let Rium collect data all day long, without being near my smartphone, what solution do you propose ?Rium has an internal memory able to stock data : in normal condition Rium can collect data more than a week. Furthermore, Rium is equipped by an accelerometer which insure the GPS situation of the sensor, if the smartphone is moving. The position at the moment of the connexion can be selected as a reference.What is the frequence  of the measurement ? Is this frequency variable, what impact on autonomy?Rium can measure the radiation level every two seconds. This parameter is adjustable in the options. Different modes of measurement are proposed, they vary the autonomy of the battery from 48 hours to several weeks.If my smartphone is out of service, what happens to the data ? Are they lost ?Rium has an internal memory to store data : in normal condition it can run autonomously for more than a week. They can be recovered via Bluetooth or microUSB.What is the lifetime of Rium ?Several tests will be done before the delivery but the lifetime isn’t supposed to be limited. The battery can be changed by the user.   Version Française - French Version Le produit est fabriqué en France!

Why Get Duet?1.You'll Never Lose Your Smartphone AgainBe alerted quickly if you've left your smartphone behind!

With duet's beep, you’ll know it right away. And for those of us with a habit of losing phones, you will find that Duet’s alarm trains your brain to develop the good habit of checking if the phone’s on you always. Say goodbye forever to the panic, worry and frustration of losing personal messages, contact lists and selfie photos.Key FeaturesPrompt - Left your phone behind?

<p>The risk is simply that we don’t have enough money to buy all the components until enough funds are raised through the website.

<b>1. How long does the battery last?
</b><p><span>With only one button and a small LED light, the amount of power used is extremely small (in terms of just μA). Therefore, </span>the rechargeable battery keeps Siring going for 20-30 days. Siring should at least provide 10-15 days of battery life with phone call notifications and up to 30 days when all functions are used minus the phone call notification function.</p>
<p><b>2. How far away can my Siring be from my phone?</b></p>
<p>Siring must be within 20ft of your smartphone to stay connected.</p>
<p><b>3. What Apps does Siring support?</b></p>
<p>Siring can remotely control all core apps on your iPhone, and by enhancing it using the SDK, all apps can theoretically be controlled. More specifically, Siring is your mobile mouse that helps you to operate your iPhone. And we have only one button with three kinds of button press methods: short, long and double presses. You can set up different press methods for different usages. For example, short press to one-key unlock your phone, double press to go to the Home screen, and long press to open your music, like iTunes or Spotify.</p>
<p><b>4. What's the material of the ring?</b></p>
<p>We contemplated which materials to use for a long time. Aluminium or Plastic or Glass? Finally, we selected acrylic with a gem gloss for a better feel and appearance. This material is also referred to as “Organic Glass”. The Organic Glass ensures not only the stability of the wireless signal, but also provides a crystal clear look that aluminum can’t.</p>
<p><b>5. Will Siring work with Android or Windows phones?</b></p>
<p>There is support planned for Android but currently not for Blackberry or Windows Phone at the moment.</p>
<p><b>6. Do I need to pay for the shipping fee?</b></p>
<p>No shipping fee is required. The shipping fee is already counted as part of the pledge. We will send our product to every backer in November, 2014 if everything goes well. The only issue will be that backers from different locations may receive Siring at different times because of different shipping distances. </p>

</div></div>","Siring has One Light and One Button. Siring is like the mouse of a PC; but much more, and for the iPhone. With just one press of your thumb, you can remotely accomplish almost all the daily functions of your iPhone.  Remotely wake up Siri, be notified of new messages, reject or make phone calls, press the button once to unlock your phone, play/pause/skip music and a 30-Day rechargeable battery life. And More.(An Android version of Siring will be released later on down the road.)
With One Button and One Light, Siring Creates Infinite Possibilities!

The iPhone has been a big part of our lives. We may think we control the iPhone, but maybe it controls us. We always hold it in our hands. Or are we in the hands of the iPhone? We want to regain the power.
Siring is simple, powerful and beautiful. It will completely change the way we use the iPhone.

(Note that currently Black, Gold, and Silver are available - Blue and Fuchsia could be future stretch goals - stay tuned!)




1. Notifications and Communication 

Be notified of incoming calls, emails and chat messages


Reject or make phone calls









2. Control Apps


Wake up Siri


Play/stop/skip music players, such as iTunes, Spotify
Take selfie pictures more easily with your friends 
Record/Pause Recording apps. Such as Voice Memos, AudioMemos

And more!









3. Use iPhone6 Plus with One Hand
How can you operate the iPhone6 with One Hand easily?Here is our solution!Assign the single or short press ring button method to return to the home screen, double press to switch tasks, and long press to wake up Siri. Along with One Press to Unlock feature illustrated below.Siring can replace Home Button completely. You can use you phone with one hand even if it’s the 5.5-inch screen of the iPhone6 Plus. How cool is that!?






4. One Press to Unlock Your Phone

You can set up your phone's unlock-screeen password in Siring's accompanying app.Then you can press once to unlock your phone, saving tons of tedious time spent inputting 4, 8, or more numeric digits for your password! In this way you don't need to remember this lengthy password anymore!







5. Make Your Devices SmarterSiring can work with headphones, smart watches, and other Bluetooth devices to dramatically improve product performance and user experience.




 



First, download and open Siring's accompanying app.

Second, pair Siring with your iPhone (make sure your iPhone's Bluetooth is working). 


Then you can set the light to display different colors to indicate different kinds of incoming messages. You can also assign different button press methods to achieve actions specified in the Siring's app.


    Enjoy Siring! 


You can download our app in the iTunes App Store and discover more secrets inside Siring. We will continue to enrich Siring's functionality, and over time you’ll be able to update the app to get the newest functions of Siring.
We will support Android soon.Month-long Battery Life

iPad® (3rd generation and later)

An Android version of Siring will be released later on down the road.

All men and women are created equal.Life, Liberty, and Lust for Creativity.This is our belief.And Siring is our Proof.
Here is an introduction of our talented team:



Founder and Product Manager: Frank Zheng (Creator of Siring)

Chief Marketing Officer: Zoe Lai (Focused on startup businesses for more than 3 years)


COO and International Marketing Manager: Jason Stine (Experienced in crowdfunding project management)

International Business Development: Anthony Paglino (Helps to grow startups across diverse cultural landscapes focusing on universal human themes of connectivity)

Hardware Design: Win Zhougang (not pictured) (4 years of hardware design experience at Huawei Technologies)
Hardware Design: Abel Jilei (not pictured) (also 4 years of hardware design experience at Huawei Technologies)











This amount will help us to manufacture the initial batches of Siring:$17,000: to create molds of different sizes and to prepare production materials.$8,000: to prepare PCBA components and other miscellaneous hardware items.$5,000: to cover shipping and logistics expenses. 
Ideally, we aim to crowdfund more than this amount so we can establish a more formal company and continue to produce and improve Siring. However, regardless of whether we reach this goal, all backers who preorder through Indiegogo will receive their rings! 
Our challenge over the next two months is to refine the product by testing it in labs, begin to make product molds, and arrange manufacturing in order to produce a quality product.


The risk is simply that we don’t have enough money to buy all the components until enough funds are raised through the website. In addition, there is an important component (the Bluetooth antenna) that will take 6-8 weeks to order, which may lead to production delays, and thus a minor delivery delay of a couple weeks.
It should take on average 10 days to receive our product after the fundraising campaign, and may take 20-30 days in special situations. Because our users are from all over the world, everyone will receive the product at a different time. To that extent, please be patient.

<h3>Story</h3>
<p>Galdoran, the last sorcerer Of Casa de Diosa, has been dead for forty years. With the destruction of his heartstone his lifeforce has dissipated and his influence faltered. Although, peace has taken time to return no major wars have threatened the fifteen peoples since his final death.</p>
<p>However, as the great war begins to fade from memory a decaying boat washes ashore bearing the corpse of Jonathan Wintercloak, the knight presumed killed in his quest to destroy Galdoran, and within his decaying chest, is a new heartstone pulsing with light…</p>
<h3>Game Description Here</h3>
<p>An introduction to the rules, species, magic and lands of Endara, a rich tabletop fantasy RPG setting. <em>The Isle of Hearts</em> is a setting first containing a strong overview of the world and more detailed information about the continent, cultures, and fifteen playable species that players will encounter in the sample campaign.</p>
<p>The game provides a light and flexible system of rules that can be modified or bent to the fit the situation with a minimum of fuss and requires only a single D10 to play. The game provided in this book are complete in and of itself; future installments to this series will expand upon the sample campaign and provide more detailed information about the rest of the world and its peoples, as well as brilliant artwork.</p>
<h3>What's the Money for?</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>The Isle of Hearts is a book headed rapidly towards completion. Interior and cover illustrations are coming together nicely, and the final editing is rapidly approaching completion. Thanks to the excellent work of Yukimi Mills and James Turner Mahoan, the illustrators on the project, the book is going to have some really gorgeous artwork to help bring the it to life.</p>
<p>While writing, illustrations, design, and editing are all paid for, but as any seasoned role player can tell you; a hardcover edition of the book is often preferable to a soft cover edition due to its ability to lay flat and stay open. Hardcovers are also built to last longer.</p>
<p>With this in mind we'd really like to give readers and fans the opportunity to own the book in a high-quality hardcover edition. Unfortunately, quality hardcover printing costs quite a lot and we're running short of the cost of a print run.</p>
<p>By contributing to our campaign The Isle of Hearts, you are helping to fund a limited edition hardcover of the book. No further hardcovers of this edition will be printed beyond this first run. Should we meet our goal, but have copies left over after the campaign they will be sold at conventions, to libraries, or other venues until the supply is depeleted. After that the book will only be available in a soft cover edition or in PDF format. Your generosity during this campaign will help ensure as many players as possible have the opportunity to recieve the highest quality version of the book and help to spread word about our unique setting and campains.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal of $7,000 is the bare minimum needed to do a high quality print run of the book in hardcover. Although we will be able to fulfill hardcover pre-orders of the book whether or not we meet the funding goal, the quality of the hardcovers produced will be lessened and we will take a slight loss on each book printed; well worth it to get books into the hands of new readers and fans, but unfortunately not a sustainable practice and we would only be able to supply exactly the number of books preordered through the campaign. Other readers would never have the opportunity to own a hardcover copy of the book.</p>
<p>The $7,000 requested goes entirely to the production and shipping costs of the book; if we meet this goal we will simply break even and have some additional hardcover books left over for sale at conventions as a result of the minimum order size for quality printing and binding.</p>
<p>If we fail to meet our funding goals we will take a small personal loss, but still be able to spread some quality hardcovers to all of you, our readers.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>We'd really appreciate it if you help spread the word. Even if you can't donate, maybe you know someone who would be interested in helping us meet our goal. Or maybe you know somebody who knows somebody, every little bit helps and we really appreciate anything you can do.</p>

<h2 style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;"">Short Summary</h2>
<p style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;"">Hi! We are Vasilis Georgitzikis, Maria Kousta, Markellos Orfanos, Stelios Tsampas and Dimitris Amaxilatis, and we are the team behind codebender. In the past, each of us has worked on quite a few projects you might know, like MacPorts, Growl, the Arduino TFTP bootloader and we even had a project featured on hackaday. None of it comes close to our work on codebender though.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;"">codebender comes to fill the need for reliable and easy to use tools for makers. A need that from our own experience could not be totally fulfilled by any of the existing solutions. Things like installing libraries, updating the software or installing the IDE can be quite a painful process.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;"">In addition to the above, the limited features provided (e.g. insufficient highlighting, indentation and autocompletion) got us starting building codebender, a completely web-based IDE, that requires no installation and offers a great code editor. It also stores your sketches on the cloud.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;"">That way, you can still access your sketches safely even if your laptop is stolen or your hard drive fails! codebender also takes care of compilation, giving you extremely descriptive warnings on terrible code. On top of that, when you are done, you can upload your code to your Arduino straight from the browser without installing anything.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;"">Alright, so we need you to help us get started. We want to keep codebender open to everyone, with no restrictions, no fees or subscriptions. We need your help to raise at least $ 5000 to cover our hosting and operating costs for the first year. If we raise more, all the extra funds will go to further improvements on our infrastructure and features. If we raise less, it will still go to covering our hosting and operational costs for as long as possible, and we will try to find alternate methods to keep going. We are not going to give up that easy.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;"">We'll be offering exclusive access for the first couple of months, to see what people think, and iron out any rough spots. You will also get a monthly update of the status of the project, behind-the-scenes, new features and info on the development process. Be the first one to use codebender and the first one to hear the news!</p>
<p style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;"">We are also offering exclusive, limited edition t-shirts with the codebender logo (available only to the codebender developers and you), never to be printed again! Get yours today! For the pioneers among you, we offer an Arduino Ethernet pre-loaded with our next-gen bootloader which lets you upload sketches not only from the USB but also using TFTP to flash your projects through the network to any Internet connected Arduino.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;"">For our biggest supporters, we are offering a place of eternal glory on our website! Donate $500 and you will be listed as a supporter on our About page, or donate $1000 and you or your company will be listed on our front page! Let the whole world know how cool you are!</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;"">The Impact</h2>
<p style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;"">codebender does all of the above (and we will do more in the near future as we are working on some more cool stuff) while being completely open source and free to use! We deeply believe in the open source philosophy and we embrace it in everything we do. codebender, the compiler, the bootloader and the Java Applet we use to talk to the Arduino are all completely open.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;"">The Arduino bootloader we are working on will enable you to program your Arduino Ethernet or Arduino /w Ethernet Shield remotely through the network. That means you will be able to program any Arduino through the network using standard tools or straight from codebender, without the need to pull your project apart or connect it to your computer, from anywhere in the world!</p>
<p style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;"">But that's not all. We're taking it a step further. We would like to improve collaboration between makers, so we are building tools to help the maker community grow and collaborate easier. You can search for projects, clone them and exchange ideas with each other. Together, we can make this a reality. You can help us build a collaboration hub for the maker community, and we can help you breathe life to your next awesome project faster and easier!</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;"">Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;"">You can also help us by spreading the word for codebender to friends, family and colleagues. As a reward for your help we will be offering exclusive access to some of you as well. For twitter lovers, we'll be giving away 10 beta invites per day for the next week. Follow us,send a tweet containing @codebender_cc or #codebender and get a chance to win one of the 10 daily invites!

<h1><b>Our Story</b></h1>
<p>It started with a
haircut. When Kyle was younger he went to a barbershop every six weeks or so to
get a haircut. Each visit he forgot what he got the time before and would be
forced to try to remember and describe how it looked when they were done last
time. He would often daydream about a system that the stylist could write down
what they did and have that info shared amongst other stylists in the company
and across multiple locations. This way, if he got someone different the next
time or if he had to visit another location, he wouldn’t run into this
problem. This idea quickly outgrew barbershops and extended to coffee shops,
restaurants, retail stores, and much more. </p>
<p><b>The general
purpose: </b>To supply businesses
with a tool that anticipates their customer’s needs so they may serve them
best.</p>
<p>We did many months of
research at coffee shops, restaurants, and malls taking advantage of our
environment to study customer and business behavior. The one thing we found was
that businesses don’t have the time to gather any information that would
enhance the customer experience (past an email address) and customers don’t
respond well to giving out their information if they don’t know how it’s going
to be used. The latter really got us thinking about how we can get a win-win
situation with both sides of the relationship. That’s when we started doing
research on personal information control. </p>

By giving customers their
own universal profile that companies request access to, ultimately flipping
the current customer relationship management model on its head, we discovered
an entirely new way to secure personal information and manage customers
efficiently and effectively at the same time.<p> </p><p><br/></p><h1><b>Our Products:</b></h1><p></p>
<p>We’ve been developing
Identity and Concierge for about a year. In that time we found that the CRM business
is an $18B industry and that private, universal digital identification is a

<p>From the beginning, we

<p>That might sound

people. Specifically, we didn't want to run a software company or a

technology, and discovering new opportunities to do something that matters—something
meaningful for the world. Creating thoughtful applications that can be
appreciated equally for its clever uses, outstanding beauty, and ease of use is
deeply ingrained in our DNA. Currently, our team is comprised of two
individuals who are extremely passionate about helping others, especially with
technology:</p>
<p>Kyle is
Co-Founder and CEO of Human Planet. With an obsession with customer service and an unmatched love for all people, Kyle is responsible for setting
the overall direction and product strategy for the company. He leads the design
of Human Planet's services and development of its core technology and
infrastructure. Kyle loves making people smile so much that he sometimes anonymously buys Starbucks for
the rest of the line.</p>
<p>Andrew is
Co-Founder and CTO of Human Planet. Growing up with a database and software genius as a father, Andrew ended up becoming a computer scientist himself with great fervor for helping others with the technology he builds. With this passion,<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> he's improved face-to-face collaboration between more than 20 sites for Logitech, Inc. worldwide, and drove innovation in the way videoconferencing technology was utilized on a day-to-day basis.

</ul><p>Imagine an ergonomic keyboard that’s so great, people would be willing to buy it in bits and pieces and solder it on their own. A mechanical keyboard, fully customizable to your needs. Such a keyboard exists: the ErgoDox. But why should it be so hard to get?</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454531328/y1tsm6oivwn1yg4yv3ot.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Those were our thoughts as we drooled over the ErgoDox only a few months ago. Right now, you can only get this keyboard as a kit which you must solder together on your own, and these kits are available only once in a while. We're geeks, but we're not really into soldering tiny components at home.</span></p><p>We looked around and realized we're not alone. The ErgoDox is a proven design. People want this keyboard — and for good reason — but not everyone wants to spend hours, days, even months putting it together. We decided to do something about it.</p><p>Introducing: <b>The ErgoDox EZ!</b> The ErgoDox is an <a href=""http://www.ergodox.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">open-source design</a>, the concept belongs to the community. Now, we have the opportunity to make it into a complete product anyone can buy. Take it out of the box, plug it in, and start enjoying an amazing typing experience, warranty included. It’s not a kit: It’s a keyboard.</p><h1 style=""padding-top:20px;"">What makes the ErgoDox great</h1><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447294843/dm3omkn8mc9ybwk5yeqj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div><ul>
<li>It’s a tactile, mechanical keyboard. Mechanical key switches offer a satisfying feel and make for a much better typing experience.</li>
<li>The ErgoDox comes in two halves, connected by a standard cable (with 3.5mm jacks on each end — not something custom you’re going to lose). This means you can place each half exactly where you want it, for maximum typing comfort.</li>
<li>It’s one of the most powerful programmable keyboards on the planet. Powered by a <a href=""https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Teensy microcontroller</a> and running open-source firmware, you can customize the ErgoDox's key layout in almost any way you can imagine.</li>
<li>Right now, you can choose between two main kinds of assembled mechanical keyboards: You have the compact “retro” ones like the Happy Hacking keyboard, or the large ergonomic ones like the Kinesis Advantage. The ErgoDox is a mechanical keyboard design that is both compact and ergonomic.</li>
<li>Just like high-end headphones have an audio jack rather than a fixed cable, so does the ErgoDox: It comes with a USB jack (and a standard cable in the box, of course). This makes it easy to transport, and means you can always replace the cable.</li>
</ul><p>ErgoDox kits are wonderful, and the fact that the design is open and anyone can manufacture it is great. We claim no copyright or any other exclusivity over the ErgoDox: We merely wish to make this keyboard available to anyone who wants it, regardless of their soldering ability.</p><p>The ErgoDox EZ comes as you would expect a keyboard to come: Assembled, in a box, with everything you need. It has a comprehensive 2-year warranty, it’s made in Taiwan, and it’s awesome.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447294995/d293cnycxt7rplaqxdsu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><span style=""font-size: 36px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 1px;line-height: 40px;background-color: initial;"">The ErgoDox EZ Wing</span></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442012955/u8ritul33msrlp4rjrp6.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Made of a rigid silicon-like polymer (more expensive than ABS plastic), the Wing is a black and substantial custom-molded wrist rest for the ErgoDox EZ.

Imagine an ergonomic keyboard that’s so great, people would be willing to buy it in bits and pieces and solder it on their own. A mechanical keyboard, fully customizable to your needs. Such a keyboard exists: the ErgoDox. But why should it be so hard to get?Those were our thoughts as we drooled over the ErgoDox only a few months ago. Right now, you can only get this keyboard as a kit which you must solder together on your own, and these kits are available only once in a while. We're geeks, but we're not really into soldering tiny components at home.We looked around and realized we're not alone. The ErgoDox is a proven design. People want this keyboard — and for good reason — but not everyone wants to spend hours, days, even months putting it together. We decided to do something about it.Introducing: The ErgoDox EZ! The ErgoDox is an open-source design, the concept belongs to the community. Now, we have the opportunity to make it into a complete product anyone can buy. Take it out of the box, plug it in, and start enjoying an amazing typing experience, warranty included. It’s not a kit: It’s a keyboard.What makes the ErgoDox great
It’s a tactile, mechanical keyboard. Mechanical key switches offer a satisfying feel and make for a much better typing experience.
The ErgoDox comes in two halves, connected by a standard cable (with 3.5mm jacks on each end — not something custom you’re going to lose). This means you can place each half exactly where you want it, for maximum typing comfort.
It’s one of the most powerful programmable keyboards on the planet. Powered by a Teensy microcontroller and running open-source firmware, you can customize the ErgoDox's key layout in almost any way you can imagine.
Right now, you can choose between two main kinds of assembled mechanical keyboards: You have the compact “retro” ones like the Happy Hacking keyboard, or the large ergonomic ones like the Kinesis Advantage. The ErgoDox is a mechanical keyboard design that is both compact and ergonomic.
Just like high-end headphones have an audio jack rather than a fixed cable, so does the ErgoDox: It comes with a USB jack (and a standard cable in the box, of course). This makes it easy to transport, and means you can always replace the cable.
ErgoDox kits are wonderful, and the fact that the design is open and anyone can manufacture it is great. We claim no copyright or any other exclusivity over the ErgoDox: We merely wish to make this keyboard available to anyone who wants it, regardless of their soldering ability.The ErgoDox EZ comes as you would expect a keyboard to come: Assembled, in a box, with everything you need. It has a comprehensive 2-year warranty, it’s made in Taiwan, and it’s awesome.  The ErgoDox EZ Wing Made of a rigid silicon-like polymer (more expensive than ABS plastic), the Wing is a black and substantial custom-molded wrist rest for the ErgoDox EZ. Carefully contoured to match the signature curve of the ErgoDox EZ, the Wing comes as a separate accessory. This allows you to change the distance between the Wing and the ErgoDox EZ for optimum comfort during your day. We found there is no one perfect distance: Different times of day call for different postures.The Wing's polymer has very little give to it. It isn't soft or squishy, and most important, it isn't tacky. It's about as hard as a fully inflated bicycle tire, with a premium, substantial feel to it (just don't bludgeon anyone with it, please).  The Wing is only available to customers who order the ErgoDox EZ. The ErgoDox EZ Tilt/Tent KitThis is something the ErgoDox has never had before: A way to tilt and tent the keyboard in an adjustable angle. Yes -- there are solutions out there that allow you to tilt the ErgoDox at an angle, but it's one angle. Our tilt/tent kit, made up of six metal legs with rubber feet, makes it possible to fully control both the tilt (front-to-back) and tent (side-to-side) angle of your ErgoDox EZ, and change it anytime you like. It will also make it look like a keyboard spider from the future, squatting on your desk.The metal legs connect to metal inserts built into the body of the ErgoDox EZ. Both sides of this metal-to-metal connection have knurles or teeth, which means that once you have the tilt/tent legs in position, they won't be going anywhere. Just put the legs in the exact angle you like, tighten the included thumb screws, and you're done -- these will withstand a lot of pressure. Finally, you can have your ErgoDox EZ at exactly the right angle. Below are some photos of our early prototypes for this stretch goal. We've been working on this for a while and ran through some wildly different ideas until we ended up with this design. One of the legs directly supports the thumb area, allowing for very sturdy tenting:The other two legs support the back part of the assembly, and each is individually adjustable of course:And here's an example of a pretty extreme tilt (front-to-back angle), just one of many ways you could use the kit:And here is the final tilt/tent kit, as manufactured: And one of the keyboard with the kit assembled:   Picking your key switches  One of the most important aspects of a mechanical keyboard is the key switches, and we're offering seven different types for you to choose from.Each key on a mechanical keyboard hides an actual physical switch under it, rather than a squishy rubber membrane like on most keyboards. Typing on a mechanical keyboard is a very different experience from typing on a regular one.The keys have more travel, and everything is more tactile. Mechanical keyboards have their own unique sound, and you don't have to press the keys all the way down to get a reaction, which makes typing easier on the fingers.The ErgoDox EZ comes with Gateron Brown key switches by default, but you can choose a different type of switch when ordering. If you’d like to choose a different type of key switch, there are several things you should consider:
How much noise do you want your keyboard to make? Do you want a clicky switch or non-clicky switch?
Do you prefer a smoother typing experience, or do you want to feel a slight bump when the key is actuated? Do you want a linear or a tactile switch?
How much force do you want to use when typing on your keyboard?

</li></ul></div>We already have wireless internet and wireless phones. Why ,then ,are our mobile devices still shackled to the wall to be powered?  Finally ,there is a real wireless charging solution. Like most people Tariq Sawandi and Charles Thomas , co-founders of Dhat-Stone, LLC hated to lose power to their cellphone battery. So the two entrepreneurs and inventors started developing a Wireless smart battery they call BitEnergy.  They took a simple , universal problem and put together a simple ,elegant solution for it.<div>

The computer industry attempted to address this issue several years ago with the introduction of wireless induction chargers that unfortunately do not recharge your batteries beyond a charging kiosk or induction package.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>HOW IT ALL STARTED</b></div>
<div>One night in August 2011 , naturopath , inventor, entrepreneur, and software developer Dr. Tariq Sawandi went to bed in a motel and woke up with a vision for a smart battery that can be recharged through the cloud. At the time, Sawandi who wrote the quantum physics book ""The Quantum Signature of God"" , had discovered a way to apply quantum energy principles to recharging a battery using only digital codes.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Unhappy with the low battery life of mobile technology Sawandi began searching for alternative gadgets that could recharge a battery wirelessly using binary code energy. Basic versions of such devices existed for more than a decade but the energy companies have continuously suppressed such technologies over the years. They would prefer consumers to keep plugging into their electrical outlets which rack of billions of dollars in profits. However,  in recent years advances in digital circuitry and low energy sensors have helped developers radically improve the designs to make wireless energy transmission more efficient.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Sawandi and Thomas believe that the battery industry is entrenched in antiquated thinking. They want to push the boundaries of battery technology by reinventing the box. The Dhat-Stone team wants to develop and deploy a smart battery in as little as one year. If so , mobile technology is on the cusp of a new revolution!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b><i>THE  QUANTUM ENERGY GENERATOR (QEG) BREAKTHROUGH</i></b></div>
<div>Sawandi was able to think about the problem of charging a mobile phone literally from a quantum physics principle down to atoms and electrons. This led to a breakthrough with the quantum energy generator (QEG) circuit which converts binary energy into electricity.</div>
<div>Tariq Sawandi and Dr. Charles Thomas explored a strange quantum mechanism to amplify digital codes  into electron current flow. Their invention has caused a stir because it invokes quantum mechanics the branch of physics that describes the behavior of particles in the subatomic realm. Their Idea gives some insight into the process of ""digital-energy "" which has been overlooked by engineers and physicists and in short can lead to the development of wireless internet charging.</div>
<div>The BitEnergy Smart Battery is scoffed at , however , sparking  incredulity from both venture capitalists (VC's ) and old electronic engineers because quantum effects supposedly hold sway only on the smallest scales and cannot be amplified enough to recharge a mobile phone battery. ""I have since realized that some of the best ideas come out of seemingly crazy thoughts, because, otherwise they wouldn't be new."" says Tariq Sawandi. </div>
<div>With the formation of Dhat Stone Quantum Information Technologies LLC , Tariq Sawandi and Charles Thomas aims to provide users of mobile devices with an energy generating device that eliminates the need for charging cell phones with cords and electrical outlets. ""Its like having a mini generator attached to your phone"", Tariq Sawandi says of that BitEnergy technology. </div>

<div>BitEnergy is a disruptive technology that can be tremendously empowering and affordable in developing countries such as Africa and India where electrical power grids are poor. Mobile is the future, but throughout the developing world in regions such as Africa it's not about smartphones - the basic limitation is electrical power. Cellphones require recharge to help people make money-transfers, to communicate during disasters, connecting to health care services and education, or helping those in poverty to run a business.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>In many parts of Africa and India, people get their electric power from deficient electrical-grids. Because of decades of ineffective government control, electricity isin critically short supply. In Lagos, Nigeria every household store depends on diesel generators. Many sit in the dark in an upscale hotel waiting for a generator to kick in. Its unbearable.</div>

<div>Dhat-Stone,  LLC is seeking $20,000 to develop ,design, and license our BitEnergy Smart Battery. We have partnered with Davison.com Design &amp; Development Corporation,  and HLH prototypes two top quality prototype developers in the U.S. They will assist us in integrated product rendering presentation and complete design and development of the final BitEnergy device. We will use the funds to complete the final prototype model and the BitEnergy Recharge App, which will cost about $10,000. We also need another $10,000 to build a web-site and hire a consultant in supply chain management and Sales to target the U.S., Africa , Europe , the Middle East ,and Asian markets.  We expect to release our product by December 2015. Here is the total breakdown of the expensives to fund our project:</div>
<div><i>BREAKDOWN OF EXPENSIVES:</i></div>
<div>- $2, 700 to produce the CNC mold for the final BitEnergy Smart Battery module design.</div>
<div>- $3, 800 will go towards completing the BitEnergy Recharge App source code.</div>
<div>- $2, 000 to hire a branding and marketing team to bring BitEnergy to global markets.</div>
<div>- Another $2, 500 to set up a web-site and cloud datacenter to service users of the BitEnergy Recharge Cloud service.</div>
<div>- $5, 000 to lease office space and provide a sales force team.</div>
<div>- $4, 000 will go towards the cost to packaging and manufacturing the BitEnergy Smart Battery and deliver to our backers and customers.</div>
<div>We expect to deliver our product to our backers by December 2015 - just in time for Christmas!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>WHY WE CHOSE INDIGOGO CROWD FUNDING:</b></div>
<div> We're choosing to build a product that provides the user with a device that cuts out the middleman and empower the consumer to self connect the Smart Battery to their existing cell phones. This will give the user direct access to digital recharge through a cloud based service,  rather than depending on smartphone makers to integrate it into their devices. Thre BitEnergy Recharge App which supports the smart battery will be developed into Android and iOS phone versions. We're trying to create a solid app where the user will never have to worry about losing power to their phone. We think we can lead an entire new movement in Internet Recharge Technology.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><i><b>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</b></i></div>
<div>It has taken already about three years to be where we are today with the BitEnergy chip &amp; software app and it has been a great challenge from a design and development perspective to achieve such a great and revolutionary wireless technology.</div>
<div>The hardest part of designing the initial prototype was producing enough voltage to fully recharge a lithium Ion battery. Eventually after experimenting with the (GAN) transistors, we were able to produce up to 1000 volts.  This was enough voltage to recharge conventional mobile device batteries. </div>
<div>We face the final major task of bringing all the materials and elements together through programming , building , and testing the prototype. For example , the energy producing quantum generator needs to be scaled to fit into different mobile devices and to recharge a battery in a short amount of time. At this stage of our design, we foresee this as the largest hurdle aside from the normal challenges involved in any hardware and software development. To reduce the risk and challenge we have partnered with a technology think tank team called Davison a brilliant team of prototype designers and developers and engineers out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. This provides us added  insurance and confidence to reach full product development by December 2015. Our in- house design team has spent a considerable amount of time constructing the base prototype model of the BitEnergy technology and we believe we have greatly reduced the challenges involved.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>OUR MISSION:</b></div>
<div>We are a startup software company and we want to make a difference , we love the community and we're hoping you'll want to make our project successful. We want to provide an alternative to today's tangle of charger cords and wires. HELP US START THIS DIGITAL REVOLUTION NOW! </div>

WHY WE CHOSE INDIGOGO CROWD FUNDING:
 We're choosing to build a product that provides the user with a device that cuts out the middleman and empower the consumer to self connect the Smart Battery to their existing cell phones. This will give the user direct access to digital recharge through a cloud based service,  rather than depending on smartphone makers to integrate it into their devices. Thre BitEnergy Recharge App which supports the smart battery will be developed into Android and iOS phone versions. We're trying to create a solid app where the user will never have to worry about losing power to their phone. We think we can lead an entire new movement in Internet Recharge Technology.

RISKS & CHALLENGES
It has taken already about three years to be where we are today with the BitEnergy chip & software app and it has been a great challenge from a design and development perspective to achieve such a great and revolutionary wireless technology.
The hardest part of designing the initial prototype was producing enough voltage to fully recharge a lithium Ion battery. Eventually after experimenting with the (GAN) transistors, we were able to produce up to 1000 volts.  This was enough voltage to recharge conventional mobile device batteries. 
We face the final major task of bringing all the materials and elements together through programming , building , and testing the prototype. For example , the energy producing quantum generator needs to be scaled to fit into different mobile devices and to recharge a battery in a short amount of time. At this stage of our design, we foresee this as the largest hurdle aside from the normal challenges involved in any hardware and software development. To reduce the risk and challenge we have partnered with a technology think tank team called Davison a brilliant team of prototype designers and developers and engineers out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. This provides us added  insurance and confidence to reach full product development by December 2015. Our in- house design team has spent a considerable amount of time constructing the base prototype model of the BitEnergy technology and we believe we have greatly reduced the challenges involved.

OUR MISSION:
We are a startup software company and we want to make a difference , we love the community and we're hoping you'll want to make our project successful. We want to provide an alternative to today's tangle of charger cords and wires. HELP US START THIS DIGITAL REVOLUTION NOW!",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

Patented Crowd Search is a remote search function which other FOBO TAG app users can help locate a missing item when they come in Bluetooth range with a FOBO TAG.   With Bluetooth 5 wireless technology, FOBO TAG gets detected from afar, 4 times the range of other trackers of Bluetooth 4. (USA – Patent No. US9485613 B2)
 
Reverse Search helps you search for the smartphone that the FOBO TAG is paired with. This function is handy when you have misplaced your phone. If you have multiple TAGs paired with your phone, you can mobilize a team search by assigning one TAG to each team member.  2. TrackME shows ON DEMAND the presence of items that you would like to track. It provides an instant summary view of those FOBO TAG that are in Bluetooth range with your smartphone. This function is handy when you have to move about with multiple belongings like during a family vacation or tracking expensive tools in a construction environment.  3. RemindME alerts you when a tracked item gets out of Bluetooth range with your smartphone, reminding that the item has been left behind or alerting that the item has been taken away or wandered off. This function stops LOSS. 
SafeZone is a patented feature that allows the FOBO TAG app to drop its guard on a tracked item at a location where you need to detach from the item.  You can set a preferred perimeter in which the RemindME function is turned off for the said tracked item.  This is a useful feature when you need to detach from the item within a safe perimeter, like at home. (USA Patent No. US9614952 B2)  
TimeZone is a patented feature that turns off the RemindME function during a time frame you set so that you can detach with the tracked item beyond the perimeter set for SafeZone. This feature is useful when you intentionally leaves a tracked item in the office when having lunch away from office.  4. PromptME alerts you when a tracked item comes in Bluetooth range with your smartphone.  It is useful for parents who fetch children from school events; the tracked FOBO TAG will also beep when gets in range telling the children that their parents are waiting by. A traveler can avoid the crowd and approach the airport carousel upon getting a notification as the luggages turn up and get in range with the smartphone(FOBO TAG should be leashed on the bag exterior).  5. Don’tMoveMe is a motion detection function that alerts you when the tracked item is moved.  This is a safety feature that you would love when traveling alone to alert you if there is a movement of the hotel room door.  You can also use to detect movement of the lid of a candy jar.  If the tracked item is moved when you are away, you will still get an alert when you return; a movement log is provided.  You can use this feature in a busy airport to alert you against luggage theft(FOBO TAG should be leashed on the bag exterior). 
FOBO Share allows two users to track the same FOBO TAG together or separately.  This patented feature also shows the detached user whether the tracked item is with the other user.  When both of the users are detached from the tracked item, they will be alerted at once, even if they are not at the same location.

</div></section></div>","Wireless doorbells are quite common nowadays, but what makes Linbell stand out is the fact that it doesn’t need batteries or an external power supply.

Linbell is easy to install, requires no wiring and requires no battery replacement.
 

 

 
 
 
 
 

 
Stick or install the transmitter anywhere you like
 
 
 
 

 

 

 
Get multiple receivers if afraid to miss the bell ring
 

 
Linbell is programmed with 36 types of ring tones and adjustable on the volume. Pick the favorite one for you and family!
36 types of tones, adjustable volume
Linbell is entirely self-sufficient, converting the kinetic energy of the switch actuation into a voltage pulse, powering an RF transmitter and sending signals to the receiver.

 

 
 
 
 

 
The Linbell energy harvesting kit is an easy-to-use feature for a better user experience.

 

 
There are 2 transmitters, 1 receiver, and 1 Evaluation board in the kit.
The transmitter contains a energy harvester and a wireless PCB. When you press the transmitter, it will transmit wireless signal and the receiver will receive the signal and output digital ""1"" or RS232 digital message.
The evaluation board contains a connection unit for RS232 to USB, one reset key, and one buzzer. You can see the communication message by a serial digital numbers on the computer. 

 

Explore what you can do with the Linbell energy harvesting kit!

We want to get back to typing on a fully tactile keyboard whilst being able to view the entire screen. All this on a device no larger than most modern mobile phones.</p><p>We decided to re-invent the palm-sized keyboard mobile device that will benefit many, who we think are missing using the keyboard on the move. From bloggers and creatives that need to constantly write, to professionals who need to read and write e-mail, create and edit documents and spreadsheets.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488155004/hxs5wybpmsbg7uvoanyy.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Gemini is a modern clam-shell based mobile device with a fully integrated palm-sized keyboard. </p><p>To ensure Gemini has the lineage and continuity of the clamshell PDA designs, and to have the best mobile keyboard design on the market, we partnered up with Martin Riddiford and his London-based product design consultancy, Therefore, who were instrumental in the design of the Psion PDAs of the 1990s. In terms of software we partnered up with Private Planet, a leading supplier of applications and personal cloud solutions for mobile operators such as T-Mobile and Etisalat. The Planet Computers team each has over 20 years experience of software and hardware delivery.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488158167/ebxxe2refz88xokzpum4.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The result of our work with Therefore is a beautiful piece of design, befitting the device we want to create. The hardware is based on a leading reference design based on a 10-core state-of-the-art mobile processor.</p><p>Gemini features a sleek metal clamshell design that is perfectly balanced for typing when open and beautifully tucks away the palm-sized QWERTY keyboard and screen when closed. It fits into a pocket, roughly the same size as most of today's mobile phones. When open, the innovative clamshell also acts as a support of the device. The ultra-wide 5.99"" hi-res screen provides ample space for creating on the go. The fully tactile keyboard is recognised as the world's best yet smallest full-sized keyboard for finger touch typing. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488154885/bw7lklfschumfndba9ej.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>We plan to have two versions of Gemini: one model with WiFi only; and the other fully equipped with WiFi and 4G mobile communications. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505160485/dzubqw3sjxdo2gt4x8sm.png"" src=""""/></p><h3><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Features:</strong></span></h3><ul>

Meet Gemini, the 21st century pocket computer""ZDNet: ""Psion reborn? But this time it's Gemini PDA, an Android-Linux phone with full keyboard""Slash Gear: ""Gemini PDA brings back Psion days with Android/Linux pocket PC""MÓVIL EXPERTO: ""Gemini PDA, un proyecto interesante basado en Linux""Pc Watch: ""シャープの「NetWalker」の再来を彷彿とさせる5.7型のAndroid/Linuxデュアルブート端末""SummaryAt Planet Computers, we are passionate about typing, writing, being productive and creating on the go. Since the introduction of touchscreen mobile phones and tablets, we felt that it is very difficult to type on these types of devices. On-screen keyboards often take up more than half the readable screen. We want to get back to typing on a fully tactile keyboard whilst being able to view the entire screen. All this on a device no larger than most modern mobile phones.We decided to re-invent the palm-sized keyboard mobile device that will benefit many, who we think are missing using the keyboard on the move. From bloggers and creatives that need to constantly write, to professionals who need to read and write e-mail, create and edit documents and spreadsheets.Gemini is a modern clam-shell based mobile device with a fully integrated palm-sized keyboard. To ensure Gemini has the lineage and continuity of the clamshell PDA designs, and to have the best mobile keyboard design on the market, we partnered up with Martin Riddiford and his London-based product design consultancy, Therefore, who were instrumental in the design of the Psion PDAs of the 1990s. In terms of software we partnered up with Private Planet, a leading supplier of applications and personal cloud solutions for mobile operators such as T-Mobile and Etisalat. The Planet Computers team each has over 20 years experience of software and hardware delivery.The result of our work with Therefore is a beautiful piece of design, befitting the device we want to create. The hardware is based on a leading reference design based on a 10-core state-of-the-art mobile processor.Gemini features a sleek metal clamshell design that is perfectly balanced for typing when open and beautifully tucks away the palm-sized QWERTY keyboard and screen when closed. It fits into a pocket, roughly the same size as most of today's mobile phones. When open, the innovative clamshell also acts as a support of the device. The ultra-wide 5.99"" hi-res screen provides ample space for creating on the go. The fully tactile keyboard is recognised as the world's best yet smallest full-sized keyboard for finger touch typing. We plan to have two versions of Gemini: one model with WiFi only; and the other fully equipped with WiFi and 4G mobile communications. Features:
Two weeks of stand-by time / 12 hours of talk time (TBC)

If you have any suggestions of ways you think you can help, please don't hesitate to reach out to us by email (hello@planetcom.co.uk) or social media. We would love to hear from you.

<div>Even though it pains us to say it, we're a couple of middle aged dudes who wanted to do something cool to support some amazing charitable causes that help people on a day to day basis as well as make an awesome gadget that people will actually use! We like to say that we are ""Solving First world problems and REAL world problems"". Cool?</div>
<div>Here's how we want to do this - and ultimately what Charging for Change is all about.  We've created a super-slick looking rechargeable, portable charger that holds about 2 full smartphone charges that would easily fit in a pocket, a purse (or murse) a backpack, or whatever.   You can use it to charge pretty much any USB portable device when you inevitably need to (usually around 2:30 PM).  Its also a pretty effective conversation starter.  Pull it out in a restaurant and an attractive person will inevitably come over and say ""<i>Hey whats that</i>"", and you can say ""<i>its an awesome charger, but it also supports cancer research</i>"".  And they'll say, ""<i>You are awesome, and you have an awesome charger.  We should be soulmates</i>"".  </div>

<p>Don't worry though if your charitable cause of choice is not listed here.  We want to hear from you!  We love hearing (perhaps another cause?) and love hearing from you even more.</p>
</div>
<div>This Indiegogo campaign will help us create the budget for not just the first round of chargers, we'll also make more chargers so that we can raise even more funds for these causes.  </div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We are hoping to raise $40,000 or more!  The entire amount raised, less Indiegogo fees and other expenses will go to purchase as many Charging for Change chargers as possible.  We have already been approached about putting our chargers in certain retail establishments, but we would prefer to sell them directly.</p>
<p>We've given a ton of thought to how we structure the perks so that there are plenty of opportunities to contribute.  Almost all of our perks will give you at least one Charging for Change Charger in the color of your choice, but we've also added a couple of contributions which we think are really cool - one is called ""Show your Corporate Colors"".  This one is designed for a business or organizational contribution and we will deliver 40 chargers, in your choice of color - with the business or organization logo printed on the surface!</p>
<p>We really hope that everyone thinks that our chargers and support for causes are pretty awesome, but, in the event that we are wrong and we don't reach our goal, we are still going to make sure that everyone receives their gift for contributing!</p>

<br/><ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The goal of Charging for Change is twofold.  First of all, we want to make sure that we are raising awareness and funding some very worthy and needed charitable causes that will make a difference to the day to day lives of those who need it.  Secondly, we want to make sure that we provide a charger that is great looking, well made and reliable so that users can keep connected to their world!  </p>
<p>None of us can change the world on our own.  It is only by working together that we can make a positive change!  This is why we think that the Charging for Change Charger is so cool - it is a simple, inexpensive device that almost anyone needs and will use on a day to day basis, and as a result of so many people using it we can, in fact, make such a huge difference in the lives of others.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>So far, all funding for this project, including, but not limited to design, prototyping, creative, and corporate set-up expenses have been bootstrapped by us.  We don't have any external funding or any outside investor that we have to answer to.  We believe in Charging for Change and have already put our money where our hearts are.  </p>
<p>There are a number of challenges that we are up against.  Firstly, we many not meet our goal, and not even have enough money to cover our expenses.  That is fine because we knew what we were getting into.  Secondly, we could run into production issues  - quality or time - that could impact what we are doing.  Because of our demand for the best quality, we have been in touch with a number of potential manufacturing partners and have narrowed it to two vendors that can produce a quality product to our specification.  As such, if we run into problems with one, we can move to a back up for production. Third, we could run into scalability issues.  This means that we may have more demand than production and distribution space.  We think we are OK here.  We have two manufacturing partners who have more than adequate production capacity and our distribution partner has the capability to directly ship from three different Distribution Centers across the US.  If we do end up with this problem we are committed to either expanding our relationships with our partners or determining new partners  who can meet our needs.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<div>If you can't financially support Charging for Change we get it!  It's OK - Seriously! Not everyone can support everything, but if you'd like to give us a shout out on Facebook, twitter or instagram we'd really love it.</div>
<div>Indiegogo has these really easy sharing tools that will make it easy for you to share on your social network of choice!</div> <p><br/></p>

This Indiegogo campaign will help us create the budget for not just the first round of chargers, we'll also make more chargers so that we can raise even more funds for these causes.     What We Need & What You Get We are hoping to raise $40,000 or more!  The entire amount raised, less Indiegogo fees and other expenses will go to purchase as many Charging for Change chargers as possible.  We have already been approached about putting our chargers in certain retail establishments, but we would prefer to sell them directly.
We've given a ton of thought to how we structure the perks so that there are plenty of opportunities to contribute.  Almost all of our perks will give you at least one Charging for Change Charger in the color of your choice, but we've also added a couple of contributions which we think are really cool - one is called ""Show your Corporate Colors"".  This one is designed for a business or organizational contribution and we will deliver 40 chargers, in your choice of color - with the business or organization logo printed on the surface!
We really hope that everyone thinks that our chargers and support for causes are pretty awesome, but, in the event that we are wrong and we don't reach our goal, we are still going to make sure that everyone receives their gift for contributing!



  The Impact The goal of Charging for Change is twofold.  First of all, we want to make sure that we are raising awareness and funding some very worthy and needed charitable causes that will make a difference to the day to day lives of those who need it.  Secondly, we want to make sure that we provide a charger that is great looking, well made and reliable so that users can keep connected to their world!  
None of us can change the world on our own.  It is only by working together that we can make a positive change!  This is why we think that the Charging for Change Charger is so cool - it is a simple, inexpensive device that almost anyone needs and will use on a day to day basis, and as a result of so many people using it we can, in fact, make such a huge difference in the lives of others.




  Risks & Challenges So far, all funding for this project, including, but not limited to design, prototyping, creative, and corporate set-up expenses have been bootstrapped by us.  We don't have any external funding or any outside investor that we have to answer to.  We believe in Charging for Change and have already put our money where our hearts are.  
There are a number of challenges that we are up against.  Firstly, we many not meet our goal, and not even have enough money to cover our expenses.  That is fine because we knew what we were getting into.  Secondly, we could run into production issues  - quality or time - that could impact what we are doing.  Because of our demand for the best quality, we have been in touch with a number of potential manufacturing partners and have narrowed it to two vendors that can produce a quality product to our specification.  As such, if we run into problems with one, we can move to a back up for production. Third, we could run into scalability issues.  This means that we may have more demand than production and distribution space.  We think we are OK here.  We have two manufacturing partners who have more than adequate production capacity and our distribution partner has the capability to directly ship from three different Distribution Centers across the US.  If we do end up with this problem we are committed to either expanding our relationships with our partners or determining new partners  who can meet our needs.


  Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't financially support Charging for Change we get it!  It's OK - Seriously! Not everyone can support everything, but if you'd like to give us a shout out on Facebook, twitter or instagram we'd really love it.

Do you ride a motorcycle and struggle to keep your earphones or earplugs in when wearing a helmet? Do you find that your earphones hurt your ears after a while? Earcandi is a reusable, silicone based polymer that moulds around your earphones giving you a customised fit and ensures that they stay in your ears - 100% guaranteed, no matter what. Earcandi was born out of a desire for functional sports earphones that don't fall out or dislodge when engaging in physical activity. We have developed a solution to the problem of earphones falling out for when you need to focus on your sport and not mess around putting your earbuds back in your ears every 5 minutes.</p><p>Essentially, anything generic that fits in the ear can be customised with Earcandi. Because your ear shape is as unique as your fingerprint there is no ,'one size fits all' option that works fully. The cool thing about Earcandi is that in the same way as we are customising our phones with apps and printing stuff on our desktop in 3D, it's now possible to get away from the uncomfortable generic earphones with poor functionality and upgrade to something blueprinted exactly for you.</p><p></p><p><b>IMPORTANT!</b></p><p>Colours of Earcandi available to Indiegogo supporters are as follows:</p><p>Purple, blue, green, yellow, orange, pink, black and white.</p><p>When you choose your perk please indicate your preferred colour in the *name* section when filling out your name and address, e.g. Lloyd Daly: <b>YELLOW</b>. If you don't do this we will just assume you don't mind which colour you get and send you one at random.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/338644/files/20140130083019-02_earcandi_putty.jpg?1391099419"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/338642/files/20140130082926-05_how_it_works_header.jpg?1391099366"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Well, it's pretty simple. Earcandi kind of looks like play-doh, but you get a white part and a coloured part. Take the two parts out of their respective packaging and mix them together for about a minute - this sets in motion the curing process. Insert your earphones into your ears, split the resulting mix in two and just push it in around your earphones (or just in your ears for earplugs). Leave it for ten minutes to set, take them out and voila, Earcandi custom moulded earphones!</span><br/></p><p>The medical grade silicone polymer we use produces a soft, flexible and durable product which you can leave in your ears for hours without noticing. Noise isolation is greatly improved due to the exact fit you get with Earcandi, allowing you to play your music at lower volumes which reduces the chance of damaging your hearing by having to crank up the volume. For this reason audiologists will all emphasize there is no substitute for custom earphones. The silicone easily bonds to any earphones and will retain its shape permanently, giving you a soft, sturdy and comfortable set of custom earphones that will last.</p><p>Regular custom moulded earphones/monitors have been around for a while now, but for the majority of people they are prohibitively expensive. Earcandi are the first of their kind and solve the problem of cost by cutting out expensive elements of production such as visits to specialists for ear castings and injection moulding systems.We think we've struck a good balance with the Earcandi system - better than the 'one size fits all' approach of regular earbuds, but a fraction of the cost of expensive in-ear monitors.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/338648/files/20140130083116-06_how_it_works_image.jpg?1391099476"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/338649/files/20140130083151-07_who_can_use_earcandi_header.jpg?1391099511"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>Although sport is a huge part of our market, it isn't the only application for Earcandi and our unique Sonicone material can be used for a variety of other things as well. The secure, low profile fit ensures that when wearing a helmet for motorsport or motorcycle riding, you earphones will stay in even when the rumble strips and potholes are rattling out your fillings. You can also say goodbye to windrush as the perfect fit you get with Earcandi make this a thing of the past.</p><p>Musicians can also benefit from a custom fit for on stage in-ear monitors. Because they are moulded easily in only ten minutes at home, they are ten to one hundred times cheaper than the prohibitively expensive custom monitors professional musicians use.</p><p>In addition to this, Earcandi can be used without earphones to make custom moulded earplugs for anything from surfing to blocking out noise from the habitual snorer lying next to you. Earcandi particularly suits people who have trouble sleeping as the custom fit ensures that they are incredibly comfortable when lying down whilst providing excellent noise reduction.</p><p></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/338654/files/20140130083329-09_who_can_use_earcandi_image.jpg?1391099609"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/338655/files/20140130083358-03_our_story_header.jpg?1391099638"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>Hi, We're Lloyd and Steve - the guys behind earcandi. We're both pretty active people and participate in quite a few different sports - running, cycling, mountain biking, triathlon, snowboarding, climbing and kickboxing to name a few. Like many people we knew, we were completely fed up of our earphones constantly falling out whenever we did any kind of sport. Between us we'd tried all of the sports-fit styles, ear-buds and even these weird little cone things, (which either fell out or hurt our ears after about 10 minutes). We'd pretty much given up on being able to listen to music when we were moving around with any kind of intensity until Lloyd started messing around with a squidgy wax earplug whilst on holiday in Norway. Fast forward past Steve's kitchen, combining stinky bathroom sealant and various other bits and bobs and we hooked up with a medical silicone manufacturer who helped us formulate a much safer, softer and more colourful version of the original, smelly prototype. To this day, the first pair moulded have never fallen out, no matter what, not once - and we reckon that's pretty good going considering how often we find ourselves upside down when we should be the right way up. We're a young company trying to find our feet in the world of business, (the jeans and hoodies get some odd looks at meetings), but we reckon if we can do what we do well, offer our product at a reasonable price and look after and listen to our customers we should be alright. The feedback we have received on the product so far has been fantastic and the journey has been loads of fun, we're looking forward to seeing what's in store for the future and hope you join us for the ride...</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Lloyd and Steve :)</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/338658/files/20140130083436-04_our_story_image.jpg?1391099676"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/338665/files/20140130083649-13_why_funding.jpg?1391099809"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>At the moment we are in the process of building the website and designing packaging, logos and creating videos. As fun and challenging as this is, it all costs money - and we're running out! The companies we have been working with have been great and a some have such faith in the product that they are willing to accept payment further down the line, once we are into production. This has been a massive help and consolidates our opinion that Earcandi is a genuinely good idea. With a relatively small boost from the Indiegogo campaign we'll be able to source the raw materials we need and pay the packaging manufacturer to move us into full scale production.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/338667/files/20140130083732-01_Earcandi_Packaging_Front_v1.0.jpg?1391099852"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/338670/files/20140130083830-14_risks_challenges.jpg?1391099910"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We've been working on Earcandi for almost a year and had initially intended to launch in November 2013. We held back so that we could ensure the prototype formulation worked perfectly and so that we could speak to more factories to ensure they could cope with a potentially huge ramp-up in production. Comfortable that we can deliver this, we’re now launching Earcandi! </span><br/></p><p>Below are a couple of the main challenges we will tackle:</p><p>Choice of Factory: As with any physical item there are a number of challenges to getting it right. We have been part of numerous projects that have made it through development, into the factory production phase, and then into consumer hands. While our experiences have helped prepare us to avoid major pitfalls, we have been very selective in our choice of factory, choosing a partner that we know we can work with and that is perfect for our needs. They are large enough to scale Earcandi, but without being so big that we'll be lost amidst the shop floor, and they have a great development team. We also intend to spend a large amount of time in person at the factory.</p><p>Quality Control: Good QC is a major focus of ours. The quantity of orders on Indiegogo will help determine how we handle this. If we receive orders for under 1000 units, we will batch test ourselves at Earcandi HQ in Brighton. If we receive over 1000 orders we will carry out all QC in-situ at the factory, with the assistance of dedicated QC personnel.</p><p>We had an initial campaign on IGG that we wanted to extend as we felt we didn't have enough time to reach our target. Unfortunately the rules of IGG meant we couldn't do this, but as we have had offers of TV and magazine features we felt it was worth relaunching the campaign as these things would mean we would be likely to hit, or even exceed our target.<br/></p><p>This is about getting the best possible product into your hands ASAP.

Do you ride a motorcycle and struggle to keep your earphones or earplugs in when wearing a helmet? Do you find that your earphones hurt your ears after a while? Earcandi is a reusable, silicone based polymer that moulds around your earphones giving you a customised fit and ensures that they stay in your ears - 100% guaranteed, no matter what. Earcandi was born out of a desire for functional sports earphones that don't fall out or dislodge when engaging in physical activity. We have developed a solution to the problem of earphones falling out for when you need to focus on your sport and not mess around putting your earbuds back in your ears every 5 minutes.Essentially, anything generic that fits in the ear can be customised with Earcandi. Because your ear shape is as unique as your fingerprint there is no ,'one size fits all' option that works fully. The cool thing about Earcandi is that in the same way as we are customising our phones with apps and printing stuff on our desktop in 3D, it's now possible to get away from the uncomfortable generic earphones with poor functionality and upgrade to something blueprinted exactly for you.IMPORTANT!Colours of Earcandi available to Indiegogo supporters are as follows:Purple, blue, green, yellow, orange, pink, black and white.When you choose your perk please indicate your preferred colour in the *name* section when filling out your name and address, e.g. Lloyd Daly: YELLOW. If you don't do this we will just assume you don't mind which colour you get and send you one at random.Well, it's pretty simple. Earcandi kind of looks like play-doh, but you get a white part and a coloured part. Take the two parts out of their respective packaging and mix them together for about a minute - this sets in motion the curing process. Insert your earphones into your ears, split the resulting mix in two and just push it in around your earphones (or just in your ears for earplugs). Leave it for ten minutes to set, take them out and voila, Earcandi custom moulded earphones!The medical grade silicone polymer we use produces a soft, flexible and durable product which you can leave in your ears for hours without noticing. Noise isolation is greatly improved due to the exact fit you get with Earcandi, allowing you to play your music at lower volumes which reduces the chance of damaging your hearing by having to crank up the volume. For this reason audiologists will all emphasize there is no substitute for custom earphones. The silicone easily bonds to any earphones and will retain its shape permanently, giving you a soft, sturdy and comfortable set of custom earphones that will last.Regular custom moulded earphones/monitors have been around for a while now, but for the majority of people they are prohibitively expensive. Earcandi are the first of their kind and solve the problem of cost by cutting out expensive elements of production such as visits to specialists for ear castings and injection moulding systems.We think we've struck a good balance with the Earcandi system - better than the 'one size fits all' approach of regular earbuds, but a fraction of the cost of expensive in-ear monitors.Although sport is a huge part of our market, it isn't the only application for Earcandi and our unique Sonicone material can be used for a variety of other things as well. The secure, low profile fit ensures that when wearing a helmet for motorsport or motorcycle riding, you earphones will stay in even when the rumble strips and potholes are rattling out your fillings. You can also say goodbye to windrush as the perfect fit you get with Earcandi make this a thing of the past.Musicians can also benefit from a custom fit for on stage in-ear monitors. Because they are moulded easily in only ten minutes at home, they are ten to one hundred times cheaper than the prohibitively expensive custom monitors professional musicians use.In addition to this, Earcandi can be used without earphones to make custom moulded earplugs for anything from surfing to blocking out noise from the habitual snorer lying next to you. Earcandi particularly suits people who have trouble sleeping as the custom fit ensures that they are incredibly comfortable when lying down whilst providing excellent noise reduction.Hi, We're Lloyd and Steve - the guys behind earcandi. We're both pretty active people and participate in quite a few different sports - running, cycling, mountain biking, triathlon, snowboarding, climbing and kickboxing to name a few. Like many people we knew, we were completely fed up of our earphones constantly falling out whenever we did any kind of sport. Between us we'd tried all of the sports-fit styles, ear-buds and even these weird little cone things, (which either fell out or hurt our ears after about 10 minutes). We'd pretty much given up on being able to listen to music when we were moving around with any kind of intensity until Lloyd started messing around with a squidgy wax earplug whilst on holiday in Norway. Fast forward past Steve's kitchen, combining stinky bathroom sealant and various other bits and bobs and we hooked up with a medical silicone manufacturer who helped us formulate a much safer, softer and more colourful version of the original, smelly prototype. To this day, the first pair moulded have never fallen out, no matter what, not once - and we reckon that's pretty good going considering how often we find ourselves upside down when we should be the right way up. We're a young company trying to find our feet in the world of business, (the jeans and hoodies get some odd looks at meetings), but we reckon if we can do what we do well, offer our product at a reasonable price and look after and listen to our customers we should be alright. The feedback we have received on the product so far has been fantastic and the journey has been loads of fun, we're looking forward to seeing what's in store for the future and hope you join us for the ride...Cheers,Lloyd and Steve :)At the moment we are in the process of building the website and designing packaging, logos and creating videos. As fun and challenging as this is, it all costs money - and we're running out! The companies we have been working with have been great and a some have such faith in the product that they are willing to accept payment further down the line, once we are into production. This has been a massive help and consolidates our opinion that Earcandi is a genuinely good idea. With a relatively small boost from the Indiegogo campaign we'll be able to source the raw materials we need and pay the packaging manufacturer to move us into full scale production.We've been working on Earcandi for almost a year and had initially intended to launch in November 2013. We held back so that we could ensure the prototype formulation worked perfectly and so that we could speak to more factories to ensure they could cope with a potentially huge ramp-up in production. Comfortable that we can deliver this, we’re now launching Earcandi! Below are a couple of the main challenges we will tackle:Choice of Factory: As with any physical item there are a number of challenges to getting it right. We have been part of numerous projects that have made it through development, into the factory production phase, and then into consumer hands. While our experiences have helped prepare us to avoid major pitfalls, we have been very selective in our choice of factory, choosing a partner that we know we can work with and that is perfect for our needs. They are large enough to scale Earcandi, but without being so big that we'll be lost amidst the shop floor, and they have a great development team. We also intend to spend a large amount of time in person at the factory.Quality Control: Good QC is a major focus of ours. The quantity of orders on Indiegogo will help determine how we handle this. If we receive orders for under 1000 units, we will batch test ourselves at Earcandi HQ in Brighton. If we receive over 1000 orders we will carry out all QC in-situ at the factory, with the assistance of dedicated QC personnel.We had an initial campaign on IGG that we wanted to extend as we felt we didn't have enough time to reach our target. Unfortunately the rules of IGG meant we couldn't do this, but as we have had offers of TV and magazine features we felt it was worth relaunching the campaign as these things would mean we would be likely to hit, or even exceed our target.This is about getting the best possible product into your hands ASAP. So please take a look at the rewards and pledge now.Thanks!KARMA CANDI-LEON: You'll get warm fuzzy feelings, free hugs and a huge dose of Earcandi karma. Angels will descend from the heavens and shower you with ambrosia.

<br/>What is Invizbox?</h1>
<p>Invizbox is a small, low power device that helps provide an easy-to-use method of protecting your privacy on the Internet.  You plug Invizbox into your existing router/modem. It creates a new wifi hotspot and you connect any of your devices (laptop, phone, pc, etc) to this hotspot.</p>
<br/>Our goal is to provide an easy-to-use &amp; competitive price point for this device by drawing together off the shelf hardware and customised open source software solutions.<h2>
<br/>Why do you need Invizbox?</h2>
<p>We all have a right to privacy, a right to protect our personal information, data, location and internet behavior.  You may think you have nothing to “hide”, or you aren’t doing anything “wrong” that would require investigation by third parties but neither do we. That doesn’t mean that we have to leave ourselves open to tracking and profiling by people, governments, companies, hackers etc. who we neither know or trust. Invizbox provides an easy solution to give you back control over who &amp; what you choose to disclose your personal information to.</p>
<br/><p>Most people don’t know how to go about protecting their information on the Internet and with Invizbox you don’t need any technical know-how to gain that protection.  </p>

<p>The router will run on a locked down version of OpenWRT with Tor.</p>
<p>OpenWrt is an open source operating system / embedded operating system based on the Linux kernel, and primarily used on devices like this one. </p>
<p>From the Tor project website: </p>
<blockquote>Tor protects you by bouncing your communications around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around the world: it prevents somebody watching your Internet connection from learning what sites you visit, and it prevents the sites you visit from learning your physical location.</blockquote>
<div><br/></div>Our part in this is to properly lock down OpenWRT, add the latest version of Tor, add various routing configurations, add a user interface that allows people to set up various Tor config files automatically and in a user friendly way (e.g. for relays if people decide they would like to contribute to the Tor network). We will then QA this and hand it over to the manufacturer as an image for the router. We will be fundamentally altering the way the device would have normally worked. <br/><p></p>

<h1>Invizbox - Deine Privatsphäre im Internet schützen–leicht gemacht</h1>
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Was ist Invizbox?</h2><h2>
</h2>
<p>Invizbox ist ein kleines Gerät mit einem niedrigen Stromverbrauch das eine einfach zu bedienende Methode zum Schutz deiner Privatsphäre und Daten im Internet bietet.  Invizbox wird einfach am bestehenden Modem/Router angeschlossen, und schafft dann einen neuen WiFi-Hotspot mit dem alle anderen Geräte (Laptop, Telefon, PC, etc.) verbunden werden. Unser Ziel ist es, dieses Gerät einfach zu bedienend und zu einem wettbewerbsfähigen Preis anzubieten; erreicht werden soll dies durch die Zusammenführung von handelsüblicher Hardware und maßgeschneiderten Open Source-Softwarelösungen.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Warum brauchst Du Invizbox?</h2>
<p>
Wir alle haben ein Recht auf eine Privatsphäre, das Recht auf unsere persönlichen Informationen, Daten, Standort und wie wir uns im Internet verhalten. Du denkst vielleicht, du hast nichts zu ""verstecken"", oder du machst nichts ""falsch"" das eine Untersuchung von Dritten erfordern würde, und das denken wir auch. Aber das bedeutet lange nicht, dass wir uns für Tracking und Profilerstellung von Regierungen, Unternehmen, Hackern, Privatpersonen usw. offen lassen wollen, die wir nicht kennen und denen wir nicht vertrauen. Invizbox bietet eine einfache Lösung die dir wieder Kontrolle zurückgibt, damit du entscheiden kannst zu wem und wofür Du deine persönlichen Daten übergeben willst.
<br/>
Die meisten wissen nicht, wie man die eigenen Informationen im Internet schützen kann, und mit Invizbox brauchst du keine technischen Kenntnisse um diesen Schutz zu erlangen.
</p>
<br/>

 UPDATE: 

Now accepting Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin via our external site. All purchases made there will result in us manually contributing towards our goal here while the campaign is running. When the campaign ends, we will accept paypal and cryptocurrencies on the external site.

What is Invizbox?
Invizbox is a small, low power device that helps provide an easy-to-use method of protecting your privacy on the Internet.  You plug Invizbox into your existing router/modem. It creates a new wifi hotspot and you connect any of your devices (laptop, phone, pc, etc) to this hotspot.
Our goal is to provide an easy-to-use & competitive price point for this device by drawing together off the shelf hardware and customised open source software solutions.
Why do you need Invizbox?
We all have a right to privacy, a right to protect our personal information, data, location and internet behavior.  You may think you have nothing to “hide”, or you aren’t doing anything “wrong” that would require investigation by third parties but neither do we. That doesn’t mean that we have to leave ourselves open to tracking and profiling by people, governments, companies, hackers etc. who we neither know or trust. Invizbox provides an easy solution to give you back control over who & what you choose to disclose your personal information to.
Most people don’t know how to go about protecting their information on the Internet and with Invizbox you don’t need any technical know-how to gain that protection.  

Where are we right now?
Referral Rewards Program
Who are we?
What we need to get off the ground
So, What's the hardware?
And the software?
I'm worried after being burned by a similar project
How are you achieving your low price compared to other products?
Purchasing and shipping


Where are we right now?
We have already established a manufacturing and logistics supply chain to cope with demand.We have added Tor to the OpenWRT software on Invizbox and have also routed traffic through the Tor network. We're currently locking everything down and making sure the firewall rules are solid and there's nothing unnecessary running on the box. We will then move on to developing and enhancing the consumer ready, plug and play experience. Our goal here will be to make this effortless to you the end user and let you get on with normal browsing with significantly enhanced privacy.We have engineering samples in our hands and are amazed at just how small they are. They're tiny!

Referral Rewards Program
Invizbox for FREE? That's right you read that correctly. We want to reward our backers with either cash (paid through paypal) and / or free Invizboxes. How it works is really easy: Share your unique Indiegogo referral URL anywhere and everywhere (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn etc.) and let people know about Invizbox, how great it is and why your friends should buy one. For every $200 that gets pledged with your unique URL, we will give you $10 (that's only 5 unit pledges). If you reach the lofty heights of $1000 of referrals you will get an Invizbox for FREE and $30 via paypal. You get paid for doing what friends do best: being social! it could not get better than that. Find out more about how to share your referral URL and get more referral information here.





Who are we?A 3 person team of computer science professionals with  wide and varied backgrounds which include software development, mobile internet security, lots of Linux experience and security specific qualifications. What we need to get off the ground:Because of our lower profit margins we hope to do a minimum run of 500 units and require 20,000 dollars for this.
So, What's the hardware?
WT 3020A device 
Dimensions: 65mm X 45mm X 22mm

Supports Wifi b/g/n
MAC address filtering
Support for WPA / WPA2, WPA-PSK / WPA2-PSK.
Support System: Windows / Mac / Linux
Colours - White.
Power via micro USB (cable included).
16MB flash
64MB RAM

(note that we investigating using a slightly faster device, but you should assume that it's the one listed above for now)
And the software?
The router will run on a locked down version of OpenWRT with Tor.
OpenWrt is an open source operating system / embedded operating system based on the Linux kernel, and primarily used on devices like this one. 
From the Tor project website: 
Tor protects you by bouncing your communications around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around the world: it prevents somebody watching your Internet connection from learning what sites you visit, and it prevents the sites you visit from learning your physical location.
Our part in this is to properly lock down OpenWRT, add the latest version of Tor, add various routing configurations, add a user interface that allows people to set up various Tor config files automatically and in a user friendly way (e.g. for relays if people decide they would like to contribute to the Tor network). We will then QA this and hand it over to the manufacturer as an image for the router. We will be fundamentally altering the way the device would have normally worked. 


I'm worried after being burned by a similar project:
Two of the project founders have security specific qualifications and all of us have many years of software industry experience and extensive Linux knowledge.
We will provide documentation clearly outlining what the box is good for and especially what it's not good for. Do not trust your freedom or your life to this technology! It's not designed for that.
The OpenWRT image will be properly locked down. No unnecessary daemons will be running on the box.
To cover the possibility of intercepted units with rootkits, we will offer the ability to download and flash firmware directly from our site (with hash for verification). We're looking into tamper evident packaging but can't guarantee it.
On the issue of hardware back doors: We're not manufacturing directly. We have been assured that there are no back doors and we will test for them, but as before you should not trust your life to this box and we will provide clear documentation covering that (and guidelines on what to consider if you need that actual anonymity).
We can't stop browser fingerprinting. We are considering options to help here but for now we'll inform people on ways to avoid it if it's a concern. We're open to suggestion (see link below in the last bullet).
If there are vulnerabilities found in Tor, we will patch our firmware and release an update.
We have guaranteed logistics and hardware manufacturing capabilities for (within reason) any scale, but priority goes to the first 500 customers.
Want to make your own with our firmware? No problem. We'll release full specs on the hardware so you can buy it.
If you have questions, there's a thread over here on boards.ie.

How are you achieving your low price compared to other products?
Low profit margins.

Purchasing and shipping:
Where do you ship to?
Anywhere. Shipping is included in the purchase price.
(NOTE: Purchasers are responsible for any VAT or customs duties levied by their own countries).Thanks to Nina Szymanska for the amazing photography, Ray Woods for the lovely animation and Karl Vincent for the catchy music.Other languages sections are below here.



Invizbox - Deine Privatsphäre im Internet schützen–leicht gemacht


Was ist Invizbox?

Invizbox ist ein kleines Gerät mit einem niedrigen Stromverbrauch das eine einfach zu bedienende Methode zum Schutz deiner Privatsphäre und Daten im Internet bietet.  Invizbox wird einfach am bestehenden Modem/Router angeschlossen, und schafft dann einen neuen WiFi-Hotspot mit dem alle anderen Geräte (Laptop, Telefon, PC, etc.) verbunden werden. Unser Ziel ist es, dieses Gerät einfach zu bedienend und zu einem wettbewerbsfähigen Preis anzubieten; erreicht werden soll dies durch die Zusammenführung von handelsüblicher Hardware und maßgeschneiderten Open Source-Softwarelösungen.

Warum brauchst Du Invizbox?

Wir alle haben ein Recht auf eine Privatsphäre, das Recht auf unsere persönlichen Informationen, Daten, Standort und wie wir uns im Internet verhalten. Du denkst vielleicht, du hast nichts zu ""verstecken"", oder du machst nichts ""falsch"" das eine Untersuchung von Dritten erfordern würde, und das denken wir auch. Aber das bedeutet lange nicht, dass wir uns für Tracking und Profilerstellung von Regierungen, Unternehmen, Hackern, Privatpersonen usw. offen lassen wollen, die wir nicht kennen und denen wir nicht vertrauen. Invizbox bietet eine einfache Lösung die dir wieder Kontrolle zurückgibt, damit du entscheiden kannst zu wem und wofür Du deine persönlichen Daten übergeben willst.

Die meisten wissen nicht, wie man die eigenen Informationen im Internet schützen kann, und mit Invizbox brauchst du keine technischen Kenntnisse um diesen Schutz zu erlangen.


Rewardsprogramm für Empfehlungen

Invizbox GRATIS? Du hast richtig gelesen. Wir wollen unsere Unterstützer entweder mit Bargeld (über Paypal bezahlt) und/oder Invizboxes belohnen.

<h2> </h2>
<h2>Tired of loosing your Phone or anything else? Connect Yodla once with your bluetooth-phone and attach it to what ever you love to loose ;-)</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>YODLA is a key ring which connects with your cell phone via Bluetooth. Set-up once and it is ready for use. Instantly locate your phone, keys or anything else you don't want to lose anymore.</p>
<p>GERMAN:<br/><em>YODLA ist ein Schlüsselanhänger, des sich mit deinem Mobiltelefon via Bluetooth verbindet. Einmal einstellen und Du bist bereit für die Verwendung. Finde Dein Telefon, Deine Schlüssel oder sonstige Gegenstände.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Never lose your important stuff again!</strong> <br/> Where’s my key, where’s my phone? Imagine not knowing where your main items are but you need them immediately.</p>

<p><strong>Find your phone</strong><br/> YODLA can make your cell phone ring. To find your phone, just click the YODLA button.</p>
<p><strong>Find your keys (or anything else)</strong><br/> Use YODLA to attach it with your most frequently needed items like keys. To find your keys, trigger YODLA with your phone.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
<p>YODLA connects with your cell phone via Bluetooth. Pair the devices and setup your custom priority number - the one you want to trigger for an instant call. Use it as a key ring for your keys.</p>
<p>You are ready to use YODLA.</p>
<p><strong>YODLA data</strong></p>
<ul>

<li>Bluetooth 2.1+ EDR and 4.0 (Low Energy)</li>

<li>Bluetooth compatible cell phone</li>
</ul><p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Open Development for YODLA</strong><br/> We want to share all development work with all of you and enable you to collaborate with us on this project.</p>
<p>This why we develop the device on an open collaboration platform for you to participate and help in realizing the project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why we need your help?</strong></p>
<p>We have completed the functional prototypes of YOLDA to verify that it works.</p>
<p>We want to produce a small volume of a few hundred YODLAs. We are looking at a retail price below 28 Euro.</p>
<p><strong>Future Plans</strong></p>
<p>Trigger Apps (iPhone, Androit) with the push of a button to bring more life to YODLA.</p>
<p><strong>Why the YODLA campaign?<br/></strong>We are a hand full of close friends, who are working on innovation and improvements for the world and the people. We are from Austria, where yodeling is used as method to communicate in the mountains, this inspired us for YODLA. Some of us are geeks, some of us are project managers and some of us are extremely creative spirits. However, we all have one thing in common: Technology.</p>
<p>When people ask us how we got the idea for YODLA, we can actually tell them that we didn't—it found us. We got the notification of an idea competition (GruenderGarage – see partners) and one of our team entered an idea whilst kissed by a muse. A few weeks later, he was notified that this was an idea with potential and the go ahead to post it on indiegogo.com for crowd funding.</p>
<p>Initially we have looked at YODLA for quickly triggering actions with a smartphone, like ordering your favorite pizza, activating equipment such as heating systems through apps, and so on. We were talking to a great deal of people about this device, but they did not seem to have a hunger for it.<br/> However, when we were talking to a young group of blind and visually impaired people in a Call Center in our area, we received a totally different feedback. When mentioning, that with a push of a button, your phone can be located as it rings, they responded with a wave of positive feedback. The same with our parents and their friends - they see the need for YODLA, because of misplacing phone or keys very, very frequently.</p>
<p>We would love to give YODLA to everyone!!!</p>

Open Development for YODLA We want to share all development work with all of you and enable you to collaborate with us on this project.
This why we develop the device on an open collaboration platform for you to participate and help in realizing the project.
 
Why we need your help?
We have completed the functional prototypes of YOLDA to verify that it works.
We want to produce a small volume of a few hundred YODLAs. We are looking at a retail price below 28 Euro.
Future Plans
Trigger Apps (iPhone, Androit) with the push of a button to bring more life to YODLA.
Why the YODLA campaign?We are a hand full of close friends, who are working on innovation and improvements for the world and the people. We are from Austria, where yodeling is used as method to communicate in the mountains, this inspired us for YODLA. Some of us are geeks, some of us are project managers and some of us are extremely creative spirits. However, we all have one thing in common: Technology.
When people ask us how we got the idea for YODLA, we can actually tell them that we didn't—it found us. We got the notification of an idea competition (GruenderGarage – see partners) and one of our team entered an idea whilst kissed by a muse. A few weeks later, he was notified that this was an idea with potential and the go ahead to post it on indiegogo.com for crowd funding.
Initially we have looked at YODLA for quickly triggering actions with a smartphone, like ordering your favorite pizza, activating equipment such as heating systems through apps, and so on. We were talking to a great deal of people about this device, but they did not seem to have a hunger for it. However, when we were talking to a young group of blind and visually impaired people in a Call Center in our area, we received a totally different feedback. When mentioning, that with a push of a button, your phone can be located as it rings, they responded with a wave of positive feedback. The same with our parents and their friends - they see the need for YODLA, because of misplacing phone or keys very, very frequently.
We would love to give YODLA to everyone!!!

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>We are high school students participating in a Junior Achievement Company Program. It all started with an idea and a drawing. We had an idea about creating something to make holding a cell phone easier. That idea evolved into a magnetic cell phone holder. With an interest in helping a good cause, one of our classmates made a drawing of a turtle holding a cell phone. Excited, we knew we were on to something and the SnapTurtle was born. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Challenge</h3>
<p>Our biggest challenge has been production. We make our SnapTurtles on a 3D printer. 3D printing a SnapTurtle takes almost two hours and we only have two 3D printers at school which we need to share with other classes.</p>
<h3>Our Need</h3>
<p>A faster way to print our SnapTurtles is what we need. You can help by funding SnapTurtle so that we can hire a 3D printing company to do the printing for us.</p>
<p>With an investment of $25, you will fund our first round of SnapTurtle production and we will send you a SnapTurtle.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You will not only receive a SnapTurtle with your investment, but a portion of our profits will be donated to the <a href=""https://seaturtles.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Turtle Island Restoration Network</a> in Galveston, Texas.</p>

TinySticky: the story 
TinySticky is a super sticky, double sided sticky pad made of high quality, non-toxic rubber.

And because of TinySticky’s transferable, no-residue nature you can use the TinySticky on almost any surface* and with a variety of objects including cell phones, coins, pencils, pens or even kitchen utensils! Use it to organize your car, office, bathroom or kitchen.

TinySticky is guaranteed to work for a year regardless of dust, heat, cold or humidity!





TinySticky’s special rubber is self-refreshing: when the pad becomes less sticky, washing it and letting it dry is enough to bring it back to its original state of super stickiness.

Today, as technological progress allows you to track your activities until each step, the most important issue is to protect the integrity of personal data, and to ensure their inaccessibility by third persons.The concept of our cover allows you to block access to any data stored in the memory of your device, to hide information about the current location and remove your device from the zone of ray reachability of signals of any type, just by closing the zipper case.

Features of the The Invisible Case:

- High level of digital protection from ray signals of any type, including Wi-Fi, GPS, and others.
- Availability of interaction with any possible devices (smartphones / tablets).
- Comfortable dimensional grid, which provides support for any carrier.
- High quality of the raw materials.
- Exclusive design. Handmade.
- Toughness, solidity, wear resistance.








Why do you need our product?The rhythm of modern life often obliges us to be online 24/7, using two or more devices for connection. The Invisible allows to neutralize them, just by closing the zipper of the case. Never before that the full offline feeling was so easy to achieve. 

MaterialsLeather.
The outer layer is made of a high-grade quality nappa – fine semi-aniline leather produced from the cattle hides and lambskin. This material is practical, and has a high abrasion resistance. 
Invisible-effect
The inner part is a layer of special innovative covering, which exercise the full isolation of ray signals of any type. We call it a brand «Invisible-effect».


SizesEspecially for our users, we have tried to create a practical and actual range of sizes, providing support for all modern smartphones and tablets. The concept of our case study involves the design in the context of four different sizes: A, A +, B +, B.



The IdeaThe idea of the Invisible Case belongs to our designer. The concept of the cover that hides all the functions of your phone and takes it into a complete isolation, comes from the eternal dissatisfaction with the total availability of the personal data. ""Personal data should be protected '- she said once, explaining her idea during one of the informal meetings. The Invisible immediately made a strong impression on all project team members.


At the moment, a team of three people is working on the briefcase for five months. Almost a half-year marathon of developing of our products contained a long process of accumulation of ideas, prototype development, conducting tests, design, test operation and others. The final version, tested in professional laboratories showed excellent technical results, and the appearance of the case has received numerous compliments during the focus. That's why the The Invisible team is confident in its success.


Now the concept The Invisible has adopted its final appearance. Spy case conceived by us effectively works in any medium and with any modern device, demonstrating the tremendous level of isolation. We are satisfied with our work and we dream to share our development with the whole world. We need your help so that Invisible could be implemented and enter in mass production stage.

SMARTwheel™  Overview
Control Your Car
and Your Smart Devices With Simple Gestures—Without Taking Your Hands off the
Wheel
SMARTwheel is the first intelligent steering wheel cover,
which lets you control everything in your car, plus your phone and other smart
devices, using simple gestures like taps and swipes, right on your steering
wheel. No more reaching for buttons, fiddling with knobs, or messing around
with remote touchscreens. Plus, SMARTwheel gives you real-time feedback and
insights delivered wirelessly to our smartphone app, to actually make you a
better driver.Snap it on any steering wheel--in seconds!
Get connected with
our smartphone app, a simple tool to monitor your vehicle, track your driving
habits, and more.
SMARTwheel connects wirelessly with a companion smartphone
app, which lets you see trip data, tap into your car’s computer via the
optional OBD-port plugin, and get insights into your driving habits.


The SMARTwheel app
lets you track:

· 
Turn rate
· 
Hand position
· 
Gesture history
· 
Tampering
· 
Drowsy driving events
· 
Unsafe driving events
· 
Trip length and time
·

Technology
Bringing Touchpad
Controls to your Steering Wheel
Inside every SMARTwheel is advanced sensor technology that works with a proprietary algorithm to interpret the most
subtle hand movements, effectively turning your steering wheel into an
intelligent touchpad. SMARTwheel is programmed to track your individual driving
habits, so it knows how you drive—and it uses simple, distinct gestures to let
you control your vehicle and your smart devices.
Harnessing the
Power of Gesture Recognition
Gesture recognition is a rapidly developing field with
applications in computing, AI, gaming, and more, in which people use movement
to control or interact with their devices. We wanted to bring this technology
into our cars, to make driving more fun, intuitive, and safe. 
We set out to develop a combination of advanced sensor technology and a proprietary algorithm to allow us to interpret subtle hand movements
on the steering wheel, turning your steering wheel into a touchpad you can use
to control your vehicle and smart devices!

Control your vehicle1. Adjust your stereo2. Turn headlights on or off3. Activate turn signals4. Turn on windshield wipersControl your smart devices5. Communicate with GPS6. Answer or make a phone call, initiate a voice text, and activate Siri or other voice-controlled virtual assistantAll without taking your hands off the wheel!
Open API
Our open API for iOS and Android means developers
everywhere can dream up new applications for the SMARTwheel Technology.

The Magic is in the
Microprocessor
We used Texas Instruments' MSP430-BT5190 for its
robust microprocessing capabilities needed to run our proprietary algorithm,
which lets SMARTwheel™ analyze complex hand-position data, send real-time
feedback for smarter driving, and coordinate Bluetooth communication.

Safer Driving is At Your
Fingertips
Distracted driving is a growing problem, but SMARTwheel
can help end this dangerous epidemic. 
Unlike devices that record vehicle data or apps that
disable smartphones from use, SMARTwheel is a proactive solution that
eliminates distractions with gesture recognition, and gives real-time alerts to
actually change how people drive. 
· 
STAY SAFE
with gesture recognition. Control your car’s basic functions and your smart
devices without ever taking your hands off the wheel, or your eyes off the
road. 
· 
DRIVE
SMARTER with real-time feedback. Patented sensing technology encourages
safe hand position, and lights and tones alert you to common distracted driving
behaviors. 
· 
TRACK
IMPROVEMENT with our smartphone app. SMARTwheel delivers trip data to your
smartphone via Bluetooth with teachable insights and a grading system to track
progress.

<div>Astraterran ensimmäinen laitos julkaistiin heinäkuussa 2014 kovakantisena kirjana, jossa oli värikuvitus. Pelin saama suosio ylitti omat odotukseni ja 500 kappaleen ensipainos myytiin loppuun alle vuodessa. Vaikka peliä ei ole otettu tämän jälkeen uutta painosta, emme suinkaan ole ole olleet asian suhteen toimettomina.<br/>
</div>
<div>
<p>Astraterraan on julkaistu kaksi lisäosaa: olentolisäosa <i>Otus Mekanikus</i> sekä seikkailukokoelma <i>Mutkia Matkassa</i>. Astraterrasta ollaan myös parhaillaan tekemässä käännöstä englanniksi ja se on osa Suomen Pelimuseon kokoelmaa.</p>
<p>Ensimmäisen painoksen loppumisen jälkeen mielessä on käynyt monia eri vaihtoehtoja ja lopulta parhaaksi vaihtoehdoksi tuli todettua uuden päivitetyn ja laajennetun laitoksen tekeminen.</p>
<p><b>Astraterran 2. Laitos on yhteensopiva ensimmäisen laitoksen kanssa, mutta myös uudistaa peliä monella tapaa</b>. Näkyvin uudistus on kirjan jakaminen kahteen erilliseen kovakantiseen kirjaan: pelaajien Löytöretkeilijän oppaaseen ja pelinjohtajan Kertojan käsikirjaan. Tämän ohella sääntöjä on muun muassa jäsennelty uudelleen ja hahmojen kehitykseen on tuotu lisää vaihtoehtoja. Pelimaailman kuvausta, olentopediaa, lemmikkivalikoimaa ja varustelistaa on myös laajennettu entisestään - muutamia kohtia mainitakseni.</p>

</div></div>","Etsitkö Astraterran 2. laitoksen ennakkomyyntiä? Löydät sen TÄÄLTÄ.Astraterra uudistuu!
Astraterran ensimmäinen laitos julkaistiin heinäkuussa 2014 kovakantisena kirjana, jossa oli värikuvitus. Pelin saama suosio ylitti omat odotukseni ja 500 kappaleen ensipainos myytiin loppuun alle vuodessa. Vaikka peliä ei ole otettu tämän jälkeen uutta painosta, emme suinkaan ole ole olleet asian suhteen toimettomina.


Astraterraan on julkaistu kaksi lisäosaa: olentolisäosa Otus Mekanikus sekä seikkailukokoelma Mutkia Matkassa. Astraterrasta ollaan myös parhaillaan tekemässä käännöstä englanniksi ja se on osa Suomen Pelimuseon kokoelmaa.
Ensimmäisen painoksen loppumisen jälkeen mielessä on käynyt monia eri vaihtoehtoja ja lopulta parhaaksi vaihtoehdoksi tuli todettua uuden päivitetyn ja laajennetun laitoksen tekeminen.
Astraterran 2. Laitos on yhteensopiva ensimmäisen laitoksen kanssa, mutta myös uudistaa peliä monella tapaa. Näkyvin uudistus on kirjan jakaminen kahteen erilliseen kovakantiseen kirjaan: pelaajien Löytöretkeilijän oppaaseen ja pelinjohtajan Kertojan käsikirjaan. Tämän ohella sääntöjä on muun muassa jäsennelty uudelleen ja hahmojen kehitykseen on tuotu lisää vaihtoehtoja. Pelimaailman kuvausta, olentopediaa, lemmikkivalikoimaa ja varustelistaa on myös laajennettu entisestään - muutamia kohtia mainitakseni.

Astraterran 2. laitos on ennakkomyynnissä nyt!

Astraterra on koko perheen seikkailupeli, jossa löytöretket, höyrykoneet , aurinkotuulilla purjehtivat aurinkopurjelaivat sekä taianomaiset teknoaarteet ovat sankareiden arkipäivää.
Astraterran sankarit ovat löytöretkeilijöitä, joiden tehtävänä on tutkia ja uudelleen kartoittaa sirpaleisen maailman unohdettuja kolkkia. Seikkailuillaan sankarit tulevat kohtaamaan mitä omituisempia otuksia, ikimuistoisia henkilöitä ja ihmeellisiä paikkoja. Astraterrassa pelaajat roolipelaavat kukin omaa sankarihahmoaan ja pelaamisen tuloksena syntyy tarina sankarien seikkailuista. 
Peli soveltuu kaiken ikäisille 7-vuotiaasta alkaen, niin aloittelijoille kuin hieman kokeneemmille roolipelikonkareillekin. Astraterra on suunniteltu yhdessä lasten kanssa, joten se on varmasti lapsille sopiva. Vaikka suositusikäraja on 7 vuotta, peli sopii myös pienemmille jättämällä joitain hankalampia asioita pelistä pois.

Jos ikinä saamme kasaan näin suuren potin, meillä on rahoitus valmiina edellämainittujen lisäosien painattamiseen. Kaikki vähintään 25€:llä ennakkoon tilanneet saavat Mutkia matkassa, Olentopedia: Otus Mekanikus ja Höyrysepän verstas -lisäosat printtituotteina muiden tilattujen tuotteiden lisäksi 
HUOM! Lisäosien toimitus ei ehdi kirjan kanssa samaan toimitukseen, mutta tästä ei koidu Sinulle lisäkuluja. Niiden julkaisu- ja toimitusaikataulusta ilmoitamme myöhemmin, kun yksityiskohdat tarkentuvat. 

Kustannusrakenne Meille on tärkeää saada peli julkaistua - ja tietysti mahdollisimman laadukkaana. Sen vuoksi kaikki ennakkomyynnin tuotto kohdistetaan Astraterran sääntökirjan ja sen ohella myytävien oheistuotteiden tuotantokustannoksiin. Kovakantisen kirjan kulut ovat noin 3 500 € ja kovakantisen värillisen kirjan oheistuotteineen noin 7 500 €. Tavoitteenamme ennakkomyynnissä on kattaa painokustannukset ja muut välttämättömät tuotantokulut, jotta voisimme tehdä kirjasta mahdollisimman hienon ja laadukkaan.  Ennakkomyynnillä katettavat tuotantokustannukset 7500€ saakka jakautuu karkeasti näin: 
75% - Painokustannukset (Kirjan painokulut + rahti)
 15% - Oheistuotteet (PJ-näkösuojat, julisteet, nopat, jne.)

7% - Palvelupalkkiot (Indiegogo ja Paypal)
3 % - Muut kulut (logistiikka, muut palvelumaksut, jne)
0 % - Palkkiot tai palkat tekijöille tai kolmansille osapuolille
Tämän ylittävä osuus sijoitetaan lisäosien (mm. Mutkia matkassa, Olentopedia: Otus Mekanikus ja Höyrysepän verstas) tuotantokustannuksiin.   Astraterra – koko perheen seikkailuroolipeliä tekee Ironspine.
Ironspine on suomalainen roolipelikustantaja ja julkaisija, joka on toiminut vuodesta 2006 ja saanut paljon aikaan ollakseen vain parin kaverin harrastus. Tällä kertaa haluamme tehdä seikkailuhenkisen roolipelin koko perheelle. Videolla esiintyy Astraterra-projektin pääsuunnittelija ja tuottaja, Miska Fredman, viiden lapsen isä ja pelialan ammattilainen. Aisaparina pelisuunnittelussa ja kirjoittamisessa toimii Ironspinen toinen kantava voima, Samuli Ahokas. Laatupäälliköinä ja apulaispelisuunnittelijoina ovat toimineet Miskan kolme vanhinta lasta: R. Fredman, M. Fredman ja E. Fredman.   Lahjakkaiden luottokuvittajien kaartiin kuuluuvat mm. Olli Juutilainen, Olli Hietala, Simo Latvanen, Jouni Nummela ja Hans Zenjuga. Heidän kuvituksissaan Astraterran maailma ja sen monenlaiset olennot heräävät henkiin.
Lisäksi projektitiimissä on ollut apuna useita roolipelialan konkareita kommentoimassa peliä, oikolukijoita, sekä innokkaita pelitestaajia.  
 Astraterra on lasten kanssa suunniteltu roolipeli, mutta se sopii myös nuorille ja aikuisille. Se on aloittelijaystävällinen peli, jonka suunnittelussa on huomioitu erityisesti lapset ja nuoret.   Roolipelaaminen on arvokas harrastus, sillä se harjoittaa taitoa käyttää mielikuvitusta ja kertoa tarinoita. Se on sosiaalinen harrastus, jossa ollaan aidosti ja suoraan vuorovaikutuksessa keskenään. Ei peliohjaimien tai langattoman verkon kautta. Astraterra auttaa ylläpitämään näitä kallisarvoisia perinteisiä taitoja ja tarjoaa vaihtoehdon valmiiksi kiillotetulle ja pureskellulle viihteelle.  Haavenamme on, että kahdenkymmenen vuoden päästä Suomessa on sukupolvi nuoria aikuisia, ketkä ovat löytäneet oman luovuutensa ja rohkeuden käyttää mielikuvitustaan roolipeliharrastuksen kautta. Uskomme, että Astraterra voi tehdä sen mahdolliseksi - tai ainakin auttaa siinä. Lisää roolipelaamisesta voit lukea täältä.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The Combimouse is a Combination Keyboard and Mouse that makes computer input easy and very fast.</p>
<p>It is a split keyboard with separate left and right parts to be used by the left and right hands.</p>
<p>The Combimouse has been in development for a number of years.</p>
<p>There is a lot of interest in the product. Our website has been viewed over 200,000 times, a Google search generates over 50,000 results and the pitch video for our first campaign was viewed over 30,000 times. In May this year we finally resolved alll ergonomic issues and expect to go into production soon. There are about 1.6 billion computers in use and so we think the Combimouse will be very popular.</p>
<p>We used funding raised in the first round to complete the right part and we now have a product that works very well.</p>
<p>We will need to raise significant funding for the Manufacturing phase. Before we do that we need to complete the design and have it evaluated by an independent authoritative organisation to confirm that it works as well as we say it does. This will confirm the product viability and will give investors confidence to invest in the manufacturing phase.</p>

<h3>Old Prototype</h3>
<p>The photo below is of an old prototype which is not ergonomic. It illustrates the Combimouse setup which is a split keyboard with two parts. As you have seen above we have made the Pre-Production right part. With funds raised in this round we will make the matching left part which will look similar in shape to the left part in the photo below.</p>

<h3>What is the Combimouse?</h3>
<p>The Combimouse is a combination keyboard and mouse. The right part doubles as a keyboard and mouse. When you grip it, it becomes a mouse and specific keys switch to mouse click buttons.</p>
<p>You don't have to move your hand off the keyboard to operate the mouse. You just drop your hand, grip it and move it making Computer usage more efficient and convenient. This is the main advantage of the Combimouse.</p>
<p>The right part works and feels exactly the same as a regular mouse.</p>
<p>The Combimouse <a href=""http://www.combimouse.com/How%20works.htm"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">website</a> details how it works. </p>
<p>Below are two photos showing the two ways it can be gripped during mouse mode.</p>
<p>The first one is exactly the same way as gripping a normal mouse. It takes fractionally longer to reach then the second method, but it is more accurate because you wrist is supported on the table.</p>
<p>The time to grip using the second grip mode is virtually zero. Pointing is slighly less accurate than the first method because you wrist isn't supported on the table.</p>
<p>When the unit is touched on the right side by the small finger, a sensor is activated and the unit switches to mouse mode. The keyboard keys then become mouse click buttons.</p>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p><strong>Will the Combimouse be available in other keyboard layouts?</strong></p>
<p>See this <a href=""http://combimouse.com/Blog/?p=202"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">blog</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why has it taken so long?</strong></p>
<p>Technology is only now available to make it feasible - including thin wall plastics, plastic mold flow analysis software, light weight notebook keyboard technology, low profile mouse sensors and ultra low power electronics.</p>
<p>Overcoming design problems has taken time. Especially making it light and mobile as a mouse AND immobile as a keyboard and at the same time making it manufacturable. For details please read the blog <a href=""http://combimouse.com/Blog/?p=84"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Combimouse Design Evolution</a>. The solution of making it immobile as a keyboard was only achieved in mid 2013 and has been patented.</p>

<p><strong>If Wichita State University tested it successfully why wait another 10 years?</strong></p>
<p>The prototype used by them was not manufacturable.</p>
<p>It moved around during typing.</p>
<p>As discussed above technology was not available at the time to make a commercial product.</p>
<p><strong>Will the keys be user configurable?</strong></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><strong>Is the Right Unit too heavy as a mouse?</strong></p>
<p>No, it isn't. See <a href=""http://combimouse.com/Blog/?p=84"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">here</a>.</p>
<p>As a comparison the Apple Magic Mouse is 108 grams.</p>
<p>Combimouse Right Unit about 80 grams (this includes 26 grams of lead weights to optimise the centre of gravity and weight distribution).</p>
<p><strong>Does the Right Unit move during typing?</strong></p>

Before we do that we need to complete the design and have it evaluated by an independent authoritative organisation to confirm that it works as well as we say it does. This will confirm the product viability and will give investors confidence in the product.
If Wichita State University tested it successfully why wait another 10 years?
The prototype used by them was not manufacturable.
It moved around during typing.
As discussed above technology was not available at the time to make a commercial product.
Will the keys be user configurable?
Yes
Is the Right Unit too heavy as a mouse?
No, it isn't. See here.
As a comparison the Apple Magic Mouse is 108 grams.
Combimouse Right Unit about 80 grams (this includes 26 grams of lead weights to optimise the centre of gravity and weight distribution).
Does the Right Unit move during typing?
No, it doesn't. See here.

Our first launch will be for iPhone 6/6s!


plate.O will email order forms for color combinations before the campaign is over to all gift recipients!
After the campaign, cases will be shipped ASAP!


   How it works
The plate.O is a two part bumper iPhone case. First, you place your iPhone into the back of the bumper where it fits perfectly. Then, you pick the color backplate you want to completely customize your phone. Lastly, you snap on the backplate to complete the case!



Why do we need $15,000?
The Funding will be used for the following:


Shipping and packaging design
Website Improvement
Initial Order
Manufacturing Cost

     The Impact The plate.O is designed to fulfill every phone case need:  The plate.O modularity allows for one case to change with your style, and your needs. Charity backplates where all the profit goes to the represented charity.  We're offering a stylish phone case that does not sacrifice on protection. 
   Slim and Sleek Design  We designed the plate.O to be slim and mirror the aesthetics of the iPhone. The sleek design feels and looks like you are holding an iPhone, but adds protection with the aluminium bumper. 

   Renderings We have worked tirelessly to produce a design that allows for a protective phone case as well as a aesthetically pleasing design.

Be the first to know when it is avaliable to order again by subscribing to our newsletter!Unsatisfied with most devices out there our team decided to surprise the market by changing the way products are developed. In our open online community, under codename: Project Pyramid Flipper, more than 1000 hardware enthusiasts collaborated globally and created the Eve V.  'Intel is supporting this  Eve-Tech project because we see the potential for success for the crowd-development approach they are taking. Intel is excited to see such a well-designed premium device, based on Intel 7th Gen Core Processors, coming to market soon.’ – WK Tan, Corporate Vice President, Intel Corporation.Fascinated by the idea of crowd development, Microsoft and Intel invested in this project allowing us to create a true flagship device. Both companies have helped by supporting us with their R&D resources and provided us with top-notch device testing and debugging facilities. Microsoft helps us ensure that Windows 10 and it's hero features work flawlessly, while Intel helps us to achieve optimal thermal performance of the V and it's hero features like Thunderbolt 3 with external graphics support, Tekes is a Finnish governmental innovation fund focused on companies with disruptive ideas. The competition was tough but our big idea of crowd development won hearts of the officials allowing us to secure early- and mid-stage funding of our project. Mozo is our accessories partner located few blocks away from us in downtown Helsinki. Together we are developing luxurious accessories for our device such as V Alcantara keyboard.Propeller Design is One of our core partners. This Swedish design agency has delivered numerous award-winning designs to the market.Eve V, accessories as well as other Eve products are compliant with electronics certification standards in the US, Europe, China and other parts of the world.     The remarkable interval between charges is achieved with a high capacity battery, totalling 48 lithium-ion powered watt hours. This is even further enhanced by purpose-built algorithms, modernizing the power management.  Delivering up to 3.6 GHz frequencies, The V's 7th generation Intel (R) Core (tm) CPUs are fabricated with 14 nm technology.  Speeding up your computing experience, the processors are 100% silent and run without fan noise or bulky cooling.  We started by choosing one of the best LCD panels in the world. Each of this stunning display's nearly five Million pixels is turbo-charged by a new atomic arrangement. The Indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO)-backlight composition enhances each pixel by raising the amount of light transmission.  Color accuracy is guaranteed with factory calibration.  The display unit is perfected by optically bonding it to a sheet of scratch resistant Corning Gorilla Glass that has a special layer of anti-reflective and dirt-repelling coating applied on top of it.Equipped with dazzling brightness and saturated colors , the world looks better on our display.  We went to extreme lengths to ensure the V would be comfortable and convenient to use, yet stand its own as an iconic, timeless design. The origins of the V's case lie in one of the many bauxite mines of the world. The raw material is eventually refined to aluminium. The aluminum blocks enter facilities, where, with a precise and delicate method, the computer controlled drills actualize the vision of the designers. The finished structure is sandblasted for a silky-smooth surface and anodized for durable and appealing color. The final result is a casing of the highest quality. Light and strong, Eve V's body is only 0.89 cm thick.  It took a tremendous effort to fit everything you need inside. We know you will enjoy the result! Our goal was to create a beautiful device that you can use anywhere, anytime. Embodying both the extremely thin casing and one of the slimmest LCD panels ever created, the Eve V weighs in at less than a kilogram with its keyboard, making it lighter and thinner than any laptop. We wanted our users to enjoy a precise, noiseless and ergonomic method of input, so we set out to design a durable and sturdy, premium build. Under the fabric surface, precision enhancing scissor mechanisms were built beneath each key. Unmatched in precision, a state-of-the-art mouse pad was chosen. We improved the touch interface even further by a lamination the surface with low friction glass material. Should you choose to go wireless, each input is carried securely over Bluetooth(R) 4.2 radio frequencies. Accompanied with with the modern day cloud services such as OneNote®, the V's pressure sensitive electronic pencil will supercharge your creativity.Windows Ink certified, the V is future-proofed by being compatible with most styluses out there.So you wouldn't ever loose your notes anymore. Imagine logging in to email, bank or to social media - effortlessly.V Computer's power button has a fingerprint reader hidden underneath.Its blazing fast, typing your password in 0.1 seconds"". More and more websites are moving to accept Windows Hello as the preferred log in method. With Windows Hello, V allows you to securely log in with a single touch. Your biometric data is stored in the device, fully encrypted and never uploaded to third parties or online. So its time to forget forgetting passwords. Where the display matches the taste of your eyes, the audio quality of V Computer  will not leave your ears disappointed. The V is equipped with one of the finest audio processor available.  Each sound comes out loud and clear through the quad speakers.  The V also features a dedicated audio amplifier on the headphone jack.HYPERLINK TO COMMUNITY: See why community chose this specV Computer remains true to speed even when it comes to its connectivity. WirelessThe blazing fast MU-MIMO AC wireless card streams up to 867 Mbps and with its dual antenna-dual-channel capability, It also achieves greater signal strength and coverage. We've also included the new Bluetooth 4.2, that delivers up to ten times faster connections than other devices in the category, while also providing better reliability and signal strength.  Thunderbolt 3With Thunderbolt 3's top speed of 40 gigabytes each second, your files MOVE.

<p>Have you ever wanted to be in two places at once, or keep an eye on something while you're away? Maybe you want to check on your kids or a grandparent? Has the dog been in the trash again?  </p>
<p><strong>We believe home security and monitoring should be affordable for everyone.</strong> That's why we built an amazing app called <em>Presence</em>, which repurposes your old iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch as a Wi-Fi video camera. Presence sends short motion detection clips right to your smartphone when something happens, and gives you face-to-face audio and video so you can talk back to your pets and relatives while you're on-the-go. <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/presence-by-people-power/id618598211?ls=1&amp;mt=8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">See for yourself, download it for free</a>. </p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://peoplepowerco.com/img/indiegogo/hand.png"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>Now we'd like to take Presence even further by using smartphones to create smarthomes. Our users have asked for longer, more frequent and higher quality video clips stored in the cloud, and browser support so that you only need to have one spare device for the camera, or if you have more than one, you can view them at the same time. </p>
<p>When we combine Presence with awesome Internet-connected hardware and even more features, you not only have peace-of-mind by monitoring your home or small business, you can control it.

<p><strong>For the ultimate do-it-yourself security and monitoring. </strong>Presence Pro is a service that will take your home or small business security to the next level of peace-of-mind. Today, the free Presence app only sends you a very short video clip when motion is detected from your free Wi-Fi video camera. It's a great start, but it isn't enough. The Presence Pro service lets you record longer, more frequent, and higher quality video clips when motion is detected back at home. Video is backed up in the cloud with bank-level security so even if something bad happens, you have all the encrypted video footage stored safely off site. You'll be able to save and review past video footage and share the best ones with your friends. Presence Pro will also include web browser support so you can view multiple cameras simultaneously from your laptop while you're at work.</p>

Maybe you want to check on your kids or a grandparent? Has the dog been in the trash again?  
We believe home security and monitoring should be affordable for everyone. That's why we built an amazing app called Presence, which repurposes your old iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch as a Wi-Fi video camera. Presence sends short motion detection clips right to your smartphone when something happens, and gives you face-to-face audio and video so you can talk back to your pets and relatives while you're on-the-go. See for yourself, download it for free. 

Now we'd like to take Presence even further by using smartphones to create smarthomes. Our users have asked for longer, more frequent and higher quality video clips stored in the cloud, and browser support so that you only need to have one spare device for the camera, or if you have more than one, you can view them at the same time.

<h3>The Problem we solve</h3>
<p>Ever got a high telephone bills and wondered why you have to pay a fortune when calling overseas or when you are travelling?</p>
<p>For years operators have been overcharging for SMS, international calling, long distance calling, roaming and other services.</p>
<h3>How we solve it</h3>
<p>The rise of smartphones and availability of mobile data (WiFi / 3G / 4G) have made it possible for Yeloworld to develop a smart mobile App that will do to mobile calling what WhatsApp did to SMS.</p>
<p>Yeloworld has rates over 90% cheaper compared to leading operators and other providers in over 200 countries and allows users to save up on their international calls and stop wasting money on their phone bill.</p>
<h3>Who we are?</h3>
<p>The two co-founders behind this Indiegogo campaign are technology entrepreneurs Philippe Joly and Ron van Valkengoed. Ron is Dutch, so “cheap” is part of his Dutch DNA and Philippe is French. When you put a 'grumpy"" Frenchman annoyed of being ripped off by mobile operators overcharging and a cost conscious Dutch man together, you get a great cheap calling App, Yeloworld.</p>
<p>While very experienced and serious about business, we don't take ourselves too seriously, which makes Yeloworld a very enjoyable adventure and place to work at.</p>

<p>You can help us in three easy steps: </p>
<p>Step 1: Test the Yeloworld App, it is Free to download (see below) <br/>Step 2: Contribute and get the perks<br/>Step 3: Spread the Word</p>
<h2><img alt=""Yeloworld"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.yeloworld.com/images/title6.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Yeloworld""/></h2>
<p><strong>Yeloworld</strong> is a startup launched in January 2013 with for objective to end the rip-off that mobile users endure from mobile network operators whenever they make international calls or are travelling abroad and roaming.</p>
<h3>Yeloworld is dedicated to make calls cheaper for everyone and shrink our phone bill.</h3>
<p>In simple words, Yeloworld is an App for iOS (iPhone, iPad, iPod) and Android phones/tablets that allows users to make very cheap phone calls to any mobile or landline numbers, anywhere in the world, and save a lot of money on international calls.</p>
<p>In techy words, it’s an OTT calling service using VoIP (Voice over Internet) to initiate the calls and terminating the calls directly on the carrier networks in over 200 countries.</p>
<p>Yeloworld allows you to call <strong>regular phone numbers</strong>. This means that you don't need anything from the receiving party. No need for them to own a smartphone, install any app whatsoever or even be online! <strong>Yeloworld allows you to call anyone, anywhere, on their “normal” phone</strong> (cellphone or fixed landline), regardless of where they are and what type of phone they have.</p>

<p>Since our launch, we have enjoyed some early success already with about 10,000 users getting our first suite of apps for iOS (iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch) and Android. We have received good reviews and great media coverage.</p>

<p><img alt=""No more shock phone bills with Yeloworld"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.yeloworld.com/images/title1.jpg"" src="""" style=""font-size: 1.17em;"" title=""No more shock phone bills with Yeloworld""/></p>
<p>One Australian woman got a bill for 150,000$ because she was travelling in Europe for a few months. A man in the UK got a bill for over 20,000$ for calling his girlfriend abroad. More examples of extreme roaming charges and astronomical phone bills regularly make the headlines of the newspapers around the world.</p>
<p>But without going to the extreme, <em>how many people have received a phone bill inflated by a few hundred dollars after a trip overseas? </em>A lot of people.</p>
<p>Pretty much everyone we know has, at one point or another, received a shock phone bill after calling overseas or travelling abroad.</p>
<p>But there is no reason whatsoever why making a simple phone call home to tell your family that you have arrived safely into a country on the other side of the globe should cost you a fortune. Wouldn't you agree?</p>
<p>We'll let you in on a little secret...mobile network operators have been cashing in on international calls and roaming charges for decades. They have made billions of dollars by overcharging users everywhere they could. And you know why? Because until recently, there was no alternative for the mobile users to make cheaper calls.</p>
<p>The only alternative to make international calls for cheap was to buy a prepaid calling card, scratching a number at the back, dialing an endless sequence of digits, * and # keys, EVERYTIME you wanted to make a call. These calling cards were (and still are) cheap, but not convenient.</p>
<p>Now that technology is catching up, it makes possible for services like Yeloworld to exist and finally allow mobile users to call worldwide for cheap and conveniently, right from their phone, in just one tap.</p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.5em;""> <img alt=""Yeloworld"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.yeloworld.com/images/slider_raw2.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Yeloworld - Cheap Calls Worldwide""/></strong></p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.5em;""> </strong></p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">Did you know...that you can make calls from overseas without even touching your phone bill at all?</strong></p>
<p>When you’re calling using the Yeloworld App, the cost of the calls is taken from your Yeloworld credits, not your phone bill, so you stay in control of what you spend.</p>
<p>This means no more shock bills. In fact, if you connect to a WiFi hotspot (in a hotel or coffee shop somewhere) and you make calls using the Yeloworld App, you are not even touching your phone bill (at all). </p>

<h2><strong>Did you know...that you could make phone calls even if you don't have phone coverage?</strong></h2>
<p>With the Yeloworld App you can connect to a WiFi hotspot and make normal phone calls to mobile numbers or landlines. This means that if you have poor phone coverage or no phone coverage at all (for example the basement, my kitchen :) or a meeting room in the office), as long as you have a WiFi access you can make phone calls normally.</p>

<p>I am Philippe Joly, and with two of my friends, Ron and Egidio, we have co-founded Yeloworld. The three of us have been involved with mobile and Internet technologies for most of our careers and have extended experience in running startup companies, managing projects and leading people.</p>
<p>One day, we realized how much it was costing us to communicate with each other across the globe between Italy, France, the Netherlands, the UK, and Hong Kong (where I now live), so we decided to tackle the issue and we came up with an efficient, low-cost and interesting way to make cheap calls worldwide. We worked like mad scientists, brainstorming the technologies available and we got it...the Yeloworld idea was born.</p>
<p>We then involved more people to help us, developers, analysts, support guys and now have a tight group of people fully dedicated to making Yeloworld a success.</p>
<p>Yeloworld is an ambitious project that aims at changing the way people communicate, allowing them to make cheaper international calls to regular mobile or landline numbers, and offering them the immediate benefit of huge cost savings on their phone bills.</p>
<p>Looking at our competitors, which include large services such as SkypeOut, Google Voice, and Rebtel, which turnover hundreds of millions of dollars, we initially thought that we may have engaged in a Samson vs. Goliath battle.</p>
<p>But we are true entrepreneurs, so we live by the motto <strong>""if nothing is ventured, nothing is gained""</strong>. We decided to go for it and dedicated all our time and resources into creating Yeloworld.</p>
<p>We have put in our own money, built a strong business model, created the website<a href=""http://www.yeloworld.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Yeloworld - Cheap Calls Worldwide""> http://www.yeloworld.com</a>, designed the Apps and launched the Yeloworld service on all the major app stores in the middle of January 2013.</p>
<p>The early results show that we were right to go for it. Our Apps and website are already very popular and growing fast, which is a satisfaction that we can compete, and compete well, even against such big established players.</p>
<p>Our main advantage is that we are able to offer mobile users much cheaper rates than our competitors. in fact, we are offering rates <strong>up to 5 times cheaper</strong> than SkypeOut on many destinations.</p>
<h3><img alt=""Yeloworld"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.yeloworld.com/images/title10.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Yeloworld - Cheap Calls Worldwide""/></h3>
<p>Because we are experts in the mobile field, we understand the complex infrastructures that are behind what seems as simple as a phone call.</p>
<p>We broke the process down into its main components, and then cut great wholesale deals all the way, which allows us to now offer extremely low rates in over 200 countries. We have developed our Apps using the best of VoIP and other voice technologies in order to give a great quality of calls (often better quality of calls than we I call overseas directly) and ensure that Yeloworld users would be able to call any phone numbers, not just smartphones or other users of the same App (like Viber for example or Whatsapp for messaging).</p>
<p>These are great advantages of Yeloworld, as not only can you call for dirt cheap, have good quality calls, but you also don't need to worry about what type of phone or what app the recipient of your call has on his phone, it doesn't matter at all when you call with the Yeloworld App, because you call normal numbers.</p>
<p>While many providers offer calls to landline very cheap, calling mobile numbers remains a relatively unchallenged area. With Yeloworld, we are challenging the established players and offer significantly lower rates to mobile phones.</p>
<p>See for yourself some of our rates compared to SkypeOut, Google Voice and Rebtel:</p>

<p><strong>Yeloworld for iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and Android is our first set of Apps, but we plan to rollout more apps to more platforms (BlackBerry, Windows Mobile and even Web Apps) and more features (SMS and more).</strong></p>
<p>Yeloworld has the potential to help millions of smartphone users around the world save billions of dollars on their phone bills and make a significant impact in the way people communicate in a modern, digitally borderless world. </p>

<h2><img alt=""Yeloworld cheap calls worldwide"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.yeloworld.com/images/title5.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Yeloworld cheap calls worldwide""/></h2>
<p>We’ve made great progress on our own. The Yeloworld App is live on all popular app stores, we have a cool website that attracts thousands of visitors each month, some good press in renowned media, around 3000 Twitter followers, and 1000+ Likes on our Facebook page, but we need your help now.</p>
<p>Our team needs funding to take Yeloworld to the next step and help 1 million people reduce their phone bill this year.</p>
<p>Imagining that Yeloworld could significantly reduce the bills of 1 million people is pretty meaningful and real, and most of all it is immediate. As soon as people start using our App, their bill shrinks straight away.</p>
<p>Because I live abroad, and like most expats in a similar situation, I do need (or simply want) to call my family back home, or my friends spread across the world. I used to pay more than 100US$ per month on my phone calls.</p>
<p>The first month I started using our Yeloworld App, my bill shrinked to 40US$. That’s 60 US$ saved per month so I’ll save over 700 US$ this year. I don’t know about you, but I will be happy at Christmas to have an extra 700 US$ to spend on something more meaningful than a phone bill.</p>
<p>At the current rate and limited funding (our own money), we’ll attract 100,000 users at best by the end of this year, but this is not enough momentum for the business to survive until then. We need to invest in customer aquisition, in developing a version of our App for BlackBerry and Windows Mobile, in extending our distribution, promoting our apps, and last but not least in growing our team.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">Money is not everything but we all know how much it helps</span></strong></p>
<p>We have already invested our own funds in the business and continue to do so, while we work without remuneration. Some of us still have to keep their day jobs, and some of us are working full time (for free) on turning our vision for low-cost communication into reality. But the other reality (less enjoyable) is that we don’t have any more money left to continue without external investment.</p>
<p>We evaluated our options and here they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Bin</strong>: Throw in the bin all the effort done to date, close the shop and go find another job. <em>Not an option!</em>
</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<strong>Financial institutions</strong>: Go to banks or other financial institutions to get a formal insititutional investment. After speaking to Venture Capitalist and other Angel investors, we realized that this approach would not achieve our immediate need because of the lengthy process (6-9 months) and portion of our business that we’ll see disappear. <em>An option but for later!</em>
</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<strong>Indiegogo and crowd funding</strong>: In the end, our Yeloworld vision is a project by the people for the people, so we decided to calculate how much funds we would need to create enough momentum in order to have a self-funding business that would allow us to achieve our goal of helping 1 million people reduce their phone bill this year. The result is that we need 100,000 users by the end of June and we need 34,000 US$ to achieve that result. </li>
</ul><p>So we are asking Indiegogoers to raise a total of $34,000. This will allow us to survive for another 3 months, which is enough time for our team to reach the goal of 100,000 users by the end of June, which will be a tipping point to create the momentum of daily downloads necessary to reach our goal of 1 million users by the end of the year. We'll also finish and launch our next suite of Apps to offer the Yeloworld low rates to more smartphone platforms.</p>
<p>Here is the breakdown of how we will spend the money:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bulk will go into customer aquisition (it cost money to get customers).</li>
<li>Some funds will go towards development. We have an outsourced team of developers and designers ready to get coding.</li>
<li>Developers are great people but they need some business supervision too, so some of the funds will go towards project management. We will allocate the minimum wage salary for one of the founders, to allow him to continue working on Yeloworld full-time.</li>
<li>The rest of the money goes towards running the business during those 3 months, in other words to keep the lights on (utilities, Internet, phone, admin etc…).</li>
</ul><p>And if we get more? We'll simply get there faster, and as a result, instead of hiring 1 person, we may be able to hire 2 or 3, depending on how much we raise.</p>

</div></div>","The Problem we solve
Ever got a high telephone bills and wondered why you have to pay a fortune when calling overseas or when you are travelling?
For years operators have been overcharging for SMS, international calling, long distance calling, roaming and other services.
How we solve it
The rise of smartphones and availability of mobile data (WiFi / 3G / 4G) have made it possible for Yeloworld to develop a smart mobile App that will do to mobile calling what WhatsApp did to SMS.
Yeloworld has rates over 90% cheaper compared to leading operators and other providers in over 200 countries and allows users to save up on their international calls and stop wasting money on their phone bill.
Who we are?
The two co-founders behind this Indiegogo campaign are technology entrepreneurs Philippe Joly and Ron van Valkengoed. Ron is Dutch, so “cheap” is part of his Dutch DNA and Philippe is French. When you put a 'grumpy"" Frenchman annoyed of being ripped off by mobile operators overcharging and a cost conscious Dutch man together, you get a great cheap calling App, Yeloworld.
While very experienced and serious about business, we don't take ourselves too seriously, which makes Yeloworld a very enjoyable adventure and place to work at.

Your help in 3 easy steps
You can help us in three easy steps: 
Step 1: Test the Yeloworld App, it is Free to download (see below) Step 2: Contribute and get the perksStep 3: Spread the Word

Yeloworld is a startup launched in January 2013 with for objective to end the rip-off that mobile users endure from mobile network operators whenever they make international calls or are travelling abroad and roaming.
Yeloworld is dedicated to make calls cheaper for everyone and shrink our phone bill.
In simple words, Yeloworld is an App for iOS (iPhone, iPad, iPod) and Android phones/tablets that allows users to make very cheap phone calls to any mobile or landline numbers, anywhere in the world, and save a lot of money on international calls.
In techy words, it’s an OTT calling service using VoIP (Voice over Internet) to initiate the calls and terminating the calls directly on the carrier networks in over 200 countries.
Yeloworld allows you to call regular phone numbers. This means that you don't need anything from the receiving party. No need for them to own a smartphone, install any app whatsoever or even be online! Yeloworld allows you to call anyone, anywhere, on their “normal” phone (cellphone or fixed landline), regardless of where they are and what type of phone they have.
 


Since our launch, we have enjoyed some early success already with about 10,000 users getting our first suite of apps for iOS (iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch) and Android. We have received good reviews and great media coverage.
- Appolicious/Yahoo - “The New Android App Worth Downloading”
- The Guardian - “30 Android Apps of the Week”
- Appolicious/Yahoo - “Apps Of The Week”
- Telecompaper – “Yelo targets Skype”
- Frenchweb.fr – “A New Low-cost Competitor To Skype”
Frenchweb did a video chronicle featuring yeloworld as part of the new Hong Kong startups founded by French entrepreneurs - click here to watch (in french).
But we’re just scratching the surface, now we need your help to take the next steps. 


One Australian woman got a bill for 150,000$ because she was travelling in Europe for a few months. A man in the UK got a bill for over 20,000$ for calling his girlfriend abroad. More examples of extreme roaming charges and astronomical phone bills regularly make the headlines of the newspapers around the world.
But without going to the extreme, how many people have received a phone bill inflated by a few hundred dollars after a trip overseas? A lot of people.
Pretty much everyone we know has, at one point or another, received a shock phone bill after calling overseas or travelling abroad.
But there is no reason whatsoever why making a simple phone call home to tell your family that you have arrived safely into a country on the other side of the globe should cost you a fortune. Wouldn't you agree?
We'll let you in on a little secret...mobile network operators have been cashing in on international calls and roaming charges for decades. They have made billions of dollars by overcharging users everywhere they could. And you know why? Because until recently, there was no alternative for the mobile users to make cheaper calls.
The only alternative to make international calls for cheap was to buy a prepaid calling card, scratching a number at the back, dialing an endless sequence of digits, * and # keys, EVERYTIME you wanted to make a call. These calling cards were (and still are) cheap, but not convenient.
Now that technology is catching up, it makes possible for services like Yeloworld to exist and finally allow mobile users to call worldwide for cheap and conveniently, right from their phone, in just one tap.
 
 
Did you know...that you can make calls from overseas without even touching your phone bill at all?
When you’re calling using the Yeloworld App, the cost of the calls is taken from your Yeloworld credits, not your phone bill, so you stay in control of what you spend.
This means no more shock bills. In fact, if you connect to a WiFi hotspot (in a hotel or coffee shop somewhere) and you make calls using the Yeloworld App, you are not even touching your phone bill (at all). 
 
Did you know...that you could make phone calls even if you don't have phone coverage?
With the Yeloworld App you can connect to a WiFi hotspot and make normal phone calls to mobile numbers or landlines. This means that if you have poor phone coverage or no phone coverage at all (for example the basement, my kitchen :) or a meeting room in the office), as long as you have a WiFi access you can make phone calls normally.



I am Philippe Joly, and with two of my friends, Ron and Egidio, we have co-founded Yeloworld. The three of us have been involved with mobile and Internet technologies for most of our careers and have extended experience in running startup companies, managing projects and leading people.
One day, we realized how much it was costing us to communicate with each other across the globe between Italy, France, the Netherlands, the UK, and Hong Kong (where I now live), so we decided to tackle the issue and we came up with an efficient, low-cost and interesting way to make cheap calls worldwide. We worked like mad scientists, brainstorming the technologies available and we got it...the Yeloworld idea was born.
We then involved more people to help us, developers, analysts, support guys and now have a tight group of people fully dedicated to making Yeloworld a success.
Yeloworld is an ambitious project that aims at changing the way people communicate, allowing them to make cheaper international calls to regular mobile or landline numbers, and offering them the immediate benefit of huge cost savings on their phone bills.
Looking at our competitors, which include large services such as SkypeOut, Google Voice, and Rebtel, which turnover hundreds of millions of dollars, we initially thought that we may have engaged in a Samson vs. Goliath battle.
But we are true entrepreneurs, so we live by the motto ""if nothing is ventured, nothing is gained"". We decided to go for it and dedicated all our time and resources into creating Yeloworld.
We have put in our own money, built a strong business model, created the website http://www.yeloworld.com, designed the Apps and launched the Yeloworld service on all the major app stores in the middle of January 2013.
The early results show that we were right to go for it. Our Apps and website are already very popular and growing fast, which is a satisfaction that we can compete, and compete well, even against such big established players.
Our main advantage is that we are able to offer mobile users much cheaper rates than our competitors. in fact, we are offering rates up to 5 times cheaper than SkypeOut on many destinations.

Because we are experts in the mobile field, we understand the complex infrastructures that are behind what seems as simple as a phone call.
We broke the process down into its main components, and then cut great wholesale deals all the way, which allows us to now offer extremely low rates in over 200 countries. We have developed our Apps using the best of VoIP and other voice technologies in order to give a great quality of calls (often better quality of calls than we I call overseas directly) and ensure that Yeloworld users would be able to call any phone numbers, not just smartphones or other users of the same App (like Viber for example or Whatsapp for messaging).
These are great advantages of Yeloworld, as not only can you call for dirt cheap, have good quality calls, but you also don't need to worry about what type of phone or what app the recipient of your call has on his phone, it doesn't matter at all when you call with the Yeloworld App, because you call normal numbers.
While many providers offer calls to landline very cheap, calling mobile numbers remains a relatively unchallenged area. With Yeloworld, we are challenging the established players and offer significantly lower rates to mobile phones.
See for yourself some of our rates compared to SkypeOut, Google Voice and Rebtel:
 

 

Yeloworld for iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and Android is our first set of Apps, but we plan to rollout more apps to more platforms (BlackBerry, Windows Mobile and even Web Apps) and more features (SMS and more).
Yeloworld has the potential to help millions of smartphone users around the world save billions of dollars on their phone bills and make a significant impact in the way people communicate in a modern, digitally borderless world. 

 

We’ve made great progress on our own. The Yeloworld App is live on all popular app stores, we have a cool website that attracts thousands of visitors each month, some good press in renowned media, around 3000 Twitter followers, and 1000+ Likes on our Facebook page, but we need your help now.
Our team needs funding to take Yeloworld to the next step and help 1 million people reduce their phone bill this year.
Imagining that Yeloworld could significantly reduce the bills of 1 million people is pretty meaningful and real, and most of all it is immediate. As soon as people start using our App, their bill shrinks straight away.
Because I live abroad, and like most expats in a similar situation, I do need (or simply want) to call my family back home, or my friends spread across the world. I used to pay more than 100US$ per month on my phone calls.
The first month I started using our Yeloworld App, my bill shrinked to 40US$. That’s 60 US$ saved per month so I’ll save over 700 US$ this year. I don’t know about you, but I will be happy at Christmas to have an extra 700 US$ to spend on something more meaningful than a phone bill.
At the current rate and limited funding (our own money), we’ll attract 100,000 users at best by the end of this year, but this is not enough momentum for the business to survive until then. We need to invest in customer aquisition, in developing a version of our App for BlackBerry and Windows Mobile, in extending our distribution, promoting our apps, and last but not least in growing our team.
 
Money is not everything but we all know how much it helps
We have already invested our own funds in the business and continue to do so, while we work without remuneration. Some of us still have to keep their day jobs, and some of us are working full time (for free) on turning our vision for low-cost communication into reality. But the other reality (less enjoyable) is that we don’t have any more money left to continue without external investment.
We evaluated our options and here they are:


Bin: Throw in the bin all the effort done to date, close the shop and go find another job. Not an option!



Financial institutions: Go to banks or other financial institutions to get a formal insititutional investment. After speaking to Venture Capitalist and other Angel investors, we realized that this approach would not achieve our immediate need because of the lengthy process (6-9 months) and portion of our business that we’ll see disappear. An option but for later!



Indiegogo and crowd funding: In the end, our Yeloworld vision is a project by the people for the people, so we decided to calculate how much funds we would need to create enough momentum in order to have a self-funding business that would allow us to achieve our goal of helping 1 million people reduce their phone bill this year. The result is that we need 100,000 users by the end of June and we need 34,000 US$ to achieve that result. 
So we are asking Indiegogoers to raise a total of $34,000. This will allow us to survive for another 3 months, which is enough time for our team to reach the goal of 100,000 users by the end of June, which will be a tipping point to create the momentum of daily downloads necessary to reach our goal of 1 million users by the end of the year. We'll also finish and launch our next suite of Apps to offer the Yeloworld low rates to more smartphone platforms.
Here is the breakdown of how we will spend the money:

The bulk will go into customer aquisition (it cost money to get customers).
Some funds will go towards development. We have an outsourced team of developers and designers ready to get coding.
Developers are great people but they need some business supervision too, so some of the funds will go towards project management. We will allocate the minimum wage salary for one of the founders, to allow him to continue working on Yeloworld full-time.
The rest of the money goes towards running the business during those 3 months, in other words to keep the lights on (utilities, Internet, phone, admin etc…).
And if we get more? We'll simply get there faster, and as a result, instead of hiring 1 person, we may be able to hire 2 or 3, depending on how much we raise.
 


Download the free Yeloworld App for iOS or Android, create your account and use the service (we already give you 50 Eurocent courtesy credit for free so you can make calls straight away to try it)
If you like the service, contribute at the level you can afford, the more the better :) but every contribution helps

 The new BV9600 Plus is different: it has a unique slim, elegant and fashionable design and its thickness had been reduced to only 10mm. It gets the famous tri-proof ruggness of BV phones in a modern, businesslike design.                                             WaterproofDropproofDustproof​

Totally OK Being In Water, Dropped, Beaten and Bashed. For those with a demanding job or lifestyle with constant exposure to environmental hazards, a rugged smartphone with military-grade protection will be the best option.
 
 
        Working Temperature -30 ℃---60℃The ones that work in the bleak and harsh environment will even need a fully rugged, durable and no-compromises phone, especially, active people who regularly practice different types of outdoor sports.     It's freezing out there. You won't need to take your gloves off to use this phone.
If you're sick of taking off your gloves while working, don't have to buy special conductive touch-screen gloves, though. We’ve been used AMOLED touch screen, which integrates the touch sensor into the display well enough to work with gloves. It offers sensitive touch mode that works with gloved hands.




The in-display fingerprint sensors work reasonably well with wet and greasy hands. That’s something you don’t get with capacitive fingerprint sensors.



A fingerprint sensor is both secure and fast, but sometimes you want other unlocking methods. Here's how you can set up and use face unlock to unlock your BV9600 Plus with just a glance.


 


The world of mobile payments has changed significantly over the past decade – and particularly over the past few years as smartphones. The number of in-store mobile payment users in the world is predicted to reach fast and much more.


                                       Advanced GPS offers a valuable outdoor tool for hikers, travelers and other backcountry explorers. And gives you vital information about where you are, where you’ve been and where you want to go.                              Smartphone batteries are getting larger and larger, with the promise of phones that can go all day on a single charge. But grab a fully charged BV9600 plus,  and you won’t need to search for any electrical outlets during the day. The durable phone from Blackview is the longest-lasting phone we’ve tested currently, lasting more than 13 hours gaming on our punishing battery test.         6.21 inch notch AMOLED display much more clear and comfortable to watch video.With AMOLED, so the power consumption during the day is reduced by 20%, and the night time use is reduced by 41% and can also protect your eyes.                                                      The 4G World Connectivity supports all the operators and networks, supports both Sim Cards( or 1 SIM Card & 1 TF Card) on the extremely fast 4G network(3G if you have not upgraded to 4G yet), TF card 128GBUnlock more ways of connecting people while doing outdoor activities, no longer be a barrier to contact your workmate or business partners while travelling between different places and countries

<h3>The Invention of the Rora Ergonomic Case</h3>
<p>My name is Ruhan and I am a South-African who emigrated to Canada 3 years ago. One month after my arrival I was involved in a terrible car accident and incurred several back and shoulder injuries.  My daily job involved putting in many hours hunched over my tablet, exacerbating my back and shoulder pain. After many unsuccessful attempts to find a solution that raised my tablet into a more ergonomic position, I decided to take matters into my own hands. Thus came the idea of the Rora Ergonomic case.</p>
<p>Using a foam board and some old weathered pants, I got to work on my first Prototype and was shocked to see that it was some-what functional.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602539259/mmagpge2ts95agdmk6pq.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I knew that I was not the only one that could benefit from this product, so I assembled a team of young and talented entrepreneurs and engineers with a vision to make your workstation more flexible and comfortable. We hope you will contribute towards a better tomorrow by providing an elegant solution to an everyday problem. </p>
<p>My Goal is to bring this solution to the masses and help each person to solve the same problem I had of elevating my tablet.  Conventionally, electronic device covers are used to protect the device, as well as raise the screen up to a viewable position on a set surface, but not elevate the device.  At Rora, we provide a solution to the problem by providing a simple and effective way to elevate the device off the surface (e.g. table) to a more ergonomically correct position.</p>

<li>We have a goal of $15,000.00 This will allow us to bring the product to market, and hopefully be able to help 1000's of people make their daily activities a little more comfortable. </li>

If Convertible: A smartphone, tablet and ultrabook in one




The If Convertible: 3 Devices, 1 Data Plan


At idealfuture, we realized that in 2014, we should have flying cars, jet packs and robots making our breakfast. Instead, we are all still running around with our cell phones in our pockets. Our laptops and tablets are only mere variations of devices that were created decades ago. Convenience these days is becoming more and more inconvenient.


We thought, “What if we could have one device that would make all the others obsolete?” Think about it… what if you could operate all of your devices on the same data plan? What if all you needed was ONE ultimate and integrated device to simplify your life? What if there was one device that could create a more productive work-space by incorporating cutting-edge hardware and software to work, play and communicate?
Together we can bring this vision to reality! We have a revised goal of $10,000 and every dollar counts! Contributions will allow us to start the process of bringing the if convertible to the world! All of our contributors will be included in the idealfuture family; we have everything from T-shirts to the limited edition Founding Series of the if convertible itself.
 - if convertible series comparison chart -



""We believe that through the power of the Indiegogo crowd funding community and the power of innovation, we will revolutionize mobile computing as we know it. At this time we've only scratched the surface of how people will soon be using this device to work, play, and communicate.""

The interchangeable CLIQ™ covers are magnetically attached and not only protect your if, but also enhances and personalizes the if's style to meet yours.       
We are ready to provide everyone with an ideal convergent mobile future…if convertible gives you what you need when you need it!









With its sleek, sophisticated, light, and compact design you will not have to worry about lugging around a heavy bag.  Aside from being the only device you will ever need to buy again, the if convertible can run off  ONE data plan.

When attached to the base, the right screen can be rotated and the device folded closed, converting into tablet mode. As a tablet it can be used flat or angled; ideal for game play or movie watching with no worry of tired hands or the extra expense of a stand.
















Dual Displays: The if features dual displays which can increase productivity by as much as 40-60%. No more having someone hover over your shoulder to see what is on your screen. With the if convertible's rotating right screen people can now see what you see. The right screen of the if convertible also detaches to become your android smartphone.







The if convertible is so versatile that it runs both android and Windows 8. When the Slingshot is detached it will run the latest android software. 
The laptop base will run off the newest version of windows. This means you will be able to run your favorite android apps while also having access to all your favorite Windows programs.

________________________________________________________




           Q: I still don't get this dual display thing?

           A:It’s easier than you think! The left screen will always be attached to the                laptop. The right screen or if slingshot rotates or detaches to be your tablet              or phone. 


Q: Android and Windows...How? 


A:With the if convertible, you can have your cake and eat it too! When the Slingshot (tm) phone module is docked, you have the world's most advanced mobile multi-display device running Windows 8. But when you take the Slingshot (tm) and put it through its paces,  it is running the latest version of Android O/S, so you have all of your favorite apps with you at all times! 



Q: Where can the if be shipped?
A: We will ship all over the world! *

Q: Warranties and Guaranteed First Run Shipping?


A: We will provide a one year warranty for the if convertible!*
Domestic and international shipping rates will apply.

A: Also, we at idealfuture really look forward to the day we are shipping our revolutionary if to the whole world! But before anyone else gets theirs, our loyal indiegogo contributors will absolutely get their if's in their hands before anyone else. 100% guaranteed!

<h2>HOW TO USE ORII?</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504954618/fwnndm1nmflfshqhqtbo.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p></figure></div>
<h2>HOW ORII WORKS?</h2>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://thumbs.gfycat.com/UltimateGivingEastsiberianlaika-size_restricted.gif"" src=""""/><p>ORII receives audio from your smartphone via a Bluetooth connection. The ring <strong>transmits sound</strong> <strong>vibration</strong> <strong>through your finger to your fingertip </strong>so that when you press your ear, you can hear the voice audio. This technology poses no health risks and used in medical-grade hearing aid devices.</p> <h3>Thousands of people have tried ORII, and it works!</h3>
<p>The first time people hear someone’s voice through their finger, it’s unlike anything they’ve tried before. If you’re wondering how it feels on your finger, the vibrations from the ring are gentle and you get used to them within the first day of using ORII.</p>
<p><strong>Watch a 20 second video of people trying ORII for the first time:</strong></p>

<div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://thumbs.gfycat.com/WellgroomedFancyHyrax-size_restricted.gif"" src="""" style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'/></div>
<div> </div>
<h3>What about Bluetooth headsets?</h3>
<div data-id=""17772873""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1502293771/jz7niry4eantmqemkaeq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>ORII is designed specifically for those <strong>short texts and phone calls sprinkled throughout your day</strong> while you’re <strong>on the go</strong>. The 1.5 hours of continuous listening time means you can handle many short text messages and calls <strong>throughout your day.</strong></p>
<p>ORII doesn’t replace Bluetooth headsets; instead, it uses similar technology to meet a different need. Bluetooth headsets are good for power talkers or when you need to be truly hands-free. <strong>ORII is for those brief but frequent calls or texts that you like taking care of while you're on the move.</strong></p>
<p> </p></figure></div>
<h2>TESTING ORII'S SOUND QUALITY</h2>
<p>The magic of bone conduction is that you can hear it loud and clear while others around you can’t hear anything. But many bone conduction products suffer from sound leakage, meaning that people nearby can hear what you can hear through your bone conduction device. This is often because they use large actuators at high power output, and there’s always a trade-off between how much power is used to create audio clarity and the amount of sound leakage generated.</p>
<div>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""344"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/wcX9eybBjG4?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0"" width=""612""></iframe></div></div>
<p>ORII’s focus is on delivering <strong>crisp and clear human voice audio</strong>. By transmitting audio via the finger, we’ve: </p>
</div>
<p>1) <strong>shortened the distance</strong> the audio needs to travel and <strong>increased audio quality</strong> </p>
<p>2) <strong>used a smaller actuator</strong> at lower power to <strong>minimize sound leakage</strong>  </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 36px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 1px;'>PRODUCT DESIGN</span></h2>
<p>There were two main considerations for product design: firstly, how can we create smart ring that could offer as many ring sizes as possible without needing to re-layout the internal components for every size; secondly, how can we create an timeless, simple, and sophisticated smart ring design that isn’t “jewelry” nor is it too “techie”?</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523429622/s6rbfwp3qla0kem0bpbt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>To create the final design for ORII, we turned to <strong>award winning Italian product designer Andrea Ponti.</strong> He has received many international prizes and awards, including <strong>first prize at the 2012 LG Mobile Design Competition</strong> for a smartphone for the visually impaired; two <strong>Red Dot Design Awards in 2015</strong>, both designed for <strong>Philips in collaboration with Gibson Innovations</strong>; two <strong>Good Design Awards</strong> awarded from Japan in 2016, and the 2017 <strong>IF Design Award</strong> for the <strong>Matrix Powerwatch</strong>, an eco-friendly smartwatch that runs exclusively on body heat.</p>

Hear and Send Texts Through Your Finger
Hear your text messages through your fingertip and simply send a message through a pair of microphones inside ORII. 
 
ORII IN THE NEWS

WHY ORII?
Who doesn’t feel like they spend too much time looking at screens? Give your eyes a break by using ORII. Pairing the ring to your phone lets you send and listen to texts without taking your phone out and looking at the screen. Breaking free from your screen has never felt easier.

Put your phone away while on the go
Built with walkers and texters in mind, ORII’s there when you need to take care of that quick text or call. Just touch your ear to send that short text message or take a quick call.
 

Clear audio, even when it's noisy
Whether on the subway or in a coffee shop, the audio is crisp and clear. How? Sound gets delivered directly to your inner ear while your finger helps to block out background noise.
 

Live the secret agent's life
Sometimes duty calls. ORII lets you discreetly handle that urgent text message. Audio is sent to your ear by touch, so even in a quiet meeting, you are the only one who can hear the message.
 

Get the most out of your voice assistant
ORII makes your phone’s voice assistant more convenient than ever before by putting it at your fingertip. You’ll find many new ways that your voice assistant can make your daily tasks easier and faster to handle.
 

What can your voice assistant do for you today? Here are just a few commands you can use:
Messaging: “Send a text to Stephen.”
Make Calls: “Call mom at home.”
Manage Calendar: ""Schedule a meeting with Kayleigh tomorrow at nine AM.”
Reminders: “Set a reminder for tomorrow.”
See a full list of Siri / Google Assistant commands
 
HOW TO USE ORII?

 
HOW ORII WORKS?
ORII receives audio from your smartphone via a Bluetooth connection. The ring transmits sound vibration through your finger to your fingertip so that when you press your ear, you can hear the voice audio. This technology poses no health risks and used in medical-grade hearing aid devices. Thousands of people have tried ORII, and it works!
The first time people hear someone’s voice through their finger, it’s unlike anything they’ve tried before. If you’re wondering how it feels on your finger, the vibrations from the ring are gentle and you get used to them within the first day of using ORII.
Watch a 20 second video of people trying ORII for the first time:

 

 
What about Bluetooth headsets?

ORII is designed specifically for those short texts and phone calls sprinkled throughout your day while you’re on the go. The 1.5 hours of continuous listening time means you can handle many short text messages and calls throughout your day.
ORII doesn’t replace Bluetooth headsets; instead, it uses similar technology to meet a different need. Bluetooth headsets are good for power talkers or when you need to be truly hands-free. ORII is for those brief but frequent calls or texts that you like taking care of while you're on the move.
 
TESTING ORII'S SOUND QUALITY
The magic of bone conduction is that you can hear it loud and clear while others around you can’t hear anything. But many bone conduction products suffer from sound leakage, meaning that people nearby can hear what you can hear through your bone conduction device. This is often because they use large actuators at high power output, and there’s always a trade-off between how much power is used to create audio clarity and the amount of sound leakage generated.


ORII’s focus is on delivering crisp and clear human voice audio. By transmitting audio via the finger, we’ve: 

1) shortened the distance the audio needs to travel and increased audio quality 
2) used a smaller actuator at lower power to minimize sound leakage  
 
PRODUCT DESIGN
There were two main considerations for product design: firstly, how can we create smart ring that could offer as many ring sizes as possible without needing to re-layout the internal components for every size; secondly, how can we create an timeless, simple, and sophisticated smart ring design that isn’t “jewelry” nor is it too “techie”?

To create the final design for ORII, we turned to award winning Italian product designer Andrea Ponti. He has received many international prizes and awards, including first prize at the 2012 LG Mobile Design Competition for a smartphone for the visually impaired; two Red Dot Design Awards in 2015, both designed for Philips in collaboration with Gibson Innovations; two Good Design Awards awarded from Japan in 2016, and the 2017 IF Design Award for the Matrix Powerwatch, an eco-friendly smartwatch that runs exclusively on body heat.
 
BUILT FOR EVERYDAY LIFE

Designed to meet IPX7 water resistance testing
ORII is splash proof, so you can wash your hands, get caught in the rain, and get sweat on ring without any worries. We don’t recommend showering or swimming with the ring on.
 

Customize your ORII notifications
Choose your favourite apps and select your key contacts and assign them a colour. The LED light will let you know what kind of notification is coming through.

 
 

Hot colors to suit your style
ORII’s scratch-proof anodized aluminium finish is now available in four colors:   Stardust Silver, Space Grey, Armor Red and Dark Night!
 

Battery that lasts you a day  

 A 50 mAh battery that translates to more than 20 short calls and over 200 text messages. Top it up with a compact charging clip.

Charging Dock & Case
We’ve also designed a charging dock that looks great on your desk but is also portable and sleek. Throw it in your bag so you can bring it with you wherever you’re.

<p><b>1. How do I choose which color of STROM I will receive?   </b></p>
<p>Once the Indiegogo campaign period ends, all of our supporters will receive a survey asking them to select which color of STROM they would like to receive. If you have pledged for multiple units, you will be able to select how much of each color you want. </p>
<p><b> 2. Can I charge STROM without having my iPhone connected?</b></p>
<p>Yes! STROM’s intelligent charging technology detects when there is no iPhone connected, and will direct power to STROM’s internal battery instead.  You already leave your Apple wall charger plugged into the outlet, even when not charging your iPhone. Now leave STROM plugged into the outlet along with your Apple wall charger. The result: STROM stays 100% charged and always ready to go.</p>
<p><b>3. Will STROM consume power when left plugged into the outlet?</b></p>
<p>No! STROM is specially designed to be left plugged into the outlet when not in use, so that its always charged and ready. Its advanced, eco-friendly,  shut-off circuitry means that once charged, it consumes no ‘Stand-by Power’.</p>
<p><b>4. Will STROM speed-charge all iPhone models?</b></p>
<p>No. STROM is specifically optimized to meet the increased charging power demand of the new iPhone 6 models and speed-charge them safely, while confirming to Apple Charging Specifications for iDevices. The Apple iPhone 6 PLUS, for instance, can actually demand over double the power (2.0 Amp) supplied by the wall charger (1.0 Amp) included with it. The older iPhone models have a peak charging power demand that does not exceed 1.0 Amp and so STROM will charge them at the same speed as your regular Apple 1.0 Amp iPhone wall charger.</p>
<p><b>5. Will STROM speed-charge my iPhone, even when charging it using the Apple iPhone wall charger?</b></p>
<p>No. STROM is specifically designed to output a higher 2.1 Amp charging current when used as a standalone portable battery pack. When charging your iPhone along with STROM using an Apple iPhone wall charger, it gives the same output current as your Apple wall charger i.e. 1.0 Amp.</p>
<p><b>6. What is the Warranty? </b> </p>
<p>We provide a one (1) year limited warranty. We guarantee you receive your STROM  free of manufacturing defects.</p>
<p><b>7. Can I change or cancel my perk? </b></p>
<p>Indiegogo policy dictates that campaign owners have no ability to adjust perk selections. That means we cannot upgrade your perk, we cannot change your perk and we cannot cancel your perk. Please note that contributions made on Indiegogo are also non-refundable.</p>
<p><b>8. Is the Apple iPhone wall charger and the Apple charging cable included?</b></p>
<p>No. We only manufacture and ship the STROM iPhone Battery Pack. You must use your own Apple iPhone wall charger and regular charging cable. </p>
<p><b>9. When was your product founded?</b></p>
<p>We started working on the product idea about 9 months ago.</p>
<p><b>10. When was the first prototype built?</b></p>
<p>In January 2015.</p>
<p><b>11. Where are you at the current stage of manufacturing?</b></p>
<p>We have already invested in the tooling and the first pilot lot of 100 units would be produced shortly. These will be used for further final testing and certification, before starting production after end of our Indiegogo Campaign.</p>

Remembering to charge another device is a hassle - but with Strom this hassle is gone as it completely integrates into your daily 'charging routine'. In essence, its Charged by Design.






Simply plug STROM in between your Apple wall charger and the USB charging cable: its intelligent circuit priorities charging your phone before its own battery. 








Designed to automatically switch to a 2.1 Amp TurboCharge mode when used as battery pack on-the-go, STROM is specially optimized to charge new iPhones fast. 






Weighing only 2.8 ounces (79 grams), STROM was designed to be lightweight and pocket-friendly with its smooth rounded edges and soft-touch rubber finish.







With its ultra-powerful 3400mAh battery capacity, STROM packs a whole lot of extra battery life and can provide more than one full charge for most smartphones.





Snapping onto your Apple wall charger (US & EU model), STROM charges as you charge your iPhone, without needing any additional outlets, chargers or cables. 




Available in black, white, and a Swiss red, STROM was designed to be aesthetically pleasing and to stray from standard industry greys.






Its advanced shut-off circuitry means that once charged, it consumes no ‘Stand-by Power’, even when left plugged into the outlet.








STROM works with iPhone, Android, and any other USB-charged device so no matter what brand you hold dear, it'll be charged and ready to go.














1) Plug your Apple-certified charger into your AC outlet.
2) Attach STROM onto your Apple charger.
3) Plug your charging cable into STROM's USB port.
4) Plug the other end of the charging cable into your phone.
5) Press the 'ON' button on STROM.
6) Now your smartphone will charge first and then STROM will charge itself.
7) Unplug your charged STROM from the Apple charger to use as battery pack.

<b>mcThings</b>
are a collection of devices and software that can be used to measure and
 control anything and
connect to the cloud. The main device is a measure and control board, 
called a mcModule, which
is a tiny low-power device that communicates wirelessly to the cloud 
through a mcRouter. mcModules are designed to be very small, consume
minimal power and therefore run for years on a coin cell.
<p>Other devices in the mcThings product line:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <b>mcRouter</b> is a WiFi bridge between the Internet and the mcModules so mcModules can communicate with the cloud. They provide 
integration with IFTTT, Facebook, Twitter, SMS, Email and other cloud 
services. WiFi setup for the mcRouter can be done on an IPhone, Android 
phone, PC or MAC and is fast and simple because the mcRouter uses TI's 
SimpleLink and SmartConfig technology. See <a href=""http://www.ti.com/tool/smartconfig"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.ti.com/tool/smartconfig<br/></a>The mcRouter also has a USB-A host to plug in a USB drive for loggin and firmware updates,<br/>
</li>
<li>
The<b> mcPlug</b> is a power plug that can wirelessly control two power outlets with solid
state switches. The maximum voltage of 250V AC and a maximum current of 16 Amp.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/736505/files/20140722142020-c98f1940957fedb2313da2d7a2f83a03_large.gif?1406064020"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<h2>The McThings vision </h2>
<h1></h1>
<p>Our vision is that eventually every house, shop, garage, etc. 
will have a large number of low-cost, low-power easy to setup sensors 
and controllers that will improve efficiency, quality of life and 
minimize power consumption. A router will connect the sensors and 
controllers to the cloud for full integration with services like 
Facebook, Twitter, SMS Email, Google+, WeMo devices etc. The McThings 
infrastructure fulfills this vision with low-power and low-cost modules,
 full internet connectivity and no programming required.</p>
<h2>Low Power </h2>
<p>The
 McModule uses a modern 32-bit low energy ARM processor which consumes 
530nA in sleep. Together with the other components the whole McModule 
consumes less than 1 µA in sleep. A 230mAh battery can power the device 
230,000 hours (26 years) in sleep mode, so the key is to let the device 
do as little as possible. An example is measuring the temperature every 
minute where the module wakes up every minute, measures the temperature 
and makes a connection to the McRouter and sends the temperature. 
Battery life would be 5 years or longer. Another example is sending a 
text when the cookie jar is opened. In this case it is maybe used once a
 day or week and battery life is even longer.</p>
<h2>The McModule is Small, Really Really Small.</h2>
<h1></h1>
<p>The McModule is 29 mm (1.1 inch)  by 17 mm (0.7 inch) and including the battery it is only 4.6 mm (0.18 inch) thick.</p>
<div>
</div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/736511/files/20140722142212-3b98ddbba9c284e91719aca65a88e45d_large.jpg?1406064132"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>No programming required
</h2>
<p>Programming is not required. A rule engine tells a McModule what
 to do and a wizard creates the rules. The wizard communicates over WiFi
 to the McRouter and they transfer the rules wirelessly to the 
McModules.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/736514/files/20140722142254-9c1d18bbfd346e96921b6143ce740008_large.gif?1406064174"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The McRouter stores the rules for all paired McModules locally in flash so after a power failure they are still available.  <br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fz8lAlBLKkIQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dz8lAlBLKkIQ&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fz8lAlBLKkIQ%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><h2>Measuring and Sensors</h2>
<p>Below is a list of sensors that can be 
used with the McModule. All measurements can be logged and used to 
control things. The McModule can measure voltage and resistance very 
accurately and can communicate with sensors that require UART, I2C or 
SPI communication. Below are some of the possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time in all McModules. Can be used with other sensors to measure 
time like how long the door of the freezer, fridge is open, multiple 
stopwatches to measure gaming times like how long does it take to drink a
 glass of beer, etc. Just add a few buttons and it works.
</li>
<li>Temperature sensor in all McModules or external sensor for 
temperatures above 200°F. Can be used in freezer, fridge, attic, inside 
the car, outside, different sides of the house, garage, shop, against 
the windows, in your dryer, are your pipes freezing, long term logging 
of any temperature, barbeque, etc.
 </li>
<li>Acceleration in all McModules. Can detect door knock, something is 
moved or touched, activity tracking, single and double and directional 
tapping (user interface), freefall and motion detecting vibration of 
machines, track when the doggy/cat door is used, oven door is open.</li>
<li>Simple button sensors to indicate a certain state or a simple push button</li>
<li>Moisture sensor. Can detect moisture in plants or outside in soil or grass, basement flooding, leakage of equipment, etc.
 </li>
<li>Rain sensor. Can detect rain and can be used in an advanced internet weather station.  
 </li>
<li>Magnetic switch. Can detect everything that moves including door opens, when windows are open or closed, etc.
 </li>
<li>Biometric sensor like Methane, Carbon Monoxide, Pollen, Dust, LPG, 
Fingerprint scanner etc. These complex sensors operate like they 
normally do and the McModule makes them wireless.
 </li>
<li>Touch sensor, like key-pad sensors, etc.
</li>
<li> Light sensors for things like detecting day/night, if the cookie jar is open or closed, shadows, etc.
 </li>
<li>Distance sensor and PIR (passive infrared sensor) to detect if somebody is in the room, etc. </li>
<li>Other sensors like Current and Voltage sensors, Force sensors, RFID readers, Infrared proximity sensors and Proximity sensors. </li>
</ul>

using a programming language.</p><ul>
<li>Indicate with the included Green and Red LED. The LED’s can be on, 
off, blink and the brightness can be controlled. Add more LED’s or other
 indicators. Combined with sensors they can indicate if there are any 
open outside doors, if there is movement in a room, if the gate is open,
 if the lights in a room are on, etc. One McModule can control 6 LED’s 
plus the internal LED’s. Other examples are the voltage of the car of 
boat battery by controlling the intensity. </li>
<li>Alphanumeric displays to display messages and other information like temperature, voltage, etc. </li>

<li>Control your lights by just tapping the McPlug or any other location </li>
<li>Measure your car battery voltage and send a message if it gets low.</li>
<li>Anything <b>you</b> can come up with.  </li>
</ul><h2>How it all started</h2><p>For one of our projects we needed 40 
temperature sensors and if the temperature did not match the required 
values it should send an Email to the company so they could send 
someone. All sensors needed to be wireless so the installation cost 
would be minimal. We used some WiFi boards but the problem was the 
power. Batteries needed to be changed every week which was not 
acceptable. Low-power wireless boards exist but they connect to phones, 
cannot work together and do not connect to the internet. </p><p>That was
 the moment when we realized that the market needs low-cost low-power 
(coin-cell) measurement modules that can work together and connect to 
the internet and cloud services. To make the product more versatile the 
measurement module must accept a wide range of sensors and controlling 
the module must be wireless, over the web and simple which means that 
programming is not an option. To make a complete product we also needed a
 control module that can switch things on or off, indicate state etc. We
 combined the measurement and control aspects and built the McModule 
where the ""M"" stands for Measurement and the ""c"" for control. </p><p>We 
started with some development boards and wrote most of the software to 
see if we could get the power down. Then we built the McRouter. To 
switch power we developed the McPlug.</p><h2>Planning</h2><p>We have 
tested all the hardware and we need to change some minor things and do 
another board-spin. Based on this we expect that the final hardware 
design will be ready the end of July. Then we can start ordering the 
components in August. Some of the components have a 12 week lead time so
 we expect that the production starts in October and will be ready for 
shipment in November. </p><p>In the mean time we have to complete the software. The state of the software is as follows:</p><ul>
<li>McModule is 60% done. We have to add more functionality to the rule engine. Expected effort 6 weeks.</li>
<li>McRouter (wireless part) is 80% done. Expected effort 2 weeks.</li>
<li>McRouter (routing part) is 60% done. Expected effort 4 weeks.</li>
<li>Maintenance program including the Wizard is 80% done. This program 
contains the rule engine interpreter and the maintenance UI. Expected 
effort 4 weeks.</li>
<li>Integration with IFTTT. Expected effort 4 weeks</li>
<li>Wireless Bootloader for the McModule. Expected effort 3 weeks.</li>
<li>McPlug is a McModule with extra hardware. Expected effort 3 weeks.</li>
</ul><p>This is about 26 weeks. We expect that we have one full time 
person working on the software and one person part-time (33%). This 
would give us a December delivery date.</p><h2>Pledges</h2><p>Don't forget that the rewards amounts are in Canadian dollars, which is about 8% lower than the US dollar.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/736575/files/20140722144255-gogoprice.png?1406065375"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h2>Technical Specifications</h2><h3><b>mcModule</b></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/736582/files/20140722144434-296b6af8fadfc8a4e35d836dd6370b09_large.jpg?1406065474"" src="""" style=""""/></p><ul>

See https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2016620887/mcthings-tiny-wireless-bluetooth-sensors-and-contr



mcThings
are a collection of devices and software that can be used to measure and
 control anything and
connect to the cloud. The main device is a measure and control board, 
called a mcModule, which
is a tiny low-power device that communicates wirelessly to the cloud 
through a mcRouter. mcModules are designed to be very small, consume
minimal power and therefore run for years on a coin cell.
Other devices in the mcThings product line:

A mcRouter is a WiFi bridge between the Internet and the mcModules so mcModules can communicate with the cloud. They provide 
integration with IFTTT, Facebook, Twitter, SMS, Email and other cloud 
services. WiFi setup for the mcRouter can be done on an IPhone, Android 
phone, PC or MAC and is fast and simple because the mcRouter uses TI's 
SimpleLink and SmartConfig technology. See http://www.ti.com/tool/smartconfigThe mcRouter also has a USB-A host to plug in a USB drive for loggin and firmware updates,


The mcPlug is a power plug that can wirelessly control two power outlets with solid
state switches. The maximum voltage of 250V AC and a maximum current of 16 Amp.


   
The McThings vision 

Our vision is that eventually every house, shop, garage, etc. 
will have a large number of low-cost, low-power easy to setup sensors 
and controllers that will improve efficiency, quality of life and 
minimize power consumption. A router will connect the sensors and 
controllers to the cloud for full integration with services like 
Facebook, Twitter, SMS Email, Google+, WeMo devices etc. The McThings 
infrastructure fulfills this vision with low-power and low-cost modules,
 full internet connectivity and no programming required.
Low Power 
The
 McModule uses a modern 32-bit low energy ARM processor which consumes 
530nA in sleep. Together with the other components the whole McModule 
consumes less than 1 µA in sleep. A 230mAh battery can power the device 
230,000 hours (26 years) in sleep mode, so the key is to let the device 
do as little as possible. An example is measuring the temperature every 
minute where the module wakes up every minute, measures the temperature 
and makes a connection to the McRouter and sends the temperature. 
Battery life would be 5 years or longer. Another example is sending a 
text when the cookie jar is opened. In this case it is maybe used once a
 day or week and battery life is even longer.
The McModule is Small, Really Really Small.

The McModule is 29 mm (1.1 inch)  by 17 mm (0.7 inch) and including the battery it is only 4.6 mm (0.18 inch) thick.



No programming required

Programming is not required. A rule engine tells a McModule what
 to do and a wizard creates the rules. The wizard communicates over WiFi
 to the McRouter and they transfer the rules wirelessly to the 
McModules.
The McRouter stores the rules for all paired McModules locally in flash so after a power failure they are still available.  Measuring and Sensors
Below is a list of sensors that can be 
used with the McModule. All measurements can be logged and used to 
control things. The McModule can measure voltage and resistance very 
accurately and can communicate with sensors that require UART, I2C or 
SPI communication. Below are some of the possibilities:

Time in all McModules. Can be used with other sensors to measure 
time like how long the door of the freezer, fridge is open, multiple 
stopwatches to measure gaming times like how long does it take to drink a
 glass of beer, etc. Just add a few buttons and it works.

Temperature sensor in all McModules or external sensor for 
temperatures above 200°F. Can be used in freezer, fridge, attic, inside 
the car, outside, different sides of the house, garage, shop, against 
the windows, in your dryer, are your pipes freezing, long term logging 
of any temperature, barbeque, etc.
 
Acceleration in all McModules. Can detect door knock, something is 
moved or touched, activity tracking, single and double and directional 
tapping (user interface), freefall and motion detecting vibration of 
machines, track when the doggy/cat door is used, oven door is open.
Simple button sensors to indicate a certain state or a simple push button
Moisture sensor. Can detect moisture in plants or outside in soil or grass, basement flooding, leakage of equipment, etc.
 
Rain sensor. Can detect rain and can be used in an advanced internet weather station.  
 
Magnetic switch. Can detect everything that moves including door opens, when windows are open or closed, etc.
 
Biometric sensor like Methane, Carbon Monoxide, Pollen, Dust, LPG, 
Fingerprint scanner etc. These complex sensors operate like they 
normally do and the McModule makes them wireless.
 
Touch sensor, like key-pad sensors, etc.

 Light sensors for things like detecting day/night, if the cookie jar is open or closed, shadows, etc.
 
Distance sensor and PIR (passive infrared sensor) to detect if somebody is in the room, etc. 
Other sensors like Current and Voltage sensors, Force sensors, RFID readers, Infrared proximity sensors and Proximity sensors. 


A mcModule reading a capacitive touch sensorA mcModule in a motion sensor
Controlling
After measuring things you often want to control, indicate or 
log things. The McModule is ideally situated to do just that without 
using a programming language.
Indicate with the included Green and Red LED. The LED’s can be on, 
off, blink and the brightness can be controlled. Add more LED’s or other
 indicators. Combined with sensors they can indicate if there are any 
open outside doors, if there is movement in a room, if the gate is open,
 if the lights in a room are on, etc. One McModule can control 6 LED’s 
plus the internal LED’s. Other examples are the voltage of the car of 
boat battery by controlling the intensity. 
Alphanumeric displays to display messages and other information like temperature, voltage, etc. 
Send Text messages based on measurements and events to a cell phone. 
Send tweets based on measurements and events to a twitter account. 
Send Emails based on measurements and events. 

Switching appliances, light, etc. that are connected to the main power with the McPlug. 
LoggingThe McRouter can log and distribute measured 
information to the cloud. This information is available in csv format 
that can be directly read by Excel or other spreadsheet programs.Measurements can easily be imported into excel from a CSV fileSome things you can do with it. 
Measure and log the temperature of any location in your house, your 
fridge, your car while it is at home, outside not too far from the 
house, in the attic, etc. 
Log temperature over years, compare the temperature with different 
wind conditions, find cold spots, calibrate your heating system and save
 energy.
Check the temperature of the hot-tub without going outside
Send a tweet, text or email when your freezer/fridge gets too warm, the hot-tub too cold, etc. 
Put one in the ice bath of a keg to make sure your beer is always cold
Use it as a dog activity tracker
Remote control anything that has a plug
Connect it to you garden furniture and switch lights on when somebody tries to move it.
Use it as a remote for all your lights
Switch your lights on and off so it looks that somebody is at home.
Measure the vibration when somebody walks up the stairs and switch lights on.
Log when doors are opened and closed, change the behavior of your kids and save energy.
Buy some low-cost motions sensors and door-sensors and build your 
own low-cost security system that sends you a text when somebody gets in
 the house so you can call the police and save hundreds on monitoring
Log the sun-rise and sunset time.
Measure when you plants, inside or out-side need water.
Get a text when someone knocks on the door. 
Detect when doors, windows or drawers are open/closed
Measure and log the moisture in your plants/flower beds/grass 
Log information from a full weather station like wind speed/direction, rain, and humidity
Get a tweet or text when someone who shouldn't open your cookie jar does it anyway
Turn on lights and a siren when a drawer with valuables is opened
Control your lights by just tapping the McPlug or any other location 
Measure your car battery voltage and send a message if it gets low.
Anything you can come up with.  
How it all startedFor one of our projects we needed 40 
temperature sensors and if the temperature did not match the required 
values it should send an Email to the company so they could send 
someone. All sensors needed to be wireless so the installation cost 
would be minimal. We used some WiFi boards but the problem was the 
power. Batteries needed to be changed every week which was not 
acceptable. Low-power wireless boards exist but they connect to phones, 
cannot work together and do not connect to the internet. That was
 the moment when we realized that the market needs low-cost low-power 
(coin-cell) measurement modules that can work together and connect to 
the internet and cloud services. To make the product more versatile the 
measurement module must accept a wide range of sensors and controlling 
the module must be wireless, over the web and simple which means that 
programming is not an option. To make a complete product we also needed a
 control module that can switch things on or off, indicate state etc. We
 combined the measurement and control aspects and built the McModule 
where the ""M"" stands for Measurement and the ""c"" for control. We 
started with some development boards and wrote most of the software to 
see if we could get the power down. Then we built the McRouter. To 
switch power we developed the McPlug.PlanningWe have 
tested all the hardware and we need to change some minor things and do 
another board-spin. Based on this we expect that the final hardware 
design will be ready the end of July. Then we can start ordering the 
components in August. Some of the components have a 12 week lead time so
 we expect that the production starts in October and will be ready for 
shipment in November. In the mean time we have to complete the software. The state of the software is as follows:
McModule is 60% done. We have to add more functionality to the rule engine. Expected effort 6 weeks.
McRouter (wireless part) is 80% done. Expected effort 2 weeks.
McRouter (routing part) is 60% done. Expected effort 4 weeks.
Maintenance program including the Wizard is 80% done. This program 
contains the rule engine interpreter and the maintenance UI. Expected 
effort 4 weeks.
Integration with IFTTT. Expected effort 4 weeks
Wireless Bootloader for the McModule. Expected effort 3 weeks.
McPlug is a McModule with extra hardware. Expected effort 3 weeks.
This is about 26 weeks. We expect that we have one full time 
person working on the software and one person part-time (33%). This 
would give us a December delivery date.PledgesDon't forget that the rewards amounts are in Canadian dollars, which is about 8% lower than the US dollar.Technical SpecificationsmcModule

</div></div>","Only ¼” thick and about the size of a credit card, the Jumper Card can charge your phone and other digital devices from any USB port or its own battery.
This little powerhouse packs lots of great features including an sd slot to store up to 128 GB of data.  Carry your resume, website, product info, company details, photos, videos, files and other important data with you.
The Jumper Card battery holds about an hour of power, so when your phone begins to fade, you can get a 'juice-boost' to continue making calls, transferring data, grabbing files, downloading videos & listening to music.
It charges and syncs your phone at the same time, and the fold-out cables let you transfer files and power up your other devices.
The Jumper Card even includes a bright little LED flashlight for low light situations, and a status indicator that lets you know when your Card is finished charging.
                          
Data Storage:   Don't want to store your proprietary information on your phone or on the Cloud?  No problem - load up your private data on your Jumper Card!  You  can carry your valuable data with you on your JumperCard's SD card and free up your phone's memory.Business Info:   Want to give prospects, clients and associates the perfect gift?   Give them a Jumper Card loaded with  your business information, product pics, videos and contact info.      They'll think of you every time they charge their phone.

<p>My name is Ken Wilson, I'm an entrepreneur with passion to create and develop products using my 20 year history of making sunglasses.  I like to create products but money has always limited my ability. I am happy when I design something and see someone in the public using what was once an idea.  I have never made a lot of money but have made a lot of  people happy using what I designed.  See my website <a href=""http://www.Liquidpolarized.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.Liquidpolarized.com</a> and read the comments at the bottom of the product pages. Feel free to google my name under Entrepreneur Magazine Gatorz Ken Wilson.  I have a proven track record with a long history.</p>
<p>I am coming to you with my idea to help me get Wick it Clean off the ground.  I see the need for people to have something to clean their cell phones, Ipads, sunglasses and more.  I have worked very hard to create a product from scratch that will clean anything with an optical surface.  The only thing on the market is a squirt bottle and towel that competes with the Wick.  </p>
<p>This project means a lot to me and I have put a lot of time into this product to make sure it is successful.  I believe you will see lots of companies making something similar to this once it hits the public.  I need money to pay for the production and marketing to get Wick it to consumer.</p>
<p>Some of you may have seen other commercial products I have made called Gatorz.com sunglasses or Liquidsunglasses.com  I started both of those companies from as little as $75.00 start up funds.  I have vision and I make it happen and those two companies have sold millions of dollars of sunglasses made here in the USA.  I am using my same formula to make Wick it, but I need your help to get it off the ground faster.</p>
<p>I am asking for a small safe amount of money that will pay for Wick its production cost of only $5,000  I am offering the wick it for pledges for $19.95 and other pledges for volume.  If your not a contributor please do me a favor by helping spread the word.  When doing so use the Indiegogo share tools!</p>
