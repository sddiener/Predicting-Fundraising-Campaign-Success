<p>My name is Moty Brill, i am an Israeli scientist holding a Ph.d in Nuclear Engineering. During 2007 I started to look into wave energy and developed a device that uses the energy to produce electricity. At that time Israel suffered from water shortage and I modified the design to desalinate seawater.</p>
<p>During 2011 I've met a member of government of Solomon Islands and decided to modify the design for 3rd world, isolated villages. People that die each day from lack of drinking water and diarrhea.</p>
<p>It moved me because nobody cares about them.</p>
<p> This will not be a ""money maker"" project; it will not be a huge project with hundreds of workers. It will be a small, innovative, robust device which those people will be able to maintain, and it will produce precious drinking water.</p>
<p>I am looking for funds to build the first ever solution for those human beings. I am confident that after the first device will prove it is feasible, the World Bank and other NGO's will contribute their money to save those innocent lives.</p>
<p>Help me save lives.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>I am looking for $650,000 which is my best estimation of the cost of detailed design, building the device in Israel and transfering it to the location in the Solomon Islands. The desalination container will cost ~$50,000 and the Hydraulics cost ~$40,000. The main construction which is a large and heavy marine device will cost ~$150,000. Detailed design ~$50,000 and shipment, deployment, preparation of the site and salaries for the staff will get us to ~$550,000. The rest of the money is for the unexpected expenses. </p>
<p>Perks could have been the usual stuff: T shirts, medals, images etc. but, since we want to change the world, it seems to me that as I am working for the benefit of those poor people, you will understand and join me.</p>
<p>You are buying real drinking WATER. Cost of production is $6/1,000 gallons. This volume is enough for a family of 4 for a month.</p>
<p>if you donate $18 (drinking water for one person for a year) we will send you a letter of gratitude.</p>
<p>$60 will cover a family for a year and we will send a poster of the device and the happy villagers</p>
<p>$2,000 will buy water for the whole village for a year. your name will be commemorated on a special monument located in the village you saved.</p>
<p>$10,000 is our Platinum medalist. You will be invited as our guest of honor when the device will be delivered to the local villagers, to witness the difference you made first hand.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In case we will not raise the whole sum, we will try to raise the rest from other sources and NGO's and in the worst case scenario we will advance the detail planning until we run out of money.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>This project is a world changer. According to the UN, water scarcity will be the next global crisis. At that point the poor and weak people will die because of lack of drinking water. It is as simple as that. About one out of seven people will die because of water shortage. WE CAN MAKE THE DIFFERENCE. Together we can show the world that we found a solution just for those people, small, compact, cheap and easy to build and  duplicate. We can change the future and you can be part of this dream.</p>
<p>200 families in Solomon Islands will have clean drinking water every day for the rest of their lives. 1,000 people count on us for this solution. They don't have electricity, they don't have water pipes and they don't have money to buy water. Let us show that we can help.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If you have connections to NGO's that contribute to the 3rd world and/or friends that have marine knowhow, it can be a huge help to our project. Please tell your friends and colleagues about us and one day you might be proud that you changed the future of those people.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Pete Holman and I have dedicated my life to helping enhance the health, fitness and performance of others. Today I am doing some of my most significant work in helping a wonderful non-profit called the Rocky Mountain Stroke Center. <a href=""http://www.strokecolorado.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.strokecolorado.org</a> I will be holding an event called ""Stroke for Stroke"" which is simply attempting your personal best at the 500 meter row on a concept 2 rowing ergometer. Entry fee is a donation in the amount of $20 which will help fund social support, physical therapy services, community outreach and general health care for stroke survivors and their families. As you know, in these days of financial cut-backs, non-profits have been hit extremely hard; your contributions will make difference in many peoples lives!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Each participant gets entered into a raffle to win a TRX Suspension Trainer, TRX Rip Trainer, and an Ultimate Sand Bag (special thanks to Josh Henkin owner and creator of USB for this generous contribution.)

Don't worry, you have 6 weeks to train prior to ""throwing down"" your best time prior to the deadline Nov. 17th! You must take a picture of your time and post it on my Facebook site (Pete Holman at TRX) prior to Nov. 17th 2013 to be qualified for the free Chaos Threads t-shirts and samurai sword for best overall time. </p>

</p>
<p>Levitation
   stores kinetic energy generated during knee flexion and restores that energy
   upon extension. The result is a revolutionary product that not only stabilizes
   the joint, but also enhances strength and endurance while providing shock
   absorption to the most commonly injured joint in the body. Key features are
   adjustable force-output, customizable force-response (made to order), quick release strapping

<p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Can Levitation be claimed on Insurance?</b>
</p>
<p>Our customers with medical insurance have been able to successfully claim their braces against their medical insurance plan. Coverage varies by plan, but is often in the 80%-100% range, and you may require a prescription from your doctor. Check with your insurance provider if you are unsure of your coverage amount or requirements. Also, be sure to let us know if you plan to claim the brace under insurance so that we can send you the appropriate receipt(s).

<p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">
What does your warranty cover?</b>
</p>
<p>Our braces include a lifetime limited warranty on the brace shell and a one year limited warranty on the hinge mechanism. This is NOT to say we don’t expect our hinges to last – we have built and tested them to last for at least 8-10+ years for an everyday user. However, if you are putting your brace to extreme use – like skiing every day of the year through endless mogul fields, or surfing/sailing and not properly cleaning the salt water from your brace, your hinge may require maintenance or replacement. Full details of the warranty will be shipped with your brace(s).

What We Need
We are asking for any donations to operate a free Food Center, Rebuild Homes, provide Clothing, and basic Medical Assistant  for Survivors of super Typoon Haiyan in Tacloban City, Philippines. I know the logistics of the area very well and will with local community leaders to help restores as many Tacloban City residence as possible, who lost everything they own and are still 
suffering from the devastation caused by the storm.  We are looking for sponsorships to pay for the free Food Center, basic Medical Care, Homes Rebuilding effort, and Clothing to communities in Tacloban City that were most 
affected by Typhoon Haiyan.

<p><span style=""font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">We feel that it is unnatural for our food source to be far away from our living space, and for our entertainment technology to be more easily accessible. It is unnatural for any agenda to exist that does not take into consideration the peace and happiness of all Life. We would therefore like to provide the opportunity for humans to live in a simple, sustainable, harmonious, and peaceful way upon the Earth, and come into their highest spiritual and creative potential. We focus especially on healing females as a contribution to planetary balance, as the Earth is currently under a masculine-dominant imalance</span></span><br/><br/></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">This initial sum of money we are asking for is to cover our current living costs, so that we are able to start producing free healing music and giving free healing sessions. Other than living costs, $1500 would initially go towards musical instruments and minor recording equipment. With rent covered, we would be able to spend more time networking for the establishment of a permanent AUM Love retreat center, and developing our websites that offer information on conscious living. </span></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">We have established the limit as a way of ensuring our immediate stability, yet o</span></span>ur main focus is to expand our practice and establish a permanent retreat center. Contributing to living costs helps us to be stable enough to continue networking and producing media, and is the main point of this campaign, however, if the opportunity arises for us to be go directly into a permanent center or a larger center that would allow us to expand our practices, this would be ideal, and so excess funding past our limit is welcome. </span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Our generation is in the position to change the way humans live upon Mother Earth. We see the way material resources are being funneled out into vanity, war, and other harmful causes, and would like a chance to do something positive with it instead. We intend to establish a fully sustainable healing retreat center with fresh well water, solar power, and insulated building materials, in which our community would be able to grow and preserve its own organic food/medicine in a greenhouse, learn yoga, meditation and healthy diet, and develop individual and group creative talents.</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">All of these efforts stem from the idea that Love is the core essence of all religion and spirituality, and at AUM Love, we resonate with any discipline or practice that inspires love and the service of all Life.

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p></div>","AUM Love is a community based in conscious living.
In essence AUM Love is dedicated to:

Benefiting and serving life through personal and collective spiritual expansion.

Allocating material resources towards sustainable living practices, and physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual healing, rather than the unconscious practices of war, unhealthy living, selfish material pursuit, or any other model of commerce that does not take into consideration the health and happiness of all life.

Rebalancing the collective consciousness through awareness of the Divine Feminine.

The unity and harmony of all religion and spirituality in Love.

A healthy, peaceful, happy, and harmonious existence with the Earth Mother and her inhabitants.
 
We see the essence of all religion and spirituality as Love, and offer information and practices on yoga, meditation, healthy eating, and overall conscious living as a way of realizing this divine Love.
We would like to establish a fully sustainable healing retreat center, where community members and retreatants would live simple, fulfilling, service-based lives, and receive free healing sessions that would include massage, reiki, yoga/meditation instruction, sound healing, creative expression, and anything else that inspires Love.
We feel that it is unnatural for our food source to be far away from our living space, and for our entertainment technology to be more easily accessible. It is unnatural for any agenda to exist that does not take into consideration the peace and happiness of all Life. We would therefore like to provide the opportunity for humans to live in a simple, sustainable, harmonious, and peaceful way upon the Earth, and come into their highest spiritual and creative potential. We focus especially on healing females as a contribution to planetary balance, as the Earth is currently under a masculine-dominant imalance
Our community encompasses many of the categories on Indiegogo such as music, religion, writing, art, food, photography, environment/technology, education, health, and dance. In essence we are developing a sustainable community based in conscious living and spiritual expansion.
In a community setting we would produce and offer music, poetry, and healing sessions for free. 
 
Here are some of the categories on Indiegogo that we fit into:
 
Music:
We all enjoy a wide variety of music, and love to produce both acoustically and electronically. The music we channel is a blend of ancient Eastern spirituality, tribal/shamanic cultures, and contemporary, intelligent electronic music. We are also experimenting with using different healing frequencies in electronic music, and incorporating the healing tones of instruments like crystal sound bowls and pan drums. Our intention, when support has given us some stability, is to produce and release free healing music.

Religion:
Having studied many religions and one of us having received a BA in Religion, it is our main interest in life to unite all beings under Love, which is the true source, purpose, and end to all religious pursuit. We practice meditation and other techniques from a variety of cultures and resonate with anything that brings awareness to one's Soul essence.
Yoga page on Aum Love- 
http://aumlove.org/?page_id=111

Writing:
All of us enjoy writing blogs, articles, and poetry, and are looking for an opportunity to be able to offer our writings to the world for free. We like to write about practical spirituality, give tips on healthy living, and channel divinely inspired poetry.
See examples here-
 http://aumlove.org/?page_id=2057

Health: 
Everything we do at AUM Love is to promote a healthy life, both internally and externally. When we are contacting our soul's joy through meditation, feeding our body lovingly with high energy foods, and contributing to the happiness of others through our daily service, we exist in a pure state of life, full of Love.
The ways we come into full health are through dietary cleansing, massage, reiki/energy healing, yoga, meditation, communing with Nature, and any other natural inclinations of the Soul.
Healing Arts page- 
http://aumlove.org/?page_id=207

Art:Art represents the creative potency of life. As spiritual beings, it is natural for us to create spontaneously from the Love in our hearts. We encourage art and any other creative expression that allows us an outlet for spiritual expression and expansion, uplifting and inspiring others at the same time.

Food: 
The diet we practice is an organic, live-food diet. We have found this diet most conducive to spiritual awakening as it provides immediate usable energy, does not weigh the body down unnecessarily, and gives us beauty and longevity. Living foods also provide us with the most nutrients and enzymes possible, as the food's life-force is still fully intact.
On retreat, we would like to transition people onto a mostly raw diet. On our website we offer diet tips and recipes.
See our Soulfood page on Aum Love- http://aumlove.org/?page_id=326

Photography:
As amateur photographers, our website has inspired us to take many photos and we have fallen in love with capturing Life on film.
http://aumlove.org/?page_id=1457

Environment/technology:
The retreat center we are planning would be fully sustainable. We currently are focused on one main interest, a retreat center close to our area that is run on solar power, has a well for fresh water, and is under land conservation, ensuring the area stays pristine. As Earth and her inhabitants shift into a more harmonious way of life, green, ego-friendly technology helps us to thrive in a healthy and loving relationship with our planet and global society.
http://aumlove.org/?page_id=245

Education:
All of the spiritual paths and traditions we have studied have offered us an abundance of information that would be our joy to share with others. AUM Love knows that each Soul has the same infinite potential, and we would like all community members to be adept in any and all subjects that are inspiring and helpful to the community and planet. Studying and growing in subjects such as gardening, yoga, and crafting allows us to create a viable, sustainable, and loving community,

Dance:
Dance is one of the main ways we express the freedom of spirit and joy of life. It is a deep spiritual practice, that is a main focus of our community.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HePRmLL8H4&...

Video/web:
We recently launched our website, aumlove.org, which we will be updating from time to time with articles, blogs, poetry, recipes, and videos.
We are also developing a website on the ancient spiritual path of Tantra that we will most likely be launching this month.

Our website- http://www.aumlove.orgComing soon- http://www.aumlovetantra.com
What We Need & What You Get
$5,400
This initial sum of money we are asking for is to cover our current living costs, so that we are able to start producing free healing music and giving free healing sessions. Other than living costs, $1500 would initially go towards musical instruments and minor recording equipment. With rent covered, we would be able to spend more time networking for the establishment of a permanent AUM Love retreat center, and developing our websites that offer information on conscious living. 
We have established the limit as a way of ensuring our immediate stability, yet our main focus is to expand our practice and establish a permanent retreat center. Contributing to living costs helps us to be stable enough to continue networking and producing media, and is the main point of this campaign, however, if the opportunity arises for us to be go directly into a permanent center or a larger center that would allow us to expand our practices, this would be ideal, and so excess funding past our limit is welcome.

The Impact
Our generation is in the position to change the way humans live upon Mother Earth. We see the way material resources are being funneled out into vanity, war, and other harmful causes, and would like a chance to do something positive with it instead. We intend to establish a fully sustainable healing retreat center with fresh well water, solar power, and insulated building materials, in which our community would be able to grow and preserve its own organic food/medicine in a greenhouse, learn yoga, meditation and healthy diet, and develop individual and group creative talents.
All of these efforts stem from the idea that Love is the core essence of all religion and spirituality, and at AUM Love, we resonate with any discipline or practice that inspires love and the service of all Life. We have been given the information and lifestyle necessary to provide people with simple and satisfying lives based in spiritual expansion. We intend to develop a template for conscious living that this and other generations can emulate.
We also understand that the planet is being ruled by aggressive masculine mentalities, and wish to contribute to shifting consciousness through the information and retreats we offer.

<h3>What's This All About?</h3>
<p>For those of you who know me, my name is Elif and I am a 5th year medical student at UNSW. As part of my medical elective I have the privilege to travel to countries far less privileged than we are at home. I will be spending four weeks in December in a small hospital near Mount Meru in a town called Arusha - which is located inland in Tanzania, close to the Serengeti. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Map of Tanzania - Arusha In Box"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.serengeti-big-cats-safaris.com/images/map.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Map of Tanzania - Arusha In Box""/></p>
<p>The hospital here like many hospitals in Africa relies heavily on NGOs and foreign aid for funding of supplies and equipment, and often many of the medical problems faced no longer exist in the first world. I am hoping to be able to make a small difference by contributing back to the hospital I am placed at, and have the unique advantage of seeing first hand what items are really needed. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; The Impact</h3>
Every dollar counts, but the more money raised the more lasting contribution we are able to make to the hospital. If we are able to raise a more sizable contribution the majority of money will go to purchasing equipment that is much needed by the hospital, otherwise various smaller items such as medication and bandages will be bought. All of the money fundraised will be used to purchase medical supplies and equipment from the local Medical Stores Department (you can access their catalogue and price list here <a href=""http://www.msd.or.tz/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.msd.or.tz</a>). One of the benfits to purchasing item in Tanzania, is supporting the local manufacturers and suppliers as well as doing away with unnecessary costs for postage and customs, meaning all the money goes directly to funding items much needed by the hospital. Here is a bit of an example of what your contribution could buy:
<p> </p>
<p><strong>$1              Thermometer</strong></p>
<p><strong>$5              Mosquito Net</strong></p>
<p><strong>$10           50 IV Cannulas </strong></p>
<p><strong>$15           100 Pairs of Sterile Surgical Gloves</strong></p>
<p><strong>$20           1000 Tablets of Amoxicillin (Antibiotic)</strong></p>
<p><strong>$25           Stethoscope</strong></p>
<p><strong>$50           Sphygmomanometer (BP Machine)</strong></p>
<p><strong>$150         Hospital Bed</strong></p>
<p><em>Another example of the impact you can have is in treating malaria, it costs only $10 for treatment with Quinine a drug to treat Malaria and only $5 for a Mosquito net which is the best prevention. </em>In 2010, there were about 216 million malaria cases and over half a million malaria deaths, 90% of which occurred in the African Region, mostly among children under five years of age. </p>

<p>The Fundraiser is to provide Nicole with 2 fantastic wigs while she endures chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer.</p>
<p>The campaign is called, ""I Care for Nicole's Hair.""</p>
<p><a href=""http://igg.me/p/243024?a=1160904"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://igg.me/p/243024?a=1160904</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is Nicole's story.  (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRXHwvyZAC0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRXHwvyZAC0</a>)</p>
<p>On June 30th, after 3 years of dating, Nicole and my younger brother Tom got engaged. On July 30th Nicole was diagnosed with a very rare and aggressive form of breast cancer called clear cell cancer. On August 20th she had a double mastectomy. On October 8th she starts her first of 8 chemotherapy treatments. She is 27 years old. </p>
<p>I want to give you an example of the type of person Nicole is. The day she was having her double mastectomy surgery, she was lying in bed waiting for the surgeon. Her mom was in the room with her. I came in to visit her. We were talking and she said to me ""I'm sorry I'm a little grumpy today."" and as she was being wheeled off to surgery, she was waving to my brother with a smile and saying I love you. She is just amazing. </p>
<p>I couldn't even imagine how I would deal with the magnitude of something like this. She is so brave and positive and so full of love. She is a light that makes this world a brighter place.</p>
<p>My mom as well as several family members are breast cancer survivors. The more people I talk with about this, the more I realize that just about everyone knows someone affected by breast cancer. Because Nicole's cancer was so aggressive and rare, had she waited, the diagnosis would have been terminal. Nicole's cancer was detected in the infancy stages. With her double mastectomy surgery and  chemotherapy treatment, she now has an 86% chance of survival.</p>
<p>Whether it's a dollar or a hundred dollars, every donation counts and every donation is gratefully appreciated. What's equally important is to pass on the story. Spread the word. Share your story with Nicole. Offer your words of encouragement. Pass on Nicole's story. It may just help someone with early detection. Early detection saves lives. Early detection saved Nicole's life.</p>
<p>I'm trying to raise $5000. This amount will buy 2 wigs made of human hair. It will look the most realistic and feel the most comfortable. With all she has been thrown, she at least deserves to have a wig that makes her feel at ease.</p>
<p>We have 3 very personalized breast cancer awareness perks we are offering.</p>
<p>At the $25 contribution you will receive a pink band with ""I Care for Nicole's Hair"" inscribed.</p>
<p>At the $50 contribution you will receive a white t-shirt with my original designed girl drawing silk-screened on the front and ""I Care for Nicole's Hair"" on the back. </p>
<p>At the $100 contribution you will receive a custom made breast cancer awareness birch candle. These candles are all one of a kind, hand made by my mom. Trying to describe them does them no justice. They are beautiful.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a Certified Counsellor (Canadian Counselling and Psychotherapy Association) with over 20 years experience in human services. In that time I have been witness to and experienced myself what is known as ""compassion fatigue"" and burnout. Helpers in the field have big hearts and a passion for helping and contributing to others. The demands of this work and the lower remuneration and benefits that these jobs typically offer are barriers to consistent self-care and, as a result, long-term wellness. </p>
<p>For this reason, turnover and rates of burnout and compassion fatigue in human services is very high.</p>
<p>We all want the most skilled, compassionate and experienced helpers to be there for our loved ones when needed, so what can we do to help?</p>
<p>Research clearly identifies self care and supportive connections as key protective and restorative factors in preventing and recovering from burnout and compassion fatigue.</p>
<p>Rolling Hills Health and Wellness Retreat is a two day intensive retreat for helpers in human services that provides an invaluable foundation of self-care experience, knowledge and support that is easily integrated into ongoing practice and a way of life. This enables helpers to continue contributing with care and passion to others.</p>
<p>Your contribution to this campaign not only supports helpers who attend the retreat, but the many people they support and help as well. In other words, you will be contributing to the health and well-being of potentially 10, 20, 100 (or more) people.  Talk about a viral effect!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The campaign goal is $4750 to make this retreat happen. This includes: </p>
<p>     -$2000 for lodging, meals and meeting room rentals</p>
<p>     -$1000 for practitioners, teachers and session leaders</p>
<p>     -$1000 for one massage for each participant by a Certified Massage Therapist</p>
<p>     -$650 for additional supplies, administration fees and taxes</p>
<p>In addition to making a difference in the lives of countless people, those of you who can contribute $25 or more will receive a summary of anonymous impact statements from participants. Contributors of $100 or more will receive an autographed music CD that includes the song Rolling Hills from the campaign video. Those who contribute $1000 or more will also have their name and/or company name identified as a sponsor of the retreat on printed and visual documents during the retreat.</p>
<p>Rest assured that all contributions made will go toward the retreat. If the target fundraising goal is not met, the retreat will go ahead. I am committed to making this happen!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We've all experienced the care and support of a helper at some time in our life when we most needed it. This is our opportunity to pay it forward and make sure skilled, compassionate and experienced helpers are there for others who need them. </p>
<p>I have extensive experience organizing/leading groups and retreats as well as 10 years specializing in resilience. Those who participate will come away with an incredible foundation of self-care experience and knowledge that transforms lives and leads to long-term health and well-being.</p>

Pancreatic cancer is a malignant neoplasm originating from transformed cells arising in tissues forming the pancreas. The most common type of pancreatic cancer, accounting for 95% of these tumors, is adenocarcinoma (tumors exhibiting glandular architecture on light microscopy) arising within the exocrine component of the pancreas. A minority arise from islet cells, and are classified as neuroendocrine tumors. The signs and symptoms that eventually lead to the diagnosis depend on the location, the size, and the tissue type of the tumor, and may include abdominal pain, lower back pain, and jaundice (if the tumor compresses the bile duct).
Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States[1] and the eighth worldwide.[2] Pancreatic cancer has an extremely poor prognosis: for all stages combined, the 1- and 5-year relative survival rates are 25% and 6%, respectively;[3] for local disease the 5-year survival is approximately 15% [3][4] while the median survival for locally advanced and for metastatic disease, which collectively represent over 80% of individuals,[4] is about 10 and 6 months respectively.[5] Individuals vary, however - some are only diagnosed when they are already terminally ill and therefore only have a few days or weeks. Others have slower progression and may live a couple of years even if surgery is not possible.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Our Time in a Tanzanian Orphanage</h3>
<p>My name is Katie Wauchope and I lived in an orphanage in Arusha, Tanzania from September 2011 to February 2012. For three of those months, I was joined by Kayla Price and we are now launching this campaign together.</p>
<p>The idea behind our fundraising came about whilst we were conducting surveys for the orphanage files. The orphanage supports 250 children in a small town called Ngara Mtoni just north of Arusha. These children attend classes at a centre run by the orphanage and receive occassional clothing donations and basic support. However, it was evident that they were living in extreme poverty. Among the questions asked by the survey, we asked if the children slept under a mosquito net. The overwhelming answer was no, despite the acknowledgment that suspected malaria cases were common and sadly, had resulted in child fatalities.</p>
<p>We want to provide all of these children with a mosquito net. Please, we need your help to make our idea a reality.</p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"">The Specifics</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>We need $3700 in total to acheive our goal. I live in Scotland so some of the fundraising has taken place over here but we are still a long way from the target!</p>
<p>The nets are being provided and shipped (airfreight) by a Scottish company who provide bulk orders of mosquito nets to large corporations. The family who run the business have close ties with Tanzania themselves, and gave us a generous discount.</p>
<p>We will be sending 165 double size nets (perfect for the whole family!) at $12 each and 35 single nets at $9 (these are approximate prices converted from GBP). Add all that up with the cost of sending by air and delivery to the orphanage (more expensive than by boat, but much more reliable) and you get $3700!</p>

We want to provide all of these children with a mosquito net. Please, we need your help to make our idea a reality.
The Specifics


We need $3700 in total to acheive our goal. I live in Scotland so some of the fundraising has taken place over here but we are still a long way from the target!
The nets are being provided and shipped (airfreight) by a Scottish company who provide bulk orders of mosquito nets to large corporations. The family who run the business have close ties with Tanzania themselves, and gave us a generous discount.
We will be sending 165 double size nets (perfect for the whole family!) at $12 each and 35 single nets at $9 (these are approximate prices converted from GBP). Add all that up with the cost of sending by air and delivery to the orphanage (more expensive than by boat, but much more reliable) and you get $3700!
Some facts about Malaria


It is preventable yet a child still dies from malaria every single minute. We know, you've heard that one before. But really think about it.
It affects almost half of the world's population, 90% of the fatalities in Africa.
Malaria carrying mosquitos bite predominantly at night, making nets an effective preventative.
In Tanzania, an estimated 60 000 people die as a result of malaria every year, 80% of these being children under the age of five.

<p>Our

Water is a really special
element with peculiar characteristics.
Vibrations are spreading much faster in the water than in the air. Sounds are
nothing else then special audible
vibrations. Through the fast spreading
ability of water, sound has the power to
reach down to the
smallest cells in our body. Thus vibrations have the opportunity and

<p>The
Sound
Therapy (for

works with „universal sounds“ that
means those
sounds
that derive themselves
from
the movements of the planets and stars in the universe. This is one of the philosophies of humankind that act on the assumption that the big is mirrored in the small. Thus the
sounds of the universe represent as well our own balanced vibration setting. Therefore working
with them helps us to connect ourselves again with the BIG, the universe, working with special tuning
forks, chimes, singing bowls etc.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If
that sounds a bit too spiritual for you please wait a second and read
the next passage looking at the scientific view on the power of vibrations.</p>

<p>There
are important and well-known names that planted the basics for the

As was the case with these ambitious challenges, we designed the remote mHealth

<h2><b>Our Story &amp; Team</b></h2>
<hr/>
<p>Symmetry Therapeutics was born out of years of research. Our technology was developed at Skidmore College, a liberal arts college located in Saratoga Springs, NY, when Jon Brestoff Parker was working in the laboratory of Dr. Thomas Reynolds an expert in metabolic diseases. Jon then went on to earn his Masters in Public Health on the George J. Mitchell Scholarship and then enrolled in the MD/PhD Physician-Scientist program at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine. When Jon finished his PhD, he met Milad Alucozai, another Mitchell Scholar hailing from Purdue University who had a strong background in business and science. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438841260/o1f6epoqbzxma1cnbxy6.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>As a team, Jon, Thomas, and Milad realized that they had all the tools and know-how to develop a new anti-obesity treatment and formed Symmetry Therapeutics, put their own money on the line, and surrounded themselves with world-renowned experts in academia, business, regulatory affairs, and intellectual property to advance their lead therapeutics candidate to clinical trials and the market. With the team and foundation in place, they set out to become different from traditional pharma, as the world’s first community-powered pharma company supported by you. </p>

<p>My friend Mike has Malignant Myoepithelioma.  It is a rare form of cancer which can't be treated in his hometown of Buffalo.  Mike and his wife will have to travel to Boston for his treatment.

<p>Please bear with me because I'm not that great at talking about myself. My name is Mike Tyson, no relation to the boxer or the chicken, and I have cancer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This all started out with a chronic pain that no one seemed able to explain for the last three years until finally an MRI in mid-December showed a baseball-sized tumor attached to my spine and one of my ribs. The part on my spine was putting pressure on my spinal cord and the neurosurgeon was rather amazed that I wasn't showing signs of paralysis or other loss of function. I had emergency spinal surgery and I'm now partially spineless, as I like to joke about, due to the removal of pieces of my T-3, T-4, and T-5 vertebrae. I also came away with a reduced tumor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The biopsy came back as Malignant Myoepithelioma which is an incredibly rare form of cancer that is hard to find any real facts on Google. To make matters even more rare, my treatment consists of Proton Radiation Therapy which is offered in only nine places in the United States, Buffalo is not one of those places.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before all of this hapenned, I was a full-time graduate student working to become a teacher. I was working in the Department of Media Studies’ Equipment room at my school and at an after school program because I love working with kids and I needed that help to make ends meet. My wife GiGi is also a student and she is on permanent disability and the lion's share of our income has come from financial aid and student loans while we've been going through school. Now I am unable to work or go to school and our income has been drastically cut. To add to this, the medical bills are already piling up and, even though I have insurance, I will need help with a place to stay in the closest place that does Proton Therapy, Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As much as I hate to ask for help from others, I know that GiGi and I cannot weather this storm by ourselves. So many people have already stepped up to offer direct assisstance or even help in fundraising and these people are angels in my estimation. Any little bit of help will get us that much closer to making it through this whirlwind and will be immensely appreciated.</p>

internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women. In some
cases, girls bleed to death or die from infections. Later in life, FGM can lead
to complications in childbirth and increase the risk of the mother and/or baby
dying. The practice also violates women's rights to health, security and
physical integrity, the right to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment, and the right to life when the procedure results in death.

people die each year due to inequalities in global health. More tan 150 million
people face unaffordable health care costs each year. And more than 100 million
people each year are plunged into poverty. It’s no longer enough for any one
group or country to take action. What we face is a global crisis that needs a
global movement to fix it. BE THE CHANGE.  BE A GRANNY. DONATE TO A GRANNY today. Every amount counts, please support our Barefoot Movement
We are coming together as one unified voice to send a powerful 
message that the
time to take action has come; a time to end Female Genital Mutilation and 
promote
women’s reproductive health is now.  Join us, support us, donate to us 
and let's remind the world of the crisis women are facing.  The Barefoot Grannies works on a completely volunteer basis in
order to change their communities. They want to reach out to thousands of women
and men every month!
To make this possible, we need your help to raise funds to
train them, provide small grants, purchase bicycles so that they reach distant communities and provide technical support and build their 
capacity to make them more effective.  Your support will improve on their performance and
effectiveness. To give you a sense
of some of the costs:$80 - Will be used to but one bicycle for a granny to reach more communities. We need to buy 80 bicycles. $100 - Will be used to provide scholastic materials and beddings for girls rescued and will help them get education.$204 -  is the cost of one-time fistula collective surgery. Some extreme cases require surgery twice or thrice. $500 - Will be donated to a Group of Barefoot Grannies. A $500 grant covers a 3 months period$1000 - Is a 6 months grant to one group of Barefoot GranniesIf
you are able to contribute in exchange for any of our perks, we are incredibly
grateful and the Barefoot Grannies and us will responsibly put those funds to purpose.We are ICOD Action Network,  a Uganda based nonprofit
founded in March 2008. ICOD

everyday throughout their communities educating them about the dangers of
Female Genital Mutilation and are working so hard to improve women’s reproductive
health. We are making their visions a reality, please donate to the #BarefootGrannies today.


Through
technical support,  resource allocation, mentorship, leadership training, and network building, we are working with 219 grannies from 8 Community Based Groups  of women and grannies to address reproductive health issues in their communities. These are the women and grannies on the frontlines of change working
to strengthen women’s rights, improve girls education, increase economic
opportunity for women, and promote human rights in their communities. By
providing education, outreach and training led by grannies in the rural
communities where women live, we are spreading the word: reproductive rights is
the right of every woman, no matter where she lives.We have a history
of working with and supporting the evolution of small grassroots organizations
and groups organizations as key means of developing sustainable local capacity.
Our work has impacted more than 100,000
people since 2008. People like you have supported our work!
We believe that strengthening
local capacity will ensure sustainability of  local reproductive health initiatives. 
MARY is a local human rights activist and the co-founder
of Kamesoi Women's Group, a group of granneis that moves around communities teaching about
the dangers of Female Genital Mutilation, importance of girl-child education and linking service providers to women with health complications. Invest in Mary's commitment to promote women's reproductive rights.
Click here to see what Barefoot Grannies Model works. Learn about what we do and how we are
able to change the lives of women in rural Uganda. We have achieved amazing results using grassroots activism with people living with HIV/AIDS in Southwestern Uganda, we are glad to be working with the Barefoot Grannies in Northeastern Uganda to transform communities. Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) is recognized
internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women. In some
cases, girls bleed to death or die from infections. Later in life, FGM can lead
to complications in childbirth and increase the risk of the mother and/or baby
dying. The practice also violates women's rights to health, security and
physical integrity, the right to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment, and the right to life when the procedure results in death.


It’s our duty to protect and observe women rights,
end the social, cultural and political causes of Female Genital Mutilation and
promote women’s reproductive rights. BAREFOOT GRANNIES ARE
LEADING EFFORTS TO END FGM AND PROMOTE WOMEN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH, PLEASE JOIN AND SUPPORT THEM TO CHANGE THEIR
COMMUNITIES.

I am 29 years old and live in Winnipeg, Canada. In September 2012 I was bit by a deer tick and started feeling sick. I immediately went to my doctor and asked to be tested for Lyme disease and West Nile. Both tests came back negative and I was sent on my way with no treatment or referrals. <br/></p><p>After that, I was in my doctors office weekly with new symptoms and quickly diminishing energy levels. Within the first month and a half of getting the bite I had most of the symptoms of Lyme and was barely able to make it through the day without assistance from my parents and friends. I had to take a break from school and was unable to keep up at work. I was not being taken seriously by medical professionals and was written off time and time again.</p><p> In February 2013 I brought my concerns that it might be Lyme forward to my Naturopath in Winnipeg and he immediately sent my blood away to a specialty lab in California. Three weeks later in early March, 2013, I was diagnosed with what I suspected it was all along, Lyme. Although the diagnosis was something that I needed to move forward with treatment, it was not the news I wanted to hear. <br/></p><p>Not may people are aware that getting treated for Lyme Disease by an MD in Canada is next to impossible. Unfortunately, this is the reality for many people who are in the same boat as me, fighting for treatment. I decided that my health is much more important than money and that I would pay for treatment as long as I could do so. </p><p>I currently get naturopathic treatment both in Winnipeg, Manitoba and in Calgary, Alberta. Naturopathic doctors are only allowed to prescribe anti-biotics if they are certified in British Columbia. My naturopathic doctor in Calgary is certified in B.C., therefore has the ability to provide me with access to anti-biotic treatment. Dr. Aparna Taylor is a member of the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Sociey (ILADS) and has dedicated much of her practice to treating tick borne illnesses such as Lyme. I am very fortunate to have her as part of my healthcare team and am hopeful that she will be able to help my get better. The only barrier left standing before me is the financial burden of treatment costs. The main goal of this campaign is to be financially able to continue seeing her and receiving treatment. I ran out of anti-biotics this past week and will not be able to get more until I can afford to go to Calgary and be reassessed. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/507673/files/20140414111742-IMG_2280.jpg?1397499462"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p>Since May 2013 I have spent over $10,000 of savings and RRSPs in an attempt to rid my body of the disease but am still not Lyme free.

The mouthpiece is made of <b>antibacterial silicone</b> that <b>kills 99.99% of all bacteria</b> and features 3D-arranged <b>bristles on</b> <b>both sides</b> to clean your teeth. It’s <b>soft enough to prevent gum damage</b> but strong enough to clean your teeth precisely. It can be <b>cleansed by normal rinsing</b>, as you would do it with regular toothbrushes.</p><h3><b>Brushing Technique</b></h3><p>The bristles are directed in a <b>45° angle against your gingival cuff</b>. This <b>simulates the Bass method</b>, which is <b>recommended by dentists</b> and experts. The bristles are <b>comparable to soft-bristled toothbrushes</b>. This ensures the <b>most comfortable, safest toothbrushing</b> and makes gum-damage impossible. We <b>work closely</b> with <b>dentists and dental universities</b> to address two concerns: <b>clean teeth and no gum damage</b>.</p><h3>Single Size</h3><p>We <b>analyzed</b> over <b>2,000 different jaws</b> from adult <b>females and males</b>. The <b>small difference</b> between both genders is <b>smoothed out</b> by the <b>flexible material</b> of the mouthpiece. The used <b>material</b> has the characteristic to <b>fit every jaw</b> with no abnormal teeth displacements.</p><h3><b>Replacement</b></h3><p>As with regular manual toothbrushes and electric toothbrush heads, the mouthpiece should be replaced every 3-6 months. Many studies prove that used bristles are not as effective in terms of plaque removal, as new ones. A single mouthpiece will cost €6.</p><div data-id=""17234319""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1501017678/gmkbkslyai6qcsy0qag1.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><div data-id=""17234661""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1501017679/eswioo9mvs6kvdgzq48g.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><h3> </h3><h3><b>Electronics</b></h3><p>The handpiece <b>contains</b> all of the <b>complex technology</b>. It creates <b>strong vibrations</b> with an amplitude of 9.5G to <b>oscillate the bristles</b> and clean your teeth. A <b>clever algorithm</b> ensures the generation of <b>different vibrations</b>. This results in a <b>coordinated movement of the bristles</b>, which are designed to have <b>different resonant frequencies</b>.</p><h3>10 Seconds</h3><p><b>Amabrush</b> can <b>brush</b> your teeth <b>in just 10 seconds</b>, because <b>all your teeth</b> are <b>cleaned simultaneously</b>. Even in this 10 seconds, <b>every</b> tooth <b>surface</b> is <b>cleaned longer</b> compared with common toothbrushes. If you brush your teeth for the recommended 120 seconds with a regular toothbrush (manual or electric), every surface gets brushed for just 1.25 seconds (given the fact that you have 32 teeth and every teeth has three surfaces). Amabrush brushes all your surfaces for whole 10 seconds. <b>This means: every tooth surface gets brushed 8x longer <i>and</i> the total toothbrushing duration is 12x quicker.</b></p><h3><b>Pump, Battery &amp; Charging</b></h3><p>A <b>built-in mechanism</b> foams and delivers the <b>right amount of toothpaste</b> to your teeth, and the <b>integrated battery lasts for 28 sessions</b> of toothbrushing. So if you go on vacation without the charging station, you can brush your teeth for <b>at least two weeks twice a day</b>.</p><p>The handpiece also comprises a <b>low-energy wireless charging module (Qi)</b>. So yes, you could even use your wireless smartphone charger to charge Amabrush.</p><h3><b>Sharing</b></h3><p>A <b>magnetic connection</b> on the handpiece gives you the opportunity to <b>use Amabrush with different people</b>. Simply put the <b>mouthpiece near</b> the <b>handpiece</b>, and the strong <b>magnet</b> will <b>automatically</b> do the rest for you. We were told that <b>""it really works like magic,""</b> and we think the same.</p><p><b>Notice:</b> if you want to <b>share Amabrush with different people, you just need a single handpiece!</b> Everyone needs their own mouthpiece, but you don't have to get a separate handpiece for every person!</p><div data-id=""17234347""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1501017680/dkixhxu90pzsmymlre8r.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><div data-id=""17234484""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1501017680/zj13hpqs7v9fkg1rfmui.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><h3> </h3><h3><b>Replacement &amp; Varieties</b></h3><p>The toothpaste capsules are simply placed into the handpiece, automatically providing the <b>perfect amount</b> of toothpaste each time you brush your teeth.

Amabrush is the world's first, fully automatic toothbrush. This patent pending device brushes all your teeth at once, fully automatic, and finishes in just ten seconds. All you have to do is press a single button, wait ten seconds, and you’ll have perfectly clean teeth!
AMABRUSH is not being offered for sale until a commercialized design is finalized and manufactured.Due to high demand, estimated shipping will be no longer February 2018. More and specific information about ETA will follow in January 2018! Thank you for understanding and for your patience.Let's face it: brushing your teeth is not exactly the sexiest thing on Earth. You have to squeeze, scrub, gargle, spit, rinse and floss every morning and evening, every day of your life. Many of us hate brushing our teeth so much that we avoid doing so whenever possible—even though we know we shouldn’t... Brushing our teeth at least twice a day maintains good dental health. This is why we invented Amabrush—a device three years in the making with a single goal: to make toothbrushing quicker, automatic, and more efficient so you have more time for the relevant things in your life.

 

Amabrush with Wireless Charging Station (included in Amabrush Pro packages)
USB-C instead of micro-USB! We got this request really often, and we too think that this is a great way to build Amabrush with top-notch technology right from the beginning. Many of you demanded such an upgrade, and your request is our command!
Furthermore, we will offer a lid with integrated UV light as an add-on. This protects the mouthpieces of Amabrush from dust and other environmental influences, and sanitizes the mouthpieces with UV light. This is able to store and sanitize two mouthpieces. This is an accessory for the mouthpiece-storage-attachment (that comes included in the pro version). It features a door with a hinge, a mirrored interior panelling in order to get the most out of the UV lamp, and is a great addition in order to keep Amabrush hygienic and clean. You can add the add-ons to your order after the campaign ends.
Choose between various different add-ons. The images above shown are for illustration purpose only! We'll offer a traveller case in order to store your Amabrush conveniently and hygienic when you are on vacation. Furthermore, our charging station will be modular. That means, if you use Amabrush on your own, you can simply detach the mouthpiece slots that are designed to store additional mouthpieces. All pro versions come with a charging station and two slots included. What's more, we will offer a tongue cleaner made out of the same antibacterial material, in order to keep your tongue smooth and clean. You can find additional details and choose these items after the campaign ends.
Your request is our command! We will integrate Bluetooth to all of our rewards at no additional cost. With our Amabrush App for iOS & Android, you are able to connect to your Amabrush unit and make use of various possibilities. You can set different vibration modes (gum massage, whitening, burst mode, ...), configure cleaning time, reorder replacement parts and do many things more!Amabrush is made out of three parts:
The Mouthpiece
The Handpiece
The Toothpaste Capsules
 Antibacterial MaterialThe flexible mouthpiece has built-in micro-channels that transport the toothpaste to your teeth. The mouthpiece is made of antibacterial silicone that kills 99.99% of all bacteria and features 3D-arranged bristles on both sides to clean your teeth. It’s soft enough to prevent gum damage but strong enough to clean your teeth precisely. It can be cleansed by normal rinsing, as you would do it with regular toothbrushes.Brushing TechniqueThe bristles are directed in a 45° angle against your gingival cuff. This simulates the Bass method, which is recommended by dentists and experts. The bristles are comparable to soft-bristled toothbrushes. This ensures the most comfortable, safest toothbrushing and makes gum-damage impossible. We work closely with dentists and dental universities to address two concerns: clean teeth and no gum damage.Single SizeWe analyzed over 2,000 different jaws from adult females and males. The small difference between both genders is smoothed out by the flexible material of the mouthpiece. The used material has the characteristic to fit every jaw with no abnormal teeth displacements.ReplacementAs with regular manual toothbrushes and electric toothbrush heads, the mouthpiece should be replaced every 3-6 months. Many studies prove that used bristles are not as effective in terms of plaque removal, as new ones. A single mouthpiece will cost €6.  ElectronicsThe handpiece contains all of the complex technology. It creates strong vibrations with an amplitude of 9.5G to oscillate the bristles and clean your teeth. A clever algorithm ensures the generation of different vibrations. This results in a coordinated movement of the bristles, which are designed to have different resonant frequencies.10 SecondsAmabrush can brush your teeth in just 10 seconds, because all your teeth are cleaned simultaneously. Even in this 10 seconds, every tooth surface is cleaned longer compared with common toothbrushes. If you brush your teeth for the recommended 120 seconds with a regular toothbrush (manual or electric), every surface gets brushed for just 1.25 seconds (given the fact that you have 32 teeth and every teeth has three surfaces). Amabrush brushes all your surfaces for whole 10 seconds. This means: every tooth surface gets brushed 8x longer and the total toothbrushing duration is 12x quicker.Pump, Battery & ChargingA built-in mechanism foams and delivers the right amount of toothpaste to your teeth, and the integrated battery lasts for 28 sessions of toothbrushing. So if you go on vacation without the charging station, you can brush your teeth for at least two weeks twice a day.The handpiece also comprises a low-energy wireless charging module (Qi). So yes, you could even use your wireless smartphone charger to charge Amabrush.SharingA magnetic connection on the handpiece gives you the opportunity to use Amabrush with different people. Simply put the mouthpiece near the handpiece, and the strong magnet will automatically do the rest for you. We were told that ""it really works like magic,"" and we think the same.Notice: if you want to share Amabrush with different people, you just need a single handpiece! Everyone needs their own mouthpiece, but you don't have to get a separate handpiece for every person!  Replacement & VarietiesThe toothpaste capsules are simply placed into the handpiece, automatically providing the perfect amount of toothpaste each time you brush your teeth. A single capsule lasts for more than a month, costs €3 and is available in three different, FDA-approved varieties: Extra Fresh (blue), Whitening (white) and Sensitive (rose - without fluoride). The toothpaste is specially formulated as it needs to be more liquid than regular ones.You can also use your own toothpaste with Amabrush, by simply refill our refillable toothpaste capsules, or by applying it directly to the mouthpiece.ManufacturingThe toothpaste is formulated and produced by a major toothpaste manufacturer with a history of over 100 years. This manufacturer fulfills the quality norm DIN EN ISO 13485 and the requirements of IFS Household and Personal Care Products, and was one of the first manufacturers in Europe retrieving the IFS-HPC certificate.  Amabrush is not meant to be better than your regular toothbrush.

<div>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;""><font color=""#000000"">Andrew and I have gone back and forth discussing if it was a ""good idea"" to post this information online and let the world into this personal and difficult journey we've been on. There are pros and cons that always come up. For starters, there is not a guarantee. This procedure might not work. In addition, many people in our lives will be shocked to hear this has been going on for five years. We hope this will not change the way they treat us and that they will feel comfortable talking about this with us. We must prepare ourselves for the questions and comments that will come, many of which we have dodged by facing these difficulties with only a few close friends, coworkers and family members. All that to say, we can NOT do this without you. The deeper we get into this, the harder it is to pretend like life is great. If we say no to dinner invites to save money, we want you to know why we are saving money. If my attitude is awful and I look sleep deprived, I want you to know it's the side effects of my hormones running rampant. However, after much thought and prayer, we know the pros outweigh the cons. Sharing our story with you, could result in two things. With your help, we could become pregnant and have a baby! That thought in itself is so exciting for us. We could have a child! :) And secondly, if there are any couples reading this that are facing the challenges of infertility, we hope this gives them the courage to speak up, to reach out, to fight! Overall, this is a scary thing for us to admit and if there are others dealing with this too, we'd love to hear from you! </font></span></p>

</div></div>","Our Story
My husband and I began dating when we were 16. Now, ten years later, he is still my best friend and hopefully soon to be the father of our children. That is, if one day, we can have them.

 
Three months before we were married my gynecologist found multiple large fibroids in my uterus. Combined, they made my uterus the size of a five-month pregnancy.  I needed surgery to remove them, and soon.   Weeks later I was sitting in the office of a Fertility Specialist talking about my only option for surgery: a myomectomy (the removal of fibroids through an incision in my abdomen).

 
Here we are, five years and three myomectomies later, with nearly 100 fibroids removed.  I have had mulitiple procedures, a pregnancy, a miscarriage, numerous ultrasounds, visits to specialists, and blood transfusions.  I am now left with two blocked fallopian tubes and invitro fertilization (IVF) as our only option to have a baby.  

 
This is our last chance. The fertility specialist said there will be no more myomectomies, because of too much scar tissue and the blood loss from my most recent surgery last July was tremendous.  
 
We need to have IVF as soon as we can because a hysterectomy is the only way to stop the fibroids that will be too large to endure before next year is over.

 
Weâ€™ve been through so many other things in the last five years, that we havenâ€™t been able to save much money for IVF.  Between starting our lives together as a newly married couple, buying our first home, working, and my fertility problems, the expenses have been great. 


3 Myomectomies

2 HSGâ€™s

Multiple Prescriptions

Specialists visits

3 different 6 week recovery periods

Too many ultrasounds to count
All of this has made the process of saving for IVF extremely difficult.




 
We know that IVF is expensive for everyone. But, we donâ€™t have the option to wait until weâ€™re older, especially with a hysterectomy right around the corner.  In order to save the $16,000 that it requires to have IVF treatments, and hold on to the one opportunity we have for having a child naturally, we are now seeking help.

 
I know for some who will read this it may be a lot to swallow.  But take heart that even though  month after month our lives are filled with defeat, we are not giving up!  Through it all we have and will remain hopeful that, someday, we will have the family we want. We know we are meant to be parents, and when that day comes, all of this will be worth it! With the help of an amazing group of doctors, the support of our awesome family and friends, and strength from God, we believe we will  have a baby!  We are choosing not to let the lack of expenses hold us back.  We are inviting all of our Family, Friends, and anyone who feels led to support us to become a part of our ""Baby Welborn Journey""!
 
The Impact


Andrew and I have gone back and forth discussing if it was a ""good idea"" to post this information online and let the world into this personal and difficult journey we've been on. There are pros and cons that always come up. For starters, there is not a guarantee. This procedure might not work. In addition, many people in our lives will be shocked to hear this has been going on for five years. We hope this will not change the way they treat us and that they will feel comfortable talking about this with us. We must prepare ourselves for the questions and comments that will come, many of which we have dodged by facing these difficulties with only a few close friends, coworkers and family members. All that to say, we can NOT do this without you. The deeper we get into this, the harder it is to pretend like life is great. If we say no to dinner invites to save money, we want you to know why we are saving money. If my attitude is awful and I look sleep deprived, I want you to know it's the side effects of my hormones running rampant. However, after much thought and prayer, we know the pros outweigh the cons. Sharing our story with you, could result in two things. With your help, we could become pregnant and have a baby! That thought in itself is so exciting for us. We could have a child! :) And secondly, if there are any couples reading this that are facing the challenges of infertility, we hope this gives them the courage to speak up, to reach out, to fight!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! Welcome to our quest to Mend Mindy's Migraines! Mindy McCartney is a good friend of mine from high school who is a NICU nurse in Albuqerque, New Mexico. She has struggled with a brain tumor and other neurological problems since her second year of college in 1998. She lives in constant pain due to extreme chronic migraines, but we finally see a light at the end of this tunnel! The light is provided by a doctor specializing in chronic migraines; unfortunately, Mindy lives in Albuquerque, and the doctor is in Denver. This campign is raising money to help Mindy and her husband travel to Denver to get the care she needs to live a full, normal life. </p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><b>$1200 for the initial evaluation in Denver, CO</b>. This includes:</p>
<p>$177 for blood work, $475 for a 2.5 hour complete physical, $175 for a 1.5 hour explanation of findings, $169 for special tailored vitamin/mineral supplements, $165 for two 30 minute sessions with a nutritionist.</p>
<p>Travel/lodging to Denver</p>
<p>Follow up care including medications, treatments ($70) and phone consultations ($150).  A doctor here in Albuquerque will coordinate care with the doctor in Denver, but the initial consultation and some follow up visits must take place in Denver.</p>
<p>ANYONE who donates will get a handwritten thank you note from Mindy.</p>
<p><b>THE IMPACT</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Mindy was diagnosed with a cavernous hemangioma (blood vessel tumor) in 1998. She has been through 15 surgeries, including removal of the hemangioma (1.5 cm of the hemangioma still remains), insertion and calibration of a lumbar-peritoneal shunt and insertion and calibration of a ventral-peritoneal shunt. The changes in cranial pressure cause her to see double occasionally. She has seen too many neurologists and neurosurgeons to count over the last 15 years.  At this point Mindy's neurologist and neurosurgeon have tested everything they can think of and have basically told Mindy she will have to live with the unbearable pain of the headaches for the rest of her life. Someone, hopefully the doctor in Denver, will be able to offer Mindy hope. Telling a young woman she has ""to live with this"" is just not acceptable. </p>
<p>Throughout all of this Mindy graduated from Trinity University with a BS in Biology and Psychology in December of 2002. She got her BS in Nursing from the University of Colorado Health Sciences in 2006. She became a registered NICU nurse in February of 2007 (Mindy had worked as a technician in the NICU since 2003).</p>
<i> Mindy is an amazing NICU nurse. She is the one who monitors the premature newborns day and night to make sure they get the medications and care they need. Most importantly, Mindy spends quality time with the nervous parents to explain what is happening to their precious children and comfort the parents and newborns. She cannot give 100% of herself to the patients and parents because of the excruciating pain in her head. Mending Mindy's migraines will not only affect her life and the life of her husband, family and friends, it will also affect the lives of everyone who must spend time in her NICU.  </i><p></p>
<p>Right now Mindy can only work 2 days in a row. She gets 2-3 days off in between 2 day work shifts, and this is not enough time for her mind and body to recover. This has impacted her time with her husband, family and friends.  With no time to relax she can not find any time for herself. She can't ride her bike or go to the gym because overexerting herself leads to a tremendous increase in pain. Bending over also makes the migraines worse, which makes simple tasks such as doing laundry and feeding her 2 dogs and 2 cats a lesson in pain.  We must mend Mindy's migraines so she can regain the carefree spirit I remember from our high school years!</p>

<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"">Have you ever sat at your computer pulling your hair out after reading about your favourite team's latest decision making? We know you have... everybody does. This is what makes sport great. </span><br/>
</h3>
<p>We also know that the thought ""I could do better"" has also crossed your mind.</p>
<p>Here is your chance to have a genuine say in the start up and running of Birmingham's (UK) newest sports team. You get control and you take the glory when you win.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why Birmingham?</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/67230/files/20130911010928-brum.png?1378886968"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Quite simple. Birmingham is crying out for a sports team that will compete at the top of it's sport. For a city of 1 million, the demand for sport is high, and the chance to get behind and follow the rise of this sports team will get the city excited.</p>
<p>The city has only Aston Villa F.C., Warwickshire Cricket Club and the brand new Birmingham Knights basketball team playing in the top division of their sport. There is a huge gap to fill with a brand new sports team that will bring with it a huge buzz.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What do I get?</h3>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/67240/files/20130911013104-table.png?1378888264"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>The chance to get involved with the decision making of the club ( and other perks). Your vote's will define the club and help make it a success or failure.</p>
<p>You will be getting involved with voting on serious decisions, so important in fact that the first decision you will be voting on is which sport our team will play. </p>
<p>Further votes will include team names, colours, logos, uniform designs, mascots, ticket prices, wage bills, stadiums plus much much more.<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> </span></p>
<p>You will get the chance to control the full start up of the team, plus the first season of operation.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why your help is so important to us.</h3>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/67277/files/20130911015936-fan.png?1378889976"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<p>Sport isn't cheap if you want to be a success, but with the right sport, organised and run in the correct way, success really can be achieved.</p>
<p>Your help will genuinely be the difference. Starting with the money to provide the means to play, and secondly through your decisions the club will start its journey to the top. </p>
<p>For as little as £25 your can positively influence a city of 1 million people. You can bring joy to the citizens who are starved of sporting glory.  </p>

<p>Lets be champs together!!</p></span></span></div>","Have you ever sat at your computer pulling your hair out after reading about your favourite team's latest decision making? We know you have... everybody does. This is what makes sport great. 

We also know that the thought ""I could do better"" has also crossed your mind.
Here is your chance to have a genuine say in the start up and running of Birmingham's (UK) newest sports team. You get control and you take the glory when you win.


Why Birmingham?

Quite simple. Birmingham is crying out for a sports team that will compete at the top of it's sport. For a city of 1 million, the demand for sport is high, and the chance to get behind and follow the rise of this sports team will get the city excited.
The city has only Aston Villa F.C., Warwickshire Cricket Club and the brand new Birmingham Knights basketball team playing in the top division of their sport. There is a huge gap to fill with a brand new sports team that will bring with it a huge buzz.


What do I get?



The chance to get involved with the decision making of the club ( and other perks). Your vote's will define the club and help make it a success or failure.
You will be getting involved with voting on serious decisions, so important in fact that the first decision you will be voting on is which sport our team will play. 
Further votes will include team names, colours, logos, uniform designs, mascots, ticket prices, wage bills, stadiums plus much much more. 
You will get the chance to control the full start up of the team, plus the first season of operation.

Why your help is so important to us.

Sport isn't cheap if you want to be a success, but with the right sport, organised and run in the correct way, success really can be achieved.
Your help will genuinely be the difference. Starting with the money to provide the means to play, and secondly through your decisions the club will start its journey to the top. 
For as little as £25 your can positively influence a city of 1 million people. You can bring joy to the citizens who are starved of sporting glory.

<p>Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects millions of
people throughout the world. In Niger, 25% of the population or 4 million
people are affected by the Sickle Cell Disease. It is a chronic hereditary
blood disease, occurring primarily among Africans or persons of African
descent. It is characterized primarily by chronic anemia and periodic episodes
of pain, enlarged spleen, lethargy, weakness, joint pain, and blood clot
formation, etc… Almost all people with sickle cell anemia have painful episodes
called crises. These can last from hours to days. Crises can cause pain in the
lower back, leg, joints, and chest. Some people have one episode every few
years. Others have many episodes each year. The crises can be severe enough to
require a hospital stay. People with sickle cell disease need ongoing
treatment, even when not having a crisis. </p>
<p>One of the major problems that health centers
in Niger are encountering is the lack of sufficient medical supplies and

children. This project will help equip and supply the health centers as well as
provide pain relievers free of charge to patients. One of the crucial elements
of this project is to provide the hospital with oxygen tanks along other

<p>This project is about financing the shipment
of medical equipment and supplies to hospitals and health centers in Niger. As

were granted a donation of two 40 foot containers from World Medical Relief,

approximately $900,000.The equipment and supplies will be allocated to the National

<p>                                                                                                                                           My name is Ingrid Pfeiffer.  I will be 64 yrs. old on July 29th 2012. The picture you see was taken after I lost all my hair and just before I realized I was in a financial disaster caused by a bad Insurance Company.</p>
<p>I had been working and the Insurance offered at work was high. Since I was very healthy and my income was modest, I decided to go through a less known Company, with a higher deductible and lower monthly premium. Now, six months into chemo, tired and on social security income of 1700/mo, wiped out of all my savings, since I can't work, I find myself in debt for over 100k.</p>
<p>My cancer is responding to the treatments and I am very grateful to God for that, but what will happen to me after I am in remission?</p>
<p>I cannot be approved for Medicare/Medicaid because I have a home and a couple of rentals. And although none of my Real Estate can be sold for any profit, given the Real Estate Market, here in MD, being a multiple property owner I cannot qualify!! for Medicare/Medicaid. I would have to file Bankruptcy and then, if I had less the 2500 dollars in the bank...they may consider me...I have tried everything! There is no way I could make 100K even if I sold everything I worked for, for 48 yrs, since I was 16…</p>
<p>There is something wrong with these rules and I would like someone to take action on it, because I am sure I am not the only person in America in this situation!!</p>
<p>I have Peritoneal Carcinoma. I am trying to raise money to pay for my cancer treatments, AND raise awareness of this rare cancer, Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma, very similar to Ovarian, but spread on the peritoneal lining.</p>
<p>But I also would like someone to realize how silly some of the requirements for Medicare/Medicaid are!!                                                                                        Or if there is someone out there that knows a solution, other than donations, I would love to get their help. I am not proud!!! Each Chemo session is almost 20k!! I get one every 3 wks.</p>
<p>I want people to be aware that this Cancer has no Symptoms, other than being tired. During an emergency surgery due to a strangulated Hernia the surgeon saw spots in my peritoneal lining and if it hadn't been for the hernia, right now I could be dead...So I consider that a miracle! I had just tiredness, and minor pains in the abdomen, which of course I attributed to the hernia.</p>
<p>To top it all because I had a previous hernia, in a different location, the insurance I have, refuses to pay for all the cancer testing and prolonged stay in the hospital because I was taken to the hospital due to a hernia. And they refuse to pay my chemo because one of their clauses written in ""fine letters"" in the contract, requires hospitalization overnight to pay for chemo. No one stays overnight for chemo!! And they pay a maximum of 1000 for testing!!</p>
<p>Just one PET scan is 4k!!</p>
<p>I know..I know.. I didn't read all the fine writing!!! I know it's my fault for going cheaper, but this is a huge company, a division of a HUGE LIFE INS. CO. based in NY, so I trusted them..

<p>Drie jaar geleden ben ik afgestudeerd aan de Arnhemse
toneelschool. Ik verheugde me op een spannende tijd waarin ik veel projecten
kon aannemen maar slechts vier maanden later werd er bij mij colitis ulcerosa
vastgesteld. Er is geen geneesmiddel voor deze ziekte en van dokters kreeg ik
te horen dat het vanaf nu per jaar slechter zou gaan. Ik zou veel tijd moeten
doorbrengen bij het toilet.</p><p>Waarom een transplantatie?</p>
<p>Laat ik eerst uitleggen wat deze transplantatie inhoudt. De
officiele term hiervoor is FMT (fecal microbiotic transplantation) oftewel
poeptransfusie in de volksmond. Wat doet het dat normale medicijnen niet doen?
Het reset je darmflora en herstelt schade dat is aangericht door een
ongebalanceerde darmflora, zoals ik heb. En hopelijk zal het in mijn geval me
ook van de medicijnen af helpen zodat ik eindelijk weer kan aansterken in
plaats van af takelen.</p>
<p>De afgelopen drie jaar is het moeilijk geweest om te voelen
hoe mijn lichaam langzaam achteruit ging. Ik heb een dieet kunnen vinden
waarmee ik er tegen heb kunnen vechten door het weglaten van alle granen,
rijst, aardappels, suikers, melk, soja etc. Ik kan me niet eens meer herinneren
wanneer ik mijn laatste pizza heb gegeten. Helaas heb ik niet altijd controle
over wat ik eet en soms krijg ik toch iets binnen wat mijn darmen niet aan
kunnen. En daar word ik moe van. Vooral wanneer het lijstje met eten wat je mag
alleen maar korter wordt.</p>
<p>Deze behandeling zal hopelijk mijn darmflora herstellen. Het
kan betekenen dat ik nooit meer medicijnen hoef te slikken en dat ik van mijn
dieet af kan (gedeeltelijk). Niet meer bang zijn om te eten. GEWOON TE ETEN. Op
sociaal vlak me weer op mijn gemak ga voelen. Kan werken en gewoon weer kan
leven zoals voor de diagnose. Het is moeilijk om thuis te zitten vanwege een
ziekte. En dit is een kans waarmee ik de kern van het probleem kan aanpakken.
Die moet ik pakken!</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>
<p></p><h3>WAT IK NODIG HEB.</h3><p></p>
<p>Voor deze behandeling en reis heb ik €8300.- nodig</p>
<p>Waar gaat het geld naartoe?</p>
<p>De FMT kost £4000.-. Omgerekend is dat €4900.-. Dat zijn de
kosten voor tien behandelingen over twee weken bij de Taymount kliniek in
Engeland. Ze vragen een extra £1000.- omdat ik geen ‘UK resident’ ben. In
totaal zal ik €6200.- nodig hebben voor de behandeling.</p>
<p>Omdat de behandeling is Engeland is zal ik nog een extra
€2100.- nodig hebben voor reis en verblijfkosten voor een periode van twee
weken. Een hotel kost daar rond de €55.- per nacht X 14 is €775.-. Vliegtickets
zullen maximaal €400.- kosten. Het eten zal ongeveer rond de €40.- per dag zijn
(vanwege het Paleo/SCD-dieet dat ik volg), €560 voor 14 dagen.  Alles bij elkaar €1735.-</p>
<p>Waarom dan de rest van het geld?</p>
<p>Er bestaat een kans dat er meer infusies moeten worden
gedaan dan gepland. Omdat dat onzeker is zal ik niet om meer vragen maar zal ik
wel een kleine buffer hebben voor onvoorziene kosten.</p>
<p></p><h3><br/></h3><h3><br/></h3><h3>DE IMPACT.</h3><p></p>
<p>Nog een reden waarom ik het belangrijk vindt om dit te
ondergaan is om andere mensen met colitis ulcerosa of andere vormen van darmproblemen
dat er meerdere therapieën zijn. Therapieen die werken, zelfs als ze nog niet
goed gekeurd zijn door de medische wetenschappen. Zodat mensen in ieder geval
weten dat ze opties hebben en niet alleen de medicijnen die de artsen volgens
protocol voor schrijven. Zodat ik hopelijk een nieuw succesverhaal kan
vertellen en bij kan dragen aan het behandelen van deze ziekte bij deze
behandelingen.  Ik zal elk persoon die ik
tegenkom met hetzelfde als ik aanmoedigen om dit te ondergaan. En hoop om een
voorbeeld te zijn van het goede resultaat.</p>
<p></p><h3><br/></h3><h3><br/></h3><h3>FMT, EEN UITDAGING.</h3><p></p>
<p>Het is niet makkelijk dit openbaar te doen. Het wordt ook niet makkelijk om de behandelingen te ondergaan. Er zit een zekere ‘yuck’ factor aan waar ik me overheen moet zetten aangezien het gewoon om ontlastingtransfusie gaat. Iemand anders zijn poep in je krijgen is niet bepaald een droom geweest voor mij. Maar ik ben bereid om die ‘yuck’ te weerstaan. Ik moet wel.</p><p>Zodra ik in
Hitchin kom zal ik een blog bijhouden. Waarin ik elke stap zal beschrijven van
de ervaring. Als mensen dit lezen en zien hoe ik het onderga, kan het misschien
voor hun de ‘yuck’factor weg nemen. Daarnaast denk ik dat het fijn is om niet
alleen te zijn als ik dit onderga.</p>
<p></p><h3><br/></h3><p><br/></p><h3>ANDERE MANIEREN OM TE HELPEN</h3><br/><p></p>
<p>Als je genoeg geld hebt dan zou ik je graag willen vragen om
een donatie. </p>
<p>Als je dit niet hebt maar wel veel vrienden zou ik je willen
vragen om dit bericht te sharen via FB, Twitter of email.</p>
<p>En mocht je genoeg geld én vrienden hebben dan graag allebei :-)</p>
<p>Als je mensen kent die hier ook aan lijden en die hulp nodig
hebben, voel je vrij om contact op te nemen. Ik weet veel over voeding en zal
graag mijn ervaringen en recepten delen.</p>

</p>
<p>Dankbaar voor wat ik krijg.</p><br/><p></p>
<p><b>(ENGLISH VERSION)</b><br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>A transplant. Why?</h3><p>Three years ago I graduated from the theatreschool in Arnhem. As I was picturing myself going from one project to the other after four months I was diagnosed with this cripling disease called Ulceritive Colitis, A INFLAMMABLE BOWEL DISEASE. There is no known cure for this disease and doctors told me to prepare for the regression my body will endure each year. I would see more of the toilet each year to come.</p><p>So why a transplant? </p><p>First step is calling it a fecal microbiotic transplantation. What does it do that normal medicine can't do? It re-populates my un-balanced gut flora and restores any damage that has been done and hopefully will rid me of the medicine. Throw me in remission and let my body start developing instead of declining. </p><p>It's been tough feeling my body decline so fast and get sick so easily. I have been able to fight the disease with a strict diet. I'm not eating grains, rice, potatoes, sugars, milk, soja etc. I can't even remember the last time I ate pizza. But in a world where we do not always have control on what is in our food, sometimes ingredients that are bad for me get through and I get sick. I am tired of it. Especially when the list with of food you can eat gets shorter over a period of time. </p><p>This FMT will restore my gut-flora hopefully. It may mean no more medicine and no more being sick. Not being scared to eat anymore. BEING ABLE TO EAT. Being able to engage socially. Work and just have a normal way of living. It's hard sitting home (chained to the toilet) because of your medical condition. This is a chance that can beat medicine and go to the root of the problem. <b>And I need to grab this oppurtunity!</b></p><h3>What I need.</h3><p>What I need for this treatment is €8300.-</p><p>Where does the money go?</p><p>The FMT itself costs £4000.- which is €4900.- when you calculate that. Thats the costs for ten treatments over a period of two weeks at the taymount clinic in the uk.  They charge another £1000.- for the treatment because I am no UK resident. So I will need €6200.- to cover medical bills.</p><p>Because the treatment is in the UK I need another €2100.- for travel, accomadation and food over a two week period of time. A regular hotel costs around 55 euro's a night. Making it 775 for 14 nights. Count in the flight tickets Max of €400.-.

Drie jaar geleden ben ik afgestudeerd aan de Arnhemse
toneelschool. Ik verheugde me op een spannende tijd waarin ik veel projecten
kon aannemen maar slechts vier maanden later werd er bij mij colitis ulcerosa
vastgesteld. Er is geen geneesmiddel voor deze ziekte en van dokters kreeg ik
te horen dat het vanaf nu per jaar slechter zou gaan. Ik zou veel tijd moeten
doorbrengen bij het toilet.Waarom een transplantatie?
Laat ik eerst uitleggen wat deze transplantatie inhoudt. De
officiele term hiervoor is FMT (fecal microbiotic transplantation) oftewel
poeptransfusie in de volksmond. Wat doet het dat normale medicijnen niet doen?
Het reset je darmflora en herstelt schade dat is aangericht door een
ongebalanceerde darmflora, zoals ik heb. En hopelijk zal het in mijn geval me
ook van de medicijnen af helpen zodat ik eindelijk weer kan aansterken in
plaats van af takelen.
De afgelopen drie jaar is het moeilijk geweest om te voelen
hoe mijn lichaam langzaam achteruit ging. Ik heb een dieet kunnen vinden
waarmee ik er tegen heb kunnen vechten door het weglaten van alle granen,
rijst, aardappels, suikers, melk, soja etc. Ik kan me niet eens meer herinneren
wanneer ik mijn laatste pizza heb gegeten. Helaas heb ik niet altijd controle
over wat ik eet en soms krijg ik toch iets binnen wat mijn darmen niet aan
kunnen. En daar word ik moe van. Vooral wanneer het lijstje met eten wat je mag
alleen maar korter wordt.
Deze behandeling zal hopelijk mijn darmflora herstellen. Het
kan betekenen dat ik nooit meer medicijnen hoef te slikken en dat ik van mijn
dieet af kan (gedeeltelijk). Niet meer bang zijn om te eten. GEWOON TE ETEN. Op
sociaal vlak me weer op mijn gemak ga voelen. Kan werken en gewoon weer kan
leven zoals voor de diagnose. Het is moeilijk om thuis te zitten vanwege een
ziekte. En dit is een kans waarmee ik de kern van het probleem kan aanpakken.
Die moet ik pakken!
WAT IK NODIG HEB.
Voor deze behandeling en reis heb ik €8300.- nodig
Waar gaat het geld naartoe?
De FMT kost £4000.-. Omgerekend is dat €4900.-. Dat zijn de
kosten voor tien behandelingen over twee weken bij de Taymount kliniek in
Engeland. Ze vragen een extra £1000.- omdat ik geen ‘UK resident’ ben. In
totaal zal ik €6200.- nodig hebben voor de behandeling.
Omdat de behandeling is Engeland is zal ik nog een extra
€2100.- nodig hebben voor reis en verblijfkosten voor een periode van twee
weken. Een hotel kost daar rond de €55.- per nacht X 14 is €775.-. Vliegtickets
zullen maximaal €400.- kosten. Het eten zal ongeveer rond de €40.- per dag zijn
(vanwege het Paleo/SCD-dieet dat ik volg), €560 voor 14 dagen.  Alles bij elkaar €1735.-
Waarom dan de rest van het geld?
Er bestaat een kans dat er meer infusies moeten worden
gedaan dan gepland. Omdat dat onzeker is zal ik niet om meer vragen maar zal ik
wel een kleine buffer hebben voor onvoorziene kosten.
DE IMPACT.
Nog een reden waarom ik het belangrijk vindt om dit te
ondergaan is om andere mensen met colitis ulcerosa of andere vormen van darmproblemen
dat er meerdere therapieën zijn. Therapieen die werken, zelfs als ze nog niet
goed gekeurd zijn door de medische wetenschappen. Zodat mensen in ieder geval
weten dat ze opties hebben en niet alleen de medicijnen die de artsen volgens
protocol voor schrijven. Zodat ik hopelijk een nieuw succesverhaal kan
vertellen en bij kan dragen aan het behandelen van deze ziekte bij deze
behandelingen.  Ik zal elk persoon die ik
tegenkom met hetzelfde als ik aanmoedigen om dit te ondergaan. En hoop om een
voorbeeld te zijn van het goede resultaat.
FMT, EEN UITDAGING.
Het is niet makkelijk dit openbaar te doen. Het wordt ook niet makkelijk om de behandelingen te ondergaan. Er zit een zekere ‘yuck’ factor aan waar ik me overheen moet zetten aangezien het gewoon om ontlastingtransfusie gaat. Iemand anders zijn poep in je krijgen is niet bepaald een droom geweest voor mij. Maar ik ben bereid om die ‘yuck’ te weerstaan. Ik moet wel.Zodra ik in
Hitchin kom zal ik een blog bijhouden. Waarin ik elke stap zal beschrijven van
de ervaring. Als mensen dit lezen en zien hoe ik het onderga, kan het misschien
voor hun de ‘yuck’factor weg nemen. Daarnaast denk ik dat het fijn is om niet
alleen te zijn als ik dit onderga.
ANDERE MANIEREN OM TE HELPEN
Als je genoeg geld hebt dan zou ik je graag willen vragen om
een donatie. 
Als je dit niet hebt maar wel veel vrienden zou ik je willen
vragen om dit bericht te sharen via FB, Twitter of email.
En mocht je genoeg geld én vrienden hebben dan graag allebei :-)
Als je mensen kent die hier ook aan lijden en die hulp nodig
hebben, voel je vrij om contact op te nemen. Ik weet veel over voeding en zal
graag mijn ervaringen en recepten delen.
HET EERSTE DOEL IS BEREIKT! 15 APRIL IS DE DAG! DANK IEDEREEN!HET TWEEDE DOEL IS OM BEREIKT! NU KAN IK DE BEHANDELING OOK ECHT ONDERGAAN! DERDE EN LAATSTE DOEL IS OM HET BEDRAG VOL TE KRIJGEN ZODAT IK ER OOK ECHT HEEN KAN!MOCHT ER MEER GELD BINNENKOMEN DAN DE 100% WAAR IK OM VRAAG DAN ZAL IK DAT GELD INVESTEREN IN EXTRA BEHANDELINGEN DIE BEVROREN MEE KUNNEN NAAR HUIS.
Zodra ik al het geld bij elkaar heb gehaald en de
behandeling ben ondergaan nodig iedereen uit om te komen naar mijn theatersolo!

Dankbaar voor wat ik krijg.
(ENGLISH VERSION)A transplant. Why?Three years ago I graduated from the theatreschool in Arnhem. As I was picturing myself going from one project to the other after four months I was diagnosed with this cripling disease called Ulceritive Colitis, A INFLAMMABLE BOWEL DISEASE. There is no known cure for this disease and doctors told me to prepare for the regression my body will endure each year. I would see more of the toilet each year to come.So why a transplant? First step is calling it a fecal microbiotic transplantation. What does it do that normal medicine can't do? It re-populates my un-balanced gut flora and restores any damage that has been done and hopefully will rid me of the medicine. Throw me in remission and let my body start developing instead of declining. It's been tough feeling my body decline so fast and get sick so easily. I have been able to fight the disease with a strict diet. I'm not eating grains, rice, potatoes, sugars, milk, soja etc. I can't even remember the last time I ate pizza. But in a world where we do not always have control on what is in our food, sometimes ingredients that are bad for me get through and I get sick. I am tired of it. Especially when the list with of food you can eat gets shorter over a period of time. This FMT will restore my gut-flora hopefully. It may mean no more medicine and no more being sick. Not being scared to eat anymore. BEING ABLE TO EAT. Being able to engage socially. Work and just have a normal way of living. It's hard sitting home (chained to the toilet) because of your medical condition. This is a chance that can beat medicine and go to the root of the problem. And I need to grab this oppurtunity!What I need.What I need for this treatment is €8300.-Where does the money go?The FMT itself costs £4000.- which is €4900.- when you calculate that. Thats the costs for ten treatments over a period of two weeks at the taymount clinic in the uk.  They charge another £1000.- for the treatment because I am no UK resident. So I will need €6200.- to cover medical bills.Because the treatment is in the UK I need another €2100.- for travel, accomadation and food over a two week period of time. A regular hotel costs around 55 euro's a night. Making it 775 for 14 nights. Count in the flight tickets Max of €400.-. And nutrition per day is about €40.- (cause of the paleodiet i'm following) times 14 makes it 560. Together summing up for 1735 euro's. So why do I need the rest of the money? There is a possibility that the treatment will take more infusions than planned. But because that is uncertain I wont ask for more but would like to have a small buffer so that I wont come in unforseen debts.The ImpactAnother reason why this is valuable is to show people who are suffering from Ulceritive Colitis or any other form of IBD that there are different sorts of treatments.

<p>All our ducks are in a row (..a very straight and well tested row), and now we just need support from backers to push this business into reality.</p>
<p>The risks we face are those that every business faces. For example, there is always a risk of hazardous shipping conditions from overseas. There also may be a risk of domestic shipping damage. Don't worry! If that happens, we'll replace any products that have been damaged during shipping. While we feel it is very minimal, there is always a risk of faulty electrical wiring.

</p><p>   I have made a career of starting companies that developed technological

devices, I've also started product development companies that developed consumer 
electronic products and I even started a toy company to sell a product 
that we developed called Klixx.</p><p>  Creating the Bite Zapper was a 
labor of love and necessity.  I get bitten often when mosquitoes are 
around and they leave itchy swelling bites that seem to last forever. 
Before Bite Zapper, I would scratch bites until they bled without even 
being aware that I was scratching, often leaving marks on my arms and 
legs for months.</p><p>    It took quite a while, trying different 
approaches to eliminating the itching and swelling associated with 
mosquito bites.  I first tried using ultrasonics which worked to a point
 but it didn't bring the swelling down and needed to be reused often on 
the same bite to temporarily stop the itching. </p><p>  I discovered 
that there are several different brands of heating devices that claim to
 eliminate mosquito bites but they hurt when using them and you had to 
leave them on the bite for a long time, along with the fact that they 
are quite large compared to the Bite Zapper.  There are some that use a 
piezo disk that seem to work for a short while and then your itching 
returns and it didn't do anything about the swelling.  </p><p>  So, 
after playing with the ultrasonic method for a while and at the same 
time reading about the physiological response our bodies have to 
mosquito bites and what the exact cause of the itching and swelling was,
 I came up with an idea that truly works.  It involves pulsing a voltage
 at the appropriate level and the appropriate frequency. It uses a 
relatively low voltage and very low current so it does not have to be 
approved by any government agency and is completely safe.  This approach
 shuts down your body's response to the bite (Histamine production) 
which quickly halts the itching and allows the swelling to disappear in a
 short period of time. </p><p>  I recommend using the Bite Zapper for 15
 seconds on a fresh mosquito bite. If you are bitten and don't use the 
Bite Zapper right away (within a couple of minutes) you might have to 
use the Bite Zapper for a longer period.  I suggest doing 15 seconds, 
removing the Bite Zapper for a couple of seconds and if it still itches 
do another 15 seconds you may have to do it several times to eliminate 
the itching.  </p><p>  The Bite Zapper, with all its electronics and a 
rechargeable lithium battery is the size of a tube of Chapstick, pull 
off the switch at one end of the tube and you will find it has a built 
in USB connector to recharge the battery.  Just plug it into a standard USB 
port either on a computer, a wall adapter with USB ports, a car with USB
 ports or any other place you find a USB port.  Let it charge ( LED's 
light up the Bite Zapper alternating red and green while charging and 
green when it is charged) and it is good for dozens and dozens of 
mosquito bites on a single charge and the battery should last for 
years.</p><p>I hope your intrigued enough with the thought of 
eliminating mosquito bite itching and swelling to support our Indiegogo project and look forward to helping you eliminate mosquito 
bite torture.</p><p>Here is a review I received form a trial run we did.</p><p>
Brittany Marquis: </p><p>THANK YOU!!! I took this on my recent 3 week 
fly-fishing adventure in Idaho and my god, I was able to keep my sanity 
as the bugs (and bites) were huge yet I was able to stay itch free!

around and they leave itchy swelling bites that seem to last forever. 
Before Bite Zapper, I would scratch bites until they bled without even 
being aware that I was scratching, often leaving marks on my arms and 
legs for months.    It took quite a while, trying different 
approaches to eliminating the itching and swelling associated with 
mosquito bites.  I first tried using ultrasonics which worked to a point
 but it didn't bring the swelling down and needed to be reused often on 
the same bite to temporarily stop the itching.   I discovered 
that there are several different brands of heating devices that claim to
 eliminate mosquito bites but they hurt when using them and you had to 
leave them on the bite for a long time, along with the fact that they 
are quite large compared to the Bite Zapper.  There are some that use a 
piezo disk that seem to work for a short while and then your itching 
returns and it didn't do anything about the swelling.    So, 
after playing with the ultrasonic method for a while and at the same 
time reading about the physiological response our bodies have to 
mosquito bites and what the exact cause of the itching and swelling was,
 I came up with an idea that truly works.  It involves pulsing a voltage
 at the appropriate level and the appropriate frequency. It uses a 
relatively low voltage and very low current so it does not have to be 
approved by any government agency and is completely safe.  This approach
 shuts down your body's response to the bite (Histamine production) 
which quickly halts the itching and allows the swelling to disappear in a
 short period of time.   I recommend using the Bite Zapper for 15
 seconds on a fresh mosquito bite. If you are bitten and don't use the 
Bite Zapper right away (within a couple of minutes) you might have to 
use the Bite Zapper for a longer period.  I suggest doing 15 seconds, 
removing the Bite Zapper for a couple of seconds and if it still itches 
do another 15 seconds you may have to do it several times to eliminate 
the itching.    The Bite Zapper, with all its electronics and a 
rechargeable lithium battery is the size of a tube of Chapstick, pull 
off the switch at one end of the tube and you will find it has a built 
in USB connector to recharge the battery.  Just plug it into a standard USB 
port either on a computer, a wall adapter with USB ports, a car with USB
 ports or any other place you find a USB port.  Let it charge ( LED's 
light up the Bite Zapper alternating red and green while charging and 
green when it is charged) and it is good for dozens and dozens of 
mosquito bites on a single charge and the battery should last for 
years.I hope your intrigued enough with the thought of 
eliminating mosquito bite itching and swelling to support our Indiegogo project and look forward to helping you eliminate mosquito 
bite torture.Here is a review I received form a trial run we did.
Brittany Marquis: THANK YOU!!! I took this on my recent 3 week 
fly-fishing adventure in Idaho and my god, I was able to keep my sanity 
as the bugs (and bites) were huge yet I was able to stay itch free!",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>Most conventional head massagers on the market do not simulate manual massage movements. They use vibration, airbag compression, micro-current and other ways. These allow them to sell at a lower price. From our market research, most consumers tend to stop using them after the first experience. These massagers either take up your hands, cover your eyes, or stimulate electricity shock in you. In short, the experience can be terrible and not up to the user’s satisfaction. However, LEROU Robot uses physical-mechanical transmission, allowing the mechanism to fully simulate finger massages that will bring you to a very relaxedstate without any side effects. We are sure that once you use it, you will keep using it again because of the comfort it provides. It is also suitable and safe for regular use.</div>

<div>We collaborate with one of the best manufacturers to create our motor. It is a customized motor made according to our company’s high standards through research and development. After three years of numerous researches, product testing and alterations, we have developed the powerful and precision gearmotor. Although our motor is only 26 grams, it could handle a mass of 1175 grams, which is 45 times heavier! And at the same time, the noise doesn’t increase or change. On the same terms, we are the one and only motor that could achieve this in the world. Of course, other motors are able to similar to our performance and quality, but they cost more than $200. But, our LEROU Robot needs two of these motors, and even though it is the reason why we’re expensive, we are launching it at an early bird price on Kickstarter for only $169.</div>

After crossing mountains and oceans, overcoming so many obstacles, I’m sure no one will disagree. it must be to live longer in health and beauty，Before conquering the world, we should take care of ourselves and live life exquisitely and with quality. – LEROUWhat do  “Geeky Gadgets“、“Outuro Prossimo”、”Robotic Gizmos” say about LEROU Burnt out from stress; feeling irritated and can’t calm down; having poor sleep quality or can’t sleep at night, eventually causing you to poor mental state then inefficient work the next day.  Introducing LEROU Robot, a personal head massager that would make you feel relax and comfortable without obstructing your work. When using it, you will truly feel as if someone is massaging your temples. It stimulates you to be sleepy, and ultimately improve your sleep quality. LEROU Robot will change the way you sleep and relax.  For those who don’t like crow’s feet , LEROU ROBOT is like a beautician’s fingertips that massages the corner of your eyes. Regular usage can prevent and eliminate the growth of crow's feet. Have a question?Instantly Makes You Feel Comfortable And RelaxationUsing LEROU Robot for massagesis easy and comfortable. It can provide you with immediate comfort and relaxation. It is as if a real masseuse is massaging and calming you down from being upset or negative.  Promote Sleep Quality LEROU  can reduce stress, relax and calm your mind.  It can even  improve blood circulation in different parts of the head, helping you to get better sleep . 

 

 
We took LEROU Robot to the streets and select random people to experience and hear what they have to say about LEROU Robot. Most people never see a massager that looked like LEROU Robot, and their first response was ""comfort""after trying it. 


 


 
There are no limitations of when or where you can use LEROU Robot, simply use it whenever you need to relax! You can use it at your workplace, in the cab or while waiting for an appointment. It is the portable personal massage robot you ever need.
 

 

 
LEROU Robot implements human massaging simulation technique. So, when you are using LEROU Robot, you will feel as if your masseur is massaging you. The best part? You just need to position LEROU Robot on your head, turn it on, and carry on with your own work. You don’t need to hold anything in place, just let your LEROU do the job for you.
 

 

 
Most conventional head massagers on the market do not simulate manual massage movements. They use vibration, airbag compression, micro-current and other ways. These allow them to sell at a lower price. From our market research, most consumers tend to stop using them after the first experience. These massagers either take up your hands, cover your eyes, or stimulate electricity shock in you. In short, the experience can be terrible and not up to the user’s satisfaction. However, LEROU Robot uses physical-mechanical transmission, allowing the mechanism to fully simulate finger massages that will bring you to a very relaxedstate without any side effects. We are sure that once you use it, you will keep using it again because of the comfort it provides. It is also suitable and safe for regular use.
 

 

 
We use an FDA approved material that is soft and comfortable to the skin,  it would not cause any discomfort or bruise to the skin even after long hours of massaging. Besides that, after turning on the massaging robot, it will automatically adjust to fit the angle of the head, and solve any problem of the massage being too soft or too hard.
 

 

 
The head ring is made from all sorts of high quality material, it is also adjustable and made of light material. There are fixed slots for every adjustment to fit almost every size of the head. It also prevents the massage robot from slipping. 
 

 
Finding the right head size isn’t the easiest. After hundreds of simulation and commissioning, we manage to adjust LEROU Robot head ring according to appropriate measurements of different head sizes. 
 

 

 
At only 350grams, the ergonomically fit massaging robot will be positioned firmly at the head, with the head ring close to the back part of the head. The  weight will be spread across the entire head ring, so you won’t feel the weight. 
 

 

 
After folding, LEROU Robot can fit into your bag so that you can bring it on anywhere with you, even on the plane. Because it is so light and easy to wear, you can use it at work, while reading a book, or while taking a stroll in a park.
 

 

 
It rotates automatically in one direction, rotating 10 laps forward and 30 laps back. It is recommended that Each massage session is 7 minutes.
 

 

According to measurements, the loudest noise LEROU Robot’s motor can produce is about 43~44db, which is still all right for human ears. The low noise and powerful motor will provide you ultimate comfort, so where it whenever you want.



 
We collaborate with one of the best manufacturers to create our motor. It is a customized motor made according to our company’s high standards through research and development. After three years of numerous researches, product testing and alterations, we have developed the powerful and precision gearmotor. Although our motor is only 26 grams, it could handle a mass of 1175 grams, which is 45 times heavier! And at the same time, the noise doesn’t increase or change. On the same terms, we are the one and only motor that could achieve this in the world. Of course, other motors are able to similar to our performance and quality, but they cost more than $200. But, our LEROU Robot needs two of these motors, and even though it is the reason why we’re expensive, we are launching it at an early bird price on Kickstarter for only $169.

 
When we run the performance and endurance tests, our no-load test rig runs, can run more than 60,000 minutes or 1,000 hours. When testing the machine on people's heads. It is able to run for more than 12,000 minutes or 200 hours. High-quality products is our eternal pursuit.


450mAh battery allows LEROU Robot to run for 3 hours straight, and if under the standby mode, it could last up to 10 hours. The massaging robot consumes less energy, and we highly recommend users to use it for 7minutes.
 
 

 

We use high quality pc+abs material for the shell of LEROU. There is a manganese steel ring inside the back ring of the product. We use steel ring to keep the massager robot clamping force stable and not shrink. The part close to the head will be made of protein like leather and sponge. 


LEROU is very simple and convenient to use, you can check the total working time of the massaging robot through the LED Display. Press the button for 3 secs to start or shut off the massaging robot.

APPEAL 4 – GAZA WAR 2014
#EMGAZA4
Disabled
& Malnutrition 
EMGAZA
appeals founded to help Gaza’s disabilities due to the ongoing Israeli blocked
and immense humanitarian situation. 
We started
our humanitarian activities in the last Israeli genocide to help those who are
in need and got affected directly (individuals & Non-profit Organizations)

Since then
we successfully delivered aids (Incontinence pads, Medicines, Medical equipment and
first aid kits) to many Local NGOs and hospitals scattered in the Gaza
strip. 
We've done 3
appeals with this purpose and here is what we have achieved so far:  

12 local NGOs involved.


+3000 disabled got a quick help


 3 hospitals got medicines and first
aid kits.


Check our
video reports of the previous appeals.
Our humor to
continue helping Disabilities won’t stop here, thus why we are starting the 4th
appeal since the needs are high and so many disabled are relying on our aids. 
#EMGAZA4 Goals
In this
appeal we have two goals to hit. 


Helping Gaza’s disabilities with Incontinence pads


Helping disabled who have
malnutrition, especially children with providing Multivitamins (Syrup &
Tablets).


Statistics –
Gaza strip 
Malnutrition

According to
the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, 10.7 %  of Gazan children aged under five are now
suffering stunted growth due to chronic malnutrition.  The main reasons are 


 Gaza Strip does not have sufficient
natural food resources.


 Gaza cannot grow the variety of fruit
and vegetables needed in order to  provide children a well-balanced diet.


 Gaza depends on food imports, but the
food table in the Gaza Strip is now severely deficient because of the siege and
closure.


Disabilities

According to
the definition that Handicap International and the World Health Organization
uses includes the functional, the capacity of people to perform daily tasks on
their own 10 to 15 % of Gaza’s population are in a disability situation. 
PLAN 


We've got a good database which
involves so many NGOs and hospitals which deal with such conditions, and we've
managed that our aid will be distributed to the dedicated individuals through
them.


We will buy the needed items from
Gaza & West Bank drug stores which will be delivered straight away to the
dedicated individuals.


EMGAZA Appeals's Strategy
-  BDS
We as a team
of EMGAZA adopt BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanction) philosophy by
boycotting the Israeli goods and buying instead made in Palestine products. We
did/do buy medicines from the Palestinian medical factories – West Bank. 
-  ECONOMY 
By buying
the Palestinian products (Medicines), 
we will refresh some drug store’s 
business as well as improve the Palestinian economy since its affected
by Israeli siege and International Aids. 
- INDEPENDENT
We as a team don’t follow or endorse any political party. We
believe in Palestine and all Palestinians. 
EMGAZA TEAM
We are a
group of Pharmacists based on the Gaza strip, have a high attitude for a
humanitarian work and we’re all working as volunteers. We enjoy helping our
people and satisfied to draw a smile on so many sad faces and light up their hope.

<p>When our son suffered a concussion, we did not understand
the nuances of the recovery process. While he was stretched out on the couch missing weeks of school, I questioned if I was doing the right things. With the help of our doctor, we eventually got him back to high school, but by the time he
graduated, he suffered two more sports related concussions. We quickly became
“the experts” and friends came to us seeking advice and guidance. There is a great deal of information about what is a concussion, its signs and symptoms, even its prevention, but few websites delve into the complexities of post concussion management.  We saw that recovery is dependent on parents, and parents need to be empowered with accurate
information to make the best decisions for their own child.</p>
<p>For the past 13 years, my husband and I have partnered together creating videos and developing websites. Recently, we have been specializing in patient and physician education and developed projects for Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital, and Brigham and Women’s Hospital. We know first hand the power of videos in providing effective communications and we want to share the stories from parents, children, trainers, athletes, school nurses, and other medical professionals. Stories that will bring clarity and comfort to families who may feel isolated and worried. Stories that will also provide them with answers to help guide their decisions.</p>

<p><b>Visit The Food Challenge Website</b></p>
<p>Dr. Wayne Shreffler, Director of the Food Allergy Center at MGH, wanted a way to show his patients what to expect at The Food Challenge. How do you take a five hour challenge, which is essentially patients sitting in a examining room waiting for an allergic reaction, and transform it into an interesting educational tool? We came up with the idea to interview parents and children before and after. What we discovered was that patients are passionate and eloquent, and could tell the story to other patients better than any narrated script could ever accomplish. We edited all the pieces into short videos based on pertinent topics. Then we built a website designed to be user friendly, allowing patients to easily find what they needed.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>There are three separate facets to <b>Connect2Concussion</b>: excellent
video, user-friendly website, and extensive networking to get the word out.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>1 Video Production.</b></p>
<p>We have to find interesting people willing to tell their stories, then capture their content and edit it with skill and finesse so the video is also compelling and meaningful to watch. The more funds we raise, the more we can travel and the more stories we can collect.</p>
<p><b>2 Develop and Maintain a Website.</b></p>
<p>We plan on not only developing a website, but organizing this amazing and powerful content so that it is easy to use and easy to find information.</p>
<p>We also want to create a portal that will allow other organizations to display our content on their own website. We are working closely with National Recreation and Parks Association (NRPA) to offer their 42,000 affiliate members this option.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>3 Get the word out</b></p>
<p>It makes no sense to build a website with great content if no one knows about it.<br/>
</p><p>Eli, our social media expert, is working daily connecting us to people on facebook and twitter.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are committed to networking to find similar organizations or youth sports teams to point them to our website or provide content to their own. We want to reach out to as many people and organizations as possible for either content or exposure.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Time and Expenses</b></p>
<p>We have the experience and the skill set to create high quality content and develop a significant platform for its delivery. All of the above requires a huge amount of time, professional expertise, and overhead.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>If we raise funds ABOVE the minimal ask...</b></p>
<p>We can maintain the website (and social media) by adding new content and keeping it fresh and up-to-date.</p>
<p>We can also add functionality. It would be great if people could upload their own videos. This would allow people from all over the country to share their stories.</p>
<p>We can also collect and maintain links to viable resources such as medical facilities, relevant websites and published books.</p><p><br/></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Before embarking on this endeavor, we met and spoke to many people. Parents who had experienced the difficulties surrounding recovery were excited to learn about this project. They know even under the best of circumstances, the tremendous amount of stress this injury places on a family. Having a place to go for support and encouragement can be significant to a everyone involved.</p>
<p>Medical professionals have also voiced enthusiasm towards our project. It would mean they could direct their patients to a website that would answer many of the their basic questions and common concerns, freeing up valuable time for their staff.</p><p><br/></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This project is low risk. We have a great deal of experience with video production and website development.

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Connect us to your friends, family, and colleagues. Everyone knows someone who has had a concussion. We are looking for people who would like to share their story. Most importantly, we need people to help us network with individuals and organizations. Help us get the word out so we can help families get their children safely back to school and back to play.</p>
</div></div>","Short Summary
When our son suffered a concussion, we did not understand
the nuances of the recovery process. While he was stretched out on the couch missing weeks of school, I questioned if I was doing the right things. With the help of our doctor, we eventually got him back to high school, but by the time he
graduated, he suffered two more sports related concussions. We quickly became
“the experts” and friends came to us seeking advice and guidance. There is a great deal of information about what is a concussion, its signs and symptoms, even its prevention, but few websites delve into the complexities of post concussion management.  We saw that recovery is dependent on parents, and parents need to be empowered with accurate
information to make the best decisions for their own child.
For the past 13 years, my husband and I have partnered together creating videos and developing websites. Recently, we have been specializing in patient and physician education and developed projects for Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital, and Brigham and Women’s Hospital. We know first hand the power of videos in providing effective communications and we want to share the stories from parents, children, trainers, athletes, school nurses, and other medical professionals. Stories that will bring clarity and comfort to families who may feel isolated and worried. Stories that will also provide them with answers to help guide their decisions.
Our Team
We are fortunate to have Dr Neal McGrath, a nationally recognized neuropsychologist with over 10 plus years of experience treating concussed patients, overseeing our efforts. Lisa Paradis, Director of Brookline
Recreation and organizer of the New England Youth Concussion Forum, is also
part of our team helping us develop networks that will ensure this content will reach as many families as possible. Eli Davis, a communications major at UMASS Amherst, is responsible for all our social media.

<h1>Our Story</h1>
<div>Everyone
loves great stories, and ours is a simple one. Has anyone ever asked, ""Why
aren’t there earbuds that actually help me look good?” Earbuds are usually
ugly, they don’t go with your style, and they look kind of like a computer chip
on your ear. Come on! Imagine if people saw you and said, “WOW! Where did you
get that; I’ve never seen it before?” With almost every earbud currently out
there, you won’t get this response. That’s why we thought of Solitaire - so
people can actually wear an earbud that looks good! Not one that looks old and
“normal”. Besides, do you want to look “normal”? Probably not. Solitaire is
inspiring and is changing the way people are thinking about earbuds! Anyway,
like I said, people love great stories, and ours is a simple one. <br/>

<h1>Risks and Challenges</h1>
<p></p>
<p><b><u>Risks and challenges: </u></b>You always have a risk to take or a challenge to overcome. We are working with many individuals to make the Solitaire a reality for you; unfortunately, this always comes with unexpected delays and issues.</p>
<p>Work is going as fast as possible to get all things in order. The Solitaire has a few further adjustments to make, and shipping worldwide is not an easy challenge. Indiegogo is only just the beginning of our final journey! There are still a few stepping stones, but don’t worry, the Solitaire will be in your hands before you know it. With your help, we will be able to make the vision a reality.</p>
<p><b><u>Manufacturing:</u></b> The tooling required to manufacture a product of such a small size is expensive. Each Solitaire is hand assembled, requiring a careful yet difficult tooling process. We are working directly with our manufacturerers to insure a prompt delivery that is of the best quality.</p>
<p><b><u>Product Adjustments:</u></b> As the Solitaire is geared up for full scale production, there will be adjustments made. The software has been tested and tested again, but there will probably be a few more unexpected bugs. We want all the kinks out before the Solitaire is in your ear!</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><u>Fulfillment: </u></b>Sometimes things just don’t go according to plan: a supplier misses a shipping deadline, a machine breaks down, or a product shipment is lost. We are directly managing and working with manufacturers who have many years of experience under their belts. There is always a surprise, so we are doing our best to navigate through the rough waters. </p>

Does your earbud look like a brick on your ear? This is the earbud for you! The Solitaire finally lets you look the way you want to when talking or listening to your music. It lets you have a hands-free experience wherever you are. It can connect to more then one device, it's as light as a feather, plus it does all this without you having to recharge it every hour.

Features









Solitaire features cutting edge microchip technologies, a voice detecting microphone, and CVC noise reduction capabilities to provide a truly personal listening experience. 

Dual Connectivity










Who knew such a small earbud could hold such great power? Solitaire comes equipped with smart Bluetooth capabilities, so you can now use two phones at once! 


Battery Level?





If you have an iPhone you can always see how long you have until you need to hit the plug. Never have your music die on you again.



What's All The Hype About?

Are you sick of the dull, grey earbuds everyone uses to talk with? Do you get frustrated with headsets that get in the way of what you actually want to do? Do you get so absolutely tired of wires that they give you headaches, keep you tied to your phone, and force you to untangle a mess? 



Help Make It Happen







Why Solitaire?
What
earbud does not have wires, is not heavy, looks stylish, and actually looks
like it is made in the 21st century? Imagine wearing a heavy, tangled “standard” earbud…It’s not the best. Now imagine wearing an earbud that is
lighter than a feather, unique in shape, has absolutely no wires, and looks stylish.
Usually people like to look “cool” and want to express who they are. You can do
this with basically everything except for your earbuds. They’re supposed to be
ear “buds” and help your ears out, not burden them with something heavy and
ugly! That's why you need Solitaire.

Do you want to keep the old stuff around forever?

CVC & Bluetooth








The Solitaire uses amazing CVC nose cancellation & Bluetooth technologies to create a truly fun and unique experience. 

Get your Solitaire in four different packages. Two Solitaires are better than one! If you have a family that desires a Solitaire for every member, or if you just would love one for yourself, we've got you covered. 

What Are The Colors?




Have you seen the colors? 
Solitaire is not limited to just grey or white, unlike many of your other earbuds on the market. This is why we wanted to make a true piece of art - to let you choose instead of having it chosen for you!

Solitaire History
You know we've come a long way; this is the proof. After our Indiegogo campaign, our number one priority is to get you your solitaire. 



Our Story
Everyone
loves great stories, and ours is a simple one. Has anyone ever asked, ""Why
aren’t there earbuds that actually help me look good?” Earbuds are usually
ugly, they don’t go with your style, and they look kind of like a computer chip
on your ear. Come on! Imagine if people saw you and said, “WOW! Where did you
get that; I’ve never seen it before?” With almost every earbud currently out
there, you won’t get this response. That’s why we thought of Solitaire - so
people can actually wear an earbud that looks good! Not one that looks old and
“normal”. Besides, do you want to look “normal”? Probably not. Solitaire is
inspiring and is changing the way people are thinking about earbuds! Anyway,
like I said, people love great stories, and ours is a simple one.

Risks and Challenges

Risks and challenges: You always have a risk to take or a challenge to overcome. We are working with many individuals to make the Solitaire a reality for you; unfortunately, this always comes with unexpected delays and issues.
Work is going as fast as possible to get all things in order. The Solitaire has a few further adjustments to make, and shipping worldwide is not an easy challenge. Indiegogo is only just the beginning of our final journey! There are still a few stepping stones, but don’t worry, the Solitaire will be in your hands before you know it. With your help, we will be able to make the vision a reality.
Manufacturing: The tooling required to manufacture a product of such a small size is expensive. Each Solitaire is hand assembled, requiring a careful yet difficult tooling process. We are working directly with our manufacturerers to insure a prompt delivery that is of the best quality.
Product Adjustments: As the Solitaire is geared up for full scale production, there will be adjustments made. The software has been tested and tested again, but there will probably be a few more unexpected bugs. We want all the kinks out before the Solitaire is in your ear!

Fulfillment: Sometimes things just don’t go according to plan: a supplier misses a shipping deadline, a machine breaks down, or a product shipment is lost. We are directly managing and working with manufacturers who have many years of experience under their belts. There is always a surprise, so we are doing our best to navigate through the rough waters. 

A Charitable Mention
The Solitaire is paired up with three charities! Heifer International, Pencils Of Promise, and A Human Project. This is because we believe we all should give back and help those who aren't as fortunate. So every time you order a Solitaire and support the campaign, $5 (approximately 8.5%) automatically is dedicated to one of these three nonprofits. We are dedicated to providing you with an awesome earbud while changing the world in the process! Let's Make A Difference!Thank you!



Thank you for your time and support!

Thank you again""</p><p>-Shannon H, Connecticut - one of our early customers  (Thanks for the feedback Shannon!)</p><p>--</p><p><strong>You've seen a Neti Pot or Nasal spray right? Of course. Just think Neti Pot for Carbon Dioxide. That's all this is. </strong>Why would that work? <strong>I'm sure you're familiar with the increasing scientific acceptance that our nerves can trigger massive physical changes, </strong>whether it's from Accupuncture, the sudden rush of adrenaline after hitting your elbow on a cabinet, or the <strong>multiple FDA approved migraine devices that use electrodes </strong>(surgically implanted, sadly) <strong>to trigger the vagus and/or trigeminal nerves. </strong></p><p>You've probably even heard of the 'Daith piercing' that works on migraines for a fraction of migraine sufferers (with tens of thousands of people in that fraction, though)? The Daith piercing is also simply triggering nerves. Science now is aware that our nervous system can trigger cascading effects through our parasympathetic - or unconscious - nervous system that lead to significant physical changes. <strong>The BreatheEasy Migraine device takes advantage of triggering the same vagus and trigeminal nerves as the FDA approved implanted migraine devices - just with nothing more than what amounts to a Neti Pot for carbon dioxide. </strong>Why carbon dioxide? Well, it's concentrated carbon dioxide that causes a mild burning sensation for about 1/3 of a second - like what you get occasionally drinking a carbonated beverage. It, naturally, requires far more carbon dioxide than you have in your breath. That triggers the nerves just as well as electrodes or accupuncture, but then fades without side effects. Nothing goes in your nose except carbon dioxide - which you already have in much lower concentrations in your nose right now. After having triggered those nerves, it causes what researcher Doctor Spiering called a ""Pain cascade"" which is a parasympathetic (unconscious) nervous system reaction that many studies and early FDA trials - listed below - have shown is capable of eliminating or highly reducing migraines in many patients. </p><p> </p><p><strong>O</strong>nce upon a time it was considered impossible to create light without fire. It took mankind thousands and thousands of years to figure it out. It took Thomas Edison TEN THOUSAND tests. But when he finally figured it out, the light bulb really wasn't all that complicated. It solved mankind's age old battle with darkness via a simple and cheap device. History is full of these inventions - hard to find, simple once found. </p><p>You might be willing to pay fifty thousand dollars to get rid of migraines for the rest of your life, but when mankind ultimately finds the solution, it might not be much more complicated than a light bulb. Would you be willing to pay just one hundred dollars to try such a solution?<br/> </p><p><strong style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Y</strong><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>ou shouldn't have to suffer from migraines ever again. Having worked on this product for several years, we've found that migraines often impact people's lives in a way that is far worse than even we expected when we started out. </span></p><p>But we couldn't be more amazed at the feedback we're getting from our first clients. Brandy told us ""So far so good with it! I'm hoping that it keeps working because my insurance doesn't want to pay for the Botox anymore."" That blew me away- we know the science behind the device, the early studies, we know how it has performed with our friends and family that have a few migraines a month. But imagine being in Brandy's position- having to get 9 Botox injections every year, having your expensive, obnoxious, and side-effect prone treatment dropped... and then being able to replace your treatments with a device that fits in your pocket, lasts you years, and costs under one hundred dollars. With no side effects.  </p><p>That blew me away. We knew our customers were going to be skeptical at first, having been offered so many different prospective treatments that turned out to be snake oil. On the other hand, this device is so inexpensive and backed by so much great science and so many comparable devices triggering the same nerves and the same neurological effects that have been approved by the FDA - we thought tons of people would think, ""Why not try it?"" But getting our first customers turned out to be so difficult, so many sufferers thinking they could sit on the sideline and wait and see what became of the device, that we were ready to give up and allow this technology to die. For the second time. If people didn't want to give it a try, well, that's their choice... We tried to bring it to them. And then we heard back from the first customers who DID give it a try. Stories like Brandy's, being saved from thousands of dollars a year and the risks of Botox by a low-cost device that can sit in her purse... Well, that changed everything. I knew we couldn't give up. It might be simple, it might be low cost, but it was letting people live free from their migraines and without side effects as well. That's priceless.</p><p><strong>NOTE: We have the Published, Peer Reviewed Scientific Journal Studies Posted at the Bottom of this Page. Scroll Down to read them!</strong></p><p>As you see in the video, this all started with a promising biotech startup nearly ten years ago that had invented a new way to treat migraines - using only carbon dioxide, which you are exhaling right now. They entered early trials and in their scientific testing proved that the device worked - an astounding 60-65% of the time, which DOUBLED the effectiveness rate of any drug on the market. And because the device worked by activating nerves in the sinuses - much like accu-pressure, using only harmless and natural carbon dioxide in elevated concentrations and for a split second, there were no side effects. The worst case scenario is someone tried the device and it didn't work for them, they were in the 35-40% minority. Oh well. Furthermore, the device ENHANCED the activity of any migraine medications they were using, from Tylenol to prescription drugs. A free and beneficial bonus.</p><p>But that startup decided to sell their patent rights to a drug company that made one of the primary prescription drugs on the market, and that drug company tucked the device away to protect their profits. For years I thought this was just a crappy story. Until it helped my own friend. Watch the video for the full story - but we wound up using our experience at Stanford University's Office of Technology Licensing to design around the patent... And create the even simpler and safer BreatheEasy Migraine Device!</p><p> </p><p>Hear the Entire Crazy (and sometimes hilarious) Story Here!:</p><div>

</div><div> </div><div><strong>Please note that the full video above demonstrates the device and has the full story! It's not the same as the intro video you may have seen on another site!</strong></div><p> </p><p><strong>We are CURRENTLY FULFILLING ORDERS.</strong> As soon as you order, you'll receive your device within about 2 weeks. Our first customers are already using their devices now!</p><p>The device you will get will look like the two pictured on the white background, which is the amazing updated version from what you see in the video! It is more compact, more comfortable, and has a fantastic PUSH BUTTON VALVE which makes it very easy to use. You can choose either lilac or black for color.</p><p> </p><p><strong>We've heard some clients saying they want to know more about how the device actually works. Easy enough!</strong></p><p>The carbon dioxide is reacting with moisture in the sinuses to create a mild carbonic acid, which naturally occurs any time you have carbon dioxide and moisture - so it's in your airways right now. The slightly elevated carbon dioxide levels temporarily create enough weak carbonic acid to create a burning sensation that triggers your vagus nerve in your sinuses. <strong>It takes fairly pure carbon dioxide in your sinuses for about a third of a second - this is why breathing doesn't cause the effect, or breathing into a bag, or just trying to inhale CO2 out of a beverage you just opened (we tried that too). You need to effectively fill your sinuses with CO2 over a slightly extended period of time (again, about a third of a second).</strong></p><p>Any time you've had a carbonated beverage to drink and suddenly gotten a burning sensation in your sinuses, that's effectively what we're talking about. If you can do that on demand, great! But most people sadly can't. The carbon dioxide also increases bloodflow, and through the 'capnic' system which your body uses to monitor CO2 levels, directly arouses the brainstem. That, in turn, combats the migraine!</p><p><strong>Don't think that would work? Check this out:</strong></p><p><a href=""http://www.aetna.com/cpb/medical/data/100_199/0191.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>http://www.aetna.com/cpb/medical/data/100_199/0191.html</strong></a></p><p><a href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-approves-vagus-nerve-stimulator-treat-cluster-headaches-n748036"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-approves-vagus-nerve-stimulator-treat-cluster-headaches-n748036</a></p><p>The FDA has ALREADY approved vagus nerve stimulation for treatment of migraines. Except in that version you need a surgically implanted electrode. The brilliance of this device, and I suppose the reason it was buried by the drug company originally, is that it accomplishes the same exact effect without the implanted electrode. The goal is simply to activate the vagus nerve in the right spot. It doesn't matter if it's done by a mild burning sensation, or an electrode that accomplishes the same effect. </p><p>We've also heard several people say ""What if my migraines have nothing to do with my sinuses?"" That's fine! Your Vagus nerve is in your sinuses and can be activated from the sinuses. However, the vagus nerve interacts with many parts of your brain and controls the level of brain function. Add that in with the effects on bloodflow and the capnic system, and the effect might start in your sinuses, but extends far beyond.</p><p>The final device you get will be even easier to use, far more refined, and custom fabricated for the task - a nice improvement over the prototype you see above. </p><p>But the device we came up with to design around the patent that was bottled up years ago is simpler, cheaper, and even safer to use than the original device. The beauty of our device is it uses carbon dioxide from common soda beverage containers! Cheap, available everywhere, and you know it's safe to consume because you've done it your entire life. The simplicity of the product is its beauty. It makes it incredibly easy for anyone to use, which is critical when you're in the midst of a migraine. </p><p>The great part is that unlike the many snake-oil devices out there, that biotech company did us all a favor by amassing excellent levels of funding and starting the road through FDA trials. That gave us hard science proving the effectiveness of this device and concept! Furthermore, there is an FDA approved implantable electronic device which triggers the SAME nerves as the BreatheEasy Migraine Device and has the SAME effect. Approved by the FDA and in use effectively right now! The difference? That device requires painful and life-changing surgical implantation. Whereas the BreatheEasy Migraine device couldn't be easier to use, and couldn't have less impact on anything EXCEPT migraines and other headaches. </p><p>So this incredibly easy to use device is twice as effective as the best medications, free of side-effects, low cost, and very easy to use. The only risk in trying it is under a hundred bucks and that you might be in the minority that it doesn't work for. The worst that can happen is you spend less than a hundred bucks trying it and find it doesn't work for you - unfortunate, but it's not the end of the world. On the upside it can truly change your life, like it has for many of our clients like Brandy.

What would you give to never have to suffer from migraines again in your life? Ten thousand dollars? Fifty thousand dollars? More?""Hi! Just writing to let you know that the device IS working for me! Had some trouble at first with figuring it out, but have it down now. and WOW! I'm so glad I took a chance on it! Thank you sooo much! I wanted to share it with a migraine group that I'm part of on facebook but I can't find the ad anymore. Please, please don't tell me that you're not going to be making them anymore because it's a fantastic product! I have chronic migraines and am on a twice daily preventative medication, but still need to take an abortive probably 4x a week. Since I figured out how to use this device correctly, I haven't had to use the abortive at all. Thank you again""-Shannon H, Connecticut - one of our early customers  (Thanks for the feedback Shannon!)--You've seen a Neti Pot or Nasal spray right? Of course. Just think Neti Pot for Carbon Dioxide. That's all this is. Why would that work? I'm sure you're familiar with the increasing scientific acceptance that our nerves can trigger massive physical changes, whether it's from Accupuncture, the sudden rush of adrenaline after hitting your elbow on a cabinet, or the multiple FDA approved migraine devices that use electrodes (surgically implanted, sadly) to trigger the vagus and/or trigeminal nerves. You've probably even heard of the 'Daith piercing' that works on migraines for a fraction of migraine sufferers (with tens of thousands of people in that fraction, though)? The Daith piercing is also simply triggering nerves. Science now is aware that our nervous system can trigger cascading effects through our parasympathetic - or unconscious - nervous system that lead to significant physical changes. The BreatheEasy Migraine device takes advantage of triggering the same vagus and trigeminal nerves as the FDA approved implanted migraine devices - just with nothing more than what amounts to a Neti Pot for carbon dioxide. Why carbon dioxide? Well, it's concentrated carbon dioxide that causes a mild burning sensation for about 1/3 of a second - like what you get occasionally drinking a carbonated beverage. It, naturally, requires far more carbon dioxide than you have in your breath. That triggers the nerves just as well as electrodes or accupuncture, but then fades without side effects. Nothing goes in your nose except carbon dioxide - which you already have in much lower concentrations in your nose right now. After having triggered those nerves, it causes what researcher Doctor Spiering called a ""Pain cascade"" which is a parasympathetic (unconscious) nervous system reaction that many studies and early FDA trials - listed below - have shown is capable of eliminating or highly reducing migraines in many patients.  Once upon a time it was considered impossible to create light without fire. It took mankind thousands and thousands of years to figure it out. It took Thomas Edison TEN THOUSAND tests. But when he finally figured it out, the light bulb really wasn't all that complicated. It solved mankind's age old battle with darkness via a simple and cheap device. History is full of these inventions - hard to find, simple once found. You might be willing to pay fifty thousand dollars to get rid of migraines for the rest of your life, but when mankind ultimately finds the solution, it might not be much more complicated than a light bulb. Would you be willing to pay just one hundred dollars to try such a solution? You shouldn't have to suffer from migraines ever again. Having worked on this product for several years, we've found that migraines often impact people's lives in a way that is far worse than even we expected when we started out. But we couldn't be more amazed at the feedback we're getting from our first clients. Brandy told us ""So far so good with it! I'm hoping that it keeps working because my insurance doesn't want to pay for the Botox anymore."" That blew me away- we know the science behind the device, the early studies, we know how it has performed with our friends and family that have a few migraines a month. But imagine being in Brandy's position- having to get 9 Botox injections every year, having your expensive, obnoxious, and side-effect prone treatment dropped... and then being able to replace your treatments with a device that fits in your pocket, lasts you years, and costs under one hundred dollars. With no side effects.  That blew me away. We knew our customers were going to be skeptical at first, having been offered so many different prospective treatments that turned out to be snake oil. On the other hand, this device is so inexpensive and backed by so much great science and so many comparable devices triggering the same nerves and the same neurological effects that have been approved by the FDA - we thought tons of people would think, ""Why not try it?"" But getting our first customers turned out to be so difficult, so many sufferers thinking they could sit on the sideline and wait and see what became of the device, that we were ready to give up and allow this technology to die. For the second time. If people didn't want to give it a try, well, that's their choice... We tried to bring it to them. And then we heard back from the first customers who DID give it a try. Stories like Brandy's, being saved from thousands of dollars a year and the risks of Botox by a low-cost device that can sit in her purse... Well, that changed everything. I knew we couldn't give up. It might be simple, it might be low cost, but it was letting people live free from their migraines and without side effects as well. That's priceless.NOTE: We have the Published, Peer Reviewed Scientific Journal Studies Posted at the Bottom of this Page. Scroll Down to read them!As you see in the video, this all started with a promising biotech startup nearly ten years ago that had invented a new way to treat migraines - using only carbon dioxide, which you are exhaling right now. They entered early trials and in their scientific testing proved that the device worked - an astounding 60-65% of the time, which DOUBLED the effectiveness rate of any drug on the market. And because the device worked by activating nerves in the sinuses - much like accu-pressure, using only harmless and natural carbon dioxide in elevated concentrations and for a split second, there were no side effects. The worst case scenario is someone tried the device and it didn't work for them, they were in the 35-40% minority. Oh well. Furthermore, the device ENHANCED the activity of any migraine medications they were using, from Tylenol to prescription drugs. A free and beneficial bonus.But that startup decided to sell their patent rights to a drug company that made one of the primary prescription drugs on the market, and that drug company tucked the device away to protect their profits. For years I thought this was just a crappy story. Until it helped my own friend. Watch the video for the full story - but we wound up using our experience at Stanford University's Office of Technology Licensing to design around the patent... And create the even simpler and safer BreatheEasy Migraine Device! Hear the Entire Crazy (and sometimes hilarious) Story Here!:


 

 
 Please note that the full video above demonstrates the device and has the full story! It's not the same as the intro video you may have seen on another site! We are CURRENTLY FULFILLING ORDERS. As soon as you order, you'll receive your device within about 2 weeks. Our first customers are already using their devices now!The device you will get will look like the two pictured on the white background, which is the amazing updated version from what you see in the video! It is more compact, more comfortable, and has a fantastic PUSH BUTTON VALVE which makes it very easy to use. You can choose either lilac or black for color. We've heard some clients saying they want to know more about how the device actually works. Easy enough!The carbon dioxide is reacting with moisture in the sinuses to create a mild carbonic acid, which naturally occurs any time you have carbon dioxide and moisture - so it's in your airways right now. The slightly elevated carbon dioxide levels temporarily create enough weak carbonic acid to create a burning sensation that triggers your vagus nerve in your sinuses. It takes fairly pure carbon dioxide in your sinuses for about a third of a second - this is why breathing doesn't cause the effect, or breathing into a bag, or just trying to inhale CO2 out of a beverage you just opened (we tried that too). You need to effectively fill your sinuses with CO2 over a slightly extended period of time (again, about a third of a second).Any time you've had a carbonated beverage to drink and suddenly gotten a burning sensation in your sinuses, that's effectively what we're talking about. If you can do that on demand, great! But most people sadly can't. The carbon dioxide also increases bloodflow, and through the 'capnic' system which your body uses to monitor CO2 levels, directly arouses the brainstem. That, in turn, combats the migraine!Don't think that would work? Check this out:http://www.aetna.com/cpb/medical/data/100_199/0191.htmlhttp://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-approves-vagus-nerve-stimulator-treat-cluster-headaches-n748036The FDA has ALREADY approved vagus nerve stimulation for treatment of migraines. Except in that version you need a surgically implanted electrode. The brilliance of this device, and I suppose the reason it was buried by the drug company originally, is that it accomplishes the same exact effect without the implanted electrode. The goal is simply to activate the vagus nerve in the right spot. It doesn't matter if it's done by a mild burning sensation, or an electrode that accomplishes the same effect. We've also heard several people say ""What if my migraines have nothing to do with my sinuses?"" That's fine! Your Vagus nerve is in your sinuses and can be activated from the sinuses. However, the vagus nerve interacts with many parts of your brain and controls the level of brain function. Add that in with the effects on bloodflow and the capnic system, and the effect might start in your sinuses, but extends far beyond.The final device you get will be even easier to use, far more refined, and custom fabricated for the task - a nice improvement over the prototype you see above. But the device we came up with to design around the patent that was bottled up years ago is simpler, cheaper, and even safer to use than the original device. The beauty of our device is it uses carbon dioxide from common soda beverage containers! Cheap, available everywhere, and you know it's safe to consume because you've done it your entire life. The simplicity of the product is its beauty. It makes it incredibly easy for anyone to use, which is critical when you're in the midst of a migraine. The great part is that unlike the many snake-oil devices out there, that biotech company did us all a favor by amassing excellent levels of funding and starting the road through FDA trials. That gave us hard science proving the effectiveness of this device and concept! Furthermore, there is an FDA approved implantable electronic device which triggers the SAME nerves as the BreatheEasy Migraine Device and has the SAME effect. Approved by the FDA and in use effectively right now! The difference? That device requires painful and life-changing surgical implantation. Whereas the BreatheEasy Migraine device couldn't be easier to use, and couldn't have less impact on anything EXCEPT migraines and other headaches. So this incredibly easy to use device is twice as effective as the best medications, free of side-effects, low cost, and very easy to use. The only risk in trying it is under a hundred bucks and that you might be in the minority that it doesn't work for. The worst that can happen is you spend less than a hundred bucks trying it and find it doesn't work for you - unfortunate, but it's not the end of the world. On the upside it can truly change your life, like it has for many of our clients like Brandy. Sure it's a little funny looking to use it, but less than a hundred dollars and looking silly in private in the bathroom are a small price to pay for getting rid of migraines! If you're a blogger or work for a magazine or other media outlet, please e-mail me at dak.steiert@alumni.stanford.edu - we have the ability to send media prototypes. If you suffer from migraines and tell us which blog or media organization you work for, we'd be happy to send you out a prototype for free right away so that you can try it out. We only ask that if it works for you, you write about it as soon as possible so that this project can succeed and we can go into production and help thousands more! We sincerely hope this helps as many people as possible!

Yet, it is strange to find out that our devices are filthy dirty, studies have found that they are 18x dirtier than a toilet seat and yet what do we do? We put these devices up to our faces and swipe the screens with our fingers, all while we are having lunch! That’s just how it is. We discovered a long term solution for you.

 
THE SELF-SANITISING™ SHIELD
When we asked around why people didn't sanitise their phone despite medical professional repeatedly suggest that phone is the No. 1 Disease transmission medium. The most common feedback was that ""I have no time"" ""Boring"" ""I'm not sure""
So, We have carefully analysed and zoomed in to the materials used by these gadgets and created a brand new solution that we call Self-Sanitising™ Technology. Inspired by ""Human Antibody"" -- a system that protect against diseases automatically and regenerate by itself. THYMOS® releases negatively charged bacteriostatic electrons to form an invisible shield to give your phone a ""Man-Made-Antibody"" resulting a phone that protects against pathogens automatically whenever you touch.
 
NO MORE REPEATED SCRUBS, ONCE IS ENOUGH.
Medical Revolution
This is our medical signature feature and we’ve filed a patent while we incorporated it into GadgetCare™. Without the use of Alcohols or Toxic-chemicals, instead THYMOS® uses Activated Mineral to generate bacteriostatic electron in sterilising the pathogens. Best? The shield continuously regenerates itself and last up to 365 days. This is a breakthroughs innovation in redefining hygiene and we believed the future is ""automatically"".
 
NO MORE OILY SCREEN & SMELLY ODOUR
How does it work? THYMOS® makes your screen super-hydrophilic to ensure liquid such as sweat, dusts and grease impossible to stand on. In an instant application, you can control your phone even with sweaty/greasy hands without stubborn odours - at the same time, enhancing your touchscreen sensitivity so you will never miss a corner again. MEDICAL STANDARDWhile other sanitisers reduce bacteria temporarily, we turn the world's deadliest viruses into ash!With GadgetCare, you will see oxidised-protein stains on the surface of your phone everyday when you woke up.

<p>Pulmonary hypertension begins when tiny arteries in your lungs, called pulmonary arteries, and capillaries become narrowed, blocked or destroyed. This makes it harder for blood to flow through your lungs, and raises pressure within your lungs' arteries.

<h2>Our Story<br/>
</h2>
<p>     Marlee Ross and Myfanwy Bakker, a mother-daughter team, will be embarking in early September 2011 on a medical pilgrimage to the remote northern region of Nepal, the Tibetan Buddhist Kingdom of Mustang. </p>
<p>     Myfanwy as a Registered Nurse, and Marlee as a Buddhist Chaplain, will be joining Roshi Joan Halifax, Abbott of Upaya Zen Centre in New Mexico, and her team of clinicians and support workers, to serve the nomadic people of Mustang in a series of Nomads Medical Clinics that have been established over 30 years of pilgrimage and practice.</p>
<p>     The above video demonstrates the success of the medical clinics previously established under the leadership of Roshi Joan Halifax. The Mustang region of Nepal, where we will be serving is virtually identical in its remote geography, and pressing medical and educational needs as the region of Kham.</p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;""><br/></span></p>
<h2>The Impact<br/>
</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>     Mustang is a Buddhist kingdom in the remotest area of the Nepalese Himalayas. Only a handful of Westerners had visited there before it was opened in 1992. Travellers brought back reports of a culturally highly developed, thriving medieval society and a geography almost beyond description, with its towering columns of earth and stone, and tightly woven villages in the fertile veins of a sculptured landscape. </p>
<p>     Today, the population lives nomadically or in intimate adobe villages, situated to grow crops of barley, buckwheat and potatoes. Heards of yaks, goats and sheep move seasonally across the remote high trails. Although physically striking, this remote area of the Himalayas now suffers from extreme poverty. There is virtually no consistent medical care or education available, as Nepal has such a fragile infrastructure. On average there is one doctor for every 20 000 Nepalese and this ratio increases drastically in remote areas like Mustang. </p>
<p>     The route we follow is off the main trail, deep in the mountains and canyons of old Mustang. We will walk, or ride horses, in this extraordinary landscape, offering medical care, and basic survival and educational supplies to the nomads and villagers as we move along.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>What We Need <br/>
</h2>
</div>
<div>     The money raised through this campaign will go directly to the purchase of medical, survival and educational supplies for the people of Mustang, Nepal. Marlee and Myfanwy will personally purchase the items in Canada, which have been specifically requested by Roshi Joan Halifax and her medical team lead Kat, an RN who has served in multiple Nomads Medical Clinics. We will personally transport these humanitarian supplies to Nepal, and participate directly in their distribution and use in the medical clinics.

been a successful barber since the age of 15.  Like many who venture out

 a successful business. Omar has followed his dreams relentlessly. Due 
to an aggressive approach on treating this disease, Omar has been forced
 to close his business and will no longer be able to work until he is 
completely cancer free.  Without medical coverage and limited resources

sustain his health and financial well-being, Omar is at a tremendous 
financial loss because of his inability to work.  We are reaching out to

<li>
<b>A probiotic acne therapy </b> consists of<b> ""good"" bacteria that are part of the healthy skin microbiota. </b>They are topically applied to the skin and should <b>out-compete the ""bad""</b> <b>bacterial population </b>as seen on acne-affected skin.

Selv den mindste donation gør en forskel

DEVELOPING A PROBIOTIC CURE AGAINST ACNE

Your donation makes the difference 

Why a probiotic treatment and why now? 

Treatment against acne has not changed for several decades, They consist of antibiotics and retinoids that are applied for several months; these can have several side effects.
Since a few years, we realize how important the bacterial microbiota is for our health. We want to exploit these new reseach findings.

A probiotic acne therapy  consists of ""good"" bacteria that are part of the healthy skin microbiota. They are topically applied to the skin and should out-compete the ""bad"" bacterial population as seen on acne-affected skin. This treatment will have presumably minimal to no risks of side effects. 

Our international team of scientists and dermatologists at Aarhus University, Rockefeller University and University of Cambridge will test the feasibility of this probiotic treatment option. PLEASE HELP US NOW! 

More information about the project and about us: www.acnesci.com




Why this crowdfunding project?
By funding our research you will help us in our efforts to cure acne, and potentially help millions who daily suffer from the stigmatization of this skin disease, leaving many patients in isolation resulting in increased rates of joblessness, depression and even suicide.
We are an international science team based at Aarhus University, Denmark. Our previous research revealed the association of certain types of bacteria with normal skin and others that are associated with acne vulgaris.                                 



Help us raise funds and support us in our efforts to exploit these findings in making a cream containing health-associated bacteria, aimed to out-compete the subgroups of acne-associated bacteria and their products which trigger inflammation of the skin seen in acne. This topically applied cream would then work similarly to other probiotic products, e.g. yogurts to influence the gut microbiota. 









The budget for the study:








Replacement strategy 40,000 USD



microbiota sequencing(before/after treatment: n=10): 32,000 USD


bacterial cultivation, skin sample preparation/extraction: 8,000 USD



Inhibition strategy 60,000 USD

<p>We want to THANK each and every person who has donated so far! The support my Mom has received is amazing and it is very much helping her keep strong. We have had a lot of requests to keep this Campaign going, and although IndieGoGo doesnt let you ""Extend"" Campaigns, they very much encourage reposting Campaigns, so we decided to go ahead and repost this Campaign to allow people to continue donating if they choose to, but most importantly my Mom very much enjoys using the Campaign to post her Updates and Status/Reports through out her process. It is also a great place for people to also post comments/support just to show her how much everyone truely does care and support and love her! We want everyone to know we will be getting the ""Perks"" from the first Campaign out to everyone who has supplied their address, please be patient as of course our health makes everything a bit slower, but we will get our offical THANKS out very soon! I hope everyone know how much all the support means to not only my Mom but to us as a Family! Please keep watching this Campaign and reading the Updates my Mom places in the ""Update"" tab at the top of this page. The URL <a href=""http://www.4Lynnette.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.4Lynnette.com </a>will point to the new Campaign as soon as it updates as well, but if you would like to see the old Campaign, or read previous updates you can still do that by going to <a href=""http://igg.me/p/304397/x/1796013"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://igg.me/p/304397/x/1796013</a></p>
<p>I will also repost the original Campaign story below so anyone new to the Campaign can have a chance to read a wonderful story about a wonderful Woman! LOVE YOU MOM!</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2><strong><em>Original Story-</em></strong></h2>
<div class=""user-content"">
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">The next few minutes are for anyone who cares enough to take the next few minutes of their life to read about a women who deserves every minute you give her! My name is Richard, son of Lynnette and Johnny. I really have no idea where to begin, my parents are quite literally my best friends and I would not change it for a thing. In this Campaign I went further then just ""asking for donations"", I want this Campaign to tell my Moms story!</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Let start in 1983 when my Mom Lynnette just found out she was pregnant. This is a time when most women are so very much happy and excited, and I am sure my Mom had felt the same way, but behind all that excitement still laid a feeling that NO women wants to feel. To explain what I mean, I need to take you back even further, when my Mom was 9 years old she was diagnosed with Kidney Disease. She spent her whole childhood in &amp; out of hospitals, surgery's and transplants. By the age of 13 she has went through more then most people need to go through in a life time 10 times over, and over the years she has had TWO transplants, the years following I am sure she was excited that the 2nd transplant was doing well, but the disease also left her with a lifetime of other problems like very low immune system, life long medications, other complications including NOT having children. So when my Mom found out she was pregnant with me....a time when a woman is suppose to be on top of the world, the doctors are telling her she CANNOT have me, but against ALL the doctors NO's my Mom stood tall and told them all that she did not care the risks to herself, if the baby would be healthy is all she cared about, so putting ALL her problems and health aside for me, she went on with the pregnancy. Sure there were some complications, and some problems here and there but she said strong through the whole process and never once put herself before me, she quite literally was 100% willing to give her own life, to give life to her baby son....ME, and I will never ever forget that.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Through the years our Family has had many many downs, but I would trade nothing for all the great UP's that we had as well! Though my Mom had a hard childhood that led to a rough adulthood, she always gave her heart to the people around her. When I was 5 years old my Father was in a very bad accident that left him with a broken back and broken neck that led to MANY MANY surgeries, and even though my Mom had so many things to worry about with herself she still stood by his side through every single one of those surgeries giving her support, help and love to him and I, taking care of ANYTHING that needed to be done, paying bills, working 2 jobs to pay bills, driving to hospitals, running the house! She did ANYTHING the family needed, because she cared! My Father and I can not thank her enough, nor would a thanks be close to enough. My Father still of course has many problems and is still to this day having surgeries to help with the problems, and even now 20 years later my Mom STILL does everything she can for him and I.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">In 2005 another tragedy struck when I was in a very severe high speed motorcycle accident that left me hospitalized for a month, and after discharged I needed home care for the next year. The hospital recommended a temp home, or a full time nurse to help, but my Mom INSISTED that she help her baby boy, she spent the next year of her life changing bandages and taking care of me in ANYWAY that she could, because that is just the type of wonderful person she is. How do you thank someone for something like that? And again same as my Father, to this day...even 8 years later I still have chronic pain and problems, and again still to this day my Mom gives her heart to make sure she does everything she can to make my life just that much better. And I truly cannot ever thank her enough for everything she has done and continues TO do for me. A few years after my accident, my Mom was in a accident as well that ended up totaling her pick-up truck and left her with chronic back pain and has also had a knee replacement, but even with those problems piled on to everything else....she STILL stands strong and gives 100% to the Family.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Then in 2006 my Grandma became ill, and my Mom being the wonderful person she was, stopped working and basically moved in with my Grandma (Her Mother). She lived with my Grandmother for about 80% of the time for the next 2 years, and helped my Grandmother is any and every way she could, driving her, cleaning her, cleaning her house, laundry, pay bills and everything else needed to make my Grandmas life just that much easier for her, ALL on top of still taking care of my Father and I all at the same time, I truly do not know how she did it, I think she is secretly superwoman, and if shes not....then she is 100% still Superwoman in my eyes that is for sure. Unfortunately my Grandmother passed away, and that was very hard on my Mom, and still is, but again my Mom stands strong giving 100% to us, and again....how on earth does someone show how much that means to them? It means the world to me, and I hope she realizes that.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">You normally would think that....come on, this Family has been through enough, they lived happily ever after.....right? Unfortunately, this is not the way the cards fell. December 19th, 2012, my Mom was diagnosed with Stomach Cancer, its is very hard to come to terms with this because although NO person deserves that horrible disease, but I think she truly deserves to NOT have been burdened with this, she has been through to much to deal her such cards. She will be spending time going through surgeries and tests, chemo, etc. &amp; she is tough enough that I know she will beat it, but I also wanted to come here to let the world know the wonderful person she is, and hope she will be in everyone's prayers and thoughts. Unfortunately my Mom has NO insurance, and I need to reach out more then ever for a helping hand from ANYONE who has a hand to give. Family, Friends, and Strangers alike, I think my Mom Lynnette DESERVES more then anyone to NOT have to have this burden on her shoulders and I would like for this Campaign to get as Viral as possible to not only tell her story and show my everlasting love. But I also truly believe that my Mom 100% DESERVES a break, I would not only like this campaign to generate enough money to help pay doctors, hospitals, prescriptions and treatments, BUT I also would love for it to generate enough money for her to just get away for awhile.......relax.....really truly take a break, she has been working NON STOP since 9 years old....Don t you think she FINALLY deserves a vacation?</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Please help in anyway you can! If all you can do is pass this campaign on to someone else, then PLEASE do. If you can afford to donate then by all means, PLEASE do. Lynnette really deserves SO much more, but if telling her story and reaching a helping hand makes a big enough difference to lift just SOME of that burden, then at least I feel like I have just STARTED the process of repaying my Mom for all the Love, Blood, Sweat, Tears and more Love that my Mom has given me my entire life! I want her Positive, Standing Strong and Determined, the last thing I want on her mind is how bills are going to be paid, she has other things to focus on right now! Thank you for taking the time to read this, and again please help in anyway possible, if you know her at all you KNOW she more then deserves the help and if you do not know her, I hope you feel like you do know her enough now to know that she deserves all the help that is given.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>I have Faith my Mom will handle this like she has handled all the other hurdles in her life, and beat it! But every prayer helps!</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Again Thank you.</p>

Lynnette really deserves SO much more, but if telling her story and reaching a helping hand makes a big enough difference to lift just SOME of that burden, then at least I feel like I have just STARTED the process of repaying my Mom for all the Love, Blood, Sweat, Tears and more Love that my Mom has given me my entire life! I want her Positive, Standing Strong and Determined, the last thing I want on her mind is how bills are going to be paid, she has other things to focus on right now! Thank you for taking the time to read this, and again please help in anyway possible, if you know her at all you KNOW she more then deserves the help and if you do not know her, I hope you feel like you do know her enough now to know that she deserves all the help that is given.
 
I have Faith my Mom will handle this like she has handled all the other hurdles in her life, and beat it! But every prayer helps!
 
Again Thank you.

<h3>About Rich</h3>
<p>It's been a long road to this point. Genetically shortsheeted and running out of time and resources, Rich's jaw is in serious need of help.</p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Basically, I need money. Lots of it. Or donations of a surgeon's time or a dentist's time. But for the purposes of this campaign, my family and I need the funds required to add a new implant into my upper jaw.</p>
<p>The implant, crown, and time away from work to recouperate will end up running about $3,500 and the cost of the extraction surgery that is already floating on a credit card is another $1,500.</p>
<p>Every little bit will help keep us out of bankrupcy.</p>
<p>Contributors will get one of a few things.</p>
<ul>
<li>A hand-written thank you card, signed by each member of my family.</li>
<li>A laminated bookmark with some of my favorite quotes printed on it.</li>
<li>A custom airbrushed T-shirt (you provide the idea, I provide the inspiration and brushwork)</li>
<li>A custom airbrushed Hoodie (you provide the idea, I provide the inspiration and brushwork)</li>
<li>other perks also available</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This will mean a world of difference to me and my family. If we raise enough to meet the goal of $5,000, our immediate worries will very nearly be washed away. If we raise more and are fortunate enough to raise enough for more work on my jaw, it will keep me healthy and strong so I can keep supporting my family.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you just can't contribute, not even $5, it's OK. You can still help by getting the word out to your friends and co-workers. Remember, we're trying to improve the quality of life for Rich, so let's get the word out.</p>

Here’s how:</p>
<p>1.

improving the flavor!</b>  We’ve figured
out how to improve the taste without adding additional sugar or interfering
with its effectiveness.  (We’d tell you
how, but then we’d have to hire you…)</p>
<p>2. 
<b>We’re
getting it NSF Sports Certified!</b> 
Believe it or not, we’ve been getting inquiries from several professional
baseball teams and a professional basketball team.  Their athletes are asking for this, but can’t
take it until we get it certified (assuring them that among other things, they
won’t flunk a drug test…).  But we

time. When we looked for help, <b>we found two types of sleep aids:</b></p>
<ul>

<p><b>There was nothing in the middle.</b> There was no

<p><b>Food for Sleep is:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The<b> only</b> drug-free
     and non-habit-forming sleep aid that is both effective AND gentle</li>
<li>The <b>first</b> sleep
     aid made using food ingredients supported by clinical studies (Montmorency
     tart cherry juice and a whey protein high in tryptophan)</li>
<li>The <b>best</b> for
     waking up refreshed with no hangover and no side effects (it's foods!)</li>

use it?</b></p>
<p>Shake
well.  Drink the entire bottle a half-hour before you’d like to be
asleep.  Shut off your laptop, cell phone, TV, and other sleep
disruptors.  Get in bed with something to read.  Sweet dreams. 
That’s it.</p>
<p><b>Can I take Food for Sleep every
night?</b> </p><p>Remember that it's just food - and published clinical trials have shown no
issues with consuming tart cherry juice or whey protein daily. <br/>
<br/>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Does it need to be refrigerated? </b></p><p>No, but some of our users report that they enjoy Food for Sleep chilled.
Cool! </p>
<b><b>
</b></b><p><b>How does it taste? </b></p><p>It's wicked tart! (Sorry - we're from Boston.) The tart cherry juice plus
whey protein would taste better if we added sugar, but our customers persuaded
us that they didn't want any extra calories. Funders of our Indiegogo campaign
will be the first to taste the new and improved flavor, with no decrease in
efficacy and no added sugar. </p><b>
</b><p><b>What if something happens and I have to stay awake after
drinking Food for Sleep</b><sup>TM</sup><b>?</b></p>

it just simulates your body’s natural processes that lead to sleep.  </p>

<p><b>Can I
travel with it?</b></p>
<p>Yes. When we
were interviewing people, everyone asked for something small enough to fit in a
briefcase or a purse.  We also learned that a lot of you travel for
business, and you have to deal with the TSA’s rules about what you can carry in
your luggage.  The limit is 3 oz. bottles, and ours is <b>2 ½ oz. bottle</b>. 
We’ve gone through the scanners with as many as eight bottles in our carry-on
luggage – no problem.</p>

medical nutrition for about two decades. His interest has always been in
creating scientifically sound products that address specific conditions, using
nutrition rather than drugs. Helping people get a good night’s sleep really has
Bob excited: sleep is so fundamental to our health, our well-being and maybe
even to our sanity. There’s a huge need to help people sleep without drugs. Bob
is excited to be working on just that, and to be doing it with a talented and
enthusiastic team.</p>
<p>In addition to this company, Bob has launched three prior
companies in medical nutrition, working in areas such as diabetes, weight
management and more. All of those companies were with staff and faculty at
Harvard Medical School, and led to consumer products that were sold through
retail pharmacies. At other times, Bob has served as CEO of Vitasoy USA (a
management turn-around), worked as a principal in a strategy consulting firm,
and he's held sales and marketing positions at Abbott Laboratories and Baxter
International. Bob has degrees from Princeton University (biology) and MIT
Sloan (management). After hours, he plays in a blues band, he's a springboard
diver and an enthusiastic motorcyclist.</p>
<p><b>Jason Paruthi, MD</b> is our Senior Market Manager
at Food for Sleep. Although Jason rocked his way through Boston University, BU
Medical School and a residency and research program at Harvard Medical School,
the poor guy was bitten by the entrepreneurial bug. As you know, this is rarely
fatal, but it’s usually incurable. As a published researcher in obesity and
diabetes, Jason spent a lot of time working in hospitals. He saw that his
patients constantly complained of trouble sleeping, but they were very
concerned about the side effects associated with sleeping pills. One thing led
to another, and he found his way to our little company. We’re now lucky to have

how, but then we’d have to hire you…)
2. 
We’re
getting it NSF Sports Certified! 
Believe it or not, we’ve been getting inquiries from several professional
baseball teams and a professional basketball team.  Their athletes are asking for this, but can’t
take it until we get it certified (assuring them that among other things, they
won’t flunk a drug test…).  But we
weren’t kidding when we said that this is a POTENT TOOL TO ENHANCE ATHLETIC
PERFORMANCE.3. We’re manufacturing more!  Because
we’re almost SOLD OUT of our initial batch.

Need more?  Here a few testimonials:



Does anyone that’s normal use this stuff?
You mean, people who aren’t competitive athletes?  You bet. 
Here are a few comments from them:So no more delays! 
Pick a perk, tell your friends, and let us help you score your personal

Frequently Asked Questions:
How does Food for Sleep compare to other things I could
take for sleep?
Like many of you, we’ve had trouble sleeping for a long
time. When we looked for help, we found two types of sleep aids:

Sleep
     aids that don’t work at all (herbs, potions)
Other
     sleep aids that hit us like a freight train (pills,
     chemicals, drugs)


(Artist
representation of the other guys)
There was nothing in the middle. There was no
amazing, gentle, sweet dream nectar that wasn’t full of chemicals, drugs, herbs
or hocus pocus.
Food for Sleep is:

The only drug-free
     and non-habit-forming sleep aid that is both effective AND gentle
The first sleep
     aid made using food ingredients supported by clinical studies (Montmorency
     tart cherry juice and a whey protein high in tryptophan)
The best for
     waking up refreshed with no hangover and no side effects (it's foods!)

We developed a little table that compares some of the
alternatives.

How do I
use it?
Shake
well.  Drink the entire bottle a half-hour before you’d like to be
asleep.  Shut off your laptop, cell phone, TV, and other sleep
disruptors.  Get in bed with something to read.  Sweet dreams. 
That’s it.
Can I take Food for Sleep every
night? Remember that it's just food - and published clinical trials have shown no
issues with consuming tart cherry juice or whey protein daily. 

Does it need to be refrigerated? No, but some of our users report that they enjoy Food for Sleep chilled.
Cool! 

How does it taste? It's wicked tart! (Sorry - we're from Boston.) The tart cherry juice plus
whey protein would taste better if we added sugar, but our customers persuaded
us that they didn't want any extra calories. Funders of our Indiegogo campaign
will be the first to taste the new and improved flavor, with no decrease in
efficacy and no added sugar. 
What if something happens and I have to stay awake after
drinking Food for SleepTM?
Then you’ll stay awake. It’s not a sedative –
it just simulates your body’s natural processes that lead to sleep.  

Can I
travel with it?
Yes. When we
were interviewing people, everyone asked for something small enough to fit in a
briefcase or a purse.  We also learned that a lot of you travel for
business, and you have to deal with the TSA’s rules about what you can carry in
your luggage.  The limit is 3 oz. bottles, and ours is 2 ½ oz. bottle. 
We’ve gone through the scanners with as many as eight bottles in our carry-on
luggage – no problem.
Is it recyclable?
Yes. 
It took a bit of work, but we found a recyclable
bottle that’s sturdy enough to handle our magic hot-fill process.
Who we are – the team
Bob Jones:  Bob has been in the field of
medical nutrition for about two decades. His interest has always been in
creating scientifically sound products that address specific conditions, using
nutrition rather than drugs. Helping people get a good night’s sleep really has
Bob excited: sleep is so fundamental to our health, our well-being and maybe
even to our sanity. There’s a huge need to help people sleep without drugs. Bob
is excited to be working on just that, and to be doing it with a talented and
enthusiastic team.
In addition to this company, Bob has launched three prior
companies in medical nutrition, working in areas such as diabetes, weight
management and more. All of those companies were with staff and faculty at
Harvard Medical School, and led to consumer products that were sold through
retail pharmacies. At other times, Bob has served as CEO of Vitasoy USA (a
management turn-around), worked as a principal in a strategy consulting firm,
and he's held sales and marketing positions at Abbott Laboratories and Baxter
International. Bob has degrees from Princeton University (biology) and MIT
Sloan (management). After hours, he plays in a blues band, he's a springboard
diver and an enthusiastic motorcyclist.
Jason Paruthi, MD is our Senior Market Manager
at Food for Sleep. Although Jason rocked his way through Boston University, BU
Medical School and a residency and research program at Harvard Medical School,
the poor guy was bitten by the entrepreneurial bug. As you know, this is rarely
fatal, but it’s usually incurable. As a published researcher in obesity and
diabetes, Jason spent a lot of time working in hospitals. He saw that his
patients constantly complained of trouble sleeping, but they were very
concerned about the side effects associated with sleeping pills. One thing led
to another, and he found his way to our little company. We’re now lucky to have
him as part of our team, meeting many of you and growing our business.
Risks & Challenges
We’ve gone through our first manufacturing process already,
and we have been listening to early users and compiling a list of improvements
to make ever since we launched. We have our manufacturer lined up and are ready
with recipes to improve the flavor as well.
However, there is always the potential for unforeseen issues
with our supplier or manufacturers that could lead to delays. We will do our
best to avoid these and help you and all our happy customers sleep well again
as quickly as possible.",16.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>I went out to the lobby to where the nurses were stationed. I spoke with the woman behind the desk, explaining my concern. Two women that had come over to the desk immediately came out of their station to go to the room. They could see the desperation on my face and knew I was scared. I was hopeful that I had acted in time and grateful that I did not have to argue with them to get results. I followed closely behind them to make sure they would do everything in their power to figure out what the problem was. I knew that Lupe was not out of the woods yet.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The nurses went into the room first and as they entered I approached behind them. I went to Lupe and began speaking to her. She was barely hanging on. It was then that Lupe told the nurses she thought she had peed and she could feel she was wet. One the women went to the foot of the bed. She took hold of the sheet and bgan to draw it back. All the while I was trying to keep Lupe from losing conciousness. She lifted the sheet and I saw terror on her face. I looked down in just enough time to what she had saw. There was a pool of blood resting on the bed between Lupe's legs. Her cervix had gotten torn during the birth.</strong></p>
<p><strong>She had bled out so much her blood pressure was 40 over 20. It took twelve pints of blood and three pints of plasma to keep her alive.

<h2>HELP US HELP SENIOR ATHLETES</h2>
<p>Thousands of men and women senior athletes are forced to stop playing sports prematurely due to injuries and pain that could have been completely avoided if they knew how to ""reset their bodies.""</p>
<p>I'm Dori O'Rourke, an avid senior athlete and senior sports proponent and I'm partnering with senior fitness specialist and senior sports expert, Kirsten Cummings to co-author this ground-breaking book designed to show senior athletes how to reset their bodies so they can enjoy a lifetime of sports and play. </p>
<p>Kirsten and I have both been athletes our entire lives and we love sports, especially senior sports.  To see athletes get hurt and be forced to stop playing is heartbreaking to us ... especially when it could have been avoided! </p>
<p>With your help, we can show senior athletes the 5 simple things they can do to get their bodies in a position to play for the rest of their lives. </p>
<p>Playing sports isn't just for fun, the ability to move our bodies literally helps keep us alive.  When we stop moving, our bodies start dying.  That's why playing sports is one of the greatest ways to live a long, happy, healthy life.</p>

<h2>
<br/>WHY SENIOR ATHLETES NEED THIS BOOK</h2>
<h3>
<strong><em>Senior Athletes: Reset Your Body … or BUST!</em></strong><br/>How to Reset Your Body Back to Its Natural State <br/>So You Can Enjoy a Lifetime of Sports and Play</h3>
<p>Adults turning 50 can now look forward to playing sports for another 30, 40 or even 50 years. Isn't that amazing!</p>
<p>Unfortunately though, while it’s completely realistic for men and women to be able to enjoy playing sports and other recreational activities for their entire lives, many seniors won’t.</p>
<p>That’s because many seniors will find themselves limited by pain and injuries that will gradually get worse with time, forcing them to give up one sport and activity after another, in what appears to be the inevitable result of old age.</p>
<p>BUT, the truth is, most pain and injuries are NOT DUE TO OLD AGE, they’re the direct result of a body that has lost its ""natural position"" – something that is COMPLETELY PREVENTABLE given the right knowledge, training, and support.</p>
<p>As we get older, it’s not age that is causing our physical problems, it’s the daily activities of life that have gradually led our bodies to become more and more off track.</p>
<p>While our bodies do a masterful job of adapting and compensating, this can only last so long before one compensation after another eventually puts us into such a compromised position that pain and injury are the result. In other words ... we BUST!</p>
<p>The GREAT NEWS is, we can dramatically prevent pain, reduce injuries, and increase our recovery time by simply “resetting our bodies.”</p>
<p><strong><em>In Senior Athletes: Reset Your Body … or BUST!</em> </strong>we’re going to show senior athletes the warning signs they need to know about and provide the information they need to recover the alignment and balance they had when they were younger.</p>
<p>With this book, senior athletes will truly be able to look forward to enjoying a lifetime of sports and play!</p>

<h2>
<br/>THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!</h2>
<p>Senior athletes are our passion and we’re committed to helping men and women senior athletes play sports for as long as they'd like. </p>

<br/>THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR SUPPORT!</h2></div>","HELP US HELP SENIOR ATHLETES
Thousands of men and women senior athletes are forced to stop playing sports prematurely due to injuries and pain that could have been completely avoided if they knew how to ""reset their bodies.""
I'm Dori O'Rourke, an avid senior athlete and senior sports proponent and I'm partnering with senior fitness specialist and senior sports expert, Kirsten Cummings to co-author this ground-breaking book designed to show senior athletes how to reset their bodies so they can enjoy a lifetime of sports and play. 
Kirsten and I have both been athletes our entire lives and we love sports, especially senior sports.  To see athletes get hurt and be forced to stop playing is heartbreaking to us ... especially when it could have been avoided! 
With your help, we can show senior athletes the 5 simple things they can do to get their bodies in a position to play for the rest of their lives. 
Playing sports isn't just for fun, the ability to move our bodies literally helps keep us alive.  When we stop moving, our bodies start dying.  That's why playing sports is one of the greatest ways to live a long, happy, healthy life.




HOW YOU CAN HELP


Contribute to the project - take advantage of any of the great perks we have listed on the right side of this page as our THANK YOU!


Spread the word - Help us get the word out about our campaign by telling all your friends and social media buddies.  Please send the website address (URL) of this IndieGoGo page with a heartfelt endorsement to all the people you know.  It will be a HUGE HELP!


Use the book as a fundraiser - If you're connected with any organizations that want to raise funds, contact us to discuss how we can TEAM UP!


Use the IndieGoGo share tools to make sharing EASY!


HOW WE’LL USE THE MONEY
Raising $2,500 is our starting point because that will cover the basic photos, cover design, illustrations, and printing costs.
We'd like to raise at least $10,000 though so we can get more detailed illustrations, print more copies, and build a website that includes BONUS VIDEOS for book readers. 
If our dreams were to really come true, we'd raise over $25,000 which would give us the money for a nationwide publicity campaign and the ability to help even more amazing seniors athletes! 
“People do not quit playing because they grow old; they grow old because they quit playing.”  ~ Oliver Wendell Holmes



DID YOU KNOW?

An American turns 50 every 7 seconds – that’s more than 12,500 new “seniors” every day (US Census)

77 million people were born between 1946 and 1964 – which is defined as the baby boomer era (US Census)

By 2015, people aged 50 and over will represent 45% of the US population (AARP)

82% of adults over 50 who use the internet research health and wellness online (ImmersionActive)

Life expectancy in the US is consistently increasing – people aged 65 and over have grown from 3 million in 1900 (4% of the population) to about 35 million in 2000 (12%), and experts estimate that more than 50 million Americans – about 17% of the population – will be 65 or older in 2020 (Wikipedia)


WHY SENIOR ATHLETES NEED THIS BOOK

Senior Athletes: Reset Your Body … or BUST!How to Reset Your Body Back to Its Natural State So You Can Enjoy a Lifetime of Sports and Play
Adults turning 50 can now look forward to playing sports for another 30, 40 or even 50 years. Isn't that amazing!
Unfortunately though, while it’s completely realistic for men and women to be able to enjoy playing sports and other recreational activities for their entire lives, many seniors won’t.
That’s because many seniors will find themselves limited by pain and injuries that will gradually get worse with time, forcing them to give up one sport and activity after another, in what appears to be the inevitable result of old age.
BUT, the truth is, most pain and injuries are NOT DUE TO OLD AGE, they’re the direct result of a body that has lost its ""natural position"" – something that is COMPLETELY PREVENTABLE given the right knowledge, training, and support.
As we get older, it’s not age that is causing our physical problems, it’s the daily activities of life that have gradually led our bodies to become more and more off track.
While our bodies do a masterful job of adapting and compensating, this can only last so long before one compensation after another eventually puts us into such a compromised position that pain and injury are the result. In other words ... we BUST!
The GREAT NEWS is, we can dramatically prevent pain, reduce injuries, and increase our recovery time by simply “resetting our bodies.”
In Senior Athletes: Reset Your Body … or BUST! we’re going to show senior athletes the warning signs they need to know about and provide the information they need to recover the alignment and balance they had when they were younger.
With this book, senior athletes will truly be able to look forward to enjoying a lifetime of sports and play!


THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!
Senior athletes are our passion and we’re committed to helping men and women senior athletes play sports for as long as they'd like. 
But, we couldn’t help all the senior athletes we want to help without your help.  So, from the depths of our hearts to yours, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU for joining our efforts and supporting this very worthwhile project

A healthy and beautiful boy, he was our pride and joy. Stephen had a normal childhood until he was 3 years old, when he was diagnosed with Morquio Syndrome. Our lives collapsed when he heard the news, but we were determined to make the best that Stephen could be. Stephen had to go through a number of surgeries to get his neck and head well supported on his body, his body did not develop the same way other children develop, due to his syndrome he has small stature, and his short neck became a problem when it came to his breathing. In 2001  while on vacation Stephen acquire pneumonia, he was hospitalized in July 4th  in Charlotte , NC, from there he was transferred to Hackensack , NJ (where we live). While in the hospital he suffered a stroke. The doctors' prognosis were not very good and they told me and his father to be prepared for the worse. He had to go through  another serie of surgeries including the tracheotomy to help him to breath and a surgery to remove the blood clot from his brain.  Stephen remained in coma until April 2002 when he finally woke up!!! Stephen was a warrior, he was a fighter, he was in love with life! He fought his syndrome, his pneumonia, the stroke and the doctors prognosis with all the strength of his being. To date Stephen remains on a respirator and since 2001 he has been wheelchair bound, but his spirit and love for life have not changed in one bit.  
Stephen has overcome a lot of obstacles in his life.
I want to establish this campaing for Stephen because he is in need of a minivan that is handicapped accessible, the aproximate price for this minivan is $55,000.00. Stephen also needs a bigger room to keep all of his medical equipment, (respirator, suction machine, oxigen generator, humidifier, etc). Extending his room would cost around $35,000.00. The rest of the money will be utilized to get a couple of the books that he writes edited and published. The impact of this campaing will have are: Stephen quality of life will improve because he will have more mobility around his room and he will be able to visit places where has never been before. The other impact is his book are published a lot of people will understand the many blessings they have in their lives. If the campaing doesn't reach the goal, we will use the amount we raise for one of his needs.
On behalf of Stephen and our family I want to thank each and everyone of you for your support and your generosity. We would like to ask you to share this campaing with your friends, family and co-workers.</div>","My name is Gloria Castano, I am the proud mother of Stephen Castano.

School of Medicine at Mount Sinai -  Help
people living with Parkinson’s disease to find hope. 


Caring for people with diseases as complex as Parkinson’s disease is
difficult when funding is limited. We are striving to help.  Dr. Ping-Yue Pan is an outstanding Research
Assistant Professor in the Neurology Department at Mount Sinai. She is
also the recipient of Lucien Cote Early Investigator Award by the Parkinson’s
Disease Foundation. Her research focuses on identifying signaling pathways that
are central to Parkinson’s disease using genetic animal models. Ping works
alongside with human geneticists, clinicians and talented research staff at
Mount Sinai and around the world for the goal of finding novel therapeutic
targets. 
Show your support to Ping’s research project on a newly identified
Parkinson’s disease mutation that can lead to effective early intervention.  Your generosity ensures that we will be
closer to finding meaningful therapies and even a cure for the disease.
Parkinson's - We're in This Together.
On behalf of all people living with Parkinson’s disease and their loved
ones—we thank you from the bottom of our hearts. *All your donations are tax deductible (section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code).
Mount Sinai’s highly
specialized and integrated model has allowed us to make some of the greatest
advances in Parkinson’s research and care.
Not only do our doctors and specialists work hand-in-hand with our scientists,
but they are also our researchers. At the Institute our neurologists are
Movement Disorder Specialists, Parkinson’s disease experts, and they work
collaboratively with scientific and clinical research teams within one holistic
environment. Critical observations and insights and highly qualified data from
our Clinical Center guide our laboratory and clinical researchers in their
efforts.

<p>Thanks for checking out my project. Together with your help we can change the way people today deal with the inconvenience of drinking protein shakes. After a workout at the gym or as a healthy meal replacement, there is finally a product that is easy and convenient to use. We’ve got the designs, flavors, sourced the WHEY protein, and found an American factory that is excited about growing this opportunity with us.... We just need $50,000 to get it going. Please support us at whatever level you're comfortable with. If you’ve got the time though, be sure to read the info below as well, it’s wordy but worth it. Thanks for your support. – Joel!</p>

<div>The HandShake Pouch™ provides consumers with user-friendly way to store and consume everyday beverages. These beverages may include protein shakes, meal replacements and/or any powder beverage that needs to be mixed and shaken before consumption. The patented pouch is a small, lightweight and disposable pouch pre-filled with delicious and nutritious whey protein powder. During or after workout, in the gym, office, at the airport, hotel room or anywhere else, the user just fills the pouch with water or milk, shakes the pouch for 30 seconds and enjoys his/her protein shake without messy blenders or shakers to wash.

<p><strong>REVOLUTIONIZING FITNESS</strong>.  What does this mean?  <strong>REFIT</strong> is a fitness <em>concept </em>that challenges the way society views fitness.....more than calorie burning...more than weight loss....more than perfectly toned bodies.  <strong>REFIT</strong> engages the whole person with a relationship-focused approach to fitness while using positive music and motivational dance choreography.  With the launch of our <strong>first-ever DVD</strong>, the <strong>REFIT</strong> team desires to impact the fitness community across the US.  We believe that fitness is for<em> everyone</em>, regardless of size, shape, age or fitness level.  REFIT is inspired by the CHOICE+CHANGE+IMPACT concept: small <em>choices</em> can lead to positive <em>changes</em>, which ultimately leads to inspirational <em>impact</em> in society. We've seen this time and time again and are inspired by the numerous stories of success via REFIT classes.</p>
<p>Finding positive, clean, and culturally relevant music is not an easy task. Furthermore, creating exciting choreography to this music can be equally challenging.....but REFIT has managed to accomplish both. Incorporating faith into our fitness program may pigeon-hole us into certain ""Christian-only"" segments of society. We reject that possibility and seek to demonstrate that faith-infused fitness can be culturally relevant, fitness-focused, and above all.....an exhilarating experience for ANYONE.</p>
<p><strong><em>YOUR SUPPORT helps us achieve this goal!</em></strong>  This DVD is a culmination of three years of tears, triumph, hopes and dreams.  We are asking for your help to makes these dreams become a reality! </p>
<p>BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!  If we achieve over our minimum goal of 5k, we're headed towards our bigger dream of launching a <strong>REFIT Facilitator program</strong>, which would allow individuals to instruct and impact classes in their own communities.  In order to make that program possible, we need a fully functioning website that would offer more user interaction and downloadable material capabilities. Raising $12,000 would get the entire project off the ground...and y'all, the potential of the faciliator program is tremendous!  Once again, it's your help that puts our dreams to flight!</p>

<p>We are raising money to build a permanent Disc Golf course in Detroit's largest city park, Belle Isle. Belle Isle was designed by Frederick Olmsted, who also designed central park in New York, and was once considered the gem of Detroit. It is a currently hugely underutilized space that sits at the crossroads of the region’s major freeways and is easily accessible to over a million people.</p>

<p>Disc Golf is a sport that is virtually free to play. A good course pulls in tens of thousands of visitors a year. The city of Detroit has a major void to fill in terms of recreational activities for young people. This would offer a place for the city’s youth to play as well as bring thousands of young people into the city. </p>
<p>The space that has been earmarked for the Disc Golf course on Belle Isle contains over 32 acres of land, a lake, a canal with a covered bridge, a gorgeous view of the city skyline. It has the potential to be turned into a world class course. </p>

<p>My name is Paul 'Sifu Boggie' Brighton.</p>
<p>I began Qi Gong/Chi Kung at the age of 11 years with my main Sifu (Teacher), Sifu Shun Mei Li and his brother Shun Po. I was taught the traditional Taoist/ Daoist (pronounced  DOW-IST) way, which is to learn to heal yourself, to learn to mediate and empower oneself and defend oneself first - then use these skills on others.  (to attack, protect or teach?)</p>
<p>For more than 30 years, I have learnt and continue to learn,  a vast range of Chi Kungs/Qi Gongs (Daoist, Tai Chi, Shaolin and Tibetan) for healing, meditation, self-empowerments, fitness, weight loss and self-defence. </p>
<p>Also, for over 19 years I have learnt four styles of Tai Chi Chuan for self-healing, self-empowerment and self-defence - the main one I teach is Wudang/Practical Tai Chi Chuan (Cheng Tin-hung lineage) where  my Sifu's are Dan Docherty and Richard Odell.</p>
<p>I have also learnt Shaolin Kung Fu and a Martial Art called Shun-Do for 30 years, which I now teach under Shaolin/Tai Chi Fitness.</p>
<p>I have studied many healing system since 1982. The first was Shun Dao healing system which is the healing side to the Martial system of Shun Do.</p>
<p>Since then I have also learnt and practised Traditional Chinese massage, Reiki (Eastern, Western, Crystal, Tibetan and Shun Styles), Chi Daoist Empowerments and Healing systems, Sun Healing systems, Tai Chi and Chi Kung healing systems and Reflexology, most of these for between 15 and 30 years.</p>
<p>I have studied Daoist and Buddhist philosophies for more than 30 years and can teach these under Taoist/Daoist Mentorship for business and personal use.  I have healed using many types of Reiki and other healing energies, as well as Chinese massage, reflexology and Shun-Dao massage for around 26 years and teach the Energy empowerments in the Energy Workshops and downloads.</p>
<p>I have taught for over 20 years from personal one-to-ones to groups of over 70 people, from 6 year olds to 98 year olds (my oldest ever student!).</p>
<p>I have taught both teachers and pupils in both public and private schools and have done countless health days for councils all over London, as well as businesses.</p>
<p>I have successfully run classes in companies to improve productivity and reduce absenteeism, and have taught groups at residential homes alongside running healing and massage treatments for businesses, homes and health days.</p>
<p>I am also a Universal Mentor for a Qi Gong system called Universal Hero Game and also in the last 5 years I have started Daoism workshops helping to show others better ways to empower their life.</p>
<p>I started  'The Way Of...' back in 2000 as 'The Way Of Healing ' and focused mainly on teaching and workshops though it became apparent to me that with the skills I had obtained I could help both businesses and individuals become the best they can be or even better. Since then with my partner we have gone from strength to strength.</p>
<p>I am also a Universal Mentor at Universal Hero’s under my friend and Chi brother and founder Andrew Morrissey.</p>
<p>As well as being a fellow vitality agent with my other Chi brother, Kyle Vialli, who I have known for a fair number of years, I also happily assist him with running some of his Vitality Events.</p>
<p>My other passions are ice and roller skating, cooking and baking (as I'm a former Baker and Chef of 18 years and have studied Daoist cooking for 15 years which I plan to teach in... The Way Of Food...), being near the sea and nature, and just enjoying life.</p>
<p>They call me 'Boggie' (Martial name meaning Chaos and Calmness) or sometimes 'Sifu' ( which means Farther/Teacher and one who take responsibility for your teachings). I am otherwise know in Daoist and Life Mentor circle's as Sifu Boggie the FUNkey Daoist or just Paul if you prefer!</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">About: My Empowering Mission...</span></strong></p>
<p>For the last 10 years I have been successfully teaching on part-time basis doing my workshops and classes while still working in full time job. I wish to now change that and my aim is to teach, heal and coach full time.</p>
<p>To offer workshops and classes in the UK on a full time basis to all who are interested including those who would normally not be in a position to afford it.</p>
<p>I will also create heavily subsidised classes/workshops for people with Autism and the Autistic spectrum, Diabetes and illnesses that are effected by auto immune and nervous system dysfunction which Tai Chi, Qi Gong/Chi Kung and Meditation are known through medical case studies to help and benefit...</p>
<p>By offering  1-2-1's online and online workshops as well as a multitude of video's and programs for business, sports, personal development, spiritual development, healing of oneself and others, care and healing of equine and other animals and pets, plus relaxation techniques, De-stressing techniques etc.</p>

<p>The funding will enable me to upgrade my download video's and produce more video's to the highest standard possible and also help me upgrade my website and reach as many people as possible and therefore reduce the cost of my services.</p>
<p>It will also help enhance my skills and programs to an even higher standard which can then be passed on to many others.</p>
<p>But, as a Buddhist saying goes ‘what goes round comes round’ I also believe you need to give, like for like.</p>
<p>So by donating funds to me for my Mission I will in return give you my knowledge and skills via my current means which are:</p>
<p>Download video's and online 1-2-1 sessions and programs.</p>
<p>These can be for you personally or you can give them to someone else as a unique gift.</p>
<p>Also another return is that I will happily promote you or your business to my 15000+ contacts on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, my website and fan page.</p>
<p>By helping fund my mission I will be able to help as many people as I possibly can while helping you, or maybe a friend and your business.</p>
<p> <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What I need and what you get in return:</span></strong></p>
<p>In total I need $73500 which would fund me for 18 months, allow me to create funded Autistic workshops etc. and also pay for the professional filming of my new online video's.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">This a breakdown of how the funds will be used:</span></strong></p>
<p>$77,000 will allow me to focus purely on setting up workshops, events, classes and 1-2-1's in the UK of Tai Chi, Qi Gong/Chi Kung, Reiki (5 different styles) and Daoist Chi empowerments/Attuning, self-massage techniques, Meditation, Daoist Life coaching, De-stressing techniques, and relaxation techniques etc.</p>
<p>It will also allow me to set up the funded workshops which are part of my giving back to others project.</p>
<p>It will allow me to set up as many funded workshops as possible, so I will be able to create as many types of workshops for people with different conditons and to do this possibly on a weekly basis over the next year.</p>
<p>Allow me to develop and present my online 1-2-1's and online workshops.</p>
<p>$3,000 will allow me to professionally film edit and produce over 18 hours of video footage that can become 1-2-1 videos of Tai chi, Qigong, Daoist life coaching, meditation, relaxation techniques...etc.</p>
<p>Like I have already said, if you are funding me I feel the need to do something in return...</p>
<p>So whether you send me $5, $20, $45, $50 or $500 I, in return, will share my knowledge and skills with you to empower your life, working, sporting, personal and or spiritual development and help enhance your mind, body and spirit in your work, rest and play via a number of video downloads, online programs both 7 day and 35 day, online 1-2-1's that I can use to share my skills with you on a personal level.</p>

<p>Paul (Sifu Boggie) Brighton</p>
<p> </p></div>","Short Summary
My name is Paul 'Sifu Boggie' Brighton.
I began Qi Gong/Chi Kung at the age of 11 years with my main Sifu (Teacher), Sifu Shun Mei Li and his brother Shun Po. I was taught the traditional Taoist/ Daoist (pronounced  DOW-IST) way, which is to learn to heal yourself, to learn to mediate and empower oneself and defend oneself first - then use these skills on others.  (to attack, protect or teach?)
For more than 30 years, I have learnt and continue to learn,  a vast range of Chi Kungs/Qi Gongs (Daoist, Tai Chi, Shaolin and Tibetan) for healing, meditation, self-empowerments, fitness, weight loss and self-defence. 
Also, for over 19 years I have learnt four styles of Tai Chi Chuan for self-healing, self-empowerment and self-defence - the main one I teach is Wudang/Practical Tai Chi Chuan (Cheng Tin-hung lineage) where  my Sifu's are Dan Docherty and Richard Odell.
I have also learnt Shaolin Kung Fu and a Martial Art called Shun-Do for 30 years, which I now teach under Shaolin/Tai Chi Fitness.
I have studied many healing system since 1982. The first was Shun Dao healing system which is the healing side to the Martial system of Shun Do.
Since then I have also learnt and practised Traditional Chinese massage, Reiki (Eastern, Western, Crystal, Tibetan and Shun Styles), Chi Daoist Empowerments and Healing systems, Sun Healing systems, Tai Chi and Chi Kung healing systems and Reflexology, most of these for between 15 and 30 years.
I have studied Daoist and Buddhist philosophies for more than 30 years and can teach these under Taoist/Daoist Mentorship for business and personal use.  I have healed using many types of Reiki and other healing energies, as well as Chinese massage, reflexology and Shun-Dao massage for around 26 years and teach the Energy empowerments in the Energy Workshops and downloads.
I have taught for over 20 years from personal one-to-ones to groups of over 70 people, from 6 year olds to 98 year olds (my oldest ever student!).
I have taught both teachers and pupils in both public and private schools and have done countless health days for councils all over London, as well as businesses.
I have successfully run classes in companies to improve productivity and reduce absenteeism, and have taught groups at residential homes alongside running healing and massage treatments for businesses, homes and health days.
I am also a Universal Mentor for a Qi Gong system called Universal Hero Game and also in the last 5 years I have started Daoism workshops helping to show others better ways to empower their life.
I started  'The Way Of...' back in 2000 as 'The Way Of Healing ' and focused mainly on teaching and workshops though it became apparent to me that with the skills I had obtained I could help both businesses and individuals become the best they can be or even better. Since then with my partner we have gone from strength to strength.
I am also a Universal Mentor at Universal Hero’s under my friend and Chi brother and founder Andrew Morrissey.
As well as being a fellow vitality agent with my other Chi brother, Kyle Vialli, who I have known for a fair number of years, I also happily assist him with running some of his Vitality Events.
My other passions are ice and roller skating, cooking and baking (as I'm a former Baker and Chef of 18 years and have studied Daoist cooking for 15 years which I plan to teach in... The Way Of Food...), being near the sea and nature, and just enjoying life.
They call me 'Boggie' (Martial name meaning Chaos and Calmness) or sometimes 'Sifu' ( which means Farther/Teacher and one who take responsibility for your teachings). I am otherwise know in Daoist and Life Mentor circle's as Sifu Boggie the FUNkey Daoist or just Paul if you prefer!
About: My Empowering Mission...
For the last 10 years I have been successfully teaching on part-time basis doing my workshops and classes while still working in full time job. I wish to now change that and my aim is to teach, heal and coach full time.
To offer workshops and classes in the UK on a full time basis to all who are interested including those who would normally not be in a position to afford it.
I will also create heavily subsidised classes/workshops for people with Autism and the Autistic spectrum, Diabetes and illnesses that are effected by auto immune and nervous system dysfunction which Tai Chi, Qi Gong/Chi Kung and Meditation are known through medical case studies to help and benefit...
By offering  1-2-1's online and online workshops as well as a multitude of video's and programs for business, sports, personal development, spiritual development, healing of oneself and others, care and healing of equine and other animals and pets, plus relaxation techniques, De-stressing techniques etc.
How you can help me help others:
The funding will enable me to upgrade my download video's and produce more video's to the highest standard possible and also help me upgrade my website and reach as many people as possible and therefore reduce the cost of my services.
It will also help enhance my skills and programs to an even higher standard which can then be passed on to many others.
But, as a Buddhist saying goes ‘what goes round comes round’ I also believe you need to give, like for like.
So by donating funds to me for my Mission I will in return give you my knowledge and skills via my current means which are:
Download video's and online 1-2-1 sessions and programs.
These can be for you personally or you can give them to someone else as a unique gift.
Also another return is that I will happily promote you or your business to my 15000+ contacts on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, my website and fan page.
By helping fund my mission I will be able to help as many people as I possibly can while helping you, or maybe a friend and your business.
 What I need and what you get in return:
In total I need $73500 which would fund me for 18 months, allow me to create funded Autistic workshops etc. and also pay for the professional filming of my new online video's.
This a breakdown of how the funds will be used:
$77,000 will allow me to focus purely on setting up workshops, events, classes and 1-2-1's in the UK of Tai Chi, Qi Gong/Chi Kung, Reiki (5 different styles) and Daoist Chi empowerments/Attuning, self-massage techniques, Meditation, Daoist Life coaching, De-stressing techniques, and relaxation techniques etc.
It will also allow me to set up the funded workshops which are part of my giving back to others project.
It will allow me to set up as many funded workshops as possible, so I will be able to create as many types of workshops for people with different conditons and to do this possibly on a weekly basis over the next year.
Allow me to develop and present my online 1-2-1's and online workshops.
$3,000 will allow me to professionally film edit and produce over 18 hours of video footage that can become 1-2-1 videos of Tai chi, Qigong, Daoist life coaching, meditation, relaxation techniques...etc.
Like I have already said, if you are funding me I feel the need to do something in return...
So whether you send me $5, $20, $45, $50 or $500 I, in return, will share my knowledge and skills with you to empower your life, working, sporting, personal and or spiritual development and help enhance your mind, body and spirit in your work, rest and play via a number of video downloads, online programs both 7 day and 35 day, online 1-2-1's that I can use to share my skills with you on a personal level.

<p>The cure is in the love handles: help
Florentin fight Parkinson's disease with stem cells from his own body and
overcome the obstructionist policies of the FDA</p>
<p>Who is Florentin?</p>
<p>Florentin Krause is 63 years old and
lives in Richmond, California. As an adventurous 19-year old with a dream of
earning a doctorate in the US, he came to California from Germany some 44 years
ago and entered graduate school in physical chemistry at UC Berkeley. Florentin
fell in love with California, its mixture of cultures, its natural beauty and
possibility for outdoors activities, and its dynamic progressive social and
environmental movements. He felt at home on his skis in the snowy Sierra
Nevada, and he enthusiastically kayaked California's rivers and coasts. He
chose to stay.</p>
<p>Florentin's graduate studies were
supported by grants from US and German foundations. Upon receiving his
doctorate, he endeavored to repay his debt to society by choosing a path of
environment-and public interest-oriented research and activism over a better-paying career in industry.</p>
<p>Florentin has a knack for explaining
complex themes with humor and inspires people with his clarity of vision. Early
in his work he led the development of a national energy plan for Germany that showed a path
for simultaneously phasing out nuclear power while also substantially reducing
fossil fuel emissions. The plan, known in Germany as Energiewende, was first
adopted by the Green party there and is now the term used for Germany's
official energy program under Chancellor Merkel.</p>
<p>In subsequent years, Florentin became a
leading international advocate of climate friendly energy policies. He
participated in UN scientific panels on global warming and was instrumental in
developing the concept of a global warming limit. His testimonies in
congressional and parliamentary hearings in the US and Europe were a
frequent thorn in the side of the fossil fuel lobby.</p>
<p>Over time, Florentin became preoccupied
with the fact that human beings tend to act in self-destructive ways even when
faced with clear evidence of existential threats to humanity. He deepened his
studies of psychology and spirituality, which resulted in a shift of personal
focus towards consciousness-raising groups practicing inquiry into the deeper truth of one's
personal experience. It is his wish and intention to continue working in this
capacity for many more years.</p>
<p>Enter Parkinson's</p>
<p>In 2005, Florentin noticed a recurring
tremor in his arm after exercise. When he went to see his doctor, he was
diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. According to his doctors, this diagnosis
meant an unstoppable descent into ever greater stiffness, slowness, tremoring
and shaking, loss of balance, and unsteady, precarious gait. Eventually,
walking from the car to the store would become a major ordeal. Putting on a
shirt might take 15 min., and typing or using an iPhone would become a totally
frustrating affair as his fingers kept tapping uncontrollably. At the same
time, his hand writing ability would become greatly diminished.</p>
<p>Add to this a progressive weakening of
voice, freezing of facial expression, and chronic muscular pain, and one might
begin to understand why one Parkinson patient said: “this disease is like
getting buried alive in your own body.” </p>
<p>To make things worse, the disease can
also cause depression and affect cognitive functioning, producing brain fog,
difficulty calling up words, slowness of speech and thinking, and loss of
memory. As such, the disease is a threat to Florentin’s livelihood and
continued ability to work. Given Florentin's lifelong enjoyment of the outdoors
and all of sports like skiing, diving, and kayaking, the loss of mobility is
strongly felt by him.</p>
<p>Conventional medicine has no cure</p>
<p>Conventional medicine has no cure for
Parkinson's disease. The last significant pharmaceutical innovation in treating
the disease occurred some 40 years ago. Available drugs do nothing more than
temporarily mask the symptoms. Available medications eventually lose their
effectiveness and often end up producing the very symptoms of Parkinson's disease
as side effects. The uncontrollable weaving and bobbing and writhing seen in
many patients and made notorious by Michael J Fox are not a symptom of the
disease, but a side effect of the medications.</p>
<p>What to do?</p>
<p>Throughout his illness, Florentin has not
only relied on the drugs of conventional medicine, but has also vigorously
pursued alternative medicine approaches including exercise, diet, acupuncture,
supplements and surgeries for improving the blood flow to his brain. This has slowed his progression substantially,
but after 6 years on the standard pharmaceutical medications, these drugs have
begun to lose their effectiveness, and it is time to chart a new course.</p>
<p>One non-drug treatment is implantation of
a pair of electrodes deep into the brain, the so-called brain pacemaker.
Florentin's two neurology doctors are at odds with each other over whether to
recommend this intervention. The procedure is usually recommended as a last
resort. It has a 1% failure rate, which is 10 to 100 times greater than that
for routine heart surgeries. When the operation fails, one consequence can be
loss of cognitive functioning and speech. Even when the surgery succeeds, the
leads to the electrodes can break or cause infections.</p>
<p>The way to go: adult stem cells from your
own body</p>
<p>For all these reasons, Florentin has been
looking elsewhere. He has researched the rapidly evolving field of adult stem
cell therapy, and has concluded that this therapy offers a much safer, health
promoting alternative based on his own body's intelligence. </p>
<p>The approach consists of extracting fat
from one's belly region (specifically, Florentin's love handles), separating
the stem cells in the fat with a centrifuge, separating the most potent cell
lines (so-called mesenchymal cells), and growing these for several weeks to a
population of several hundred million. Once this large number is achieved, the
cells are ready for intravenous injection.</p>
<p>The injected cells have a homing
capacity. They pick up on the presence of certain proteins that get produced by
damaged cells in the brain and other organs and body systems. The stem cells
migrate to these sites and secrete various kinds of growth factor proteins that
have the effect of repairing cells. They also promote new growth of neurons and
other types of cells. Specifically, the injected cells can repair the part of
the brain affected by Parkinson's disease.</p>
<p>Increased efficacy</p>
<p>Adult stem cell therapy is now ready for
prime time. Until recently, the reported efficacy of adult stem cell treatment
was about one third, meaning one out of three patients experienced significant
and lasting improvements in their symptoms, such as reductions in tremors, etc.
</p>
<p>With the introduction of the much more
potent mesenchymal stem cells, and by growing the cells so they can be used in
large numbers, the efficacy has risen to more than 90%. In effect, this advanced form pushes the treatment into the most effective portion of its dose-response curve. Also,
several clinical trials have shown the safety of using one's own adult fat derived stem
cells.</p>
<p>Results reported by patients </p>
<p>One patient Florentin spoke to in person reported
these results:</p>
<p>Barely audible, whispering voice – gone;
inability to get up from the chair without use of arms – gone; shaking in his
right arm – gone; mask-like, frozen face – gone; inability to lie on one side
due to chronic pain – gone; arthritic condition in foot – gone. These benefits
all occurred within the 1st month after treatment and have persisted so far for
one and a half years. His observations were confirmed by his neurologist.</p>
<p>The potency of advanced adult stem cell
treatment is further illustrated in a YouTube video about an evangelist
in his 70s who had become so ill with Parkinson's that he got ready to die. He
had lost his voice and his ability to stand and walk, could no longer perform
his daily living tasks and was largely bedridden and in serious pain all the
time. In this very severe case, a total of 12 injections were applied over the
course of one year. The video shows this man walking down the aisle toward the
podium of a large congregation hall with upright posture and a spring in his
step and addressing his audience with a strong voice and a demeanor that made
him appear 10 years younger. Here is the link:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ83VCFe-8U"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ83VCFe-8U</a></p>
<p>A big hurdle: the FDA </p>
<p>In view of these improved results,
Florentin has decided it is time to get treated. Unfortunately, the Food and Drug
Administration has made this advanced form of stem cell treatment illegal and
therefor<b>e</b> unavailable in the US. The
reasoning of the FDA is that as soon as stem cells taken from the body are in
any way manipulated before being re-injected, the stem cells become a drug subject
to the same multiyear, multimillion dollar testing requirements applied in the
case of pharmaceuticals. The minimum time horizon for overcoming these
regulatory hurdles is 5-10 years or so. Like many patients, Florentin cannot wait that long.<br/></p><p>The current treatment of Parkinson's
disease is a moneymaker for big Pharma. The FDA seems to be more
interested in protecting the pharmaceutical industry than in advancing the best treatment for patients. One result is that presently, no insurance company covers
state-of-the-art stem cell treatments, and people like Florentin are forced to
have the injections done abroad. Fortunately, highly competent clinics with US
trained doctors do exist in other countries, however, US patients are forced to
bear the considerable additional costs of medical travel abroad, which is all the
more burdensome when a travel companion is needed.</p>
<p>What Florentin's treatment will look like</p>
<p>The company Florentin will use is called
Celltex. Its headquarters are in Houston, Texas, where adult stem cells are
grown and banked. Injections are done in modern clinics located in Cancun and
Guadalajara, Mexico. The total number of cells used in the treatment is between
500 million and 1 billion or more. To avoid overwhelming the body, the total dose is broken down into multiple injections spaced one to
several weeks apart. The minimum treatment consists of three injections, with a
recommended number of five in Florentin's case.</p>
<p>The improvements to be expected from the
treatment include reductions in all the symptoms described above, though which
symptoms improve the most varies greatly from individual to individual. Effects take up to 6 months to show up. To
quantify improvements from the treatment, a Parkinson's rating scale will be
administered before and after the treatment. Any reduction in the rating scale
after injection will mean an improvement and can be expressed as a percentage.
Also a video recording will be made before and after.</p>
<p>Benefits beyond Florentin's personal
health</p>
<p>Florentin’s friends and colleagues not
only wish to help him get better personally, but they also know that Florentin
will benefit many others with his ability to write and speak eloquently in
public fora including his Yahoo group about this new stem cell treatment and
its scientific foundation and FDA status. Donations to Florentin’s campaign
will thus also be a contribution to the well-being of other Parkinson patients.<span>  </span></p>
<p>This orientation also informs the choice of
perks offered by the campaign. One of the perks is a phone conversation with
Florentin in which contributors can ask any and all questions about his
treatment experience. Another perk consists of a report with the before and
after test results  and a description of the clinic and staff.</p>
<p>The costs</p>
<p>The charge for extracting, growing and
banking the cells is $6000.<span>  The package
price for 5 injections is $50,000. To receive these injections, Florentin will
need to travel to the clinic twice, respectively for a 16 day stay and then a 9
day stay. The costs of travel for himself and a caretaker companion is $4000
for the two trips. The total cost is thus $60,000.</span></p>
<p>Florentin has already $16,000, which
cover the cell preparation and one injection. He needs to raise $44,000 to pay for his
treatment, plus indiegogo fees.<span> <br/></span></p>
<p>If
donations should fall short of this goal, funds will be applied to pay for
a lesser number of injections, and a new campaign will be pursued to cover the
full number of injections.</p><p>A note to Florentin's students</p><p>This fundraising campaign is not a campaign of the Ridhwan Foundation or the Ridhwan School, or endorsed by them. It is not intended to solicit donations from Florentin's Ridhwan students. Students can donate if they do so anonymously. Any contribution listed on the site that is recognized as originating from one of Florentin's students will be returned by the Team, and any associated perks will be canceled. The Team also asks that contributions from Florentin's teacher colleagues be made anonymously. These procedures have been adopted to protect and support the integrity of the teacher-student relationship.<br/></p>

strongly felt by him.
Conventional medicine has no cure
Conventional medicine has no cure for
Parkinson's disease. The last significant pharmaceutical innovation in treating
the disease occurred some 40 years ago. Available drugs do nothing more than
temporarily mask the symptoms. Available medications eventually lose their
effectiveness and often end up producing the very symptoms of Parkinson's disease
as side effects. The uncontrollable weaving and bobbing and writhing seen in
many patients and made notorious by Michael J Fox are not a symptom of the
disease, but a side effect of the medications.
What to do?
Throughout his illness, Florentin has not
only relied on the drugs of conventional medicine, but has also vigorously
pursued alternative medicine approaches including exercise, diet, acupuncture,
supplements and surgeries for improving the blood flow to his brain. This has slowed his progression substantially,
but after 6 years on the standard pharmaceutical medications, these drugs have
begun to lose their effectiveness, and it is time to chart a new course.
One non-drug treatment is implantation of
a pair of electrodes deep into the brain, the so-called brain pacemaker.
Florentin's two neurology doctors are at odds with each other over whether to
recommend this intervention. The procedure is usually recommended as a last
resort. It has a 1% failure rate, which is 10 to 100 times greater than that
for routine heart surgeries. When the operation fails, one consequence can be
loss of cognitive functioning and speech. Even when the surgery succeeds, the
leads to the electrodes can break or cause infections.
The way to go: adult stem cells from your
own body
For all these reasons, Florentin has been
looking elsewhere. He has researched the rapidly evolving field of adult stem
cell therapy, and has concluded that this therapy offers a much safer, health
promoting alternative based on his own body's intelligence. 
The approach consists of extracting fat
from one's belly region (specifically, Florentin's love handles), separating
the stem cells in the fat with a centrifuge, separating the most potent cell
lines (so-called mesenchymal cells), and growing these for several weeks to a
population of several hundred million. Once this large number is achieved, the
cells are ready for intravenous injection.
The injected cells have a homing
capacity. They pick up on the presence of certain proteins that get produced by
damaged cells in the brain and other organs and body systems. The stem cells
migrate to these sites and secrete various kinds of growth factor proteins that
have the effect of repairing cells. They also promote new growth of neurons and
other types of cells. Specifically, the injected cells can repair the part of
the brain affected by Parkinson's disease.
Increased efficacy
Adult stem cell therapy is now ready for
prime time. Until recently, the reported efficacy of adult stem cell treatment
was about one third, meaning one out of three patients experienced significant
and lasting improvements in their symptoms, such as reductions in tremors, etc.

With the introduction of the much more
potent mesenchymal stem cells, and by growing the cells so they can be used in
large numbers, the efficacy has risen to more than 90%. In effect, this advanced form pushes the treatment into the most effective portion of its dose-response curve. Also,
several clinical trials have shown the safety of using one's own adult fat derived stem
cells.
Results reported by patients 
One patient Florentin spoke to in person reported
these results:
Barely audible, whispering voice – gone;
inability to get up from the chair without use of arms – gone; shaking in his
right arm – gone; mask-like, frozen face – gone; inability to lie on one side
due to chronic pain – gone; arthritic condition in foot – gone. These benefits
all occurred within the 1st month after treatment and have persisted so far for
one and a half years. His observations were confirmed by his neurologist.
The potency of advanced adult stem cell
treatment is further illustrated in a YouTube video about an evangelist
in his 70s who had become so ill with Parkinson's that he got ready to die. He
had lost his voice and his ability to stand and walk, could no longer perform
his daily living tasks and was largely bedridden and in serious pain all the
time. In this very severe case, a total of 12 injections were applied over the
course of one year. The video shows this man walking down the aisle toward the
podium of a large congregation hall with upright posture and a spring in his
step and addressing his audience with a strong voice and a demeanor that made
him appear 10 years younger. Here is the link:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ83VCFe-8U
A big hurdle: the FDA 
In view of these improved results,
Florentin has decided it is time to get treated. Unfortunately, the Food and Drug
Administration has made this advanced form of stem cell treatment illegal and
therefore unavailable in the US. The
reasoning of the FDA is that as soon as stem cells taken from the body are in
any way manipulated before being re-injected, the stem cells become a drug subject
to the same multiyear, multimillion dollar testing requirements applied in the
case of pharmaceuticals. The minimum time horizon for overcoming these
regulatory hurdles is 5-10 years or so. Like many patients, Florentin cannot wait that long.The current treatment of Parkinson's
disease is a moneymaker for big Pharma. The FDA seems to be more
interested in protecting the pharmaceutical industry than in advancing the best treatment for patients. One result is that presently, no insurance company covers
state-of-the-art stem cell treatments, and people like Florentin are forced to
have the injections done abroad. Fortunately, highly competent clinics with US
trained doctors do exist in other countries, however, US patients are forced to
bear the considerable additional costs of medical travel abroad, which is all the
more burdensome when a travel companion is needed.
What Florentin's treatment will look like
The company Florentin will use is called
Celltex. Its headquarters are in Houston, Texas, where adult stem cells are
grown and banked. Injections are done in modern clinics located in Cancun and
Guadalajara, Mexico. The total number of cells used in the treatment is between
500 million and 1 billion or more. To avoid overwhelming the body, the total dose is broken down into multiple injections spaced one to
several weeks apart. The minimum treatment consists of three injections, with a
recommended number of five in Florentin's case.
The improvements to be expected from the
treatment include reductions in all the symptoms described above, though which
symptoms improve the most varies greatly from individual to individual. Effects take up to 6 months to show up. To
quantify improvements from the treatment, a Parkinson's rating scale will be
administered before and after the treatment. Any reduction in the rating scale
after injection will mean an improvement and can be expressed as a percentage.
Also a video recording will be made before and after.
Benefits beyond Florentin's personal
health
Florentin’s friends and colleagues not
only wish to help him get better personally, but they also know that Florentin
will benefit many others with his ability to write and speak eloquently in
public fora including his Yahoo group about this new stem cell treatment and
its scientific foundation and FDA status. Donations to Florentin’s campaign
will thus also be a contribution to the well-being of other Parkinson patients.  
This orientation also informs the choice of
perks offered by the campaign. One of the perks is a phone conversation with
Florentin in which contributors can ask any and all questions about his
treatment experience. Another perk consists of a report with the before and
after test results  and a description of the clinic and staff.
The costs
The charge for extracting, growing and
banking the cells is $6000.  The package
price for 5 injections is $50,000. To receive these injections, Florentin will
need to travel to the clinic twice, respectively for a 16 day stay and then a 9
day stay. The costs of travel for himself and a caretaker companion is $4000
for the two trips. The total cost is thus $60,000.
Florentin has already $16,000, which
cover the cell preparation and one injection. He needs to raise $44,000 to pay for his
treatment, plus indiegogo fees. 
If
donations should fall short of this goal, funds will be applied to pay for
a lesser number of injections, and a new campaign will be pursued to cover the
full number of injections.A note to Florentin's studentsThis fundraising campaign is not a campaign of the Ridhwan Foundation or the Ridhwan School, or endorsed by them. It is not intended to solicit donations from Florentin's Ridhwan students. Students can donate if they do so anonymously. Any contribution listed on the site that is recognized as originating from one of Florentin's students will be returned by the Team, and any associated perks will be canceled. The Team also asks that contributions from Florentin's teacher colleagues be made anonymously. These procedures have been adopted to protect and support the integrity of the teacher-student relationship.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Hello,

My name is Oliver and I would like to introduce you to my dear friends, Donna and Joe.  They are truly remarkable  people… for so many reasons that I couldn’t even begin to list them all. Consider the following...

They are more in love and more loving than any couple I’ve ever know.  They’ve been married for 44 years and their love grows exponentially deeper each year… each day.  Just being near them awakens the love and the joy in everyone around them. 

They adopted (or took guardianship of) 17 very special children.

They founded and still direct The RADIANCE HEALING INSTITUTE (a nonprofit organization) which teaches people to love the Divine by loving themselves... and therefore others.

They created SPIRIT OF UNCONDITIONAL LOVE (see www.spiritofunconditionallove.com) which produces a daily recording called “Five Minutes of Love - Five Minutes of Hope. (Please check it out… It is amazing.)

They sponsor a project called CELEBRATIONS OF LOVE through which they give support to individuals and families in which they themselves experienced abuse or neglect or trauma when they were children... and are now learning to live functional, joyous, creative lives that make a difference.

And… they have a passion for working with others who are differently-abled as both Donna and Joe are “disabled.”

Donna was born with Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome.  She has spent most of her life partially paralyzed, in wheelchairs and on oxygen machines… at times even unable to hold her head up or breathe on her own.  

And...Joe was exposed to Agent Orange in Viet Nam and is now in kidney failure.  

Being ill hasn’t stopped them at all.  They continue to live lives of service every single day…Nothing could stop that.   












   
When they were raising their children, they had a sign on the front door that read:
""PREPARE THYSELF TO BE PART OF A MIRACLE""
It worked. People came into their home conscious of the fact that they wanted - and yes - even needed, to be part of a miracle.
And now, I am inviting you to be part of their miracle…

Five months ago when they first learned of Joe's kidney failure, they suddenly realized that they would need to move away from the home they love so deeply in order to get the medical care that is needed. They had no idea how expenses would be covered.
But in Donna’s words: We are so blessed… so in awe.  Source has provided so many miracles. We have home, we have food, we have love. Every single day we are taken care of.  The only thing we need arefunds for medical bills and medicines, travel expenses and alternative treatments such as acupuncture, chiropractics and physical therapy.” 

If you feel moved to do so – would you please consider helping my dear friends who have spent their lives helping the world to be a more joyous, loving place? 


Every dollar is a sign that you too believe in the power of Love... You too are prepared to be part of a miracle. 


With great gratitude,


Oliver

<p></p></div>","While preparing for my first deployment to Iraq, many of my unit's veteran leaders were forced to accept early retirement or medical discharge. After returning to the U.S., more decided to leave rather than face another deployment and separation from their families. This left younger, less experienced soldiers like me to pick up the responsibilities of training without the mentorship and guidance of our veteran leaders. Our first range qualification resulted in only 28% of the unit's 350 soldiers qualifying on their individual weapons.  We had motivated soldiers, but we didn't have enough leaders capable of training them.With this in mind, I created the Deadeye Coach to give marksmen the data and feedback they need to fix fundamental flaws in their firing and to ensure that their next shot counts. Created as a way to help soldiers on the range, Deadeye Coach has evolved to address the needs of hunters in the field and law enforcement.At 300 meters, a barrel deflection of less than one degree can be the difference between a clean kill and a two kilometer hike after a wounded animal. The science of marksmanship deals with targets hundreds of meters away, projectiles moving faster than sound, and weapon movements measured in millimeters. The average shooter, focused on her target, is not concerned with the fine points of marksmanship, she needs tools that can identify error and provide specific feedback that can be applied immediately. Basic rifle marksmanship is based on four fundamentals:
Steady Position
Site Picture
Breath Control
Trigger Squeeze
Flaws in these fundamentals are very hard to detect, even for experts who rely on observation to provide subjective feedback; for a novice these flaws are nearly impossible to detect. Because of technological limits and a general lack of innovation in the marksmanship industry, we are left with an array of ineffective, and often detrimental gadgets. With advances in sensor technology brought about by the wide spread use of smart phones, combined with expert knowledge of marksmanship and a large amount of innovation in data analysis, Deadeye Marksmanship is able to offer the quantitative data of high-end training devices with the expert analysis and feedback of an experienced coach in an inexpensive device that is durable enough for live fire.Deadeye Coach is a small weapon mounted device that detects weapon movement in the fractions of a second prior to discharge. It is in these moments prior to firing when poor trigger squeeze and breath control can cause a deflection in the weapon's intended trajectory. The Deadeye Coach analyzes this data and transmits feedback wirelessly to your phone or mobile device.Concise feedback can be viewed quickly on a shot-by-shot basis or viewed as a series, shot grouping, qualification event, or historical breakdown. Your shot data can be kept on your device, transmitted to your home computer, or shared with your friends via Facebook, Instagram, or text. Features will also include progress tracking, leader-boards, games, and anything else we can come up with to make the device more useful, functional, and fun.Matthew Gonzales, Co-founder & CEO                                                                        Matt previously worked for The University of Texas at San Antonio developing curriculum content and educational programming for the Department of Entrepreneurship and Technology Management while finishing his MBA in Management of Technology. @OmNomAGonzMatthew Jackson, Co-founder & CFO                                                                          Is a graduate of the University of Texas at San Antonio and worked in its Small Business Development Center advising local entrepreneurs and business owners.

My name is Nina Bruce. I have taken over this campaign on behalf of my husband Chris and our families and immediate friends who have urged me to do so. They, like me, can no longer afford the kidney dialysis treatment he so desperately needs  and we have exhausted our own funds.
Chris's Story
Chris before his kidney failure:


Chris retired three in 2011 having worked all his life from the age of twenty and was looking forward to a quiet life in retirement. Unfortunately he was diagnosed as having Type 2 Diabetes and End Stage Kidney Failure after he had twice collapsed and gone into a coma. After two months in hospital he is back home but requires regular kidney dialysis which is very expensive and Chris has a very small pension, but no medical insurance and his savings have been wiped out by his medical bills. Chris is a fighter and is doing everything he can to help himself but he needs the dialysis treatment to keep him alive.  
In better days Chris was an active contributor to charity including putting 6 students through university. He now needs your help.
Chris writes in the hope of making a little
money with his recipe and humor books and autobiography but without the income
to support the dialysis he desperately needs he will slowly lose his fight
against this incurable disease.

Two lymph nodes also tested positive. A very stressful February included a battery of other tests--Pet Scan, additional biopsies looking for metastasis, and the possibility of Inflammatory Breast Cancer which is more  aggressive and involves a poor prognosis. All came back negative! WHEW!</span></p>

She is doing well at the time of this posting and has had mostly minor side effects. She has mainly had nausea and bone pain from the white blood cell booster shots (seven between every chemo treatment). She tires more easily and her hair has fallen out. She has been given a prescription for a “cranial prosthesis” (wig) but it doesn’t seem her style (see accompanying pictures). Hats and scarves will become the latest fashion statement!</span></p>

She is doing all she can to help this healing path.</span></p>

She is continuing to work, but only part time. Being self employed means there is no such thing as sick days, and NO sick pay. She anticipates not being back to full time work until November, depending largely on when and how extensive the surgery may be. Her income has been severely reduced, at a time when we can least afford it. </span></p>

That amount seems small compared to the tens of thousands of dollars this journey will cost, but its a dollar figure that has sent us into a financial tail spin.  We are being proactive and have made arrangements for $50.00/month payments to the five entities involved: Johnson Cancer Center, Mercy Hospital, Muskegon Surgical Associates, anesthesiology, and radiology.  </span></p>

We reached our initial goal of $2300.00 within three days of launching our campaign. We are very grateful!  These funds will be used for the payment plan set with the five medical establishments associated with Amy's treatments, only through October 2014.  This campaign is open through April 30, in hopes that we can raise additional funds to pay the total costs of $6,350.00 not covered by insurance. Any additional contributions to this campaign will be applied directly to those medical establishments. Thank you!

Read on:

Dear Friends and Family,
At the beginning of February, Amy was diagnosed with Stage 2, breast cancer, Invasive Ductal Carcinoma. Two lymph nodes also tested positive. A very stressful February included a battery of other tests--Pet Scan, additional biopsies looking for metastasis, and the possibility of Inflammatory Breast Cancer which is more  aggressive and involves a poor prognosis. All came back negative! WHEW!
She has started chemo treatments, having had three so far, and will receive treatments through the end of July, and surgery, possible mastectomy, in the beginning of September. She is doing well at the time of this posting and has had mostly minor side effects. She has mainly had nausea and bone pain from the white blood cell booster shots (seven between every chemo treatment). She tires more easily and her hair has fallen out. She has been given a prescription for a “cranial prosthesis” (wig) but it doesn’t seem her style (see accompanying pictures). Hats and scarves will become the latest fashion statement!
True to Amy's nature, she dove into research about other alternative methods of treatment, and has found some fascinating research, especially on the use of curcumin, the active ingredient of turmeric. She is doing all she can to help this healing path.
Besides the emotional and physical stress, we are also experiencing the severe financial stress that this diagnosis brings. She is continuing to work, but only part time. Being self employed means there is no such thing as sick days, and NO sick pay. She anticipates not being back to full time work until November, depending largely on when and how extensive the surgery may be. Her income has been severely reduced, at a time when we can least afford it. 
Amy has catastrophic insurance with Blue Care Network with a $6,350 total we have to pay ourselves. That amount seems small compared to the tens of thousands of dollars this journey will cost, but its a dollar figure that has sent us into a financial tail spin.  We are being proactive and have made arrangements for $50.00/month payments to the five entities involved: Johnson Cancer Center, Mercy Hospital, Muskegon Surgical Associates, anesthesiology, and radiology.  
 We are asking for your help! These five new monthly payments ($250 per month), compounded by the costs of travel to medical appointments, and Amy’s loss of income are an additional financial burden on our budget, and we are struggling to make ends meet. We are requesting your help to make those medical payments each month. Your gift will ease the stress on Amy during this difficult time of treatments. 
With Amy’s expected loss of eight months of work, we have established an initial need of $2,300 to cover our most pressing expenses. We are required to begin our monthly payment plans right away, so this Indiegogo fundraiser campaign will only be open for a short period of time. If you are so moved to contribute, we would need your donation by April 30, 2014.
Friends are also organizing a local fundraiser event to support Amy’s Healing Journey which will be on May 4, 2014.  Please contact us if you would like to donate food, time, silent auction items, or participate in any way.
Our hearts are open to this healing journey.  The doctors are very confident that this cancer can be eradicated, and Amy is convinced that she will be healthier than ever when all is done. Your financial help along this healing journey is held with deepest love and gratitude!  Thank you!  Amy and Barb",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>En la noche del 21 de agosto, después de
salir del cine juntos en el centro de Cabo San Lucas y regresar a mi coche para
ir a disfrutar de una cena juntos, mi novio Eduardo Benítez fue brutalmente
atacado en el bulevar principal en frente del centro comercial Puerto Paraíso.

imprudente quien nos estaba bloqueando totalmente con su coche estacionado, fuimos
rápidamente rodeados por un grupo de sus compañeros de trabajo del bar en
frente del mall, y estaban acercándose, cerrando el circulo.  Con el fin de protegerme y distraerlos, Eduardo
salió corriendo tan rápido como sea posible en la dirección opuesta, y fue
inmediatamente seguido a toda velocidad por unos de los tipos por la banqueta y
a través del tráfico, y por fin a través del boulevard, donde aun mas hombres

con un bárbaro arma, hasta dejarlo inconsciente, dejándolo por muerto en la banqueta.</p>

<p>Este horrible ataque a sangre fría dio

requerirá un gran trabajo dental para solucionar las múltiples fracturas que
recibió en sus dientes y muelas. Quién sabe qué otras consecuencias de salud

<p>Ahora, casi 2 semanas más tarde, después de
multiples pruebas costosas, escaneos, innumerables citas y consultas con médicos
tanto a nivel local como internacional, Eduardo ha viajado a la Ciudad de

extensa cirugía de reconstrucción facial, para totalmente reconstruir las
fracturas de huesos de su cara. Después de eso, meses de recuperación.</p>
<p>Eduardo ya ha utilizado lo que tenia ahorrado

<p>Él es una persona sumamente generoso y siempre

es un abogado, así como un entrenador personal certificado, combinando dos

What's all the hullabaloo? Hi, I'm Kristen! I'm a young twenty-something residing in Rochester, NY where I work as Director of Strategic Initiatives at an awesome literary center called Writers & Books. When I'm not working, I enjoy reading, cooking, writing, and fitness. Recently, perhaps due to a quarter life crisis or a deeply buried masochism, I decided to embark on a new fitness journey - the 30 Day Bikram Yoga Challenge. What is Bikram Yoga you ask? Bikram is a very specific kind of hot yoga practiced in a room heated to 105 degrees with 40% humidity. Each 90-minute session includes a series of 26 specific postures and 2 breathing exercises, which according to Rochester's Bikram Studio's website, are ""designed for our cultural problems of stress, overeating, bad posture, and aggressive lifestyles.""So beginning Saturday, March 1st and going all the way through Sunday, March 30th, I am going to attend a Bikram class every single day. That means I will complete 45 hours, 1560 poses, and who knows how many loads of laundry in 30 days. Through literal sweat and probable tears, for better or for worse, I am going to stretch my body to it's limits and prove to myself that I can complete a yoga-thon. But I'm not only doing this for myself. In 2012, when I moved to Rochester and began working at Writers & Books, I quickly became fond and attached to one of my lovely co-workers, Sally Bittner Bonn. Over my first couple months at Writers & Books, I began to get to know Sally and later her husband, David, and her son, Oscar. The Merulla-Bonn family are three of the coolest people I know. They are poets, musicians, pirates. They are loving, warm, strong. And Oscar is by far the most erudite kindergartner I've ever met - full of curiosity, imagination, and giggles. Oscar was born with type-II Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), a genetic neuromuscular disease characterized by muscle atrophy and weakness. You can learn more about it on the Oscar-Go website or on the FSMA website. Before meeting him and his family, I had never heard of SMA. Before meeting Sally, David, and Oscar I had never heard of SMA - I want to do this challenge for them and raise awareness and money to donate to SMA research. Help me raise funds, complete this challenge, and give back to a beautiful, inspiring community. Other Ways You Can Help! Every contribution, even a dollar, helps family's like Oscars. But as a recent college grad and entry-level worker, I understand that financial donations are not always possible. Here are other ways you can help support 30 Days for SMA:Get the word out - both about this campaign and SMA! Post the link on twitter, facebook, tumblr, through email and any other social media site you frequent (the Indiegogo share tools are great for this!). And don't forget good old fashioned word of mouth! Talk it up to your family, friends, coworkers, strangers on the street! 
And finally...For those interested, I will be posting my progress throughout the challenge on this blog (I intend to do it everyday, but let's not get too ahead of ourselves, hmm?).

</p><p>Hello, my name is Blake Barnes and I am a freshman at the
University of Colorado at Colorado Springs. I came to UCCS after spending my
first eighteen years in Dallas, Texas. Ever since I can remember, I've had a
love for sports but especially one in particular, soccer. As I grew up, I
realized I had a bigger passion for soccer than any other sport. Soccer has
helped me pursue my aspiration to earn a college degree as I am on scholarship
to play at UCCS. It is one of the biggest blessings to be on a scholarship to
play the game I love. My team has been presented with the opportunity to go to
England this upcoming August as part of our preseason training to experience a
once in a lifetime trip. We will get the chance to train at three professional
youth academies, Fulham FC, Liverpool FC, and St. George’s, which is home to
the England National Team, as well as participate in three matches while we are
in England. We also get the privilege to experience the game at its highest
level and watch the Emirates Cup and the Community Shield which is a cup match
where the previous Premier League winner and the FA Cup winner go head to head as
well as tour the great city of London and some iconic stadiums like Old
Trafford, the home of Manchester United. The trip is ten days total and it
would mean the world to me to get to experience the atmosphere of a soccer
driven country. You will not only be contributing to a lifelong dream but also
will be contributing to my team and our success in next years season. The
training we will receive from the youth academies will prove crucial in our
season next year as we push for a conference title and a national title next
fall. The trip is a huge growth tool for my team as it gives us 10 more days of
training that happens to be at the highest level possible.</p>
<p>The money will be going to the trip expenses as well as airfare.
Our team decided to go through XL Tours to plan our trip. The money contributed
will be totaled up and deposited into the XL Tours account designated for
myself. Each player has their own personal account so all funds donated will be
going to me specifically and not to the team as a whole. Even if I do not reach
my goal of $1,500, the proceeds will still be deposited into my XL Tours
account. I have four separate unique perks listed below to choose from. The
first one is a special personal shout out on social networks thanking you for
the donation and that is worth $5. The next perk comes after a $25 donation and
I will send you a hand written thank you letter and deliver it to you via the
post office. At $50, the perk is a signed team poster from the 2013 season. The
poster will be signed by all the players and shipped to you for free. The best
perk out of the four is the last. The perk is a UCCS soccer shirt in your
respective size shipped to you. The shirt is valued at $30 including shipping
and with a $150 donation; you could be supporting the Mountain Lion's soccer
team from around the globe next fall on game days. In addition to the shirt, I
will be sending you a hand written letter as well as a Mountain Lion scarf so
you can support the team on those cold winter days.</p>
<p>Thank
you for taking the time out of your life to read my story. This is a remarkable
chance for myself to experience life in another country and compare soccer in
England to soccer in the United States. I am grateful to have the opportunity
at going and now I just need to raise enough money to take action. Any amount
of donation will be greatly appreciated and please share with as many people
you know to create awareness for my campaign. I understand that not all are
able to contribute but sharing via email or social media is just as important
and appreciative as a donation. The more awareness and buzz created for my
campaign the better. I am truly grateful for all contributions to my campaign
whether it be a donation or a share. Thank you again for your time and efforts
towards my trip to England.</p>
