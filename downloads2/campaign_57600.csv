<p><b>Rad. But perhaps you should first learn what lives on your skin before possibly altering the balance. Your skin is the first line of defense against potential disease-causing bacteria, and some can stem from ink or other foreign objects.  And your skin holds another universe invisible to the naked

<p><b>How does a ""Microbiome"" affect you?
</b></p>
<p>Microbes, and specifically bacteria and fungi are all around
us, but contrary to popular belief, these microbes are NOT all bad.  Microbes living with us even outnumber <a href=""http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/14/we-are-our-bacteria/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;mabReward=RI%3A9&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;region=CColumn&amp;module=Recommendation&amp;src=rechp&amp;WT.nav=RecEngine&amp;_r=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">our own cells</a>. On the contrary, most are actually beneficial,
and many species live with us, including on our skin, in diverse symbiotic microscopic
communities of bacteria called “microbiomes”. </p>
<p>Now of course, certain public locales and occupations
require extra care for removing these “germs” – such as hospital operating
rooms, hotels and restaurants etc.  We
want these public, common areas as clean as possible. </p>
<p>However, recent research indicates that people, including
parents, have become overly concerned or obsessive about maintaining a microbe
free environment. Creating a “sterile” environment is almost impossible to
achieve, and not really healthy for us, or the environment.  We endanger our children by limiting the
capacity of their immune systems to develop properly.  This is called the Hygiene hypothesis.  This also suggests that we tend to overuse all of those too convenient hand sanitizers, which could be wiping out our ""good"" microbial symbionts.</p>
<p></p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/853846/files/20140913064907-Slide1.jpg?1410616147"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p><b>So, if microbes are everywhere but mostly harmless,
shouldn’t we get to know them a little better?</b> </p>
<p>Yes, and this Skin Deep project intends to characterize your microbes for you.  But only 1-10% of bacteria can be cultured in the lab.  Identifying taxa requires advanced genomics methods.  In this regard, the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded ""Human Microbiome Project"" or
<a href=""http://www.hmpdacc.org/impacts_health/impact_health.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HMP</a>  began to
profile human symbiotic bacteria using modern molecular DNA sequencing methods. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/776202/files/20140809063339-Screen_Shot_2014-08-09_at_9.32.09_AM.png?1407591219"" src="""" style=""""/></p> <p>The HMP uses  “next generation” sequencing to read the biochemical code of DNA (sequences of A, C, G and T biochemical letters) more quickly. This has
increased dramatically in the last several years due to <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v26/n10/full/nbt1486.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">new sequencing technologies</a>.
 The Human Microbiome Project has now revealed distinct species of bacteria that live in and on various human anatomical locations, such as our intestines
(guts), mouths, uro-genital tract, and our skin.  Most are perfectly normal and are in fact beneficial . We intend to continue the characterization of <a href=""http://skinmicrobiome.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">skin microbiomes</a>. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">
</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">However, skin-associated bacteria may not be as well characterized or have acute metabolic health
effects as those in the gut. Most skin hosts a distinct community of
microbes, which varies more widely than other organs and body locales. Indeed,
the skin microbiome may represent one of the most variable human microbiomes of
the whole body, which adds to each individual’s uniqueness (For example please read articles by Costello et al (2009) and Caparaso et al (2012) plus links for more background). Naturally occurring bacteria on our skin also breakdown sweat that can cause</span><a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/15/deodorant-facts_n_4032353.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"" target=""_blank""> body odor.</a><br/></p>
<p>Skin microbiomes often differ between gender,
as females have a greater proportion of <i>Lactobacilli</i>
than males. Certain types of <i>Propionibacteria
</i>also can cause acne.</p>
<div>However, normal skin microbes such as <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i>, can also
help prevent potential pathogens from attaching to our skin, through
competition. The major skin-associated
genera are comprised of <i>Corynebacterium</i>,
<i>Staphylococcus</i>,
and <i>Streptococcus</i>.  Lots of Latin names, which we'll try to explain in plain English in your report. <br/>
</div>
</div><div><b><br/></b></div><div>
<b>Your skin, in some ways, holds your 'next of kin'...</b><br/>
</div><div>One can say these microbes make up our “long time companions” (or symbionts – see below).  However, science is still far from fully understanding their role in the health of human skin, and so a deeper survey of normal human skin microbiomes across
different global populations would help track variation over time and space. Patterns and answers to questions may possibly show up.  How does your skin community fit into the population at large?  Do you have unique taxa or differences in relative numbers compared to others?   What are the effects of lifestyle?   This is where the “Skin Deep Microbiome” project begins:<br/><p></p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>

<br/><h3>Project Goals</h3> <p>
</p>
<p><b>Goal 1 </b>-  Provide you a detailed profile (<a href=""http://www.skin-microbiome-survey1.net/example-data.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">sample data</a> shown below) of the bacteria with whom you live. This requires purchasing at least one of the Skin Deep sampling kits (I , II or III), then following the simple instructions for properly collecting skin microbiome samples, included with each chosen Skin Deep sampling kit. It's easy and harmless!  <br/></p>
<p><b>Goal 2</b> -  To obtain enough samples (~200) where trends and patterns of skin microbiomes may be discernible and validated.  The Skin Deep Microbiome project will then survey  and describe variations between skin microbiomes
across a wide range
of populations, hopefully worldwide, and throughout various time intervals. </p>
<p>With these aims in mind, <b>we are seeking as many skin samples samples as possible</b> through the distribution of any of the Skin Deep I - III kits. The larger sample sizes will help statistically validate this study, and possibly correlate any observed changes with specific environmental variables. </p>
<p>How does your personal skin microbiome stack up to others in the study? We'll let you know. For the example, we'd see if the large bacilli population detected may have any significance in the context  of corresponding environmental information provided by the donor.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/949181/files/20141021153550-Skin_Deep_sample_data1.jpg?1413930950"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p><br/></p>
<p>This is NOT a skin disease
study. Rather, we wish to better understand exactly what constitutes a
“healthy” skin microbiome.  Are there any effects of smoking, use of probiotics or location on microbiome membership?  We thus intend to perform a <b>baseline</b> survey using  “next generation” DNA sequencing technologies that we have in our lab.  This will allow us to start our assessment of
skin microbiomes among the various populations around the world. Data could then be used to address various disease or environmental issues in the future. The success of this survey depends on recruiting as many people as
possible into our study. We'd like to put your microbiome on the map!</p>
<p>Several levels of rewards (""perks"") will be given for participating, but the primary one will be the<b> sample kits (Skin Deep I - III</b>), which we will allow us to send you sampling swabs for your own skin microbiome sample.   Other unique perks such as pens, keychain lights and mouse pads will also be available with generous donations. </p>

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>
<p><b>Why do we need a Skin
Microbiome Project?</b></p>
<p>This is a citizen backed, non-profit, scientific research
study, and a way for the public to become more closely involved in cutting edge
science.  <b>For the Budget</b> - All of the proceeds raised from
this campaign will go towards research, supporting the students and scientists who run
the experiments, collect and analyze the data for this specifically designed
project, as well as consumable supplies for DNA sequencing.  For example, besides the costs of molecular supplies, a major portion of
donations will support molecular biology student training in MiSeq instrument operation and subsequent genomics and <a href=""http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1000667"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">bioinformatics analysis  </a>at Nova Southeastern University. </p>
<p>Obtaining your skin microbiome data now, while one is
healthy, can provide a baseline for future comparisons. The profile may be part of your personalized medical profile.  Understanding natural variation across space and time will be necessary to test the utility of the skin microbiome in future research.</p>
<p>Thus this project centers on how to maintain better health through informed scientific practices and more knowledge.</p>
<p>This project also intends to promote the idea of <a href=""http://iss-symbiosis.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SYMBIOSIS </a>- the living together of more than one different organism, often to the benefit of all.  Symbiotic interactions in biology are actually the norm, and not the exception in daily life.  As the world's natural habitats undergoes increasing pressure from human activities, pollution, climate change and overpopulation etc, a better understanding of ecological principles is needed more than ever, including how organisms interact and live with each other and affect their environments.</p>
<p>Data will be analyzed objectively and placed into a context
that can address specific scientific questions. 
For example, we would like to know what constitutes a “healthy” normal
microbiome in humans.  Does this differ
from one geographic locale to another?  Could one's microbiome be affected by behavior such as smoking or use of antibiotics?  Such questions could be addressed statistically if a large enough population were studied. An example of standard data output showing
quantitative, relative numbers of different bacterial groups in a skin sample are
shown <a href=""http://www.skin-microbiome-survey1.net/example-data.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, our approach is mostly from a ""comparative biology"" perspective.  Because a single data point (or statistic) may not mean much in isolation, we have kits that provide ""linked"" samples so that we can compare differences.  For example, 2 samples will allow us compare differences between two body areas (ear vs elbow skin).  Or we can profile the effects of time on a microbiome if you sent us samples separated over a period of time - e.g. temporal profile.</p>
<p>Similar microbiome projects such as the American Gut project have been successfully launched, but only our project specifically focuses on the skin. </p>
<p>We have recently added staff from the <a href=""http://www.nova.edu/healthcare/medical/dermatology.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">NSU Dermatology department</a> to our team, led by Dr. Tracy Favreau and research fellow Sergey Arutyunyan M.S.  This may allow us to apply our baseline data to studying more serious dermatological conditions in the future.</p>
<p>In the future, this study could expand to include other
anatomical locations to assess variations across a single individual.</p>

<h3>Protocol</h3>If you sign up for one of the Skin Deep I , II or III sampling kits, please carefully follow the sampling instructions which will be provided with each kit, and briefly summarized in the following video.<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FAoA4-12RHM4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DAoA4-12RHM4&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FAoA4-12RHM4%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div>.  The full detailed protocol can also be downloaded from the <a href=""http://www.skin-microbiome-survey1.net/protocol.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">protocol site</a>.</div>
<div>
<p>The sampling kits will provide donors a profile of the bacteria
with whom they live, provided they follow the detailed instructions for
properly collecting their microbiome samples, included with their starter kit. </p>
<p>      1. Samples will be requested from one or both of the
following body sites, depending on the kit you choose:  </p>
<p>            a.  Inner crease region at the<b> elbow </b>(otherwise known as
the antecubital fossa)</p>
<p>            b. 
Area behind the <b>ear</b>, at the junction of the pinna and
the post-auricular             </p>
<p>                  skin (retroauricle crease)</p>
<p>2. Isolate and deeply sequence the microbiomes from these
regions to generate a profile of the resident, natural microbial communities. </p>
<p>3.  A detailed profile
showing the types and relative proportions of bacteria on your skin generated with the universal 16S rRNA
gene will be returned to you, similar to data shown in <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nrmicro/journal/v9/n4/fig_tab/nrmicro2537_F4.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">previous microbiome studies</a> (see for example Grice
and Segre 2011 paper and other articles referenced below). </p>

4. Sampling swabs should only be used ONCE, should not be opened and kept in their sterile container until the day of the sampling.  After sampling, swabs should be mailed back to us as promptly as possible via priority or overnight express mail (which we ask as a donation as well).  If there is any delay in sending a swab after sampling, they can be kept in the freezer until mailing time. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>5. To link to any changes in each microbial community we will request you fill out an optional questionnaire, which will be available in both written and online form.  Your kit will include a unique, numerical ID code, which we will use to anonymously track your sample.  Please write this code on sample tube and the online survey as well.  The questions will focus mostly on parameters and features that may affect your skin microbiome composition. </div>

</p>
<p>The benefits from this project will greatly outweigh the risks to any participant. The physical risk of swabbing is less than shaking a friend's hand.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, before participating in the project, everyone will be asked for their informed consent, and thus to read and approve the appropriate project “<a href=""http://www.skin-microbiome-survey1.net/consent-forms.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">NSU Consent form</a>”  before participating in the study.</p>
<p>Only bacterial sequences will be analyzed; therefore, your human DNA code will not be sequenced or revealed.</p>
<p>Everyone's privacy will be protected by making all of the samples completely ANONYMOUS upon
receipt by our laboratory. Each sample will be give a unique alphanumerical code for our bookkeeping purposes, and
only this code will be available to researchers who work with your sample.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Data will be
de-identified because each sample will have a unique ID-number (for example NSU-SD14-00001)
associated with it. </p>
<p>All ID numbers
will be linked back to a spreadsheet with sample information that contains ONLY
demographic information such as sample source location, individual gender and
age, and an email address so we can send you back your results.  However no personal information will be on this sheet.
Personal demographic information will
be retained only for those who agree to be in the wider study and to link to microbiome sample results. This information will only be accessible by password. </p>
<p>We will give you the option to allow us to keep some demographic information
(your geographic locale, ethnic background, age, gender etc.) as part of the study.
However, all other personal identifying data (name, address, contact
information) linked to your code will not be stored in any database or
released on the internet in any way. This contact information will kept by the PI in a secure, locked container. </p>
All
human-subject aspects of the project have been approved by the Institutional

Rad. But perhaps you should first learn what lives on your skin before possibly altering the balance. Your skin is the first line of defense against potential disease-causing bacteria, and some can stem from ink or other foreign objects.  And your skin holds another universe invisible to the naked
eye…a microbiome, which you can help characterize via CITIZEN-FUNDED SCIENCE!






How does a ""Microbiome"" affect you?

Microbes, and specifically bacteria and fungi are all around
us, but contrary to popular belief, these microbes are NOT all bad.  Microbes living with us even outnumber our own cells. On the contrary, most are actually beneficial,
and many species live with us, including on our skin, in diverse symbiotic microscopic
communities of bacteria called “microbiomes”. 
Now of course, certain public locales and occupations
require extra care for removing these “germs” – such as hospital operating
rooms, hotels and restaurants etc.  We
want these public, common areas as clean as possible. 
However, recent research indicates that people, including
parents, have become overly concerned or obsessive about maintaining a microbe
free environment. Creating a “sterile” environment is almost impossible to
achieve, and not really healthy for us, or the environment.  We endanger our children by limiting the
capacity of their immune systems to develop properly.  This is called the Hygiene hypothesis.  This also suggests that we tend to overuse all of those too convenient hand sanitizers, which could be wiping out our ""good"" microbial symbionts.




So, if microbes are everywhere but mostly harmless,
shouldn’t we get to know them a little better? 
Yes, and this Skin Deep project intends to characterize your microbes for you.  But only 1-10% of bacteria can be cultured in the lab.  Identifying taxa requires advanced genomics methods.  In this regard, the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded ""Human Microbiome Project"" or
HMP  began to
profile human symbiotic bacteria using modern molecular DNA sequencing methods. 

 The HMP uses  “next generation” sequencing to read the biochemical code of DNA (sequences of A, C, G and T biochemical letters) more quickly. This has
increased dramatically in the last several years due to new sequencing technologies.
 The Human Microbiome Project has now revealed distinct species of bacteria that live in and on various human anatomical locations, such as our intestines
(guts), mouths, uro-genital tract, and our skin.  Most are perfectly normal and are in fact beneficial . We intend to continue the characterization of skin microbiomes. 




However, skin-associated bacteria may not be as well characterized or have acute metabolic health
effects as those in the gut. Most skin hosts a distinct community of
microbes, which varies more widely than other organs and body locales. Indeed,
the skin microbiome may represent one of the most variable human microbiomes of
the whole body, which adds to each individual’s uniqueness (For example please read articles by Costello et al (2009) and Caparaso et al (2012) plus links for more background). Naturally occurring bacteria on our skin also breakdown sweat that can cause body odor.
Skin microbiomes often differ between gender,
as females have a greater proportion of Lactobacilli
than males. Certain types of Propionibacteria
also can cause acne.
However, normal skin microbes such as Staphylococcus epidermidis, can also
help prevent potential pathogens from attaching to our skin, through
competition. The major skin-associated
genera are comprised of Corynebacterium,
Staphylococcus,
and Streptococcus.  Lots of Latin names, which we'll try to explain in plain English in your report. 


Your skin, in some ways, holds your 'next of kin'...
One can say these microbes make up our “long time companions” (or symbionts – see below).  However, science is still far from fully understanding their role in the health of human skin, and so a deeper survey of normal human skin microbiomes across
different global populations would help track variation over time and space. Patterns and answers to questions may possibly show up.  How does your skin community fit into the population at large?  Do you have unique taxa or differences in relative numbers compared to others?   What are the effects of lifestyle?   This is where the “Skin Deep Microbiome” project begins:   

Project Goals 

Goal 1 -  Provide you a detailed profile (sample data shown below) of the bacteria with whom you live. This requires purchasing at least one of the Skin Deep sampling kits (I , II or III), then following the simple instructions for properly collecting skin microbiome samples, included with each chosen Skin Deep sampling kit. It's easy and harmless!  
Goal 2 -  To obtain enough samples (~200) where trends and patterns of skin microbiomes may be discernible and validated.  The Skin Deep Microbiome project will then survey  and describe variations between skin microbiomes
across a wide range
of populations, hopefully worldwide, and throughout various time intervals. 
With these aims in mind, we are seeking as many skin samples samples as possible through the distribution of any of the Skin Deep I - III kits. The larger sample sizes will help statistically validate this study, and possibly correlate any observed changes with specific environmental variables. 
How does your personal skin microbiome stack up to others in the study? We'll let you know. For the example, we'd see if the large bacilli population detected may have any significance in the context  of corresponding environmental information provided by the donor.



This is NOT a skin disease
study. Rather, we wish to better understand exactly what constitutes a
“healthy” skin microbiome.  Are there any effects of smoking, use of probiotics or location on microbiome membership?  We thus intend to perform a baseline survey using  “next generation” DNA sequencing technologies that we have in our lab.  This will allow us to start our assessment of
skin microbiomes among the various populations around the world. Data could then be used to address various disease or environmental issues in the future. The success of this survey depends on recruiting as many people as
possible into our study. We'd like to put your microbiome on the map!
Several levels of rewards (""perks"") will be given for participating, but the primary one will be the sample kits (Skin Deep I - III), which we will allow us to send you sampling swabs for your own skin microbiome sample.   Other unique perks such as pens, keychain lights and mouse pads will also be available with generous donations. 
(Please watch the following video for further information on where your microbiome will characterized):

  The Impact

Why do we need a Skin
Microbiome Project?
This is a citizen backed, non-profit, scientific research
study, and a way for the public to become more closely involved in cutting edge
science.  For the Budget - All of the proceeds raised from
this campaign will go towards research, supporting the students and scientists who run
the experiments, collect and analyze the data for this specifically designed
project, as well as consumable supplies for DNA sequencing.  For example, besides the costs of molecular supplies, a major portion of
donations will support molecular biology student training in MiSeq instrument operation and subsequent genomics and bioinformatics analysis  at Nova Southeastern University. 
Obtaining your skin microbiome data now, while one is
healthy, can provide a baseline for future comparisons. The profile may be part of your personalized medical profile.  Understanding natural variation across space and time will be necessary to test the utility of the skin microbiome in future research.
Thus this project centers on how to maintain better health through informed scientific practices and more knowledge.
This project also intends to promote the idea of SYMBIOSIS - the living together of more than one different organism, often to the benefit of all.  Symbiotic interactions in biology are actually the norm, and not the exception in daily life.  As the world's natural habitats undergoes increasing pressure from human activities, pollution, climate change and overpopulation etc, a better understanding of ecological principles is needed more than ever, including how organisms interact and live with each other and affect their environments.
Data will be analyzed objectively and placed into a context
that can address specific scientific questions. 
For example, we would like to know what constitutes a “healthy” normal
microbiome in humans.  Does this differ
from one geographic locale to another?  Could one's microbiome be affected by behavior such as smoking or use of antibiotics?  Such questions could be addressed statistically if a large enough population were studied. An example of standard data output showing
quantitative, relative numbers of different bacterial groups in a skin sample are
shown here.
Moreover, our approach is mostly from a ""comparative biology"" perspective.  Because a single data point (or statistic) may not mean much in isolation, we have kits that provide ""linked"" samples so that we can compare differences.  For example, 2 samples will allow us compare differences between two body areas (ear vs elbow skin).  Or we can profile the effects of time on a microbiome if you sent us samples separated over a period of time - e.g. temporal profile.
Similar microbiome projects such as the American Gut project have been successfully launched, but only our project specifically focuses on the skin. 
We have recently added staff from the NSU Dermatology department to our team, led by Dr. Tracy Favreau and research fellow Sergey Arutyunyan M.S.  This may allow us to apply our baseline data to studying more serious dermatological conditions in the future.
In the future, this study could expand to include other
anatomical locations to assess variations across a single individual.
Nova Southeastern University is a private, non-profit university
(www.nova.edu). 


More details may be answered at our Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)page. 



ProtocolIf you sign up for one of the Skin Deep I , II or III sampling kits, please carefully follow the sampling instructions which will be provided with each kit, and briefly summarized in the following video..  The full detailed protocol can also be downloaded from the protocol site.

The sampling kits will provide donors a profile of the bacteria
with whom they live, provided they follow the detailed instructions for
properly collecting their microbiome samples, included with their starter kit. 
      1. Samples will be requested from one or both of the
following body sites, depending on the kit you choose:  
            a.  Inner crease region at the elbow (otherwise known as
the antecubital fossa)
            b. 
Area behind the ear, at the junction of the pinna and
the post-auricular             
                  skin (retroauricle crease)
2. Isolate and deeply sequence the microbiomes from these
regions to generate a profile of the resident, natural microbial communities. 
3.  A detailed profile
showing the types and relative proportions of bacteria on your skin generated with the universal 16S rRNA
gene will be returned to you, similar to data shown in previous microbiome studies (see for example Grice
and Segre 2011 paper and other articles referenced below). 

4. Sampling swabs should only be used ONCE, should not be opened and kept in their sterile container until the day of the sampling.  After sampling, swabs should be mailed back to us as promptly as possible via priority or overnight express mail (which we ask as a donation as well).  If there is any delay in sending a swab after sampling, they can be kept in the freezer until mailing time. 

5. To link to any changes in each microbial community we will request you fill out an optional questionnaire, which will be available in both written and online form.  Your kit will include a unique, numerical ID code, which we will use to anonymously track your sample.  Please write this code on sample tube and the online survey as well.  The questions will focus mostly on parameters and features that may affect your skin microbiome composition. 






The TeamOur molecular genetics lab has been carrying out symbiosis research for several years.  Although our focus has mostly been with non-human organisms, understanding members and the processes of symbiosis has been a primary foundation of the lab. 

The scientific environment of the NSU Oceanographic Center (NSU OC) is well suited for the proposed
research for many reasons. 

Nova Southeastern University is a not-for-profit, independent university that is classified as a research university with “high research activity” by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, and is one of only 37 universities nationwide to also be awarded Carnegie’s Community Engagement Classification. We have approximately 27,000 students, 162,000 alumni, a sprawling, 314-acre Fort Lauderdale-Davie campus and a presence throughout Florida, the U.S. and nine countries around the world. Through five decades of explosive growth, our reputation for academic excellence and innovation continues to flourish. 


The PI and associated NSUOC faculty have collaborations and ties with
many local and national scientific agencies such as the National Coral Reef
Institute, the Nature Conservancy, Florida Department of Environmental
Protection, NOAA AOML, US Food and Drug Administration, NIH National Cancer
Institute, and the US Geological Service (USGS). 
 You can meet our team on the links below, or visit our lab's homepage. 

  








Testimonies

""This project encompasses important aspects of microbiology - symbiosis and genomics. FLASM supports various areas of research in microbiology, and thus the Skin Microbiome Project fits into a specific niche that we find very interesting and vital. Their goals for supporting education are also equally important.""            - Kurt Schesser, PhD (University of Miami Miller School of Medicine) and President of FLASM.

Risks & Challenges 

The benefits from this project will greatly outweigh the risks to any participant. The physical risk of swabbing is less than shaking a friend's hand.
Nonetheless, before participating in the project, everyone will be asked for their informed consent, and thus to read and approve the appropriate project “NSU Consent form”  before participating in the study.
Only bacterial sequences will be analyzed; therefore, your human DNA code will not be sequenced or revealed.
Everyone's privacy will be protected by making all of the samples completely ANONYMOUS upon
receipt by our laboratory. Each sample will be give a unique alphanumerical code for our bookkeeping purposes, and
only this code will be available to researchers who work with your sample.


Data will be
de-identified because each sample will have a unique ID-number (for example NSU-SD14-00001)
associated with it. 
All ID numbers
will be linked back to a spreadsheet with sample information that contains ONLY
demographic information such as sample source location, individual gender and
age, and an email address so we can send you back your results.  However no personal information will be on this sheet.
Personal demographic information will
be retained only for those who agree to be in the wider study and to link to microbiome sample results. This information will only be accessible by password. 
We will give you the option to allow us to keep some demographic information
(your geographic locale, ethnic background, age, gender etc.) as part of the study.
However, all other personal identifying data (name, address, contact
information) linked to your code will not be stored in any database or
released on the internet in any way. This contact information will kept by the PI in a secure, locked container. 
All
human-subject aspects of the project have been approved by the Institutional
Review Board at the Nova Southeastern University and all animal aspects by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.   Copies of the appropriate consent forms can be viewed and will be delivered with each kit.  Please let us know if you will want minors tested.   Please check Indiegogo's refund policy but we do not guarantee any specific results - e.g. how many bacterial taxa will be identified or counted in any one person.  You can see expected results in our sample data.  After donations and samples are received, we cannot give refunds.  Other Ways You Can Help If you cannot afford a Skin Deep sampling kit at this time, its ok.  We have less costlier perks to help out the campaign, or even just a good word to your neighbor would be much appreciated.
We welcome international participants, however we request you provide an extra $12 for us to ship to your location.

We will continue to gather feedback and implement suggestions by student's and their families to help protect everyone involved as move forward.<br/>
</li>
<li>Maintaining healthy boundaries for all involved - We avoid teaching situations where we are alone with students. This is a trick of health care providers, teachers and coaches, and helps avoid communications issues that can cause a lot of damage. Currently, we request at least one parent, guardian or spouse for individual training sessions and offer small group sessions as an alternative.</li>
<li> Severe mental health issues - There will need to be an initial evaluation to ensure that GLEP participant's are suited to our services. In cases where it is not clear, we will seek a written confirmation from a medical authority.  We maintain the right to refuse students that do appear suited to experience success by our services.<br/>
</li>
<li>Reaching our target markets effectively and efficiently - We currently enjoy an excellent reputation in the community. In addition, we have at least one public school and one private facility with an interest in this launch and have allocated a significant amount of our initial fundraising for expanding our market reach. <br/>
</li>
<li>Minimizing communication issues that would damage our reputation - Due to the nature of our potential student audiences, we will need to educate and hold all GLEP personnel to a (professional &amp; personal) strict <b>Code of Conduct </b>as part of the terms of their employment. <br/>
</li>
<li>Prioritizing integrity to minimize liability - Documentation, involving other people in training sessions when necessary, education and communication, are all critical tools to minimizing liability.

Student safety - There is always a physical risk in teaching others anything physical. Medical releases and recent medical physicals are the first step, but we have found good judgement and constant communication are critical. We will continue to gather feedback and implement suggestions by student's and their families to help protect everyone involved as move forward.

Maintaining healthy boundaries for all involved - We avoid teaching situations where we are alone with students. This is a trick of health care providers, teachers and coaches, and helps avoid communications issues that can cause a lot of damage. Currently, we request at least one parent, guardian or spouse for individual training sessions and offer small group sessions as an alternative.
 Severe mental health issues - There will need to be an initial evaluation to ensure that GLEP participant's are suited to our services. In cases where it is not clear, we will seek a written confirmation from a medical authority.  We maintain the right to refuse students that do appear suited to experience success by our services.

Reaching our target markets effectively and efficiently - We currently enjoy an excellent reputation in the community. In addition, we have at least one public school and one private facility with an interest in this launch and have allocated a significant amount of our initial fundraising for expanding our market reach. 

Minimizing communication issues that would damage our reputation - Due to the nature of our potential student audiences, we will need to educate and hold all GLEP personnel to a (professional & personal) strict Code of Conduct as part of the terms of their employment. 

Prioritizing integrity to minimize liability - Documentation, involving other people in training sessions when necessary, education and communication, are all critical tools to minimizing liability. Our adherence to a strict Code of Conduct with documented processes for handling situations are a must.

<p>New parents are passionate about the safety of their new babies. They watch over them and stress when they travel with the newest and most dependent member of their family. There is no safety flotation device, or life jacket, on a plane or a boat for babies, until now.</p>
<p>The Baby Life Seat™ relieves a lot of parental worries by being the safest, best constructed and government tested and certified infant travel carrier that will float and keep a baby face up in case of an emergency over water. Locator enabling the Baby Life Seat™ is yet another stress reliever for new parents, so they will always be able to find their Baby Life Seat™.</p>
<p>The Baby Life Seat™ prototype is the first Personal Flotation Device (like a life jacket for adults), for infants. It is an automotive car seat that every parent is familiar with, but it also floats and self rights in the water. It was developed with advice and counsel from the U.S. Coast Guard and it has passed all their tests with real babies (you can see this in the YouTube video) at Underwriters Laboratories.</p>
<p>Your contributions will help complete final engineering and formal re-testing to get the Baby Life Seat™ to market around the world. Now the void in safety devices for babies will be filled when taking your baby from the car, to the airplane and on a boat. Instead of our current standard for infant safety, the new status quo expectation for our babies’ safety will be the same as for adults.</p>
<p>The Baby Life Seat™ will provide safety for babies around the world where there are no other products or competitors like it. Passenger safety is important for travel service providers, all safety focused organizations and government authorities as well as for parents and extended family. The Baby Life Seat™ brings the solution to this universal concern.</p>
<p>There are also 3 current patents with more to come that will protect the Baby Life Seat™ franchise, provide barriers to entry into the market for competitors and make certain that any other product like it meets the highest standards the Baby Life Seat™ will now set.</p>
<p>It’s interesting and important to know that laws already exist requiring personal flotation devices (PFD's) on airplanes and boats. But it isn’t the job of government to develop new technologies, but simply to enforce use of existing devices. Now the Baby Life Seat™ does exist for those transportation providers on airplanes and boats. They will have the device available for the safety of their infant passengers as well.</p>
<p>We obtained the patents, organized the business plan and laid out the rudimentary plans for building the company. I've talked to medical facility staff, government agencies, travel industry executives, life jacket manufacturers, non profit child safety focused organizations, magazine editors for boating and travel and so many more people. The consensus of the experts we’ve spoken to is that the Baby Life Seat™ is long awaited and will be embraced.</p>
<p>Please lend your support, energy and prayers to the Baby Life Seat™ campaign and make a contribution that will help us reach our goal. Share our passion, help us reach the goal of new infant safety for every baby around the world and make a change that matters.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Larry Kolthoff and on January 4th 2010 a really good friend of 10 years was diagnosed with Stage 2B Breast Cancer at Memorial Sloan- Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.  My first initial reaction was how can something like this happen to someone soo Sweet, Caring, and Loving?  I mean it really does seem as if bad things really happen to good people.  I didn't understand it and neither did she, but we agreed to fight this thing and solider on with full force and believing that God was on our Side.  Sharon has no immediate family and was living in Portland, OR alone before she came to New York City in 2009 and started work at a sales company here in Nyc.  She has been fighting this fight for over a year now and and it has had a tremendous effect on her personal and financial situation.  After starting her job and making around $35,000 starting pay, she had to quit her job because she no longer had the energy to still work and since she had only been at her job for 5 months she was ineligible for unemployment benefits.  Sharon has absolutely no health care coverage and I am helping her in any way I possible can, the cost of her treatment has been very challenging to us and we have been reaching out to anyone who would be willing to help including charitable organizations which by the grace of god have helped cover a good portion of her expenses, in August of 2010 she decided to go ahead and have the Lumpectomy done which removed half of her right breast.  Ever since she has been receiving 2 day a week cycles of chemotherapy and she is currently well into over a Hundred thousand dollars for her treatment which included Surgery, Chemo sessions and Drug medication costs which we managed to pay 80 percent of with the help of her Generous Community and Non- Profits.  We have been reaching out to anyone who is willing to help her and have been having local bake sales here in NYC to help cover her costs as well, and that's not even factoring in personal expenses bills etc, so it's pretty rough for her.  Throughout it all Sharon has been in High Spirits she can no longer enjoy certain activities she used to but her faith in God has been unshakable and we are praying every day that she will make it through.<br/></p>

There are many great causes out there, and we'd like to help as many people as we can. The best way we can do that is by doing what we do best, making natural medicines. For those underprivileged who cannot afford medical treatment, we will donate our medicines to World Health organisations, which they will then distribute to those who need them.<br/><br/>To do this we need to produce the best natural medicines available, and lots of it! We have been operating as a small boutique manufacturer for the past 3 years making herbal products in the spagyric tradition - an alchemical method of which the end result is a potent, exalted herbal medicine that stays true to the integrity of the plant.<br/><br/>Spagyrics are very different from other herbal medicines - they are the only 'complete' natural medicine as they contain all of the active elements from the plant in perfect balance and harmony, including the essential oils, tincture and mineral salts. Most other natural medicines only contain one of these elements. Because of their potent nature, Spagyrics dosages are lower than regular tinctures, extracts or dried herbs and far more effective. They do not simply mask or cover up symptoms, but instead heal from all levels of being simultaneously - body, mind and spirit.<br/><br/>We have a patent (pending) for a new extraction technique we call the vacuum circulation extraction method that allows us to optimally extract the essential oils and tincture from the herb at super low temperatures without compromising the delicate active ingredients. These components are further purified while the mineral salts are harvested and crystallised, then added back to the refined tincture and oils for further circulation and purification. The result is an exalted natural medicine, in perfect balance and harmony the way nature intended, with outstandingly high levels of purity and potency. Hence, the best natural medicine in the world!<br/><br/>Our team is made up of Phoenix Aquila, an internationally recognised alchemist &amp; teacher of alchemy, and Kylie Aquila, creative director &amp; designer. We also have in our circle of professionals, medical herbalists, classical homeopaths and Doctors. <br/><br/>We need another $100,000 funding to bridge the gap between fitting out our factory and being paid for our first large scale order. The operation will be fully self sustainable after the 3 months of production. To set up and keep it running (and us fed!) we need equipment, packaging, licenses, ongoing marketing - and some helping hands - to convert our new warehouse into a large scale laboratory.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/121591/files/20131008150004-IMG_2345-with-caption.jpg?1381269604"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

It's just as great to use after a normal shower, removing full-body odor & the need for twice-daily showers by keeping you fresher for longer.

The showers & baths we love taking daily often leads to dry skin, and the time needed to do these body-cleaning rituals becomes less & less as our schedules  get busier. We're cleaning our skins with strong soaps & scrubs  that damage our skin's protective layer by drying it out, especially when bathing twice a day or with antibacterial soaps. The germicidal foam often isn’t on the skin long enough to be effective, and ironically, that same foam ends up also killing the “good germs” that the skin needs to stay healthy.You're welcome to click the links below the “References” heading (at the bottom of the campaign page) to find out more about how bathing works & the science behind it.



This is where DryBath comes in...

The DryBath Gel cleans your body by using the skin-rubbing motion of your hands to gently remove dead skin cells, without damaging your skin's natural protective barrier
Because DryBath lowers the need for water, you can then simply use a damp cloth to wipe off any visible dirt you see, before letting the skin dry with no need for added lotion to moisturize.
The formula eliminates full-body odor while keeping your skin smelling & feeling fresh for longer. It provides a quick-fun & effective body clean, with no mess!
The truth is, besides germs on your hands, your typical urban lifestyle doesn’t cause your skin to get dirty enough to require daily soaping & scrubbing.Gently wiping your body with a damp cloth every day is all you need to clean any “dirt” (dead skin cells) on your skin, but sadly that doesn’t help much with regard to naturally removing full-body odor so that you can confidently tackle your day.
Our DryBath Gel replaces the need for water, soap, & moisturizer.  One 15ml EasySnap sachet is enough to clean 1 full avg. human body, and our active essential oils & Tawas odour-eliminator have a natural effect on the skin. 
Although DryBath doesn't provide the same immersion & hydrotherapy as bathing with water, it does a great job of cleaning the skin. The formula uses natural active ingredients to clean the skin, without wasting time, soap & water down the drain.Your pledge enables you to try our innovative DryBath Gel at (cost+shipping), and you also get one of our cool hand-made DryBather bracelets, giving you bragging rights as a #DryBather pioneer who supports water conservation.Reformulated to suit your urban #DryBathMomentsYour pledge to the NoBathing Weekend gives you an opportunity to try the latest version of the DryBath Gel. This new formula is specially made to help you during the #DryBathMoments that urban lifestyles can throw your way. 
Some of these examples might resonate with you:




Running late for work or school in the morning


Avoiding dirty shared showers or bathtubs at your flat/work/school/gym


Cleaning yourself after a run if your office has no showers


Situations with low-water availability (camping, long-distance travel, rural communities,  etc)


When bathing with water is simply inconvenient or awkward 



Feel free to tweet pictures of these & more  #DryBathMoments that DryBath helps you overcome.Sounds great? Then let’s use it to create the biggest annual water conservation campaign!Not only do our methods of cleaning our bodies waste about 40-80 litres (11-22 gallons) of water, they are also not ideal to use in situations when water & time are a limited resource. This often guilts us into feeling dirty when we can’t have a full water bathe, even though we don’t really need one. So with that in mind, we’re using the annual campaign to build a home for people to join our community of DryBathers. Your pledge will save up to 160 litres of water, and you'll have DryBath Gel for when you need to clean yourself quickly without any mess.By pledging to participate in the NoBathing Weekend, you will be part of the group that pioneers how people will clean themselves in the future.

<p>
</p>
<p>The Trager®
Approach has helped thousands of people around the world over the past 80
years, yet it is still relatively unknown.   We, the United States <i>Trager</i> Association board of
directors, and other<i> Trager</i> practitioners
all over the globe, are passionate about this work, and we would like to see it
thrive in the 21<sup>st</sup> century and beyond.<span>  </span><span>
</span></p> Our hope is for everyone to
experience something beyond relaxation, to experience peace in their bodies, and, by extension, to experience
peace in the greater world…… where many have forgotten what peace feels like.<span></span> <br/><br/><p> In order for this to happen, <i>Trager</i> needs to become a familiar
concept like Pilates, Yoga, Tai Chi, and Therapeutic Massage, and people need
to be able to easily find a practitioner.</p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<h3>WE NEED YOU!<br/>
</h3>
<br/><p> The US Trager® Association
website (<a href=""http://www.tragerus.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.tragerus.org</a>) is outdated; our ‘Find a Practitioner’ tab does not
work on mobile devices used by most people in the world today; and, the language the website is written in is no longer being supported.<span>   This means we need to have the entire website rewritten.</span></p>
<h3><span></span></h3>
<h3><span></span></h3>
<span> </span>
<p>We need to address our website issues
now so that the many people who could benefit from this work can easily find out about the <i>Trager</i> Approach, find practitioners near them, and learn about our training programs and educational materials.   Unfortunately, we do not have the extra funds to implement all the needed changes to our website at this time. 

</p>
<p></p>

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What is Trager®?</h3>
<p>  In the 20th century, Milton Trager MD, developed a unique approach to self-awareness
through movement that improved balance and mobility and reduced restricted
movement.  Dr. Trager realized that for
every holding pattern in the physical body there is a corresponding
constriction in the subconscious mind. </p>
<p>Using
gentle,
non-intrusive, natural movements, the Trager®Approach
helps bring into awareness deep-seated subconscious
mental and physical patterns of movement that may no longer be
beneficial.  These patterns can be
replaced with movements that are easier, freer, and generally
less painful, less restrictive. This leads to deep
relaxation, fosters mental clarity, and increases mobility. Dr. Trager helped post-polio patients walk
again and helped those with Parkinson’s syndrome, Multiple Sclerosis, and other
neurological problems retain or relearn functional movements that allowed them to
remain actively engaged for longer than was thought possible by the medical
establishment of the time. </p>
<p>When he
started teaching his approach to others in 1976, Dr. Trager had already been
refining and developing his work for nearly 50 years.  The <i>Trager</i>
Approach is now taught and practiced in more than thirteen (13) countries and
has helped a wide range of people:  from
autistic children to adults with chronic back pain; from people with frozen
shoulders to those with temporal mandibular joint problems (TMJ); from veterans
with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to those with depression or eating
disorders.  </p>
<p>The <i>Trager</i> Approach brings your mind and body
into better connection within the present moment through a semi-meditative
state that Dr. Trager called ‘Hook Up’.<span> 
It is a feeling state akin to what you experience when you see a
beautiful sunset or rainbow or a newborn baby. It is a feeling of being
connected to everything around you.  </span></p>
<p>In a<i> Trager</i> session you ‘catch’ this feeling
from a certified <i>Trager</i> practitioner
and you are given additional movements that you can work and play with on your
own.  The recall of the <i>Trager </i>experience, together with these
self-help movements (called Mentastics® for mental gymnastics), assist you in returning to this state of peace and freer, easier
movement.  Below are 3 videos made by various <i>Trager</i> practitioners showing different aspects of the work.  They range in length from about 3 minutes to 15 minutes.<br/></p>

The Trager®
Approach has helped thousands of people around the world over the past 80
years, yet it is still relatively unknown.   We, the United States Trager Association board of
directors, and other Trager practitioners
all over the globe, are passionate about this work, and we would like to see it
thrive in the 21st century and beyond.  
 Our hope is for everyone to
experience something beyond relaxation, to experience peace in their bodies, and, by extension, to experience
peace in the greater world…… where many have forgotten what peace feels like.  In order for this to happen, Trager needs to become a familiar
concept like Pilates, Yoga, Tai Chi, and Therapeutic Massage, and people need
to be able to easily find a practitioner.


WE NEED YOU!

 The US Trager® Association
website (www.tragerus.org) is outdated; our ‘Find a Practitioner’ tab does not
work on mobile devices used by most people in the world today; and, the language the website is written in is no longer being supported.   This means we need to have the entire website rewritten.


 
We need to address our website issues
now so that the many people who could benefit from this work can easily find out about the Trager Approach, find practitioners near them, and learn about our training programs and educational materials.   Unfortunately, we do not have the extra funds to implement all the needed changes to our website at this time. 




We are asking for $9,000 to
fully cover all costs. 


$5,000 – Website rewrite and redesign: 

 

Including compatability with mobile devices,
                       

  fixing our 'Find a Practitioner' link,
                       

  making our website more
visible for searches from people with conditions that can be helped by Trager work, and                       

  adding interactive forms for purchasing educational material. 




$1,000/year – technical support and staff training
$3,000 – for general operating expenses that will give us the reserves
needed    to be pro-active in meeting the needs of our members and the world wide community in the future. 




 Our
larger mission is to educate the public about how Trager can help all of us lead more productive, happier, and freer
lives.  So
please circulate this campaign as widely as you can.  Pass it along to people you think might
benefit from a session, or who might be interested in learning more about Trager.   Please post a link to our campaign on the social media sites you frequent and let other groups you belong to know about us as well.

Sebastian Elcano.  I'm a waiter, a music producer, and an aspiring
yogi, but first and foremost, I am a human being.  I am a human being
who seeks to realize the depths of who I am, in order to serve humanity to my absolute
FULLEST capacity during my lifetime.  
<p></p><p></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>     There
seem to be many pathways toward self-empowerment, however the path
that pulls me the strongest is that of the yogi.  As I understand it,
yoga has been practiced for thousands of years as a concrete method
to know the self in the deepest possible way.  It is for this reason
that I have decided to commit myself to a five month long, Hatha Yoga
Teacher Training Program through the Isha Foundation.  The program will take place at the Isha Headquarters, nestled at the foothills of the Velliangiri Mountains in Southern India.  These mystical mountains have been witness to countless sages, and enlightened beings throughout India's history.  <br/></p><p>     
The type of yoga I will be learning, Hatha yoga, is specifically designed to make
the human body into a stepping stone toward what lies beyond the
physical reality. I
will be practicing yoga and meditation for seven hours a day, and learning about various other aspects of yoga for 2-3 hours
a day as well.  This is a no-nonsense, fully immersive program that will whip me into the best mental/physical shape of my life, and simultaneously serve as a powerful means to know myself.  <br/></p><p><span></span>     I seek to know
myself, to embody my highest potential at all times.  I seek to know
myself, to know all of creation.  I seek to know myself, to become
the ultimate servant for the world.  However, as  passionate as I am
about this Hatha Yoga Teacher Training Program, it will not become a
reality unless I can raise sufficient funds for it.  This is why I
come to you today, humbly asking for your support in my mission to
become a fully empowered servant of the earth.   
</p>
<p>
</p><h2><b>What I Need &amp; What You Get! <br/></b></h2>
<p>     I need to raise
$10,000 to make this dream of mine turn into reality!  This is the
total cost of the program, which includes tuition, accommodations,
and food for the entire length of my stay.   I have enough saved up to
purchase my plane ticket, but I still need to cover the cost of the
program itself.  I need as much support from my human family as possible in this crucial hour of my life journey!   <br/></p><p>     Out of the gratitude I harbor for your willingness to
help this cause in whatever way you can, I have created a series of heartfelt  'perks' to offer you in exchange for your generous
contributions!!  I thought about what I could lovingly offer you with my skills and abilities, and I came up with the list of perks you see to the right of this text.  I am excited to give away my time, artistic creativity, musical ability, and love in exchange for your support!!! <br/></p>  <br/><h2>
<b>The Impact</b> <br/>
</h2>
<p>     Mother earth desperately
needs more fully empowered human beings who take responsibility for
our role as stewards of the earth.  Humanity desperately needs more
human beings who lead with LOVE in all their endeavors.  Any one of
us is capable of becoming empowered, and many of us already are, but
there must be a tremendous willingness within to make it happen.  As
far as I can tell, no other factor is more important on the journey
toward self empowerment than willingness itself.  Everything else is
secondary.  I have good news for you all.... I AM WILLING!!!!!  The most important piece
is already in place!  I have surrendered myself completely to the
cause of becoming the greatest human being I can become, in order to
serve humanity to my fullest. Yoga is the way i have chosen to accomplish this.  This is my purpose. 
This is my path.  All I need now, is YOUR SUPPORT to make this a
reality!  
</p>
<p>     All global change starts
on the individual scale.  By investing in my training as a yogi, you
are DIRECTLY investing in the future of humanity and the world.  
I humbly ask you to contribute to my campaign today, not for
me, but for the infinite love I will provide for the world,
throughout the course of my lifetime.  Thank you so much for your

Who Am I & What Is This About?     Greetings! My name is
Sebastian Elcano.  I'm a waiter, a music producer, and an aspiring
yogi, but first and foremost, I am a human being.  I am a human being
who seeks to realize the depths of who I am, in order to serve humanity to my absolute
FULLEST capacity during my lifetime.  


     There
seem to be many pathways toward self-empowerment, however the path
that pulls me the strongest is that of the yogi.  As I understand it,
yoga has been practiced for thousands of years as a concrete method
to know the self in the deepest possible way.  It is for this reason
that I have decided to commit myself to a five month long, Hatha Yoga
Teacher Training Program through the Isha Foundation.  The program will take place at the Isha Headquarters, nestled at the foothills of the Velliangiri Mountains in Southern India.  These mystical mountains have been witness to countless sages, and enlightened beings throughout India's history.       
The type of yoga I will be learning, Hatha yoga, is specifically designed to make
the human body into a stepping stone toward what lies beyond the
physical reality. I
will be practicing yoga and meditation for seven hours a day, and learning about various other aspects of yoga for 2-3 hours
a day as well.  This is a no-nonsense, fully immersive program that will whip me into the best mental/physical shape of my life, and simultaneously serve as a powerful means to know myself.       I seek to know
myself, to embody my highest potential at all times.  I seek to know
myself, to know all of creation.  I seek to know myself, to become
the ultimate servant for the world.  However, as  passionate as I am
about this Hatha Yoga Teacher Training Program, it will not become a
reality unless I can raise sufficient funds for it.  This is why I
come to you today, humbly asking for your support in my mission to
become a fully empowered servant of the earth.   


What I Need & What You Get! 
     I need to raise
$10,000 to make this dream of mine turn into reality!  This is the
total cost of the program, which includes tuition, accommodations,
and food for the entire length of my stay.   I have enough saved up to
purchase my plane ticket, but I still need to cover the cost of the
program itself.  I need as much support from my human family as possible in this crucial hour of my life journey!        Out of the gratitude I harbor for your willingness to
help this cause in whatever way you can, I have created a series of heartfelt  'perks' to offer you in exchange for your generous
contributions!!  I thought about what I could lovingly offer you with my skills and abilities, and I came up with the list of perks you see to the right of this text.  I am excited to give away my time, artistic creativity, musical ability, and love in exchange for your support!!!   
The Impact 

     Mother earth desperately
needs more fully empowered human beings who take responsibility for
our role as stewards of the earth.  Humanity desperately needs more
human beings who lead with LOVE in all their endeavors.  Any one of
us is capable of becoming empowered, and many of us already are, but
there must be a tremendous willingness within to make it happen.  As
far as I can tell, no other factor is more important on the journey
toward self empowerment than willingness itself.  Everything else is
secondary.  I have good news for you all.... I AM WILLING!!!!!  The most important piece
is already in place!  I have surrendered myself completely to the
cause of becoming the greatest human being I can become, in order to
serve humanity to my fullest. Yoga is the way i have chosen to accomplish this.  This is my purpose. 
This is my path.  All I need now, is YOUR SUPPORT to make this a
reality!  

     All global change starts
on the individual scale.  By investing in my training as a yogi, you
are DIRECTLY investing in the future of humanity and the world.  
I humbly ask you to contribute to my campaign today, not for
me, but for the infinite love I will provide for the world,
throughout the course of my lifetime.  Thank you so much for your
support!!  It quite literally means the world to me.  :)

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>With trials ranging from political rebellion and corruption, sanitary inadequacies, disease catastrophe, war, and innocent bloodshed, Africa is under some of the worst conditions in the world. In such an underdeveloped country many misfortunes are unfixable, but many are also avoidable. Although there is no amount of money great enough to rebuild Africa, if we could simply educate on things as simple as washing hands, cooking food thoroughly, and unprotected sex, many lives would be spared throughout generations. My name is Paula Tapp, and I graduated from the University of Utah this past week in Psychology.  For as long as I can remember, I have always wanted to go to Africa. Throughout the years my understanding for the sincere need for health intervention and lack of medical health care needed thereof has solidified. My passion to help and need to intervene has only deepened. I have completed my first milestone in school with a Bachelors Degree in Psychology, and will continue my education in Social Work and Public Policy to use my degree to help others internationally. I completed a local internship through the Global Health Initiative at the University of Utah this spring, and have now been given the opportunity to be their representative this summer in Ghana, Africa. I will be teaching about public health, health prevention and promotion throughout various villages in Accra, Ghana. I will also be helping throughout hospitals and villages conducting health screenings, and participating in the international medical seminar in Kumasi, Ghana. My main focus while educating throughout the villages in Africa will be about unprotected sex, sanitation, and implications of individual and collective lifestyles. I want to implement public health interventions to reduce the levels of obesity, alcoholism, and inactivity in the country. I also will present findings from last years research collected on the community about elderly health, child mortality, and the importance of prenatal vitamins in childbearing women. Another responsibility while I am there will be conducting a survey on University of Utah students about their pre and post health related to their travels in Ghana to improve any health precautions suggested by the Global Health Initiative. </p>

</div>
<div>
<p>I am seeking a donation goal of $3,000. As you can imagine, a plane ticket alone to Africa is half the program cost. With the oil outrages going on in Africa right now, plane ticket prices are among the highest my advisors have seen at the Global Health Initiative. To save as much money as possible, I booked my plane ticket early at the beginning of April for my trip beginning June 26<sup>th</sup>. My plane ticket alone was almost $2,300 dollars. This doesn’t include my program costs to live in Africa for one month with University Physician Assistants for the first 10 days, and implementing Public Health for the last 20 days. Program costs include food, shelter, bus fares, travel expenses/luggage fees, yellow fever, meningococcal, typhoid, malaria, and polio vaccinations and medications, Ghana visa application fee to stay and enter into the country, bug repellents/nets needed, and evacuation insurance required. My total cost is going to be an estimated price of $6,000. The expenses above do not mention costs to maintain bills at home while away, and not receiving income for that month. If I can reach my goal, I will be able to pay for my program and internship opportunity without loans. If our research, teachings, and health surveys are successful, I may have the opportunity to publish the findings and go to Washington D.C next spring for the Global Health Initiative. It would be great to be able to beat my goal so that I can actually receive the full $3,000 to go towards my program after website fees. This website takes a 3% of my goal if my number is reached, and 9% if it is not reached, so please any amount is greatly appreciated!</p>

<p> In Ghana, an estimated amount of 18,000 people die from AIDS per year, 350-500 million from parasites (the leading cause of death), and now non-communicable diseases including diabetes, hypertension, stroke and cancers, have slipped into the top 10 causes of morbidity and mortality in Ghana. While I am there I have specific topics that I will be assigned to educate about, and the rest of the topics I get to choose based on the need in particular areas. These statistics above are why I am choosing to focus teaching about sanitation, unprotected sex, and nutritional and lifestyle impacts on physical health.

<h3>Spinal Cord Injury and Sri Lanka</h3>
<p>Spinal cord injury has a devastating effect on a person's life and their family. </p>
<p>Sri Lanka has a population of around 20 million people. It is estimated that roughly 1,800 spinal cord injuries take place in the country annually. In 2011, it was estimated that around <a href=""http://www.asianmirror.lk/english/index.php/news/3890-six-die-a-day-with-spinal-cord-injury-in-sri-lanka"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Spinal Cord Injury"">6 people a day may die</a> from spinal cord injury without treatment. While life-expectancy for people who have suffered a spinal cord injury is around two years without rehabilitation, it is normal with rehabilitation. </p>
<p>The spinal unit based in Colombo is the only <em><strong>acute care</strong></em> rehab facility in primary trauma centre.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What do we do and where are we at?</h3>
<div>Our job is to <em><strong>provide acute care at the beginning of an injury to prevent complications of paralysis</strong></em>.</div>
<p>The 18 month old unit is run by a group of extremely passionate doctors, nurses, therapists and support staff. They do an amazing job with what little resources they have.</p>
<p>What do we mean by low resources? Until recently, the physiotherapist was managing with 2kg sandbags as weights for exercising patients. The unit had very few catheters for intermittent catheterisation available. The staff have been waiting for a pat-slide to transfer patients from bed-to-bed for more than a year.</p>
<p>These are all things we take for granted back home in places like Australia and U.S. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What else is needed?</h3>
<p>Apart from the unit itself, the organisation is currently building a half-way home to help patients transition from the unit to home and the community. This will hopefully serve as a model and provide skills for patients to survive when they return home.</p>
<p>A majority of the patients are from low income backgrounds and face enormous personal challenges due to a comparative lack of long term support. There is a needd for access to transport, long-term care or support services.</p>
<p>There is a huge focus on spinal cord research and cure at the moment which is fantastic. We desperately need a cure. At the same time, it'll be great if we can support spinal cord injury patients and units like this who need help to get by. </p>
<p>With your help, this passionate unit can start to tackle the mammoth task of implementing a great care system for spinal cord injury patients.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Spinal Injury Costs for a Patient</h3>
<p>Just to give you an idea, in the U.S, the average annual medical cost for a spinal injury patient according to the CDC is $15,000 to $30,000 per year.<span style=""font-size: 8px;""> </span>The estimated lifetime cost is $500,000 to more than $3 million depending on the severity of the injury. <sup><br/></sup></p>
<p>Granted, Sri Lanka's living costs are comparatively lower, but the average monthly household income is roughly USD$285. A lot of patients in the spinal unit come from low income backgrounds so their income can be less than a third of this figure.</p>
<p>While the country is developing quickly, spinal cord injury is not yet an area of focus so this issue as a whole as well as patients individually need a lot of help.</p>

<li>Developing pre-hospital care programs</li>
<li>Developing education and training programs for other hospitals</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to the devastating nature of the injury, patient morale can be quite low. So we hope to get some books for the patients depending on funding. The unit also requires some office consumables such as paper.</p>
<p>The unit is currently short around Rs. 3 or 4 million (roughly $25,000 - $30,000). The $5,000 goal will be a great start. Depending on how much funding we get, we can addresss each of these requirements in order of urgency and importance.</p>
<p>Spinal cord injury patients have a multitude of short and long term medical and social requirements. All this is still in its infancy so as you can imagine, this is a huge task.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact of your contribution is tremendous. For example, $2-3 is enough to buy a catheter. We hope that soon, with your help, spinal cord injury patients from this unit will be able to return home to pick up their life again to the best of their ability.</p>

<h3>Why do I care?</h3>

Thankfully, his friend Sonja Bennett reacted quickly and performed CPR on Kevin until an ambulance arrived.  After almost ten minutes of CPR and multiple rounds of elctrical shocks, the paramedics were able to get his pulse back and he was rushed to UCLA Medical Centre.  Once there, doctors put him in a coma and surgically implanted an ICD in his chest - a small device similar to a pace-maker that will detect if Kevin's heart ever stops again and correct it by delivering a jolt of electricity.</p>
<p>Kevin is now home and has made a full recovery.  He's already back at work with the consent of his doctors.  (It helps that his current workplace is the emergency department at Vancouver General Hospital!)</p>
<p>As Canadians, we would hope that travel insurance would save us in situations like this, but there can be complications to international situations and limitations to coverage.  Consequently, Kevin and his family incurred substantial out-of-pocket costs during this difficult time.</p>
<p>Ten days in an American hospital can obviously be quite expensive. We, his friends and colleagues, want to help him settle these unexpected bills, and show him we're glad he's still here.</p>
<p>Any funds that we can raise for him would have a huge impact. Not only would the contributions help with the medical costs, but they would also let him know that we all look out for one another in times of need.</p>

</div><div>
<p></p>
<p>The
stress you feel throughout the day, and in your body and life, is caused by
multiple factors. We - at the V1bes team have not settled for a measurement of
your pulse from an arm band to be your stress detector.  The
optically measured pulse is a limited stress indicator. Stress
has many causes. To understand them better, we have created a triple
bio-signal sensor - all in one ring. By measuring the electrical signals
from brainwaves, heart rate and electromagnetic field-absorption, you receive a more complete understanding of what causes your
stress. This is the foundation for knowing how to manage it. Know yourself,
revive yourself.</p>

<h2>Questions and Answers</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Q: How does it work?   </b></p>
<p>A:  V1bes detects the very subtle voltage fluctuations between the sensors skin electrode (under the ring, touching the finger) and the antenna electrode (silver tube).   The V1bes app and cloud then analyze these signal's frequencies.</p>
<p><b>Q Is it harmful?  </b></p>
<p>A:  The V1bes measurement is passive and does not induce electrical- or other impulses into the human body (as compared to bio-impedance or many optical sensors).  It uses a Zigbee radio signal as we consider it to be the least harmful available wireless protocol for the human body.</p>
<p><b>Q: Can V1bes be used on iOS and Android?</b></p>
<p>A: Yes.  We will have apps both for iPhone and Android devices.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q:  When will you deliver the sensors?</b></p>
<p>A:  From serial production and IOS we deliver during 3Q 2015. <span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> SDK sensors for Android are shipped within 2 months.  For CES 2015 clients which use Android, we also deliver withing 2 months. </span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p><b>Q:  What if you don't reach your goal?  Will you still deliver?</b></p>
<p>A:  Yes we will definitely deliver even if we don't reach the goal.   We assemble the sensors in Finland as 3D printed versions.  We are fully committed to ship because the main idea of this campaign is to get initial users and experience.   We are in it for the long run - this is only the beginning.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q: How are the ring sizes going to work?</b></p>
<p>A: Currently we use strap band which you tighten to a good fit on your finger.  The current version is not in<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">tended to be on the finger continuously.  The strap band makes it easy for several persons to use the same ring.   </span></p>
<p><b>Q: How long will battery last with a full charge?  And how do you charge it?</b></p>
<p>A: With our current prototype, depending on usage, battery can last up to 15 hours.  Charging takes about 90 minutes.   The battery can be changed.  The battery is charging from normal USB computer port or standard USB charger.</p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Q: Are you able to ship internationally?</b><br/></p>
<p>A: Yes and shipping by standard mail is included.  </p>
<p><b>Q: Does the price include VAT (Value Added Tax)</b></p>
<p>A: No, we cannot take into account regional VAT in this campaign.  There may be a VAT surcharge payable by the buyer if the local authorities so demands.</p>
<p><b>Q: Is V1bes a formal medical device?</b></p>
<p>A: No, and currently we have no plans to file for FDA or similar approvals.  </p>
<p><b>Q:  How do I wear the V1bes ring?</b></p>
<p>A:  The sensor shal be on your right hand index finger with the silver antenna pointing to the left.   </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q:  What does the Stress-Test measure?</b></p>
<p>A:  The Stress Test Meter shows all three stress tests in one meter.   First you measure your brainwaves by leaning your hand against the forehead (25 secs, test #2), then you keep the hand in the air for a 25 seconds surround test and finally you do the heart-rate stress test for 25 seconds.  Now the Stress Meter will show all these three tests in one picture.   The meter also shows your previous tests which you have done with test button 1.   This way you can see your stress levels 'before' or compare to a reference measurements of your 'normal' de-stressed self.      </p>

THE V1BES CAMPAIGN CONTINUES:  We had such a great exhibition at CES in Las Vegas that we decided to extend the campaign.  This does not change any commitments or deals done in the previous V1bes campaign.  Neither have we changed perks or terms.   This way we want to make it possible to still order V1bes over Indiegogo.  

 v1bes extended campaign


Why V1bes?




The
stress you feel throughout the day, and in your body and life, is caused by
multiple factors. We - at the V1bes team have not settled for a measurement of
your pulse from an arm band to be your stress detector.  The
optically measured pulse is a limited stress indicator. Stress
has many causes. To understand them better, we have created a triple
bio-signal sensor - all in one ring. By measuring the electrical signals
from brainwaves, heart rate and electromagnetic field-absorption, you receive a more complete understanding of what causes your
stress. This is the foundation for knowing how to manage it. Know yourself,
revive yourself.







How can I use it?  How does it help me?






V1bes STRESS METER



Know and control your stress levels.  V1bes
looks at stress both in the body and from the environment.    To detect it we look at brainwaves, heart rate and molecular stress arising in your body from surrounding electromagnetic pollution.  When having done the tests (EEG, ECG and EMF), you will can see how your stress levels change in the stress meter.   
The V1bes Stress Meter shows your latest tests and compares them with earlier tests or reference data.   Our beta-testers has for instance noticed that the stress meter is very handy when evaluating how mediation or yoga is 'working'.   Different people react differently to various practices.     Make the first test before and the second test after.     You can also make regular tests in the mornings to compare with your reference data.   There are many ways how to use the results to improve and control your stress levels.       

The written conclusions can look like this:


1) Brainwave test (EEG)


 








2) Heart Rate Test (ECG)






Your heart tells a lot about you and your stress.  By combining brainwave stress indicators and heart rate variability, we know much more.  



3) Electromagnetic Pollution Test (EMF)





The electromagnetic fields are all around you and they can cause stress.   See the very low frequency fields with V1bes.   Measure your bed or check that your baby is sleeping in a low-pollution place.    Test your car (join our car-rating project)  or see how much EMF-pollution comes from your tablet screen.   

OUR FUN-APPS

1) Biceps competition 


We love the sledgehammer 'power-man' test at the local fairs so we built one for V1bes.   It measure's the electric activity in your muscles and the competition app tells 'who  is the strongest'.



2)  'Bio-Selfie'





Your heart's electrical frequency picture is also your exclusive 'neuro-electrical fingerprint'.  That's why we make a bio-selfie from it.   The colors and forms tell about you.   The bio-selfie seems to reveal personality traits.
Have a look and compare V1bes BioSelfies at www.b1oselfie.com

3) Match:  See how your vibes change from touch







We don't know it all yet, but we know that there definitely is something in the vibes. It influence's how we feel about others.   Measure how her touch change's your vibes.   And she doesn't even have to touch.   When she stands near you, her fields will change yours.  You can see it on V1bes.INFO

What do I get when I order V1bes?

Ring sensor
Stand unit (acting as antenna and docking station)
Controller
Cables for connection and charging
One year free storage of test data in My V1bes (Google cloud)



The V1bes App



The V1bes app shows in real time the voltage fluctuations and frequency analysis  of the most important frequency ranges.  You also choose test-program and start the tests from this simple display.   The App is open source and we hope that as many as possible join us to develop more applications.


My V1bes cloud storage
When making a test, it is automatically stored in your My V1bes folder.   There you can download and look at all your previous tests.  Compare your current heart-curve with older ones.   The My V1bes cloud will also have numerous facilities for sharing, forwarding and deeper analyzing.   We are proponents of the individuals rights to her or his data.  This data is yours and you are free to do whatever you want  with it.

What have we done so far?
We started this project in 2012.   We have done hundreds of prototypes and thousands of tests.   We competed in the Nokia Sensing XCHALLENGE.  We have participated in numerous seminars and conferences.   It has been a long path and we are happy to finally be ready for crowdfunding sales.
Here are some example of our past prototypes.   These have been presented at the 2013 and 2014 Quantified Self Conferences in San Francisco and Amsterdam.  





Timeline and how we use the funds

We need your support to spread (good) V1bes globally.   Your funds will be used for final design, production setup, finalizing the Android- & iOS apps and improving the feedback features.   All of these are almost ready but we want to make them even better. 
Our timeline:



Nov 14th - Indiegogo Launch


Nov 18-19th at SLUSH in Helsinki - come and visit us


January 6-9th at CES in Las Vegas - come and visit us


March-May 2015 - V1bes delivered to partner SDK clients (handmade)


August 2015 - our deadline for final design, apps and feedback features


September-November 2015 - V1bes serial production deliveries



Technical Details
V1bes comes loaded with the latest measurement and wireless technology. Here is a short pick from the details:


One silver
     coated dry electrode touching the finger for continuous body-measurement
     and a silver tube as antenna for environment measurements and acting as touch electrode for EEG, ECG and EMG.


It is measuring 256 times per second and this data is sent by a Zigbee wireless signal to the smartphone/tablet (via the Controller) where we analyze it's very low frequencies  in the range of 0,5-128 Hz.

Questions and Answers




Q: How does it work?   
A:  V1bes detects the very subtle voltage fluctuations between the sensors skin electrode (under the ring, touching the finger) and the antenna electrode (silver tube).   The V1bes app and cloud then analyze these signal's frequencies.
Q Is it harmful?  
A:  The V1bes measurement is passive and does not induce electrical- or other impulses into the human body (as compared to bio-impedance or many optical sensors).  It uses a Zigbee radio signal as we consider it to be the least harmful available wireless protocol for the human body.
Q: Can V1bes be used on iOS and Android?
A: Yes.  We will have apps both for iPhone and Android devices.

Q:  When will you deliver the sensors?
A:  From serial production and IOS we deliver during 3Q 2015.  SDK sensors for Android are shipped within 2 months.  For CES 2015 clients which use Android, we also deliver withing 2 months. 

Q:  What if you don't reach your goal?  Will you still deliver?
A:  Yes we will definitely deliver even if we don't reach the goal.   We assemble the sensors in Finland as 3D printed versions.  We are fully committed to ship because the main idea of this campaign is to get initial users and experience.   We are in it for the long run - this is only the beginning.

Q: How are the ring sizes going to work?
A: Currently we use strap band which you tighten to a good fit on your finger.  The current version is not intended to be on the finger continuously.  The strap band makes it easy for several persons to use the same ring.   
Q: How long will battery last with a full charge?  And how do you charge it?
A: With our current prototype, depending on usage, battery can last up to 15 hours.  Charging takes about 90 minutes.   The battery can be changed.  The battery is charging from normal USB computer port or standard USB charger.
Q: Are you able to ship internationally?
A: Yes and shipping by standard mail is included.  
Q: Does the price include VAT (Value Added Tax)
A: No, we cannot take into account regional VAT in this campaign.  There may be a VAT surcharge payable by the buyer if the local authorities so demands.
Q: Is V1bes a formal medical device?
A: No, and currently we have no plans to file for FDA or similar approvals.  
Q:  How do I wear the V1bes ring?
A:  The sensor shal be on your right hand index finger with the silver antenna pointing to the left.   

Q:  What does the Stress-Test measure?
A:  The Stress Test Meter shows all three stress tests in one meter.   First you measure your brainwaves by leaning your hand against the forehead (25 secs, test #2), then you keep the hand in the air for a 25 seconds surround test and finally you do the heart-rate stress test for 25 seconds.  Now the Stress Meter will show all these three tests in one picture.   The meter also shows your previous tests which you have done with test button 1.   This way you can see your stress levels 'before' or compare to a reference measurements of your 'normal' de-stressed self.

<p></p> <p></p>
<p>Advocate Cycles is a bike company that exists solely to create innovative bicycles and deliver 100% of profits from the company back to making cycling better for everyone.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435166962/kszdnowujt2j56aysfph.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Advocate Cycles is using a new, pioneering legal approach called the Specific Benefit Corporation (SBC), a corporate form that started in Minnesota on January 2, 2015.  It is designed to help entrepreneurs start and grow social businesses and provide a guarantee to consumers that the social promise set forth is upheld.</p>
<p>Benefit corporations are like traditional for-profit corporations in most ways except that they make special commitments.  First and foremost, an SBC declares a legally binding social purpose, in addition to its general business purpose, which its directors and officers must consider when making strategic decisions for the business. As a means to be held accountable, SBCs must publicly report its progress toward the designated social purpose each year to the Minnesota Secretary of State. </p>
<p>We have elected to pledge 100% of our after-tax profits to be donated to non-profits making cycling better for all people. Because of this pledge, we have no profit motive to offer investors, so we are asking for your support to make this first-in-the-industry company a reality.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435166997/dz0rbi60oddah1fqbqvn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We believe that benefit corporations are the next big movement in business in America. With growing support needs of non-profit organizations to have positive impacts, and growing skepticism of companies posting record profits, we feel consumers will start making conscious choices to support companies that support what they love. We believe that organizations such as the International Mountain Bike Association (IMBA), People for Bikes, and Adventure Cycling Association make cycling better, so we are starting out by supporting these organizations and intend to add many others as we grow.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Our president Tim Krueger has a long history with developing compelling cycling products. A benefit corporation cannot just rest on its mission; it is still a company that must compete with the rest of their industry.  So not only are we making a great promise about what we will do with our profits, but we are making excellent, modern, competitive product with an equal or better value proposition than the competition, leading out with our Hayduke™ and Watchman™ models.</p>

<p>We have self-funded the initial production run of Hayduke™ and Watchman™ models, and they are already in production and slated to arrive in late September.  To grow Advocate Cycles beyond just a few units, we need your help to fund our marketing and dealer efforts, develop future models, and grow Advocate into a full-line bicycle brand.  </p>
<p>Our primary goal this year is to be present at Interbike, the USA's #1 bicycle industry trade show, where most American dealers go to pick up new model lines. $10,000 will get us to Interbike so we can start signing dealers.  $30,000 will get us a more professional website. $50,000 would allow us to go into our 3rd model immediately!</p>
<p>If we exceed our funding goals, we will also start to add additional non-profit organizations as beneficiaries to our efforts.  </p>
<p>Our current business plan has us posting 7-9% of revenue as profits with a 2015 calendar year revenue goal of $330,000. With your help, we can hit our funding goals, sign up dealers, and easily surpass this plan. </p>

</div></div>","Advocate Cycles
 
Advocate Cycles is a bike company that exists solely to create innovative bicycles and deliver 100% of profits from the company back to making cycling better for everyone.


Advocate Cycles is using a new, pioneering legal approach called the Specific Benefit Corporation (SBC), a corporate form that started in Minnesota on January 2, 2015.  It is designed to help entrepreneurs start and grow social businesses and provide a guarantee to consumers that the social promise set forth is upheld.
Benefit corporations are like traditional for-profit corporations in most ways except that they make special commitments.  First and foremost, an SBC declares a legally binding social purpose, in addition to its general business purpose, which its directors and officers must consider when making strategic decisions for the business. As a means to be held accountable, SBCs must publicly report its progress toward the designated social purpose each year to the Minnesota Secretary of State. 
We have elected to pledge 100% of our after-tax profits to be donated to non-profits making cycling better for all people. Because of this pledge, we have no profit motive to offer investors, so we are asking for your support to make this first-in-the-industry company a reality.


We believe that benefit corporations are the next big movement in business in America. With growing support needs of non-profit organizations to have positive impacts, and growing skepticism of companies posting record profits, we feel consumers will start making conscious choices to support companies that support what they love. We believe that organizations such as the International Mountain Bike Association (IMBA), People for Bikes, and Adventure Cycling Association make cycling better, so we are starting out by supporting these organizations and intend to add many others as we grow.


Our president Tim Krueger has a long history with developing compelling cycling products. A benefit corporation cannot just rest on its mission; it is still a company that must compete with the rest of their industry.  So not only are we making a great promise about what we will do with our profits, but we are making excellent, modern, competitive product with an equal or better value proposition than the competition, leading out with our Hayduke™ and Watchman™ models.

   What We Need Advocate Cycles will be sold through brick & mortar bicycle shops across the USA and Canada.  We also think that to be great advocates of cyclists, we also need to support the local bike shops that make for a rich cycling culture in every city.  
We have self-funded the initial production run of Hayduke™ and Watchman™ models, and they are already in production and slated to arrive in late September.  To grow Advocate Cycles beyond just a few units, we need your help to fund our marketing and dealer efforts, develop future models, and grow Advocate into a full-line bicycle brand.  
Our primary goal this year is to be present at Interbike, the USA's #1 bicycle industry trade show, where most American dealers go to pick up new model lines. $10,000 will get us to Interbike so we can start signing dealers.  $30,000 will get us a more professional website. $50,000 would allow us to go into our 3rd model immediately!
If we exceed our funding goals, we will also start to add additional non-profit organizations as beneficiaries to our efforts.  
Our current business plan has us posting 7-9% of revenue as profits with a 2015 calendar year revenue goal of $330,000. With your help, we can hit our funding goals, sign up dealers, and easily surpass this plan. 



What You Get Naturally, part of this campaign is selling our Hayduke and Watchman framesets and complete bikes. We also understand that you may have a great bike already, so there are some other great perks to supporting us.

Skincare Just Got Easier with WAY
WAY is a personal skincare companion, which collects real time data from your skin and the environment and provides practical skincare and beauty tips on your smartphone. The full solution comprises a simple, beautifully designed device and connected mobile app.




A small, beautifully designed device, WAY easily slips into your handbag and looks comfortable next to your beauty products.


#WAY Live Demo from The WAY Team
Why you need WAY?

Busy professional women and mothers lack time for themselves. Maintaining healthy, youthful skin takes time and dedication. With WAY, you can easily analyze your skin condition in just 3 seconds and receive tips about your skincare routine, that save you time and help you to look your best. 

How dose WAY work?




<Touch WAY>


WAY's built-in BIA skin sensor analyzes the moisture content & estimated oil balance of your inner skin. Using WAY you can check your skin condition on a connected device any time, anywhere.
Touch your skin with WAY at least once a day. Let WAY do the rest.


* BIA Skin Diagnosis: BIA skin sensors in the device detect the moisture content of your inner skin. This is the layer beneath the surface, which is a much more powerful indicator of the overall health of your skin than a surface reading.


By performing this deep level of diagnosis and providing tips for your skincare routine, WAY can help you better manage your daily skincare routine, and ultimately help improve the health and beauty of your skin.



<Always WAY>





WAY monitors UV and Humidity levels in the environment in real time, all the time.

- Protect your skin from harmful UV Radiation
WAY constantly tracks UV radiation levels and provides tips to help you stay safe, whether outside in the sun, or inside under UV lighting.






*Why you need UV Protection (From World Health Organization)While some UV exposure is essential for production of vitamin D, over-exposure can lead to serious long term health concerns, including skin cancer. As well as excessive exposure to UV rays from the sun, artificial lighting indoors can contribute to skin damage. 



- Protect your skin from dry conditions


Most of know that dry conditions are not good for our skin, but it's tough to qualify dryness levels and take appropriate action. WAY was designed to help you track both the moisture content of your skin and environment. By constantly monitoring conditions and providing qualified skincare tips, WAY takes the mystery out of skincare.





*Why you need to monitor dry condition Dry conditions can contribute to premature skin aging. Therefore moisturizing is a vital step in keeping your skin healthy and beautiful. However,  most of us don’t know how dry our surrounding environment is, how it affects our skin, and what we should do about it.



<Follow WAY>

WAY provides personalized beauty tips and suggestions, using data from your skin and environment. 

Data collected from your skin and surroundings is aggregated with other real-time information (such as weather reports), to send practical skincare tips to your smartphone.

Qualified technology solution
WAY has teamed up with professional Dermatologists and Korea’s leading medical university for both development and validation of our technology. With this team of industry experts we are continuing to analyse initial clinical data to continuously improve the value of our service.
Dr. Ga-na Oh is an established dermatologist and joined our team as a Co-Founder in 2014. His industry expertise has helped us refine the technology solution and provide more accurate skincare tips. 
Note: While WAY provides qualified information about your skin and delivers tips for improving your skincare routine, it is not intended to replace medical instruction from a certified dermatologist.



Why WAY is special
A number of solutions exist that monitor skin condition, but none currently offer a full range of analysis (environment and skin condition). WAY goes far beyond analysis, and provides qualified and personalized beauty tips on your connected device. 
At WAY we are proud to have built the world's first 'total IoT skincare solution' which combines data from a number of sources and automatically provides beauty tips to our customers.
WAY abstracts the need to purchase costly dermatological equipment and far excedes the service levels of other similar solutions.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Sal. Ranny, a dear friend since high school needs help right now. He is 44 years old, a husband and a father of four small children, Raphael 13 yrs old, Angelica is 10, Jerick is 6 and Jennica who just turned 4.   </p>
<p>A couple of months ago, Ranny was dignosed with esophageal cancer in its advance stage. After undergoing a couple of chemo treatments, his health turned for the worse. Not only did the tumors grow and spread, but doctors recently diagnosed him with sepsis which is presence of bacteria in his blood. This has left him a very weakened state in which he is unable to work or support his family. That is why we need your support. If you are able, we are asking for any help you can give.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We need your help to raise money for Ranny's treatment and his family's basic needs.  His supportive wife, Jenny, has been his rock through this process.  But Jenny has to work during the week, so she cannot provide Ranny with 24/7 care he needs, and they do not have the resources to pay for a nurse. The money Jenny earns isn't enough to cover all of the medical expenses, not to mention their rent, childcare, and other basic necessities.  We would love to raise enough money to cover all of these costs, as well as allow Jenny to take more time off of work when she needs to take care of Ranny.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>All the money we raise will be used to pay for Ranny's medical bills and the family's expenses.  Our goal is to raise at least $10,000 for Ranny and his family.  As Ranny battles cancer, we want monetary costs to be the last thing on his mind.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please help us spread the word about this campaign, we need all the support we can get!  Share this page with everyone you know, and 'like' our facebook page:<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/GoAlexFundraiser"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/GoRannyFundraiser</a> Thank you for your generosity!</p>

<h3>Janet Rowe was diagnosed with MS in 2005. Until 2011 her symptoms progressed slowly, however in the last year her health has taken an unfortunate turn. Her balance, coordination, mobility, fatigue, and heat intolerance are considerably worse.</h3>
<p><em><strong>On Friday June 9, 2012 a fundraiser was held by an arts collective in Toronto called Almost Not Quite, to help raise money for Janet's procedure. They were able to raise almost $1000 towards the goal!</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong> </strong></em></p>
<p>In the last four years it was discovered that many people who suffer from MS also have CCSVI, a narrowing of major veins, which affects blood flow to the brain. There is a simple, procedure to correct CCSVI, but it is not yet available in Canada. We have to pay a large sum out of pocket <span class=""il"">for</span> <span class=""il"">Janet</span> to receive this treatment. The surgery costs approximately $6500 and has pretty astounding success rates. The closest most affordable clinic is in Albany, NY and <span class=""il"">Janet</span> would be able to have the treatment as soon as July.</p>
<h3> </h3>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise approximately $5500 to be able to pay for the surgery in Albany.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are very hopeful that the CSSVI treatment will alleviate Janet's symptoms particularly as the heat of the summer inches closer. Those who suffer from MS often have a harder time in extreme weather conditions.

<p>We need to improve our practice grounds!  We just do not have enough space, and the little space we do have is unlevel, full of rocks or a basketball court.</p>
<p>Our school is located on top of a mountain and all the sports at the High School and Elementary School share this one field and a basketball court for practice.  My friends and I would love to play sports after school but there is so little space.  And, we are too far from better facilities :(. </p>
<p>Please help support this project so that after a long day of classes we too can play!</p>
<p><strong>The Community</strong></p>
<p>La Trinidad National High School is located in Lubas, La Trinidad, Benguet Philippines.  It’s a small community with about 2,000 residents.  People are mainly farmers and it’s a big struggle for them to send their kids to school.  Thus, students go to school with a very minimal allowance or worst none at all.  The community is a bit far from the main town and most people walk as means of transportation.  Children would normally do the same going to school.  The school’s budget does not provide much money to purchase sports equipment.</p>
<p>Besides financial problems for many of the students they face family issues at home that can range from parents not being home (whether working or overseas), raising younger siblings, deceased parents, drunk parents.  To go along with this many students are addicted to computer games.  They will not only cut school to play, they will lie to their parents, steal, skip meals, not sleep in order to play at the computer shops.  However, sports and in particular school sports can help steer the students in the right direction.</p>
<p>The elementary school situated directly above the high school faces many similar issues.</p>
<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>
<p>One of the major issues for the students at La Trinidad National High School (LTNHS) in Lubas La Trinidad, Benguet, Philippines is absenteeism.  From July 4, 2011 to August 12, 2011 36% of first year, 20% of second year, and 24% for third and fourth year students were absent from school.  Among the more than 400 students, 295 committed 464 absenteeism incidents.  Absenteeism is a leading cause in the schools failure rate and dropout rate.  The teachers have found that they can use sports to motivate students to come to school, since many love playing sports, therefore not only decreasing absenteeism incidents, but also, decreasing the dropout rate.</p>
<p>However, the students have trouble practicing because there is limited space at or near La Trinidad National High School.  The school is situated on the mountainside making level land space even more limited.  All the land that is currently available near the school is the elementary school’s basketball court and small field (which is not flat, covered in rocks, and is smaller than a basketball court).  Thus, when students want to practice they must either share the limited spaces or travel to better playing facilities.  Travelling not only takes time but, it costs the students money that they do not have. </p>
<p><strong>The Project</strong></p>
<p>We are trying to expand and improve the space we have for practicing/playing sports.  By improving the field as we are planning to do, it will give us significantly better and more space to play. </p>
<p>We hope that this will increase the student participation  in some of our sports and other extracurricular activities and in doing so will hopefully motivate our students to excel to greater heights inside and outside of the classroom!</p>

<p><strong><strong><strong>My name is Sara Smith and I am from Lubbock, Texas. I would like to take a minute and tell you about a friend and co-worker, Amber </strong><strong>Cooper, and her precious little boy Rayden.</strong>  </strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>8-year old Rayden was born 11 weeks premature and he suffers from severe, persistent, life-threatening asthma, which did not begin to surface until he was 6. He is unable to play sports or participate in normal outdoor activities because of his illness. This is what Rayden's mother had to say: ""He has suffered severe depression because he can't take part in what his friends are doing. When Rayden was told that he was not going to get to play sports or participate in P.E. at school with his friends, it hit him really hard. At 6 years old, Rayden was put on Lexapro, a depression medication, because he was so angry about his health. He said that he wanted to die and that he wanted to jump in the street so a truck would hit him. That broke my heart. What hurt the most is when he looked in my eyes and asked why I even had him. I have never had a more helpless feeling."" </strong></p>
<p><strong>In the last 6 months, Rayden has been hospitalized 3 times. The resources available in Lubbock are now exhausted, and his pulmonologist has decided that he needs to go to National Jewish Health in Denver, Colorado for proper treatment.</strong></p>
<p><strong>National Jewish Health is known worldwide for treatment of patients with respiratory, cardiac, immune and related disorders, and for groundbreaking medical research.

<p><strong>Rayden's family needs funds for traveling and other expenses during the 10-14 days that they will need to be in Denver. Their doctor wants them to go in March 2013, but the trip itself is dependent on the family's financial situation. That's where you come in!    </strong></p>

My last lab work just came back with some positive results and as of August 9th I will be released from HOSPICE CARE.  Unfortunatly I still do have Liver Disease and Pancreatitis.
I was Blessed to have HOSPICE helping me but now I am asking for some much needed assistance.  Since I still can't work or drive I am asking for your HELP.  Anything that you could do would be much appreciated.
Throughout this I did pick up a hobby of making jewelry out of hemp rope and beads.  I would like to offer the following as a small token of my appreciation.  For a $25 donation a hand crafted keychain.  $35 a bracelet, 50 a necklace and for 100 you would receive all 3 in matching designs.
All of your donations would go directly towards all doctor visits, medications and living expenses.  Hopefully  GOD willing one day I will be well enough to go back to work.
Even if you cannot spare anything I will gladly accept any and all prayers.
If you would like to write my e-mail is larrystrouse@yahoo.com
Thank You and God Bless

<p>SurveyHero is really for everyone.
It can help students with their projects (or with organization a party), start-upers and small / medium-sized businesses achieve their business dreams.
It's powerful enough for large companies, even for research agencies. We have
created a comic story to continue and our own superhero who will accompany you
through the entire creation of the survey. It provides interesting tips,
tricks, methodological guidance and it will certainly often make you laugh ;).
The main idea is that each of us can become real superhero in everyday life
and does not need superhuman strength or iron suit - just follow your dreams and
try to achieve your life or business goals. SurveyHero is the tool which
will definitely help you with it. So what are you waiting for? Pick your perk

<h3>How it Works</h3>
<p>Simply put, here's how Vive Tennis works:</p>
<ul>
<li>During a match, Vive stands by, waiting patiently next to the net</li>
<li>Vive uses its proprietary tracking technology to identify once a ball is no longer in play</li>
<li>Vive retrieves the ball and brings it back to you at the baseline</li>
</ul>
<p>If you urgently need Vive to stop chasing the ball, use the accompanying wristband which has an instant shut-off option (wristband included with every Vive Tennis order).</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Specs + the Tech</h3>
<p>We're using the most cutting-edge tech to create one insanely intelligent design. Here's the skinny on what we're cooking up.</p>

<p><br/>We have attended the regional tournament in Roanoke, Virginia, in which we placed 3rd and got a berth into the World Cup, resulting in a global rank of 17th. PSU Quidditch has also attended the Turtle Cup (Maryland), City of Brotherly Love Cup (Chestnut Hill College), World Cups IV and V, and its own Nittany Cup.</p>
<p>The World Cup comes with a cost though, which is where we ask your help. With contributions and donations of any size, we can ensure that the team members of PSU Quidditch will have an amazing time at the World Cup.</p>

<h3>Funding Breakdown</h3>
Being an official club sport as of last year, we do get some school funding, but it is not nearly enough to cover costs. We also try to keep dues down so that non-tournament members can have fun too. The other costs come out of pocket.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Any help is great help in decreasing the costs of airfare, hotel stay, local transportation and sports equipment. And who knows, if we raise enough, maybe we can eat more than ramen noodles for a while!</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
If you've ever been on a team or in a club, you understand our passion for our sport. You understand the drive we have for competing and proving ourselves to the other teams. And if you've ever been in college or provided for yourself, you understand the financial burden we are under. Quidditch isn't a part of everybody's budget, so every penny counts.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
Can't spare any change, don't worry! Send this along to your friends, post it to Facebook or Twitter. Anyone you know that loves Penn State (or hates our rivals), or loves Harry Potter should be more than willing to help us out.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We also sell Club Quidditch Shirts, so inquire if you are interested!</div>

<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong><span style=""font-size: medium;"">NAMO</span></strong><span style=""font-size: medium;""> stands for </span><strong><span style=""font-size: medium;"">natural motion</span></strong><span style=""font-size: medium;""> and refers to the ability of the seat to follow the rider’s natural movements.</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">The fixed position of today’s bicycle seats is enough to cause major problems for bike riders. We all <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">know what rigid seating can do to the most sensitive part of our bodies. Users of small size seats experience pain because of tissue compression </span>and chafing that occurs when user's body rubs across the surface of the seat. The compression and subsequent friction of tissues between the seat and hip bones causes discomfort. In extreme cases it can even cause severe injuries.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">On the other hand Namo Seat moves together with the rider. It works with the body and not against it. The rider does not have to overcome the resistance of the seat nor worry about <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">pain caused by it.</span> The seat moves in tandem with the rider, side to side, helping him efficiently transfer power from his legs to the pedals.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Drop down nose design and use of modern materials makes Namo Seat one of the best looking bicycle seats as well as one of the best performing. Thanks to patent pending technology the rider's movements are no longer restricted by a fixed seat. That one feature alone may re<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">sult in energy savi</span>ngs and increase in bicycling efficiency. Over time this can result in higher overall performance.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Namo Seat works with you and not against you. It supports your body without restricting it. It is the only seat that can swing with you from left to right without forcing you to bend your spine unnaturally in the process. The below pictures show the seat swinging and rotating from left to right +/-10 degrees and its effects on the spine.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong>The seat is designed to provide secure support to the rider's body even at the maximum swing of 10 deg side to side. <span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong>What's more</strong></span> the seat moves slightly up as it rotates thus making sure that the rider always maintains perfect balance regardles whether she/he is riding straight or making a turn.</strong><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><img alt=""03_effective"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/917322/pictures/original/20130708131259-03_effect_profile.png?1373314381"" src="""" style="""" title=""03_effective""/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Namo Seat is unique because as it rotates it creates a smaller “effective profile”. <strong>As it swings from side to side it changes it's top view shape which allows for more leg room.<br/></strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">A wider seat means more surface area therefore the ischial bones (the bones which make contact with the seat) can have more space for comfort. More space equals proper rest on the seat.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""outline1"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/826691/pictures/original/20130523055652-out1.jpg?1369313815"" src="""" style="""" title=""outline1""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">The below illustration shows comparison between traditional (fixed) seat and Namo Seat rotated 10 degrees to the left. It clearly shows that in spite of wider profile, effective profile of Namo Seat is narrower than that of a traditional seat! For a full range of motion it means smaller profile by as much as 16mm when compared to a comparable traditional seat.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">In short Namo Seat is both: more comfortable and sportier!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><img alt=""dim-2"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/826692/pictures/original/20130523055835-16mm.jpg?1369313917"" src="""" style="""" title=""dim-2""/></span></p>

We love the feeling of cool air rushing around us. We love the sun of open roads and the shade of woods. We love the freedom bicycles give us to go anywhere we want. It is all beautiful except for one minor thing – painful seating.
 

 


 
NAMO stands for natural motion and refers to the ability of the seat to follow the rider’s natural movements.
The fixed position of today’s bicycle seats is enough to cause major problems for bike riders. We all know what rigid seating can do to the most sensitive part of our bodies. Users of small size seats experience pain because of tissue compression and chafing that occurs when user's body rubs across the surface of the seat. The compression and subsequent friction of tissues between the seat and hip bones causes discomfort. In extreme cases it can even cause severe injuries.
On the other hand Namo Seat moves together with the rider. It works with the body and not against it. The rider does not have to overcome the resistance of the seat nor worry about pain caused by it. The seat moves in tandem with the rider, side to side, helping him efficiently transfer power from his legs to the pedals.
Drop down nose design and use of modern materials makes Namo Seat one of the best looking bicycle seats as well as one of the best performing. Thanks to patent pending technology the rider's movements are no longer restricted by a fixed seat. That one feature alone may result in energy savings and increase in bicycling efficiency. Over time this can result in higher overall performance.
 

Namo Seat works with you and not against you. It supports your body without restricting it. It is the only seat that can swing with you from left to right without forcing you to bend your spine unnaturally in the process. The below pictures show the seat swinging and rotating from left to right +/-10 degrees and its effects on the spine.

 

The seat is designed to provide secure support to the rider's body even at the maximum swing of 10 deg side to side. What's more the seat moves slightly up as it rotates thus making sure that the rider always maintains perfect balance regardles whether she/he is riding straight or making a turn.
 

Namo Seat is unique because as it rotates it creates a smaller “effective profile”. As it swings from side to side it changes it's top view shape which allows for more leg room.
A wider seat means more surface area therefore the ischial bones (the bones which make contact with the seat) can have more space for comfort. More space equals proper rest on the seat.
 

 
The below illustration shows comparison between traditional (fixed) seat and Namo Seat rotated 10 degrees to the left. It clearly shows that in spite of wider profile, effective profile of Namo Seat is narrower than that of a traditional seat! For a full range of motion it means smaller profile by as much as 16mm when compared to a comparable traditional seat.
In short Namo Seat is both: more comfortable and sportier!

 There is no other seat in the world that can do this.
 


 
Upper (swinging) part of the seat can be disconnected from the main body and replaced with different size or style of Namo Seat making it greatly customizable and adaptable to varying requirements of different riders.
 

 
 
Knowing all the advantages of Namo Seat over traditional seats, what would you choose?
 Pain or no pain?
 

The main structural element of the seat is based on a shell design which ensures a high strength to low weight ratio.
1. Stress at 2x 100kgf
 

 
1. Deflection at 2x 50kgf
 

The above examples show the shell performing under the load of up to 200kgf (441 lbf).
 

Namo Seat is designed for standard seat post mounting configuration and most common 7mm diameter rails.
Shown dimensions are in millimeters.
 


 
 


 
We have built our first rig which was used to test the functionality of the concept. We have also built our first real size Namo Seat to verify visual and other properties.
Our work, however, is not yet finished. This process is a process of continuous creation and some aspects of the design can still be changed. Via this campaign, you may provide your opinions which in turn help us improve the final design. We need to know your likes and dislikes. Your opinions may tremendously improve our understanding of how the seat should look and perform in its final form.
 
 

Our endeavor is only beginning but we have already invested significant amount of time and energy into the project. Our work turned out to be challenging and rewarding at the same time. There is still a lot we have to do to make it happen but we believe that together with your support we can do it in a timely manner.
We have tested and verified ourselves the functionality of the seat. We rode bicycles with our test rig mounted and we can unequivocally say that the seat works as predicted giving the rider freedom to move the way he/she requires to. We also understand that making a bicycle component that is so critical to the overall experience of comfort and sportiness requires complex studies and involved engagement of all available assets including significant financial resources. We can do most of the work but the financial aspect of the project needs your contribution. Therefore every bit of your support can make a difference in bringing this unique seat closer to reality. We are fully committed to this project and would love to give you a chance to enjoy natural motion bicycle riding as soon as possible.
Our goals are clear and structured. We want to finish development of the seat by fall of this year and start preparations for preproduction shortly after. We have designed all the parts and identified all materials. We are ready to start talking to potential suppliers and organize the logistics but all estimates indicate that first preproduction seat should be available early next year (circa February/March 2014) and the final production parts by mid July 2014. In the meantime we need to purchase materials and tools necessary to satisfy production requirements on a continuous basis.
This campaign is about raising funds to move an extraordinary bicycle seat we call Namo Seat (patent pending) from development phase to production.
Estimated schedule
August 2013– End of Indiegogo campaign
November 2013– End of development
March 2014 – Preproduction parts
July 2014 – Production and delivery to customers
 

We need your help to finalize our preproduction development of Namo Seat and go into mass production.
Here is how we will invest the funding we receive:
1) Preproduction Seat Development: We have started the preproduction parts development but the majority of the funding requested will be applied to complete final parts development, additional testing as well as optimizations and modifications required by production suppliers.
2) Mass Production: We need your support to secure procurement of the long lead components (tooling) and meet the minimum order quantities required.
With your support we expect to have the first Namo Seat in your hands by early July 2014.
The amount of funding we require to achieve the final milestones is $100,000. We hope you find this project exciting and will support us with this unique and valuable technology.
We are very excited about this project and hope you are too. Please share Namo Seat with your friends too!
We truly appreciate your support.
 

We at Namo Dynamics are a small but dedicated team of people who brought together a rich and versatile set of skills that allowed for the development of the first natural motion bicycle seat. The inventor behind Namo Seat is a long time design engineer whose design services span over many years and have been appreciated by numerous automotive and agricultural corporations in the USA.
Jan is known for his excellent service to John Deere, Case Corporation, Motorola Automotive, Eaton or Siemens Automotive. These are just a few large corporations to name but it was the rich experience of all these members and their high level of expertise in their respective areas of professional activities what allowed for the development of the Namo Seat.

<p align=""left""><i>""The National Carer’s Strategy highlights that carers are extremely vulnerable &amp; that there is a major lack of resources for voluntary carers in Ireland. Many carers are family or friends which have been suddenly thrown into a position of looking after someone on a full/part time basis. Often there are fears of under/over dosing &amp; the responsibility may lie with the carer if there is no paper trail of what the patient took last. If a paramedic were to turn up, for example, they may not be able to know what the patient’s medical history is or who the next of kin is. Many parents of sick children have said that this is a really frightening experience to be suddenly, not just a mum, but a carer and nurse all in one. But there are many other aspects in managing a person’s health, such as managing appointments, storing medical results &amp; ensuring others have quick &amp; easy access to your information in the case of an emergency [e.g. not password protected nor electricity reliant&gt;.</i></p>
<p align=""left""><i>We feel that the MediStori is an invaluable tool to help carers keep their loved ones medical information together in one unit &amp; to have their most accurate &amp; up to date information, easily accessed at any one time, by any of the health care providers associated with that person. It offers carers a simple yet effective solution to help manage all aspects of one’s health, which in turn can increase patient safety &amp; give the carer peace of mind. ""</i></p>

<p><b><i>Like many his age he didn't use apps or technology and so I </i></b><b><i>decided to try to create a solution to this global problem and knew it had to be something that:</i></b></p>

(Remember, Indiegogo charge us a 4% fee of the €50,000 target if we make it on time or a 9% fee if we don't.

</ul></em><p><br/></p></div>","We've been working with some of the most influential, positive, proactive groups in our country to develop the MediStori & hears what they have to say about it...
Bernard Duggan, a members of the Irish Pharmacy Union’s (IPU) Executive committee, said, ""Community Pharmacists support their patients on a daily basis in managing their complicated medication regimens. They ensure that they take their medications as prescribed and provide patients with advice and information on these medications."" 
""The MediStori is an innovative tool, which assists patients to manage their medication safely in conjunction with their Community Pharmacist.""

CEO of the Irish Patients Association, Stephen McMahon highlights that the MediStori is a patient safety initiative... [see www.medistori.com/medicalnews]

""The National Carer’s Strategy highlights that carers are extremely vulnerable & that there is a major lack of resources for voluntary carers in Ireland. Many carers are family or friends which have been suddenly thrown into a position of looking after someone on a full/part time basis. Often there are fears of under/over dosing & the responsibility may lie with the carer if there is no paper trail of what the patient took last. If a paramedic were to turn up, for example, they may not be able to know what the patient’s medical history is or who the next of kin is. Many parents of sick children have said that this is a really frightening experience to be suddenly, not just a mum, but a carer and nurse all in one. But there are many other aspects in managing a person’s health, such as managing appointments, storing medical results & ensuring others have quick & easy access to your information in the case of an emergency [e.g. not password protected nor electricity reliant>.
We feel that the MediStori is an invaluable tool to help carers keep their loved ones medical information together in one unit & to have their most accurate & up to date information, easily accessed at any one time, by any of the health care providers associated with that person. It offers carers a simple yet effective solution to help manage all aspects of one’s health, which in turn can increase patient safety & give the carer peace of mind. ""



Hi there, I’m Olive. And this is my MediStori...

I am a mum to 3 beautiful girls whom each have had complex, chronic illnesses.  From heart surgeries, mixed connective tissue disorders, autoimmune disease & a current process of trying to diagnose rare tumours, our little family know first-hand the stresses that come from managing medications, trying to get diagnosed & juggling appointments, along with everyday life! 

But even with all this going on, including my young husband having a TIA (stroke) it was actually when my dad came out of hospital after a 9 week stay in hospital on a whopping 22 medications that I knew I wasn’t the only one struggling with all of these issues!
Like many his age he didn't use apps or technology and so I decided to try to create a solution to this global problem and knew it had to be something that:
1) needed to be easy to use 
2) could store all correspondence from all health practitioners 
3) could keep an entire families history in one unit & 
4) that it could help record both past medical history & all the on-going stuff too. 
And so, the MediStori was born. 

Used together or separately, the MediStori& Memos aim to reduce the many stresses, risks & responsibilities that come with managing an illness, therefore allowing you or your loved one to just focus on getting better. They also provide the critical link between your various health care providers & allow you to have the most up to date information to hand in the case of an emergency.

The ongoing management
diaries are key to managing daily life. The
Medicine Memo is so easy to use - simply write your medications on the left
hand side, log the time on the right...at the end of the week, turn over the log
time section and your med stay in place, so no need to re-write over & over
again!
Other Memos range from food,
pain, mood and even new baby diaries and follow the same format as the
Medicine Memos. I have also been working with associations & charities
to bring out a very specific range of Memos for particular diseases i.e.
diabetes, asthma, arthritis & so on!



The MediStori Movement!
 
The MediStori Movement – Take Control of You & Your Families Health Records!
From the first day I ever had the idea of the MediStori, I always believed that it could potentially play a huge role in helping patients, carers & parents alike create positive, long-lasting change in our health system as we know it. Just by simply taking a little bit of control over our own health & learning how to communicate more efficiently with our caregivers, we can all reach the same outcome together- to simply get better...quicker! So, please get behind, not just the MediStori, but what I feel it can achieve - a positive, proactive change in our health systems across the world as we know it now, led by us; the patients, the carers & the parents.
So, please get behind, not just the MediStori, but what I feel it can achieve - a positive, proactive change in our health systems across the world as we know it now, led by us; the patients, the carers & the parents.
So I ask you, What’s Your MediStori?


   But why do we need your help?What We Need, What You Get (And How By Helping US, You Can Help Others!)




It was apparent from day one that many people (especially of my dad's age) didn't go online & if they did, were way too wary to share their credit card details to shop online. So how would they learn about or even buy the MediStori? 
I knew I would have to make it accessible to as many people as possible...and as simply as possible. And what better place to this than our local, helpful pharmacy! The only problem is, it costs me more to do it this way but I truly want everyone that NEEDS it to be able to have ACCESS to it.
We Believe for this to Work We Need It To Be Integrated On a National Level 
& 
So We Need Your Help To Do This!

So, I'm here because simply put…WE need funds to get going properly! 





We thought long & hard about how we would raise funds & we thought that crowd-funding while raising money for charity would be the best way to go! So now, not only will all monies raised help get the MediStori off the ground 10% of that will directly HELP THOSE WHO REALLY NEED IT :)
We have had to use many charities over the years for supports & services & so we carefully picked local & national charities that we will be donating to. These charities will split the monies raised equally between themselves at the end of the crowd funding. We will start with one charity initially and then unlock new charities as the campaign grows. It doesn’t matter what time the charity starts in at in the campaign, they will still be able to split the full amount equally at the end. (Remember, Indiegogo charge us a 4% fee of the €50,000 target if we make it on time or a 9% fee if we don't. So the push is on to not only hit target – but to double it or better…therefore we will have more to give the charities!) 
Our National Charity is - Heart Children Ireland!


 

This is because every one of us in our little family have a little something going on with our hearts! My hubby & eldest daughter, Micaela both have the same hole in their hearts (my hubby only finding this out after he had a stroke!), I have a thing called Bradycardia & am on longterm steroids for same, my 10 year old daughter Nicole has Arrhythmias& my youngest daughter Mackensie had major heart surgery at 5 weeks old for three holes in her heart. Thankfully we're all doing good right now, but I have to say the support I received from Margaret Rogers and the Heart Children Ireland team was just beyond amazing. I did a massive coffee morning many years ago for this charity because these guys need such a serious amount of funds to be raised for what they do every day. 
WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE DO……
“Heart Children Ireland is a support group for parents and families of children with a Congenital Heart Disorder.  CHD is the most common of all birth defects affecting one in every one hundred children born at present.

We need funds for marketing, PR, stock, staff & administration to name but a few. I would also love to create employment in Ireland& so am looking to hire an e-commerce marketing assistant also. (Also, I run all aspects of my business on my own and would love to have a team member to work with - I have been so lucky to have great supports from family, friends and mentors )We need to raise €50,000 realistically to do this right and to be able to get it to as many pharmacies as possible.

Speaking About Proactive Change with An Taoiseach...
I have already received fantastic support from Enterprise Ireland (receiving €15,000 in funds to start up) and this has all been put into the research and development of the MediStori. I have worked with many, many focus groups including parents, carers & pharmacists plus have completed surveys to get as much feedback as possible. I don't believe in ""negative feedback""...I have always turned it into ""research & development"" and listened to the needs of the patients, carers & parents.



So, I'm sure you're asking what do you get for investing in the MediStori Movement?Well as you can see from the start we have a range of perks from €5 right up to the €5,000 mark & for every single amount, 10% of it goes directly to the charities we have chosen!

The Center also treated 132 children with sickle cell disease, and many others with chronic or life-threatening blood disorders.  These conditions change a child’s life in many ways. Some spend weeks or even months in the hospital. They undergo treatments that cause fatigue, nausea, and hair loss. They take medications with severe side effects, and endure various surgical procedures. They experience hardships that force them and their families to redefine what it means to be a kid.</p><p>That’s why Phoenix Children's Hospital sends more than 120 patients to camp each year – free of charge.

At camp, children are divided into cabins by age and gender, with each cabin supervised by at least two volunteer counselors. Nurses and doctors serve as staff members each year to ensure that camp activities are performed safely and that the campers’ medical needs are met. </p><p>A typical day for campers begins with breakfast followed by morning activities, which can include everything from swimming, rock climbing and fishing to arts and crafts and camp sing-alongs. Every evening, camp features a different teambuilding activity, like silly Olympics or a dance. Campers are even given a chance to “get back” at their doctors by challenging them to silly string and food fights. For campers ages 16-18, Camp Rainbow also has a Counselor in Training (CIT) program. Through this program, CITs learn valuable leadership and organization skills.

The Center also treated 132 children with sickle cell disease, and many others with chronic or life-threatening blood disorders.  These conditions change a child’s life in many ways. Some spend weeks or even months in the hospital. They undergo treatments that cause fatigue, nausea, and hair loss. They take medications with severe side effects, and endure various surgical procedures. They experience hardships that force them and their families to redefine what it means to be a kid.That’s why Phoenix Children's Hospital sends more than 120 patients to camp each year – free of charge. At Camp Rainbow in the Arizona high country our patients develop lifelong friendships, escape the everyday struggles of cancer treatment, and have the experience of a lifetime.You can make this dream come true for a camper by sponsoring a patient. A Wild AdventureCamp Rainbow is a week-long, summer camp held exclusively for children who have, or have had, cancer or a chronic blood disorder. Every year, Camp Rainbow welcomes over 120 children ages 7-18 to the Camp Friendly Pines in Prescott, Arizona. At camp, children are divided into cabins by age and gender, with each cabin supervised by at least two volunteer counselors. Nurses and doctors serve as staff members each year to ensure that camp activities are performed safely and that the campers’ medical needs are met. A typical day for campers begins with breakfast followed by morning activities, which can include everything from swimming, rock climbing and fishing to arts and crafts and camp sing-alongs. Every evening, camp features a different teambuilding activity, like silly Olympics or a dance. Campers are even given a chance to “get back” at their doctors by challenging them to silly string and food fights. For campers ages 16-18, Camp Rainbow also has a Counselor in Training (CIT) program. Through this program, CITs learn valuable leadership and organization skills. Many go on to become Camp Rainbow staff members, which allows adult survivors the chance to stay engaged with the camp and offer support and hope to children and teens who are fighting the same battle they once did.Camp Rainbow is staffed 24/7 by physicians, nurse practitioners and registered nurses. With one full time Camp Rainbow director, the remaining staff members are all volunteers. Camp Rainbow is accredited by the American Camp Association (ACA), which upholds the highest standards for organized camping.Help Us Send More Happy Campers!At age 6, Owen (below) was diagnosed with bone cancer when a solid tumor was found in his left femur. Along with chemotherapy, Owen eventually had his entire femur, knee and part of his tibia replaced with metal and plastic implants. Help send a child just like Owen to Camp Rainbow this year.

The Australian Dropbears will be competing at the highest level of quidditch competition in the world. Twenty five countries from across the globe will compete for national pride, more than the previous two international tournaments combined, in what is sure to be a thrilling and intense competition.</p><br/><p><b>What is quidditch?</b></p><p>Quidditch is a mixed-gender full-contact sport with a unique mix of elements from rugby, dodgeball, and tag. For more information about the rules of Quidditch visit the <a href=""http://www.quidditch.org.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Quidditch Australia website</a>.</p><br/><p><b>Who are the Dropbears?</b></p><p>Twenty one Australian quidditch players have been selected from the best and brightest to represent down under and chase down that elusive gold. They are an elite squad of athletes from Victoria, New South Wales, The Australian Capital Territory and Western Australia lead by a fearsome captain/coach duo. Nine of the twenty one players are returning for another turn and seeking to better their silver medals from last time, and all are out for blood.</p><br/><p><b>Why are we crowd funding and where is the money going?</b></p><p>As a developing sport, Quidditch doesn't have the backing and professional support of most other sporting leagues, consequently, travel to events such as these comes entirely out of the pockets of the players.

</div></div>","What is the Quidditch World Cup?The 2016 Quidditch World Cup is where the best quidditch players from around the world will go head to head for ultimate glory, which will take place on the 23rd and 24th of July in Frankfurt, Germany. The Australian Dropbears will be competing at the highest level of quidditch competition in the world. Twenty five countries from across the globe will compete for national pride, more than the previous two international tournaments combined, in what is sure to be a thrilling and intense competition.What is quidditch?Quidditch is a mixed-gender full-contact sport with a unique mix of elements from rugby, dodgeball, and tag. For more information about the rules of Quidditch visit the Quidditch Australia website.Who are the Dropbears?Twenty one Australian quidditch players have been selected from the best and brightest to represent down under and chase down that elusive gold. They are an elite squad of athletes from Victoria, New South Wales, The Australian Capital Territory and Western Australia lead by a fearsome captain/coach duo. Nine of the twenty one players are returning for another turn and seeking to better their silver medals from last time, and all are out for blood.Why are we crowd funding and where is the money going?As a developing sport, Quidditch doesn't have the backing and professional support of most other sporting leagues, consequently, travel to events such as these comes entirely out of the pockets of the players. As an isolated country, travel overseas is often very expensive for Australians, and the cost per person is going to exceed $3,000. One of the key principles of Quidditch is inclusion and we want to ensure all the players who want to go can attend without significant financial detriment. Every cent raised will go towards subsiding player travel, so any amount will help reduce costs and is therefore greatly appreciated.

<p>I am asking for your support on behalf of Tyler Schroeder.</p>
<p>An adventurous life decision brought Tyler to South Korea to teach English. After living there for almost two years, he has acquired a celebrity status in his hometown of Yeosu. His imposing frame and blonde hair have always elicited attention, but at 6’2 this former champion football player is a stark contrast to the petite Korean population.</p>
<p>Tyler has always supported his community, whether it is his hometown of Tipton Iowa, Arizona State University or Iona College. He is intelligent, kind, and caring.</p>
<p>Tyler has been embraced by his new and old communities of Tipton, Iowa, Arizona State and Iona College. He is kind, strong, capable, stable, adventurous, athletic, brave, reliable, clever, sensible and incredibly cool. He understands the comedic nuance from Seinfeld and can answer any Jeopardy question thrown his way. He is a loyal friend and a team player.</p>
<p>Chronic back pain brought Tyler to a hospital in Seoul and two weeks ago he was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer called Primitve Neuroectodermal (PNET).</p>
<p>The pain originally accredited to a slipped disc, was a malignant tumor at the C1 and C2 vertebrae. Immediate surgery was necessary to relieve the pain and Tyler’s Parents, Jody and Rusty, immediately flew from Iowa to Seoul.</p>
<p>The Korean health care system is substantially different than what we are used to in the United States. Jody and Rusty arrived at the hospital and were astonished to see men and women milling about everywhere in their hospital attire. Although the Wooridul Spine Hospital is world renown, the main lobby was strangely reminiscent of a crowded bus station.</p>
<p>Tyler received different room rate options at the hospital: the more roommates the cheaper the room. Keeping in line with his usual character, he chose the $10 dollar a day room so he could be with six other patients. This would allow him to stay immersed in Korean culture while making new friends. Luckily one roommate was an English speaking Korean high school teacher and they quickly came to the Shroeder’s aid. The “no frills plan” ended up being the perfect choice!</p>
<p>After undergoing a grueling 11 hour surgery doctors were able to remove 80% of the tumor without risking nerve damage that would impact his mobility. Tyler recovered speedily in the ICU with Jody and Rusty by his side and waited for the results of the pathology report.</p>
<p>Before the report came back, Tyler underwent a second surgery to release the buildup of fluid collecting at the base of his neck. Since then Tyler has been relieved of his headaches and is now able to sit up for longer periods of time and even remove his neck brace for short periods.</p>
<p>The pathology report confirmed that the tumor was malignant and that Tyler has an extremely rare form of cancer. The doctors in Seoul recommended that Tyler return to the United States to continue treatment. We are currently still searching for the best option to transport him home. Upon returning to the US Tyler will be admitted to Mayo Clinic in Minnesota for treatment. This world renowned Medical Centre makes miracles on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Tyler has a grueling path ahead of him, but with the support of family and friends we can help him beat this disease, and help to ease the increasing pressures on his family.

<p>My name is Sarah and I am a senior nursing student at a
diploma school in Roxborough, Pennsylvania. Nursing is my passion and serving
others has made a significant impact on me. I have experienced many obstacles
throughout my journey to become a nurse and I am so proud to be arriving at the
moment where I will be able to say I have accomplished my dream. However, I
have another dream. A few days ago I was accepted to be a part of a volunteer
medical team that will be traveling to Cambodia in September 2014. When I found
out, I nearly cried. </p>
<p>I need your help! The trip will cost approximately $5,500.
The expenses will include substandard accommodations for the volunteers as well
as medical equipment and resources that will help fund our ability to provide
the most beneficial medical services to the people of the community. </p>
<p>The organization through which I am going on this trip is International
Medical Relief.  This is a well-established
non-profit organization that provides care to underserved communities in all
different areas of the world. </p>
<p>Please refer to the website for more information <a href=""http://www.internationalmedicalrelief.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.internationalmedicalrelief.org/</a>.
</p>
<p>This trip is very important for many people. We live in a
country where medical care is at its most advanced. We are so fortunate to be
able to receive this type of care and that our struggle is only monetary.
Please donate to this trip, so that we can take our knowledge, experience, and
compassion to provide these services to others who may not otherwise have the
opportunity! </p>
<p>Think about yourself, your families, your friends, your
loved ones… What would you do if you knew that just a couple of dollars could
help bring medical care? It is your generous donation that will make a “world”
of difference. </p>
<p>In the event that you are unable to contribute financially,
please contribute to this cause by keeping the trip and the volunteers in your
prayers. Please also help to spread the word about our cause for others who may
be interested in donating by using the Indiegogo “share” tools!! </p>

Please refer to the website for more information http://www.internationalmedicalrelief.org/.

This trip is very important for many people. We live in a
country where medical care is at its most advanced. We are so fortunate to be
able to receive this type of care and that our struggle is only monetary.
Please donate to this trip, so that we can take our knowledge, experience, and
compassion to provide these services to others who may not otherwise have the
opportunity! 
Think about yourself, your families, your friends, your
loved ones… What would you do if you knew that just a couple of dollars could
help bring medical care? It is your generous donation that will make a “world”
of difference. 
In the event that you are unable to contribute financially,
please contribute to this cause by keeping the trip and the volunteers in your
prayers. Please also help to spread the word about our cause for others who may
be interested in donating by using the Indiegogo “share” tools!!

That's it in the overlay image above. That was only half the story. FilterWatch tells you WHEN it is time to change your home air filters based on low air flow (dirty filters). Now we want to change your filter for you.</p>
<p>Better yet, let your power company change your filter for you AND pay for the hardware. All you do is collect the benefits of cleaner air to breathe and lower energy bills!</p> </div> <div> <h3>What's The Story</h3> <p>During the development of FilterWatch, we approached many service providers with the idea of them giving FilterWatch to their customers at NO COST.</p>
<p>It seems counter to their business since they want to sell electricity but they offer rebates for all kinds of energy saving appliances and light bulbs.</p>
<p>Without going into a big story, it's all about meeting peak demand. It costs a lot of money in infrastructure to move electricity around based on demands in one area versus another. Energy efficiency helps keep infrastructure costs down.</p>
<p>Before service providers offer rebates on a product, they want some guarantee that the product will reduce the demand. A product being part of the Energy Star program provides some of those guarantees. There is no Energy Star category for thermostats, automatic blinds, smart monitors so it is up to the product manufacturer to convince the service providers that their product will save energy.</p>
<p>That was the brick wall that we ran into in one of our marketing plans but we know it's possible to get service providers on board. You just have to give them a little control.</p>
<p>The power companies would want to be able to cycle in new filters when the electricity grid demand is approaching critical levels. Even changing a filter that is 10% clogged will make a difference if you change enough of them.</p>
<p>Check out how this works with one energy service provider and the Nest Thermostat Controller...<a href=""https://nest.com/energy-partners/reliant/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HERE</a>. If the user signs up to allow the service provider to change the temperature of their home by a maximum of 3 degrees, they will give you a NEST for FREE. A $250 deal!</p>

<h3><b>The Smart Air Filter Changer</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>So what would make our automatic filter changer smart?  FilterWatch of course.  </p>
<p>There are a whole lot of patents regarding automatic filter changers and they all have one thing in common, They change the filter based on TIME. Ours would change the filter base on reduction of air flow (how dirty it is). That's where our air flow monitor (FilterWatch) comes in.</p>
<p>Filterwatch provides the 'Smarts' and the connectivity to the Internet. It knows (learns) when the HVAC unit is running, how quickly it gets clogged, when to alarm (and when not to), and it has many other features.</p>
<p>Here is a list of specs we are considering for the filter changing unit , please feel free to comment.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Powered from a rechargeable battery (charged when there is air flow) allows for easy installation.</li>
<li>A minimum of 6 changes on a 30 inch filter.</li>
<li>Dual roller cartridges - full roll and take-up roller with pre-attached filter material.</li>
<li>Retrofit installation for existing homes</li>
<li>unload/load button to roll up last filter and tension first filter</li>
<li>Wireless communication to FilterWatch</li>

<b><h3>What Will The Funds Be Used For?</h3></b>While Mike and I do our own electronics and firmware, we don't have a lick of mechanical drawing ability between us. We do our research, we document the 'must haves' and the 'would like to haves', we make pencil drawings and we take pictures of similar ideas, then we give all that to a mechanical engineer.  Funds would be used in the following order:</div>
<div><ul>
<li>Mechanical Design</li>
<li>First Machined Prototype</li>
<li>Mock up electronics</li>
</ul></div>
<div><b><h3>What Do You Get For Supporting Us?</h3></b></div>
<p>Sure, it would be nice to raise enough funds to take our idea all the way to hardware and delivery to customers. But who are we kidding, that would require 10's of thousands of dollars. Just getting the filter manufacturers to support rolled filter material that meets our specification will  be a journey in itself. <br/></p>
<p>While supporting us won't get you a filter changer, we still have something very cool to offer and you. FilterWatch. It's an extremely smart air flow monitor that looks at the reduction in air flow to decide when it is time to change your filter.. </p>
<p>Heck, if you are a golfer, fly model air planes, or just like to know the wind speed, it doubles as an anemometer up to about 20mph.</p>

Smarika's mother, lives near
Muktinath, a village nearly 4000 m altitude, within the Himalayas. Smarika was
raise up in one special center to succeed on the studies, it is where I came to
know her. Now she wrote me, after almost two years, asking me desperately for
help. To send her mother to a hospital and cover the cost of an operation is a
sum of money that she cannot cover. But together we can save the life of
this woman. Here you have the first letter I received from Kathmandu. I want to thank you for
your humble cooperation. € 2000 could save the life of a Nepali woman, and for

""Hello Adriana

Perdoname porque estoy escribiendo en ingles ....vale.
Que te piensas que alguien quiere cosa grande pero no es posible. 

When I joined Vistare Foundation, I had decided that I will change my life. I left my sick father, my mother and brother all in their situation so that I can lift my life and fulfill my dream.


So many things happened in my life. I never took it complication as Carlos Uncle is always there behind me. Because of him, I could do my father's operation. Nevertheless, he did everything from his side.I am about to finish my bachelor... He wants me to complete masters. I told him that I wanted to go abroad for my studies.... fight for scholarship...... Time has put me other situation, this time my mother is really sick. She need to  operate as she has heart disease. Father is jobless now... I am knocking to each door wherever possible finding job for him.I am sharing with you... don't take it other way. Because sharing with other is good way of getting rid of pain.... rightWhat do you think I should do?

What We Need 


To Take Out Full Page AD on NY Times to
denounce this legislation because we believe Premier Pauline Marois policies  could be described as xenophobic and racist, and everyone has the right to be respected for
their beliefs, and if this bill is passed we're calling a cultural & economic boycott
of Quebec, because this Law is wrong, illegal and a disgrace to humankind. and no one want's to  be in a place where someone feels that their values can only flourish if those
of their neighbors are suppressed.




The Impact


With your help, and only with
your help, we can say to Quebec “back off”.  The idea of banning someone from being in a
position of authority, like a teacher or a doctor, because they wear a kippah
or a turban, is unconscionable.

Conclusion
Pastor Martin Niemöller’s famous poem about the rise of the Nazis illustrates when a government attacks the rights of minorities and the majority is silent

 
“First they came for the communists, and I did not speak out—
because I was not a communist;
Then they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—
because I was not a socialist;
Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—
because I was not a trade unionist;
Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—
because I was not a Jew;
Then they came for me—
and there was no one left to speak out for me.”

<p><i>We want to talk to you about g</i><i style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">oing to the bathroom. </i></p>
<p>To quote a famous children’s book, “Everybody poops!”- But sometimes we have to hold it because our only options are pretty gross. </p>
<p>We’ve created <i>the Dungaroo</i> to make your portable toilet experience enjoyable, and to ultimately help bring toilet options to the <b>2.5 billion </b>people around the world who lack access to adequate sanitation. The Dungaroo is a waterless, odorless toilet made of mostly plastic materials that uses specially lined bags to treat and store the waste.</p>
<p><b><i>Mission</i></b></p>
<p>Our mission is to offer environmentally-friendly, hygienic sanitation solutions that are odorless, waterless, and economical. We’re working to provide a healthful, clean, and enjoyable bathroom experience.</p>
<p>Call us idealists, but we want our customers to love going to the bathroom! </p>
<p>While people in the United States have been stuck with sub-par portable toilets, the developing world lacks even that. Along with clearing the air in domestic bathrooms, we’ll also provide our users with clear consciences as we work to ensure that hygienic sanitation is available worldwide. </p>
<p><b><i>How We Got started</i></b></p>
<p>I (Liz Morris) am the founder and CEO of Sanitation Creations.  Four years ago, I was starting grad school at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.  I wanted to attend a one-year masters program in a big city with no required research.  Somehow I ended up in a two-year masters program in a college town with required research.  I was a bit of an oddball in the Environmental Sciences and Engineering department because my background is in Packaging Science and their research specialties are water and air. Luckily, my advisor was just transferring from the World Health Organization's Water and Sanitation Sector.  In our first conversation, he asked how I felt about packaging poop for my research.  I knew I had found the perfect project!  </p>

We want to talk to you about going to the bathroom. 
To quote a famous children’s book, “Everybody poops!”- But sometimes we have to hold it because our only options are pretty gross. 
We’ve created the Dungaroo to make your portable toilet experience enjoyable, and to ultimately help bring toilet options to the 2.5 billion people around the world who lack access to adequate sanitation. The Dungaroo is a waterless, odorless toilet made of mostly plastic materials that uses specially lined bags to treat and store the waste.
Mission
Our mission is to offer environmentally-friendly, hygienic sanitation solutions that are odorless, waterless, and economical. We’re working to provide a healthful, clean, and enjoyable bathroom experience.
Call us idealists, but we want our customers to love going to the bathroom! 
While people in the United States have been stuck with sub-par portable toilets, the developing world lacks even that. Along with clearing the air in domestic bathrooms, we’ll also provide our users with clear consciences as we work to ensure that hygienic sanitation is available worldwide. 
How We Got started
I (Liz Morris) am the founder and CEO of Sanitation Creations.  Four years ago, I was starting grad school at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.  I wanted to attend a one-year masters program in a big city with no required research.  Somehow I ended up in a two-year masters program in a college town with required research.  I was a bit of an oddball in the Environmental Sciences and Engineering department because my background is in Packaging Science and their research specialties are water and air. Luckily, my advisor was just transferring from the World Health Organization's Water and Sanitation Sector.  In our first conversation, he asked how I felt about packaging poop for my research.  I knew I had found the perfect project!

<p>Hello! Speaking on behalf of participants of the BAM (Becoming A Man) Sports Program, we would like to introduce ourselves. We are Malik, Dontonio, Demarcus, and Marcus and we are all sophomore students at William R. Harper High School, located in the West Englewood area of Chicago. I, Malik, would like to own a business that helps poor people out. I, Marcus, would like to become a chef and own my own restaurant. I, Dontonio, would like to either go to college or the military after high school. I, Demarcus, would like to become a comedian or a game show host.</p>
<p>As participants of the the BAM Sports Program, which have helped develop more positive entities within our character, we would like to start our own campaign to fund our after school boxing team, which is managed by great men who work for BAM. The campaign's objective is to raise money to purchase more boxing equipment for BAM's boxing program. We feel if we have more equipment, we can become better boxers.</p>
<p>We are from a community that's impoverished and filled with gun violence. Over the last two years, 30+ students were wounded by gun violence at our school and some did not make it including the girl's star basketball player. Fatal shootings occur in our neighborhoods every other day almost and we want to invest more in something positive like the BAM sports mentoring program. It would be an honor for our contributors to help us fund something that help save lives like it did ours.</p>
<p>As we mentioned to Slava, we need $800 for new equipment for the boxing program. If we receive the funding, the money will go to the BAM Counselor, Mr. Tim Jackson, and he will pass it along to World Sport Chicago's Program Manager Amy Kaufholz, who will make sure the funds will be used for its proper use. As for Perks, we will give a thank you cards, invitations to a BAM Boxing practice, tournaments, and any special events. We will also give special promotional opportunities for corporations. If we don't reach our entire funding goal, whatever money is raised will still be used for boxing equipment and a celebration to honor our efforts and Mr. Jackson for at least trying to accomplish this goal.</p>
<p>""Harper Boxing for BAM"" is a funding project that's giving back to the BAM program. Mr. Jackson, the BAM Counselor here at Harper, has given us his all everyday he's here. He found unique and positive alternatives for us when other staff in the school shunned us away. Mr. Jackson is always consistent and that's what mattered most, so we decided to hopefully give back to the BAM program by raising money to buy extra boxing equipment so the BAM program won't have to spend more money from their budget and they can use that money later for something beneficial. Our project would be valuable to the contributor(s) because they would be helping us achieve a dream. Helping someone achieve a dream is highly comparable to a ""Good Samaritan Act"" and we would perpetually be thankful. Mr. Jackson helps us get closer to achieving our dream step-by-step and we would like to give back to him. One day WE WILL help someone else achieve their dreams.</p>
<p>We are going to ask school administration to help support our cause and our BAM staff is heavily involved for the push of our campaign. Indiegogo is the place to go and you will always remember Malik, Dontonio, Marcus, and Demarcus.</p>

<p><br/><em><span>Cualli Tonalli – No toca Cheli</span></em></p>
<p><i>This means:<em><span>'Good,
beautiful day, my name is Cheli'</span></em> in Nahuatl - the Aztec
language.<br/><br/>
I am currently studying the little known,
ancient Mexican Aztec healing philosophy called Mexihka Pactli. As
one of only a very small number of practitioners in the UK and Austria, I
have a final course in Mexico I must undertake in order to be
fully qualified.<br/><br/>
The course starts on 20th October (2014), which
is why I have set up this crowd funding campaign, in the hope I can
achieve enough funds to pay for my trip and bring this amazing healing
technique back for people in Europe to experience and enjoy.<br/><br/>
Mexihka Pactli is a creative and uniquely
traditional healing medicine. It's based on a philosophy which
helps us live healthily by recovering balance in life, and achieving
harmony with everything around us.<br/><br/>
My studies have been with one of the
leading pioneers for Mexihka Pactli, Eloxochitl Ivonne Margot Buendia
Sanchez, who is based in Mexico and with Xalli responsible for introducing
it to Europe. Eloxochitl is the founder of Calpulli Cencalli, an
organisation which investigates the ancient philosophy and
ensures the learnings continue to be shared and passed on to future
generations. <br/><br/>
To cover the costs for the trip and the course,
it will require me to raise £2,500. If you would like to make a
donation to support me on my journey, I would appreciate it from the
bottom of my heart. All supporters will be honoured with a gift from
Mexico, and I will happily provide a free Mexihka Pactli
treatment in either London or Hamburg for those who pledge £50 or
more, meaning donators will be able to experience this wonderful healing
form first hand.</i></p>

This means:'Good,
beautiful day, my name is Cheli' in Nahuatl - the Aztec
language.
I am currently studying the little known,
ancient Mexican Aztec healing philosophy called Mexihka Pactli. As
one of only a very small number of practitioners in the UK and Austria, I
have a final course in Mexico I must undertake in order to be
fully qualified.
The course starts on 20th October (2014), which
is why I have set up this crowd funding campaign, in the hope I can
achieve enough funds to pay for my trip and bring this amazing healing
technique back for people in Europe to experience and enjoy.
Mexihka Pactli is a creative and uniquely
traditional healing medicine. It's based on a philosophy which
helps us live healthily by recovering balance in life, and achieving
harmony with everything around us.
My studies have been with one of the
leading pioneers for Mexihka Pactli, Eloxochitl Ivonne Margot Buendia
Sanchez, who is based in Mexico and with Xalli responsible for introducing
it to Europe. Eloxochitl is the founder of Calpulli Cencalli, an
organisation which investigates the ancient philosophy and
ensures the learnings continue to be shared and passed on to future
generations. 
To cover the costs for the trip and the course,
it will require me to raise £2,500. If you would like to make a
donation to support me on my journey, I would appreciate it from the
bottom of my heart. All supporters will be honoured with a gift from
Mexico, and I will happily provide a free Mexihka Pactli
treatment in either London or Hamburg for those who pledge £50 or
more, meaning donators will be able to experience this wonderful healing
form first hand.

As the first African-American suburb in the state of Texas, Hamilton Park has a rich history and LEGACY of providing social programs and extracurricular activities to our youth. In recent years funding for these programs has all but diminished leaving our youth drastically under-served. For example, the local recreation center was closed for 9 months last year. The lack of resources and positive programming has produced an environment where youth have resorted to petty crimes, disrespect and a generational disconnect has become the norm. The Legacy Youth Sports and Mentoring program was created to fill this void and address the needs of the youth in our community. Our primary goal is to support the creation of a caring community structure that promotes positive youth development through education and mentoring. Mother Teresa said, “I alone cannot change the world, but I can cast a stone across the waters to create many ripples.” We need your support to reach our goals and make a life long impression on the lives of our children.

</div></div>","My name is Rasheed and I am a proud product of the historic Hamilton Park community. As the first African-American suburb in the state of Texas, Hamilton Park has a rich history and LEGACY of providing social programs and extracurricular activities to our youth. In recent years funding for these programs has all but diminished leaving our youth drastically under-served. For example, the local recreation center was closed for 9 months last year. The lack of resources and positive programming has produced an environment where youth have resorted to petty crimes, disrespect and a generational disconnect has become the norm. The Legacy Youth Sports and Mentoring program was created to fill this void and address the needs of the youth in our community. Our primary goal is to support the creation of a caring community structure that promotes positive youth development through education and mentoring. Mother Teresa said, “I alone cannot change the world, but I can cast a stone across the waters to create many ripples.” We need your support to reach our goals and make a life long impression on the lives of our children. For the record.... I love HAMILTON PARK!!!!
 
Your generous contributions will be used to:

Provide scholarships for registration and uniforms
Purchase equipment and supplies
Rent training facilities and fields

As a small token of apperciation for every donation of $50.00 or more you will receive a Youth Legacy Sports T-shirt. 
 The Impact


The Youth Legacy Sports motto is ""Our legacy is bigger than sports."" We want to drive positive change in the historic Hamilton Park community and unleash the potential of youth through sports. Our approach is based on positive coaching, good sportsmanship, and leadership development through mentoring.We know that the physical, emotional and social benefits to an active lifestyle are a vital component to fostering healthy development in youth. We believe that anything is possible through commitment, passion and effort, and this is the legacy we strive to pass on. 
This year we have conducted three sucessful free football fundemental training camps under the direction of NFL Legend Everson Walls. Youth ages 5-15 showcased their talents and improved their skills through a variety of agility and position specific drills. An article about Youth Legacy Sports was featured in Lake Highlands Today (http://www.lakehighlandstoday.com/index.php/sports/article/legacy_youth_is_bigger_than_sports/) ,

<p><strong>Who we are</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The Nifty MiniDrive was conceived with one thing in mind: pairing the need for extra storage in the MacBook with a design aesthetic worthy of Apple products. We are just two friends who wanted to create something practical that looks damn good.</p>
<p>Please join us on this journey! You will be helping a young company get on its feet for which you cannot underestimate our appreciation. But more importantly you will be part of bringing something useful and beautiful to the world.</p>

<p><strong>What we need</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Our project goal is US$20,000 and is the bare minimum we need to really get this idea off the ground. Your funding will go towards helping us reach the following important milestones:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sourcing and testing the raw materials</li>
<li>Making the first, fully operational prototypes. This will include money for:
<ul>
<li>CNC’d aluminum backs</li>
<li>Double layer PCB’s</li>
<li>Acrylic/Nylon Molded fronts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Placing an order of sufficient volume to scale manufacturing costs</li>
<li>Packaging and Shipping</li>
</ol><div> </div>
<div>However - if we don't reach our funding goal, we will either ship you a Nifty MiniDrive (if that is what you have ordered), or send a full refund, less the 9% indiegogo fee and paypal fees. We wouldn't want you going away empty handed!!</div>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why is it so expensive?</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>We wanted to make the MiniDrive look and feel as high-quality, and as well put together as the MacBook. That meant only one material would do - aircraft grade aluminium. Each MiniDrive is individually machined out of a block of this aluminium using a precision engineering process which gives a high-quality, durable and unique final product. Unfortunately, at low volumes, this is (really) expensive!!</p>
<p>Finally, the MiniDrive is then assembled by hand before being tested and shipped. In these early stages we want to make absolutely sure the quality and finish is to a standard you would be proud to own.</p>

<p>There are not many people like Jared and Ruthie in this world. Jared is an amazing husband, father and friend to many. The irony in this accident is how much Jared has helped others with the work of his hands.

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Jared and Ruthie do not have medical insurance. Their medical bills will be large, and Jared will be unable to work for quite some time. Our goal is to raise as much money as possible to take the burden of medical bills and money off of their shoulders. They will be receiving every penny contributed to this fundraiser. We hope that they will be able to focus on recovering and preparing for their new child. </p>
</div>
<p>It has not yet been determined how many more surgeries Jared will need until he can start his road to recovery. The amount of money required to cover Jared's expenses is unclear because the injury is so recent.  We have set an initial target of $5000 in order to provide assistance quickly.  It is likely that the expenses will continue to grow beyond the fundraiser target.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By donating you will make a huge impact in their lives. We, as a community of people who care for Jared and Ruthie, have an opportunity to help them in a big way.  For this fundraiser to be successful, we are depending on the support of the communities Jared and Ruthie have touched.  The impact of this assistance depends on us, his friends, family, and loved ones.  If we each give a little, together we will play a <strong>big</strong> part in assisting in their recovery.</p>

<h3>Ok, So I am new to this. Never done anything like this. I don't even use Facebook. However I need some help. Here is the reason I am on here.</h3>
<p>Sarah 27 years old. This is my Sister and Mother to my Nephew. She is a Grandaughter, a Great Granddaughter an Aunt and an all around Angel. My Sister was diagnosed with Melanoma a type of Skin cancer that if left untreated can be deadly. She has been in for two treatments so far that involve alot of pain, cutting and scarring. The problem being is she has no Health Insurance and is on the verge of losing her home. She has the choice of either spending her paycheck on her home or treatments. She is a hard working Mom. She is struggling to make the money for treatments and if left untreated it will progress.</p>
<p>She is not the type of person to ask for money or help so I am going to do it for. I want her to be able to know she is going to be able to afford to get the help she needs and keep a roof over her head. I know she is having troubles with all of it and I don't want to see her worry and suffer anymore.</p>
<p>It hurts me to see her like this. It bothers me that she is going to be scarred, it doesn't seem fair. If I could switch places with her I would but I know its not going to happen. But I'm here to support her and I know she is strong and can do this.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My goal is to earn enough help that it will pay for her treatments and leave her with enough of her pay check to cover her mortgage and utilities, food etc.</p>
<p>I love my sister, she has a heart of gold. She is an honest, loving, caring person. She has been there for every member of my family at different points of our lives. She would give the shirt off her back for someone that needed help. </p>
<p>I don't know why bad things happen to good people. Maybe its a test of someones strengths. It's are human nature to survive and she is a surviver. I know she will make it through this and times are tough for everyone. But with a little help, I honestly think it will go a long way. Any little bit helps and will be truely appreciated and used for a good cause.</p>

</p><p>Race Across America (RAAM) is one the most respected and longest running endurance sports events in the world. RAAM is seen as a pinnacle of athletic achievement not only in cycling circles but the greater sporting community as well.</p>
<p>RAAM has a rich and storied history. In 1982 four individuals raced from the Santa Monica Pier in Los Angeles to the Empire State Building in New York City.

<p><b>RAAM is a race!</b> But unlike the three great European Grand Tours (Tour de France, Vuelta a España and Giro de Italia), RAAM is not a stage race.

<p>Racers must traverse 3000 miles across 12 states and climb over 170,000 vertical feet. Team racers have a maximum of nine days and most finish in about seven and a half days.

<ul>
<li>My name is Frank, My uncle Roger has worked all his life.  He started driving Buses and then Tractor trailers when he first received his license. He also constructed many homes as a volunteer for Habitat for Humanity.</li>
<li>This campaign was started to help Uncle Roger during his cancer recovery and other situations that follow his surgery that left my uncle homeless and now jobless with a disable nephew also homeless.  It hurts Roger to ask for help from anyone, he has work most of his life., Now he finds his self and nephew needing help</li>
<li>Help receive from contributors will help us find a low income home and my uncle can continue his care of himself and of my traumatic brain Injury.  He can also recover from a very painful surgery and he can return to work.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>As a thanks to anyone who helps with comments, suggestions, share ideas or that would just like a small token of my appreciation, I will send a comic book from my collection.   The comic book is a small way of saying Thank You from the bottom of my hearth.   I have a huge collection that a friend agreed to store for me temporarily.  I no longer have a home to keep something that has giving me so much joy reading during the years and It will make me happy to share them with other to enjoy.  My comic book collection has been part of my life for many years and was the only thing that I did not lose because a college friend stored them in his basement.   My name is Frankie.   My uncle name Rog is my best friend and only family member.   Rog and I have shared an apartment for 17 years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rog has truly helped so many people during the years.  I have never heard him say no to anyone needing help.  He is very receptive and has always been there for anyone needing him in our community.  He has been working since he was 16 and for the last 18 years he has work driving trucks over the road, as a truck and bus instructor and as a safety officer training workers at the ports.  In his spear time and as a hobby, Rog fixes homes for those needing him in our community. He learned construction skills by volunteering for habitat for humanity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I suffered a traumatic brain injury while I was completing my medical school degree.  The injuries left me totally disable.  Rog has been there for me and has support me in many ways.  He makes sure people understand my injury and many times he has prevented kids in the neighborhood from making fun of me.  He educated people in stores and places we go.  He tells them my speech impediment was because of a traumatic brain injury and to please have a little patience.  He reminds me of all my medical appointments.  He takes me to my appointments and when he is not able to, he makes arrangement so that I could get to my appointment safely.     He fixed our apartment to prevent and minimize me from obtaining any further injury.  He fixed our cabinet to automatically close so that I won’t leave them open and bang my head on them.   He placed guards in dangerous pointy areas on the furniture.   He placed padding in the small patio in the apartment so that I won’t suffer an injury.  He saw me through many seizures, cluster headaches and narcolepsy. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I had a dark room that he set up for me to get over the migraines that last days.   Roger found ways that made it easy for me to learn and remember things again and he shared many methods with my doctor’s traumatic brain Injury group.    Rog did all this while juggling between work and making sure that I was safe and he did it all with patience and a smile.  On his own time he helps other young people interested in learning to drive trucks and buses. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rog also help many people who could not afford truck driving school and he never asked nor expected anything in return.  Rog words to me where, it is so satisfying when I see these students driving with a good paying profession and they say, thanks Rog.  He always stressed to the younger kids that staying in school and haven a profession is the best thing they can do.  Rog always believe that no matter how bad things get that live move forward and things get better.  The only dream that I have heard Rog tell me is that he wishes that one day we could have our own home, and that he will continue to work every day that he can to make that dream one day come true.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rog was diagnosed with cancer in the buttock region going upward to the coccyx bone in the lower spine.  The cancerous tissue was all removed leaving an injury that was not healing quickly.  A very huge amount of tissue was removed from one side of the buttock and some from the other and a small amount near the lower spine. .</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rog lost his job during his recovery, and in the meantime 5 months had passed and I was doing my best taken care of the rent and the bills. Rog knew it was impossible for me to pay everything by myself and against doctors’ orders he started searching for a job.  During the medical exam that truck drivers are required to have; he continuously failed them because the surgical injury was still raw and open.  No matter how hard I tried, I was approximately 3 months at this point behind on the rental responsibilities. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The landlord took us to court.   Although, the judge knew that I was permanently disable and she saw all the paper work for Rog cancer surgery, there was nothing she could do.  The judge was sympathetic and told Rog that if the landlord could not make an arrangement with us then she had no other options but to issue an evict order.  After living in this same place for 10 years, and never once being late before, the landlord did not reach an agreement that we could meet and an eviction order was issue. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We were giving 24 hours to vacate the premises and 7 days to remove our things from the apartment.  We both had no money at all because we had giving the landlord 1 month and owe them an additional 2 months.  The landlord had proceeded with the eviction order. We slept 8 days in an old car that Rog had at the complex’s parking lot. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>All our things were thrown in the garbage because we had no money for storage or a truck to move the things from the apartment.  The complex towed the car out of their property.  That same day I manage to receive my disability check direct deposit.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I used my monthly disability check to get a room at Extended Stay America.  The room has a two eye stove and a refrigerator. I paid for a10 day at 81.00 a day and I bought a little food that way we can cook and don’t have to buy takeout food.  Rog has been looking for a job and at this point he is willing to accept any job available so that we could get out of this terrible situation.  Rog has attended various interviews in the bus/ truck business but due to the physical requirements that are required by a physician, Rog continuously fail the physical.    </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The worse of what we are going through is that I know it only a matter of days, before we have to go back to the streets.   I am so scared because the car we slept in is no longer available and the temperatures have dropped.  I never taught that we would end up in such a helpless, hurtful, and terrible situation.  We lost the only place that we could call home, and everything that we had worked so hard to obtain over so many years.  I see the hurt in my uncle Rog eyes and he sees it in mines.    Rog tries to make me feel better by saying that the things we have lost were only material things. </p>
<p>A lifetime of pictures, books that I loved so much, furniture that were extremely hard to obtain, and so many things, are all gone.  It is so hard that I just don’t want to even think of it because it hurts too much.  The most important thing to me at this time is haven a place to sleep, cook and not be in the street. I am so scared for me and my uncle.  We only have a few days left at this place and no way to extend or stay.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The situation is almost hopeless.  I am trying to find a place that I could afford by myself for me and my uncle.   It pains me because Rog is doing everything he can to find a job again.  He tells me that he will work until he dies and he is attempting to find any available employment.     I am haven a very difficult time finding a rental because the landlord placed an eviction judgment in our records.  Bus service is so limited in the area that we are staying and we are haven difficulties moving around. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>What make this situation even more injurious and devastating is that we were told to call the department of social services and explain our situation in detail.  Rog called the state help number first before we lost our apartment and he explained the situation.   They made an appointment to come in and see a worker at emergency services.  Rog waited for 3 hours and the worker made him fill out a ton of forms. Rog felt embarrassed and humiliated because he has worked all his life. Rog was told he did not qualify for help to prevent eviction because the emergency service funds were only for people who received welfare.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We were evicted and lost everything and are currently staying in a hotel like studio.  I called social service and we explain the situation.  I asked them is there any way we can be assisted in finding a roof over our heads.  I explain that we were currently staying in a furnished room with stove refrigerator and if they could assist me with a partial voucher because my disability monthly income was only enough to cover 10 days at the cheapest location I was able to find.  I explain it was for a short time providing us time to find an affordable place to rent and given Rog time to find a job.  Rog is willing to start working immediately regardless of his medical condition.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Social Service exact words, we understand that your uncle Rog is your care taker and you have a permanent disability but we have no provision for the disable in this state.  Your uncle has been taken care of you for the last 10 years and what we do in a case like this is send you to a shelter and send him to another shelter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Furthermore we have no control of the shelter that your uncle goes to and which one you go to.  Social Service went on to say, be aware that the shelters make you get up in the morning and you are not allow back in until 5:00pm.   Something is extremely wrong with what two different governmental agencies have said to me and Uncle Rog. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Uncle Rog has taken care of me and I depend on his care.  He reminds me where I am at during a seizure.  He feeds me when I am force to be incapacitated in bed 2 and 3 times a week with debilitating cluster headaches. Uncle Rog calls my doctor and that make sure I am in dark quiet room.  Rog cooks and watch over me so that I don’t accidentally hurt myself.   Uncle Rog knows when I am haven a narcolepsy episode.  He had made our apartment safe to prevent further injury or accidents when he was at work.  He had our apartment equipped with cameras that he access from his phone.   He monitors my medications and make sure I take them as instructed by my specialist.  Uncle has been taken care of me for the last 13 years.  He has dedicated himself to make sure I was well taken care off and at the same time allow him to have his career.   It has taken years to form this Symbian relationship. The type of environment that social service is suggesting would be devastating to my health.  Rog does not even want to think about such an arrangement.  My specialist of 13 years is extremely concern about my care.  I quote my doctor when he says that I will decompensate and all the hard work and progress would be lost. He does not understand how could something so outrageous even be suggested or consider with a traumatic brain injured individual that has been declare permanently disable.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rog goals were to have the cancer surgery and allow his wound to heal.  He then was going to get a second job to save everything he made for a year because he wanted to buy a cheap fixer upper house and use his skills to fix it, one room at a time. Now that we are homeless I find myself thinking of anything that would have given us a roof over our heads.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I also think of Rog desperation shortly after surgery of wanting to return to work.  It has been 6 months after Rog had the surgery and wound care has not clear him because the wound area continues to rip.  Rog has not followed doctor’s orders.  He has been looking for a job and riding the bus all over sitting for hours.  Rog after taken the bus walks for miles to locations with no bus trying to find a job.   My uncle has slept uncomfortable in a car and it made it hard caring for the wound.   Uncle has not been eating properly, and has done very little bed rest as order by his cancer Surgeon. The pic is the removal of cancerous tissue from the buttocks to the lower spine.  I asked God to please save my uncle and let all the mutated cells be gone.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I want him to get better and for his wound to heal.  Our time here at Extended Stay is limited and I am asking for any type of help.  Your help will really be appreciated and will never be forgotten.  I thank you from the bottom of my hearth.  Any help would truly be appreciated by me and uncle Rog. And you will receive per your request a comic book from my collection</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you friends</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>The funds I need is $20.000 this will be used to prevent us from returning back to the streets, to allow my uncle to fully recover, to find an affordable home, for transportation expenses to medical appointments and to help and bring attention towards the lack of resources available to help families in preventing homelessness and the loss of everything due to cancer.</li>
<li>In return for your thankful contribution you will receive a classic comic book from my old collection all comic books are in excellent to good conditions. The more you contribute the more classic comic you will receive.</li>
<li>Obtaining our goal will pay for as long as needed to continue to stay at Extended Stay America while my uncle Rog recover and it will also keep us warm and out of the streets.  It will also help us locate an apartment that I can afford and that the landlord would rent to us. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>In my search to find help for people experiencing the loss of their livelihood due to becoming ill because of Cancer, I found no agency or organizations that provide assistance.</li>
<li>I was surprise that in our country an illness can drive hard working individuals to become homeless overnight.  I was shock to learn that only people receiving welfare can qualify for a small stipend to prevent homelessness.  Those like us who are not in a governmental program and who have worked all our life are denied any type of funds.  </li>
<li>Your contribution will make a big difference in helping my Uncle Roger recover from cancer and provide us a temporary place to stay.  It will also allow us to find an affordable apartment.  It will prevent a separation of my care taker from me for no fault of our own.   It will provide peace of mind that my uncle may continue his treatment and recovery without the stressed and the desperation of finding employment, even though, the surgeon has not clear him to return to work.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>My goal is to temporarily fund where me and Rog are staying which is Extended Stay America.  I have been looking desperately for a Rental that I can pay on my own without Rog.  I want to give him time to Heal and to find employment.  Rog’s goal is to find employment immediately because of our current situation.  Although Rog is still in the recovery process, he feels he has no choice but to find a job.  Haven been in med school for two year and I was just months from starting my third before my Traumatic Brain Injury, I notice that Rog surgical injury is not healing properly.  I am concern about a few areas that appear like abscesses that are indicative of a reoccurrence of cancerous cells.  I am trying to help so that he could feel comfortable enough, that our homeless situation is resolved.  I want Rog to go back to the surgical Oncologist for further treatment without the immediate worries of haven surgery or treatment without a home.  I have personally experience that there is no help for our situation.  There are many agencies but they do not provide direct help to those that need help when they have cancer and become homeless because of cancer and other disorders. It is my hope that if I can raise enough funds to get out of our immediate situation that I can use any extra funds raise to directly help others that become homeless because of cancer treatment.  It is so important to prevent homelessness before it occurs because after the fact it is so difficult to have a disease and to be homeless simultaneously.  The goal should be homelessness prevention to help those who have cancer and become homeless find a place to live.   Agencies exist to help with the free treatment of cancer but none help those that become homeless because of the disease.  Helping this specific group who work hard all there live and because of cancer become homeless or that are at risk of becoming homeless due to cancer is truly a worthy cause that I cannot ignore.    What do you receive for your help?</p>
<p>You will receive comic book from my classic collection.   </p>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>It is imperative that we bring attention to cancer, treatment, employment and homelessness.  We often give donations to big corporations that do not offer help to those that have to make a choice between their job and receiving lifesaving treatment.</li>
<li>It is my hope that more people can speak up about this issue that so many experienced without having a place to turn for help.  Research is very important. Aggressive treatment and hope is important. I have learned that there are many heroes that provide excellent research and even free treatment for those with cancer. </li>
<li>I have also learned and realized that like us this disease can destroy a family unit and leave them homeless with no way to turn.  We really need organizations that can make it their mission to help people seek treatment without sacrificing everything they have and becoming homeless in the process.</li>
<li>I am ready to make it my mission to overcome this situation with contributors help and to offer help to others that are in the same situation that we are experiencing. We must speak up loud and clear to everyone who can listen.  We should make everyone aware of the existence and need to a situation that anyone can experience. </li>
<li>We should encouraged the treatment of cancer and assure the patients that they will not lose their home, family and employment during their treatment.</li>
</ul>

I suffered a traumatic brain injury while I was completing my medical school degree.  The injuries left me totally disable.  Rog has been there for me and has support me in many ways.  He makes sure people understand my injury and many times he has prevented kids in the neighborhood from making fun of me.  He educated people in stores and places we go.  He tells them my speech impediment was because of a traumatic brain injury and to please have a little patience.  He reminds me of all my medical appointments.  He takes me to my appointments and when he is not able to, he makes arrangement so that I could get to my appointment safely.     He fixed our apartment to prevent and minimize me from obtaining any further injury.  He fixed our cabinet to automatically close so that I won’t leave them open and bang my head on them.   He placed guards in dangerous pointy areas on the furniture.   He placed padding in the small patio in the apartment so that I won’t suffer an injury.  He saw me through many seizures, cluster headaches and narcolepsy. 
 
I had a dark room that he set up for me to get over the migraines that last days.   Roger found ways that made it easy for me to learn and remember things again and he shared many methods with my doctor’s traumatic brain Injury group.    Rog did all this while juggling between work and making sure that I was safe and he did it all with patience and a smile.  On his own time he helps other young people interested in learning to drive trucks and buses. 
 
Rog also help many people who could not afford truck driving school and he never asked nor expected anything in return.  Rog words to me where, it is so satisfying when I see these students driving with a good paying profession and they say, thanks Rog.  He always stressed to the younger kids that staying in school and haven a profession is the best thing they can do.  Rog always believe that no matter how bad things get that live move forward and things get better.  The only dream that I have heard Rog tell me is that he wishes that one day we could have our own home, and that he will continue to work every day that he can to make that dream one day come true.
 
Rog was diagnosed with cancer in the buttock region going upward to the coccyx bone in the lower spine.  The cancerous tissue was all removed leaving an injury that was not healing quickly.  A very huge amount of tissue was removed from one side of the buttock and some from the other and a small amount near the lower spine. .
 
Rog lost his job during his recovery, and in the meantime 5 months had passed and I was doing my best taken care of the rent and the bills. Rog knew it was impossible for me to pay everything by myself and against doctors’ orders he started searching for a job.  During the medical exam that truck drivers are required to have; he continuously failed them because the surgical injury was still raw and open.  No matter how hard I tried, I was approximately 3 months at this point behind on the rental responsibilities. 
 
The landlord took us to court.   Although, the judge knew that I was permanently disable and she saw all the paper work for Rog cancer surgery, there was nothing she could do.  The judge was sympathetic and told Rog that if the landlord could not make an arrangement with us then she had no other options but to issue an evict order.  After living in this same place for 10 years, and never once being late before, the landlord did not reach an agreement that we could meet and an eviction order was issue. 
 
We were giving 24 hours to vacate the premises and 7 days to remove our things from the apartment.  We both had no money at all because we had giving the landlord 1 month and owe them an additional 2 months.  The landlord had proceeded with the eviction order. We slept 8 days in an old car that Rog had at the complex’s parking lot. 
 
All our things were thrown in the garbage because we had no money for storage or a truck to move the things from the apartment.  The complex towed the car out of their property.  That same day I manage to receive my disability check direct deposit.  
 
I used my monthly disability check to get a room at Extended Stay America.  The room has a two eye stove and a refrigerator. I paid for a10 day at 81.00 a day and I bought a little food that way we can cook and don’t have to buy takeout food.  Rog has been looking for a job and at this point he is willing to accept any job available so that we could get out of this terrible situation.  Rog has attended various interviews in the bus/ truck business but due to the physical requirements that are required by a physician, Rog continuously fail the physical.    
 
The worse of what we are going through is that I know it only a matter of days, before we have to go back to the streets.   I am so scared because the car we slept in is no longer available and the temperatures have dropped.  I never taught that we would end up in such a helpless, hurtful, and terrible situation.  We lost the only place that we could call home, and everything that we had worked so hard to obtain over so many years.  I see the hurt in my uncle Rog eyes and he sees it in mines.    Rog tries to make me feel better by saying that the things we have lost were only material things. 
A lifetime of pictures, books that I loved so much, furniture that were extremely hard to obtain, and so many things, are all gone.  It is so hard that I just don’t want to even think of it because it hurts too much.  The most important thing to me at this time is haven a place to sleep, cook and not be in the street. I am so scared for me and my uncle.  We only have a few days left at this place and no way to extend or stay.
 
The situation is almost hopeless.  I am trying to find a place that I could afford by myself for me and my uncle.   It pains me because Rog is doing everything he can to find a job again.  He tells me that he will work until he dies and he is attempting to find any available employment.     I am haven a very difficult time finding a rental because the landlord placed an eviction judgment in our records.  Bus service is so limited in the area that we are staying and we are haven difficulties moving around. 
 
What make this situation even more injurious and devastating is that we were told to call the department of social services and explain our situation in detail.  Rog called the state help number first before we lost our apartment and he explained the situation.   They made an appointment to come in and see a worker at emergency services.  Rog waited for 3 hours and the worker made him fill out a ton of forms. Rog felt embarrassed and humiliated because he has worked all his life. Rog was told he did not qualify for help to prevent eviction because the emergency service funds were only for people who received welfare.
 
We were evicted and lost everything and are currently staying in a hotel like studio.  I called social service and we explain the situation.  I asked them is there any way we can be assisted in finding a roof over our heads.  I explain that we were currently staying in a furnished room with stove refrigerator and if they could assist me with a partial voucher because my disability monthly income was only enough to cover 10 days at the cheapest location I was able to find.  I explain it was for a short time providing us time to find an affordable place to rent and given Rog time to find a job.  Rog is willing to start working immediately regardless of his medical condition.
 
Social Service exact words, we understand that your uncle Rog is your care taker and you have a permanent disability but we have no provision for the disable in this state.  Your uncle has been taken care of you for the last 10 years and what we do in a case like this is send you to a shelter and send him to another shelter.
 
Furthermore we have no control of the shelter that your uncle goes to and which one you go to.  Social Service went on to say, be aware that the shelters make you get up in the morning and you are not allow back in until 5:00pm.   Something is extremely wrong with what two different governmental agencies have said to me and Uncle Rog. 
 
Uncle Rog has taken care of me and I depend on his care.  He reminds me where I am at during a seizure.  He feeds me when I am force to be incapacitated in bed 2 and 3 times a week with debilitating cluster headaches. Uncle Rog calls my doctor and that make sure I am in dark quiet room.  Rog cooks and watch over me so that I don’t accidentally hurt myself.   Uncle Rog knows when I am haven a narcolepsy episode.  He had made our apartment safe to prevent further injury or accidents when he was at work.  He had our apartment equipped with cameras that he access from his phone.   He monitors my medications and make sure I take them as instructed by my specialist.  Uncle has been taken care of me for the last 13 years.  He has dedicated himself to make sure I was well taken care off and at the same time allow him to have his career.   It has taken years to form this Symbian relationship. The type of environment that social service is suggesting would be devastating to my health.  Rog does not even want to think about such an arrangement.  My specialist of 13 years is extremely concern about my care.  I quote my doctor when he says that I will decompensate and all the hard work and progress would be lost. He does not understand how could something so outrageous even be suggested or consider with a traumatic brain injured individual that has been declare permanently disable.   
 
Rog goals were to have the cancer surgery and allow his wound to heal.  He then was going to get a second job to save everything he made for a year because he wanted to buy a cheap fixer upper house and use his skills to fix it, one room at a time. Now that we are homeless I find myself thinking of anything that would have given us a roof over our heads.  
 
I also think of Rog desperation shortly after surgery of wanting to return to work.  It has been 6 months after Rog had the surgery and wound care has not clear him because the wound area continues to rip.  Rog has not followed doctor’s orders.  He has been looking for a job and riding the bus all over sitting for hours.  Rog after taken the bus walks for miles to locations with no bus trying to find a job.   My uncle has slept uncomfortable in a car and it made it hard caring for the wound.   Uncle has not been eating properly, and has done very little bed rest as order by his cancer Surgeon. The pic is the removal of cancerous tissue from the buttocks to the lower spine.  I asked God to please save my uncle and let all the mutated cells be gone.  
 
I want him to get better and for his wound to heal.  Our time here at Extended Stay is limited and I am asking for any type of help.  Your help will really be appreciated and will never be forgotten.  I thank you from the bottom of my hearth.  Any help would truly be appreciated by me and uncle Rog. And you will receive per your request a comic book from my collection
 
 
Thank you friends
 
 
 

What We Need & What You Get
 

The funds I need is $20.000 this will be used to prevent us from returning back to the streets, to allow my uncle to fully recover, to find an affordable home, for transportation expenses to medical appointments and to help and bring attention towards the lack of resources available to help families in preventing homelessness and the loss of everything due to cancer.
In return for your thankful contribution you will receive a classic comic book from my old collection all comic books are in excellent to good conditions. The more you contribute the more classic comic you will receive.
Obtaining our goal will pay for as long as needed to continue to stay at Extended Stay America while my uncle Rog recover and it will also keep us warm and out of the streets.  It will also help us locate an apartment that I can afford and that the landlord would rent to us. 


The Impact
 

In my search to find help for people experiencing the loss of their livelihood due to becoming ill because of Cancer, I found no agency or organizations that provide assistance.
I was surprise that in our country an illness can drive hard working individuals to become homeless overnight.  I was shock to learn that only people receiving welfare can qualify for a small stipend to prevent homelessness.  Those like us who are not in a governmental program and who have worked all our life are denied any type of funds.  
Your contribution will make a big difference in helping my Uncle Roger recover from cancer and provide us a temporary place to stay.  It will also allow us to find an affordable apartment.  It will prevent a separation of my care taker from me for no fault of our own.   It will provide peace of mind that my uncle may continue his treatment and recovery without the stressed and the desperation of finding employment, even though, the surgeon has not clear him to return to work.
 
My goal is to temporarily fund where me and Rog are staying which is Extended Stay America.  I have been looking desperately for a Rental that I can pay on my own without Rog.  I want to give him time to Heal and to find employment.  Rog’s goal is to find employment immediately because of our current situation.  Although Rog is still in the recovery process, he feels he has no choice but to find a job.  Haven been in med school for two year and I was just months from starting my third before my Traumatic Brain Injury, I notice that Rog surgical injury is not healing properly.  I am concern about a few areas that appear like abscesses that are indicative of a reoccurrence of cancerous cells.  I am trying to help so that he could feel comfortable enough, that our homeless situation is resolved.  I want Rog to go back to the surgical Oncologist for further treatment without the immediate worries of haven surgery or treatment without a home.  I have personally experience that there is no help for our situation.  There are many agencies but they do not provide direct help to those that need help when they have cancer and become homeless because of cancer and other disorders. It is my hope that if I can raise enough funds to get out of our immediate situation that I can use any extra funds raise to directly help others that become homeless because of cancer treatment.  It is so important to prevent homelessness before it occurs because after the fact it is so difficult to have a disease and to be homeless simultaneously.  The goal should be homelessness prevention to help those who have cancer and become homeless find a place to live.   Agencies exist to help with the free treatment of cancer but none help those that become homeless because of the disease.  Helping this specific group who work hard all there live and because of cancer become homeless or that are at risk of becoming homeless due to cancer is truly a worthy cause that I cannot ignore.    What do you receive for your help?
You will receive comic book from my classic collection.   

Other Ways You Can Help
 

It is imperative that we bring attention to cancer, treatment, employment and homelessness.  We often give donations to big corporations that do not offer help to those that have to make a choice between their job and receiving lifesaving treatment.
It is my hope that more people can speak up about this issue that so many experienced without having a place to turn for help.  Research is very important. Aggressive treatment and hope is important. I have learned that there are many heroes that provide excellent research and even free treatment for those with cancer. 
I have also learned and realized that like us this disease can destroy a family unit and leave them homeless with no way to turn.  We really need organizations that can make it their mission to help people seek treatment without sacrificing everything they have and becoming homeless in the process.
I am ready to make it my mission to overcome this situation with contributors help and to offer help to others that are in the same situation that we are experiencing. We must speak up loud and clear to everyone who can listen.  We should make everyone aware of the existence and need to a situation that anyone can experience. 
We should encouraged the treatment of cancer and assure the patients that they will not lose their home, family and employment during their treatment.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</div></div>","Leaf & Love Organic Lemonade was created when we (Amy and Sara- friends since childhood) took to our kitchens to develop a tasty, organic, zero-grams-of-sugar lemonade. We were sick and tired of children’s beverages filled with sugar, artificial sweeteners, and crazy ingredients we couldn’t pronounce! Yet, at nearly every birthday party, playdate or sporting event, our kids were drinking typical juice boxes while we cringed at the thought of all that sugar.  The latest research is showing that even 100% juice is nearly as detrimental as sugar-filled drinks, as far as how our bodies respond to it.
We couldn’t be more excited to bring a better beverage to families everywhere. Leaf & Love Organic Lemonade offers the perfect balance of sweet and sensible in every box!




Left: Sara and Allie Lou at Oakland Children’s Hospital at diagnosisLeaf & Love was largely inspired after Sara’s daughter, Allie Lou, was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at age three. Type 1 diabetes is an auto-immune disease which is not caused by eating too much sugar, but it does require the child keep a tight balance of carbohydrate/sugar intake and insulin injections. Happily, now Allie Lou can enjoy a refreshing, zero-sugar, 2 carb lemonade anywhere she pleases!
Right: Julian and Amy, Mother’s Day 2014Leaf & Love was also inspired by Amy’s perpetual search for wholesome and delicious nutrition that wouldn’t have her four-year-old son Julian bouncing off the walls all day long! Now, Amy doesn’t think twice about offering Julian and his buddies this yummy treat, and the other parents couldn’t be happier.




Are you ready for the scary truth? A study conducted by the American Heart Association found that children as young as 3 years old already bypass the daily recommendation of 3-4 teaspoons (10-12 grams) of added sugar per day. This age group typically consumes around 12 teaspoons of sugar a day. That translates to 48 grams of added sugar every day or a minimum of 38 pounds of added sugar every year!  We bet you would be shocked to find that even some of even the “healthiest” food and beverages marketed to kids sneak sugar into their ingredient panels.

Leaf & Love Organic Lemonade is a category creator! We are the first all-natural, organic and zero-grams-of-sugar juice box for families.
We went through several rounds of formulation and taste-testing to ensure that our beverage would be highly appealing to kids.


Leaf & Love is:

USDA Certified Organic
5 calories/2 carbs per box
Non-Gmo
Vegan
Low Glycemic Index
Gluten-Free
Sweetened using only the highest quality organic stevia leaf extract

<h4>Timeline</h4>
<p>The Palo Alto Longevity Prize ends on September 9th, 2018. So we have to get the ball rolling quickly if we are to meet the requirements to win the prize. Our experiment will begin on July 1st, 2015 with the first 4 groups of mice, plus the control group. Groups 5 &amp; 6 should be born sometime in January or February, 2016.</p>
<p>If all goes well, on September 9th, 2018, the mice from groups 1 &amp; 2 will be 1,678 days old. Groups 3 &amp; 4 will be 1,439 days old. If 10% of any of these groups is still alive on this date then Team CPMC will qualify to win the Longevity Demonstration Prize.</p>
<p>Groups 5 &amp; 6 will reach world record age of 1,819 days + 1 day, some time in February, 2021.</p>The maximum length of project is approximately 5 Years, 8 Months.<br/>

You Might Be Suffering From A Cannabinoid Deficiency
All animals (including you) have an Endocannabinoid System. This recently discovered physiologic system plays an essential role in regulating overall health and wellness in the body. When the system breaks down, the result can be injury, disease and death. Clinical Endocannabinoid Deficiency (CECD) has been implicated in the development of a growing list of aging-associated diseases such as Type-2 Diabetes, Alzheimer's Disease, Inflammatory Diseases, Heart Disease and Cancer. What if we could eliminate this deficiency by replacing our body's lost ""endo"" cannabinoids with plant based, ""phyto"" cannabinoids? Could we slow the aging process and add a significant number of healthy years to the average human lifespan? We need your help to find out.Using Cannabinoids To Extend Lifespan in MiceTeam CPMC will be competing for the Palo Alto Longevity Prize. The Palo Alto Longevity Prize is a $1 million life science competition dedicated to ending aging. Team CPMC was assembled to compete for the Longevity Prize by attempting to raise the world's oldest and healthiest laboratory mouse! 

Drs. Sean McAllister Ph.D & Pierre Desprez Ph.D are scientists at the California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute and are the lead researchers for Team CPMC.
We designed this experiement to determine whether two compounds found in the cannabis plant, Cannabidiol (CDB) and Delta-9 Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) can be effective in treating Clinical Endocannabinoid Deficiency and extend healthy life in mice.



                         

              
Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-toxic, phytocannabinoid that is increasingly being used in food and medicine. THC, another well known phytocannabinoid, may be taken orally in food or as medicine and has also been proposed to enhance the therapeutic effects of CBD.
Due to CBD's wide range of pharmacological effects as well as its antioxidant properties, our hypothesis is that CBD administrated orally, as sesame oil pellets, in combination (or not) with THC, in young, middle-aged or old mice will significantly increase their lifespan. Let's see if we can break the record for the world's oldest-ever living mouse!
Does this mean that our mice will get ""high"" from the THC? The answer is NO. CBD is known to counteract the psychoactive effects of THC. Because our mice will always receive much more CBD than THC, we don't expect them to experience any psychoactive effects what-so-ever. Our mice will be happy, but not that happy!
The total cost for this project is estimated to be $177,000, including a $2000 registration fee for the competition. The experiment will be conducted using 105 mice assigned to 7 different experimental groups. 15 mice per group. Including three groups treated with CBD, three groups treated with CBD and THC. And one control group.

Groups 1 & 2 will determine the potential effects of CBD and CBD in combination with THC, on lifespan in 16 month old female C57BL/6 mice.
Groups 3 & 4 will use 9 month old mice that will receive the cannabinoid therapy for 6 months before being allowed to reproduce.
Group 5 & 6 will include the offspring of the mice from groups 3 & 4. This group will receive the cannabinoid therapy from utero to end-of-life.
Group 7 is the control group.
The mice will be kept in plastic cages containing sawdust bedding (4 mice per cage) in an animal holding room that will be maintained at 21–24°C and 40–60% relative humidity with a 12 hour light/dark cycle. The mice will be provided food (Purina Certified Laboratory Chow), plenty of water and all the exercise they need.

We Have 2 Chances To Win!
The Palo Alto Longevity Prize is actually 2 prizes. A  $500,000 Homeostatic Capacity Prize will be awarded to the first team to demonstrate that it can restore the health of an aging mammal to that of a young adult.

A $500,000 Longevity Demonstration Prize will be awarded to the first team that can extend the lifespan of its animal by 50% of the accepted published norms. To qualify to win this prize at least 10% of our mice will need to survive beyond 1,425 days. 


We believe that by attempting to break the record for the oldest-ever living mouse, we will be in an excellent position to win both prizes. The current record holder was a genetically engineered mouse that lived for 1,819 days. To break that record, at least one of our mice will have to exceed that record by one day for a total of 1,820 days.



Timeline
The Palo Alto Longevity Prize ends on September 9th, 2018. So we have to get the ball rolling quickly if we are to meet the requirements to win the prize. Our experiment will begin on July 1st, 2015 with the first 4 groups of mice, plus the control group. Groups 5 & 6 should be born sometime in January or February, 2016.
If all goes well, on September 9th, 2018, the mice from groups 1 & 2 will be 1,678 days old. Groups 3 & 4 will be 1,439 days old. If 10% of any of these groups is still alive on this date then Team CPMC will qualify to win the Longevity Demonstration Prize.
Groups 5 & 6 will reach world record age of 1,819 days + 1 day, some time in February, 2021.The maximum length of project is approximately 5 Years, 8 Months.


Real Science, Real Life Implications.



The use of cannabinoids in food and medicine has increased significantly over the past decade and promises only to become more widespread as doctors recommend medical cannabis for an ever-increasing number of ailments. But the long term effects of phytocannabinoids in our diet needs to be better understood.We expect this project to yield a wealth of useful data on the relationship between cannabinoids and the diseases associated with aging. But the project also promises to be great fun! The Palo Alto Longevity Prize is a competition designed to produce a quantum leap in regenerative medicine. So in the spirit of that competition (and human progress) Team CPMC is on a mission to produce the world's oldest-ever mouse and win that prize! But we need your help to do it!

Utilising specially developed materials, constructed in a unique pattern design, the materials offer a further level of pinpointed support and heat where you need it most, in conjunction with our soft-stick panelling to replicate how Kinesiology tape interacts with the skin, without the need to have a trained individual applying the tape, or the uncomfortable peeling off of the tape. The garment slides on and off without irritation, whilst providing Kinesiology tape and Compression garment like benefits, all in one from fitting streamline garment we call ReForm. Muscle injuries are a huge part of our livesWe've combined the best features of both Compression wear ad Kinesiology TapeYou may be wonderingK- TAPE is a rehabilitative taping technique that is designed to facilitate the body’s natural healing process while providing support and stability to muscles and joints without restricting the body’s range of motion as well as providing extended soft tissue manipulation to prolong the benefits of manual therapy administered within the clinical setting.It really is a brilliant piece of kit, however timely to apply, requiring a trained individual to apply it correctly, and very costly when used a lot. It’s often not viable for many, ReForm brings you the same principles in an easy to apply garment offering the benefits of both Kinesiology tape, and compression wear in one streamlined garment. ReForm’s dual layered Lycra backed material grips the skin where you need it most to offer support never felt before in a compression garment WHY ARE WE ON INDIEGOGO?We’ve seen how supportive you the Indiegogo community are, and now is when we need your help.

</div> <div> <h3>Why This is Important</h3> <p>We all know that getting injured is something that can happen when you play sports. In fact, 1 in 5 ER visits in the US are related to sports, resulting in &gt;$33 billion spent on direct medical costs for those injuries. While a good percentage of those injuries aren't preventable (like a resistance band breaking unexpectedly or getting tackled), many injuries can be prevented with proper training regimens. Let's take the example of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. Over 200,000 happen in organized US sports each year, and the average surgical repair is $27,000! Using proper warm up and training techniques, however, such as the FIFA 11 regimen in soccer, can prevent 30-50% of ACL injuries with the added bonus of a significant improvement in agility, maximal oxygen use, and overall performance. </p>
<p>A lot of people don't know about that, though, and we want to change that. Don't you want to know that you, and the athletes and fitness enthusiasts you love, are doing everything possible to perform well while minimizing the risk of preventable injury?</p>
<p>The KDx solution will allow athletes to identify the right training regimens to maximize performance and minimize injury for their sport. It can be further tailored and customized using genomic profiling, blood test monitoring, and by connecting with leading experts in sports medicine, physical therapy, training, coaching, nutrition, sports psychology and genetics.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p>

However, the maximum time for BlueO3O3O3 placed in water is 40 minutes, and you need to remove BlueO3O3O3 from the water when it reaches 40 minutes.At room temperature, the ozone in water returns to oxygen after 10 minutes through reduction. Therefore, you can use ozone water to sterilize in these ten minutes.There are different ways to apply ozone water to targets. For oral cleaning, use BlueO3O3O3 to make ozone water and then use it as a regular mouthwash. For sterilizing small objects, put those objects directly into the water before and during the 4 min working duration of making ozone. When the 4 min finishes, the objects also complete their sterilization. For sterilizing larger areas, put the ozone water into a spray bottle, keep spraying the target until the water runs out (about 3-5 min).If BlueO3O3O3 leaves the water during a working duration, it automatically powers off within a few seconds. The same applies if you accidentally press the ""power button”, BlueO3O3O3 automatically detects its environment and powers off if not in water. BlueO3O3O3 is not a medical device.​It takes about 60 minutes for BlueO3O3O3 to be fully charged. Once fully charged, the battery can let BlueO3O3O3 work up to 50 minutes. Do not charge BlueO3O3O3 when it is working or in the water.It is recommended not to charge and discharge the battery multiple times a day to extend battery life. Therefore the recommended total working time for BlueO3O3O3 within 24 hours is 50 minutes. The ozone water that has just created (high concentration) is mainly used for sterilization and is not suitable for drinking. However, after ten minutes of reduction, ozone is converted to oxygen and becomes oxygen-rich water, which is very suitable for drinking. After ten minutes, the ozone concentration, if not none, is far below the standard that can cause harm to humans. So, you can confidently use our product to sterilize drinking water.Body temperature accelerates the conversion of ozone to oxygen, so when using ozone water as a mouthwash, there is no need to worry about ozone remaining in the mouth.The SGS reports show that at room temperature (25℃ or so), after contacting the ozone water made by BlueO3O3O3 for 4 minutes, the reduction rates of both Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus are over 99.9%. We are a design team called Friendly Life. ""Friendly Life"" is the name of our team and is also the ultimate philosophy we pursue. Our goal is to keep improving the user experience of living through creativity and design. We hope that there are always good products to accompany you, and you enjoy a relaxing and quality life.",31.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<h3>About Sebastián</h3>
<p>Hello! I am Sebastián Corbat, I am 37 years old and I am married to Angelica; we have two children, Florencia (5) and Vicente (2).</p>
<p>When I was 18 years old I was diagnosed with <a href=""http://www.xlpresearchtrust.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">XLP syndrome</a>, which means lymphoproliferative syndrome genetically transmitted by the X chromosome. Most of the people suffering from this syndrome do not survive the age of 10, being <strong><em>the bone marrow transplantation the only definite cure.</em></strong></p>
<p>In the particular case of my family, who is the only one known in Argentina with this syndrome, <em><strong>my parents had 8 children, 3 of them died when they were kids due to causes attributed to the XLP syndrome</strong></em>. Only in 1991, when my eldest brother Gustavo was very sick, we discovered that this disease existed within my family. Gustavo underwent transplantation using my sister’s bone marrow at <em>Hospital Británico de Buenos Aires</em> but he died some days after. Now there are only Mariana and Santiago healthy; Gabriel who is 50 years old with hypogammaglobulinemia (he is administered immunogammaglobulin every 4 weeks); and myself with 37 years old. I had been well until I had mononucleosis when I was 26 years old and I had to start with immunogammagloblulin infusions as Gabriel.</p>
<p>With this treatment I was able to live a normal life and without complications until the beginning of this year when due to a general weakness condition I was diagnosed with severe bone marrow aplasia. This means that my bone marrow is generating very few red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. This could become into a total aplasia, i.e.: my bone marrow will stop generating absolutely everything. Currently, I am under a supporting treatment (transfusions of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets), waiting for the bone marrow transplantation which will cure the bone marrow aplasia and the XLP syndrome.</p>
<p>As the time goes by, my body is asking for transfusions more often, and therefore, the transplantation should be performed as soon as possible to avoid this condition to become worse.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is not any successful experience of (i) transplantations in adults, (ii) with XLP, (iii) with aplastic anemia and (iv) of unrelated donors in South American institutions. We know that without carefully respecting these procedures, there is a small possibility of natural survival. According to the specialists contacted around the world by my family doctor, it is recommended to undergo the treatment in a place where there are doctors with vast experience in institutions specialized in allogenic stem cell transplantation of unrelated donors for aplastic anemia in adults.</p>
<p>The specialists contacted worldwide by my family doctor recommended Seba to undergo the treatment in institutions where there are doctors specialized in allogenic stem cell transplantations of unrelated donors for aplastic anemia in adults.</p>
<p>Nowadays, <strong>the only medical team</strong> who accepted to follow the case was Dr. Joseph Antin’s team from the <strong><em>Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), Boston,</em></strong> from more than a dozen of medical teams in USA and Europe who refused.

<p><em><strong>The treatment lasts 12 months and within such period of time I must remain in Boston.</strong></em></p>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p>After the success of our carbon noseclip earlier this year, we are now happy to introduce our <strong>new Octopus CNF lanyard (and belt)</strong>!</p>
<p>Resulting from several months of development, the final prototype was tested last September in the blue waters of Amorgos in Greece and gave full satisfaction!</p>
<p><strong>You can order either only the belt (including quick release) or the complete set</strong> with our lanyard including top grade 360° rotating carbon composite carabiner. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Less drag</h3>
<p>We drastically reduced the drag during freefall by using a thin but sturdy belt: polyester with aviation-style weaving, only 1mm thick but able to withstand more than 500kg loads, soft and pleasant to the touch. The carabiner cable being only 3mm in diameter, also contributes to significantly reducing drag.</p>

<h3>Waist positioning</h3>
<p>A simple but efficient fastening system between the legs, quick to clip on, ensures that the belt will not move up the waist during your freefall when your suit compresses. This « AUTOLOCK» system does not require applying excessive tension on the elastic band but keeps it softly and comfortably in place without friction between the legs.</p>

<p></p>
<p>David is a science junkie with a finance background who gets a kick out of raising funds for great charities which improve people’s lives through education and health. He has tried everything: silent auctions, <u><a href=""https://my.charitywater.org/p/profile?member_id=65954"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">wine tastings</a></u> and even <a href=""http://roomtoread.kintera.org/faf/donorReg/donorPledge.asp?ievent=1089974&amp;supid=406501823"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>triathlons</u></a>. He raised almost $30K for awesome organizations, but experienced how difficult it is to raise <b>more </b>money to help <b>more </b>people. He was inspired by the models of TOMS and Warby Parker - which use the power of the free market to invest in <i>doing good</i>.</p>
<p>His <u><a href=""http://www.getmarma.com/blog/?tag=grandmas"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">two grandmothers</a></u> were the reason he became interested in health remedies. They grew up 20 miles away from each other, but in very different settings: one in a large city, and the other in a rural setting. His mother was torn between listening to her mother-in-law's big-city doctor advice and following her own mother’s traditional child rearing advice. She ended up combining both approaches, which made him realize that health solutions that really work can be everywhere, what really matters is the underlying <u><a href=""http://www.getmarma.com/blog/?tag=proven+remedies"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>scientific proof</b></a></u>. <br/></p>

<p>We are launching Marma with the introduction of our first product: <b>Marma Gargle, for sore throat relief. </b>Based on the salt gargle remedy of our grandmothers, the ingredients in Marma Gargle are recognized by the FDA as anti-septic. This comes handy in many cases of sore throat that are due to increased bacterial growth. Many of us know the familiar feeling of waking up with a scratchy feeling, or a long flight (dry air affects our body's ability to fend off infections).</p>

We were tired of the insane costs of beauty products, but we recognize the importance of quality formulas and ingredients. We thought there had to be a better way. So, we decided to do things differently.  You will save hundreds to thousands of dollars a year on beauty products. With our model, we are cutting out 3-4 markups that typically occur with other beauty brands. By doing this, we are saving you loads of money that you can now spend on other things, like Netflix binging and Chunky Monkey ice cream! How you might ask? You buy products for the same price it costs us to make them. We will sell you all our beauty products at-cost. This means we will make ZERO profit on the products. We will simply make money through the small membership fees.USA Factory Partner. We partnered with a local U.S. manufacturer located in Utah to formulate and deliver the best products possible. These products would normally sell anywhere from $35 to $135 with other beauty brands.LIKE WHAT YOU SEE?!? Hit this button to help us!  Because you are taking a chance on us, we're offering you a deal of a lifetime, literally! This campaign will be the only time you'll be able to get a lifetime membership. Yes, you read that right.

Hit this button!  We will be launching with 11 products. Following our campaign, we will then release new products every month to few months, ensuring that members have a wide variety of product options to choose from. Aside from the savings we are passing onto you, we also wanted to ensure that each product we develop is top of the line and will be formulas that produce results. We will not compromise quality. Facial CleanserDay CreamNight CreamAnti-Aging CreamFacial TonerBody CreamBody ScrubWhitening ToothpastePlumping Lip GlossEyelash Growth SerumMascara In addition to high quality formulas and at-cost pricing, all our products will meet the following criteria: We want our brand and products to make a difference, but we also want them to be kind to the environment. We strive to use post-consumer resin and bioplastics in whatever packaging we can. This means they are much easier on the environment and 100% recyclable. We are always doing what we can to be more environmentally friendly.  By keeping things local and making our products here in the U.S, we're also keeping our carbon footprint down. LOVE OUR PRODUCT CRITERIA? Help make the world a better place by hitting this button! Why are we choosing a membership model instead of a traditional subscription model? Here's why: Because of the nature of the industry, the minimum order quantities for both packaging and products are high.

Which is why we are asking for your help! We need your help to jump-start DIME Beauty so we can make high-end beauty products affordable to all!  Baylee is a licensed master esthetician.

<h3></h3>
<p>At 21 years of age, a girl has several dreams. But for Sapna life is not the same any more. A brazen acid attack has not only left her defaced but has also shattered her completely. Sapna suffered the attack at the hands of her cousin’s brother-in-law on August 7, 2013. The biker flung the acid bottle at the girl and sped past.</p>
<p>Reason: he wanted to marry Sapna. When she rejected his proposal, he thrashed her and even tried to strip her of her dignity. But still she did not give in to his pressure and continued ignoring him. Before throwing this dangerous yellow chemical on her face, the attacker had warned her that he would not let her marry anyone else and teach her a lesson.</p>
<p>The attack took place in police presence and near the GTB Hospital, but no one – the two cops, stationed at a check post, passersby and the hospital staff – cared to help the 21-year-old, writhing in pain.</p>
<p>Sapna was returning from her workplace with one of her friends when the gruesome attack left her charred. She was left crying in pain on the road for good 45 minutes, while her friend ran to her house to call her parents. It was only after her parents reached the spot that a PCR call was made. Sapna was taken to the GTB Hospital only to bear more distress. She and her parents kept pleading the authorities to admit her and start the treatment, but no staff attended to her for about half-an-hour.</p>
<p>The fight did not stop for our fighter here. She has to undergo some surgeries. Her relatives have severed all ties from her family. Both Sapna and her father have lost their jobs. The family is reeling under acute financial crisis. According to the Supreme Court’s directive, the government gives a compensation of Rs 3 lakh. But it’s about two months Sapna is yet to receive this amount.</p>
<p>The attacker has been arrested but just for three months. Sapna puts a brave front and continues fighting for justice. And as it goes …tareekh pe tareekh, tareekh pe tareekh… let’s see when the braveheart gets the justice finally.</p>
<p>At this hour, all of us should come forward and do whatever little we can to help her meet her medical expenses.</p>

Who are we?
Engineering Without Borders Argentina (or Ingeniería Sin Fronteras Argentina) is a non-profit association conducting research, promoting and executing engineering surveys and projects which allow to improve people's life conditions throughout the Argentine nation.
We aim to build a fair, solidary and sustainable society through the elaboration of technological solutions in order to diminish poverty, preserve the environment and make society conscious of the necessity to advance towards a sustainable human development.
Our values are volunteer work, multidisciplinary approach, political and religious independence, sustainability and social equity.
 
What is the Colonia Dora problem?
Colonia Dora is in the North of Argentina, in the province of Santiago del Estero. In this town of 500 inhabitants there are bridges and routes which allow access to the rest of the region, but they are about to collapse or in very bad state because of summer floods, seasonal rains or the extreme droughts. This situation is extremely difficult for the Colonia Dora village: drinking water (brought by tank trucks), ambulances and school buses can't pass these bridges because of the high collapse risk.
There is an important need to provide water from outside: the local wells are contaminated by naturally produced arsenic, which makes the water in them highly toxic. The population depends on the bridges to receive the water, which comes from the water purifying plant of Añatuya 15 kms away, which comes in tank trucks which have to go a 30km additional distance to go to Colonia Dora without going on the damaged bridges. Every inhabitant of Colonia Dora gets 15 liters of water per day: considering the need to drink, cook, and wash themselves, this is clearly not enough. 
Besides the water problem, the bridge is essential for road traffic (road machinery, rural machinery, ambulances...). Trade being the main activity of the area, the rural production is harmed by the extra distance that all trucks have to do to go to Colonia Dora: the extra cost is money that people need, and won't get for their family and children. The bad state of the current bridges also makes walking dangerous: several children have had dire accidents, falling into the channel.
 
What is the ""A Bridge for Colonia Dora"" project?
Engineers Without Borders Argentina is working with the different municipal and provincial departments (municipality, provincial road engineering direction, water ministry) in order to provide a durable solution to these difficulties. Among other actions, we will build two bridges linking Colonia Dora to the rest of the region. The construction will begin in October 2013 and will last for more than six months.
EWB Argentina will obtain the necessary materials through this crowdfunding campaign; on the other hand, the necessary labour and machinery will be provided by the municipality and the province. 
Our aims are multiple:


Improving the quality and quantity of drinking water distributed to the population of the area, and educating people about the lack of drinkable water


Providing the school with the necessary water for its functioning


Motivate the population not to get beaten down by the harsh climate


Reducing the geographical isolation of Colonia Dora by improving its accessibility


Guaranteeing the safe circulation of road machinery, ambulances and other means of transports


Reducing the time and distance of the provision in order to promote local trade


More generally: improving the quality of life of 500 people. And you can do this, with just one little contribution !


 
What will be the end result of ""A Bridge for Colonia Dora""?
The two bridges that will be constructed thanks to this fundraising will be made of concrete. The first bridge, built over RAM Channel, will be 12m long and 6.4m wide, and the second one, built over IV Channel, will be 9m long and the same width. Both will have a span of 3m.
 
The project consists of two phases : 

Phase 1: Engineering and Fundraising


Making of calculations, necessary drawings as well as calculation of materials and costs.
Planification of the work.
Obtention of the financing for the materials.
Coordination with the Municipality and different organisms for the works.


Phase 2: Execution of the work


Bypass of the channel.
Earth movement.
Making the concrete of the floor slab and aproximation structure.
Making the concrete of pillars.
Making the concrete slab and the bridge deck.
Inauguration of the bridge and closing of the bypass.

Due to the local climate characteristics, these two stages may not be consecutive.

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 class=""p1"">Situation:</h3>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<p class=""p1"">Every 3 minutes a child is born with a cleft. For these children access to surgical care is necessary to fix the birth deformity. Thanks to the help of ReSurge International, many of them receive the surgical care they need, effectively improving appearance and reducing stigma, leading to a more promising tomorrow. However, such surgeries are often not performed in infancy. That means an older child will need to relearn how to speak as he or she adjusts to the new architecture of his or her mouth. </p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<h3 class=""p1"">Solution: </h3>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<p class=""p1"">To address the need, ReSurge International and it's partner in Nepal, Dr. Shankar Rai, have created week-long “Speech and Dental Camps” each month. These Speech and Dental Camps provide access to comprehensive cleft treatments to help our patients overcome related health conditions such as articulation disorder, hypernasal speech, speech and language delay, as well as a variety of dental problems. </p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<h3 class=""p1"">Your Contribution Will:</h3>
<p class=""p3""> </p>
<p class=""p4"">Provide 30-40 child and their families access to a week-long speech and dental camp where they will receive pre- and post-operative services in: </p>
<ul class=""ul1"">
<li>speech therapies</li>
<li>pediatric dental services</li>
<li>nutrition education</li>
<li>orthodontic care. </li>
</ul><p class=""p3""> </p>
<p class=""p4"">ReSurge’s Speech and Dental Camp Medical Teams consist of 1-2 plastic surgeons, 1 dental surgeon, 1 speech therapist, 4 speech therapy assistants, 1-2 orthodontists and dental assistants. </p>
<p class=""p3""> </p>
<p class=""p4"">Thousands of children have benefited from the program—and many have already “graduated” with successfully integrated speech patterns. With your investment today, you can help many more children benefit from these successful speech and dental camps.</p>
<p>Join ReSurge International and California State University Northridge's National Student Speech, Language and Hearing Association (CSUN-NSSLHA) to raise funds for one speech camp. </p>

Situation:
 
Every 3 minutes a child is born with a cleft. For these children access to surgical care is necessary to fix the birth deformity. Thanks to the help of ReSurge International, many of them receive the surgical care they need, effectively improving appearance and reducing stigma, leading to a more promising tomorrow. However, such surgeries are often not performed in infancy. That means an older child will need to relearn how to speak as he or she adjusts to the new architecture of his or her mouth. 
 
Solution: 
 
To address the need, ReSurge International and it's partner in Nepal, Dr. Shankar Rai, have created week-long “Speech and Dental Camps” each month. These Speech and Dental Camps provide access to comprehensive cleft treatments to help our patients overcome related health conditions such as articulation disorder, hypernasal speech, speech and language delay, as well as a variety of dental problems. 
 
Your Contribution Will:
 
Provide 30-40 child and their families access to a week-long speech and dental camp where they will receive pre- and post-operative services in: 

speech therapies
pediatric dental services
nutrition education
orthodontic care. 
 
ReSurge’s Speech and Dental Camp Medical Teams consist of 1-2 plastic surgeons, 1 dental surgeon, 1 speech therapist, 4 speech therapy assistants, 1-2 orthodontists and dental assistants. 
 
Thousands of children have benefited from the program—and many have already “graduated” with successfully integrated speech patterns. With your investment today, you can help many more children benefit from these successful speech and dental camps.
Join ReSurge International and California State University Northridge's National Student Speech, Language and Hearing Association (CSUN-NSSLHA) to raise funds for one speech camp.
