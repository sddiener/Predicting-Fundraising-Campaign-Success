<h3>Purpose, Cause, Background</h3>
<p>Hello investors, let me start by introducing myself. My name is Brian and I am an avid photographer trying to make my impact on the world. I have been taking photos my entire life and it has always been a strong passion of mine. While attending photography classes at Santa Monica College I realized my potential to be a great photographer. I switched from film to photo-journalism and I have been on my path to professional photography ever since. </p>
<p><em>I am a true artist at heart. I also draw, tattoo, play 8 instruments, and I am an avid researcher of history and science. I love learning new things, every day I learn something new.</em></p>
<p><strong>Over the last several years I have found myself in the corporate world of photography and graphics. I have done everything from weddings, to family portraits, to catalogs and print advertisement. In January 2013 I decided to resign from my management position at my full-time job to pursue photography. It was a blessing but a struggle at the same time. </strong></p>
<p><b>Currently I am working as a freelance photographer trying to make a dent on the photography market in my area. I am also in the progress of writing a photography book that should be finished by the end of 2013. I want to share my images with the world and share my knowledge with other photographers. Photography and visual media is a big part of our everyday lives; I want to be a part of that and make a difference. Photo-journalism is very important to me.  </b></p>
<p><strong>Please help fund me to a National Geographic workshop so I can keep learning and spreading the joy and happiness of photography. <em>I will use this workshop to sharpen my skills and to produce content for my book and portfolio.</em> Understand this is what I want to do for the rest of my life. Taking pictures and capturing one of a kind moments is what I live and breathe for. </strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>What We Need!</h3>
<p>There are several National Geographic workshops that will be held within the next 2-3 months. My goal is to attend one of these workshops to learn from a real National Geographic photographer. While doing so I plan and obtaining more content for my book and website. I need to have an edge in the photography market and the knowledge and content I would receive from the workshop will be greatly beneficial for me.</p>
<p>FYI. I have the gear and equipment to accomplish all my tasks. I have the knowledge and drive to get what I want done. I just need the funds at this point.</p>
<p>The workshops include accommodations and classes with a professional National Geographic photographer. They will take the students to various locations and teach us on site in the field. </p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The cheapest workshop is also the closest to me. The workshop will start on Oct. 3rd 2013 and will be in San Francisco, California. The workshop total cost will be $2,020. I will also need to drive (several hours) or fly to San Francisco as airfare and transport is not included in the price of the workshop. I will also have to pay for my own food. $3,000 would allow me to take this workshop.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><span>Another potential workshop is in Washington D.C. I have never been there and I would love to attend this workshop in our nations Capital. The date for this workshop is Oct. 24th 2013 and costs $1,875. I would have to fly or drive which will cost at least a few hundred dollars. I am not opposed to driving because I will be able to take photos across the United States while driving to Washington D.C. An estimated $3,000-$4,000 would be needed to fund me to this workshop.</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><span><span>The Yellowstone winter workshop sounds like a great chance to be in the snow and take photos. I like the challenge and would help give me experience in outdoor snow photography. Photography in the snow is something that takes a lot of skill and knowledge to perfect. This workshop starts on Dec. 22nd 2013 and I would miss Christmas with the family but it would be well worth the experience. The cost of this workshop is $3,495 and I would drive to Yellowstone to take advantage of the scenic wilderness. With transportation and food $4,000-$5,000 total would help make this workshop a reality.</span></span></span></p>
<p>There are also international destinations for National Geographic workshops. The Galapagos Islands have long since been known for its ecosystem and beauty. This trip is between $4,990-$8,660. This does not include airfare to Miami where they will depart to the Galapagos, another $1,000 in airfare to South America. It is a ten day workshop on the islands and $7,000 minimum would help fund me to this workshop. </p>
<p>For something a bit further, on November 12th 2013 there is a New Zealand workshop. Total cost for the workshop is $6,895. Not including airfare and food. I would need at least $8,000 for this trip. If this campaign exceeds 100% I will go for this workshop. </p>
<h3>What You Get!</h3>
<p>This is the most important part. What you will get for your contribution. </p>
<p>I will be offering limited edition signed prints in various sizes. All prints will be done by a local professional printer. All prints will retain its beauty for years to come. Even if I don't reach my goal I will send you a beautiful print for your support. I will include a personal letter with each print. Photo choices from gallery will include past photos and photos from the workshop. I will provide a link to the gallery. </p>
<p>For the high rollers I will be offering hand sculpted flowers in three sizes. All sculptures are original pieces of art by a local painter and sculptor. I am always for supporting local artists and if I can share their gift and mine, why not?!  </p>
<p>If you want I can sweeten the deal by giving you a photoshoot. Whether you need head-shots, or if you have a business and you need professional product photos. I will include a certain amount of photos I will give you, fully edited, ready for print. Products can be brought to me or mailed. </p>
<p><strong>GALLERY WILL BE AVAILABLE AFTER THE WORKSHOP! PLEASE STAY TUNED.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Like I said before, even if I don't reach my goal I want everyone to receive something in memory of their charity. I created many options for myself if I don't reach my goal. The San Fran workshop would be possible even if I only reach half of my goal. If I do not raise enough for any of the workshops I will use the money towards a local photography program that costs under several hundred dollars. Remaining money will be used towards my ""travel California photographic journey"" collection. I am born and raised in California and in my opinion is a beautiful state with a lot to offer. Either way the funds to help push my photography career. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The main thing is to build my content for my book and website. A photography book on techniques and tips etc. This book will be finished by the end of the year. </strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>The Deep Impact</h3>
<p><b>I love photo-journalism and it is what I want to do for the rest of my life. Whether its portraying art, nature, society etc. I want to be able to tell a story with that photograph. I want you to be part of it and know that when you see that photograph you had a part in it. Know that when I am taking each photo I will be thinking of every one of you who helped me get my first push onto this journey. This is only the first step to something can be extraordinary. Help me be that individual who gets the point across and the job done correctly. My mind is constantly thinking of photography and how I can be the best photographer possible. I am very good at what I do and with the knowledge I have gained over the years and your support we cannot fail. </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>

<em>print oculus</em>:<em> mobile device photography</em>
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><em>sample pages under 'Gallery'<br/></em></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In these days of countless photographs being taken and shared with ease and for such a wide and varied audience <em>Oculus Arts would like to discover the photographic artist in us all.</em></p>
<p>This past winter Oculus Arts put out a call for submissions to all mobile device photographers to join in our first publication –</p>
<p><em><strong>print oculus: mobile device photography</strong> </em></p>
<p>Casting the news as wide as we could we invited everyone with a mobile device to offer one of their photography files to be put into print. To accompany their images we asked for peoples’ consideration about the topic Enlightenment: Past, Present or Future.</p>
<p>Oculus Arts stopped accepting submissions late March and with the photographs from folks from different places and of varying ages we have created a 60 page photography book of mobile device photography.</p>
<p>An element of this book is the juried exhibition of twelve outstanding images submitted. These photographs, chosen by two professional photographic artists will become Giclee prints and be on show at QSQ Gallery, Toronto (845 College Street) throughout May 2013, in concurrence with the Photography Festival CONTACT. Also within this book there is an essay that offers thoughtful debate about mobile phone image capture.</p>
<p>A comment on photography in our times <em><strong>print oculus: mobile device photography</strong></em> is about to go into print. The number of copies in the first edition will be determined by the amount of funds we can raise. This is where crowd sourcing with indiegogo can help. With your contribution we can print books, reach more people and bring awareness to Oculus Arts as a link to discover stunning and clever artwork and with this first publication suggest making prints of your photographs that so often remain as pixels.</p>
<h3><em>your contribution:</em></h3>
<p>A person making a minimum contribution of $250 CAD will receive a copy of the book signed and dated by the Oculus team and a fine art print of their choice from the 12 images in the exhibition.</p>
<p>Interest in distribution for the book has already been expressed from boutiques and galleries in Halifax and Toronto, Canada and London and Glasgow, UK.</p>
<p>In recent experience we have discovered the use of mobile device photography in fields of expertise previously unchartered by such a tool for image capture. For example –press photographer Lewis Whyld in his latest exhibition ‘London Riots Revisited’ at the Strand Gallery, London (February 2013) comments, “The scenes of looting, chaos and violence were shocking and had to be recorded, even if it meant I shot many of my pictures from a mobile phone using the beam of police helicopter searchlights.”</p>
<p>This year among the chosen submissions to the Taylor Wessing Photographic Portrait Prize at the National Portrait Gallery of London an IPhone captured photograph was commended and part of the exhibition.</p>
<p>Such acknowledgement lends proof to the timely and exciting journey we are embarking on as we take our place within current discussion in the history of photography.</p>
<p>This being Oculus Arts’ first publication we are at the starting block to developing a successful track record. Nevertheless, it is important to note that within this, our first year of existence, Oculus Arts has exhibited three photographic artists in Toronto and have had sales from every show.</p>
<p>Oculus Arts was created by Becky Parsons in March 2012. We are a growing team, now of four, applying our skills and experience to the representation and promotion in Canada of the photographic arts.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Oculus Arts team:</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Becky Parsons</em> –a photographic artist and cinematographer based in Toronto, born and studied in London, England. Now after 15 years experience within the photographic arts is building Oculus Arts, an art enabler for artist representation and sales.

sample pages under 'Gallery'


In these days of countless photographs being taken and shared with ease and for such a wide and varied audience Oculus Arts would like to discover the photographic artist in us all.
This past winter Oculus Arts put out a call for submissions to all mobile device photographers to join in our first publication –
print oculus: mobile device photography 
Casting the news as wide as we could we invited everyone with a mobile device to offer one of their photography files to be put into print. To accompany their images we asked for peoples’ consideration about the topic Enlightenment: Past, Present or Future.
Oculus Arts stopped accepting submissions late March and with the photographs from folks from different places and of varying ages we have created a 60 page photography book of mobile device photography.
An element of this book is the juried exhibition of twelve outstanding images submitted. These photographs, chosen by two professional photographic artists will become Giclee prints and be on show at QSQ Gallery, Toronto (845 College Street) throughout May 2013, in concurrence with the Photography Festival CONTACT. Also within this book there is an essay that offers thoughtful debate about mobile phone image capture.
A comment on photography in our times print oculus: mobile device photography is about to go into print. The number of copies in the first edition will be determined by the amount of funds we can raise. This is where crowd sourcing with indiegogo can help. With your contribution we can print books, reach more people and bring awareness to Oculus Arts as a link to discover stunning and clever artwork and with this first publication suggest making prints of your photographs that so often remain as pixels.
your contribution:
A person making a minimum contribution of $250 CAD will receive a copy of the book signed and dated by the Oculus team and a fine art print of their choice from the 12 images in the exhibition.
Interest in distribution for the book has already been expressed from boutiques and galleries in Halifax and Toronto, Canada and London and Glasgow, UK.
In recent experience we have discovered the use of mobile device photography in fields of expertise previously unchartered by such a tool for image capture. For example –press photographer Lewis Whyld in his latest exhibition ‘London Riots Revisited’ at the Strand Gallery, London (February 2013) comments, “The scenes of looting, chaos and violence were shocking and had to be recorded, even if it meant I shot many of my pictures from a mobile phone using the beam of police helicopter searchlights.”
This year among the chosen submissions to the Taylor Wessing Photographic Portrait Prize at the National Portrait Gallery of London an IPhone captured photograph was commended and part of the exhibition.
Such acknowledgement lends proof to the timely and exciting journey we are embarking on as we take our place within current discussion in the history of photography.
This being Oculus Arts’ first publication we are at the starting block to developing a successful track record. Nevertheless, it is important to note that within this, our first year of existence, Oculus Arts has exhibited three photographic artists in Toronto and have had sales from every show.
Oculus Arts was created by Becky Parsons in March 2012. We are a growing team, now of four, applying our skills and experience to the representation and promotion in Canada of the photographic arts.
The Oculus Arts team:
Becky Parsons –a photographic artist and cinematographer based in Toronto, born and studied in London, England. Now after 15 years experience within the photographic arts is building Oculus Arts, an art enabler for artist representation and sales. There is a portfolio of her work on the Oculus website: http://www.oculusarts.com/bio_becky.html and a sampling of her cinematography on her personal website: http://beckyparsons.com/reel1/index.html. Currently she is making a documentary film about the late photographer Margaret Watkins.

</ul></div>","THE PROJECT:I began this project in 2007 while shooting live music commissions for different publications. I have attended and have documented around 3000 concerts ranging from hip hop and electronica to heavy metal, punk rock, pop and everything in between. The project grew organically as a natural offshoot to event photography and I ultimately became fascinated by the sea of die hard fans packed tightly against each other in the front row like sardines. Given my proximity to the bands and performers, I naturally turned my camera on their fans' ball of energy and the youth culture music experience that revolves around concerts. AnthraxWE WERE THERE is a hardcover book dedicated to concert fandom, shot over a decade in Austin, Texas  2007-2017.  This project explores the symbiotic relationship between rock concert fans, the bands, and myself, the photographer at music festivals. It is also a self-portrait of a music fan, musician, and photographer, who has been on both sides of the stage, barrier, and photo pit. Without the band there are no fans; without the fans, there is no band. One just cannot exist without the other!I've done my fair share of cramming down the front, playing onstage and now, after 10 years I'm ready to make a book for the fans.FUN“Sandy Carson's We Were There book is a unique and wonderful take on the live concert experience. These photographs of people watching musicians perform, tell their own story in a way that a collection of images of bands never could.”- Stuart Braithwaite, MOGWAI.Touche AmoreI have exhibited WE WERE THERE several times over the last couple of years, including at Houston Center for Photography, Austin City Hall and at Lawndale Arts Center  during FOTOFEST 2016, which sparked interest with the prestigious art publisher, Daylight Books to publish the project as a book.  It has always been my dream to put this out as a coffee table hardback and  I thought, why not include a 7-inch record with band's who's fans are also featured within the pages of the book? Your kind donations towards WE WERE THERE will directly involve you in the production of the hardbound book and vinyl record, making you a part of the Austin music history, keeping physical media alive.Odd FutureTHE BOOK:Physical media has a very special place in my heart as well as my book shelf and record collection. Print and vinyl serve as a totally different live experience to the digital platform. WE WERE THERE offers a look into the atmosphere and confined spaces that fans occupy at concerts, crammed down the front row, you can almost smell the sweat and I'm glad this is not a scratch and sniff book!With your generous help, a hardback edition of WE WERE THERE will be published by the well respected Daylight Books in the fall of 2017, with a target print run of 1000 books and vinyl, 250 of which will be signed and exclusive only to Indiegogo back​ers.​An artist dummy of the monograph and vinyl.  I am working closely with the Daylight team to ensure this comes as close to the concert experience as it can within the pages of a book. We are also working on a photo pass wristband that will wrap around the book Projected book specs:
96 pages
50 color photographs
160gsm MAGNO MATT paper or similar
7-inch flexi disk insert
Photo pit wristband book wrap
Ephemera

THE VINYL:I am also, with the help of this campaign, pressing a limited-edition collectors 7-inch flexi disk record featuring unreleased tracks by two of my favorite Austin bands, The Black Angels and The Sword. I'm really excited to have both these bands getting behind this project, and having them on the same record is the icing on the cake, erm... book.  It's gonna be a really unique split collaboration record of heavy metal/ punk and psychedelia. The records are manufactured in the Czech Republic at the last place left in the world to make these. So get yourself one of these analogue beauties before they are gone forever!The vinyl and signed book will be available to backers at the $75 reward level and above, with a mention in the acknowledgements and a solid high five or a Glasgow Kiss next time I see you.

<h3>About me and the Project</h3>
<p>My name is Michael Boyd and i've been practicing photography for about two years, and in that span i've been able to cover a lot of ground. I've shot product campaigns, had work on billboards, worked with agencies, actors, designers, and published a few times by magazines. During this time i've developed skills and now I want to show people what I've been working on. So much so I took the opportunity to showcase the more artistic side of my work and a new direction I want to go with photography.</p>
<p>The project, that is untitled at the moment, will have elements in surrealism, scanography as well as parallels to classical artists with a contemporary styling and intricate set design. Consisting of six 4ftx2ft glass panels suspended from the ceiling, the panels will be arranged around the guest to encompasses and provide a unique experience to every person viewing. </p>
<p>On the panels there will be two 1ftx1ft Silver Aluminum Finish prints of my work, the prints, as stated before, will have elements of surrealism and scanography. Something to blur the lines between photography and visual (fine) art.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What is needed?</h3>
<p>Additional funds to off-set the overhead costs of the materials needed to build the actual instillation and printing. The Actual amount needed is around $510 but the extra $40 will be allocated for miscellanous costs. </p>
<p>It breaks down like this:</p>
<p>the 4x2 glass panels are 50$ a piece, multiply that by 6 and that brings the total up to 300</p>
<p>the high strength invisible hanging line costs 5$ for an 8pack, that brings up up to 305</p>
<p>the Silver Aluminum Finish prints are 12.00 a piece multiply that by 17 and we're at 509.</p>
<p>the remaining 41 dollars will be for miscellaneous needs, like ties, adhesives, bits etc. </p>
<p>Even if the goal isn't met, the money donated will go to the project to make do with what was raised. </p>
<p>To the 5 top contributors, a large format Silver Aluminum Finish print will be fed ex'd to them for them to hang or mount in home. </p>
<p>After the festival is concluded the entire instillation will be donated to an art foundation or schools art program, that will be disclosed soon.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read over the project. </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>A few years ago I produced a documentary about a forgotten community in Bangladesh. This is the so-called ""bihari"" or urdu-speaking community. After the devastating war in 1971, the urdu-speaking community of the newly created Bangladesh came to be seen as collaborators in the war. They were rounded up and put in internment camps for their own safety. Years went by and this community languished in over-crowded and unsanitary camps. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The documentary received the 2nd prize at the Kathmandu Film Festival, out of 39 film documentaries from south asia, and managed to raise a lot of awareness about the issue. It has played in festivals throughout the world. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We then decided to put together an exhibition of photographs taken by camp children (passionately organised by Hannah Sholder) and outsiders on the meaning of citizenship for this desperate community. The result was the successful 2010 Ummid competition and exhibition held at the Alliance Francaise de Dhaka, Bangladesh. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>My next goal is to produce a book of a selection of the 500 photographs we received. Some are by children from the camps who were given disposable cameras and some by community people and professional photographers. These photos show that despite the horrendous conditions, life goes on and there is resilience and humour and love. <br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Biharis are marginalised people. They have never been included to join mainstream life. To be part of a project where their lives are depicted through photographs and text and which is then published would be a cultural milestone for this community and for Bangladesh, as it takes tentative steps to becoming an inclusive country. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We will be printing in Bangladesh where high quality printing is affordable. For a run of 1500 books we need £3500. We need a further £1000 for the design/layout/proofreading/colour conversion ( a sum we have raised through supporters and friends). The format will be interestingly large! Full colour on art paper.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>You get a mention in the book for only $20! You get a mention and a free book for $35!! And if you contribute $100 or $200 - you get a bundle that will leave you speechless! Check the right hand side for the lowdown. <br/></p>

<h3>Geek Pride Cosplay Calendar 2014</h3>
<a href=""http://www.geek-pride.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.geek-pride.co.uk</a><br/><a href=""http://www.cancerresearchuk.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.cancerresearchuk.org</a><br/><br/>We at Geek Pride are passionate about small business ventures and love to support the little people, so we decided to set out on a small venture of our own. This September we are embarking on a mission to bring you a truly unique cosplay calendar, created by and featuring the Geek Pride writers and contributors, alongside guest artists who will be donating their artwork to the calendar.<br/><br/>We are selling these calendars to raise funds for Cancer Research UK. The reason we chose to donate all proceeds instead of keeping them to ourselves is because cancer has affected almost every single one of us, whether that be family or friends that have suffered, or even ourselves. We feel that this is a worthy cause and would love to make as many pennies for them as humanly possible.<br/><br/><h3>A calendar you say?<br/>
</h3>
<p>Yes indeed! A cosplay calendar to be precise. This means that our writers and contributers will be cosplaying (a fancy way of saying ""dressing up"") as beloved comic book, film and gaming characters. I don't want to give away too much too soon - *spoilers* - but you can expect to see Wonder Woman in a prom dress, what more could you want?<br/><br/>We will release teaser pictures as the month goes by to give you a flavour of where we are going with the calendar and on the day of the photoshoot we will be filming for a behind the scenes DVD and podcast which we will release as a perk.</p>
<p>We have some awesome cosplayers on board, some of which can be seen below:</p>
<p>(Please note these are NOT the final images, the photoshoot is on the 22nd September) </p>

<p>We also have other perks too! We have gone all out in getting some amazing artists to do some artwork for the calendar which will be available as prints. They're working hard to produce unique and original artwork to fit with each month of the calendar!

www.geek-pride.co.ukwww.cancerresearchuk.orgWe at Geek Pride are passionate about small business ventures and love to support the little people, so we decided to set out on a small venture of our own. This September we are embarking on a mission to bring you a truly unique cosplay calendar, created by and featuring the Geek Pride writers and contributors, alongside guest artists who will be donating their artwork to the calendar.We are selling these calendars to raise funds for Cancer Research UK. The reason we chose to donate all proceeds instead of keeping them to ourselves is because cancer has affected almost every single one of us, whether that be family or friends that have suffered, or even ourselves. We feel that this is a worthy cause and would love to make as many pennies for them as humanly possible.A calendar you say?

Yes indeed! A cosplay calendar to be precise. This means that our writers and contributers will be cosplaying (a fancy way of saying ""dressing up"") as beloved comic book, film and gaming characters. I don't want to give away too much too soon - *spoilers* - but you can expect to see Wonder Woman in a prom dress, what more could you want?We will release teaser pictures as the month goes by to give you a flavour of where we are going with the calendar and on the day of the photoshoot we will be filming for a behind the scenes DVD and podcast which we will release as a perk.
We have some awesome cosplayers on board, some of which can be seen below:
(Please note these are NOT the final images, the photoshoot is on the 22nd September) 

 



We also have other perks too! We have gone all out in getting some amazing artists to do some artwork for the calendar which will be available as prints. They're working hard to produce unique and original artwork to fit with each month of the calendar! Check out the updates and our facebook page for more information on them but here's a small example of some of their varied work! (More info soon to come!)

Tshirts as a perk? Show me, show me!



So where do I come in?

As it stands we have covered all the costs of the costumes, the studio 
(with a little help from NQ Photography in Manchester), the props and scenery, the design costs and all the other little costs that keep cropping up in association with the creation of our masterpiece, but when it comes to printing costs we are a little stumped for cash.
We tried to raise sponsorship from companies to get the money together, but were faced with nothing but rejection letters left right and centre - it seemed all hope was lost until someone suggested Indiegogo.
Your donation will cover the costs of the printing, and ALL profit will be sent to Cancer Research UK.
Working off the basis that we hit our £1000 target, we have been able to keep the calendar printing costs down thanks to the wonderful people at Bamford Print, which means that if we hit our target we can raise around £750.00 for Cancer Research UK!


What difference will it make?

Please excuse me for taking this directly from the Cancer Research UK website but I think you'll find they can say it better than I ever could:

What happens if you don't raise £1000?

<p><b></b></p><h3><b><b>Artist's Statement</b></b></h3><p></p>
<p>Nothing screams “ I’m rich"" more than
top-of-the-line designer fashion. I mean really; you did spend  good money on
this artisanal clothing, so you shouldn't care what you look like. This forward-thinking along with the collaborative efforts of lead Parisian designers lead to the creation of one of the most cutting edge, avant garde fashion lines

</h3>I'm Walter Elliott, and I want to share something special with you.  I'm a photographer with a passion for nature and I sell my work through my small business, <i>Images by Walter E.

</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I'm raising $4,500 to purchase a new computer for editing, a new lens for my camera, and to fund travel expenses for a week.  A lofty goal but the best part of contributing - what you get in return!  At every level you receive a signed print of your choice.  The bigger the contribution, the bigger the print.  The higher levels offer t-shirts, sweatshirts, and digital rights to the images.  For $500 you get a signed 24x36 print, a t-shirt, a sweatshirt, and the use of a guaranteed minimum of 50 images!  Here are a few more examples of my work: </p>

<p>We are very familiar with the emotive power of cinema. As a still photographer and sound designer, I've been exploring cinematic alternatives that are equally capable of providing sensory enrichment. <i>Eksod</i> is the culmination of that exploration. </p>
<p>A walk thru this architectural exhibit is a walk thru an immersive story which changes depending on the path and pace chosen by the viewer. While television and film sound design requires sound programs that are locked in a linear synchronous format, <i>Eksod</i> will tear apart the assumptions of where, when, and how we receive the auditory sensation of the story. Each region of the gallery represents a scene - each zone in the room will pair photographs with the sounds of the Albanian conflict and landscape. Part fiction, part non-fiction, the exhibit will employ a mix of art directed images and sounds, along with street photography and  authentic interviews from the streets of Albania. </p></span>

<h3>The Story</h3></span></div>
<p>Fraught with a long history of political and social upheaval, poverty, and rampant corruption - Albania is home to Europe's highest emigration rate. <i>Eksod</i> (Albanian for exodus) tells a story of a movement of people that seek an escape from their unfulfilled lives. <i>Eksod</i> delivers this story through an experiential exhibit using live performance, sound design, and photography to depict an Albanian's struggle to emigrate to a different country at any cost. </p>

<h3>Impact of your Donation</h3>
<p>Installment of <i>Eksod</i> represents more than a completed artwork. I left behind my commercial sound recording business in the states that had been my means of meeting my cost of living.  <i>Eksod</i> is a gateway from the technical to the creative stage of my career. It's my aim to create exhibits like <i>Eksod</i> on behalf of organizations, other collaborating artists, and small businesses that value and need to express in sensory immersive ways. By supporting this project, you are giving me the traction I need to transform a career, you are bringing attention to a struggle facing a beautiful Balkan region, and you are acquiring artwork for your personal collection.</p>

Eksod is a visual and sound art  installation. It will tell a story with printed photographs and sounds recorded on location. The script and characters have been based on interviews and research in Albania. This campaign is an ask for support to capture Eksod - scheduled to begin production in March '16.







The Artform


We are very familiar with the emotive power of cinema. As a still photographer and sound designer, I've been exploring cinematic alternatives that are equally capable of providing sensory enrichment. Eksod is the culmination of that exploration. 
A walk thru this architectural exhibit is a walk thru an immersive story which changes depending on the path and pace chosen by the viewer. While television and film sound design requires sound programs that are locked in a linear synchronous format, Eksod will tear apart the assumptions of where, when, and how we receive the auditory sensation of the story. Each region of the gallery represents a scene - each zone in the room will pair photographs with the sounds of the Albanian conflict and landscape. Part fiction, part non-fiction, the exhibit will employ a mix of art directed images and sounds, along with street photography and  authentic interviews from the streets of Albania. 



The Story
Fraught with a long history of political and social upheaval, poverty, and rampant corruption - Albania is home to Europe's highest emigration rate. Eksod (Albanian for exodus) tells a story of a movement of people that seek an escape from their unfulfilled lives. Eksod delivers this story through an experiential exhibit using live performance, sound design, and photography to depict an Albanian's struggle to emigrate to a different country at any cost. 






The Significance
Eksod is a reduction of architectural acoustics, filmmaking, sound design, and photography. I have emphasized combining these fields because they are my historical foci, and because innovation has a track record of occurring when cross-disciplinary fields merge.


Justin installing ""Peacock Farm"" in Brooklyn, NY 2015
To date, I've installed in cafes and art expositions. Eksod will be the first presentation of a narrative story in a purposefully designed acoustical environment as it was originally perceived to be executed. 
I moved from the United States to Albania in an attempt to realize this dream and began pre-production in January of 2016. I need your help. 


 


What's Needed & What You Get
This Indiegogo campaign is required to fund the production costs associated with capturing the mixed media story in Tirana, Albania. No funds are being asked for gear. This campaign is not allocated for the printing and physical construction costs of the exhibit. Grants and sponsorship have been earmarked for the post-production stage and are outside the scope of this campaign.
The production costs that your contributions will fund are as follows:  Rental car costs on 6 shooting days - $350
Food for the supporting cast and crew on 6 shoot days - $600
Cost for access/permission to shoot at locations (A Butcher Shop and an Albanian Home) -$200
Additional baggage cost to transport camera, lighting, and sound gear round trip from NYC to Albania - $350
Production Office for 3 months - $900
Production and fullfillment costs of perks - $450
Wardrobe designer on 3 shoot days - $450 
As a thank you, artwork will be provided to contributing supporters - details provided in the ""Perks"" section.



 



Impact of your Donation
Installment of Eksod represents more than a completed artwork. I left behind my commercial sound recording business in the states that had been my means of meeting my cost of living.  Eksod is a gateway from the technical to the creative stage of my career. It's my aim to create exhibits like Eksod on behalf of organizations, other collaborating artists, and small businesses that value and need to express in sensory immersive ways. By supporting this project, you are giving me the traction I need to transform a career, you are bringing attention to a struggle facing a beautiful Balkan region, and you are acquiring artwork for your personal collection.

<h4><u>the project: personal connections and broad significance</u></h4>
<p>I'm an artist and lifelong resident of the American south. Growing up in the pine belt of southern Mississippi, longleaf pine were dominant across the land leaving deep imprints on my identity. More recently, the view camera provided a way to reconnect, to attempt having regular and authentic connections to what little remains of this incredible landscape.  As I dug into the natural, cultural and economic histories of the this tree and its fire dependent ecosystem, it became a search to see what was still there and what it looks like today. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502287762/vpa7pdohsitduizuh6po.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Prior to the onset of European settlement in America, the longleaf pine was the keystone species in a landscape mosaic that covered some 90 million acres of southern Coastal Plain from Virginia to east Texas. In the late 19th and early 20th century original longleaf pinelands were all but wiped away by human action at an industrial scale.<br/>This body of images,<i>The Pines</i>, explores remnants of old-growth longleaf pinelands across the southeast United States. Historically, this was once one of America's most significant landscapes.</p>

<p>These images are my experience in the present that give a tiny glimpse of insight into both past and future. More than only a concern for creating visual records or an archive of yet another shortsighted American decline scenario, I am interested in the complexity of human presence, natural beauty, and environmental change in this decidedly southern, contemporary post-wilderness landscape. These images are a meditation on this landscape’s significant past and present and consider how loss and beauty can coexist to motivate a better future.</p>

<p>It is my hope that with your generous support, this book will help the images and what they represent find a larger and wider audience. Pine trees are quite common across the south and beyond. While based in the region, this incredible landscape's story should be better known, so I hope the work can find an expanded audience both within and beyond the region. </p>

In fact, he was the first to design and produce remarkable anastigmatic lenses – lenses that correct for spherical aberration – actually some time before other famous manufacturers such as Zeiss with whom he worked closely. In 1865, some 25 years before Dr. Paul Rudolph introduced his Protar lens to Zeiss, Busch patented the Pantoskop lens, the world’s first true anastigmatic lens. © Mirène Schmitz Prototype of our new Glaukar F3.1 (97mm) It was an excellent wide angle lens and his experience with this anastigmatic lens construction inspired the later development of the famous Glaukar.In 1910, Emil Busch introduced the Glaukar, a fully corrected photographic lens, which besides solving spherical aberration, corrected coma and astigmatism was a ""usable"" lens. Unlike Rudolph’s Protar, which did not work properly at the time of invention because its construction required glass coatings not available at the time, the Emil Busch Glaukar lens was the first anastigmatic lens for daily portrait photography.By creating his anastigmatic lenses, Busch corrected the above mentioned faults by careful combination of the lens elements. Sharpness and artistic images were possible for the first time.In its time, the remarkable and usable anastigmatic lens Emil Busch’s F 3.1 Glaukar Anastigmat, was considered a very “fast” lens, meaning it worked well in available, low-light light.   The Glaukar created a very special portrait-effect. The Glaukar was a lens that was specifically used for portrait-photography since it was fast enough to come to a more natural design of the image. It was characterized by the homogenous transfer from sharpness to the more fuzzy areas. Very important: the chromatical aberration was extremely low for the time. To bring back the legendary Glaukar lens it is necessary to fully reinvent the Glaukar from scratch for modern photographers and their state of the art equipment.Prototype of our new Glaukar 3.1 (97mm) And now:Also available in Modern Black or Profi WhiteOur Emil Busch Glaukar 3.1 in two new color optionsThe brand new historically-inspired Glaukar lens gives you an opportunity to create the type of image quality and feel of the early days of photography on modern equipment.  But even though the inside of the lens is state of the art technology, we have succeeded in keeping the modern version true to its legacy by not only maintaining the characteristic image quality but also replicating the Glaukar’s distinctive historic look.Portrait lenses of this time were using the typical plate camera format of 8cm x 10cm or 13cm x 18cm. Recalculating this to modern time lenses of 24mm x 36mm, the reinvented 97mm / f 3.1 Glaukar is equivalent to the original 3.1 / 210 of the 1910 Busch lens so it becomes a modern time lens with a focal length of 97mm.The new Glaukar will have the same brass appearance and silhouette as the original but will, in fact, be high-end aluminum with a brass-like oxidation, which ensures the durability and mechanical precision of a modern lens. Furthermore we believe that the look and feel of a lens is also part of the fun of using it.Expected delivery date of the lens is August 2018. Historical Emil Busch Glaukar F3.1 Anastigmat from 1910 (left)vs.the reengineered NEW Glaukar (right) The Emil Busch Glaukar portrait lens is not a copy of an old lens but in its reinvented form is a state of the art lens.

https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rathenower_Optische_Werke – gives you background and the history of this firm (but unfortunately its in German)
 We are going to work with companies that have a lot of experience in the production of photographic equipment.We have already been in touch with several possible production facilities who produce for leading manufacturers. But we have to be realistic in terms of the challenges on the way that we might have to face. We have a first prototype but it is always a challenge to go into serial production. This includes several steps and along the way problems might arise. We are sure we will solve all of them but it is hard to forecast them and the time needed to solve them. The new historic Emil Busch lens will be a lens of high quality and modern state of the art lens technology. So we will put quality above everything else which might lead to a slowdown of the production process. All our expected delivery dates are estimates only. Be assured that we will work very hard to get this beautiful lens into your hands as soon as possible.",40.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Book</h3>
<p>The Dancer's Facade: Dancing Through A Pandemic will focus on the journey of 10-15 dance professionals during the Covid-19 pandemic; allowing them to get in front of the camera and tell their stories through movement. Focusing on photographs, the book will also incorporate written text taken from oral interviews of each participant. The photographs will give the viewer access to the intimate and imaginative lives of the dancers; photographing them in their flats, public spaces, nature, empty theatres, and hopefully in empty museums. I see this book as a way to document this intense immobility we face juxtaposed against the simplistic beauty of movement. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project will give the dancers a chance to tell their personal experiences of this pandemic through movement and oral interviews. At the same time, it will give the audience an opportunity to reflect on their own immobile reality and their desire to move. Each individual in this project will be able to express their frustration, sadness, and hopefulness through their movement; while I document their journey through photographs.

<h3>Way Out - Volume I</h3>
<p>Concise, clean &amp; crisp. A year's work, broken out into four sections - each featuring a season, and each page following a color palette.</p>
<h4>About Nathan</h4>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Nathan Peterson is a self-taught photographer based in Montana, USA.</span></p>
<p>Growing up in Montana provoked an active lifestyle, so most of Nathan's free time was spent on the slopes in the winter and on trails in the summer. Due to a deep fascination of space, he began photography at the age of fifteen in order to get a deeper look at the night sky. Naturally, these hobbies met and developed a passion for 3am trail breaks, twelve-hour drives &amp; a taste for gas station snacks.</p>

<p>Nathan's biggest inspiration lies within the mountains of Northwest Montana, specifically Glacier National Park. Glacier has served as his stomping ground for the last three years - tallying up over thirty trips in that time. With that, Peterson seeks to find new perspectives &amp; views on every trip, while creating awareness of mankind's impact on earth and encouraging preservation through photography.</p>
<h4>The Book</h4>
<p>Way Out is the culmination of a year (almost exclusively weekends) spent on the road, photographing the Western United States &amp; Europe. With the primary focus being mood and color, it is divided by season.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>Contributions will be spent on:</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>- Airplane tickets to travel to, and within, the Philippines (approximately $2000).</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>- Local travel: jeepney, tricycle, taxi, bus.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>- Equipment: While R.J. has most sound equipment, he needs a camera body to produce short videos and capture illuminating photos (approximately $700).</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>- Expendables: R.J. needs media cards (SD, CF) as he may be without computer and hard drives for several days.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>- Conference fees (around $500).</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>- Fixers and translators: APEX would like to adequately support indviduals and groups that will assist in obtaining and interpreting interviews. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Note: ALL DONATIONS ARE TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Also, this trip will not cover R.J.'s personal amenties. This is NOT a vacation.</span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>The Impact</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>APEX Express intends to create connections to international struggles with those back here in the U.S. The inequalities, injustice, hopes, and dreams that Filipina/os experience in the Philippines parallels (or is even a cause) that of struggles who are disenfranchised in the United States.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>All of the reporting (radio, video, photographs) will be collected, edited, and uploaded on the APEX Express tumblr. The audio will be broadcast later this summer on APEX Express.</span></p>

Over the years, APEX has shared voices from around the world including anti-nuclear work in Japan, movement against land-grabbing in India, and voices in protest from Korea.
The Philippines is one of a number of developing countries at the frontlines of land-grabbing, massive industrialization, increased U.S. military presence, and economic shifts, and APEX has brought you the voice of Angie Ipong, who at age 60 was arrested and detained for six years as a political prisoner without due process. We've shared voices from the Center for People Empowerment in Governance (CenPEG), who drew similarities between a critique of the U.S. electoral process with the electoral process in the Philippines. 
This summer, we're expanding our reporting to send one of our contributors, R.J. Lozada, to the Philippines. With the help of APEX member Marie Choi and local journalists in the Philippines, he'll gather stories from the people most affected by the issues: organizations, activists, scholars, and members of other Filipino communities in the fields, the streets, the classrooms, and offices.

These scenes and access stand in direct contrast to some of the more short-sighted and problematic representations put out by the mainstream.   
What We Need
Contributions will be spent on:
- Airplane tickets to travel to, and within, the Philippines (approximately $2000).
- Local travel: jeepney, tricycle, taxi, bus.
- Equipment: While R.J. has most sound equipment, he needs a camera body to produce short videos and capture illuminating photos (approximately $700).
- Expendables: R.J. needs media cards (SD, CF) as he may be without computer and hard drives for several days.
- Conference fees (around $500).
- Fixers and translators: APEX would like to adequately support indviduals and groups that will assist in obtaining and interpreting interviews. 
Note: ALL DONATIONS ARE TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Also, this trip will not cover R.J.'s personal amenties. This is NOT a vacation.
The Impact
APEX Express intends to create connections to international struggles with those back here in the U.S. The inequalities, injustice, hopes, and dreams that Filipina/os experience in the Philippines parallels (or is even a cause) that of struggles who are disenfranchised in the United States.
All of the reporting (radio, video, photographs) will be collected, edited, and uploaded on the APEX Express tumblr. The audio will be broadcast later this summer on APEX Express.

<p>As an editorial photographer I have a great interest in human stories. When the ""Occupy Wallstreet"" protests spread to San Francisco I was riveted by the variety of people, and the diversity of those working together on the same goal. </p>
<p>I saw an opportunity here to photograph a lot of passionate people of all ages, races and walks of life, as well as a way to spread awareness and show the intensity that is human nature.  So I set aside a day and set up a small photo studio near the OccupySF protestors and took over 60 portraits. <br/></p>
<p>In less than 24 hours after <a href=""http://somephotographer.com/2011/10/09/the-99/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">posting</a>, the images had over 4,000 views. I was getting emails from people saying the work was wonderful and inspiring. Facebook and social media spread them like wildfire. News sources picked them up.  This was when I realized that this project needed to be bigger.</p>
<p>My goal is to travel to the major cities in California Participating in the Occupy Wallstreet protests and setup similar mini-photo-studios and create portraits of as many of the protestors as I can. These cities include but are not limited too:<br/></p>
<p>-LA<br/>-San Diego<br/>-San Jose<br/>-Santa Rosa<br/>-Oakland<br/>-Sacramento</p>
<p>And the list is growing. If things go well, I may expand to other parts of the country, the ultimate goal of course, being New York.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The ability to show the individual as a powerful person, a hero is vital to any campaign be it social, political or ethical. Raising awareness of the brave individuals involved will inspire others to take up this protest, hit the streets with their fellow man and stand up for what is right.</p>
<p>We need to show the world that everyone out there is rising up against tyranny - The people who wear suites, construction uniforms, scrubs, jeans, turtle-necks, tye-dye or simply shorts and a t-shirt - they are all standing strong, together.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The money will go primarily to flights, travel and hostels as well as food to keep myself and an assistant going. Remaining money will be donated to the Occupy Wallstreet movement. This project started on October 8th in San Francisco and I currently have contacts in Santa Rosa and San Jose. It's going, and it's not stopping. Your money will help me make it across the state, the country and if all goes will with the Occupy California fund raising, the world.<br/>If you help out, you will certainly be rewarded with prints, posters and even a signed, limited edition book.<br/></p>

Through hard work and perseverance, we are running a fundraiser to raise money by selling various products made from the results of a week of photography immersion. In our immersion week, we captured beautiful pictures of nature and interesting urban images throughout Tucson. The photographs taken were used in the creation of many products such as coasters, mouse pads, notebooks, calendars, and greeting cards. We are selling these products to raise funds for more enriching activities in the future. </p><p><strong>What We're Fundraising for:</strong></p><p>The money we raise is going to give us opportunities to go on field trips and ultimately have many educational experiences moving forward. </p><p>One of the most important field trips that the Middle School goes on is near the end of the year. We go on a three day trip to The University of Arizona’s Sky School on Mt. Lemmon. There, our focus is mostly centered around astronomy. Last year, due to the quarantine in March 2020, we did not go to Sky School. We are hoping that the COVID-19 situation will be more under control by the end of the year. </p><p>Another valuable experience in the Middle School is Drama Week, in which students practice playwriting, public speaking and more. This year, due to COVID-19, we are going to do Drama Week over Zoom, but that will not affect the benefits that Drama Week provides. </p><p><strong>Our Products:</strong></p><p>To create our unique photographs, we took high-quality pictures of nature and the things around us. Then, the images are added to our products, which include coasters, mouse pads, notebooks, calendars, greeting cards, and more. </p><p>If you continue to scroll down, you will see the different pictures we took, which we add to our products. You are also able to choose which picture you want for the products available. </p><p><strong>Our Goal:</strong> </p><p>This year, because of the unusual situation that COVID-19 has presented, we have  limited opportunities to make and sell things, but rest assured, the products we present are high quality and worth the charge. We hope that you enjoy the work we have done, and will help us reach our goal of 2,000 dollars. We would really appreciate it if you helped contribute to our cause. Thank you!</p><p> </p><p><strong>Here are our beautiful photos!  When you make a purchase, please try to include your photo choice with your name.  Otherwise, we'll email you to get your photo

twenty students from a Montessori middle school. Through hard work and perseverance, we are running a fundraiser to raise money by selling various products made from the results of a week of photography immersion. In our immersion week, we captured beautiful pictures of nature and interesting urban images throughout Tucson. The photographs taken were used in the creation of many products such as coasters, mouse pads, notebooks, calendars, and greeting cards. We are selling these products to raise funds for more enriching activities in the future. What We're Fundraising for:The money we raise is going to give us opportunities to go on field trips and ultimately have many educational experiences moving forward. One of the most important field trips that the Middle School goes on is near the end of the year. We go on a three day trip to The University of Arizona’s Sky School on Mt. Lemmon. There, our focus is mostly centered around astronomy. Last year, due to the quarantine in March 2020, we did not go to Sky School. We are hoping that the COVID-19 situation will be more under control by the end of the year. Another valuable experience in the Middle School is Drama Week, in which students practice playwriting, public speaking and more. This year, due to COVID-19, we are going to do Drama Week over Zoom, but that will not affect the benefits that Drama Week provides. Our Products:To create our unique photographs, we took high-quality pictures of nature and the things around us. Then, the images are added to our products, which include coasters, mouse pads, notebooks, calendars, greeting cards, and more. If you continue to scroll down, you will see the different pictures we took, which we add to our products. You are also able to choose which picture you want for the products available. Our Goal: This year, because of the unusual situation that COVID-19 has presented, we have  limited opportunities to make and sell things, but rest assured, the products we present are high quality and worth the charge. We hope that you enjoy the work we have done, and will help us reach our goal of 2,000 dollars. We would really appreciate it if you helped contribute to our cause. Thank you! Here are our beautiful photos!  When you make a purchase, please try to include your photo choice with your name.  Otherwise, we'll email you to get your photo choice.   Photos: #1 #2#3#4#5#6#7#8#9#10#11#12#13#14#15#16#17#18#19#20#21#22#23#24#25#26#27#28#29#30#31#32#33#34#35#36#37#38#39#40",40.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> My name is Bob Coleman and I have been a photojournalist for more than 25 years. In 2011 and 2012, I joined the mission team at St. Vincent de Paul Church in Rogers, AR to document their work in Haiti. The parish of St. Vincente de Paul supports the 14 schools and one high school of St. Francois by paying for the building and maintaining of schools, providing books and school supplies for the students and paying the salaries of the teachers and administrators.</p>
<p>Each year the mission team goes to Bombardopolis and checks on the work that has been done over that year and the progress of new projects. My job with the team was to photograph the students, the schools, and new projects in progress, and to help the parishioners in Rogers get a better picture of what life in Bombardopolis is like. The video (above) is the result of those visits and s used during the annual appeal to parishioners for future support of the mission.</p>
<p>There have been many changes since my last visit in 2012 and in a few short weeks, I will return to Bombardopolis to update my photos and the video. Most importantly, I will document the first high school graduation and the students who have worked so very hard to graduate. In addition to photographing the graduation day festivities, I will be making a series or portraits and conduct video interviews with these students to be used at the high school and back home in Rogers.</p>
<p>My immediate goal to finish funding the trip. I recently had a company sponsor back out of his pledged funds for business reasons he said were out of his control.That money would have been used to buy some essential photo and video accessories necessary to complete the job and a couple things in a wish list for use on the trip.</p>
<p>The most pressing things are memory cards for the video interviews, a portable hard drive to back up all my work, a video microphone, a variable grade neutral density filter for shooting video outdoors, and a lightweight travel tripod for the video interviews. </p>
<p>Finally, while not essential, I would love to bring a Fujifilm Instax instant camera and film to be used at the school visits. The students love it when they are able to get a picture of themselves and it helps me establish a positive relationship with them while I go about doing my work.</p>
</div><div><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p></div><div><p>There is a Haitian proverb, “Sa je pa wé, ké pa santi -   What the eye doesn’t see, the heart doesn’t feel.” It is my hope that when people view the work I will be producing their eyes will see and their hearts will feel some of what mine did when I made these images.This is the first ever graduating class from St. Francois d'Assise. Three students will receive scholarships to the university in Port au Prince.The impact on those students remains to be seen, but their story can help other students in the Bombardopolis schools be inspired to stay in school and graduate. The story can also inspire students here in Arkansas. </p></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Even though I have tried to coordinate time with the students with both the pastor of St. Francois and the administrators of the high school, nothing in Haiti is certain - even plans you thought were all worked out. I will get to photograph the graduates, I just do not know if I will have as much time as I hope to have with each one. One thing I have learned in the 25 plus years I worked in the newspaper world is to adapt and overcome obstacles to reaching your goal. That will be the theme of this trip.</p>

<p></p>
<p>In September 2014, my wife and I completed a 20 year dream and got
to visit the mountain gorillas of Rwanda. We experienced all that Rwanda had to
offer in an unforgettable five day adventure. From
the bustling capital city of Kigali to the beautiful mountains of the Volcanoes
National Park, it was a breathtaking experience from start to finish.</p>
<p>During our trip, we visited a local school that is supported
by the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund and got to spend time with some truly inspiring
children who touched our hearts and left us wanting to help them further. This
school is the children's opportunity to be educated, learn English as a second
language and make a better life for themselves.</p>
<p>The gratitude shown towards us was one of the most
genuine and moving experiences of our lives. We'll never forget the looks of
joy and the cheering we heard from the dozens of children that surrounded our
car when we gave them a soccer ball that we had hand carried from the US...
Their appreciation for something we think of as so simple left us wanting to do
more.</p>
<p>With that, we came up with the idea of creating a
photo book of our travels to share our experiences and give back to the local
community. We're looking for your help to support a wonderful cause: directly helping Bisate School in Rwanda, which is part of a group of organizations supported by the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund. <a href=""http://gorillafund.org/about_us"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://gorillafund.org/about_us</span></a>.</p>
<p>While our main campaign finished in December, we have now signed up to Indiegogo's InDemand option which means the campaign can continue raising money here indefinitely; so thanks for your time and we hope you can help!</p>
<p>This campaign is to raise enough money to directly help the school by first building a basketball court for all of the children to use and from there we can look at other ways to assist. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Since completing this campaign, we are raising money in a range of different ways; you can visit our Facebook page here: </span><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/5daysinrwanda"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">https://www.facebook.com/5daysinrwanda</a></p>

<p>
</p>
<p>My wife and I met in the summer of 1994 and became fast
friends with an awful lot in common.  One
of those things was a love of mountain gorillas, which came from watching
movies going all the way back to the original <i>King Kong</i> but encapsulated in the movie <i>Gorillas in the Mist</i>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>It was always our dream to visit the gorillas in person, but at the same
time we always felt it would be one of those “bucket list” items that we’d
never really achieve. I’m happy to say that twenty years later we achieved our
goal and got to experience these magnificent creatures in person, but as it
turns out, our trip ended up being much more than that.</p>

And document everything on film. </span><p></p>
<p>I spent some of the best days of the past two years like this, travelling from mountains to molehills, documenting the longboard-scene surrounding me. All the dancers, freeriders, downhill-racers, sliders, cruisers, slalom-geeks, all the die-hard-ladies and all the nice gentlemen I met on the hills, the parks and streets ... amazing. <br/>
»Faces of Longboarding« is a series of portraits and moods that provides a deep insight into the scene, a close look at people who really love that lifestyle, who travel from one end of europe to the other with no money, no sponsor, but tons of love and dedication.</p>

You can preorder your book here to make this all happen! 5700€ are needed to print 500 copies of the photobook and 100 screenprints, any cent above that goal is used to print more books, organize an exhibition and to cover productions-costs like film-development, scanning, etc. If the goal is not reached, your money ist not wasted of course!

I grab my camerabag, my longboard, a coffee and start again. Another day in baking sunshine, seeing faces, meeting longboarders from all over europe, making friends. And document everything on film. 
I spent some of the best days of the past two years like this, travelling from mountains to molehills, documenting the longboard-scene surrounding me. All the dancers, freeriders, downhill-racers, sliders, cruisers, slalom-geeks, all the die-hard-ladies and all the nice gentlemen I met on the hills, the parks and streets ... amazing. 
»Faces of Longboarding« is a series of portraits and moods that provides a deep insight into the scene, a close look at people who really love that lifestyle, who travel from one end of europe to the other with no money, no sponsor, but tons of love and dedication.
After two years I want to return some of the love I received, with this campaign I want to raise money to print a photobook with a best of of all the portraits I took. Preorder your book here, along with a limited screenprint or a set of postcards!Who am I?My name is André Kniepkamp, I'm a selftaught photographer who works and lives in Cologne, Germany. After long years of skating and surfing, I started longboarding a few years ago. Fascinated by the diversity of the scene I began with my »Faces of Longboarding«, an analog photo-project I was working on for the last two years. You can find the photos on my blog or follow the project on facebook.What I need and what you getI‘m going to print at least 500 hardcover-photobooks on FSC-certified 300gr paper at a print shop in Germany that focusses on sustainablitity regarding the use of paper, printing ink, electricity and shipping. The book will contain more than 150 analog photos on 120 pages! Furthermore I‘ll offer a set of postcards and a limited edition of numbered and signed screenprints on 250gr. recycling-paper in A3. (29,7x42cm) See a preview here! Each boook will be signed by me, too.
You can preorder your book here to make this all happen! 5700€ are needed to print 500 copies of the photobook and 100 screenprints, any cent above that goal is used to print more books, organize an exhibition and to cover productions-costs like film-development, scanning, etc. If the goal is not reached, your money ist not wasted of course! The book will be printed, because I strongly believe in that project and I hope you do, too. 

If you can‘t or don‘t want to spend any money, that‘s ok.
You can still help with sharing the link on facebook or any other social media platform using the menue on top of the page.1% For The PlanetI'm member of 1% For The Planet, that means, I obligate to donate 1% of my sales for the planet, pledging to support non-profit organizations focused on sustainability. So by buying the book you support the environment, too. Great, isn't it?1% For The Planet is an alliance of businesses that understand the necessity of protecting the natural environment.

<strong>THE PROGRAM</strong> We are the <strong>Dawson College Commercial Photography</strong> Graduates of Spring 2013. The goal of this program is to give graduating students the technical, visual &amp; business skills to perform commercial tasks typically done by self-employed or staff photographers in a manner that meets industry &amp; professional standards. We have been instructed in various aspects of professional photography including advertising &amp; editorial illustration, portraiture, catalogue photography, architectural photography, fashion photography, industrial photography &amp; digital imaging. In courses designed to cover both theory &amp; practice, we learned to use small &amp; large format cameras, tungsten &amp; electronic flash for studio or location lighting, &amp; computer imaging software for output &amp; media applications. Throughout the program, a mature &amp; disciplined approach to commercial photography was emphasized &amp; at the same time, we were encouraged to develop a personal creative vision of the world.</div>
<div align=""left""> </div>
<div align=""left"">
<strong>THE VERNISSAGE</strong> We have finally reached the culmination of all of our work – it is time to graduate, &amp; exhibit our work to friends, fans, potential clients &amp; buyers. We will be holding a Vernissage at Dawson College, &amp; we are in need of contributions to further our potential for success as we head into the workforce. That is where you come in -- your money will be helping to fund our Vernissage in order to make it the most impressive visual presentation possible.</div>
<div align=""left""> </div>
<div align=""left"">
<strong>THE GOAL</strong> We have 1500$ granted to us by the college, but that only goes so far with nearly 20 graduates. We are hoping to raise a total of 6000$. This money will go to the matting &amp; potential framing of portfolios, producing our promo book, refreshments for the exhibition, printing of posters &amp; so on. Regardless of whether we reach our entire goal or not, the money will be going straight to the Vernissage – we will produce our exhibition in the most economical &amp; visually inspiring manner with the funding we have. The more funding we have, the more effective our exhibit will be.</div>
<div align=""left""> </div>
<div align=""left"">
<strong>THE IMPORTANCE</strong> Some of us will soon be off to find employment in the field as assistants or employees, whereas others will be diving head first into opening their own studios &amp; businesses. This is not the only portfolio we will ever produce, but for many of us this Vernissage is a golden opportunity to get a head start in the industry here in Montreal. The reason this Vernissage is so important is due to the fact that industry professionals will be viewing our work -- these guests may provide possible business ventures for us in the future, &amp; we want to impress. We understand that not everyone can contribute a monetary value to our campaign -- however, you can still help by spreading the word or donating goods &amp; services to our exhibition. We really appreciate your help!</div>

Thank you, Thank you, Thank you so much for all of the support so far. There are still a number of rewards left, and we will continue taking donations as a result. Any money raised on top of the £8,000 goal is going to be used in order to ensure that the whole exhibition is exactly as we want it. There is a lot of work to be done in the next two weeks and we're excited to open our doors to you on the 14th of July. One love! Statement of purpose: What is Finding Soul about?Rohan Ayinde, Tayo Rapoport and Yewande “YoYo” Odunubi are three strands of the multi-vibrational movement of soul-vibe-bringers, Touching Bass.“Finding Soul” is their artistic collaboration, offering you a unique experience that is grounded in an appreciation and deep respect for the energy or “soul” of the people they move with.Starting with a series of portraits made by Rohan over the past two years, this exhibition is built around the premise that community, and the substance that holds any community together, is powerful, necessary, beautiful and important to share.Combining Rohan’s photography and poetry with Tayo’s filmmaking and YoYo’s spatial curation, this is about building an environment in which you are best placed to experience and be moved by an energy that we find constant inspiration from.We are passionate about making this exhibition happen for a number of reasons:First, as artists dedicated to making work that moves people and has the ability to spark discussion and provoke thought, we want to put this on for the simple desire to share.Second, as members of a community that we are inspired by, we want “Finding Soul” to create an environment which explores the essence of this inspiration and allows you to meditate on how to nurture your own spaces that reflect and/or complement the journey the exhibition takes you on.Lastly, we think that it has never been more important to examine and think about the importance of being part of communities that provide support, stimulation and purpose in a moment of increasing social fracturing and individualism. For us, starting a conversation and reflecting on the substance that brings and holds us together is the beginning of knowing how to build the kinds of spaces needed to challenge the structures that keep us divided.Where + When + What else?Finding Soul is being exhibited at Blank100, 100 De Beauvoir Road, Unit 5, London, N1 4ENFrom the 14th – 16th of JulyOpening Night: On Friday the 14th of July we’ll be having an opening evening of discussion that will serve as an introduction to the space and will set the energy for the following two days. Expect mellow vibes, good conversation, a bit of bubbly and great people. Closing Night: On Sunday 16th of July, join us for an evening of “pure vibrations” in collaboration with Touching Bass. This event will be a way to bring all the energy from the exhibition into a set of live performances. Expect poetry, music and a laid-back, meditative vibe. Details and tickets will be released soon.  The breakdown: How much is it going to cost?In order to make this exhibition as strong as possible and to allow us to pay close attention to the finest of details necessary to curate an experience that is cohesive, engaging and comprehensive we are aiming to raise £8,000.Below is a percentage breakdown of the costs: • Printing and Framing the photography – 50%• Venue hire, hanging, lighting, buying materials and transporting everything to and from the space – 25%  • Producing, editing and colour grading the final piece of audio-visual work – 8%• Indiegogo and card fees equal 8% of total money contributed, which means that if  when we’re successful we’ll have to shell out about £640 to Indiegogo and pals• And lastly we have to account for miscellaneous costs alongside fulfilling any rewards for all your warm, deeply appreciated and welcomed helpwhich leads us perfectly into the fun part:The perks: What do you get in return for your support?Your support, no matter how big or small, is what will make this exhibition a success – so, from the jump, we want to say thank you for anything you are able to contribute.All of the rewards are listed to the right →Some of the highlights:Soul Brother: We’re really excited to offer a limited edition chapbook of writing and photography by all three artists.

<h2>Short Summary:</h2>
<p>Hello, </p>
<p>My name is Anton Orlov and I am a photographic artist based out of San Diego, California.  I love traditional photography and have been printing my own black and white images for the past 23 years.</p>
2012 saw the birth of The Photo Palace Bus - traveling darkroom and gallery.  This was my dream for the past 15 years and I am very happy to see it come to life. </div>
<p><strong>The aim</strong> of The Photo Palace Bus is <strong>public education</strong> about the beauty and importance of traditional printmaking methods with the goal of <strong>inspiring the use of analog photography.</strong> While traveling Photo Palace offers the following programs:</p>
<p>• <strong>H</strong>istory of the Photographic Medium Exhibits</p>
<p>• <strong>M</strong>agic Lantern Slide Shows</p>
<p>•<strong> W</strong>orshops in Darkroom Techniques </p>
<p>• <strong>A</strong>lternative Printing Methods Workshops and Demonstrations</p>
<p>• <strong>P</strong>ortrait With Instant Imaging Technology</p>
<p>• <strong>D</strong>arkroom Consultations</p>
<p>and more....</p>
<p>You can get a good idea of my personal dedication by taking a look at the <a href=""http://thephotopalace.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>BLOG,</strong></a> which I kept during construction and the inaugural 9.300mi journey from California to Maine and back.</p>
<p><strong>During the second journey I would also like to compile a comprehensive survey of the state of analog photography today.  This will be done by conducting interviews with people associated with fine art photography focusing on traditional means of printmaking.  The interviews will appear on the blog</strong> <strong>and eventually published in a</strong> <strong>limited edition book</strong>.</p>
<p>The first of the interviews are already being conducted in San Diego area.  </p>
<div>Your support means a lot to me.  Any amount that you are comfortable with contributing will indeed make a big difference.</div>
<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>The $10.000 goal will go toward the following:</strong></p>
<p>• Construction of a foldout portrait studio mentioned in the kickstarter campaign - to make it RIGHT it's going to cost in the range of $3500-4000 (while converting the bus my personal funding simply ran out just short of being able to do that)</p>
<p>• Fuel and other traveling expenses</p>
<p>• Limited edition book publication</p>
<p>• Printing supplies such as paper and chemistry</p>
<p>• The rest will go to indiegogo and Paypal fees and expenses of printing and shipping the perks</p>
<h2><strong>Perks:</strong></h2>
<p>After the end of the campaign you will receive the wonderful perks that you chose.  The list is on the right so feel free to take a look and see what you feel tickles your fancy.</p>
<p><strong>Books</strong> will be printed at the end of the project (I project that to happen at the end of the summer) .  Please read through the list carefully and make a selection (or two or three -  nothing says you can’t contribute more than once, right?)</p>
<p>Are you in Continental United States?  One of the perks involves Gilli swinging by <strong>your</strong> town and giving a private lecture on historic processes illustrated by my collection of prints.  </p>
<p><strong>The $700 Perk</strong> - Unique Gelating Silver Mural Prints.</p>
<p>Here is a link to the gallery of prints where you can chose one for yourself:</p>
<p><a href=""http://orlovphoto.com/galleries/guetemala/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Guatemala Murals"">http://orlovphoto.com/galleries/guetemala/</a></p>
<p>The first two prints (Self Portrait and Incense Seller have been sold and are <strong>NOT</strong> available)</p>
<p>The rest of the imges are printed in edition of 1 each (except for Lake Atitlan which was printed in edition of 2).  These 30x30in fiber base silver ptints are truly beautiful and were printed on Foma Chamois Cream Tone paper giving them a wonderful old-world feel.  They were all captured on Rolleiflex TLR cameras and have stunning detail and clarity.  These are some of the best prints I have ever made (definitely the best mural prints by me).  It is impossible to reproduce them as the paper manufaturer has switched paper base and it no longer has the luster and texture that it used to have.</p>
<p><strong>As soon as a print is sold I will post a note about it here so you know what you have left to chose from.</strong></p>
<p><br/>Here is an example of the amazing detail of these prints.  Take a look at the image called 'Memory' and then take a look at this little close-up which is still not really as sharp as the real print.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The Impact:</strong></h2>
<p>My blog has been getting an ample amount of hits from all over the planet.  Readers come from all over the planet - North and South America, Europe, Asia and occasionally Africa and Australia as well.  Along with enjoying the adventurous and raw style of my writing I hope it inspired them to pick up that old Brownie, dust off their fathers Leica or invest into a 4x5.</p>
<p>By exposing the passion and the impetus of the artists working manually I hope to inspire a new generation of printers and innovators.  By providing folks with a list of both photo educational facilities and manufacturers of analog products I aim to give more business to them in the long run. </p>
<p>In the age when digital technology is expanding and changing faster than any one person can keep up with I hope to inspire people to discover the rewards that are brought by devoting their time and labor to making a print via analog means.  The magic of seeing a print emerge in a developer still touches many hearts.</p>
<p>As I pointed out my dedication to this cause is 110% - did the unsuccessful end to the kickstarter campaign stop me from investing every dime of my savings into this unique project?  No way!  I labored for months and spared no expense in making the presentation area and darkroom into an inviting and pleasant place to be in.  After that I took Gilli-the-Gillig on the road. Thousands of people were exposed to and educated about the history of photography though impromptu lectures and demonstrations.  The warm reception I received along the road inspired me to keep going and now I need your support.</p>
<h2><strong>Other Ways You Can Help:</strong></h2>
<p>There are a few ways you can help other than financial support (though that is what this project needs most)</p>
<p>• Let me know who you think I should interview.  Do you know someone who makes exquisite photo gravures?  Maybe you are friends with the manager of the film division of Kodak or Lomography?  Perhaps you know a high school or university photo teacher who has been inspiring young minds for decades now and loves what they do? </p>
<p>• <strong>HUGE</strong> help would be you posting this campaign on your <strong>Facebook</strong> page, in <strong>photo groups</strong> there or on other sites or just e-mailing the link to it to a good <strong>friend</strong> or <strong>family</strong> member who you know is in the fortunate position to be able to offer financial support to a dedicated artist.</p>

As I pointed out my dedication to this cause is 110% - did the unsuccessful end to the kickstarter campaign stop me from investing every dime of my savings into this unique project?  No way!  I labored for months and spared no expense in making the presentation area and darkroom into an inviting and pleasant place to be in.  After that I took Gilli-the-Gillig on the road. Thousands of people were exposed to and educated about the history of photography though impromptu lectures and demonstrations.  The warm reception I received along the road inspired me to keep going and now I need your support.
Other Ways You Can Help:
There are a few ways you can help other than financial support (though that is what this project needs most)
• Let me know who you think I should interview.  Do you know someone who makes exquisite photo gravures?  Maybe you are friends with the manager of the film division of Kodak or Lomography?  Perhaps you know a high school or university photo teacher who has been inspiring young minds for decades now and loves what they do? 
• HUGE help would be you posting this campaign on your Facebook page, in photo groups there or on other sites or just e-mailing the link to it to a good friend or family member who you know is in the fortunate position to be able to offer financial support to a dedicated artist.",1.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
Thousands landed at Normandy on D-Day, and every day their number dwindles.  I want to go document this years ceremonies while some still remain, to capture the images and stories that I can, so that they are saved for generations to come, so that they are not lost in the sands of time. </div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; Why</h3>
<p>What I am seeking is at least $6500.00 for three weeks to meet survivors and others; document as muc as I can; and, process that into things that can be shared: </p>
<p>• $2000 -- transportation, and while this seems high, it costs more than this to get there if I am in Afghanistan as I hope to be</p>
<p>• $1000 -- lodging, and the closer I get the more expensive it gets</p>
<p>• $750 -- Car rental, with full insurance</p>
<p>• $1050 -- per diem: food, drink, fuel, and other expenses</p>
<p>• $800 -- monthly insurance costs for my travel/embed insurance</p>
<p>• $900 -- fees associated with fundraising</p>
<p>Anything raised above this will go to:  computer upgrades for improved processing capabilities; travel/combat insurance costs; improved photographic capabilities; and, other expenses of doing this trip and/or embeds with U.S. and Allied troops.  If total funding is not raised, donations will go towards:  fees, travel/embed insurance, lodging, airfare, and rental car.  I will make it stretch as far as I possibly can. </p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>You should get something too, so: </p>
<p>• $1-$49:  a thank-you e-mail</p>
<p>• $50 donation:  electronic copy (watermarked) of the Normandy stained glass window seen above</p>
<p>• $100 donation:  limited signed/numbered edition 8x10 print of the stained glass photo, limited to 25 donors</p>
<p>• $500 donation:  limited signed/numbered edition 11x14 print of the stained glass photo, limited to 15 donors</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The veterans of D-Day are fast leaving us.  Of those that are left, very few will be able to make the trip this year, and as for next year, it is possible that we may see no veterans there.  My goal, my dream, is to go document this year's events, the participants -- and, where possible, their stories.  I want to share what I do via posts on my blog and at Blackfive online military magazine; via video; and, through e-books and maybe even a print book that shares the images of today for future generations.  </p>

<h3>One sleepless night I had a crazy idea, an idea so crazy that it just might work...</h3>
<p>I thought to myself, what if I could take a series of photos that showed the beauty of the human body without specifying a gender and allow the viewer of the imagery to decide for themselves if they found the image attractive or not.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>

<p>The cost of this is going to be several thousand dollars to achieve, and I am asking for help with the framing and presentation of the imagery, which is approx NZ$200/image, I would like to display at least 10 images, which means I need to raise at least NZ$2000 (US$1618).  The  more I raise the more images I will create.</p>

<p>I would really like to get this imagery out into the public face, and expand on the concept, to show that some males can be feminine, and females masculine, and both as beautiful.</p>

<h3>About the project</h3>
<p>In 1977 photographs by American photographer Chuck Fishman, appeared in a book called <i>Polish Jews: The Final Chapter</i>. All of them were taken in 1975, when Fishman visited Poland for the first time as a student. They were a record of his meetings with Polish Jews living in the realities of People’s Poland — the last survivors of the Shoah and the few descendants of a community that had once numbered three million, but had been nearly wiped out in the Holocaust and further diminished by subsequent waves of post-war emigration.</p>
<p>The photographs by Fishman, who visited Poland several more times in the 1970s and 1980s, set out to capture the final chapter in the history of Polish Jewry. Fishman sought to perpetuate the memory of a community disappearing before his very eyes. He worked mainly in large cities, formerly important Jewish centres, where Jewish life somehow still ‘smouldered’. He took photographs in Kraków, Wrocław and Warsaw, as well as in Lublin, Łódź and Przemyśl, where only a handful still cultivated their Jewishness.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540301680/yjbbwvnqnm3ym5ko6avy.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The systemic change of 1989 had an enormous impact on Jewish life in Poland. For many, it meant the possibility of rediscovering their roots, reconstructing their Jewish identity, exploring their ancient traditions or being able to discuss openly the complex Polish-Jewish relations. The process of the revival of Jewish communities began. On leaving Poland in 1983, Fishman could not have imagined the photographs he would take 30 years on in democratic Poland. His pictures from the 2010s often feature laughing young Jews of the third and the fourth generation after the Holocaust.</p>
<p>43 years have passed between the taking of the earliest and latest photographs presented in the exhibition, making Fishman’s project one of the most comprehensive photographic records of European Jewry in the second half of the twentieth and the beginning of the twenty-first centuries. In the first part, the exhibition features photographs presenting the realities of the 1970s and 1980s. When viewed from today’s perspective, these images, now etched in the consciousness of people around the world, reflect stereotypical ideas about the continuing realities of Jewish life in Poland.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540301703/bosb79cwqjznpy8x61ck.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>However, the earlier vision is almost deliberately supplanted by another one emanating from the photographs displayed in second part of the exhibition: depicting a diverse and rejuvenated community pursuing their normal lives, albeit “in the shadow of Auschwitz”.</p>
<p>All of the photographs are in black-and-white. The artist took a conscious decision to document contemporary Jewish life in Poland with the same artistic resources he used in the 1970s and 1980s. This treatment not only makes the entire collection visually coherent, but also demonstrates that the atmosphere or significance of photographs is not driven by the chosen black-and-white tones — the new photographs emanate optimism, energy and hope.</p>

<p>In addition to the Fishman’s photographs the photobook will also include essays by the renowned journalists, artists and historians Konstanty Gebert, Stanisław Krajewski, Ruth Ellen Gruber and Jason Francisco. As a result, the publication will have an impact beyond the exhibition’s run time by preserving the story of the unique transformation of Jewish Poland for future generations.</p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510069693/xfrglfnrtk06kdtk2ex5.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>There were several events that lead to the birth of When The Blackbird Sings in 2016. The abundance of tiny streams heading on the same route to finally rejoicing and creating that huge roaring flood, tearing through the landscape of both subconscious and social structures.</p>
<p>How shall I put it?</p>
<p>2016 was pretty tough. . It was a combination of the loss of a grandmother and world leaders who seemed high on testosterone, meanwhile I was overdosing on another hormone to create life. It never grew, but another seed came to develop. A seed that was for Her and the female aspects of Earth. In the darkness of last years super new moon I knew that it wasn't my story I sought to tell, it was HERstory. I knew that to make me stronger I had to I truly see Her. </p>
<p><strong>I  photographed women during a whole year; every full and new moon and only at twilight. </strong></p>
<p>Each twilight is heralded by the song of the blackbird. In this role, the blackbird is cast as a messenger, here to remind us of our mortality and vitality.  Her song also gave me refuge all through last year. The bird called me into awareness of my ever-changing nature and my inner cycles. When The Blackbird Sings’ specifically consider the lunar-led bonds and binds of time in fertility; the changing seasons as being a dialogue with our own inner cycles; how these periods are represented in nature. </p>
<p>In spring 2016 I was holding my grandmother's hand in the hospital. Her thin hand reminded me of a leaf in the end of November. It was a diaphanous piece, baring veins and structures in the most delicate way, it was like the only life she had left inside her was shining through her thin luminescence skin. I still miss her, immensely. </p>

<p><strong>Birth and Death - The Ultimate Creation</strong></p>
<p>I know it sounds like tall tale, but with these life changing events The Blackbird started to sing. The bird sang so loud I knew that I had to carry on photographing. The work brought a great group of women together and what a group.  Women,  you know who you are;  my mother, friends, daughters, witches and grandmothers.  You are proud and strong women, baring yourself during the L’Heure Bleu showing the surrounding  world how we are all full of life and blood. </p>

<p><strong>Why am I here at Indiegogo?</strong></p>
<p>I have now 24 (for all the new and full  moons during 1 year) pieces that will be exhibited in 2018 at Arusha Gallery here in Edinburgh/Scotland. The show is going up on the first of March and  taken down 5 days after the Spring Equinox. </p>
<p>I am now looking into funding phase two; frames, print and event.  I know that is just one line, BUT its essential.  The photographs will need to enter our world, to actually exist (something we can touch).  Can you help?</p>

<p>My name is Paige Ormiston and I am currently working towards a double major in both Computer Science and Design at Western Washington University. I am passionately in love with photography and have devoted myself to taking a photo every day for 1 year, known as my Project 365.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I was visiting a friend in Bellingham and brought along my brand new 13"" Macbook Pro in order to post my photos of the day for the weekend. During the 8-10 person get-together, someone knowingly spilled water on my keyboard and refuses to confess to their accident. Even people who claim to have witnessed it happen are still ""clueless"" as to who did it.</p>
<p>After shipping my laptop off to Texas for Apple repair, I am now facing up to <strong>$755</strong> in damages, and simply cannot afford to pay for someone else's mistake. Right now, I am left with a broken laptop, and a complete feeling of betreyal and hopelessness.</p>
<p>Without a fixed laptop, I cannot continue on with the Design program in the fall, and it is difficult to pursue my beloved Project 365 as well as other photoshoots and side projects.</p>

<p>As a ""local voyager"" of communities near and far, I am about to embark on the next leg of my photographic journey: the 1000 Shillings program has offered me a unique and powerful oporutnity to work as a photography fellow in Namatala, Uganda this summer.</p>
<p>1000 Shillings is a non-profit dedicated to women's empowerment in developing nations. The organization provides six local Ugandan women artists with a global marketplace for their products and microgrants to start their own sustainable businesses. These efforts aim to alleviate poverty for these women and their families, effecting tangible change in their lives. Through this fellowship, I will work closely with the women of Namatala and other 1000 Shillings fellows as we share their stories and strive to connect our global communities. It is thrilling to be a part of this meaningful and cooperative enterprise.</p>
<p>The funds raised through this campaign will cover my travel and living expenses in Uganda, a portion of which will also support the women artists with whom we work.

Among the award winning young artists, two of their number have been shortlisted for Student Photographer of the Year for their respective fashion and still life photography.</p>
<p>The city recently hosted the Format Photography Festival, within which the students have taken active roles, from assisting festival Patron Brian Griffin, to hosting live photography projects for participants from around the world.</p>
<p>LUX'13 Commercial Photographers will be exhibiting at the degree show in Derby at Markeaton Street Campus from 31<sup>st</sup> May to 11<sup>th</sup> June 2013, and the renowned Menier 'Chocolate Factory' Gallery in London from 25th-29th June.

I need more and better lighting systems
a few new lens's would great increase the quality of my work
Budgets for big concept photoshoots. so far I've been doing everything on a free budget I am a DIY kinda guy but it only gets you so far I would like to be able to pay for Make up artist/models/amazing locations.
A new computer mine has a habit of restarting whenever it wants, it barley runs the editing software I use.

<p>I once had a sony DMC RX-100. It was my pride and joy. when I bought it, it became my primary camera. (I have a not so portable 5d) . It was small. I could fit it into my shirt pocket.

<h3>Hi I'm Shelley!</h3>
<p>My name is Shelley Koon.  I'm a photographer who finds beauty in the forgotten and damaged. My photography career spans over 30 years with the last three focusing on photographing abandoned structures.</p>
<p>I'm running this campaign to assist in funding the printing, matting and framing of my photos for my first solo exhibit ""Wither: Exploration of the Forgotten."" </p>
<h3>Why should you send me your hard earned dollars?</h3>
<p>I put a lot of time and energy into my art - it truly is my passion, heart, and soul. This exhibit is a fantastic opportunity for me to get my art in front of a broader audience of both patrons and those in the art industry (gallery directors, photo directors, etc.) that could lead to more work, bigger projects, and more access into the abandoned areas I love so much.</p>
<h3>What will I do with your hard earned dollars?</h3>
<p>I'll  print, mat, and frame 20 - 25 prints for the show.  The cost for each print is $114 dollars so I'm looking at roughly $2,900 - $3,300 total.</p>
<p>I've saved enough to cover a third of that, but when I get into the higher numbers I start considering selling kidneys...  Joking!  Kind of...</p>
<p>I still have other costs associated with the show such as music, hors d'oeuvres, wine/beer, soda and water which I will be covering myself - I'm just looking for help with printing and framing.</p>
<p>I've put together some perks that I'm pretty excited about.  These are far below market value but I am excited to give out some really cool stuff to those who support me in making this show happen!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>When you help me, you help us all.</h3>
<p>I have the honor of knowing so many great photographers who focus on abandoned structures and spaces.  By helping me with my exhibit you help this genre of photography gain exposure and further legitimize its inclusion in a gallery setting.  This opens up opportunities for other photographers as it encourages collectors and appreciators of fine art photography to seek out similar work.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help:</h3>
<p>I totally get not being able to assist monetarily (that's the whole reason I'm running this campaign right?) but there are other things you can do to support me that do not require pledging dollars!</p>
<p>Please share this campaign with your social community!  Indegogo makes it easy with the sharing tools!</p>
<p>If you're local come to the opening of the exhibit!</p>

</p><p>My name is Mickey Aloisio and I’ll be graduating from the Fashion Institute of Technology in May. I have been working on my senior thesis for two years now. I decided to create a body of work of gay bear men as a way for me to be a part of the community and meet new people. Below is a short statement describing the project: </p>
<p>
</p><p><i>“Gay Wildlife” brings together images from two years of venturing into the homes of heavier gay men within New York City and the surrounding areas to explore issues of identity, body image and belonging. This work speaks about the specific tendency within gay culture to lump people together into categories based on the archetypes of their body.</i></p>
<p>
</p><p><i>This project is presenting the chance to get inside of one of these supposedly explanatory groupings known as bears, and show the diversities and the multitudes of expression and personalities within it. The resulting images of these men and the domestic spaces they inhabit, examine how each subject is so very distinct, as well as their precise regard for the camera. In a lot of ways, Gay Wildlife is a direct continuation of my interest in and exploration of what it means to be a gay male in todays society. </i></p>
<p>
</p><p>This project is important to me because I came to the city two years ago and up until that point I had no gay friends, never went to a gay bar, nor have I ever really participated in any type of gay event. Then, because of this project I’ve had the chance to explore all over the city and it's surrounding boroughs in order to meet a bunch of new and incredible people. Since then I have made some very important and close friends and have created terrific bonds with them that I hope will continue to remain a lasting friendship. </p>
<p>
</p><p>By contributing to this project you will be helping to create an edition of books of this body of work. I am hoping to be making 50 copies of the book.  I'm a student right now who's in the process of graduating and I do not have the money I would need in order to create the books on my own. Making a book is very expensive, but the more people that are interested in buying one, the less the cost of making the books become. Making a book means that this work will be in the hands of more people. I think its important to have work that celebrates subcultures within the gay community, as well as celebrating issues of body image, acceptance and belonging out in the world. By supporting young queer artist’s spread their vision, art and hard work we are supporting the success and the aiding mentality of LGBT community as a whole. We are together making something that is very meaningful to so many people.  </p><br/></div>","My name is Mickey Aloisio and I’ll be graduating from the Fashion Institute of Technology in May.

<h2>Hi everyone, thanks for reading this!</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Yvette and I have been a photographer for a few years now. Whilst having started photographing on a film camera, I have worked in several photography studios using both film and digital cameras - and after working for art dealer Linus Carr, my interest in old techniques was sparked. Since then, my digital camera has been gathering dust as my TLR took preference.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>BUT!</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Recently, I managed to buy <strong>a rather old, and rather large camera (16 x 16"")</strong> - alas without lens or other materials. Even though I had enough funds to buy the camera and the lens myself (to arrive this week), I could use a hand with gathering the materials needed to actually start creating images with it. It would mean a huge shift in what and how I will photograph things - and I believe it will create a huge leap forward in regards to my work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In sponsoring this project you will not only help me achieve creating unique images within a much shorter time frame, you will help keep an art form alive and even have the oppertunity to own some of the original images created.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>During the creation of these works, I will make notes/ images on the process and share them with the world. Any processes I find particularly useful will be shared so that everyone will be able to use them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I plan on making<strong> Calotypes</strong>, <strong>Paper negatives and Ambrotypes</strong>. I would like to create <strong>portraits</strong>, both realistic and fantastic, working with models and regular people alike as well as explore parts of my Dutch heritage, either within <strong>stillife </strong>or<strong> landscape</strong> images.</p>
<p> </p>
The funds will go towards:<br/><p>Board to place underneath the camera, Tripod/ Cart</p>
<p>Portable darkroom tent</p>
<p>Additional Plateholders for this camera (I have 1, the others will have to be custom built)</p>
<p>Trays for development</p>
<p>Chemicals</p>
<p>Chemical bottles for storage of mixed liquids (if applicable)</p>
<p>Protective gloves/ apron</p>

<p>Professional scanning of the best images + archival printing</p>
<p>And ofcourse........</p>
<p> </p>
<p>postage of these images to my sponsors!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the final target does not get reached, any raised funds will go towards basic materials so I will still be able to get started, and begin documenting the process, which you will be able to follow on my website <a href=""http://www.yvettebessels.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.yvettebessels.com</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I <em><strong>really</strong></em> appreciate your consideration to help me out (seeing you've read this far down) and would like to thank you in advance if my project is something you'd be willing to sponsor.</p>

Risks & Challenges

One of the major challenges with this sort of work is in building relationships and trust with people for them to be comfortable with sharing their story with you.
Having already made an initial visit for a week in June I have contacts who will help introduce me to more people whose stories can be told. The six week time frame of this project also allows me to make multiple visits to people and build a stronger rapport with them.

<p><strong>Worum geht’s hier eigentlich?</strong></p>
<p>Einige haben es mitbekommen, für andere ist es komplett neu, aber im Jahr 2016 habe ich erfolgreich mein erstes Buch <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/snapshot-stories-music-book/x/8592971#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Snapshot Stories</a> durch diese Plattform finanzieren lassen. Nach unglaublich gutem Feedback, fünf Ausstellungen, Radiointerviews und einem Arte Tracks Beitrag zu dem Buch und meiner Selbst (erscheint Ende des Jahres) ist die logische Schlussfolgerung: weiter machen.<br/><br/>Was macht man aber wenn die Erwartungen jetzt so hoch sind? Beinahe täglich gingen neue Nachrichten in meinem Postfach ein in denen ich Lob, Kritik aber auch Dankbarkeit dafür erfahren konnte, dass ich verstorbene Familienmitglieder mit ins Buch aufgenommen habe und somit eine Plattform der Verarbeitung geschaffen habe. Das erhöht natürlich den Druck und auch die Erwartung, die ich an mich selbst stelle.<br/><br/>Es wird kein zweiter Teil von <a href=""http://www.pascalkerouche.com/?page_id=7075"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Snapshot Stories</a> werden, den wird und kann es auch nie geben. Das Buch hat in seiner Geschichte einen Zeitraum von 12 Jahren abgedeckt. Mein Leben hat sich seitdem geändert: Ich lebe in Deutschland, habe mittlerweile ein Kind und alles hat sich relativ ""normalisiert"". Zumindest so normal, wie es in meiner Realität werden kann. Dennoch ist das kein Grund aufzuhören, sondern weiterzumachen.<br/><br/>Das kommende Buch wird den Titel <strong>Zwei Null Eins Sieben</strong> tragen. Der Name ist allerdings eine Lüge denn es trägt den Titel nur, weil es 2017 rauskommt, sich aber keinesfalls auf dieses eine Jahr beschränken wird sondern ungefähr 2014 oder 2015 losgeht.<br/><br/>Neben ein paar Bildern aus <strong>Amerika</strong> wird es diesmal auch in die Hood von <strong>Jamaica</strong> gehen, und auch das Leben auf den <strong>Philippinen</strong> zeigen. Auch Deutschland wird nicht zu kurz kommen: exklusive Einblicke in die ‪<strong>187 Strassenbande</strong> und quer durch Deutschland mit Rapper<strong> ‪Estikay</strong>. Wie auch schon bei Snapshot Stories werden die Geschichten zu den jeweiligen Bildern erzählt.<br/><br/>Das Buch ist weit davon entfernt fertig zu sein. Das Jahr läuft ja auch noch ein wenig und ich möchte bis Dezember noch möglichst viel mitnehmen beziehungsweise aufnehmen (und noch die ein oder andere Reise machen). Somit ist es schwer einzuschätzen, welchen Umfang das ganze haben wird aber es wird mindestens genauso viel Content wie Snapshot Stories besitzen – <strong>mindestens 228 Seiten</strong>.<br/><br/>Ihr könnt mir helfen die Kosten für den Druck zu decken, indem ihr euer Exemplar des Buches <strong>Zwei Null Eins Sieben</strong> vorbestellt. Der Vorteil für dich, wenn du das Buch jetzt schon vorbestellst ist, dass du es für 30 Euro bekommst – später wird es 40 Euro kosten.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h3>Nomuka Island, Kingdom of Tonga</h3><p>In the spring of 2016 I spent six weeks documenting daily life and taking family portraits of the inhabitants of the small island of Nomuka. I’m raising money to send printed portraits back to each family and a 100+ page printed book that contains a mixture of documentary images and all the family portraits.</p><p> </p><h3>About Me</h3><p>My name is David Clumpner and I am a <a href=""http://www.davidclumpner.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">photographer</a> from Montana in the US.  I served in the Peace Corps in Palau, a small island in the western Pacific in the early 2000s. During my years there I became interested in creating a printed record of the families who inhabit small islands, as they often have little to no means to create this for themselves. This is the third iteration of this project (previously Palau and Okinawa) but the first to include documentary imagery of daily life and a printed book.</p><p> </p><h3>About Nomuka</h3><p>Nomuka is a very small island at the southern end of the Ha'apai Island Group in central Tonga.  About 400 residents live on the island, which is a six-hour ferry ride from the capital, Nuku'alofa.  Religion is a very important element of the culture, with seven churches on the island and up to six services/week depending on your denomination.

I’m raising money to send printed portraits back to each family and a 100+ page printed book that contains a mixture of documentary images and all the family portraits. About MeMy name is David Clumpner and I am a photographer from Montana in the US.  I served in the Peace Corps in Palau, a small island in the western Pacific in the early 2000s. During my years there I became interested in creating a printed record of the families who inhabit small islands, as they often have little to no means to create this for themselves. This is the third iteration of this project (previously Palau and Okinawa) but the first to include documentary imagery of daily life and a printed book. About NomukaNomuka is a very small island at the southern end of the Ha'apai Island Group in central Tonga.  About 400 residents live on the island, which is a six-hour ferry ride from the capital, Nuku'alofa.  Religion is a very important element of the culture, with seven churches on the island and up to six services/week depending on your denomination. There is only electricity for six hours a day and very few residents have computers or cameras. Women weave very time-intensive mats made from dried pandanus to sell to Tongans living in the capital or abroad while men spend much of their time growing and collecting food. The kids attend one of two primary schools or the Methodist high school, then after class they fly homemade kites around the village. Why This Project is ImportantNomukans have smartphones but no way of backing up their photos.  The environmental conditions in the tropics can be fierce on electronics, so it's common for a phone to die and take its memory with it.  For this reason and the speed with which our society moves to new forms of digital media, I believe strongly in printed photos as the best form of passing memories down to future generations.  During my six weeks on Nomuka I photographed nearly every family on the island (70+ portraits).  Each family will receive two 8x10 laminated (to protect against humidity) enlargements and about ten 4x6 prints to share with family and friends.I did an Indiegogo campaign for my previous family portrait project on Angaur, Palau a few years ago.  About six months after mailing the family portraits I got word of an accident where three men overturned their fishing boat and were swept out to sea.  A few months later I received this message from the widow, whose only visual memory of her husband was in the family portrait I sent her: ""Am so glad for your great efforts for your project.

<h3>The Project</h3>
<br/>Help us frame our exhibition on Beauty Shop Culture! I am an award-winning photographer, author (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Counter Culture: The American Coffee Shop Waitress)</span> and owner of <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Taylor Made Culture</span> (<a href=""http://www.taylormadeculture.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.taylormadeculture.com</a>). We produce multimedia projects that document various aspects of American culture. The<span style=""font-style: italic;""> Beauty Shop Culture </span>exhibition features longstanding salons that have served communities for decades. It celebrates multiculturalism and promotes a greater 
understanding and appreciation for our cultural differences. Although there have 
been studies of barbershop culture, the beauty shop has been 
comparatively overlooked. This visual anthropology project will examine 
all aspects of the beauty salon as a cultural institution, including its 
role in developing and maintaining community. The exhibition with eventually travel throughout the United States.<p><br/></p>
<h3>What We Need <br/>
</h3>
<p>We are so close! We have received 2 grants to document the salons and now we are seeking funding to frame the exhibition so it can tour the US. There are a total of 40 images, ten at 20 x 30 inches and thirty at 13 x 19 inches. Each image will cost approximately $120 to frame ($120 x 40 = 4800). If we don't reach our funding goal, we will frame as many photographs as possible.<br/></p>

</div></div>","The Project
Help us frame our exhibition on Beauty Shop Culture! I am an award-winning photographer, author (Counter Culture: The American Coffee Shop Waitress) and owner of Taylor Made Culture (www.taylormadeculture.com). We produce multimedia projects that document various aspects of American culture. The Beauty Shop Culture exhibition features longstanding salons that have served communities for decades. It celebrates multiculturalism and promotes a greater 
understanding and appreciation for our cultural differences. Although there have 
been studies of barbershop culture, the beauty shop has been 
comparatively overlooked. This visual anthropology project will examine 
all aspects of the beauty salon as a cultural institution, including its 
role in developing and maintaining community. The exhibition with eventually travel throughout the United States.
What We Need 

We are so close! We have received 2 grants to document the salons and now we are seeking funding to frame the exhibition so it can tour the US. There are a total of 40 images, ten at 20 x 30 inches and thirty at 13 x 19 inches. Each image will cost approximately $120 to frame ($120 x 40 = 4800). If we don't reach our funding goal, we will frame as many photographs as possible.

<p><b>BUT WAIT! THERE'S MORE!</b></p>
<p>Next, we've got photoshoots! <b>Whether you need a headshot, an engagement photo, a family portrait, or if you want to pose as Zeus hurling lightning from a cloud bank, all things are possible with perks!</b></p>
<p>Check out the options to your right. Don't see something you want? Feel free to contact me and let me know what you're thinking. <b>By succeeding with this campaign, it means that I can take all kinds of photographs for all kind of people, reasons, and prices. </b></p>
<p><b>Headshots</b> include the basics. Hair/makeup not included, though I can (and will) touch you up as needed. I know nothing about styling men's hair. Don't even ask. Images will be retouched to your satisfaction (within reason). Bring any wardrobe changes you want. Whether you're updating your decade-old 8x10 or if it's your first time, I'll be gentle and understanding, and work with you at your own pace to get great photos.</p>
<p>You may notice that a <b>milestone photo</b> (engagement/wedding/family/pregnancy portrait, etc.) costs significantly more than a headshot. This perk is for when you want something just a much more special than a standard portrait. It will be personal, beautiful, and just what you want. I approach my portraits with the idea that they will be as beloved and treasured as, say, a painted family portrait, passed down through the generations.  While it will not be a production on the scale of a more elaborate pre-Raphaelite photo, these photos can include themes, sets, etc., within reason. Steampunk engagement photos! Dramatic, Vogue-esque new baby photos! (Is there such thing as an old baby?) <b>This package is <i>very</i> unique in the fact that you will receive digital copies for reproducing these images</b> (for your own personal use only--as wedding invitations, backup prints, etc.). This is your image for life!</p>
<p><b>Pre-Raphaelite photos</b> are much more involved, both before and after the shoot. For these photos, I will work with you to provide and/or supplement wardrobe, props, and sets. The style, story, and location will be researched thoroughly prior to the shoot. Poses will be mapped out, storyboards drawn and locations perfected. The complexity of my initial photos increased with my experience, and I will continue that. An estimated 30-40 hours of retouching will go into each final photo. Creative decisions are ultimately my own--with this perk, I am pledging to deliver a stunning, beautiful photograph, so you're going to have to trust me. You will not receive a digital copy of the image(s), but you will have the opportunity to receive your print at whatever size you choose, up to 6', for only the additional material cost of printing.</p>
<p><b>""I want to purchase a photo perk but I can't do it before March 28th! Why are you discriminating against the date-challenged?!""</b></p>
<p>Hey, man, hey! Chill! Send me a message (<a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/individuals/5670251"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">contact user</a>) and let's talk it out, yeah? I'm sure we can solve this challenge.</p>
<p></p>
<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;""><b> NOW OFFERING PRINTS!</b></h3>
<p>As requested, you can now purchase prints! Photos will be printed on velvety-soft, archival matte paper. Since my photos vary quite a bit in their dimensions, the title and blank paper will fill in for the odd sizes. Persephone, for example, will be exactly 11""x14"" and will not feature a title. Please contact me if you would like the image smaller and a title added!</p>
<p>For odd sizes, the image will appear similarly to this:</p>

<h3><b>""Why Do YOU Deserve My Money?""</b></h3>Great question.<p></p>
<p>I could give you a sob story about how I need a camera to make money to pay for my cats' vet bills. I could not-so-subtly work it into my campaign text by saying ""I could give you a sob story about--""</p>
<p><b></b><b>Look, only you can decide if my cause is worth your money. </b>So for my part, I'm trying to give you your money's worth; you have my gratitude if you contribute, but you deserve more than gratitude. <b>You're helping me when I need it most, and I want to give back. </b>The postcards are a way for me to do that on a smaller scale, while representing my work and giving you something you can use and admire. The other perks are things that I can give back, things that maybe you can't buy in a store. Who else would you turn to for a portrait of you and your six brothers as the seven dwarves? No, don't tell me, I hate competition.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b>""What Happens If You Don't Meet Your Goal?""</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>It sucks. But not for you. </p>
<p>The cheapest decent DSLR on the market is about $500. If I make less than that, I will borrow/rent a camera to complete any photo perks that have been purchased. If I make more than that, I will buy the best camera &amp; lenses that I can afford, and leftover will go toward accessories (memory cards, batteries) and future photography projects. <b>Not a single cent of your money will be wasted. All perks will be fulfilled, all postcards shipped.</b> Do you trust me? Then hop on my magic carpet.</p>

<h3>More About the Pre-Raphaelite-Inspired Photos</h3>
<p>Though I can draw decently well, I've never been able to wield a paintbrush. What do you do when your favorite artists don't work in your preferred medium? You fake it, of course.</p>
<p>My goal was to create rich, beautiful images that <i>felt</i> like paintings, but didn't use artificial brushstrokes or other such gimmicks.</p>
<p>One of my favorite aspects of the pre-Raphaelite style was their commitment to storytelling. Growing up, I listed greek myths and fairy tales among my favorites, and once I was old enough to understand it, I added Shakespeare. These are classic tales, recognizable by most people, young or old--but even if you don't know who the figures are, I needed the story to be told on its own.</p>
<p>So I needed the composition, the lighting, the subject matter, to all hearken back to the pre-Raphaelite masters. And they had to be BIG. Romeo &amp; Juliet ended up being 3'x6' once printed, set in a gorgeous, ornate frame that weighed approximately four tons. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.548970277499.2050344.49802456&amp;type=1&amp;l=b0d5f1eef0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Check out the final show here. Placards are 4""x5"" for scale.</a><br/></p>
<p>There were hits and there were misses, mostly due to time and budget constraints, and sometimes the weather. 'Persephone' ended up not including a giant chasm in the earth because, well, nobody would lend me an industrial excavator.  As a result, the story isn't obvious at first glance.</p>
<p>There were serendipitous moments, though, mixed with hard work; one of my professors had a stream running through her backyard, and with a bit of digging and dam-building, we had a pond perfect for 'Echo and Narcissus'. Take a peek at Narcissus' reflection and you'll see Echo's in the water as well. Nice.</p>
<p>In the end, after two years of research and hard work, I had 10 beautiful images that I was proud of. I'd learned to work with a hairpin budget and a mid-level camera to create photos that could be printed on a grand scale. I saw potential in every face I came across; not a single person in these photos is a professional model, they were all my fellow students.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I would love to continue this project.  Whether or not any of the pre-Raphaelite perks are purchased, if this project is funded I intend to create more of these images and will update anyone who contributed to this campaign.</span></p>

NEW PERK: Photoshop tutoring!A Photographer Without a Camera is Like Mashed Potatoes Without GravyDo you want to live in a world with dry potatoes? I don't.Hi.I'm Alice Hanners.You've been invited here today for a single purpose: help me fill the void left by my stolen camera.I pinched pennies and saved to afford my gorgeous camera in my final year at University. I used it to photograph the images you see above (and below). My goal was to create large-scale prints that captured the beauty of pre-Raphaelite painters. (For more on this, scroll down to the almost-end!)That camera was good to me, and I have no doubt that it would have been with me for much longer.  But it was not to be. This past summer, my apartment was invaded by workers from the building, eager to ""renovate"". One wobbly toilet, three wall gouges, swapped hot-and-cold-water pipes and several broken lightbulbs later, I now have a ""renovated"" apartment--and no camera.I live in New York City, the most expensive city in the US, working as a photo editor. I'm lucky to have a job at all, with an arts degree, (it was between art school or an English degree, I decided to be practical), and I've gotten by via freelance projects on the side.I can't moonlight as a photographer if I don't have a camera. I can't shoot engagement photos, headshots, portraits, or my holiday card featuring my cats wearing adorable Christmas collars. You don't understand, they're so cute.If I can't shoot, I can't afford to replace my camera.That's where you come in.What I Need & What You GetI need a camera. Cameras can be bought at any price point, which is how I know that every penny of this campaign will go to good use. The goal is based on my dream camera, the Mark II (and a nice lens). I work a lot in low light and I've been dreaming of this camera for years. Importantly, the more this campaign raises, the nicer the camera/lenses I can buy, and as a result, the better my photos will be. This matters to you because you (yes, you!) can star in one of my photographs!  So, I need a camera--but you need things, too, and I want you to get something for your money.  There are many levels of perks. If you contribute even a single dollar, it brings me that much closer to my goal. Fans and contributors will be updated on EVERYTHING I do with my camera (well, maybe not everything).First up are my beautiful 5""x7"" postcards. 
These are designed to fit USPS regulations (you can actually mail them! in the mail! old school!) and feature a full-color, UV-protected reproduction of my pre-Raphaelite works. Buy 1 for $5 or 10 for $35, or--there are a whole bunch of packages. Check them out on the right.




Here are the images featured on the postcards!
Echo & Narcissus (modeled by Carolyn Bauch and Matthew Mazur):





Romeo & Juliet (modeled by Sanders Schneider and Jacqueline Jacob):





Rapunzel (modeled by Elena Zachary):






Cupid & Psyche (modeled by Ryan Thon and Kate Roberts):



Cinderella (modeled by Eden Palmer, with Hansen Donius as Prince Charming):




Red Riding Hood (modeled by Courtney Brown):






Pandora (modeled by Carolyn Bauch):






Ophelia (modeled by Alina Cepulis):





Prometheus (modeled by Nicholas Clark):






Persephone (modeled by Calista Merritt):






BUT WAIT! THERE'S MORE!
Next, we've got photoshoots! Whether you need a headshot, an engagement photo, a family portrait, or if you want to pose as Zeus hurling lightning from a cloud bank, all things are possible with perks!
Check out the options to your right. Don't see something you want? Feel free to contact me and let me know what you're thinking. By succeeding with this campaign, it means that I can take all kinds of photographs for all kind of people, reasons, and prices. 
Headshots include the basics. Hair/makeup not included, though I can (and will) touch you up as needed. I know nothing about styling men's hair. Don't even ask. Images will be retouched to your satisfaction (within reason). Bring any wardrobe changes you want. Whether you're updating your decade-old 8x10 or if it's your first time, I'll be gentle and understanding, and work with you at your own pace to get great photos.
You may notice that a milestone photo (engagement/wedding/family/pregnancy portrait, etc.) costs significantly more than a headshot. This perk is for when you want something just a much more special than a standard portrait. It will be personal, beautiful, and just what you want. I approach my portraits with the idea that they will be as beloved and treasured as, say, a painted family portrait, passed down through the generations.  While it will not be a production on the scale of a more elaborate pre-Raphaelite photo, these photos can include themes, sets, etc., within reason. Steampunk engagement photos! Dramatic, Vogue-esque new baby photos! (Is there such thing as an old baby?) This package is very unique in the fact that you will receive digital copies for reproducing these images (for your own personal use only--as wedding invitations, backup prints, etc.). This is your image for life!
Pre-Raphaelite photos are much more involved, both before and after the shoot. For these photos, I will work with you to provide and/or supplement wardrobe, props, and sets. The style, story, and location will be researched thoroughly prior to the shoot. Poses will be mapped out, storyboards drawn and locations perfected. The complexity of my initial photos increased with my experience, and I will continue that. An estimated 30-40 hours of retouching will go into each final photo. Creative decisions are ultimately my own--with this perk, I am pledging to deliver a stunning, beautiful photograph, so you're going to have to trust me. You will not receive a digital copy of the image(s), but you will have the opportunity to receive your print at whatever size you choose, up to 6', for only the additional material cost of printing.
""I want to purchase a photo perk but I can't do it before March 28th! Why are you discriminating against the date-challenged?!""
Hey, man, hey! Chill! Send me a message (contact user) and let's talk it out, yeah? I'm sure we can solve this challenge.

 NOW OFFERING PRINTS!
As requested, you can now purchase prints! Photos will be printed on velvety-soft, archival matte paper. Since my photos vary quite a bit in their dimensions, the title and blank paper will fill in for the odd sizes. Persephone, for example, will be exactly 11""x14"" and will not feature a title. Please contact me if you would like the image smaller and a title added!
For odd sizes, the image will appear similarly to this:






""Why Do YOU Deserve My Money?""Great question.
I could give you a sob story about how I need a camera to make money to pay for my cats' vet bills. I could not-so-subtly work it into my campaign text by saying ""I could give you a sob story about--""
Look, only you can decide if my cause is worth your money. So for my part, I'm trying to give you your money's worth; you have my gratitude if you contribute, but you deserve more than gratitude. You're helping me when I need it most, and I want to give back. The postcards are a way for me to do that on a smaller scale, while representing my work and giving you something you can use and admire. The other perks are things that I can give back, things that maybe you can't buy in a store. Who else would you turn to for a portrait of you and your six brothers as the seven dwarves? No, don't tell me, I hate competition.

""What Happens If You Don't Meet Your Goal?""

It sucks. But not for you. 
The cheapest decent DSLR on the market is about $500. If I make less than that, I will borrow/rent a camera to complete any photo perks that have been purchased. If I make more than that, I will buy the best camera & lenses that I can afford, and leftover will go toward accessories (memory cards, batteries) and future photography projects.

The exhibition, featuring images from Occupy Protests around the Midwest by photojournalist Kendall Brown, will include large scale portraits of protesters installed within the walls of the gallery as well as smaller-scale images wheat pasted through out Norman and the surrounding areas in the months leading up to the show's opening. In addition, the portraits and contextualizing images will be printed within their own broadsheet newspaper that will be available around Norman and at the show, providing further information about the movement.</span><br/><br/><span style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">The motivation behind the exhibition is to communicate both the collective and individual voices of the Occupy movement, both in protests taking place throughout the United States as well as happening around the world. Utilizing a photojournalism approach with a fine-art objective, Brown traveled to Occupy protest encampments throughout the heartland, collecting the images and stories of protesters in order to understand what their individual motivations were as well as the collective force that bound them together as a group.</span><br/><br/><span style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">For the project Brown was immersed in the protest, standing with the occupiers and camping alongside them in order to most fully document their, and her own, experiences.</span><br/><br/><span style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">Rather than presenting the protests in typical photojournalistic style, showing the protesters in their environment, Brown was inspired by the work of Avedon, choosing to intentionally remove the protesters from their surroundings to allow the viewer to see the protester for who they are as a human first. The resulting images are more fine art than photojournalism.

John Harlien didn't even flinch the second time Tulsa, Oklahoma police came for him with pepper spray canisters. As dozens of police and hired additional security assembled behind him in the dark recesses of the park, he calmly smeared Vaseline across his eyelids, down his cheeks and inside his nostrils. Another protester had told him the cream would help protect him from the burn of the spray when it almost certainly came. Two nights before, Harlien was one of nine Occupy Tulsa protesters pepper sprayed by Tulsa police while sitting peacefully on the ground, hands zip-tied behind them, propelling Oklahoma and the Occupy protests once again into the national spotlight. “What happened Tuesday night, with the pepper spray, well, it burned like none other,” Harlien said. “I couldn’t see anything, I had to be led to the paddy wagon. I could barely breathe, and I didn’t dare swallow or inhale through my nose. My face was a mess of drool and snot because anytime I tried to swallow or breathe through my nose, it just burned more.""Once he had been led to the police vehicle, Harlien said he was told he would be booked and allowed to wash the spray from his body and change clothes, but that never happened. In fact, he was held for 10 hours while the spray continued to burn his eyes and throat.""Once we got to booking, it was probably an hour or more before I could open even one eye,"" Harlien said. ""We were told when we were loaded in that once we got to booking, they’d give us something to help deal with the pepper spray. The whole 10 hours I was there, nothing was given to me. I went through a lot of pain, but the message was definitely worth it.”
The Impact
Snapshots of the American Autumn: A Portrait in Protesting is scheduled to premiere at MAINSITE Art Gallery in Norman, Oklahoma on June 9, 2012, and will be exhibited for two months. The exhibition, featuring images from Occupy Protests around the Midwest by photojournalist Kendall Brown, will include large scale portraits of protesters installed within the walls of the gallery as well as smaller-scale images wheat pasted through out Norman and the surrounding areas in the months leading up to the show's opening. In addition, the portraits and contextualizing images will be printed within their own broadsheet newspaper that will be available around Norman and at the show, providing further information about the movement.The motivation behind the exhibition is to communicate both the collective and individual voices of the Occupy movement, both in protests taking place throughout the United States as well as happening around the world. Utilizing a photojournalism approach with a fine-art objective, Brown traveled to Occupy protest encampments throughout the heartland, collecting the images and stories of protesters in order to understand what their individual motivations were as well as the collective force that bound them together as a group.For the project Brown was immersed in the protest, standing with the occupiers and camping alongside them in order to most fully document their, and her own, experiences.Rather than presenting the protests in typical photojournalistic style, showing the protesters in their environment, Brown was inspired by the work of Avedon, choosing to intentionally remove the protesters from their surroundings to allow the viewer to see the protester for who they are as a human first. The resulting images are more fine art than photojournalism. As the protests have continued, many times in the mainstream media protesters were intentionally framed within their surroundings to allow the stereotypes regarding the movement to be perpetuated. Brown's images seek to rectify this and foster a conversation that crosses party lines by confronting the viewer with images that abolish those stereotypes.
How the Funds Will be Used
All of the money raised will be used to assist with the cost of producing the show, including:- printing the floor-to-ceiling images to be hung inside of MAINSITE Art Gallery- design and printing of Occupy newspapers that will be available to show attendees, featuring further images and reading material to contextualize the portraits- printing and pasting of smaller-scale images throughout the area surrounding the gallery in the months leading up to the show premiere

As you can imagine, I did not come from wealthy means. My mom worked various dead-end jobs (like a saint) to raise me and my brother after a divorce that left with her with little to no money. And although I was brought up accustomed to not having much, I still allowed myself to dream big. <b>Cue photography.</b> </p><p>I fell in love with photography in high school when I was actually forced to take a photography elective to maintain credits. Little did I know it would impact me so much and change my entire life as I knew it. The Christmas following me taking the course, my mom bought me a Nikon point-and-shoot that I used constantly. Then as a Christmas/Graduation present when I was a senior in high school, my family surprised me with a DSLR which I also used to death (still do!) From there, I applied to some of the most renowned art schools in the country which landed me admission to Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York. <b>Cue debt!</b></p><p>Attending Pratt was extremely difficult, but I was adamant. I packed my things and moved from Pennsyltuckey (local nickname for PA) to ""the big city."" I had several family members co-sign loans for me so I was able to attend. However, it wasn't so clean-cut. Toward the end of my time at Pratt, I ran out of family members to pester for help and with tuition increasing year-after-year, I was starting to doubt I'd ever finish. In my last year of school, my Mom even borrowed against her 401k in order to supply me with money for my fall semester. After asking Pratt for help time and time again, one Pratt financial aid worker was kind enough to present my case to the board to secure funds (AKA: more federal loans, not a scholarship) to finish out my senior year and graduate. (Something I was very thankful for considering years previous, the only ""help"" I was given by the FinAid department was telling me to look over a scholarship packet that had scholarships that ended 5 years ago and/or did not apply to me due to race, not being a single-mother, etc.)</p><p>Now that I'm out of school, like a lot of graduates, I'm insanely in debt and having a terrifically bad time finding a job in my field! My student loans consume 85%+ of my paycheck making it near impossible to purchase a vehicle, move out, or even update some pieces of equipment to better my photography.  </p><p><br/></p><h2>So here's my proposal...</h2><p>I'm looking to raise a portion of my student loan debt to help alleviate the financial burden that going to school has put on not only me, but my family (who has been kind and supportive enough to help as much as they could by co-signing) and especially my Mom who has done<b><i> everything</i></b> in her power financially and mentally to see me go to and graduate from school. </p><p>In return, you will receive a giant thank you from me, plus...</p><p><br/></p><p><b>$10: </b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">A thank you on my website - so the entire internet can see how awesome you are (though we all know how awesome you are already!).</span></p><p><br/></p><p><b>$50: </b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">A signed 11x14 print of your choice of the five I have available here from my series 'Outland.'

In fact, that's what you'll find me doing the majority of the time when I'm not working in photoshop, etc. Mostly, I play MMOs (WoW, Aion, SWTOR, FF:ARR, Tera) but grew up playing any/all console games I could get my hands on and playing Quake Arena/Unreal Tournament. </p><p><br/></p><p><b>Quick! Favorite game!</b></p><p>A: All-time favorite: Metal Gear Solid. Snake? Snake? SNAAAAKKKE!</p><p><br/></p><p><b>Have video games affected your photography?</b></p><p>A: ABSOLUTELY! Sure, the proper phrase would be, ""I grew up playing video games"" but really it's more like, ""I grew up IN video games."" I played within worlds that you could only imagine and it has absolutely affected the way I create work.

As you can imagine, I did not come from wealthy means. My mom worked various dead-end jobs (like a saint) to raise me and my brother after a divorce that left with her with little to no money. And although I was brought up accustomed to not having much, I still allowed myself to dream big. Cue photography. I fell in love with photography in high school when I was actually forced to take a photography elective to maintain credits. Little did I know it would impact me so much and change my entire life as I knew it. The Christmas following me taking the course, my mom bought me a Nikon point-and-shoot that I used constantly. Then as a Christmas/Graduation present when I was a senior in high school, my family surprised me with a DSLR which I also used to death (still do!) From there, I applied to some of the most renowned art schools in the country which landed me admission to Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York. Cue debt!Attending Pratt was extremely difficult, but I was adamant. I packed my things and moved from Pennsyltuckey (local nickname for PA) to ""the big city."" I had several family members co-sign loans for me so I was able to attend. However, it wasn't so clean-cut. Toward the end of my time at Pratt, I ran out of family members to pester for help and with tuition increasing year-after-year, I was starting to doubt I'd ever finish. In my last year of school, my Mom even borrowed against her 401k in order to supply me with money for my fall semester. After asking Pratt for help time and time again, one Pratt financial aid worker was kind enough to present my case to the board to secure funds (AKA: more federal loans, not a scholarship) to finish out my senior year and graduate. (Something I was very thankful for considering years previous, the only ""help"" I was given by the FinAid department was telling me to look over a scholarship packet that had scholarships that ended 5 years ago and/or did not apply to me due to race, not being a single-mother, etc.)Now that I'm out of school, like a lot of graduates, I'm insanely in debt and having a terrifically bad time finding a job in my field! My student loans consume 85%+ of my paycheck making it near impossible to purchase a vehicle, move out, or even update some pieces of equipment to better my photography.  So here's my proposal...I'm looking to raise a portion of my student loan debt to help alleviate the financial burden that going to school has put on not only me, but my family (who has been kind and supportive enough to help as much as they could by co-signing) and especially my Mom who has done everything in her power financially and mentally to see me go to and graduate from school. In return, you will receive a giant thank you from me, plus...$10: A thank you on my website - so the entire internet can see how awesome you are (though we all know how awesome you are already!).$50: A signed 11x14 print of your choice of the five I have available here from my series 'Outland.' Make sure to pick the corresponding perk to the print you want! Printed on metallic kodak endura! (Of course, your name on my website as well!)$200: All five of the available 11x14 prints signed from my series 'Outland.' Printed on metallic kodak endura! (Of course, your name on my website as well!)Available prints! ----------------------------------------------------------If you're interested in seeing more of my work, feel free to visit www.nikkiphillipsphotography.com - and if you'd like to contact me, use that website's contact page to shoot me an e-mail!Thanks!Fun Facts:What else do you do besides photography?A: I am obsessed with video games. In fact, that's what you'll find me doing the majority of the time when I'm not working in photoshop, etc. Mostly, I play MMOs (WoW, Aion, SWTOR, FF:ARR, Tera) but grew up playing any/all console games I could get my hands on and playing Quake Arena/Unreal Tournament. Quick! Favorite game!A: All-time favorite: Metal Gear Solid. Snake? Snake? SNAAAAKKKE!Have video games affected your photography?A: ABSOLUTELY! Sure, the proper phrase would be, ""I grew up playing video games"" but really it's more like, ""I grew up IN video games."" I played within worlds that you could only imagine and it has absolutely affected the way I create work. Immersion is a common term for developers/players of video games which obviously speaks to how it feels to be within a particular world within a game. Immersion is exactly what I strive for within my photography.

</div></div>","About me
 
My name is david biene. I live in Berlin/ Germany and work as a freelance photographer. I did
a lot of music photography, portraits of creatives and fashion shootings. Lemmy
Kilmister, Mike Ness, T.C. Boyle and Josh Homme are only some I had the
pleasure to work with.
Aside of this I work on free
projects for exhibitions that got shown in Lebanon, Japan, Chile and Germany so
far. But the biggest of the projects I realized so far is HOPPED-UP. Itâ€™s my first fine art photography coffeetable book. And itâ€™s what all
this is about.
Iâ€™ve been into old motorcycles
and cars for ever. Even as a little boy I was fascinated by the forms and looks
and of course the sounds- and thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m still. Also looking at my music
favourites one could always find rockabilly and rhythmâ€™nâ€™blues with my records
of punkrock and that kind.
 
 
What â€˜Hopped-Upâ€™ is
about
 
In 2001 this suddenly all came
to live discovering that there was actually a lively scene for all this. And
even more: people actually built those cars by themselves and race them! There
were bands playin wild rockabilly and rhythmâ€™nâ€™blues themselves! It was simply
amazing.
I stepped into a small world of
adrenalin, gas and oil on the one hand and friendship, music and partying on
the other.
It felt like a counterpart to
todayâ€™s computerized life and thatâ€™s what fascinated me even more.
For me as a photographer it was
like a reflex action: I had to document this. It didnâ€™t take me long to decide
that I would like to make a book about this culture.
To show the realness of this
scene and the authenticity I decided to shoot this project entirely on film.
Also I determined thereâ€™d  be no staging and no retouching of any of the
photographs.
Every photo you see is the way I
found it along my way.
And this very way lead me to
several places all over Germany, Sweden, Finland, Norway, over in the UK,
Belgium and all the way down to Spain in the south. Iâ€™ve been to races,
Parties, barbecues and to peopleâ€™s homes and garages to take photos and do
interviews. 
From developping the concept and
starting to work on it in 2003 it took me over 5 years for travelling around
and collecting material. Another 1,5 years it took me to put it all together
and finally publish it in 2009.
For those 5 years I paid all the
expenses for traveling and film material from my own pocket and invested
massive amounts of my time to make this what I wanted to be my book like.
 
 
The book
 
With the help of the amazing
graphic designer (and since then good friend) Sascha Minde I put together
 240 pages of mainly black-and-white photography, an introductional text
written by me as well as 11 interviews all in English language. Printed on two
different kinds of paper the pages found themselves in a hard cover of 12 to 9
inch ( 30 x 22,5 cm ) 
To round up the whole experience
I wanted the ears of the spectator to get into it, too. So I recorded one
of the hot rod races and put it as a 1 hour soundsphere on a CD. A second CD
that I compiled from the great Rockabilly and Rhythm'n'Blues archives of Rhythm Bomb Records plays 13 rare songs. The first song even is exclusively written and
recorded by Berlin guitar legend Tex Morton for the book and is only available with it.
 
 
Great success and seeing
it let die
 
HOPPED-UP was released by a small publishing house situated in
Berlin Kreuzberg in June 2009.
Only 3,5 months later the first
print run of 1000 pieces was sold out.  My book was no longer available
though a lot of people were still asking for it.
While signing the contract it
was said weâ€™d start with 1000 copies having the option to print it again at any
time. And thatâ€™s what I expected and with me a lot of people as the
international interest for the book didnâ€™t die.
But: IT DIDNâ€™T
HAPPEN.  My book was a great success but they just let it die.
Fact is: that publishing house
will not release a 2nd print run of my book HOPPED-UP Iâ€™ve been working for
more than 5 years and still do.
I was pretty shocked. Then I
started looking for another way to get it out again.
In 2011 I found a new publisher
who is totally into the book and would love to get it out again. But for them
itâ€™s a risk as the book already was another publishing companyâ€™s product.
They need 10000 â‚¬ or 12500 USD
of the printing costs to be covered by me.
Thatâ€™s a great offer of a very
sympathic and high quality publisher.
But: I donâ€™t have 10000 â‚¬ or
12500 USD.
 
 
 
It's YOU who can bring
it back to life!
 
This is why I need you
out there! You lovers of photography! And lovers
of the ANALOGUE photography, of the true and the real! Lovers of the lively
niches of society and of youth cultures! You over there, enthusiasts of the
style of the American 1940s- 50s. You and you with your love for racing and
hopped-up engines on the track. And you with your dancing shoes loving the Jive
and the Blues Boppers.
Itâ€™s all in here. Hopped-Up is a
manifest for a passionate, lively and true scene made out of love and
fascination.
Please support me to bring
Hopped-Up to a second print run.

Where your money goes
and what youâ€™ll get for it
 
I think I put together some nice
Thank-you-gifts and packages for your funding. Check them out â€“ I hope you like
my stuff!
Your money is needed and will be
used for covering one half of the printing costs. The other half the new
publisherâ€™s goin to cover.
 
If we should not be able to
successfully fund this 10.000 â‚¬ or 12500 USD the book is not gonna get
reprinted anytime soon. It would be a very hard throwbag for me as the work of
all in all 7 years would have been for nothing. I really count on you people
and Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll like what you get as did the 900 buyers of the first print
run.
 
If there should even be more
money coming in I would be really grateful because thatâ€™d mean we would be able
to put the two CDs in the book again. Also I would try to still have two
different kinds of paper in your book, too, as it was in the first ones. So we
wouldnâ€™t be forced to only offer the sounds as a download link and shrink down
to just one paper kind.
 
Well and then Iâ€™m hoping and
planning to get some new exhibitions on. Money is needed and greatly
appreciated for this part of it too.

If for whatever reason we can't make it and do not reach the goal of course I'll send back the money you submitted. However, if you want to get your shirt or print anyways even if there's not enough funds to print the second print run of the book I'll make you these and send them out to you.
 
 
Your help on all
channels
 
But you can help much more and
beyond the financial part.
Iâ€™d love to see that you spread
the word about this book to your friends. If you become a fan of this Iâ€™m sure
there are friends around you who will love it to. Tell them!
And also Iâ€™d be very happy to
get your help on the exhibition issue. If you run a gallery or you know someone
who does please have close look!
Even if you live next to a
gallery that you love and where my work would fit in:  Iâ€™d be very happy
to get some clues on this from you, too!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>As a mammalian

breastfeed, provided they have the right information, family support and the
support of the health care system and society at large.</p>

<br/></div>","What’s all this about?
I
am Suzie Blake, a professional photographer and artist currently working in Melbourne,
Australia. I am also a mother of two boys, 3 year old Maximiliano and 8
month old Xavier. I am also a breastfeeding advocate.My
next big photography project is called ‘What Does Breastfeeding Look Like?’Self Portrait with Maximiliano and Xavier, 2015Why did I start this project?In the media, I feel there is a distinct lack of authenticity in images of women breastfeeding. Most photos are highly stylized, fetishistic or unrealistic; many
are sheer fantasy. Whether it is the angelic mother in her clinical white
perfection or some model on the front of a fashion magazine. I’m tired of
images that fail to show the realities of breastfeeding for most women.
This
project is about portraying breastfeeding in all its beautiful messiness. This
is about tired eyes and no make up. This is about milk leaks and ratty hair.
This is about giving in to all the demands of your 2 year old while you try to
feed your newborn. This is about dishes pilled up in the kitchen and dirty laundry
building in the corner. This is about puke on your shoulder and toys on the
floor. This is about let down milk sprays in cafes and engorged breasts at the
park.-----This is about empowering women.This is about the amazing thing that only we, the women humans of this earth, can do; sustain another humans life with our own.-----I have been documenting the project here. Nat, 2015Lena, 2015What's so important about breastfeeding?
The WHO
recommends ‘breastfeeding up to 6 months of age, with continued breastfeeding
along with appropriate complementary foods up to two years of age or beyond.’ 
As a mammalian
species the normal way of providing our young with the nutrients they need for
healthy growth and development is through breastfeeding. Most mothers can
breastfeed, provided they have the right information, family support and the
support of the health care system and society at large.
In spite of the
WHO recommendations and scientific research, women are faced with innumerable
challenges, both in the west and the developing world. 
- 
It is estimated that improved breastfeeding practices
could save some 1.5 million children a year. Yet few of the 129 million babies
born each year receive optimal breastfeeding and some are not breastfed at all.
Early cessation of breastfeeding in favour of commercial breastmilk
substitutes, needless supplementation, and poorly timed complementary practices
are still too common. Professional and commercial influences combine to
discourage breastfeeding, as do continued gaps in maternity legislation.[1]
- 
Formula-fed infants are at higher risk for ingestion of
lead, aluminum, and other heavy metals as well as iodine[2]
- 
The use of infant formula from birth doubles the risk
of infant death for American babies[3]
- 
If every child was breastfed within an hour of birth,
given only breast milk for their first six months of life, and continued
breastfeeding up to the age of two years, about 800 000 child lives would be
saved every year[4]-----



I believe it is a human right for all people to be breastfed. Mothers should not have to face additional challenges in their attempts to breastfeed their young; simply learning the art of breastfeeding is challenge enough.-----Marta, 2015Kimberley, 2015What I need?I need an initial amount of USD$4000 to take the project to the UK.
Why the UK? Europe has the lowest breastfeeding rates in the world, and within Europe the
UK has among the lowest breastfeeding rates. This is an alarming statistic,
especially in light of the fact that the UK has comparatively good paid

hire and petrol. I will shoot breastfeeding mothers all over the country and
already have several lined up!
I
will be documenting the mothers I encounter on this trip on the blog, and will also include stories of these women. Sheri, 2015

<br/>The two constant passions in my life are curiosity about the world, and <b>water</b>. I am a sailor, a SCUBA diver, a lawyer and a photographer.<br/><br/><b>BRIEF SUMMARY:</b><br/>This project is about funding equipment to photograph these remarkable animals. Manta Rays are glamourous and magical creatures, sleak underwater flying machines. I intend to capture not only images of them, but of the ocean and the Great Barrier Reef itself.  I offer two things in return: an 17 x 22 print from my expedition AND a photograph from my existing, land-based collection (click the GALLERY tab near the top of the page - under the headline word REEF). PLUS, during the expedition, I will be sending an email update to every contributor. These will be notes from the field and will including snapshots and stories of life on the reef.<br/><br/><b>WHERE AND WHEN</b>?<br/>A not-for-profit research team works off the east coast of Australia documenting the Mantas as they feed and migrate. I will join this project for one week and continue to dive on the Great Barrier Reef at the conclusion of the project through a local diving club. The hosted part of the trip is operated through the reputable and respected organization, Earthwatch; the program is designed to watch and study Manta Rays. <br/><br/>I will seek to join the next possible dates following the campaign closure in the end of September. I am hoping for a November 2014 start date.<br/> <br/><b>WHY?</b><br/>I am fascinated by water and by flight. Manta Rays capture both and many iconic underwater images focus on these animals.<br/><br/><b>HOW?</b><br/>This project exists to fund the purchase of underwater equipment ($5,100) and expedition cost ($3,600). These figures include the money necessary to produce the perks that are rewards for contributors.<br/><br/><b>IS THERE SOMETHING UNIQUE HERE?<br/></b>Yes. The prints will be produced on Shawn's high-end photo printer by Shawn himself so that he can control the color and the print quality. The end result will be that you helped participate in an underwater adventure and you'll have the proof in your own home to prove it. Much the way patrons of the arts or funders of expeditions have their trophies.<br/><br/><b>WHAT STANDS IN THE WAY?</b><br/>My body of work today is land-based. The water images I do have are taken from docks, rafts and the shore. I want to get underwater, to capture images of water underwater and on-water. This project began with a keen desire to focus on water and has emerged with my growing interest in rays.<br/><br/><b>WHAT EXPERIENCE DO YOU HAVE AS A PHOTOGRAPHER?</b><br/>I was the official photographer for a winter snow festival in Ottawa in the winter of 2014. This was a multi-day event taking indoor photos both portraits and candids.  <br/><br/>In September 2014, four of my images from other work are being hung at Jak's Kitchen, an upscale bistro in Ottawa. (Contributors are invited to join us for my opening).<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/774943/files/20140808121418-2_Jaks.jpg?1407525258"" src="""" style=""width: 617.902px; height: 349px;""/></p>

<p>I will pay from my own money for the airfare to Australia. So - your contributions pay for equipment, I pay for the travel. <br/></p>
<br/><h3>Perks? <i>Yes, you get perks!</i>
</h3>
<p>As a thank you for participating in this project, you will receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>a frameable print from the Manta Ray expedition, printed and signed by me (various sizes of prints)<br/>

<p><b>RISK: What if the project is not fully funded?</b></p>
<p>If I do not reach my financial goal, then backers will receive an additional print from the existing land-based collection in place of the print/gift from the Manta Ray expedition. This would be highly disappointing, of course, and underlines why your assistance is needed!<br/></p>
<b>Questions and Answers:</b>
<p>Q:  I don't see a place to choose the photo I want!</p>
<p>A:  When the campaign ends, I will contact you and you let me know then which photo you want. If you haven't heard from me within a week of the campaign closing date, then email me: shawn@shawnpudsey.ca <br/></p>Q:  What risk is there?
<br/>A:  The expedition relies on my ability to join the Earthwatch group, subject to their space availability. Without an available space, I will need to wait until the next opening.  This may delay the delivery of the Manta Ray prints. I may also be hit by lightning and swallowed by a shark, in which case all bets are off.<br/><br/>Q:  When will we receive the perks?<br/>A:  The print from the existing collection will be to you before December 15th, just in time for the holidays - or for Christmas giving. While I will attempt to do the same for the Manta Ray print, this is subject to the space availability before November of <br/>a place on the Earthwatch expedition.<br/><br/>Q: What about sizes? Not all photos are exactly 8 x 10 or 11 x 14 or 17 x 22?
<p>A: Very true. All photos will be close if not exactly each of those sizes.  There are some photos that are odd sizes. If precise size is important to you, please raise this issue when I get in touch with you.</p>
<h1>The SMALL PRINT<br/>
</h1>
<p>Q:  Can I get anything framed?</p>
<p>A:  Framing is highly personal. If you want me to do it, then please contact me: shawn@shawnpudsey.ca. <br/></p>
<p>Q:  The small print doesn't say x, y or z. So ... pay me!</p>
<p>A:   At all times, this proposal is subject to reasonable expectations. I want you to be happy with the print. If it arrives damaged, I'll replace it. If you hate it when you see it, contact me. Let's see what we can work out. <br/></p>

Q:  The small print doesn't say x, y or z. So ... pay me!
A:   At all times, this proposal is subject to reasonable expectations. I want you to be happy with the print. If it arrives damaged, I'll replace it. If you hate it when you see it, contact me. Let's see what we can work out.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h4><b>$10 Donations</b></h4>
</div>
<div>
<p>For those who can donate at the $10 level I will be sending out postcards by mail featuring an image of mine (an implied nude to make it post office safe) with a personal thank you message from me.</p>
<h4><b>$30 Donations</b></h4>
<p>Thirty dollar donations will receive an inkjet print signed and dated by me. I make my inkjet prints with archival inks on matte surface paper. The print will measure 8 inches by 12 inches and will come to you packed in a sturdy tube via the US Postal Service.</p>
<h4><b>$55 Donations</b></h4>
<p>Now here is where things get interesting!! I am prepared to send out an 8 x 10 Silver Gelatin Print of an image I have never published or exhibited anywhere in the public eye. Basically, I will be doing a photo shoot at the end of this campaign and the results will be going directly to my donators. These aren't images I've been keeping in a back drawer because I didn't like them. I will never publish the image on Tumblr, Facebook, my website, Twitter, Instagram, etc. It will be for your eyes alone!</p>
<p>What I can say now about the image is that it will be a nude, or a nude portrait, and will be made on old school black and white film. All prints will be signed and dated on the back and made in a traditional wet darkroom on Silver Gelatin Paper. No two wet darkroom prints are quite the same so this is a truly unique item at a rock bottom price. </p>
<p>Silver Gelatin Prints look great when matted and framed or they are just as nice stored away in a private art collection.</p>
<h4><b>$100 Donations</b></h4>
<p>Same as the $55 incentive level but a larger print size of 11 x 14. Personally, this is my favorite size to make prints. Large enough to make a presence when put on a wall but not so large that they take over the space. When doing gallery shows, I always prefer to print at 11 x 14. </p>
<h4><b>$275 Donations</b></h4>
Not one, not two, but five... yes... <b>FIVE</b> exclusive 8 x 10 Silver Gelatin Prints featuring images I will never publish or display on the internet or in a gallery.

Pakete zu bestellen, anstatt einen Geldbetrag einzugeben. Sonst fehlt nämlich Eure Adresse und ich weiß nicht wohin mit dem Buch!<br/> </p><p><strong>Worum geht’s</strong><br/>Jeder Fotograf hat seine Geschichte zu erzählen. Meine beginnt sehr einfach. Unzufrieden und gelangweilt von alle den Bildern, die ich ausschließlich digital geschossen hatte, ließ mich der Gedanke nicht los, dass sich irgendetwas ändern musste. Irgendwas fehlte mir einfach in meinen Bildern. Wer hätte gedacht, dass die Lösung des Problems so einfach um die Ecke kommt. Kurz vor Weihnachten 2015 schenkte mir mein Schwiegervater seine alte Pentax ME Super Kamera mit ein paar Objektiven, die er beim aufräumen auf dem Dachboden gefunden hatte und so fing ich an mich mit der anaolgen Kamera zu beschäftigen. Fast zeitgleich hatte ich beim Aufräumen und Stöbern im Keller alte Familienbilder und VHS Kassetten gefunden. Fotos wie ich stolz meine erste Polaroid Kamera in den Händen halte, wie ich strahlend auf meinem neuen BMX saß oder als ich mit meiner Pepsi im Sommer vor dem Laden von meinem Vater stand, und noch viele weitere schöne Erinnerungen. Als ich dann noch die alten VHS Kassetten in meinen verstaubten Videorekorder steckte, war es plötzlich so offensichtlich. Die Kameras, Filme wie “Airborne” oder Serien wie “Baywatch” auf meinen alten VHS Kassetten - ich musste mal eine kleine Zeitreise machen. Es überkam mich sofort dieses Gefühl von früher als die Fotografie für mich als Kind so einfach und unkompliziert war - einfach auf den kleinen Knopf drücken und dann das ungeduldige Warten bis die Bilder entwickelt wurden. Es war sofort um mich geschehen! Im Januar 2016 habe ich dann euphorisch und recht planlos mit einer Hand voller Filme angefangen und ich bin so unbeschreiblich glücklich darüber wie es sich entwickelt hat. Es liegt ein absolut verrücktes Jahr hinter mir, mit so vielen wundervollen Menschen, die mich dabei begleitet haben. Und ich bin Jedem einzelnen, der bei meinen Blödsinn bisher mitgemacht hat, so dankbar. Ach was freue ich mich darauf wenn ich später alt und faltig bin meinen Kiddies davon erzählen zu können!<br/> </p><p><strong>Was ist eigentlich “Suburban Neverland”?</strong><br/>Es sind schlicht gesagt Schnappschüsse aus einer Zeit die so magisch und wundervoll ist, wie keine Andere. Suburban Neverland erzählt eine Geschichte, die eigentlich schon seit vielen Jahren in meinem Kopf steckte und nur darauf gewartet hat endlich von Leuten gesehen zu werden. Das Gefühl von Unbeschwertheit, heißen Sommertagen, einer eiskalten Pepsi und die Schmetterlinge im Bauch, wenn du das Mädchen von Nebenan auf der Straße entdeckt hast. Übrigens, viele unveröffentlichte Aufnahmen sind ebenfalls im Buch enthalten.<br/> </p><p><strong>Ich will ein Buch veröffentlichen</strong><br/>Ganz einfach. Ich habe da diesen kleinen Traum von einem Fotobuch, in dem all diese Erinnerungen und Emotionen stecken. Um diesen Traum zu realisieren und mein Buch produzieren zu können, brauche ich euch! Mit jedem Kauf eines Exemplares rückt die Erfüllung meines Traumes ein kleines Stück näher. Je mehr Geld zusammen kommt, desto schicker und exklusiver kann ich mein Herzensprojekt für euch gestalten. Es bedeutet mir sehr viel, dass ihr die Möglichkeit bekommt meine Bilder gedruckt an zu schauen und nicht einfach nur lieblos auf irgendwelchen Online Portfolios oder Social Media in mieser Qualität. Weg von dem ganzen Onlinewahn hin zu Papier in der Hand! Ich möchte das ihr es durchblättert und dieses Gefühl vergangener Tage mit mir teilt. Dass ihr euch das Buch anschaut und den Drang verspürt, alte Bilder aus eurer Jugend oder von euren Eltern aus dem Keller zu kramen, auf dem nächsten Flohmarkt einen VHS Recorder oder eine alte Knipse, die vielleicht noch funktioniert, zu kaufen. Zum Einstimmen habe ich für Euch auch noch die passende Playlist auf <strong><a href=""https://open.spotify.com/user/thisisdavidanthony/playlist/5Au50y1RzFVuElZqlgqu2X"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Spotify</a></strong> erstellt.<br/> </p><p><strong>Hier noch ein paar Details zum Buch</strong></p><p>• Format 210x270 mm<br/>• Softcover<br/>• ca. 200 -220 Seiten<br/>• Premium Offset Papier<br/>• Paperback<br/>• Texte auf Englisch<br/> </p><p><strong>Wie ihr mir helfen könnt?</strong><br/>Das ist eigentlich recht einfach. Ich benötige genau 6.800 Euro um die wichtigsten Kosten zu decken. Okay, eigentlich brauche ich etwas mehr als 6.800 Euro aber damit sind erstmal die Hauptkosten gedeckt. Den Rest bekomme ich hin. Ich will so sehr, dass es Realität wird und ich und vorallem ihr mein Buch in der Hand halten könnt. Wie das immer so ist, kommen noch Steuern dazu und dann wollen PayPal und Indiegogo auch noch ein bisschen was haben. Verpackung und Versand sind aber bereits im Preis der Perks bzw.

Im Anschluss werden wir auf technische Aspekte unser beider Fotografie eingehen. Dabei geht es nicht um Kameras und Technik, sondern vor allem um das Sehen, Identifizieren und die Nutzung von natürlichem und Umgebungslicht. Wir halten die Gruppe an diesem Tag absichtlich klein, da wir intensiv auf jeden Teilnehmer eingehen möchten. Ein extrem lächerliches Hawaii-Hemd, Pizza, Bier und Rum sind inklusive. Wer länger anreisen muss oder eventuell des Autofahrens nicht mehr mächtig sein wird, bringt nen Schlafsack mit und darf gern mit uns bei Bob übernachten.

Ich will es mal so sagen. Ich kann das Buch nicht einfach so selber produzieren bzw. komplett selbst finanzieren. Wenn nicht zumindest die Druckkosten inkl.

Otherwise your address is missing and I don´t know where I should send your book to.<br/> </p><p><strong>What it's all about</strong><br/>Every photographer has his own story to tell. My story starts very simple. I was unsatisfied and bored of all the pictures I had made with my DSLR and more frequently I thougt that something had to change in the way taking pictures. There was just something missing in my pictures but I didn't knew what. Who would have thought that the solution of this problem would be so easy. My father in law gave me his old Pentax ME Super camera from the attic. And so I started to deal with it - the analogue camera and film. Almost at the same time I found some old family pictures and videocassettes while cleaning up the cellar. Photos on which I proudly hold my first Polaroid camera in my hands, where I sat on my new BMX bike with pure happiness on my face or one where I stood in front of my dad´s old grocery store with a cold Pepsi in my hand on a hot summer day, and many more beautiful memories. When I started watching the old VHS tapes on my dusty videorecorder it was just so obviously for me. The camera, films like ""Airborne"" or my favorite series like ""Baywatch"" on my old VHS tapes - I had to do a journey back in time. The feeling of the past just overtook me. How simple it was for me taking pictures as a child. Photography was so uncomplicated, simple and fun – you just had to push the small button, that's it. I will never forget this feeling while waiting for the pictures to be developed. It was all up with my mind! In January 2016 I started really euphorically and without any plan just with a handful of films and my analogue camera. Now I'm so happy how this all comes so far. This was an absolutely crazy year with so many wonderful people I met on this journey. And I'm so thankful for every single person who had taken part in my weird ideas so far. Oh my, I can not wait to be old and wrinkled telling my kids about that crazy trip.<br/> </p><p><strong>What the hell is Suburban Neverland?</strong><br/>Very simple, it's just snapshots from the most magical and wonderful time I can remember. Suburban Neverland tells a story that has been in my head for many years and just waited for people to be seen an hopefully now printed on paper. The feeling of easiness, hot summers, ice cold Pepsi and butterflies dancing in the belly, when you've seen the girl next door on the street. oh, and be sure a lot of unpublished shots will be included in the book.<br/> </p><p><strong>I want to publish a book</strong><br/>I have this little dream of a book that contains all these snapshots, memories and emotions. To realize this dream and to be able to produce my book, I need you! With the purchase or let's better say the pre-order, the realization of my dream is a little step closer. The more money comes together, the better I can design and produce the book for you. It means so much to me that you get the chance to look at my pictures printed and not just swipe online in bad quality. I wanna jump off from the whole online madness into paper in your hands! I want you to flick through it and share this feeling of the good old days with me. I want you to look at the snapshots and feel the need to browse trough old pictures from your youth or from your parents, to go to the next flea market and buy an dusty videorecorder or an old camera. To get you in the right mood for it I have created an playlist on <strong><a href=""https://open.spotify.com/user/thisisdavidanthony/playlist/5Au50y1RzFVuElZqlgqu2X"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Spotify </a></strong>especially for you.<br/> </p><p><strong>Book details</strong></p><p>• Format 210x270 mm<br/>• Softcover<br/>• 200 -220 pages<br/>• Premium offset paper<br/>• Paperback<br/>• English texts<br/> </p><p><strong>How can you help me?</strong><br/>This is actually quite simple. I need exactly 6.800 euros to break even the most important costs. Okay, actually I need a little bit more than 6.800 euros, but with this amount nearly the main costs are covered and I will manage the rest of it. I want this so badly, to hold my own book in my hands - I want you to hold my book in your hands. I hope we can make it happen. As you know, there are still some taxes to pay, and then PayPal and Indiegogo want also a piece of the pie. Packaging and shipping are already included in the price of the perks. There are some really cool perks and I hope you will like them. If I don't get the amount of 6.800€, by the way what I really don't hope that this will happen, you will automatically get your money back!<br/> </p><p><strong>Publications in magazines</strong><br/>Here you can find some photo series of the past year to give you an quick insight into my work and to get to know me as a person a little bit better. So head over and have a look. To get you into the right mood for the book, <strong><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/thisisdavidanthony/videos/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HERE</a></strong> are some more videos that will be also included as a 10-15 minutes cut version on original FUJI VHS in one of my perks.

Pakete zu bestellen, anstatt einen Geldbetrag einzugeben. Sonst fehlt nämlich Eure Adresse und ich weiß nicht wohin mit dem Buch! Worum geht’sJeder Fotograf hat seine Geschichte zu erzählen. Meine beginnt sehr einfach. Unzufrieden und gelangweilt von alle den Bildern, die ich ausschließlich digital geschossen hatte, ließ mich der Gedanke nicht los, dass sich irgendetwas ändern musste. Irgendwas fehlte mir einfach in meinen Bildern. Wer hätte gedacht, dass die Lösung des Problems so einfach um die Ecke kommt. Kurz vor Weihnachten 2015 schenkte mir mein Schwiegervater seine alte Pentax ME Super Kamera mit ein paar Objektiven, die er beim aufräumen auf dem Dachboden gefunden hatte und so fing ich an mich mit der anaolgen Kamera zu beschäftigen. Fast zeitgleich hatte ich beim Aufräumen und Stöbern im Keller alte Familienbilder und VHS Kassetten gefunden. Fotos wie ich stolz meine erste Polaroid Kamera in den Händen halte, wie ich strahlend auf meinem neuen BMX saß oder als ich mit meiner Pepsi im Sommer vor dem Laden von meinem Vater stand, und noch viele weitere schöne Erinnerungen. Als ich dann noch die alten VHS Kassetten in meinen verstaubten Videorekorder steckte, war es plötzlich so offensichtlich. Die Kameras, Filme wie “Airborne” oder Serien wie “Baywatch” auf meinen alten VHS Kassetten - ich musste mal eine kleine Zeitreise machen. Es überkam mich sofort dieses Gefühl von früher als die Fotografie für mich als Kind so einfach und unkompliziert war - einfach auf den kleinen Knopf drücken und dann das ungeduldige Warten bis die Bilder entwickelt wurden. Es war sofort um mich geschehen! Im Januar 2016 habe ich dann euphorisch und recht planlos mit einer Hand voller Filme angefangen und ich bin so unbeschreiblich glücklich darüber wie es sich entwickelt hat. Es liegt ein absolut verrücktes Jahr hinter mir, mit so vielen wundervollen Menschen, die mich dabei begleitet haben. Und ich bin Jedem einzelnen, der bei meinen Blödsinn bisher mitgemacht hat, so dankbar. Ach was freue ich mich darauf wenn ich später alt und faltig bin meinen Kiddies davon erzählen zu können! Was ist eigentlich “Suburban Neverland”?Es sind schlicht gesagt Schnappschüsse aus einer Zeit die so magisch und wundervoll ist, wie keine Andere. Suburban Neverland erzählt eine Geschichte, die eigentlich schon seit vielen Jahren in meinem Kopf steckte und nur darauf gewartet hat endlich von Leuten gesehen zu werden. Das Gefühl von Unbeschwertheit, heißen Sommertagen, einer eiskalten Pepsi und die Schmetterlinge im Bauch, wenn du das Mädchen von Nebenan auf der Straße entdeckt hast. Übrigens, viele unveröffentlichte Aufnahmen sind ebenfalls im Buch enthalten. Ich will ein Buch veröffentlichenGanz einfach. Ich habe da diesen kleinen Traum von einem Fotobuch, in dem all diese Erinnerungen und Emotionen stecken. Um diesen Traum zu realisieren und mein Buch produzieren zu können, brauche ich euch! Mit jedem Kauf eines Exemplares rückt die Erfüllung meines Traumes ein kleines Stück näher. Je mehr Geld zusammen kommt, desto schicker und exklusiver kann ich mein Herzensprojekt für euch gestalten. Es bedeutet mir sehr viel, dass ihr die Möglichkeit bekommt meine Bilder gedruckt an zu schauen und nicht einfach nur lieblos auf irgendwelchen Online Portfolios oder Social Media in mieser Qualität. Weg von dem ganzen Onlinewahn hin zu Papier in der Hand! Ich möchte das ihr es durchblättert und dieses Gefühl vergangener Tage mit mir teilt. Dass ihr euch das Buch anschaut und den Drang verspürt, alte Bilder aus eurer Jugend oder von euren Eltern aus dem Keller zu kramen, auf dem nächsten Flohmarkt einen VHS Recorder oder eine alte Knipse, die vielleicht noch funktioniert, zu kaufen. Zum Einstimmen habe ich für Euch auch noch die passende Playlist auf Spotify erstellt. Hier noch ein paar Details zum Buch• Format 210x270 mm• Softcover• ca. 200 -220 Seiten• Premium Offset Papier• Paperback• Texte auf Englisch Wie ihr mir helfen könnt?Das ist eigentlich recht einfach. Ich benötige genau 6.800 Euro um die wichtigsten Kosten zu decken. Okay, eigentlich brauche ich etwas mehr als 6.800 Euro aber damit sind erstmal die Hauptkosten gedeckt. Den Rest bekomme ich hin. Ich will so sehr, dass es Realität wird und ich und vorallem ihr mein Buch in der Hand halten könnt. Wie das immer so ist, kommen noch Steuern dazu und dann wollen PayPal und Indiegogo auch noch ein bisschen was haben. Verpackung und Versand sind aber bereits im Preis der Perks bzw. Pakete enthalten. Ich habe mir für euch ein paar schicke Perks ausgedacht, die Euch hoffentlich gefallen werden. Sollte ich warum auch immer die angestrebten 6.800 Euro nicht erreichen, was ich natürlich nicht hoffe, bekommen alle automatisch ihr Geld zurück und es war eine fette Ente! Please not!!!! Wie wird das Buch denn aussehen? Hier sind noch ein paar weitere BeispielbilderWie werden die Goodies in den Perks aussehen?Hier ist eine kleine Preview der Goodies made by Neil Productions

Ich arbeite als Mediengestalter und Fotograf. Möglicherweise habt ihr schon ein paar Bilder von mir online gesehen, wenn nicht dann mal hop hop den Link unten folgen. Ich bin durch Zufall in die Produkt- und Werbefotografie gerutscht und habe u.a. Lookbooks für verschiedene Unternehmen geshootet. Jetzt habe ich endlich das gefunden, wo mein Herz dranhängt. Analog. Amerika. 80er. 90er. Wie lange muss man warten bzw. wann kommt das Buch?Also der Plan sieht folgendermaßen aus. Wenn alles klappt und wir das Geld zusammen bekommen, wird es ab Februar ernst.• Mitte Januar werde ich die letzen Bilder anpassen und bearbeiten• Anschließend schreibe ich noch ein paar kleine Geschichten• Und dann werde ich das Buch layouten• Ab Ende Januar werde ich das Merchandise produzieren• Mitte / Ende Februar geht das Buch in den Druck• Mitte März ist dann der offizielle Release von “Suburban Neverland”• Und dann sollten es alle Supporter pünktlich im Briefkasten haben! Warum soll ich jetzt schon bestellen und nicht bis zum Release warten?Also. Ich will es mal so sagen. Ich kann das Buch nicht einfach so selber produzieren bzw. komplett selbst finanzieren. Wenn nicht zumindest die Druckkosten inkl. Verpackung und Versand hier per Vorbestellung reinkommen, kommt das Buch leider erst gar nicht zu Stande. Wäre doch schade, oder? Ach und die Pakete bzw. Perks gibt es nur hier. First come, first get. Du bist so Broke wie ich und hast eigentlich keine Lust auf das Buch.All good. Wie wäre es, wenn du mich einfach ein wenig supportest und diese Kampagne teilst. Egal ob online oder ob du deinen Freunden und Bekannten davon erzählst und so dieses Projekt ebenfalls realisierbar machst. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat or whatever. Dafür kannst du auch die Tools von Indiegogo weiter unten nutzen. Du würdest mir eine riesen Freude machen und ich wäre dir ewig dankbar, dass du ein Teil von meinem Herzensprojekt bist! Let’s make it happenIch würde mich über eure Unterstützung sehr freuen und ihr würdet mir helfen einen Traum zu verwirklichen, den ich auch noch mit euch teilen kann - Here we go! Danke für Euren Support, Eure Zeit und Eure Hilfe. Wenn es irgendwelche Fragen gibt, ich stehe euch per Mail unter indiegogo@david-anthony.com und auf Facebbok jederzeit Rede und Antwort.www.david-anthony.comwww.instagram.com/thisisdavidanthonywww.facebook.com/thisisdavidanthonywww.thisisdavidanthony.tumblr.comCheers,   AttentionPlease make sure to order one of the perks or packages instead of paying an amount of money. Otherwise your address is missing and I don´t know where I should send your book to. What it's all aboutEvery photographer has his own story to tell. My story starts very simple. I was unsatisfied and bored of all the pictures I had made with my DSLR and more frequently I thougt that something had to change in the way taking pictures. There was just something missing in my pictures but I didn't knew what. Who would have thought that the solution of this problem would be so easy. My father in law gave me his old Pentax ME Super camera from the attic. And so I started to deal with it - the analogue camera and film. Almost at the same time I found some old family pictures and videocassettes while cleaning up the cellar. Photos on which I proudly hold my first Polaroid camera in my hands, where I sat on my new BMX bike with pure happiness on my face or one where I stood in front of my dad´s old grocery store with a cold Pepsi in my hand on a hot summer day, and many more beautiful memories. When I started watching the old VHS tapes on my dusty videorecorder it was just so obviously for me. The camera, films like ""Airborne"" or my favorite series like ""Baywatch"" on my old VHS tapes - I had to do a journey back in time. The feeling of the past just overtook me. How simple it was for me taking pictures as a child. Photography was so uncomplicated, simple and fun – you just had to push the small button, that's it. I will never forget this feeling while waiting for the pictures to be developed. It was all up with my mind! In January 2016 I started really euphorically and without any plan just with a handful of films and my analogue camera. Now I'm so happy how this all comes so far. This was an absolutely crazy year with so many wonderful people I met on this journey. And I'm so thankful for every single person who had taken part in my weird ideas so far. Oh my, I can not wait to be old and wrinkled telling my kids about that crazy trip. What the hell is Suburban Neverland?Very simple, it's just snapshots from the most magical and wonderful time I can remember. Suburban Neverland tells a story that has been in my head for many years and just waited for people to be seen an hopefully now printed on paper. The feeling of easiness, hot summers, ice cold Pepsi and butterflies dancing in the belly, when you've seen the girl next door on the street. oh, and be sure a lot of unpublished shots will be included in the book. I want to publish a bookI have this little dream of a book that contains all these snapshots, memories and emotions. To realize this dream and to be able to produce my book, I need you! With the purchase or let's better say the pre-order, the realization of my dream is a little step closer. The more money comes together, the better I can design and produce the book for you. It means so much to me that you get the chance to look at my pictures printed and not just swipe online in bad quality. I wanna jump off from the whole online madness into paper in your hands! I want you to flick through it and share this feeling of the good old days with me. I want you to look at the snapshots and feel the need to browse trough old pictures from your youth or from your parents, to go to the next flea market and buy an dusty videorecorder or an old camera. To get you in the right mood for it I have created an playlist on Spotify especially for you. Book details• Format 210x270 mm• Softcover• 200 -220 pages• Premium offset paper• Paperback• English texts How can you help me?This is actually quite simple. I need exactly 6.800 euros to break even the most important costs. Okay, actually I need a little bit more than 6.800 euros, but with this amount nearly the main costs are covered and I will manage the rest of it. I want this so badly, to hold my own book in my hands - I want you to hold my book in your hands. I hope we can make it happen. As you know, there are still some taxes to pay, and then PayPal and Indiegogo want also a piece of the pie. Packaging and shipping are already included in the price of the perks. There are some really cool perks and I hope you will like them. If I don't get the amount of 6.800€, by the way what I really don't hope that this will happen, you will automatically get your money back! Publications in magazinesHere you can find some photo series of the past year to give you an quick insight into my work and to get to know me as a person a little bit better. So head over and have a look. To get you into the right mood for the book, HERE are some more videos that will be also included as a 10-15 minutes cut version on original FUJI VHS in one of my perks. I believe together with you guys this is going to be nuts!Rekt Magazine - Valeska CurierFlake Magazine  - Kathy & FranziAirMag Magazine - Elena MpouraB-Authentique - Antonia Flach Apple Pie Magazine - Marie & AlinaLiebe Nachbarn - The American DreamNice, but who is this guy named Dave?Hey Kids, that's me. I work as a media designer, filmcutter and photographer. Maybe you have already seen some of my works online, if not just use the link below. By a happy coincidence I slid into the product and advertising photography and worked for companies like WuTang Brand, for which I designed cloth and shoot the lookbook. Now I've finally found what I really love to do. Analogue. America. 80s. 90s. How long will it takes or how long do I have to wait for the book?The plan is simple. If everything goes well and I reach the amount of 6.800 euros, it will be going serious from February on.• In the middle of January I will adapt and edit the last pictures• Afterwards I'll write a few small stories and then layout the book• From the end of January, I will produce the merchandise.• In the middle / end of February, the book goes straight into print• In middle of March you should have the book in your mailbox! Why should I order the book now and not when it is released?I cannot produce or finance the book completely on my own. If not at least the printing costs incl. packaging and shipping costs are covered by pre-orders it is not possible for me to produce it. Would be a pity, right? Oh and you will only get the packages / perks here. First come, first get. If you're as broke as I am and not really liking a book.All good. So just show some love for my project and support me by sharing my campaign. Whether you share it online or if you just tell your friends about it, it means a lot to me and it will help to realize my project. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat or whatever. You can also use the tools of Indiegogo below. That would be awesome! I would be so happy about your support. So please help me to realize this dream that I can share with you! Thank you for your support, your time and your help. If there are any questions, please do not hesitate to ask me: indiegogo@david-anthony.com and of course on Facebook.www.david-anthony.comwww.instagram.com/thisisdavidanthonywww.facebook.com/thisisdavidanthonywww.thisisdavidanthony.tumblr.comCheers,  Show some love packagePostcard with californian design and a personal and handwritten thank you straight from my heart for supporting me.Earlybird packageAs one of the first 25 supporters you get the book with some 80s themed stickers and a secret goodie for a special earlybird price so you will save 10 euros.Signature packageYou’ll get Suburban Neverland The Book.

<p>We are '<i>The Glitterati Syndicate</i>', a small group of dedicated, passionate photographers, with our own individual styles. Currently in the third year of a BA(hons) photography degree at Edinburgh Napier, it is time to really put our work out there and start making a name for ourselves. We each will be producing work that deals with our own take on human intimacy.</p>
<p>'<i>Human Intimacy</i>' - Humans feel a fundamental need to connect, love and be loved, to share and essentially to be intimate. Intimacy is an elusive and ambiguous term within society and perception of it varies largely throughout cultural and historical models. </p>
<p>The diversity and multitude of meanings attached to the term 'intimacy' is what will be explored; it's definitions, analytical potential for understanding social change and heterogeneous nature of human practices of intimacy. The visual representation of what intimacy means to each individual and the many ways in which we, as people can feel intimate or lack intimacy.  We as collective intend to explore what intimacy means to us and how important it's existence or lack of may be within life, culture, society, health and relationships.</p>
<p>The funds donated will be used to finance the production of the exhibition.</p>

<p>The exhibition will be held at The Biscuit Factory, Edinburgh, Scotland on 6th-12th April 2018. Free admission.</p>

Emotions! È la prima mostra fotografica internazionale sugli sport paralimpici ed i suoi protagonisti ai giorni nostri.

Nel 2016 esporranno 10 fotografi internazionali a Torino, Rio2016 e infine a Roma.
Il nostro obiettivo sono le EMOZIONI positive: creare un atteggiamento di curiosità nei confronti dello sport disabile, dove molto c’è ancora da scoprire e da sostenere. Promuovere l’integrazione sociale, celebrare lo sport come elemento costitutivo del dialogo e della cooperazione fra i paesi, sostenere lo sport come strumento di recupero dell’indipendenza e della fiducia a seguito di un trauma, sono i temi portanti della Mostra.
Il contenuto: 30 fotografie sugli sport paralimpici e i suoi protagonisti. Immagini con una storia importante da raccontare, dal punto di vista dell'atleta e del fotografo. Workshop formativi e divulgativi completeranno la rassegna.

<p>The <strong>""Network of Photographers for Palestine""</strong> is a small organisation with big ideas. We have already exhibited in Palestine, major cities in the UK and the US, the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh, as well as small villages such as Al Mas'ra, near Bethlehem and Lochinver in the Highlands of Scotland. By showing the highest quality photography, we aim to let Palestinians  tell their own stories.  In so doing we wish  to counter prevailing  representations of Palestinians  as either ""victims"" or ""terrorists"".</p>

<p><strong>Mahmoud al Kurd</strong> is indeed one of the most outstanding creative spirits in Palestinian  photography today. His unique vision has won him acclaim throughout the world. (In 2014 Mahmoud exhibited in Paris, and in 2017 he won the Karimah Aboud Photography Award). </p>

A number of people have informed us that the the ""Back it"" button is not functioning reliably on this site. If you experience any difficulties please select a ""perk"" to the value you would like to donate, and this should work. You do not have to accept your ""perk"" , of course, and we will be in touch with you after the appeal closes about this. Many thanks for your patience. We are in touch with Indiegogo about this fault in their system.
The ""Network of Photographers for Palestine"" is a small organisation with big ideas. We have already exhibited in Palestine, major cities in the UK and the US, the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh, as well as small villages such as Al Mas'ra, near Bethlehem and Lochinver in the Highlands of Scotland. By showing the highest quality photography, we aim to let Palestinians  tell their own stories.  In so doing we wish  to counter prevailing  representations of Palestinians  as either ""victims"" or ""terrorists"".

Mahmoud al Kurd is indeed one of the most outstanding creative spirits in Palestinian  photography today. His unique vision has won him acclaim throughout the world. (In 2014 Mahmoud exhibited in Paris, and in 2017 he won the Karimah Aboud Photography Award). 
 We plan to host a tour of Scotland for Mahmoud in April of this year when he will be exhibiting and speaking in the three major Scottish cities of Edinburgh, Glasgow and Inverness. He will also be open to invitations from other parts of the UK after completing his Scottish tour.  
In 2016, NPP hosted a highly successful tour for the prominent photo-journalist Hamde Abu Rachme , and  we have built up extensive experience in curating exhibitions of Palestinian photography and associated events.Cost Breakdown: However travelling to and from Gaza is not cheap.

From 2011 - 2013 I was based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia working for a number of NGOs. While many people only know about Ethiopia from past famines and difficulties, the present reality is strikingly different. </p><p></p>
<p>In
the past 40 years Ethiopia has had two leaders: Mengistu Haile Mariam, a
communist dictator from the Southern Amhara region and Meles Zenawi, a
capitalist dictator from the Northern Tigray region. Ethiopians have never
known true democracy. Instead, they are offered “restricted” democracy. Their
votes aren’t counted and their disapprovals are blatantly ignored. But as one
of Africa’s most populous nations, and the seat of the African Union for the
past 50 years, the kettle is beginning to boil. An old and proud race of
people, directly linked to the origins of our human ancestry, is growing weary
and angry. </p>
<p>  Dissidents are arrested as terrorists,
exiled or killed. The government has taken a page from George W. Bush’s Patriot
Act playbook and placed nearly every aspect of civilian life under the umbrella
of “anti-terrorism” legislation - thereby legalizing martial law.</p>
<p>  The Arab Spring uprisings have emboldened
the most oppressed citizens to fight for equality and a voice in the global
arena. In Ethiopia, to quash these angry mummers, all access to media is state
controlled and censored for objectionable content. Opposition parties are
banned under any pretext. Television news is used as state propaganda to
showcase the extent to which economic greed has lowered the international
rankings of major western countries like America and Spain. But criticism
within Ethiopia is never tolerated. Ethiopia, the “Lion of Judah,” can do no
wrong. Any attempt at transparency and accountability is a ploy to further gain
foreign investments and aid. </p>
<p>  As a staunch ally of The United States in
the War on Terror in the Horn of Africa, Ethiopia is our Christian buffer
against the rising tide of Islamic militants in Somalia and the region.
Ethiopia and Kenya, as well as other AU member states provide a reasonable
Maginot Line along their boarder so that we don’t have to suffer the
embarrassment of another “Black Hawk Down.” And for their efforts, we western
nations turn a blind eye to humanitarian abuses and questionable election
practices.</p>
<p>  Every country has a wealthy, privileged class
and a poor, working class. And it would be wrong to think there is a unanimous
consensus on which policies will benefit the most people and generate the most
good. To those affiliated with the ruling elite, change represents a grave risk
to their livelihood and economy. While the working poor desperately want income
parity. Because those with the least greatly outnumber those with the most,
true democracy, as practiced by the ballot, is a serious threat to the leaders and their constituents. In other
words, a functioning democracy is not a universal ideal.</p>
<p>No
one will argue that better roads are always needed, and that new luxury hotels
are a boon to the tourism industry. But one must also ask who will drive on
those new roads and who will stay in those luxury hotels? </p>
<p>  The Kingdom of Original Man is a
photographic document of Ethiopia’s capital city Addis Ababa. For two years I
have met and photographed these strikingly beautiful, quiet, reserved people. I
have attended their wedding celebrations and their funerals. I have shared
their meals and danced to their music. I even learned a little Amharic in the
process. </p>
<p>  But
most importantly, I showed my Ethiopians friends that it’s okay to poke humor
at the ridiculous and the inane. And they in turn, felt free to just let go and
laugh at themselves. Ethiopians want the same thing that everyone wants: to
live and let live. They want to travel freely. They want to see what the world
has to offer. And they want the chance to make it on their own or fail by their
own to live and how to die.</p>
<p>  The time for a
book on Ethiopia has never been better than it is now. A longstanding Prime
Minister - that had no plans of ever leaving office voluntarily - has died. The
elections next year are an open door for new leadership and strategic planning.
But rumors abound that Azeb Zenawi, the powerful widow of Meles Zenawi, may
throw her name on the ballot, thereby extending her powerful empire. The
Ethiopian constitution has been amended to allow for three Deputy Prime
Ministers instead of one. This does not bode well for PM Hailemariam Desalegn
re-election campaign. In short, the deck is stacked against a free and fair
election. </p>
<p>These persistent frustrations hint at an inevitable “Arab
Spring” style uprising. A revolution is brewing in Ethiopia.  But as a country that does not allow public
dissent, civil rebellion could lead to massive loss of life. It is my sincere
belief that this book project must come to fruition and soon. </p>

<p>I just started a new job at one of the local TV stations as a production assistant.  Since a production assistant is pretty much an entry level position, money is tight for me at the moment.  This campaign is to help raise funds for new photography supplies.  There are a few art galleries in Fargo that I am applying for to be a member.  If this happens, I will finally have the opportunity to display my work within this area.  For professional reasons, one of the requirements is to have a few of my works printed and framed.  Most of my material like mat board and frames were used up last year.  </p>
<p><strong>WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?</strong></p>
<p>Anyone who is an artist knows that supplies are not cheap.  Not to mention getting your work out there for others to see.  My goal is $750.  The majority of the funding will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mat Board</li>
<li>Printer Ink</li>
<li>Paper</li>
<li>Frames</li>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to come view this page!</p></div>","Hi!  My name is John Beaudine.  I am a photographer residing in Fargo, ND.  Some of my work has been featured in a few juried shows around the country.  Most recently at 1650 Gallery in Los Angeles.  I aim to start getting my work recognized around the Fargo area this year.   
I just started a new job at one of the local TV stations as a production assistant.  Since a production assistant is pretty much an entry level position, money is tight for me at the moment.  This campaign is to help raise funds for new photography supplies.  There are a few art galleries in Fargo that I am applying for to be a member.  If this happens, I will finally have the opportunity to display my work within this area.  For professional reasons, one of the requirements is to have a few of my works printed and framed.  Most of my material like mat board and frames were used up last year.  
WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?
Anyone who is an artist knows that supplies are not cheap.  Not to mention getting your work out there for others to see.  My goal is $750.  The majority of the funding will go towards:

Mat Board
Printer Ink
Paper
Frames
Glass
Any of the leftover funds will be set towards entry fees for juried shows that I plan to submit my work to within the next few months.     
If I do not reach my goal, whatever funds I receive will help with purchasing a few of the supplies.  The main focus more than likey is the mat board and frames.  My personal goal to get my work framed and presented to the galleries sometime in early in May.

Hello, I am Lee Klawans. I have been
photographing live bands, models, and weddings in Chicago for the last 10
years.  A few years ago, I started a
project to have a gallery show of pictures of brides in unexpected public
locals. Most of the brides are my musician friends. This is that project, it needs your help. Many more sample photos here.


The Impact


My friends are surely wondering when
I am going to show the photos.  They
have been collecting virtual dust in my back up drive all these years.  You can help get them out of my computer and
on to the walls and my pals can see their beautiful selves in large scale
photos.


What We Need & What You Get
All of the money raised will be used
to print and frame the photos 20 by 30 inches. It will cost $100 dollars per
picture and I will show 30 of them. If I don’t meet the goal, I will scale back
the size of the prints but the show will and must go on. When you contribute,
you can get the print of your choice in various sizes of any photo I own,
including many local, national and international music acts or any of the bride

Starting in Perth, Western Australia, we drove on my trusted Mitsubishi Triton towards North. We explore many different spots along the west coast, from the desert, beautiful orange cliffs, white sands beaches, narrow gorges and I even got the opportunity to swim with the whale sharks. It took us about a month to explore Western Australia.</p><p>Then we continued to Northern Territory visiting the two national parks, Leitchfield national park and Kakadu national park. Then I cross my way to Queensland where I drove thousands of km on corrugated gravel roads, passing through countless river crossing to reach the northernmost part of Australia.</p><p>From there we continue south towards Tasmania while we stop along the way. Some of the most memorable stops are Diving in Yongala shipwreck, sailing in Whitsunday, exploring the great ocean roads and much more. From Tasmania, we drove to the Red Center, where the most iconic rock is located, Uluru. We spent days exploring the canyons and the famous landscapes on a 50 deg C weather.</p><p>From there I drove 24 hours straight to go back to Perth passing through the Outback way (a shortcut road that was historically used to cross from North of Queensland to Western Australia).</p><div>

This photobook will capture the beautiful tropic landscapes during my trip from Jakarta to Lombok as well as from my previous trip in Flores Archipelago. During this time we explore volcanos, paddy fields, beautiful pristine waters and much more.

 
 Australia Photobook – 40,000 km in 4 months Around AustraliaWhen I got back to Perth, I quickly plan for my trip around Australia Continent. Starting in Perth, Western Australia, we drove on my trusted Mitsubishi Triton towards North. We explore many different spots along the west coast, from the desert, beautiful orange cliffs, white sands beaches, narrow gorges and I even got the opportunity to swim with the whale sharks. It took us about a month to explore Western Australia.Then we continued to Northern Territory visiting the two national parks, Leitchfield national park and Kakadu national park. Then I cross my way to Queensland where I drove thousands of km on corrugated gravel roads, passing through countless river crossing to reach the northernmost part of Australia.From there we continue south towards Tasmania while we stop along the way. Some of the most memorable stops are Diving in Yongala shipwreck, sailing in Whitsunday, exploring the great ocean roads and much more. From Tasmania, we drove to the Red Center, where the most iconic rock is located, Uluru. We spent days exploring the canyons and the famous landscapes on a 50 deg C weather.From there I drove 24 hours straight to go back to Perth passing through the Outback way (a shortcut road that was historically used to cross from North of Queensland to Western Australia).

 
 Canada Photobook – Vancouver, Yellowknife and the Canadian Rockies In January 2019 I started my journey in Canada. We flew across the world to chase the snow and the Northern Lights. We arrived in Vancouver and spent time exploring the city and the surroundings. From there we flew to Yellowknife where we experience an extreme change of weather. From 40 deg C summer in Perth to -53 deg C cold winter in Yellowknife. We spent 10 days where we were blessed with Aurora Borealis dancing in the sky for every single night we were there. In April, I moved to Lake Louise in the heart of the Canadian Rockies. Since then I’ve been exploring countless hiking trails, lakes and mountains to fully experience the beautiful Canadian Rockies.",4.0,3,"1 Campaign

<h3>About Me<br/>
</h3>My name is Amanda Fehring and I am a photographer living in New York City.  My husband and I have lived here for two years.  This remarkable place has been called the center of the universe, and rightfully so.  It is an inspiring, yet incredibly daunting and hectic place to live: the exact opposite of where I'm from.  I originally fell in love with the art of photography watching my mother shoot the incredibly beautiful landscapes in my native Montana.  I gave up the serenity that was plentiful and taken for granted, for the pursuit of dreams.  I have found this city an extraordinary place to capture moments and after comparing various images from my past I couldn't help but notice subtle and poetic connections between the two opposite worlds.  Visual comparisons of natural beauty and beauty created by humanity can be a scintillating experience. <br/><br/><p>I have created a show using landscapes and cityscape, paired in ways that reveal the  beauty of the moment while complimenting and teaching one and the other.  By donating to my campaign you will be bringing my vision to life and allowing the public and the world see what I have created with the help of the Atlantic Gallery in Chelsea.<br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need and How You Will Benefit</h3> <p>Here's how you dear people can help!<br/></p> <ul>
<li>It is my goal to raise $2500!  This sum will cover the costs of:</li>
<li> Membership at Atlantic Gallery, in Chelsea<br/>
</li> <li>The cost of a 1 Month Exhibition in the space</li>
<li>The cost of Printing and Framing for the exhibition</li>
</ul>
<p>By donating you not only get listed as a permanent donor on my website, to show my appreciation and gratitude you also get a personal invitation to the exhibition opening!  There are other perks too!<br/></p>
<p>If the full goal isn't reached, the money that is will go directly to the Membership and as much of the exhibition costs as possible.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In June, I sent my materials to galleries all over the City and the Tri-state area and have received lots of wonderful feedback and lots of interest in my work.  One of the interested parties was the Atlantic Gallery. This campaign will start the ball rolling, get my name and work out there, and show who I am and what I am capable of!  <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> This exhibit and through it, the start of achieving my dreams would be impossible without you.  The costs of this city can inhibit established artists as much as new but with your help, I know this can come to fruition.<br/></p> <ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Even if you can't donate, I so greatly appreciate the time you took to read about my campaign and my work. <br/></p> <ul>

My
name is <b>Mathieu</b> and I am 26 years old. </div><div><br/></div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">3 years ago, I finished my MBA and MSc
in Entrepreneurship from EDHEC Business School (France). <span>I accepted a job with a large company as a Strategy Analyst</span>. They posted me at
their office in Mumbai, India. And, ever since, my life has taken some <b>surprising</b>
turns. </div><div><br/></div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">As a Frenchman, I was amazed by the <b>colours</b> of Indian culture. In one
short year, I learned so many fascinating things. My experiences led me to
contemplate the value of <b>Beluga's journey</b> more, with each passing rickshaw. </div><div style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></div><div style=""text-align: justify;""><b>I
have always been passionate about education and travel, and it seemed like a

I am confident enough in the project to invest my savings, and now, I’m turning to the IndieGoGo community to raise the added funds I need to make this a reality.</div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1124896/files/20141231125150-Subtitle_-_our_little_inspiration.jpg?1420059110"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>3 years ago, I used to babysit a little girl. </b>She always had more questions than I had answers. Once, when she wanted to know about the pyramids in Egypt, she impatiently told me my responses weren't good enough. </p>
<p><b>So she gave me her favourite toy, a cute little lamb, and made me promise to show her the world through the eyes of her sheep. That’s how my adventures with Beluga began...</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1124972/files/20141231142837-Around_Paris_-5.jpg?1420064917"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>I kept my promise and started writing the ‘Diary of a Travelling Sheep’, chronicling her discoveries in France, Belgium, Italy or Spain. Every time we returned from one of our trips, I would read the diary to the little girl and show her pictures of all the places we’d visited. With each chapter, she learnt something new and beautiful. <b>And she would always listen to each story and keenly study each picture with a S-M-I-L-E on her face. </b>
</div><div><br/></div><div>Beluga made it possible for her to<b> travel the world without leaving her bedroom</b>.</div><div style=""text-align: justify;""><b><br/></b></div><div style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Today, we want to share Beluga's adventures with thousands of children around the world.</b></div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">

<p><span></span></p>The same way adults refer to their <b>travel guides</b> for information, <b>Beluga's Travel Book</b> allows children to explore new places, discover new cultures and have fun while they learn.
</div><div style=""text-align: justify;""><span><br/></span></div><div>Beluga's Travel Book helps the reader to <b>discover </b>a culture through descriptions of <b>people, language, cuisine, notable sights</b> such as monuments, religious institutions, <b>natural wonders</b>, and countless others.</div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">

<p>For example, if a child is ‘visiting’ Ladakh, he can flip to that chapter and learn that most people there are Buddhist (and what that means), that ‘Hello’ in Ladakhi is ‘Julley’, that most people eat Momos, that the Shanti Stupa symbolises peace and that The Himalayas are the World’s Tallest Mountain Range.</p>

<p></p>
<h3><span><b>The Travel Book is playful</b></span></h3>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p>With <b>illustrations</b>, children can <b>colour</b> in the pictures of Beluga with a wise monk in his Maroon robes.</p>
<p>With <b>quizzes</b> and <b>games</b>, they can complete – 6 Across; How do you say ‘Hello’ in Ladakhi (5 letters). </p>
<p>With <b>cultural challenges</b>, they can ‘Make a paper replica of the spiritual flags’.</p>
<p>There are countless such activities for little explorers.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span></span></p>

<p></p>
<h3><span>The Travel Book is interactive</span></h3>
<p><span></span></p>
<p>If we reach our strech goal, <b>a website and an app </b>will be developed to allow children access maps and click on a state for more detailed information on each subject and a wider selection of activities. Most importantly, they can join the <b>‘Comm-ewe-nity’ </b>and connect with a network of other 'little adventurers'. </p>

<p><b>Humans learn from interactions, and we believe this will multiply the opportunities to learn and adventure for each child. </b>Kids love sharing their stories, experiences, itineraries, and travel tips!  </p>

find and foster the adventurer in each child by giving her/him a glimpse of the
vibrant arts and cultures of our universe.
And for that, we
have created a playful, interactive and educational travel book, for kids and
dreamers, that will help children discover the wonders of the world.
Our first edition? India!





My
name is Mathieu and I am 26 years old. 3 years ago, I finished my MBA and MSc
in Entrepreneurship from EDHEC Business School (France). I accepted a job with a large company as a Strategy Analyst. They posted me at
their office in Mumbai, India. And, ever since, my life has taken some surprising
turns. As a Frenchman, I was amazed by the colours of Indian culture. In one
short year, I learned so many fascinating things. My experiences led me to
contemplate the value of Beluga's journey more, with each passing rickshaw. I
have always been passionate about education and travel, and it seemed like a
perfect time to test my convictions.So I quit my job and decided to pursue 'Beluga - The Travel Book for Little Adventurers' full time. 6 months later, after all the awe inspiring places I've seen, and beautiful faces I've encountered, I know, without a doubt, that sharing these experiences with children will enrich their perspective. I am confident enough in the project to invest my savings, and now, I’m turning to the IndieGoGo community to raise the added funds I need to make this a reality.

3 years ago, I used to babysit a little girl. She always had more questions than I had answers. Once, when she wanted to know about the pyramids in Egypt, she impatiently told me my responses weren't good enough. 
So she gave me her favourite toy, a cute little lamb, and made me promise to show her the world through the eyes of her sheep. That’s how my adventures with Beluga began...





I kept my promise and started writing the ‘Diary of a Travelling Sheep’, chronicling her discoveries in France, Belgium, Italy or Spain. Every time we returned from one of our trips, I would read the diary to the little girl and show her pictures of all the places we’d visited. With each chapter, she learnt something new and beautiful. And she would always listen to each story and keenly study each picture with a S-M-I-L-E on her face. 
Beluga made it possible for her to travel the world without leaving her bedroom.Today, we want to share Beluga's adventures with thousands of children around the world.

The same way adults refer to their travel guides for information, Beluga's Travel Book allows children to explore new places, discover new cultures and have fun while they learn.
Beluga's Travel Book helps the reader to discover a culture through descriptions of people, language, cuisine, notable sights such as monuments, religious institutions, natural wonders, and countless others.



For example, if a child is ‘visiting’ Ladakh, he can flip to that chapter and learn that most people there are Buddhist (and what that means), that ‘Hello’ in Ladakhi is ‘Julley’, that most people eat Momos, that the Shanti Stupa symbolises peace and that The Himalayas are the World’s Tallest Mountain Range.



The Travel Book is playful


With illustrations, children can colour in the pictures of Beluga with a wise monk in his Maroon robes.
With quizzes and games, they can complete – 6 Across; How do you say ‘Hello’ in Ladakhi (5 letters). 
With cultural challenges, they can ‘Make a paper replica of the spiritual flags’.
There are countless such activities for little explorers.




The Travel Book is interactive

If we reach our strech goal, a website and an app will be developed to allow children access maps and click on a state for more detailed information on each subject and a wider selection of activities. Most importantly, they can join the ‘Comm-ewe-nity’ and connect with a network of other 'little adventurers'. 


Humans learn from interactions, and we believe this will multiply the opportunities to learn and adventure for each child. Kids love sharing their stories, experiences, itineraries, and travel tips!  



'The Travel Book for Little Adventurers' allows readers to interact with their ‘foreign’ surroundings in a way they can enjoy. 
If children eventually visit India, they'll get more involved in the process, thanks to the ewe-some knowledge they get from Beluga.


We want to show children how spectacularly diverse the world can be so that they can dream! So they can grow up to be adventurers who appreciate diversity as a positive thing.



Francis Bacon said, ‘Travel, in the younger sort, is a part of education’.
This is truer today than ever before because:
1. We belong to an increasingly interconnected world, where children need to learn to socialize with others from different cultures.
2. Exploring new places may help children find a life-long passion, for example, they may see Beluga playing a ‘tabla’ and decide to learn the Indian drum.
3. The absolutely most important reason and one closest to my heart is – 'Perhaps travel cannot prevent bigotry, but by demonstrating that all people cry and laugh, it can introduce the idea that if we try and understand each other, we may even become friends'… Maya Angelou



In a time when kids are exposed to so much negativity, most of which results from misconceptions and a lack of understanding of other cultures, we want to offer a new generation of children the opportunity to empathize with and appreciate one another. To become FRIENDS.
With Beluga as their travel and learning buddy, we want to empower children to:
1. Create friend-sheeps
2. Step out of their comfort zone
3. Adopt a global perspective
4. Celebrate cultural differences
So that they become thoughtful global citizens and embrace education as an adventure.




Beluga and I met many young children, a beautiful coincidence during our travels, who we know you would be inspired by too. There are so many children who lack the opportunities to exercise their potential. 


Art Culture Education (ACE) is the French not-for-profit organization I founded to make Beluga reach out to these kids and make them smile too. Combining elements of history, geography and art, ACE endeavours to organize workshops around India to open children’s minds, foster their creativity, discover and nurture their latent talents.



The proceeds from the sales of ‘'Beluga - The Travel Book for Little Adventurers’, the India Edition, will go towards a project that empower these children.

All the prints are on fibre based paper. I discovered photography through a friend of mine.About four years ago, I was living in Bristol and one day I received a parcel from this friend who was then living in Paris. The content was this Praktica camera with a few black & white films and a letter. It read – this is now your camera, learn to use it!Now, photography is more than just a hobby. It is a personal attitude, an easy way to approach people who I find interesting. People who with their stories make me discover and understand more about the world around me. If I had the luxury of time and more importantly money, I would spend more time focusing on practising and developing my ideas and versatilities - especially focusing on improving my printing skills and exploring  venues who would potentially exhibit my work.I have just started a crowdfunding page - via this link, people who like my work can support my projects to get them into venues where they will be seen. Mariano Doronzowww.marianodoronzo.commariano.doronzo@hotmail.comFacebook Artistic Page: www.facebook.com/mariano.doronzo/Personal Blog: mezzosangueblog.wordpress.com/ Disciplines: Photography, Writing, Poetry.Collaboration also with several collectives:

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Live Your Dream is an International Photography Exhibition on <strong>May 9<sup>th</sup> – June 24<sup>th</sup></strong> that celebrates the passion for photography in our communities. <strong>Santiago de Chile</strong>.</p>
<p>Every big project starts with an idea. Turning that idea into reality is almost always harder than it looks. The project is divided into 5 parts – chapters.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> we do not sell the works, but we can contact you with the photographer, if you want to get some images, just contact Hanna at <u>arthannna@gmail.com</u>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485190615/wutzbhsbbfjz5wzaemeg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Chapter One: </strong>“Connection”</p>
<p>First, you have to put yourself in the place to receive the truth. We live in an extremely noisy world with all kinds of frequencies coming at us - commitments, deadlines, fix this, do that, plans, expectations - and they all make it hard to get clarity and peace of mind. So you have to consciously put yourself in a place to receive that clarity.</p>
<p>Find that time to be in a place to receive the truth, where you do not have to look over your shoulder because you are too busy to see life, to see the world. Find your right connection. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485190673/ggthzlsab8d7jetce4oj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Chapter Two: </strong>“Reflection”</p>
<p>Life is not easy. Do not try to make it that way. It's not fair, it never was, it isn't now, it won't ever be. Do not fall into the entitlement trap of feeling you are a victim, you are not. Get over it and get on with it. And yes, most things are more rewarding, when you break a sweat to get them. </p>
<p>Nothing in your life is not a reflection of who you are.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485190764/qqkaiserhq79wdkgyqst.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Chapter Three:</strong> “Willpower”</p>
<p>You are going to have some ups, and you are going to have some downs. Most people give up on themselves easily. You know the human spirit is powerful? There is nothing as powerful - it is hard to kill the human spirit. It takes courage to act. At the end of your feelings is nothing, but at the end of every principle is a promise. Do not allow your emotions to control you. We are emotional. And if you do not discipline and contain your emotions, they will use you. </p>
<p>Live your life with passion! With some drive.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Chapter Four:</strong> “Ability”</p>
<p>​A lot of things that we want to do, a lot of places we would love to go, a lot of things we would love to experience, we just stop at 'but'. 'But' will cause you to hide out behind fear, 'but' will cause you to come up will all types of excuses that you can validate your inaction. 'But' is a dream-killer.  A lot of people say 'no' to things, and they do not even know, what they are saying 'no' to! Do not allow 'but' to keep you in the corner.  Do what you can, where you are with that you have, and never be satisfied. I want to know you for your ability, not your disability.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485190841/oyxzlspppkjcviborzb7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Chapter Five: </strong>“Hero”</p>
<p>You are not only a special person created at a special time - you have some special inside you. If you going to win the fight of your life, you can't be afraid to fight. You've gone too far to quit, you've come too far to give up. Impossible is just a big word, thrown around by small men. If you are going to fall, fall back on anything except your faith. Fall forward. You are the Hero of your own story. </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Live Your Dream is an International Photography Exhibition on May 9th – June 24th that celebrates the passion for photography in our communities. Santiago de Chile.
Every big project starts with an idea. Turning that idea into reality is almost always harder than it looks. The project is divided into 5 parts – chapters.
Note: we do not sell the works, but we can contact you with the photographer, if you want to get some images, just contact Hanna at arthannna@gmail.com.

Chapter One: “Connection”
First, you have to put yourself in the place to receive the truth. We live in an extremely noisy world with all kinds of frequencies coming at us - commitments, deadlines, fix this, do that, plans, expectations - and they all make it hard to get clarity and peace of mind. So you have to consciously put yourself in a place to receive that clarity.
Find that time to be in a place to receive the truth, where you do not have to look over your shoulder because you are too busy to see life, to see the world. Find your right connection. 

Chapter Two: “Reflection”
Life is not easy. Do not try to make it that way. It's not fair, it never was, it isn't now, it won't ever be. Do not fall into the entitlement trap of feeling you are a victim, you are not. Get over it and get on with it. And yes, most things are more rewarding, when you break a sweat to get them. 
Nothing in your life is not a reflection of who you are.

Chapter Three: “Willpower”
You are going to have some ups, and you are going to have some downs. Most people give up on themselves easily. You know the human spirit is powerful? There is nothing as powerful - it is hard to kill the human spirit. It takes courage to act. At the end of your feelings is nothing, but at the end of every principle is a promise. Do not allow your emotions to control you. We are emotional. And if you do not discipline and contain your emotions, they will use you. 
Live your life with passion! With some drive.
Chapter Four: “Ability”
​A lot of things that we want to do, a lot of places we would love to go, a lot of things we would love to experience, we just stop at 'but'. 'But' will cause you to hide out behind fear, 'but' will cause you to come up will all types of excuses that you can validate your inaction. 'But' is a dream-killer.  A lot of people say 'no' to things, and they do not even know, what they are saying 'no' to! Do not allow 'but' to keep you in the corner.  Do what you can, where you are with that you have, and never be satisfied. I want to know you for your ability, not your disability.  

Chapter Five: “Hero”
You are not only a special person created at a special time - you have some special inside you. If you going to win the fight of your life, you can't be afraid to fight. You've gone too far to quit, you've come too far to give up. Impossible is just a big word, thrown around by small men. If you are going to fall, fall back on anything except your faith. Fall forward. You are the Hero of your own story. 

Who We Are
We are an international young team currently located in Santiago. Above all, we believe in the power of our members. We're in the business of selling pleasure. So we don't sell art or photography. We ""sell"" dreams.




What We Need Your Help With
Raise a minimum of $15 000 to get all 100 images printed and mounted, pre-exhibition and post-exhibition costs, work of people outside the team, promotion and etc.

<p>Hi and thanks so much for checking out my IndieGoGo crowdfunding campaign.</p>
<p>My name is Ian Thuillier and I am an Irish photographer from Dublin. </p>
<p>In 2017 I followed the Formula 1 circus around the world as a freelance photographer for my book, The Violence of Speed.  Through my lens I captured the colour, fanfare and excitement of the world of Formula 1.  The images in the book document the speed, adrenalin, noise and excitement that make up a Grand Prix weekend.</p>
<p>Aside from the imagery, there are unique stories from 12 past and present Formula 1 drivers talking about their experiences in the cockpit of a Formula 1 car. </p>
<p>It’s easy to forget that as we watch these cars racing around a track at 200mph, what isn't apparent is what is actually going on inside the cockpit.  Television really doesn’t convey the huge forces exerted on the drivers.</p>
<p>For 2 hours, a driver’s vision becomes blurred, constant vibrations travel from the steering wheel through their body, they become dehydrated and they tear muscles in their arms and neck due to the enormous g-forces. </p>
<p>From Nikki Lauda in the 1970’s through to Damon Hill and Jacques Villeneuve in the 1990’s to present day drivers. I tried to get a sense of the violence of speed that drivers experience and to present the views of as many eras of F1 as possible.</p>
</div><div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>WHAT YOU GET</strong></u></p>
<p>The Violence of Speed will be printed in October 2018. This allows me time to include more imagery of the 2018 season before it goes to print and the finished books will be sent to everyone in November 2018.</p>
<p>The perks on offer are 3 x large signed museum quality archival pigment prints, an exclusive 5 x set post card pack and the Violence of Speed book at a reduced rate for the first 150 contributors..........</p>
<p>And last but not least all contributors will get the chance to partake in an online charity auction for the number 1 edition of the book signed by the 12 F1 drivers who contributed their stories.  This auction is not open to the public, only to the campaign contributors.</p>

<p>The proceeds from the auction of the book will be donated to the 'Starlight Children's Foundation' charity- a nonprofit organization which brightens the lives of seriously ill children and their families, by replacing pain, fear and stress with fun, joy and laughter.</p>
</div><div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>THE GOAL</strong></u></p>
