    The Impact

This year's CA Afterschool & Summer Challenge is vital to securing long-term funding for out-of-school time programs. These programs hold the future of California by protecting our most important resource - our children. OST programs make a  significant difference:

$1 invested in afterschool programs saves taxpayers $9
Program participation increases school
attendance, grades, test scores, and instills a sense of confidence and trust. 
Quality programs can create opportunities for
youth to feel recognized, gain a sense of responsibility, and peer mentorship 
These programs inspire youth to explore a career, vocation, or
college track
Children and youth discover of new skills, people, and ways of
looking at life


Out-of-school time programs equip children and youth with the skills for school, work and life. Staff leading programs foster strong relationships and create safe environments that enable children to learn 21st century skills, develop socially and emotionally, and gain the skills employers seek most – critical thinking, collaboration and communication. You can learn more about the importance of a quality program here. 




Risks & Challenges 

Without donations to help cover costs of the event, we would
have to charge people to attend the event. Many of our participants are youth and young professionals who could not afford the cost of a fee to attend and with limited funding many programs would be deterred by an added cost. Without these participants to meet with their
legislators we might lose out on funding for future generations of youth who need access to these vital programs.




This year we're facing an important crossroads in the determination of the future of the out-of-school time field. With statewide minimum wage increases, an increase in After School Education & Safety (ASES) Program funding is needed to help cover the rising cost of providing high-quality out-of-school time programs. 

A recent survey conducted by the Partnership for Children & Youth of nearly 600 respondents from 300 school districts in CA paints a grim picture. 

More than 75% of ASES-funded programs have found it is more difficult to retain high quality staff (unable to offer competitive pay) and more difficult to attract and recruit quality staff (unable to offer competitive pay). 
75% of ASES-funded programs also believe it is necessary to reduce the number of enrichment activities offered to children. 

More than 60% of programs also cite a reduction in professional development for staff, an inability to meet the demand of students on waiting lists, and a negative impact on the ability to provide quality academic supports to students. 
Approximately 50% of respondents have had to reduce staff hours. 
Nearly 25% of programs are now serving fewer kids. 





We need a strong, collective voice at the CA Afterschool & Summer Challenge in support of SB645 to increase funding to programs. 
Senate Bill 645 would increase ASES funding by $54 million in 2015/16 to raise the funding formula to $8.50 per student/per day, and establish an annual cost of living adjustment beginning in the 2017/18 fiscal year. This funding correction would improve program providers’ ability to deliver engaging and effective expanded learning services to California students with the highest needs and fewest resources. Without increased funding many afterschool programs will be looking at cost-cutting measures putting thousands of jobs and children's safety at risk.

These horses are an integral part of the ongoing therapy at the farm, which is used to treat people with disabilities including children with Autism. With your potential donation, we will be that much closer to giving these horses a new home.",1.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p><u>HARK's
  Mission:</u></p>
<p>Hark is on a mission to share the real story of ALS and to provide
  a network of compassionate resources for families.</p>
<p><u>HARK’s
  Vision:</u></p>
<p>To change
  the way the world views ALS, and to create a courageous legacy of support for
  families.</p>
<p><u>What is ALS:</u></p>
<p></p>
<p>ALS stands
  for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s
  Disease.  </p>
<p>ALS rapidly
  deteriorates the motor neurons in the brain and the spinal cord that allow
  voluntarily control of muscle movement. As the disease progresses the muscles
  begin to waste away or atrophy, causing increased muscle weakness, paralysis,
  and inability to swallow or breathe. 
  The patient’s mind remains fully cognizant throughout the entirety of
  this agonizing process, with death most commonly occurring within two years.</p>
<p>Scarce
  progress has been made in the area of research, diagnoses, or treatment.  There is presently no cure.</p>

A brief summary of the current state of ALS awareness:
This past summer, the phenomenon
that was the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge ran rampant across the U.S., raising over
$115,000,000 and greatly increasing the public’s perception that ALS exists.
Outside the community, many now
know that ALS exists, yet few still understand how devastating it actually is,
or how inspiring the people are who are left to battle it each day.
A prime example of this was illustrated at a HOTH showing held at major New Jersey University. 
When asked to raise their hands if they had participated in the Ice
Bucket Challenge, the entire audience did so. 
However, when the audience was asked to raise their hands if they knew
what ALS actually was, and NOT A SINGLE person in the crowd raised their hands.
HARK’s Hope on the Horizon “Get
Involved and Help” Tour is here to change that. 
Over the course of the 2015, HARK will bring its mission of
philanthropy, awareness, assistance, and social responsibility amongst our youth
to each of the fifty states with the following ends in mind:
· 
To eradicate the lack of awareness faced by the
ALS community, by educating the upcoming generation about this disease and its

against ALS by calling them to action, to 
“adopt” their university’s ALS family and raise $9,000 for the family’s
direct benefit, exposing them to the tangible positive effects of philanthropy
· 
To directly benefit fifty ALS patients and their
families nationwide in two ways: financially, by donating $10,000 directly to
them, and emotionally, by presenting them with the experience of working with a
group of inspired young adults rallying for their cause
· 
To propagate HARK’S mission of direct and active
support for any and all ALS patients in need, and to build “Healthy, Active,
Responsible Kids” by inspiring the upcoming generation to see beyond themselves
to those in need, and to take action to better the world around them
· 
To continue to unite other small, like-minded
organizations together to share in one another’s missions, and to widen the
reach of a nation wide network of resources and support for the ALS community
· 
To use today’s generation’s knowledge and savvy
of social media networking to optimize social media hits and exposure of the
Hope on the Horizon documentary, and HARK’S overall mission
· 
To raise a total of half a million dollars that
will go directly to the benefit of the patients in need, and to set an example

A Background on HARK, Inc.

HARK's
  Mission:
Hark is on a mission to share the real story of ALS and to provide
  a network of compassionate resources for families.
HARK’s
  Vision:
To change
  the way the world views ALS, and to create a courageous legacy of support for
  families.
What is ALS:

ALS stands
  for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s
  Disease.  
ALS rapidly
  deteriorates the motor neurons in the brain and the spinal cord that allow
  voluntarily control of muscle movement. As the disease progresses the muscles
  begin to waste away or atrophy, causing increased muscle weakness, paralysis,
  and inability to swallow or breathe. 
  The patient’s mind remains fully cognizant throughout the entirety of
  this agonizing process, with death most commonly occurring within two years.
Scarce
  progress has been made in the area of research, diagnoses, or treatment.  There is presently no cure.
What is Hope on the Horizon:




An adventure documentary following two HARK representatives
  Joshua Valentine and Kirk Leslie’s successful mission to summit the 48 highest mountains in New Hampshire in a
  single, 25 day trip to raise awareness and support for ALS patients and
  families.  As it follows their journey,
  the film tells the story of the patients who have rallied behind this
  mission, and serves to educate the viewers about the disease, HARK’s mission,
  and the incredible struggle an ALS patient faces each day.  It concludes with a passionate call to
  action to “Get involved and help” by joining HARK’s mission to battle ALS.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

What happens when urban teenagers enter the woods:To be honest, all kinds of things.  They get really excited about leaves.  They notice every single smell, sight, and sound.  Especially in the dark.  They take pictures of bark and small salamanders and grass clumps and pretty much everything else.  Then their cellphones and cameras die.And then...They freak out a little bit and wonder what is going to happen to them.  And what happens is:  They sweat from hiking for three miles. They guzzle water (ok, some for the first time...seriously).  They learn how to set up a tent. They work as a team to build a fire, and learn to carry their own weight so that dinner gets made.  They yell and hear their echoes.  They hear echoes from other things in the woods and get scared (quickly dashing to the ""safety"" of their tents).  They see what dark is and what the stars look like.  They invent scary stories and tell even more ridiculous ones.  They see a different side of the teachers and of each other that they don't see otherwise.  They sit and are quiet (for two minutes, but still...).This trip was a transformative experience for students who attended last year.  It is experiential learning at its best, offering social, emotional and physical growth.  Our students do something they never thought they would do.  We wish to offer this opportunity to students each year.Other Ways You Can HelpNo contribution to this endeavor is too small.  If you are not personally able to contribute but can help us get the word out via your Facebook, Twitter, etc., we would greatly appreciate the help. Thank you!",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

Auch wenn Du selbst keine Kinder hast, profitierst Du von Kollegen, Mitarbeitern, Nachbarn, Freunden, die mit der chinesischen Kultur und Sprache vertraut sind. Die als Mittler zwischen den Welten für Annäherung und Gemeinsamkeiten sorgen. Englisch sprechen übrigens „nur“ knapp 5% der Menschen auf der Welt. Und natürlich würde niemand die Wichtigkeit der englischen Sprache und des anglo-amerikanischen Kulturraums für unsere Gesellschaft  in Frage stellen, oder?Unser Erzieher-Team braucht alle UnterstützungDie Grundfinanzierung der Kita ist gesichert, jedoch verlangt die gelebte Bilingualität besonderen Einsatz. Unser engagiertes Team meistert diese Herausforderung mit viel Leidenschaft. In jeder Gruppe gibt es mindestens eine deutschsprachige und eine chinesische Erzieherin, deren Bezahlung durch das Berliner Gutscheinsystem gedeckt ist. Durch gemeinsames Erleben und interaktive Alltagsgestaltung bekommen die Kinder spielerisch beide Sprachen und die Kultur beider Länder vermittelt. Da das Sprach- und Kulturumfeld deutsch ist, möchten wir einen besonders starken Akzent auf die chinesische Sprache & Kultur setzen, um den Kindern das Lernen zu erleichtern. Eine weitere chinesische Erzieherin soll dabei helfen.12.000 Euro für fünf Monate: viel für uns, wenig für vieleIn kleinen Schritten Richtung Zukunft – das gilt für uns in vielerlei Hinsicht. Wir möchten zunächst für fünf Monate die Finanzierung einer zusätzlichen chinesischen Erzieherkraft in der Drachengruppe (das ist die Krippe, für Kinder von 1 bis 3 Jahren) sichern. Zudem soll der deutsch-chinesische Musikunterricht gefördert werden. Wir haben einmal die Woche eine deutsche Musiklehrerin zu Besuch. Schön wäre, wenn wir darüber hinaus auch eine chinesische Musiklehrerin finanzieren könnten. Sollten wir nicht die ganze Summe zusammenbekommen, werden wir eine chinesische Aushilfe so lange finanzieren, bis das Geld alle ist. Und dann den nächsten Schritt planen. Einen nach dem anderen. 2008 waren wir die erste deutsch-chinesische Kita  in Deutschland, glücklicherweise inzwischen mit einigen Nachahmern – auch damals haben wir mit einem kleinen Schritt begonnen.  Komm uns besuchen!Egal, ob Du uns finanziell unterstützen möchtest oder nach anderen Möglichkeiten für ein Engagement suchst: Wir freuen uns immer über interessierten Besuch (nur nach Terminabsprache). Die Deutsch-Chinesische Kita befindet sich in Berlin-Prenzlauer Berg im internationalen und kinderfreundlichen Kiez zwischen Helmholtz- und Kollwitzplatz und bietet ganztägige Betreuung von 8-17 Uhr für Kinder von 1-6 Jahren durchgängig in deutscher und chinesischer Sprache an.In 2010 haben wir die Kita erweitert, um zusätzliche Krippenplätze für Kinder unter 3 Jahren zu schaffen, so dass wir seit August insgesamt 27 Plätze anbieten können. Gefördert wurde diese Erweiterung durch das Krippenausbau-Programm der Bundesregierung.Als gemeinnütziger Nonprofit Verein sind wir berechtigt eine Spendenbescheinigung auszustellen laut Freistellungsbescheid vom Finanzamt für Körperschaften l , Stnr. 27/635/53618.Bei Bedarf einer Spendenquittung wenden sie sich bitte an folgende Emailadresse: Info@daschinabuero.org (unter Angabe von Name, Adresse und Überweisungsnachweiss)柏林德中幼儿园：为了培养孩子在未来的全球化世界中有可持续的适应 。   从2008年十月开始，柏林德中幼儿园是在德国领先开创的第一家。 孩子是我们的未来，我们推动德中语言和文化交流的开始也是未来开始的地方。为了孩子，我们需要你的支持！多语言与跨文化能力在今天全世界大部分的人口说汉语，大约有13亿人。这是近13％的世界人口。令人惊讶的是在德国仍然只有很少的中国语言推动和文化交流项目。我们的孩子来自各种家庭，有中德家庭也有其他文化背景的家庭。为了孩子们，我们有一个共同的心愿：就是让我们的孩子在最好的真正的德中文化和语言中成长。为了打造一个更宽广的双语环境，因此幼儿园需要额外的中国幼教人员。为了加大双语的音乐方面推动，因此幼儿园在方面也需要加重投入。你的受益是什么？我们不要扮演高等的幼儿园，也不认为自己是很好强，望子成龙的家长：我们相信在德国的移民社会里中国文化和语言的可持续融合是不可或缺的。我们要欢迎中国的专业人事，员工，同事，朋友。我们还希望，在德国文化里长大的这些孩子，无论他们有没有中国血缘，都能理解和学会中国文化，就感觉像在自己的母文化里一样，而且看到未来可能选择在中国生活。即使你自己没有孩子，你也会受益于这些理解中国文化和语言的同事，员工，邻居以及朋友。这些人会拉近文化的距离和找到文化的共同性。在全世界「只有」将近5％的人说英语。当然没有人会对英语和我们所讨论的英美文化对于德国社会的重要性提出质疑。我们的幼儿园教师小组需要你的各样支持与援助德中幼儿园的基本财务状况是平衡的，不过双语学制的实施，却需要更多特殊的努力。我们有奉献精神的团队以十足的热诚迎接这个挑战。幼儿园里每组小孩都至少有一位德语教师和一位华语教师，这些教师们的薪水由柏林市政府补助。透过共同体验与互动的日常生活，小孩以游戏方式学会了解两国的语言和文化。由于柏林语言和生活环境是德语的，我们希望把重点放在华语和中华文化上面，好让孩子们学习便利。我们希望再多一位华语教师帮助我们。一万二欧元补助五个月：对我们是很大的帮助，对多数人是小数字的集合。一小步一小步的迈向未来，是我们的目标。首先，我们希望在下五个月能为「小龙小组」（１－３岁小组）增多一位华语教师。其次，希望德中语的音乐课程能加强。我们目前每周有一位德语音乐教师上课，如果也能有一位华语音乐教师就太美好了。倘若我们得到你们够多的援助，我们就可暂时多聘请一位华语教师，直到这额外的援助用完，再计划下一步。我们是在２００８年成立的德国第一个德中双语幼儿园，今天已经有其他的双语幼儿园跟上了──我们当年也是一步一步走过来的。欢迎光临参观！不论你是否能援助我们或你用何种方式帮助我们，我们都欢迎你的访问！德中幼儿园的地点在Helmholtz- und Kollwitzplatz 之间的Berlin-Prenzlauer Berg，是一个国际性的儿童友善环境。我们每天从８－１７点提供照护幼儿的德中语全日服务。我们在２０１０年扩大了规模，增加了三岁以下的托婴服务，所以我们从八月开始共有２７个名额。这个扩大规模计划也由德国联邦托婴计划补助。",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>We Want Electoral Reform</h3>
<p>If you're disappointed like I am with the Liberals backing away from their promise of Electoral Reform, but know that you'll never actually get around to sending him a letter about it, join me. I want to send Trudeau hundreds - nay, THOUSANDS - of letters, but in order to do that I need some teamwork.</p>
<p><strong>For each $2 donated, I will send AT LEAST one postcard on your behalf to Trudeau's office, letting him know that we are not happy with his decision to abandon his promise of electoral reform.</strong></p>
<p>Here's what's going to happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have designed a very simple postcard demanding that Trudeau be a leader and bring electoral reform to pass in Canada, as he was elected to do.</li>
<li>I will use all the money I receive from this campaign to print and send as many postcards as possible. I will not keep any money. If the total comes to an awkward amount, I'll chip in a little to round it out and send that last postcard.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have currently priced them at $2 each, just to be safe, but I have a printing house that said they will give me 500 postcards for FREE, and will give me a 50% discount on printing after that. So basically, we're just paying postage, which means I can probably send TWO postcards per person.</p>
<p><strong><i>UPDATE: I have just learned that we can mail the PM office for FREE, no postage needed. That means I will spend ALL THE MONEY on printing. This could wind up being a very large quantity, with the deal I got from the printer. How exciting!</i></strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Postcards</h3>
<p>The cards are very straightforward. I know there are a lot of different opinions on what kind of electoral reform we should have, so I'm not advocating for any particular system. We can stand as a united front asking for change.</p>
<p>Front:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486225364/dzil7tqtpblxb1k9hoor.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Each card will include the name and postal code of the contributor, so that he can see it's not just one nut job sending him a gazillion postcards. You can also put a (SHORT) message in the notes of your order and I'll include it.</p>
<p><i><strong>I will send out a survey to all funders at the end of the campaign requesting your message, if any!</strong></i></p>
</div><div>

</div></div>","We Want Electoral Reform
If you're disappointed like I am with the Liberals backing away from their promise of Electoral Reform, but know that you'll never actually get around to sending him a letter about it, join me. I want to send Trudeau hundreds - nay, THOUSANDS - of letters, but in order to do that I need some teamwork.
For each $2 donated, I will send AT LEAST one postcard on your behalf to Trudeau's office, letting him know that we are not happy with his decision to abandon his promise of electoral reform.
Here's what's going to happen:

I have designed a very simple postcard demanding that Trudeau be a leader and bring electoral reform to pass in Canada, as he was elected to do.
I will use all the money I receive from this campaign to print and send as many postcards as possible. I will not keep any money. If the total comes to an awkward amount, I'll chip in a little to round it out and send that last postcard.

I have currently priced them at $2 each, just to be safe, but I have a printing house that said they will give me 500 postcards for FREE, and will give me a 50% discount on printing after that. So basically, we're just paying postage, which means I can probably send TWO postcards per person.
UPDATE: I have just learned that we can mail the PM office for FREE, no postage needed. That means I will spend ALL THE MONEY on printing. This could wind up being a very large quantity, with the deal I got from the printer. How exciting!

The Postcards
The cards are very straightforward. I know there are a lot of different opinions on what kind of electoral reform we should have, so I'm not advocating for any particular system. We can stand as a united front asking for change.
Front:

Back:

Each card will include the name and postal code of the contributor, so that he can see it's not just one nut job sending him a gazillion postcards. You can also put a (SHORT) message in the notes of your order and I'll include it.
I will send out a survey to all funders at the end of the campaign requesting your message, if any!

The Impact
We're all cynical. I'm cynical. But dammit if I'm going to just sit back and say nothing! I don't care that the American president is a Sharknado of insanity - that is no excuse to sit back and do nothing to make my country better. 
Maybe Trudeau will continue to shy away from his promise, but at the very least we can let him know what we think.
Timing
The timeline is short on this, because I want to get things out ASAP. The minute this campaign is done, I will get the postcards to the printers and then get them out.
The only communication you will get from me is a picture of the printed postcards when they're done, and then me putting them in the mail.
Let's FLOOD HIS OFFICE WITH POSTCARDS! It will be just like that scene in Harry Potter where all the Hogwarts letters come through the chimney, but with far less magic.

<p>As the parents of small children, we often wonder what the most important skills will be for our children in the future. How can we help kids today adequately prepare for a fulfilling and successful life tomorrow? Several leading organizations and thinkers consider that “soft skills” will be instrumental in the future. Empathy, leadership, creativity, innovation, responsibility, teamwork – only some preschools and schools focus on teaching children these skills. Yellow Lark, the early education branch of the Waldorf school in Armenia, is one of these institutions. For more than 20 years, parents like us have trusted a critical period of their children’s development to this kindergarten. Throughout their work, the staff at Yellow Lark have involved the children in poetry and games that they have created themselves, with their expertise and experience in the balanced development of small children. Free play, songs and rhythm are core components in the Waldorf education system, which has, over several decades, been consistently producing children who are more creative, innovative, empathic and receptive than their peers from mainstream pre-schools and schools, both in Armenia and around the world. The staff at Yellow Lark have now compiled their songs and poems into a book, which will also develop the tactile senses of your child through its games. This book is a novelty in the Armenian market and offers a fresh, locally-produced alternative to the standard folk tales or foreign translations. That’s where the idea for the book was born – from the concerns of parents interested in new educational and fun material for children in Armenian. We want to help make this book a reality for our kids as well as Armenian children around the world. With your donation, this book can become a reality and help Armenian parents ensure greater holistic development for their children. Donate today or pre-order your copy of the book, and help us continue to produce generations of positive, creative and innovative children and youth!</p>

This beautiful picture was smashed by an angry troubled teen shouting, swearing and arguing with his Mum and she was giving it back in equal ferocity, and I thought what on earth went wrong.</p>
<p><strong>What we will do</strong></p>
<p>That was 11 years ago and I now have the answer - life kicks in. Since then we’ve co-created a unique personal development programme that can re-ignite that energetic connection. It’s been independently evaluated to transform families, empower children, save social services money and help teachers by changing behaviour in children. See 4 parents share their experiences of the course here <a href=""http://www.everyfamilymatters.org.uk/parent-champion"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.everyfamilymatters.org.uk/parent-champion</a></p>
<p>We now want to deliver a pilot programme in mainstream education where the teachers, pupils and parents work together to help young people from challenged backgrounds to discover their innate potential.</p>
<p><strong>Your contribution</strong></p>
<p>You will be contributing to a model that has the potential to change the fabric of our society and create a world where everyone’s potential is treasured. We help parents, by building self-esteem, emotional resilience and self-responsibility in themselves, and empower them to pass those skills onto their children. The next step is to change the culture of the learning environment to ensure its emphasis is on discovering a young person’s potential, in conjunction with their academic capability.</p>
<p>We need £6,000 to fund a pilot programme for 12 challenged families and supporting teachers over an 8-week period. We’ve proved working in groups is the most effective and efficient method, to maximise the impact of group energy. But if we don’t achieve our target, for every £500 raised we will work with one family in their school for 8 weeks. Or if we over achieve for every £500 unit we will add another family, WOW that could be awesome!!</p>
<p><strong>Why is this important?</strong></p>
<p>Because mainstream education doesn’t fit a large majority of young people who might be diagnosed ADHD, autistic, ‘learning difficulties’ etc. They have other talents, gifts and abilities not identified or used. Our unique combination of coaching and emotional literacy empowers the parent and their children to take responsibility for themselves to make different life choices.</p>
<p>Sir John Whitmore who introduced coaching to the UK over 30 years ago, warns of the need for a coaching approach for our future, in this video <a href=""http://www.everyfamilymatters.org.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.everyfamilymatters.org.uk</a>.  Whilst most parent/child support programmes work on the basis of a failing parent and the child needs ‘fixing’, our focus is on helping them see their strengths and then empowering them to create their own strategy for sustainability.</p>

This beautiful picture was smashed by an angry troubled teen shouting, swearing and arguing with his Mum and she was giving it back in equal ferocity, and I thought what on earth went wrong.
What we will do
That was 11 years ago and I now have the answer - life kicks in. Since then we’ve co-created a unique personal development programme that can re-ignite that energetic connection. It’s been independently evaluated to transform families, empower children, save social services money and help teachers by changing behaviour in children. See 4 parents share their experiences of the course here http://www.everyfamilymatters.org.uk/parent-champion
We now want to deliver a pilot programme in mainstream education where the teachers, pupils and parents work together to help young people from challenged backgrounds to discover their innate potential.
Your contribution
You will be contributing to a model that has the potential to change the fabric of our society and create a world where everyone’s potential is treasured. We help parents, by building self-esteem, emotional resilience and self-responsibility in themselves, and empower them to pass those skills onto their children. The next step is to change the culture of the learning environment to ensure its emphasis is on discovering a young person’s potential, in conjunction with their academic capability.
We need £6,000 to fund a pilot programme for 12 challenged families and supporting teachers over an 8-week period. We’ve proved working in groups is the most effective and efficient method, to maximise the impact of group energy. But if we don’t achieve our target, for every £500 raised we will work with one family in their school for 8 weeks. Or if we over achieve for every £500 unit we will add another family, WOW that could be awesome!!
Why is this important?
Because mainstream education doesn’t fit a large majority of young people who might be diagnosed ADHD, autistic, ‘learning difficulties’ etc. They have other talents, gifts and abilities not identified or used. Our unique combination of coaching and emotional literacy empowers the parent and their children to take responsibility for themselves to make different life choices.
Sir John Whitmore who introduced coaching to the UK over 30 years ago, warns of the need for a coaching approach for our future, in this video http://www.everyfamilymatters.org.uk.  Whilst most parent/child support programmes work on the basis of a failing parent and the child needs ‘fixing’, our focus is on helping them see their strengths and then empowering them to create their own strategy for sustainability.
We have proven the model works with challenged families and you can access the independent evidence here http://www.everyfamilymatters.org.uk/images/files/ParentChampion-Programme-Evaluation-April2013.pdf. Our next step is to prove it can work in mainstream education.

<p><b>Why should kids practice yoga?</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Children today have more pressure than ever!  Between school, home and other activities, they sometimes lose the ability to just be kids.  Yoga helps children find ways to ease their pressures and allows them to find themselves in a non-competitive atmosphere.  The benefits that children of all ages and abilities can obtain from regular yoga practice are inclusive of the same mind/body benefits that adults achieve. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Yoga…</p>
<ul>
<li>Develops flexibility, strength, stamina, agility, balance, and coordination </li>
<li>Helps with body awareness and sensory integration issues</li>
<li>Promotes concentration, self-discipline and develops inner strength and clarity</li>
<li>Builds cooperative skills and good social behaviors</li>
<li>Promotes positive communication and good listening skills which foster self-respect, compassion and respect for others</li>
<li>Builds self-confidence and self-trust in a non-competitive situation</li>
<li>Encourages creative imagination and self-expression</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>Yoga and mindfulness are essentially self-care tools and reflective approaches that support the holistic approach to human development by integrating social and emotional learning with healthy lifestyle habits. Secular in nature, contemplative approaches have the ability to support development of attention, creative problem-solving and insight, emotional self-regulation, empathy and compassionate action.</p>

<h2>If we haven't met!</h2>
<p>My name is Ayana Zaire Cotton and I am a junior at University of Maryland, College Park.  I am in the Individual Studies Program which allows students to create their own major.  I chose to develop the major ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_entrepreneurship"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Social Entrepreneurship</a>"" which emcompasses the process of learning how to pursue innovative solutions to social problems.</p>
<p>Also, I launched my start-up, Evlove (<a href=""www.shopevlove.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">shopevlove.com</a>), on March 1st and we've been making significant progress.  Evlove provides an online service that allows girls to get rid of their once loved clothes to acquire different ones using our virtual currency called “points”. While feedback thus far has been great and we are revenue generating, I realize there is still a lot to learn. </p>
<h2>What the Trip is for and Why I Have to Go</h2>
<p>My professor from last semester invited me to join a class he was teaching this fall, entitiled <strong>BMGT 478 - Building and Sustaining Competitive Advantages. </strong>Accompying this class is a trip to Seattle.  ""This course will include intensive interaction with industry experts. The experiential class will involve visiting companies in the Seattle and Portland area such as Amazon, Costco, Nike, Microsoft, Paccar, Intel, Freightliner, Nordstrom, Alaska Airlines, Starbucks, and Boeing.""</p>
<p>With me studying <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_entrepreneurship"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Social Entrepreneurship</a> this class would be an excellent addition to my cirrriculum.  Also, Evlove is an e-commerce site and I realize how competitive the retail industry is, so learning how these reputable companies build and sustain their competitive advantages would be nothing short of enlightening.  Don't believe me? Read further below and I'll let my professor give more details about the trip.</p>
<h2>What My Professor Has To Say About the Trip...</h2>
</div>
<h3>Here are a few exceprts from my professors email:</h3>
<p>""The reason for focusing on Pacific Northwest is that it is home to several major companies who use some of the most innovative management practices, particularly in supply chain management. More specifically, some companies in the region are deriving significant competitive advantage from their innovative management: Amazon through its unique distribution system, Boeing through lean operations and Just-in-Time concept, and Costco through its efficient logistics network. The experience provides students with unique insights regarding innovative management strategies.""</p>
<p>""The value of this experience is that you will be able to network with industry experts and you will be provided a valuable opportunity for direct exposure to companies that use innovative management strategies and supply chain management as a competitive advantage. The course challenges you to make connections between academic theory and real-world practice. This course will help you integrate concepts from your previous courses and gain valuable field experience by tackling actual business problems and opportunities facing one of the organizations we are visiting. This course benefits you by providing a dynamic learning environment for students that merges traditional education with practical experience.""The discussions and course material will be intertwined with what was discovered and discuss on the Seattle trip.""</p>
<p>""When you return to campus, you will investigate and develop solutions to real-world, real-time, complex challenges faced by one of the organizations that we visit. More specifically, this will involve working in student teams to work on projects with a client company to understand, analyze and solve their proposed business challenge""</p>

<h3>Hi Everyone!</h3>
<p>I'm Shantez Marie and I will be graduating from college on May 13th, 2013!!!! Great news right???</p>
<p>My problem is that I have no money for graduation fees, my cap and gown, any sashes, last minute fees, graduation outfit,..basically, I'm down on my luck right now!</p>
<p>I have been involuntarly <strong>unemployed</strong> for eight months and I have depleted my savings. I need some financial help in order to graduate successfully.</p>
<p>This campaign is important to me because I've worked so hard to get to this point only to be right at the end and I'm struggling with trying to walk across the stage. This is not for pity or sob stories. I'm excited and humbled to have completed this journey. But if I don't come up with the funds, then I won 't be able to walk across the stage come May. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am trying to raise around $600. This will cover all of my fees, cap and gown, graduation outfit, graduate school applications, and my CLEP tests so that I can finish the last five credit hours of my undergraduate career. And of course I have to pay IndieGogo!</p>
<p>If I don't make the goal entirely, the money will still go to my most immediate costs concerning graduation.</p>
<p>Best of all, you will see a deserving young woman be able to get her degree!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is bigger than just a good graduation experience for me. This will help me have hope for my future goals. I plan on getting my Ph.D before I'm 30. I have big plans in order to ""pass on the torch"" after I make it.</p>
<p>I want to be a Professor/Educator/Lawyer/Performance Artist in order to pass down the knowledge that I have learned. I've been through a lot in life and I want to help those who are struggling to make something of their lives just like me.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>IF YOU CANNOT CONTRIBUTE, please do pass this campaign on!!!! No hard feelings. I thank everyone for reading this and for sending positive energy my way.</p></div>","Hi Everyone!
I'm Shantez Marie and I will be graduating from college on May 13th, 2013!!!! Great news right???
My problem is that I have no money for graduation fees, my cap and gown, any sashes, last minute fees, graduation outfit,..basically, I'm down on my luck right now!
I have been involuntarly unemployed for eight months and I have depleted my savings. I need some financial help in order to graduate successfully.

<h3>The Mission</h3>
<h3>We Can not in our lifetime physically make enough herb stuff for everybody else, but we can help show everybody else what to do with herbs and what herbs are good for what. We have been gathering the info and recipes for this book for over 20 years from Appalachia to the Keewanau and Back.</h3>
<p>Living in an age of over regulation we feel that the knowledge of herbs for health and making simple herbal medicines for health may become lost. Having lived and herb farmed in the Appalachian mountains for over 25 years earlier in life the Authors were exposed to many old time ways with herbs that will soon be forgotten. We need your support to help us publish this homegrown mix of herbal folklore balanced with modern use as acknowledged by the UN and EU commissions on herbs. Along with the information you need to effectively process and use them at home.</p>
<p>After making these items as part of our liefstyle for over 25 years we have come to take for granted what most others do not know about, there are healing plants for many conditions right under our noses in gardens and weedbeds and forests and simple wasy to use them that could save lives in an emergency or hard times.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Authors</h3>
<p>The Authors Mike Hulbert and Anne Sangemino own Creation Herb Farm in Frankfort Michigan. They have been growing herbs and making tinctures, salves, infusions, teas, and may other herbal items as part of their daily lifestyle and rarely have needed to rely on conventional medicine for what ails them.</p>
<p>The authors have two previous works that were co-branded with Country Living magazine, Country Living's Handmade Soap , and Country Living Healthy Living's Pure Beauty, both hardbound printed by Hearst.</p>
<p>Our previous books were written under a publishing contract with a large publisher who then printed the books and moved on to the next to print and so on.</p>
<p>We need to self publish this book so that we will be free to distribute it the rest of our lives and pass it on. If we sell this to the big publishers it could be tabled or the copyright bought out and taken out of print by competitiors or pharmaceutical interests.</p>
<p>This Information needs to be available for future generations in laymans terms such as we live and talk so these traditions and herbal remedies can be passed down to the next generations.</p>
<p>Your contribution will help us finish editing and  producing the neccasary images and text for the printing press and allow us to have printed however many copies the funding project will allow us to print.</p>

<h2> </h2>
<h2>Project 1:  WIND GATEWAY</h2>
<p>Wind Gateway is a free, non-profit, online services platform specifically designed to help workers in the wind industry by providing skill sharing exchanges, personnel directories, search engines, and other career and job enhancement tools. </p>
<p>The services and information are available in four different languages and are provided absolutely free for wind industry workers no matter where they are in the world.   </p>
<p>In essence, Wind Gateway is a one-stop access point that allows front-line workers to network, exchange best practices, find a job, and communicate with each other so that they can improve their skills as well as the industry as a whole.  </p>
<p>This project is also an on-going research program in that its results (in terms of productivity, job security, value creation, personal enhancement and profitability) are regularly monitored so they can be adapted and used to help other industries.</p>
<p>The people involved with Wind Gateway include business promoters, sustainability educators, student interns and scholarship recipients from around the world.  In other words, this project and its affiliates are comprised of a unique blend of business professionals and pioneering academics, all of whom are dedicated to empowering the often overlooked men and women who work in the field (and front lines) while promoting renewable energy and sustainable business activity. </p>
<p>To view the (unfinished) website and learn more, visit: <a href=""http://www.windgateway.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.windgateway.com</a> (the information tabs are functioning)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How The Funding Will Be Used:</h3>
<p>Most of the website has been built by volunteers, but funding is now required to have specialists complete the final stages.  Additional funding is also needed (as always) to cover on-going expenses (e.g.: maintenance, server fees, upgrades, promotion costs, etc) and develop purpose-built support materials, generate instructional videos, and establish training and education programs.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Project 2:  RECONNAISSANCE SOFTWARE</h2>
<p>The creators of Wind Gateway have developed an easy-to-use software application (called: <em>Reconnaissance</em>) that is designed to simplify field work and help small businesses expand their role in the wind industry.</p>
<p>When downloaded into portable ‘rugged devices’ (also known as a ‘Personal Digital Assistants’ or PDA’s) and/or tablets or smartphones, the software - which can reduce inspection and report-writing times by two hours or more per turbine - enables the recording of data in both visual (e.g.: photograph and/or video) and written formats.</p>
<p>Anomalies, damage, and other important information are then automatically rendered into a professional report <em>as work is carried out</em>. If a mobile signal is available the information can be sent to a hosting site in real time for an on-the-spot analysis. If no link is available, the information can be stored and downloaded later.</p>
<p>After testing and verifying the effectiveness of the software, <em>Reconnaissance </em>software will be disseminated around the world for free on the Wind Gateway website to facilitate job security and job creation as well as optimize efficiency and generate long-term wealth and well-being in the wind industry.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How The Funding Will Be Used:</h3>
<p>The software has been completed and needs to be tested before it is distributed.  Funding is needed to send a team of student interns to several select businesses so that they can work with field operators, have the field workers look everything over and offer improvement suggestions, and then work with the application developers to make any changes and prepare the software for distribution.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Two grass-roots projects designed to:</li>
</ul><p>            -facilitate job security (and job creation),</p>
<p>            -foster business growth,</p>
<p>            -raise industry standards, and,</p>
<p>            -help field workers boost their skills and careers.</p>
<ul>
<li>To date, over 20 volunteers from 9 different countries have contributed their time and skills.</li>
<li>And all for the purpose of helping to create a more sustainable future for humanity and the renewable energy sector.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>(It is envisioned that these projects will also help provide a ‘gateway’ into the wind industry for women, ex-service people, entrepreneurs, engineers and others.) </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Donors that contribute $25 or more will have their name (or the name of their organization) added onto the donors list on the 'People' page of the Wind Gateway website.  This list will be permanently displayed after the campaign ends.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>Donors wishing to make a substantial contribution are welcome to negotiate long-term recognition on the website (perhaps in the form of a footer/banner or other prominent display).</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Governance and Accountability</strong></h3>
<p>Both Wind Gateway and Reconnaissance software fall under the umbrella of the <strong>Center for Industrial Productivity and Sustainability (CIPS)</strong>, a non-profit, education-based organization dedicated to the advancement of learning and the development of long-term thinking and sustainable practices.  The purpose of CIPS is to benefit businesses, academia, industry and the general public through education and relevance, tool-creation, barrier elimination, action and support, and fraternity – otherwise defined as:</p>
<ol>
<li>the research, integration, and promotion of responsible, profitable, and sustainable business practices,</li>
<li>creating and freely distributing information that advances long-term wealth generation, job creation, waste elimination, resource maximization and the minimization of environmental degradation,</li>
<li>fostering communication between business communities and academia,</li>
<li>strengthening businesses, business communities and industries by helping to develop individual capabilities, competencies, skills and understanding, and,</li>
<li>working in conjunction with similar, reputable organizations to accomplish the above.</li>
</ol><p> </p>
<p>The methods CIPS uses to achieve its mission and aims include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the production and distribution of free educational materials (e.g.: tools and videos) for academia and businesses, </li>
<li>waste assessment information and training materials, </li>
<li>the development of projects that facilitate job security and creation, and,</li>
<li>the collection and distribution of funds forscholarships and research.   </li>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Έναν αιώνα μετά επαναξιολογούμε την στιγμή αυτή: τις ελπίδες που γέννησε και τις δυνατότητες που φανέρωσε, την τελική της ήττα και την δυστοπική της εξέλιξη.</p>

In mid-2018 we began to unite. We were academics, researchers, politically active citizens. The aim of our union? To study and think upon the greatest revolutionary attempt in modern history: the Russian revolution.
A century later we re-evaluate this moment: the hopes it raised and the possibilities it opened up, its ultimate defeat and its dystopian progress.
It did not take long to turn this study circle into a large international conference on these matters.
We seek dispassionate conclusions through new, out-of-the-box perspectives. That’s why we invited leading academics from Russian, Greek, British, German, Swiss and Italian universities, with many years of archival research behind them.

Συναντηθήκαμε στα μέσα του 2018. Ήμασταν πανεπιστημιακοί, ερευνητές και ενεργοί πολιτικά άνθρωποι. Σκοπός της συνάντησης; Η μελέτη και ο στοχασμός γύρω από την μεγαλύτερη επαναστατική απόπειρα στην σύγχρονη ιστορία: την Ρωσική επανάσταση.
Έναν αιώνα μετά επαναξιολογούμε την στιγμή αυτή: τις ελπίδες που γέννησε και τις δυνατότητες που φανέρωσε, την τελική της ήττα και την δυστοπική της εξέλιξη.
Πολύ σύντομα ο κύκλος μελέτης έδωσε την θέση του σε ένα μεγάλο διεθνές συνέδριο για τα ζητήματα αυτά.
Αναζητούμε νηφάλια συμπεράσματα μέσα από νέες προοπτικές που κινούνται εκτός πεπατημένης. Γι’ αυτό και προσκαλέσαμε καταξιωμένους πανεπιστημιακούς από ανώτατα εκπαιδευτικά ιδρύματα της Ρωσίας, της Ελλάδας, του Ηνωμένου Βασιλείου, της Γερμανίας, της Ελβετίας και της Ιταλίας· ανθρώπους με πολλά χρόνια αρχειακής έρευνας πίσω τους.
Αποδέχτηκαν την πρόσκλησή μας και το συνέδριο θα γίνεις στις 12-14 Απριλίου στην Νομική Σχολή Αθηνών.
Είμαστε πολύ περήφανοι για ό,τι πετύχαμε ώς τώρα! Φυσικά, ένα συνέδριο αυτού του μεγέθους δεν μπορεί παρά να έχει ένα ορισμένο κόστος: μετακινήσεις και φιλοξενίες, ζωντανές μεταφράσεις για το σύνολο του κοινού καθώς και την μελλοντική έκδοση των πρακτικών του συνεδρίου.
Με χαρά σού ανακοινώνουμε ότι αδυνατούμε να καλύψουμε εξ ολοκλήρου το κόστος αυτό. Μάλιστα, σωστά διάβασες! ΜΕ ΧΑΡΑ.
Αν τα οικονομικά μας ήταν καλύτερα, δεν θα μπορούσαμε να απευθυνθούμε σ’ εσένα. Δεν θα μπορούσαμε να σου δώσουμε μια γεύση του τι μπορεί να χρηματοδοτήσει ένα πλήθος, του τι μπορεί να πετύχει μια κοινότητα ανδρών και γυναικών χωρίς καμμία άλλη βοήθεια.
Δεν θα μπορούσαμε να σου δώσουμε την ευκαιρία να συνδημιουργήσεις μια σπουδαία εκδήλωση.
Πιθανώς ψάχνεις για ιστορικά αίτια. Ίσως ελπίζεις να βρεις πολιτικά διδάγματα. Ενδεχομένως είσαι ένας νοσταλγικός κομμουνιστής, ένας απογοητευμένος δημοκράτης, ή απλά ένας παθιασμένος ιστορικός.
Ξέρουμε ότι κατανοείς το μέτρο της αξίας και των δυσκολιών της πρωτοβουλίας μας.
Βοήθησέ μας!
Και έλα ύστερα στο συνέδριο· να δεις με τα μάτια σου τι χρηματοδότησες – ή, όπως θα έλεγε ένας Ρώσος επαναστάτης, πώς η ποσότητα γίνεται ποιότητα.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Life of a Street Kid in Brazil</h3>
<p>What's it like to be 5 years old and have to rummage through waste to get your next meal? What's it like to be 5 years old and have to ride on the bus by yourself to go downtown and beg for change? What's it like when your parents are the ones who put you on the bus? What's it like to be a child going to sleep on the streets, not knowing if you'll wake up in the morning, or if you'll be attacked in the night by a rival gang, or worse, by the police? What's it like to be a child and have the armed military police as your worst enemy? What's it iike to have hundreds of adults reject you every day? What's it like?</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><em>14 million kids in Brazil know all too well what it's like.</em></p>

<h3>The Hephzibah Project</h3>
<p>We are laucnhing the Hephzibah Project to reach out specifically to the street kids in Brazil.  We are a Christian ministry, but we are inviting all people to help support this project. The first phase of this project will include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Establishing Relationships with the the Orphanages and local organizations that are currently addressing the issue.</li>
<li>Visit orphans in their need.</li>
<li>Survey a plot of land that has been donated to us by the state to one day build a group home.</li>
<li>Raise awareness about the Human Trafficking industry in Brazil.</li>
<li>Mobilize anti-human trafficking prayer and prevention teams for the World Cup next year.</li>
<li>Make arrangements to take a team on a short term missions trip for June of next year.</li>
<li>Develop our message by getting stories and capturing footage and photos</li>
</ol>
<p>We have an amazing opportunity in November 2013 to go to the city of Porto Alegre, Brazil and carry out the first phase of this project.  In order to do it we need <strong>$6000</strong>.  The rough breakdown of the costs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>$1700 airfair (two passengers. we got a donation in flyer miles that saved us $700)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$1000 accomodations, transportation, and food (2 guys for 2 weeks)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$800 to launch our new website</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$2000 to obtain our non-profit status</p>
</li>
<li>$500 indiegogo fee if we reach our goal (Approx).</li>
</ul>
<p>Anything given above what we need for phase 1 will go towards phase 2 of the Hephzibah Project.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Who We Are</strong></h3>
<p>We are Danny and Flavio, two life-long Brazilian-American friends.  We're both in full time ministry and Danny is married with 5 children, while Flavio is married with 4 children.  In 2011, Danny's cousin who was raised on the streets in Brazil was murdered when his car was set on fire by a rival gang with him sleeping in it. Since then, a real sense of urgency came over both of us as we asked the question, ""Why are we so blessed, yet we have family in Brazil that isn't?"" Now we feel compelled to give back to our parents' home country.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Co-Labor With Us!</h3>
<p>We believe that those who contribute financially are equal partners with those who go out and do the work.  Together we can accomplish what we couldn't have done seperately.  You can play an indispensable role in the life of a child who tonight will be trembeling with fear over what he or she will have to do for money, or where to sleep.  Help us help them.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Create Some Buzz</h3>
<p>You can also help us by spreading the word about what we are doing.  Share this campaign with your friends on social media, at work, church, and other gatherings.  Your personal endorsement of this project helps those in your sphere of influence get excited about it as well.</p>

includes numerous opera suites, which are shortened versions of well known
operas, including the staging and orchestration. There will be one
fully-staged opera as well as several orchestral performances. In addition,
there are several opportunities to play chamber music with other students from
all over the world. At the same time, the students create the music in a
setting that produced many wonderful musicians over the course of the last
several centuries. It is an excellent opportunity for students to experience
the history of music making first hand -- in the center of Italy -- in Rome.</span></p><p></p></span><p></p>

attend this program, they return to the United States with renewed enthusiasm
for their music studies. As an added bonus, the students return with the gifts
of confidence, maturity, and travel and music experience. This program is
unique in that students will live in Rome in the heart of history, among
priceless art works and treasure, and experience first hand the historical
significance of Italy's contribution to the world of music, art, science, and
philosophy.</span></p><p></p></span><p></p>

raising funds to cover the cost of the tuition and have started this campaign

experience for young students. The program offers something for orchestral
players, instrumentalists, vocalists, and dancers. I have ten students who wish
to attend the program in summer 2014.
The program
includes numerous opera suites, which are shortened versions of well known
operas, including the staging and orchestration. There will be one
fully-staged opera as well as several orchestral performances. In addition,
there are several opportunities to play chamber music with other students from
all over the world. At the same time, the students create the music in a
setting that produced many wonderful musicians over the course of the last
several centuries. It is an excellent opportunity for students to experience
the history of music making first hand -- in the center of Italy -- in Rome.
When students
attend this program, they return to the United States with renewed enthusiasm
for their music studies. As an added bonus, the students return with the gifts
of confidence, maturity, and travel and music experience. This program is
unique in that students will live in Rome in the heart of history, among
priceless art works and treasure, and experience first hand the historical
significance of Italy's contribution to the world of music, art, science, and
philosophy.
The Rome
Festival orchestra is an experience that cannot be duplicated anywhere other
than in Rome.
 
What We
Need & What You Get
The 10 students
are hard at work raising funds through their community in order to cover the
costs of the program tuition (about $5,000) and the cost of travel and food
during the three-week program (about $3,000). I would like to join them in
raising funds to cover the cost of the tuition and have started this campaign
to raise the funds for scholarships to defray the tuition costs. Any funds I
raise will go to fund the students' travel expenses, outstanding tuition, and
living expenses while in Rome.
I will be using
the funds to set up the travel arrangements for the students as a group. I will
also attend the summer festival, although I will be funding my own way
separately from the students' funding.
Even if we are
unable to raise enough funds for everyone, we will still use the funds for the
purposes that I have stated above. If we do not raise all the funds that we
need, then someone will have to remain at home, but I am confident that we will
be able to meet our goal.
I have
personally interviewed, selected, and invited those students who showed the
most promise of thoroughly enjoying and learning from the Rome Festival
experience. These students have shown a learning attitude, a willingness to
work, and a desire to share this exciting adventure in music education.
We hope to
provide you with thank you gestures for your contributions, including major
shout-outs on Facebook or other social media sites. If you are a very generous
supporter (over $1,000), I will offer you an opportunity to adopt one of the students. The student will contact you and provide you with interesting updates about their progress toward the Rome trip, as well as details of the trip itself. If you offer $500-999, I will provide an opportunity for you to hear the students
perform.
  
Other
Ways You Can Help
I understand if you are unable to
help us monetarily. Your friendship and good will are still welcome. Help us
spread the word about our campaign to raise these funds for the 2014 Rome
Festival Orchestra program. If you have any other ideas about raising the funds
or spreading the word about our needs, please let me know. Be sure to share our

What started as a collaboration between three community organizations - Big Thought, bcWORKSHOP, and Dallas Public Libraries – to build an initial network of 20 Little Free Libraries, has inspired people across the Dallas-Fort Worth area to join the cause. Cheerios and Little Free Library® want your help to support this grassroots effort—to improve literacy and build stronger communities—by helping them raise enough funds to put up an additional 50 Little Free Libraries throughout the Dallas-Fort Worth area!Cheerios™ believes that when people
come together, anything is possible. That’s why, when we saw that
extraordinary individuals were joining together to improve
literacy by establishing a network of Little Free Libraries across the Dallas-Fort Worth area, we just had to cheer them on and help invest in their efforts!
Why Little Free Libraries
When children make reading an everyday activity, they not only
unleash their imagination — they establish a lifelong love of learning. Our
hope is to increase literacy and inspire young dreamers by building Little Free
Libraries across Dallas-Fort Worth neighborhoods.

and Fort Worth.

During that time, I had the chance to meet a young man named Phillipo. This incredibly hard-working teenager immediately stood out to me. In a place like Tanzania, where the education system discourages critical thinking and promotes a ""repeat what I say"" methodology, Phillipo has somehow managed to come forth a strong, independent-minded, and extremely intelligent young man. </p>
<p>On his own initiative, Phillipo applied and auditioned for a music scholarship at the <a href=""http://www.arusha.braeburn.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Braeburn International School</a> in Arusha, Tanzania. He found out about this opportunity very last-minute and had only one day to prepare the music he would perform.

</div></div>","Short Summary My name is Danielle Williams and I worked in Arusha Tanzania with the Umoja Music School from 2011-2013 teaching piano, flute, and voice. During that time, I had the chance to meet a young man named Phillipo. This incredibly hard-working teenager immediately stood out to me. In a place like Tanzania, where the education system discourages critical thinking and promotes a ""repeat what I say"" methodology, Phillipo has somehow managed to come forth a strong, independent-minded, and extremely intelligent young man. 
On his own initiative, Phillipo applied and auditioned for a music scholarship at the Braeburn International School in Arusha, Tanzania. He found out about this opportunity very last-minute and had only one day to prepare the music he would perform. Astoundingly, (though not as much to those of us who know Phillipo) he passed the audition and was granted an 85% scholarship. 
This opportunity will change Phillipo's life. It will provide him with world-class teachers, allow him to take courses in the advanced sciences and aviation that he is so interested in, will give him opportunities to again study music, take piano lessons, and perform with peers who will challenge and inspire him. The school will help him to prepare for international standard exams like the SATs, allowing him to apply to the top universities in Africa, Europe, and USA.  
Yet Phillipo comes from a family of 5 children and his parents and brothers struggle to pay even the Tanzanian Government School fees. In order for Phillipo to attend the International school, $3,100 (the other 15%) must still be paid.    What We Need & What You Get Here are the costs to attend the school:
$12,340/year for tuition
$300/year -- the amount Phillipo's family will contribute to his education
$2,000/year-- Remaining cost of tuition NOT covered in scholarship 
$500/year-- activity fee NOT covered in scholarship 
$600/year-- transport and food NOT covered in scholarship

Total needed to fund: $2,800
  Risks & Challenges I am now based back in the USA, but visited Tanzania and Phillipo just before he auditioned for the scholarship. The distance and delay in communication certainly prove to be inconveniences when working and handling money between USA and Tanzania, but I am in good communication with the head of the International School as well as my previous organization, Umoja Music School so as to facilitate clear and quick communication about Phillipo, his schooling, and financials.

<p>Join us in changing lives. Cloud Peak helps students from low-income
families go to top colleges, graduate with the lowest debt possible, and
sometimes graduate with no debt at all.  </p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>In 2014-2015, all 16 Cloud Peak students were
offered admission to a top college.</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>The average family income was under $30,000 per
year.</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>The average scholarship and financial aid for
each student was more than $228,000 over four years, or more than $3.3 million
total.</p>
<p><b>Why we need your
donation. </b>Cloud Peak pays all expenses for the college application process.
Your donation will fund the 20 students we work with this fall.  </p>
<p>Cloud Peak is staffed by volunteers. We need to raise $1200
per student to pay for our costs. We pay
for test prep books and provide our test coaching, and pay test fees that aren’t
covered by fee waivers. We transmit the test scores to colleges. We pay for
some application fees that can’t be waived. We will assist with other expenses
when strictly necessary on a case by case basis, like helping a student pay
part of the cost of a visit to a college or an interview.  Additionally, we have a budget to pay for winter
clothing and linens for students who can’t afford those items when they start
their first year of college.  We’d like
to give each student a laptop computer, but we’re not there yet.</p>
<p>If we raise more than $25,000, we will use that money for
next year’s students and to expand Cloud Peak to reach our eventual goal of
serving 200 students per year.</p>
<p><b>What we do</b>. We
work with high achieving students from low-income families and help them
through the college admission process. </p>
<p>We provide free, one-to-one coaching through weekly meetings
so that every Cloud Peak student succeeds in the college application process. We
help our students complete eight to twelve applications. This coaching also
focuses on improving standardized test scores on the SAT, ACT, and SAT Subject
Tests. We also provide intensive writing instruction for the application essays
with a team of volunteer writing mentors who have worked or currently work as
professional writers or teachers. We educate students and their families about
the opportunities available at the best colleges in the country and help
students decide where they will apply. 
We do not provide scholarships, but assist students in obtaining the
best scholarships and financial aid available.</p>
<p>Cloud Peak coaches over the telephone and Internet, so we
can work with students living anywhere in the United States. Our students for
2016 live in Lee County, Collier County, and Palm Beach County, Florida;
Brooklyn, New York, and Newark, New Jersey. We want to serve more students in
those cities and towns, as well as students in new places.</p>
<p><b>Success in
admissions. </b>Last year, sixteen Cloud Peak students applied to college. All
sixteen received offers of admission to top colleges and universities,
including Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Emory, Johns Hopkins, M.I.T.,
Princeton, Stanford, the University of Florida, and Amherst, Bryn Mawr, Barnard,
Colgate, Grinnell, Harvey Mudd, Macalester, Middlebury, Olin, and Swarthmore.</p>
<p><b>Successful track
record in college. </b>Cloud Peak began with one student in 2009 who now works
as a computer professional after completing a computer science degree at
Swarthmore. Every student who has elected to attend a selective private college
remains in college or has graduated. We have worked with more than 70 students,
including 20 students who are applying to college this year.</p>
<p><b>How do we find
students? </b>We establish ongoing relationships with teachers and guidance
counselors in high schools that serve low-income students. These professionals
help us select talented and ambitious students.</p>
<p><b>The main challenges
and obstacles for Cloud Peak. </b>There’s a vast pool of talented students from
low-income families who are highly qualified for admission to the best colleges
in the country. They often do not know about the opportunities, or they don’t
know how to get there by themselves. Cloud Peak’s mission is to identify these
students and get them into top colleges.</p>

covered by fee waivers. We transmit the test scores to colleges. We pay for
some application fees that can’t be waived. We will assist with other expenses
when strictly necessary on a case by case basis, like helping a student pay
part of the cost of a visit to a college or an interview.  Additionally, we have a budget to pay for winter
clothing and linens for students who can’t afford those items when they start
their first year of college.  We’d like
to give each student a laptop computer, but we’re not there yet.
If we raise more than $25,000, we will use that money for
next year’s students and to expand Cloud Peak to reach our eventual goal of
serving 200 students per year.
What we do. We
work with high achieving students from low-income families and help them
through the college admission process. 
We provide free, one-to-one coaching through weekly meetings
so that every Cloud Peak student succeeds in the college application process. We
help our students complete eight to twelve applications. This coaching also
focuses on improving standardized test scores on the SAT, ACT, and SAT Subject
Tests. We also provide intensive writing instruction for the application essays
with a team of volunteer writing mentors who have worked or currently work as
professional writers or teachers. We educate students and their families about
the opportunities available at the best colleges in the country and help
students decide where they will apply. 
We do not provide scholarships, but assist students in obtaining the
best scholarships and financial aid available.
Cloud Peak coaches over the telephone and Internet, so we
can work with students living anywhere in the United States. Our students for
2016 live in Lee County, Collier County, and Palm Beach County, Florida;
Brooklyn, New York, and Newark, New Jersey. We want to serve more students in
those cities and towns, as well as students in new places.
Success in
admissions. Last year, sixteen Cloud Peak students applied to college. All
sixteen received offers of admission to top colleges and universities,
including Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Emory, Johns Hopkins, M.I.T.,
Princeton, Stanford, the University of Florida, and Amherst, Bryn Mawr, Barnard,
Colgate, Grinnell, Harvey Mudd, Macalester, Middlebury, Olin, and Swarthmore.
Successful track
record in college. Cloud Peak began with one student in 2009 who now works
as a computer professional after completing a computer science degree at
Swarthmore. Every student who has elected to attend a selective private college
remains in college or has graduated. We have worked with more than 70 students,
including 20 students who are applying to college this year.
How do we find
students? We establish ongoing relationships with teachers and guidance
counselors in high schools that serve low-income students. These professionals
help us select talented and ambitious students.
The main challenges
and obstacles for Cloud Peak. There’s a vast pool of talented students from
low-income families who are highly qualified for admission to the best colleges
in the country. They often do not know about the opportunities, or they don’t
know how to get there by themselves. Cloud Peak’s mission is to identify these
students and get them into top colleges.
Please contribute to help us achieve our mission. Even if
you cannot contribute, please get the word out! Share what we do on your social
media networks and by using the Indiegogo share tools. Got to our website: www.cloudpeak.org, or like our Facebook

I am raising money to spend this summer teaching English in rural Ecuador with The Village Education Project (VEP).
 
The Village Education Project is a non-profit that provides a comprehensive education program for students in the rural highlands outside of Otavalo, Ecuador.  Because of the schools' matriculation fees and the high cost of uniforms and school books, only 1 in 10 students in the impoverished rural areas of Ecuador receive a high school education. VEP provides full scholarships for students in the villages they work in so those students can attend high school for free. But this is not enough.  By the time they are ready to attend high school, most of these students are behind in their studies.  
 
That's where us volunteers come in.  Each year, volunteers come from across the United States to catch the students up in the areas where they need it the most: English, math, and computer skills.  The volunteers are led by Ecuadorian educators on the ground, so the lessons that the volunteers give are consistent with what the students will learn when they start high school.
 
Volunteers also help VEP fund the students' scholarships.  Each volunteer is required to raise a minimum of $500.  100% of this money goes to paying for the students to attend high school.  Because it only costs about $200 to send one student to school per year, just by going to Ecuador, I will make it possible for almost three students to go to school.  
 
In addition to the $500 I need for this scholarship, I need to raise money for my flight and luggage ($1,300), my living expenses ($1,050) and out of the country medical Insurance for two months ($84). I was awarded a Community Service Scholarship when I attended Oberlin College that gives a living stipend. This will cover $2,000 of the cost (YAAAYY!), which helps me a lot, but I'm still in need of your help!
 
The total minimum amount that I need for the trip is:
500+1300+1050+84= 2934
2934-2000= 934

This site charges 4% if I reach my goal so the magic number is $973.
 
If I exceed my goal, I can use that as means to fund other things I need while in Ecuador, in addition to donating that money to VEP to help even more students go to high school.

<p>In May, 2013, I will embark upon a journey that I have been planning and preparing for my entire life. I have been accepted into a doctoral (Ph.D.) program in Clinical Social Work at Smith College in Northampton, MA. It feels like a dream!</p>
<p>Many of you already know that I have dedicated my life and my career to ensuring access to health/mental health services for historically marginalized and disenfranchised people, many of whom come from communities of color and who, without such support, would never receive the care that they rightfully deserve.</p>
<p>I have been honored by being accepted into this program, which will allow me to further my education and training to continue to serve as an advocate, mentor, leader, role model, therapist and woman warrior to continue the fight for equality in health and mental health service delivery.</p>
<p>As a long-time social worker and therapist, I have reaped the benefits of being rich in empathy and compassion for others, rich in friendship, rich in spirit, rich in community, yet not rich with money. For my goal to be realized, I turn to my broader community and ask for your help.</p>
<p>When I first decided to do this ask of my community, I found myself filled with shame and embarrassment at the thought that I couldn't ""do this myself."" After speaking with a close friend, however, she assured me that people ""want to help those who help themselves, and who dedicate their lives to helping others."" This is exactly who I am, what I represent and what I plan to do with my degree.</p>
<p>This educational opportunity allows me to not only share my own voice, but to continue to work toward the empowerment of the voiceless, and to bring their stories to the table.</p>
<p>For those of you who know me personally, you know that I am a representative of numerous historically oppressed populations myself. I am African-American, I am a woman, I am a lesbian, I am a child of divorce, I am a formerly obese person, and I am also the daughter and sister of incarcerated African-American males. Fortunately, I am also the daughter of a UC Berkeley graduate, who long ago planted the seeds of education in my heart and mind and instilled in me the value of ""each one teach one.""</p>
<p>I cannot express enough how much your contribution toward my education will mean to me. You will not only be helping me to achieve my dream, you will be helping me to help others achieve theirs.</p>
<p>For me, the actual dollar amount of your contribution isn't what is significant. What matters to me most is the loving support of my community.....of people who are willing to step up for something that they see as a worthy cause, to say ""yes"" to education, to personal, emotional and spiritual growth and to the empowerment of others. </p>
<p>What I'm hoping to receive through this campaign is support toward the almost $30,000 per year tuition and dorm fees that this endeavor will cost.....the travel expense to and from Massachusetts, the upgraded technology that is needed, the books, food, coin laundry, general transportation, and maybe, just maybe, an occasional cup of coffee for those all-nighters!! Going to school is downright expensive!!</p>
<p>Many of you are probably already screaming right now, ""WHAT!!! IS SHE CRAZY??"" The answer is absolutely YES! I'm just crazy enough to think that I can be accepted into a private institution of higher learning and that with the support of my community, we can make it happen.</p>
<p>Your contribution will ABSOLUTELY make a difference......no matter how small! And, if by chance you are not able to help financially at this time, there are other ways that you can help:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>You can get the word out to your friends and make some noise about my campaign</li>
<li>Share the website with them, tell them my story and remind them to share it with others</li>
<li>Post the link on your social networks so that others who may be interested in helping can find the campaign</li>
<li>Use the Indiegogo share tools to Spread The Word to others!!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>And that’s all there is to it.</p>
<p>I thank each and every one of you, from the bottom of my heart, for your contribution. Your support truly means the world to me, and will allow me to not only fulfill my dream, it will continue to allow me to offer the highest level of care and support to the children, adults and families that I am committed to serving.</p>
<p>Peace and Blessings to you all!</p>

What I'm hoping to receive through this campaign is support toward the almost $30,000 per year tuition and dorm fees that this endeavor will cost.....the travel expense to and from Massachusetts, the upgraded technology that is needed, the books, food, coin laundry, general transportation, and maybe, just maybe, an occasional cup of coffee for those all-nighters!! Going to school is downright expensive!!
Many of you are probably already screaming right now, ""WHAT!!! IS SHE CRAZY??"" The answer is absolutely YES! I'm just crazy enough to think that I can be accepted into a private institution of higher learning and that with the support of my community, we can make it happen.
Your contribution will ABSOLUTELY make a difference......no matter how small! And, if by chance you are not able to help financially at this time, there are other ways that you can help:


You can get the word out to your friends and make some noise about my campaign
Share the website with them, tell them my story and remind them to share it with others
Post the link on your social networks so that others who may be interested in helping can find the campaign
Use the Indiegogo share tools to Spread The Word to others!!


And that’s all there is to it.
I thank each and every one of you, from the bottom of my heart, for your contribution. Your support truly means the world to me, and will allow me to not only fulfill my dream, it will continue to allow me to offer the highest level of care and support to the children, adults and families that I am committed to serving.
Peace and Blessings to you all!

</h3>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Short Summary</span></h3>
<p>I've been sewing since I was 7 years old, and I've been interested in international development since I was a teenager. I discovered an organization called Empower Women and Africa and found that they asked donors to make reusable cloth menstrual pads to give to schoolgirls in Africa. I thought this would be a perfect project for me. But I've discovered that it is costing more money than I can personally invest, which is why I need your help.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need $500 to make 200 Empowerment Kits. An Empowerment Kit contains 3 resuable cloth menstrual pads, 9 liners, a cotton storage bag, a pair of underwear, safety pins, and a plastic zip top bag. The supplies I purchase for the sewing portion of this project are flannel, PUL, thread, metal snaps, cotton, and twill tape. With an investment of $500, I'll be able to buy many of these in bulk.<br/><br/>With a donation of $20, you'll receive a handmade cosmetics bag.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Research has shown us that resources for education, particularly education for girls, is the best investment we can make in the developing world. Education creates sustainable change and growth in the human economy. Many girls are unable to attend school for a week out of every month because they don't have access to menstrual products, which often ultimately leads to them dropping out early. The one simple task of supplying them with these products keeps them in school.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute financially, share my page through Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest, Email, text message, carrier pigeon, whatever you can. Help me get the word out to as many people as possible so I can reach my goal of $500.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Many remedial college students and GED candidates struggle to make ends meet, and simply cannot afford to hire a private tutor. For many of these students, the remedial classroom is overcrowded and instructors are overextended. Consequently, many have to retake the same remedial classes, sometimes two or three times, often leading to crippling student debt.</p>
<p>I've taught and tutored mathematics and computer science for over a decade. I recently left my teaching positions at City University of New York to focus on expanding my private tutoring business. As part of this expansion, I intend to offer students in need an opportunity to take a remedial class, in a small classroom setting of no more than 10 students at a time, <strong>at no charge to the student.</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Since textbooks are outrageously expensive, I will be generating all necessary course materials and providing them to the students at no charge. I need funding to cover the cost of printing, supplies, and possibly space.</p>
<p>I also need funding to cover my meager cost of living as I work on this project. My partner is employed full-time, but my decision to leave my job to work on this has meant a decrease in our income. That will change as my business grows, and the work I'm doing to expand my business should help cover the cost of this project in the long run. However, Summer is a difficult time for private tutors, and your donation will help get this project going sooner rather than later.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You will be providing a low-income student with a valuable opportunity they wouldn't be able to afford otherwise. In this economy, the need for free, quality remedial math education is great. This is a way to make a real, positive impact in the life of those who need it.</p>

Experiences That Have Shaped Me:
I have served on student councils
since sixth grade, with a year as vice-president of our City-Wide Student
Government, and participated in statewide Model UN and Model Assembly Programs. I also had the
opportunity, through a Minneapolis work training program, to apply for and be
accepted as an intern for U.S. Congressman Keith Ellison last summer. That
experience gave me an inside look at the American political system.  I have overcome challenges and grown along the way - with the divorce of
my parents several years ago, and with my dyslexia
bringing myself to an A/B average in school.I work at a popular community
movie theatre, have saved money since I was very young and used much of it to invest in the stock
market. I am also in the process of selling most of that to help fund this exciting trip.I have an optimistic and
ambitious attitude toward life, and have a strong commitment to serving my
community. I am also keenly interested in understanding the national and global challenges that
face my generation now and in the decades to come. 
Why This Program is Important to Me:


The opportunity to work
alongside farmers and community leaders, teachers, and medical workers [in
Ecuador, Thailand, India, and South Africa] will bring an amazing service
opportunity to exercise body, heart and mind.  Additionally, our interactive group study and
learning will provide us with an understanding of these
challenging global issues.(For more details about the trip, click on the Updates tab above the video).
Your important contribution will support:

·  Hands-on service work with those who face these issues on a day to day basis.·  Preparing me to offer more informed
solutions to these pressing global issues.
·  A
program preparing young leaders for our shared global future. 
·   Making this amazing opportunity possible for me.You may donate any amount you choose or pick from the Perks on the right.Please help us get the word out  to anyone you think might be interested by using the Share Tools below the video.                                   Thank you,

Sticks It to Cancer (by helping her raise $6650)!</b></p>
<p>Sam is already a success. An all-round fantastic
person, friend, girlfriend and colleague, she’s overcome the challenges of
growing up in the foster-care system, graduated university and now works to
make things better for kids who have also grown up without their families. As
her friend, I’ve admired her strength and spirit, and how well she can overcome
anything that gets in her way. This is what makes her recent cancer diagnosis
so difficult to fathom.  It’s just so strange
to see her face something she can’t fix—at least, not without some help.</p>
<p>Sam has an extremely rare malignant brain
tumor, which she discovered after experiencing sudden blurry vision. There is a
precise, medical term for it (“Intracranial Chondrosarcoma”); basically she’s
got a big, scary, jerk of a lump lodged between a rock, a hard place and her near
her brain stem, and she needs surgery and radiation ASAP. Because of its
serious nature, Sam’s surgery has been fast-tracked and will be scheduled for June 10 (her brain surgeon normally has a 2 year waiting list).</p>
<p><b>Where
we come in:</b></p>
<p>Thankfully, the wonderful Canadian medical
system will cover the surgery, but because of it’s tricky location near the
brain stem, the surgeon won’t be able to get it all out and she’ll need special
radiation treatment. Her type of tumor is so rare that she’ll need to relocate
California for a month to receive special proton radiation therapy. Travel,
accommodation and medication (in addition to hefty, on-going student loan
payments and rent) all add up to much, much more than someone on unpaid medical
leave from a non-profit job can afford—especially someone who doesn’t have the support
that many of us can look to during health crises. </p>
<p>I believe Sam will be successful with this
treatment—the prognosis is good with proton radiation, and it’s just not Sam’s
style not to be. The difficult reality is that, without a little help, this
treatment will not be possible. </p>
<p><b>What
can you do?</b></p>
<p>1.<span> 
</span><b>Share this page (it’s free!):</b> the more
shares that her profile gets the higher up she moves on the website. So when
people are looking to donate to a cause they will see Sam’s profile and give
her all the money!</p>
<p>2.<span> 
</span><b>Share your paycheck!: </b>If you have the
means—whether $5 or $500—every bit you can contribute will help make this very
necessary treatment a reality. </p>
<p>3.<span> 
</span><b>Share Sam’s story with your community!: </b>Whether
your community means sports teams, religious affiliations or coworkers, tell
them how awesome Sam is and how donating even $2-$5 could be life altering for
Sam (literally). </p>
<p>Join us as we all help Sam
show this big, scary jerk of a lump who’s boss. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>With
love and gratitude, </b></p>
<p><b>Lisa
&amp; Friends</b></p>
<p><b>Expense
Breakdown*:</b></p>
<p>$2600: 5 Weeks Accommodation in Loma Linda,
California</p>
<p>$1800: 3 months of student loan payments</p>
<p>$1600: Flights for Sam and her
Support/Hug-purveyor/Cheerer-upper</p>
<p>$650: 5 Weeks Car Rental</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>*Sam
will have access to modest medical disability, so food, gas, parking and other
incidentals are affordable. She's also planning to do some local fundraising to offset any costs that aren't fundraised here. </b></p>
<p><b>More
Info on the Big, Scary Jerk-of-a-Lump:</b></p>
<p>Sam has an extremely rare, malignant tumor
called an “Intracranial Chondrosarcoma”. These count for 0.15% of all brain
tumors. Roughly 1 out of every 3,500,000 people will ever be diagnosed with one.
Because the tumor is so close to her brain stem, carotid artery and is pressing
on her optical and hearing nerves they won't be able to take it all out. That’s
why she needs the specialized radiation treatment – to take care of the small
amount that will be left in after surgery.</p><p><b>Note from Sam:</b></p><p>First of all - a big thank you to everyone who has helped or offered to help in the last month and a half since I started seeing double.  I appreciate all the well wishes and on-going support. </p><p>If you would like to stay up to date on my progress check out my blog at <a href=""http://sampothier.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://sampothier.wordpress.com/</a></p><p><br/></p><p></p></div>","Sam

person, friend, girlfriend and colleague, she’s overcome the challenges of
growing up in the foster-care system, graduated university and now works to
make things better for kids who have also grown up without their families. As
her friend, I’ve admired her strength and spirit, and how well she can overcome
anything that gets in her way. This is what makes her recent cancer diagnosis
so difficult to fathom.  It’s just so strange
to see her face something she can’t fix—at least, not without some help.
Sam has an extremely rare malignant brain
tumor, which she discovered after experiencing sudden blurry vision. There is a
precise, medical term for it (“Intracranial Chondrosarcoma”); basically she’s
got a big, scary, jerk of a lump lodged between a rock, a hard place and her near
her brain stem, and she needs surgery and radiation ASAP. Because of its
serious nature, Sam’s surgery has been fast-tracked and will be scheduled for June 10 (her brain surgeon normally has a 2 year waiting list).
Where
we come in:
Thankfully, the wonderful Canadian medical
system will cover the surgery, but because of it’s tricky location near the
brain stem, the surgeon won’t be able to get it all out and she’ll need special
radiation treatment. Her type of tumor is so rare that she’ll need to relocate
California for a month to receive special proton radiation therapy. Travel,
accommodation and medication (in addition to hefty, on-going student loan
payments and rent) all add up to much, much more than someone on unpaid medical
leave from a non-profit job can afford—especially someone who doesn’t have the support
that many of us can look to during health crises. 
I believe Sam will be successful with this
treatment—the prognosis is good with proton radiation, and it’s just not Sam’s
style not to be. The difficult reality is that, without a little help, this
treatment will not be possible. 
What
can you do?
1. 
Share this page (it’s free!): the more
shares that her profile gets the higher up she moves on the website. So when
people are looking to donate to a cause they will see Sam’s profile and give
her all the money!
2. 
Share your paycheck!: If you have the
means—whether $5 or $500—every bit you can contribute will help make this very
necessary treatment a reality. 
3. 
Share Sam’s story with your community!: Whether
your community means sports teams, religious affiliations or coworkers, tell
them how awesome Sam is and how donating even $2-$5 could be life altering for
Sam (literally). 
Join us as we all help Sam
show this big, scary jerk of a lump who’s boss. 

With
love and gratitude, 
Lisa
& Friends
Expense
Breakdown*:
$2600: 5 Weeks Accommodation in Loma Linda,
California
$1800: 3 months of student loan payments
$1600: Flights for Sam and her
Support/Hug-purveyor/Cheerer-upper
$650: 5 Weeks Car Rental

*Sam
will have access to modest medical disability, so food, gas, parking and other
incidentals are affordable. She's also planning to do some local fundraising to offset any costs that aren't fundraised here. 
More
Info on the Big, Scary Jerk-of-a-Lump:
Sam has an extremely rare, malignant tumor
called an “Intracranial Chondrosarcoma”. These count for 0.15% of all brain
tumors. Roughly 1 out of every 3,500,000 people will ever be diagnosed with one.
Because the tumor is so close to her brain stem, carotid artery and is pressing
on her optical and hearing nerves they won't be able to take it all out. That’s
why she needs the specialized radiation treatment – to take care of the small
amount that will be left in after surgery.Note from Sam:First of all - a big thank you to everyone who has helped or offered to help in the last month and a half since I started seeing double.  I appreciate all the well wishes and on-going support. If you would like to stay up to date on my progress check out my blog at http://sampothier.wordpress.com/",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","Short Summary My name is Tod Williams I have a strong background in the construction fields.  My wife Sheryl has life long ties to the Elmira community. Sheryl and myself want to educate the public and train individuals to install solar power systems.  
We are looking to crowdfunding to help us to reach our goal of building a Solar (PV) training facility.
With your help we will meet our goal and we will begin to educate the average home owner making a difference in the future path of many families power usage in our Community. 
What We Need & What You Get
 We are looking for 500,000 in funding,  We will use the funds for the building materials to construct our Solar Training Facility, including all the solar power systems needed to run our facilities. 
We will build the facilities ourselves and with the help from our community.  We will have free tours to educate the public, and workshops to train individuals to install Solar Power Systems for home, farm and small commercial installations.
We own a 11 acre lot that is currently farmed,  We will continue to farm 60% of the land the other 40% is designated for our training facilities, and homestead. 
If we do not meet our goal of 500,00 to complete our Elmira Solar Training Facility, we will use the funds to get one step closer to our goal.
The Impact
 Your Contribution will help us so to educate the people in our community on the uses for Renewable energy. 
Your Contribution will help us to train individuals to install solar (PV) systems and teach them how to run their own solar (PV) system business in this rapidly growing industry.
Canada does not rank in the top 10 countries which use renewable energy sources, you will be helping to change this status and be making the world a better place.

At the end of March this year I had a serious snowboarding accident in the French Alps. As a result of the accident I broke 6 vertebrae, a handful of ribs, as well as puncturing a lung and suffering kidney contusions. After being air lifted and spending four days in intensive care in Grenoble CHU, I ended up being fitted with a custom-made torso brace, which I had to wear day and night for three months. I can honestly say that the whole experience has been the most traumatic of my life! </p>
<p>On reflection, and as I continue my recovery, I consider myself extremely lucky not to have been left with any permanent damage. I feel genuinely blessed to be living a relatively pain free existence merely four and a half months after my accident. I awake each morning with a renewed sense of gratitude for all that surrounds me, and it is my strong intention to use the event of my accident as a gift. My experience has sparked an urgency to engage positively with the world and I wish to help those who surround me as well as those who don't. </p>
<p>As a furthering step in my recovery and in the pursuit of my goal I have applied and been accepted onto a course called 'YIP'. YIP is an international Youth Initiative Program, based in Sweden, that helps to foster the initiative and entrepreneurial skills in young adults so that they can go out into the world and face some, or many, of the global challenges of our time. Since its inception seven years ago YIP has helped hundreds of young individuals recognise their true potential. It is a nine month long residential course that I am passionate about attending. Please find more information here: <a href=""http://yip.se/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://yip.se/about/</a> <br/></p>
<p>I wish to use 50% of the money I raise to fund my YIP experience, the other 50% I wish to donate to the Gloucestershire Royal Hospital Intensive care charity. Although I didn't use this particular unit, I did need intensive care treatment in France in the days after my accident, and I was blown away by how well trained the staff were, and how well they all coped in what is surely a very stressful work environment. They also helped me get back on my feet in those initial stages of recovery and I am eternally grateful for that. Without them and modern levels of care, the road to recovery would have been a much longer one. It is this department that I wish to donate to in order to further the incredible work they do... <a href=""http://www.grhicucharity.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.grhicucharity.co.uk/</a> </p>
<p>Any contribution will be gratefully accepted and I cannot stress enough what a difference even the smallest donation will make. The course costs a touch over £7,500 and I have already managed to raise £4,000 through generous donations from my close family. As the course does not fall within the remits of standard educational funding, I am struggling to find the rest. I have set the target on this page at £6,000 and hope to use 50% of this for my course as previously stated, that means that I will hopefully raise £3,000 for the Intensive care charity. I'm sure this will be a massive help to the unit and will no doubt help others much like my self to make good progress in the initial stages of their recovery. Even if this target is not raised, I will stick to my plans of splitting whatever I manage to raise between the two causes. </p>

I included more information about me, the progran and how you can help in a presentation on prezi: <a href=""http://prezi.com/ohgoamia-dll/support-the-learning-journey-of-a-social-entrepreneur/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://prezi.com/ohgoamia-dll/support-the-learning-journey-of-a-social-entrepreneur/</a></p>

<p><strong>About me...</strong></p>
<p>My name is Dina Amiri, I applied Warriors Without Weapons and was ecstatic when I was accepted to participate with 49 other young people from around the globe, after a one month long selection process. What I have found special about this program is that it gets the participants to put their hands to work to make a collective dream of a better world a reality in 30 days! <br/><br/>Brazil is a country that have undergone profound changes such as the consolidation of the democratic process, sound economic performance and the promotion of social justice. <br/>Tolerance, acceptance of differences, and respect of the other are values that I have sensed in an earlier short visit to the country. I will be back with lots of information and experiences to share.</p>
<p>What I do see myself as, is someone who’s informed, committed, passionate and willing to take risks.   </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>If I was to be able to pay the entirety of the costs for the program, that would not only ensure the confirmation of my going, <strong>but also allow the Elos Institute in assisting others around the world who are unable to obtain the financial resources</strong>. The 50 of us accepted to this program are using a cooperative model of fundraising, meaning if we aren’t able to raise enough or we raise more than we need, all extra money is given for our fellow Warriors who are struggling, don’t have the socio-economic context from which to be able to easily run a fundraising campaign, or any other reason.

About me...
My name is Dina Amiri, I applied Warriors Without Weapons and was ecstatic when I was accepted to participate with 49 other young people from around the globe, after a one month long selection process. What I have found special about this program is that it gets the participants to put their hands to work to make a collective dream of a better world a reality in 30 days! Brazil is a country that have undergone profound changes such as the consolidation of the democratic process, sound economic performance and the promotion of social justice. Tolerance, acceptance of differences, and respect of the other are values that I have sensed in an earlier short visit to the country. I will be back with lots of information and experiences to share.
What I do see myself as, is someone who’s informed, committed, passionate and willing to take risks.   
The Impact
If I was to be able to pay the entirety of the costs for the program, that would not only ensure the confirmation of my going, but also allow the Elos Institute in assisting others around the world who are unable to obtain the financial resources. The 50 of us accepted to this program are using a cooperative model of fundraising, meaning if we aren’t able to raise enough or we raise more than we need, all extra money is given for our fellow Warriors who are struggling, don’t have the socio-economic context from which to be able to easily run a fundraising campaign, or any other reason. The rule of thumb is; if you're passionately committed to going, you will.
I am planning to transfer the knowledge to the growing network of social entrepreneurs graduated and attending Namaa School for Sustainable Development. It's expected to reach 300 youth by the end of the year. And we will then move to impact communities in different places around Egypt and create spots of light. May be this could be how will be how we will realize our bigger dream of a better Egypt. And instead of more people leaving the country each day we will have friends and family back.
This is my dream...

<h3 class=""dotty"">About this project</h3>
<p>So here is the deal, we have all been in the position of a tourist once in our lives. Whether its the town next door or a country half way around the world we all know what its like to be out of our element from time to time. Most people think being out of your element is a bit of a uneasy feeling but there is always an upside. As a tourist we are granted with the ability to leave. If you don't like the weather you leave. If you don't like the food you leave. If you don't like the color of the sheets in your hotel room you can leave. Its amazing the power we have as tourists!</p>
<p>This is where the name for this project comes in, Namaste Child. Namaste in its literal translation from Sanskrit means ""Bow-I-You"" or ""I bow to you"" but it is normally used as a greeting or a farewell. When examining the idea of tourism and our ability to impact those in the world around us I found that the name has a very profound meaning. When you see an individual in need along your journey you greet them, interact with them, say your farewells and then they are gone. Only to exist in your memory. But why doesn't the desire for action extend itself beyond that brief moment?</p>
<p>My project Namaste Child is focused on extending the experiences of my trip to India into action. Upon my arrival in India I will focus my camera on the ever growing issue of the homeless and impoverished street children. It is an epidemic that is the largest incident of neglect in the world. With India's population being 1.2 billion strong and having tripled in the past 50 years it is no wonder this issue has yet to slow down. There are currently approximately 15-18 million street children fending for themselves on the streets of India. Organizations like i-India, Hope Child, and Smile Foundation, just to name a few are working diligently on fixing this issue but they can always use some support. </p>
<p>Here is my contribution. I am heading to India in May until the money I bring with me runs out. I will be working my way from the southwest state of Kerala up to the northeast corner of Kolkata and then west to Delhi through the major problem area of Jaipur. I will have my camera on me at all time documenting my travels and experiences. I will be seeking out the experience of the daily lives of the locals with a keen focus on the children. After I am thoroughly exhausted I will sadly leave the beautiful country of India but unlike most tourists my contribution to the country will not end there.</p>
<p>With the images I bring back from my trip I will work tirelessly to put together a gallery showing of my images. Working to get some sponsors to help with the expenses, I will be selling prints and accepting donations for the cause. In addition to the gallery a website will be created to showcase the work and display all the supporters names. Each supporter who donates $100 or more will be recognized on the Namaste Child website. With all the money coming from print sales and donations, 100% of the profits will go to an active organization benefiting the children. I am currently narrowing down a non-profit group working in India to donate the proceeds of this project to. If you have any suggestions I will gladly take nominations.</p>
<p>Lets get down to the breakdown, this is what I am asking you to assist this project with. While I have already self funded and booked the flight and have flexible departure and return dates, there is still so much to do and here is what I need:</p>
<p>Accommodations</p>
<p>Extra Photography Rentals</p>
<p>Food Expenses</p>
<p>Transportation Expenses (Train, Rickshaw, Buses)</p>
<p>Gallery Funding</p>
<p>I am going to be running this project on a pretty tight budget but with your help I can make it happen and give back. Through my efforts we all can do our part in putting a stop to this graphic and inhumane epidemic. Please help me not just leave this trip with a farewell ""namaste"", but to extend our contribution beyond the average tourist.  </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are Cody &amp; Alyssa Cook, two teenagers from Texas, and we have been given the opportunity to spend part of our summer doing mission work through our local church youth group with a community of children in El Salvador. Two years ago we took a trip to Monterrey Mexico with this same group, and we can not wait to do it again! We hope that you will help us raise the money to get there! </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Please watch this <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJHp7Foj2-U"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title=""AIM El Salvador Trip"">video from a previous Mission trip to El Salvador</a>, we hope that it helps you see why we can't wait to go. <br/></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact that this trip has on our personal lives is phenomenal! Having the opportunity to share happiness, candy, toys, and perform various plays, music videos, and give hugs to all the kids just opens our hearts to the commmunity... the world. Spending time with those that are less fortunate, giving of our time, and our efforts, it really puts into perspective what our priorities in life should be. We appreciate what we have more. And our heart is more open to those in need. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The impact on the kids, and the lives of those in the community is that we show them Jesus' love working through us. We show them that they matter to us, and to God. That we took a week out of our summer to spend here working with them, helping them, entertaining them... in hopes that it will directly impact someone, if only one person.. it will be worth it. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We will be traveling with the AIM (Ambassadors in Missions) Group in the North Texas District. AIMers team with nationals under the direction of King's Castle Ministries and train to perform human videos and dramas for school assemblies and street ministry. This is an intense opportunity to reach hundreds for the Kingdom of God. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We believe in this project, and we even asked our mom to change our cruise to Italy so we could go on this trip instead, that's how important this trip is for both of us. </p>

<p><strong>A Celebration of Women™</strong> is honored to share with the Women of our World just 'one' of our application letters that arrive to our mail. We are preparing for our global launch of safe houses and educational units within our <strong>Alumni of WOMEN of ACTION™</strong>, and their territories. Many of the targeted areas we are working to help are outside the reach of present day zones being assisted.</p>
<h3><strong>BELOW is one story:</strong></h3>
<p>For me, the most important way I learn is traveling to rural areas and listening to the women and girls who are struggling against great odds to give their children the chance at a better life. A few months ago, I was in Rural Tanzania 377 Km from the Capital City where I met a young mother named Ogo Ogola aged 29. She has five children now and she is now a widow, didn’t go to school neither her children until now. She want to develop her self, but she has no any mean, capital neither knowledge on how to start.</p>
<p>Every time I come back from a trip, I am overflowing with stories about why women like Ogo are so inspiring to me to go extra far looking for ways to assist back. By meeting people on the ground, I also get to see first-hand how the theme of MCHEEO, the role of measurement in improving delivery, can help poor women/ girls serve people’s needs.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Below are pictures of our recent project to the needy suffering community in Tanzania organized by MCHEEO in collaboration with friends of the organization who are students from Europe.</strong></p>

<p>""I have seen in your website that “ <strong><a href=""http://www.acelebrationofwomen.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A Celebration of Women™</a></strong> is having another incredibly successful year, thanks to all of the hard work by you and your teams.”</p>
<p>“Your focus and dedication to make the world a better place for women/girls is what makes <strong>A Celebration of Women</strong>™ such an incredible and an exemplary organization, and one that MCHEEO aspires to work with. I am thankful for the quick respond of our mail, and I together with the board of directors are so excited about working together with your Organization, soon we are going to grow in areas we never thought possible reaching women/girls in deep rural areas of Tanzania , we have a lot to be thankful for one of them is accepting our request for partnership"".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Catherine, we will soon send you our organization's manifestation with photos as requester by your organization. We are calling for an extraordinary meeting of the board of directors to work on the issue of expense proposal for a starter home inside Tanzania. we will get back to you soon on this.</p>
<p>In the first place, we would like to express our gratitude from the board of directors of MCHEEO for willing to work with us. It is gratifying to know that you Organisation have shown an interest in working with <strong>MCHEEO</strong>. Please accept, Catherine, the assurance of our highest esteem.</p>
<p>There are three compelling reasons why we choose to work for women/girls. First, we never forget where we all came from because we all came from rural areas. It’s safe to say that none of us want to see our women suffering.</p>
<p>And second, we don’t ever want to forget were we came from so we join our hands together as University scholar to find/look for solution. When we flash forward we all see of the wonderful positive changes and people that make up this great family of developed women/girls.</p>
<p>And third, to remind us all that Thanksgiving to our women for all they surrender to make us successful University graduands. its a time to reflect on all of the good in our lives. We all have stresses and challenges however this day is for setting that all aside and to consider all of the blessings we have – our families, friends, co-workers and the pivotal moments that make up our life. It is also a time to send good thoughts out to the women and girls in our rural communities who keep us all safe.</p>

<p><strong>Rev. Sky Starr lives in the Jane/Finch corridor, a troubled neighbourhood that sees frequent gang-related shootings and stabbings. Rev. Starr recognized that violence has left her community in a constant state of grief--so she got trained in grief counselling. Her goal is to help heal her neighbours and friends, because she says, ""there's a need, so I serve. It is in me.""</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>In 2007, Starr started Out of Bounds, a grief support organization that has so far helped over 5,000 people deal with the aftermath of violence. Starr provides non-denominational support and operates out of space donated by the Catholic School Board. </span><br/><br/><span>Started the program in the community, volunteer based program. Starr has recruited and trained over 20 volunteers, from all walks of life. Phil Edwards, an outreach worker for the City of Toronto says Starr is an ""icon"" and is the first person who has helped people in the Jane/Finch community deal with grief on such an organized scale.</span></strong></p>

All volunteers will also manage hotlines for women in crisis, expand awareness of our work online through upgrading our website tools for our readers globally. </p>
<p>This physical presence and new action will manifest further public awareness of <strong><em>Celebration House™,</em></strong> enabling us to raise the final requirements to launch our global mission of one ‘safe house’ in each country suffering from serious violence against women, each in turn will educate, heal and graduate future women leaders, with a goal to house a physical presence on each continent by 2020.</p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 90px;""><strong>“Educate a Woman, change the World”</strong></h3>
<p><strong>We</strong> now must make a physical presence in our home city so to attract further support from sources in our world that ‘<em>need</em>’ the physical as motivation to participate. To-date, we have accumulated hundreds of member women leaders, all ready, willing to volunteer a service, an educational program, or offer volunteer virtual services or serve at events.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>We</strong> have a Headquarters team of women here in Canada who will donate on site expertise. One central location will be established and used to collaborate and create further fund raising events and projects, manage our online education programs, offer in-house educational programs for women/girls.</p>
<p><strong>We</strong> have partnered with some major local organizations and are in the planning stages of large events to raise further funding for the mission of healing women who are victims of serious violence; freeing children from human trafficking, and offering the residential safe house that will not only heal, but will educate, train and offer programs enabling self- sustainability for each and every resident.</p>
<p>Team Celebration has raised thousands of dollars for other charities through our event production, contributed great awareness of the requirement for '<em>investing in women</em>' as one key solution in our world’s economic crisis.</p>
<p><strong>100% of our activities are dedicated to one mission, to build ‘<em>safe houses for young women</em>’ who have been victims of violence, educating them and graduating future women leaders, named <em>Celebration House™</em>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>HOW DID THIS COME TO BE: A Message from the Founder</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">""I was requested to help one young woman to launch a women's empowerment magazine. When the cancellation of that launch occurred 18 months later, I found myself deep inside the world of women not being recognized for their diligence in the world of philanthropy, realizing there was a missing link for the collaboration of NGOs around the world.  </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">The levels of human indignity and suffering at the hands of sexual slavery, female mutilation, lack of education on a global level for women and girls opened my eyes to the fact that the women of our world must 'get organized' and truly start taking these issues more seriously from a grass root level, finding strength in unity; more importantly that the women leading this charge '<em>must be celebrated'</em>.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Prompted by a vision, I created the first and only central stage that I named: <strong>The World Hub for Women Leaders that Care</strong> - an online platform that celebrates the lives, the woman and her work. Collectively, our women member leaders wish to educate girls around the globe, graduating future women leaders.""</p>
<h2 style=""margin-left: 150px;""><strong>""I"" turned into a ""WE""</strong></h2>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 60px;"">
<strong>WE = The Collective Reflection of 'E'very 'W'</strong>oman!</h3>
<p>The genesis of this central hub happened, a stage to Celebrate the Lives of our women leaders (philanthropic) that are Taking Action to create positive change in our world was born!</p>
<p>Noticing that women have not yet realized that for sustainable equity to be achieved,  '<em>Equality of Women Amongst Women</em>' must come first.</p>
<p><strong>One central HUB was created for this purpose.  </strong></p>
<p>As the awakening of the suffering, torture and violence that the women of our world are living with increased, my heart bled, my mind raced and my soul reached. Being educated to the fact that a great amount of this violence is managed by women against women, my heart broke.</p>
<h3>When Women reflect as equals, global change will arrive!</h3>
<p>Reaching all the women leaders who were devoting their lives to changing this horrific truth, and noticing that there was no central stage where they were being acknowledged, advocated or celebrated, <strong>A Celebration of Women<em>™,  </em></strong>was born as the '<em>first central platform</em>' to do just that!</p>
<p>Finding this void in our global structure, I decided to Take Action and create this central platform that would celebrate the Positive Action of women leaders - the unsung SHE-heros, those collectively working for positive change in the lives of all women and children. </p>
<p>By 2011, the decision to take this vision to the next level occurred and application for charity approval was made in Canada and!  </p>
<h3>
<strong>Patent Letter approved , a</strong><strong> new foundation was born in 2011!</strong>  </h3>
<p>Upon this approval, the vision to build educational, residential safe houses was expanded, and we have not looked back since. </p>
<p>Team Celebration invested every waking moment to this mission ever since, and have achieved the most amazing team of women leaders from all continents that contribute to this vision, as well.  </p>
<h3><strong>Our collective has a powerful positive butterfly effect!</strong></h3>
<p>If you are not in a position of offer any form of funding, we would love to hear from you anyway!  We are always seeking helpful souls with ability to appreciate our goal, ones <strong>who </strong>could offer some time in mentorship, spreading the news, or making suggestions on how we can reach our goals.</p>
<h3><strong>Help 'us' educate young women grow into future women leaders!</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Join us in this celebration of women! Support us in our mission of educational and economic empowerment of women! Together we can contribute towards the progress of women and society at large by giving them the necessary skills, imparting them quality education and instilling in them the requisite amount of self-confidence for their effective participation in the developmental process which will bear fruits for generations to come</strong>!!</p>

<p> </p></div>","A Celebration of Women™ is honored to share with the Women of our World just 'one' of our application letters that arrive to our mail. We are preparing for our global launch of safe houses and educational units within our Alumni of WOMEN of ACTION™, and their territories. Many of the targeted areas we are working to help are outside the reach of present day zones being assisted.
BELOW is one story:
For me, the most important way I learn is traveling to rural areas and listening to the women and girls who are struggling against great odds to give their children the chance at a better life. A few months ago, I was in Rural Tanzania 377 Km from the Capital City where I met a young mother named Ogo Ogola aged 29. She has five children now and she is now a widow, didn’t go to school neither her children until now. She want to develop her self, but she has no any mean, capital neither knowledge on how to start.
Every time I come back from a trip, I am overflowing with stories about why women like Ogo are so inspiring to me to go extra far looking for ways to assist back. By meeting people on the ground, I also get to see first-hand how the theme of MCHEEO, the role of measurement in improving delivery, can help poor women/ girls serve people’s needs.
Below are pictures of our recent project to the needy suffering community in Tanzania organized by MCHEEO in collaboration with friends of the organization who are students from Europe.

Geofry R Celebration House™, TanzaniaCatherine Anne Clark, Founder & CEO

""I have seen in your website that “ A Celebration of Women™ is having another incredibly successful year, thanks to all of the hard work by you and your teams.”
“Your focus and dedication to make the world a better place for women/girls is what makes A Celebration of Women™ such an incredible and an exemplary organization, and one that MCHEEO aspires to work with. I am thankful for the quick respond of our mail, and I together with the board of directors are so excited about working together with your Organization, soon we are going to grow in areas we never thought possible reaching women/girls in deep rural areas of Tanzania , we have a lot to be thankful for one of them is accepting our request for partnership"".

Catherine, we will soon send you our organization's manifestation with photos as requester by your organization. We are calling for an extraordinary meeting of the board of directors to work on the issue of expense proposal for a starter home inside Tanzania. we will get back to you soon on this.
In the first place, we would like to express our gratitude from the board of directors of MCHEEO for willing to work with us. It is gratifying to know that you Organisation have shown an interest in working with MCHEEO. Please accept, Catherine, the assurance of our highest esteem.
There are three compelling reasons why we choose to work for women/girls. First, we never forget where we all came from because we all came from rural areas. It’s safe to say that none of us want to see our women suffering.
And second, we don’t ever want to forget were we came from so we join our hands together as University scholar to find/look for solution. When we flash forward we all see of the wonderful positive changes and people that make up this great family of developed women/girls.
And third, to remind us all that Thanksgiving to our women for all they surrender to make us successful University graduands. its a time to reflect on all of the good in our lives. We all have stresses and challenges however this day is for setting that all aside and to consider all of the blessings we have – our families, friends, co-workers and the pivotal moments that make up our life. It is also a time to send good thoughts out to the women and girls in our rural communities who keep us all safe.

Rev. Sky Starr lives in the Jane/Finch corridor, a troubled neighbourhood that sees frequent gang-related shootings and stabbings. Rev. Starr recognized that violence has left her community in a constant state of grief--so she got trained in grief counselling. Her goal is to help heal her neighbours and friends, because she says, ""there's a need, so I serve. It is in me.""
In 2007, Starr started Out of Bounds, a grief support organization that has so far helped over 5,000 people deal with the aftermath of violence. Starr provides non-denominational support and operates out of space donated by the Catholic School Board. Started the program in the community, volunteer based program. Starr has recruited and trained over 20 volunteers, from all walks of life. Phil Edwards, an outreach worker for the City of Toronto says Starr is an ""icon"" and is the first person who has helped people in the Jane/Finch community deal with grief on such an organized scale.

""Educate a Woman; Change the World"" 
Celebration House™
A Celebration of Women™, a global not for profit that has been working for the education and empowerment of women since 2009. Team Celebration has built the global Alumni of WOMEN of ACTION™, housing hundreds of women leaders today on every continent. Our women leaders around the globe are ready, willing and able to assist us in the management of our educational residential safe houses, named: Celebration House™.
What We Need


We ask for your DONATION will assist us in setting up the infrastructure for a central nerve center, a media office operating for the express purpose of event planning, funding raising management, and the expansion of awareness for the building of safe houses around the globe; residential safe houses that will educate, heal and nurture new life into women that have been victimized by violence. 

We need your financial support as the ignition to the above mentioned central office/media center here in Canada so to create a physical and visible presence in our home based location; and act as your central head office for our global presence. 

Our women do want a brainstorming space, one where they can expand services, expand their own respective missions, and collectively create.  Our 'virtual world' has expanded ... and ironically no calls for a physical space. WE envision all our 'actions' to be 'collective', so we invite you today to JOIN US and be part of a great cause. Once we establish our on-site social media team of educators, mentors and trainers, with management in one space, we will launch our online school, educating young women and girls globally.


We offer you this opportunity to support and become the ignition to the above mentioned central head quarters/media center here in Canada. Together we can create a physical and visible presence in our home based location; and act as your central head office for our global presence.
 
WE believe together we can contribute towards education of women and girls that will bring a change to our world.
ONE Idea!!   ONE mission!!!   ""Educate and Empower Women/Girls!""
Help Educate at least One woman via #CelebrationHouse and Empower at least one girl/woman  PLease Take action now- ONE  DONATION is all we need from YOU!
What You Get


You will be welcome to visit and celebrate your name on our CELEBRATION WALL of DISTINCTION.  As part of this cornerstone, you will make a global statement that you are willing to Take Action and contribute in a cause towards the betterment of lives and education for all women and children.

You will be able to offer your services through our center, contribute suggestions, participate in our events, in person or online. 

You will become a change maker of opportunity to the youth of our society.

You will be able to monitor activity and accomplishments at this center as weekly news will be published on our website, audio, video and feature.
The Impact - Expanding Awareness and Services
Your participation/sponsorship is valuable to our world because once this central media center is opened, Team Celebration will offer space to seniors, university interns and college students who will in turn provide online education mentor programs for our women/children globally. All volunteers will also manage hotlines for women in crisis, expand awareness of our work online through upgrading our website tools for our readers globally. 
This physical presence and new action will manifest further public awareness of Celebration House™, enabling us to raise the final requirements to launch our global mission of one ‘safe house’ in each country suffering from serious violence against women, each in turn will educate, heal and graduate future women leaders, with a goal to house a physical presence on each continent by 2020.
“Educate a Woman, change the World”
We now must make a physical presence in our home city so to attract further support from sources in our world that ‘need’ the physical as motivation to participate. To-date, we have accumulated hundreds of member women leaders, all ready, willing to volunteer a service, an educational program, or offer volunteer virtual services or serve at events.
We have a Headquarters team of women here in Canada who will donate on site expertise. One central location will be established and used to collaborate and create further fund raising events and projects, manage our online education programs, offer in-house educational programs for women/girls.
We have partnered with some major local organizations and are in the planning stages of large events to raise further funding for the mission of healing women who are victims of serious violence; freeing children from human trafficking, and offering the residential safe house that will not only heal, but will educate, train and offer programs enabling self- sustainability for each and every resident.
Team Celebration has raised thousands of dollars for other charities through our event production, contributed great awareness of the requirement for 'investing in women' as one key solution in our world’s economic crisis.
100% of our activities are dedicated to one mission, to build ‘safe houses for young women’ who have been victims of violence, educating them and graduating future women leaders, named Celebration House™.
HOW DID THIS COME TO BE: A Message from the Founder
""I was requested to help one young woman to launch a women's empowerment magazine. When the cancellation of that launch occurred 18 months later, I found myself deep inside the world of women not being recognized for their diligence in the world of philanthropy, realizing there was a missing link for the collaboration of NGOs around the world.  
The levels of human indignity and suffering at the hands of sexual slavery, female mutilation, lack of education on a global level for women and girls opened my eyes to the fact that the women of our world must 'get organized' and truly start taking these issues more seriously from a grass root level, finding strength in unity; more importantly that the women leading this charge 'must be celebrated'.
Prompted by a vision, I created the first and only central stage that I named: The World Hub for Women Leaders that Care - an online platform that celebrates the lives, the woman and her work. Collectively, our women member leaders wish to educate girls around the globe, graduating future women leaders.""
""I"" turned into a ""WE""

WE = The Collective Reflection of 'E'very 'W'oman!
The genesis of this central hub happened, a stage to Celebrate the Lives of our women leaders (philanthropic) that are Taking Action to create positive change in our world was born!
Noticing that women have not yet realized that for sustainable equity to be achieved,  'Equality of Women Amongst Women' must come first.
One central HUB was created for this purpose.  
As the awakening of the suffering, torture and violence that the women of our world are living with increased, my heart bled, my mind raced and my soul reached. Being educated to the fact that a great amount of this violence is managed by women against women, my heart broke.
When Women reflect as equals, global change will arrive!
Reaching all the women leaders who were devoting their lives to changing this horrific truth, and noticing that there was no central stage where they were being acknowledged, advocated or celebrated, A Celebration of Women™,  was born as the 'first central platform' to do just that!
Finding this void in our global structure, I decided to Take Action and create this central platform that would celebrate the Positive Action of women leaders - the unsung SHE-heros, those collectively working for positive change in the lives of all women and children. 
By 2011, the decision to take this vision to the next level occurred and application for charity approval was made in Canada and!  

Patent Letter approved , a new foundation was born in 2011!  
Upon this approval, the vision to build educational, residential safe houses was expanded, and we have not looked back since. 
Team Celebration invested every waking moment to this mission ever since, and have achieved the most amazing team of women leaders from all continents that contribute to this vision, as well.  
Our collective has a powerful positive butterfly effect!
If you are not in a position of offer any form of funding, we would love to hear from you anyway!  We are always seeking helpful souls with ability to appreciate our goal, ones who could offer some time in mentorship, spreading the news, or making suggestions on how we can reach our goals.
Help 'us' educate young women grow into future women leaders!
Join us in this celebration of women! Support us in our mission of educational and economic empowerment of women! Together we can contribute towards the progress of women and society at large by giving them the necessary skills, imparting them quality education and instilling in them the requisite amount of self-confidence for their effective participation in the developmental process which will bear fruits for generations to come!!
Engage with us, if WE strike a chord with YOU! 
Your expertise is not to be wasted; please email our contact page at http://www.acelebrationofwomen.org/
If we do not reach our goal, these funds will be put into trust, until a collective of our campaigns will meet our goal.  *A statement from Indiegogo will be copied and published on our website, sans individual names at: http://www.acelebrationofwomen.org/ .

<p> </p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"">Hi!</h3>
<p>It is no secret, that Christmas is getting closer. And what is this, if not a magical time of a gifts? Remember, how you enjoyed your presents by your parents, grandmas and grandpas, uncles and aunts. Unfortantly, for most of us, this time is long in the past, but we beleive, that it is fundamentally wrong. Let’s try to budge situation and turn the world together!<br/><br/>We organize anonymous Santa’s club and invites everyone to participate in this. Let’s recall how Christmas can be great and wonderful. Let’s make a celebration for everyone and allow to feel bright moments for those, who haven’t them enough.</p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"">Aim</h3>
<p>So, what we do? Anonymous Santa’s club is a group of people, who actually makes the world better and brighter. We give people, who cease to believe in a human goodwill, a holiday. Every Christmas we give gifts of those, who almost no one can please. Children who live in an orphanage and children with life-threatening diseases for which all life is struggling for survival. They are so essential to a ray of light that we can give them. That you can give them!<br/><br/>Please just try to imagine how difficult for them to live in this world. Little orphan freezing in the most vivid childhood day, which they took away. Children with cancer are due every Christmas in their lives, because, maybe they wouldn’t see the next one.</p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"">As before</h3>
<p>We, anonymous Santa Clauses, exists for a several years. We gave gifts to only one orphanage and one hospital every year. Our capabilities, unfortunately, is not limitless. That’s why we have decided to ask you to join the ranks of the anonymous Santa’s club. You can help for those to whom the rest of the world has refused to help.<br/><br/>Adult, even if he is one and he has no one left, can still working at a minimal job. But, unfortunately, many don’t even want it. A small child growing up without parent is a grief. And he has a great desire to change everything, but his capabilities is very much limited. So complex our world.<br/><br/>By the way, we think too hard for those, who are fighting for their lives every day and every hour. For those, who can hear tomorrow a verdict: “You have less, then month. Say goodbye to everyone. Man is unknown world. Child is unknown bright world where there is no suffering and pain. The world can not be just a month. How long is the month in our world? Very, very short.</p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"">As has now become</h3>
<p>Very soon, the snow falls and the streets filled by Santa Claus, who will greet all with the Christmas. This is a most magical holiday in the year. Let’s donate a piece of happiness and bright holiday for everyone who we can. Let us reach more children, which are so necessary for human love, warmth and care. If we are united, we can! Together we can do everything!<br/><br/>Become anonymous Santa Claus with us!</p>
<h3>How you can help in another way</h3>

Hi!
It is no secret, that Christmas is getting closer. And what is this, if not a magical time of a gifts? Remember, how you enjoyed your presents by your parents, grandmas and grandpas, uncles and aunts. Unfortantly, for most of us, this time is long in the past, but we beleive, that it is fundamentally wrong. Let’s try to budge situation and turn the world together!We organize anonymous Santa’s club and invites everyone to participate in this. Let’s recall how Christmas can be great and wonderful. Let’s make a celebration for everyone and allow to feel bright moments for those, who haven’t them enough.
Aim
So, what we do? Anonymous Santa’s club is a group of people, who actually makes the world better and brighter. We give people, who cease to believe in a human goodwill, a holiday. Every Christmas we give gifts of those, who almost no one can please. Children who live in an orphanage and children with life-threatening diseases for which all life is struggling for survival. They are so essential to a ray of light that we can give them. That you can give them!Please just try to imagine how difficult for them to live in this world. Little orphan freezing in the most vivid childhood day, which they took away. Children with cancer are due every Christmas in their lives, because, maybe they wouldn’t see the next one.
As before
We, anonymous Santa Clauses, exists for a several years. We gave gifts to only one orphanage and one hospital every year. Our capabilities, unfortunately, is not limitless. That’s why we have decided to ask you to join the ranks of the anonymous Santa’s club. You can help for those to whom the rest of the world has refused to help.Adult, even if he is one and he has no one left, can still working at a minimal job. But, unfortunately, many don’t even want it. A small child growing up without parent is a grief. And he has a great desire to change everything, but his capabilities is very much limited. So complex our world.By the way, we think too hard for those, who are fighting for their lives every day and every hour. For those, who can hear tomorrow a verdict: “You have less, then month. Say goodbye to everyone. Man is unknown world. Child is unknown bright world where there is no suffering and pain. The world can not be just a month. How long is the month in our world? Very, very short.
As has now become
Very soon, the snow falls and the streets filled by Santa Claus, who will greet all with the Christmas. This is a most magical holiday in the year. Let’s donate a piece of happiness and bright holiday for everyone who we can. Let us reach more children, which are so necessary for human love, warmth and care. If we are united, we can! Together we can do everything!Become anonymous Santa Claus with us!
How you can help in another way
If you would like to participate, but can’t, then tell to anyone about this project, anyone you can! We have so limit time. For all the money, our club will purchase the necessary gifts, toys, and, what isn’t least, medicines and warn clothes!In the end, I would like to say just one sentence: “Thank you very much and have a Happy Merry Christmas”.

<h3>Balkan Children's Judo Tournament - Shkoder, Albania</h3>
<p>Our goal is to purchase equipment for an annual Balkan Children's Judo Tournament on April 13, 2013. Judo is a positive sport for children because it promotes self discipline, respect, and self-control. A Balkan Judo tournament is a great opporunity spread this positive message as well as promote cultural exchange and good will in the Balkans.</p>
<p>We held the first Judo For Peace Cup in Shkoder in September 2012. Teams from Croatia, Montengro, Kosovo, and Albania came to compete. In order to hold this tournament we had to borrow equipment from visiting teams. We are holding this fundraising campaign to purchase our own equipment so we can sustainbly hold our own tournaments starting with a Childrens Tournament on April 13, 2013. Our goal is to evenutally host a tournament that includes every Balkan country.</p>
<p>Anton Shkoza was introduced to Judo while on politcal asylum in Greece and Italy from 1990 -1993. When he returned his hometown Vau Dejës, he introduced the art of Judo for the first time in Albania. Since then he has worked relentlessly to promote and improve the sport of Judo in Albania. He is the president of Akademi Albania Judo Kodokan. Edmond Topalli, one of Anton's students in Vau-Dejës, competed in the Bejing Olympics. All of the children in Vau-Dejës are given the opportunity to study Judo for FREE, as long as they show discipline and dedication to the sport and stay away from harmful activities such as smoking.</p>
<p>Corey Rice, is a Community and Organizational Peace Corps Volunteer serving in Vau-Dejës. His main project is to help increase the capacity of Akademi Albania Judo Kodokan. He directed the first national promotional effort of Judo in Albania, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Al1Y-asf8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Judo For Peace"">Judo For Peace</a>, and helped plan the first Judo for Peace Cup in Shkoder, where teams from Montegro, Kosovo, Croatia, and Albania came to compete.</p>

<p>Attention spans being brief in a world so atwitter, we decided to aim for a concise result that could serve, if need be, as an ‘agreement in principle’ – as a ‘way-forward’; perhaps upon which a more textured, final understanding could be built. <br/></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Middle East is changing. Let’s try to make it a change for the better. For everyone.</p>
<p>No one needs to be sold on the many benefits that would be derived from any just settlement of the Israel-Palestine dilemma. The main question, with respect to this particular campaign, would seem to be whether a few hundred—or even a few thousand—people could have a substantial impact on such a complex and deeply-rooted problem...</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>... which begs the question: How many people <i>does</i> it take to change the world? </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The maximum number would now be somewhere around... seven billion. But, examining the history of man, a strong argument can surely be made that the minimum number is one. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>It could even be you! With the right idea... at the right time... who knows? </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Be the one. Make a difference.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We’re aiming for a target of $30,000 which will allow us to do a longer, high-quality, print run; expand our editorial and contributor base; cover some operational expenses; and send three representatives to the region this July for discussions with key policy makers – as well as engage with regular people on the street. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Should we fail to reach our funding objective, the initiative will carry on; we’ll just do a shorter print run and send only one or two people. We have been operating since fourth-quarter 2009, thanks to a generous community of supporters and their conceptual, in-kind and financial contributions.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Should we, by some miracle, exceed our target, we would then endeavor to scale up our efforts accordingly.</p>

Since October 2009, I have been editor of an unusual peace initiative, the core of which is an evolving, collaborative document, entitled, A Peace of Jerusalem. 

Over a course of nine months, we solicited, captured and collated the opinions, brainstorms and aspirations of average, everyday people in more than 20 countries (on several continents) each of whom had concerns about the long- and/or short-term stability of the Middle East.
Between November 5, 2009, and August 7, 2010, dozens of iterations of an emerging text were posted to the blog that still plays host to the initiative’s master document.   

In all, more than 300 people have so far been involved in the process, a few of whom worked on distilling our diverse pool of ideas into a coherent stream of less than 2,000 words – if you don’t include the preamble and postscripts. 
Attention spans being brief in a world so atwitter, we decided to aim for a concise result that could serve, if need be, as an ‘agreement in principle’ – as a ‘way-forward’; perhaps upon which a more textured, final understanding could be built. 

Following the first printing of A Peace of Jerusalem, on December 13, 2010, a copy was delivered to every contributor that provided us with a valid mailing address, but who will otherwise—like all participants in this project—remain anonymous. 


Overall, APoJi has enjoyed a generally positive reception:

A former Canadian UN Ambassador wrote: 
“APoJ(i) is an interesting concept that bears closer examination.”

After reviewing the document, the Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs wrote: 
“Canada continues to urge the parties to fulfill all of their obligations and resume direct negotiations in pursuit of a comprehensive two-state solution. Canada stands ready to assist the parties in any way, if requested.”

Of course, the document isn’t perfect, but there are a few pending 'clarity' edits that should make it somewhat 'less imperfect'. And, of course, we’re always open to more great ideas!

To review the proposal, just visit http://apoji.ca; and, while you’re there, you can drop us a comment – or request a free, printable PDF version of the 2010 print edition.

The Middle East is changing. Let’s try to make it a change for the better. For everyone.
No one needs to be sold on the many benefits that would be derived from any just settlement of the Israel-Palestine dilemma. The main question, with respect to this particular campaign, would seem to be whether a few hundred—or even a few thousand—people could have a substantial impact on such a complex and deeply-rooted problem...

... which begs the question: How many people does it take to change the world? 

The maximum number would now be somewhere around... seven billion. But, examining the history of man, a strong argument can surely be made that the minimum number is one. 

It could even be you! With the right idea... at the right time... who knows? 

Be the one. Make a difference.



What We Need & What You Get
We’re aiming for a target of $30,000 which will allow us to do a longer, high-quality, print run; expand our editorial and contributor base; cover some operational expenses; and send three representatives to the region this July for discussions with key policy makers – as well as engage with regular people on the street. 

Should we fail to reach our funding objective, the initiative will carry on; we’ll just do a shorter print run and send only one or two people. We have been operating since fourth-quarter 2009, thanks to a generous community of supporters and their conceptual, in-kind and financial contributions.

Should we, by some miracle, exceed our target, we would then endeavor to scale up our efforts accordingly.

For the gift of:


a good idea, you will receive a copy of the July 2011 Digital Edition of the proposal, as soon as it becomes available (medium-resolution, printable PDF, delivered by email)

$5 or more, you will receive a personalized thank you email, plus the Digital Edition


$20 or more, you will be mailed a personal letter of thanks, plus the above incentives


$50 or more, we’ll send you the 2011 Print Edition of the proposal, plus the above


$200 or more, you’ll score a commemorative APoJi T-shirt, plus the above


$500 or more, we’ll ship you a special 2011 Hardcover Edition, plus the above


$1,000 or more, you will receive additional recognition in the form of a personally-engraved brass and wooden plaque, plus the above

— all funds denominated in $USD

Pitch in:


Visit the main project page (http://apoji.ca) and review the current version of the text; offer some of your own thoughts on the subject; and invite your most optimistic and creative friends to do the same. On second thought, just send them all – some of our best ideas were born of controversy.

Submit a short (500-word max.) original essay, poem or reflection on peace; some of these will be incorporated into the July 2011 editions. A special token of appreciation (yet to be decided) will be awarded to authors whose works are selected for inclusion.

<h3>Building a Community of Care and Connection around Social Good</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Many young adults have a
strong desire to effect change at home and in the world, but find it difficult
to engage in meaningful work based on a lack of resources, lack of
personal/professional networks, and a lack of available entry-level positions
that challenge them to be bold, innovative, and work with others to serve the
public good. <b>Connected Potential (CP) </b>aims to enlist the powerful potential of young adults in creating change
in their communities and in the world by connecting them with business advisors
and professional mentors to get community-driven projects off the ground.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At a time when young adults are increasingly driven to have a personal impact and engage in positive social change, it has become harder than ever for them to find meaningful positions in the workforce. We see Connected Potential as an alternate form of professional development for young adults interested in social good careers. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Our network of mentors (we like to call them #Catalysts) offer expert guidance and support to young adults</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> seeking to have a positive

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Our impact will be through the young adults we work with (increased leadership

<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Our Strategy for Funding</h3>
<p>We are seeking $10,000 to support the following activities:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Early Stage Seed Fund</b>. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">75% of money raised through this campaign will be distributed to young adults engaged in social change work. Each young adult will need to go through our program to qualify for funding, and their project proposal will go through a review process. Small financial awards will be given ($250-$500) to provide matching contributions to their fundraising efforts.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>A Series of Tools and Resources</b>. Connected Potential is working to develop an e-book with concise and relatable ""How-To"" guides for young adults interested in social entrepreneurship and community-based work. We will use a collaborative approach to developing our resources by inviting experts at other national organizations invested in youth participation and innovation to contribute to the text. This ensures the best content and exposes students to a variety of expertise and opportunity.</span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/103775/files/20130930074039-campaign_image_8.png?1380552039"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em; width: 502.34939759036143px; height: 310px;""/>These guides will be released as serial chapters to campus civic centers and career centers across the country. They will provide exciting and valuable content for college students interested in pursuing social good careers, and will help direct young adults to additional resources offered through Connected Potential's website or through other affiliated organizations. </li>
<li>
<b>Campus to Community Innovation Challenge. </b>Connected Potential has applied for a small grant to organize the <i>Campus to Community Innovation Challenge</i> in Washington, DC. The project would bring together campus teams from area colleges and universities to develop community-driven projects. The program includes a speaker series, time spent with hand selected mentors and business advisors, and a culminating community fundraiser where family and friends gather to hear the teams pitch their final concepts and pledge their support. If we receive the grant, $1,500 of funding raised through this campaign will be applied to support the project.</li>

we hope to create opportunities for young adults to engage in meaningful work
while addressing contemporary challenges in their communities and beyond.





Young adults have tons of great ideas, but often have difficulty securing funding to support them. Your contribution will help Connected Potential establish an early stage seed fund that will support the fundraising efforts of young adults around the country.


Our Strategy for Funding
We are seeking $10,000 to support the following activities:


Early Stage Seed Fund. 75% of money raised through this campaign will be distributed to young adults engaged in social change work. Each young adult will need to go through our program to qualify for funding, and their project proposal will go through a review process. Small financial awards will be given ($250-$500) to provide matching contributions to their fundraising efforts.


A Series of Tools and Resources. Connected Potential is working to develop an e-book with concise and relatable ""How-To"" guides for young adults interested in social entrepreneurship and community-based work. We will use a collaborative approach to developing our resources by inviting experts at other national organizations invested in youth participation and innovation to contribute to the text. This ensures the best content and exposes students to a variety of expertise and opportunity.These guides will be released as serial chapters to campus civic centers and career centers across the country. They will provide exciting and valuable content for college students interested in pursuing social good careers, and will help direct young adults to additional resources offered through Connected Potential's website or through other affiliated organizations. 

Campus to Community Innovation Challenge. Connected Potential has applied for a small grant to organize the Campus to Community Innovation Challenge in Washington, DC. The project would bring together campus teams from area colleges and universities to develop community-driven projects. The program includes a speaker series, time spent with hand selected mentors and business advisors, and a culminating community fundraiser where family and friends gather to hear the teams pitch their final concepts and pledge their support. If we receive the grant, $1,500 of funding raised through this campaign will be applied to support the project.



The Vision:


We envision a world where


Young adults have access to the opportunity, resources, and connections to realize their goals and improve the world.
Professionals have the opportunity to volunteer time in a direct and high-impact way to assist others with social change projects.
A community of care and connection around social change is created for young adults and professionals.







Our Catalysts:
Connected Potential Catalysts are hand-selected professionals with proven experience at igniting change and making a difference. Each project submitted to Connected Potential is matched with a business advisor and professional mentor that are best suited for the project’s success. Our catalysts help young adults follow their passion, build leadership and professional skills, and bring positive change to the community through social good projects.







Business Advisors advise on organizational aspects of a community based project: Team building, project management, finding partners and sponsors, and marketing strategy.
Professional Mentors represent all sectors, and advise on areas of professional expertise specific to a social good project.

<h3>Hi ABUNDANT ANGELS!!!!!!</h3>
<p>I am a graduate student almost finished with my two year masters program in Spiritual Psychology at the University of Santa Monica. <a href=""http://www.universityofsantamonica.edu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.universityofsantamonica.edu</a></p>
<p>What is Spiritual Psychology?</p>
<div class=""content"">
<h2>Right now, more than any time in history, people are evaluating their lives through the filter of these essential questions:</h2>
</div>
<div id=""why_gradient"">
<h3>1) Who Am I? <br/>2) What is My Purpose? <br/>3) How Can I Make a Meaningful Contribution in the World?</h3>
</div>
<div class=""content"">For over 30 years, the University of Santa Monica, the <em>Worldwide Center for the Study and Practice of Spiritual Psychology</em>®, has been diligently and lovingly providing innovative Master's Degree Programs in Spiritual Psychology. The University's Soul-Centered experiential educational paradigm evokes in students their own answers to these three essential questions resulting in more purposeful and fulfilling lives. Each individual student is recognized, honored, and respected for the Essence of who they truly are.</div>
<p>Spiritual Psychology is the study and practice of the art and science of human evolution in consciousness. In order to fulfill this quest, we must begin by distinguishing the essence of human evolution—what does it mean to evolve? In short, it means surrendering anything in consciousness that disturbs one’s peace. It also means sacrificing our illusions of separation in service to the deeper revelation of who we truly are as Loving, Peaceful, Compassionate and Joyful beings. We refer to this level of awareness as the Authentic Self.</p>
<p>Over the course of two years a class of over 200 students came together and began this incredible journey to the authentic Self. My intention in participating in this program was to more effectively take on the challenge that Gandhi's famous quote implies; Be the change you wish to see in the world.</p>
<p>I want to see a world where everyone wins. Where there truly is enough for all. </p>
<p>I know that every dollar you give to support these students to completion will be such an affirmation towards this vision. </p>
<p>ONE FOR ALL AND ALL FOR ONE</p>
<p>JOIN US IN THIS COMMITMENT!!!!</p>
<p>Your donation will help us all graduate together by helping students that are short for the praticum expenses. Praticum costs are 3800.00 per student. There are aprox 12 students who are needing partial funds for praticum.</p>
<p>If we raise more than what we need it is our intention to donate the extra funds to the class of 2013 Spirit Walk fund and continue our legacy of giving!</p>
<p>Praticum is a 5 day transformational retreat in August that is the cumulation of the Masters Program. </p>
<p>Once completed we will all be qualified to graduate in August!!!!</p>
<p>One of the primary ongoing intentions at USM is to foster and nurture a culture of giving. Such a culture begins with the understanding that giving and receiving are part of the circular flow of loving, caring, and sharing that are essential to the University’s Soul-Centered educational process. </p>
<p>I deeply believe in the benefits the masters program has made in my life and in the lives of my classmates. It has been a rigorous program that takes deep courage and commitment to ones Self to Master. Many of our fellow classmates dropped out along the way for many reasons some of them being financial. It is a challenge to meet the demands of a full time job and this program. I am watching so many people transform their lives. In other cultures there are ashrams where people could go away from the cares of the material ""world"" and embark upon a deep transformational experience. These people enriched the world for us all with the wisdom they shared.</p>
<p>USM is unique in that it's very structure it supports integration with the world around us, so that when we complete the program we will be prepared to BE the CHANGE we WISH to Be in the world and in our lives. </p>
<h3>It’s just too close to call as to who derives more value, those who are “giving” or those who are “receiving.”</h3>
<p>Now for the FUN PART!!!!!!!</p>
<p>An aspect of the masters program was to create a second year project that had a deep and profound meaning for each student.</p>
<p>Many have evolved their soul purposes through this process and they are sharing their gifts with all of you who donate. Most of the class has donated their special gift to this cause truly creating a ""barn raising"" or ""rent party"" vibe. We are all in it together and we invite you to join us!!!!!!</p>
<p>If we do not reach our full goal all funds we raise will be used to help the most people possible make it to praticum. Each student is pursuing their own fundraising goals as well and we are certain that we will meet our objective though all of our fund raising efforts!!!!</p>

<h3>Love Dall Saag at a 2?</h3>
<p>Then you probably know and love Sunayana Palikhe, John &amp; Rama's niece, as the lovely waitress at Indian American Cafe for the last two years. But, did you know that she is studying pre-dentistry? That she was a hygienist in Nepal? That her dream is to educate Nepali children about oral hygiene and create free cleaning clinics? </p>
<p>Sunayana is beautiful, inside and out. And to help her achieve part of her dreams, she has entered Miss Nepal US, to be held on August 17, 2013 in New York City. If she wins, she will be flown to Nepal and be given the opportunity and means to expand clinics and education in a country so desperately lacking these resources. </p>
<p><strong>What can you do to help?</strong></p>
<p>1- Contribute to this campaign!<br/>and/or<br/>2- Send this link to anyone you think could help!</p>
<p>If you contribute, your funds will pay for several things:<br/>-Sunayana's travel expenses to New York (approximately $500)<br/>-Clothing for the competition itself (approximately $500)<br/>-A week-long mandatory training session including room and board ($1000)<br/>-Extra monies will go directly to charities supporting oral health in Nepal </p>
<p><strong>What's in it for you?</strong></p>
<p>Sponsors of $200 or more will have their business or organization advertised at the Miss Nepal US competition in televised broadcasts and mentioned in printed materials as well as their website. They have over two dozen media partners!</p>
<p>For those of us who don't have quite so much to offer, we can still make a difference with a few bucks here and there. Any amount will help Sunayana pay for this trip. </p>
<p>If you have ever gone to Indian American Cafe and she has made your dining experience enjoyable as your waitress, then consider this an extra $5-50 tip! She's worth it! Sunayana loves living here in Harrisonburg and wants very much to represent our community in this special endeavor.</p>

<p>Finnish Studies at the University of Toronto needs your help.  To meet our obligations during 2015-2016, the Canadian Friends of Finland Education Foundation (CFFEF), founded in 1990 in support of Finnish Studies at UofT, now needs to raise a minimum of $25,000 </p>
<p><b>You can help by (1) sending in a donation, (2) spreading the word and the link to your friends and acquaintances.</b> </p>
<p><b>As a donor you can give any amount: $10, $25, $50, $100, $200, $500 or more! </b></p>
<p>Canadian donors of $25 or more will receive tax receipts, so please include your name and address with your donation.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Who Are We?</h3> <p></p>
<p>CFFEF’s mission is to raise
funds for Finnish Studies at the University of Toronto, where the Finnish
Studies Program was established in 1989. In multicultural Canada it is
essential to teach Finnish Studies at the university level. A partnership was
formed between Canada’s leading University, the University of Toronto, and the
Government of Finland. The Finnish Studies Program has ever since taught
courses in Finnish language, Finnish literature, Finnish folklore, Finnish and
Scandinavian cinema and Finnish Canadian Immigrant Experience. </p>
<p>Our first professors were <b>Börje Vähämäki</b> (1989-2009, 2013-2014) and <b>Pia Päiviö</b> (2009-2013). The current professor, <b>Anu Muhonen </b>(2014- ) is a dynamic teacher and cutting-edge researcher.
The program in Toronto is of top quality and is the largest in North America; to-date
more than 1300 students have benefitted from our Finnish Studies courses in
numerous ways. Many have had life-changing experiences; some have chosen to
major in Finnish Studies.</p>
<p>Finland’s Ambassadors to Canada consistently
praise our program as a significant component of Finland-Canada relations as
evidenced by the fact that <b><i>no less than two</i></b> Presidents of
Finland, <b>Mauno Koivisto</b> (1990) and <b>Sauli Niinistö</b> (2014) have visited our
Finnish Studies Program on <b>official
state visits</b> to Canada. </p>
<p><b>The Goal for 2015-16 is $25,000.</b><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>How Can You Help?</h3> <p></p>
<p>We ask you to do two things: (1) Send
a donation (2) Spread the word to your friends and acquaintances.</p>
<p><b>You as a
Donor.</b> You
can give $10, $25, $50, $100, $200, $500 or more – any amount is welcome. Donors of
$25 and above qualify for a Canadian tax receipt. Please supply name and address.</p>
<p><b>Every
Dollar that You Donate Will Be Matched - Twice.</b> Two individuals, so-called “matching
donors”, have pledged to match your donation, dollar for dollar, each up to a
total of $25,000. This <b>triples</b> the
value of your donation. For example, if you give $100, CFFEF will ultimately
receive $300, and if you donate $500 we get $1500. Matching gifts inspire others.
The total yield following this campaign may reach $75,000. This then leaves funds
for subsequent years and gives us time to secure funds in the future.</p>

   Who Are We? 
CFFEF’s mission is to raise

essential to teach Finnish Studies at the university level. A partnership was
formed between Canada’s leading University, the University of Toronto, and the

    Why Now?  
The
official partnership

then Finland had paid half of the cost
of our Finnish Program. Hence the urgent short
term need therefore is $25,000.

Why Does the Program Need to Be Preserved? 

The Finnish Studies Program serves Finnish
Canadians, and Canadians of all backgrounds on several levels: 



The Finnish Studies Program
represents an impactful and worthy legacy of Finns in Canada;


Finnish Studies is an academic
program of national and international significance;


Finnish Studies is an
increasingly important link in the cultural, educational, and economic
relations between Finland and Canada;


Despite its smallness the Finnish
Studies Program is “a precious piece of the global mosaic.”




Impact


The Finnish Studies Program enriches
the students’ lives, many with life-changing impact. Finland and Canada share
in common the fact that they both



Are northern countries with Arctic concerns;


Are bilingual nations;


Have large and powerful neighbours;


Have strong democratic traditions and share similarities in
social fabric and attitudes.


Yet Finland, its people, and its
culture are unique: 



The Finnish language is unrelated to all Indo-European
languages.


Geographically Finland is and has always been between East
and West, experiencing conflicts and challenges throughout its history.


Finland’s
uniqueness makes it extra interesting and worth learning about.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a 25 yearold self employed IT consultant from New Plymouth, New Zealand. I am wanting to help a close friend finish his first year of University. He has been through a series of unfortunate circumstances that have rendered him unable to afford the last half of his accomodation for the year. If we cannot raise the funds, he will ultimately have to drop out of his accomodation, and ultimately his University studies - which is something I, and many others would hate to see happen.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>I want to try online fundraising as a means of trying to make a positive difference in the tertiary education time of his life. I am seeking around $3000 in order to pay the accomodation apportionment of his first year at Victoria University, Wellington NZ. His student loan is enough to cover his studies, but not enough for the accomodation. </p>
<p>If we don't reach target the money will still be put into a collective fund with other money raised from other means of fundraising.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As he is a student with no continuous income, banks have declined any form of loan as well. It is so hard seeing him go through the fear of being left with nothing when the bill payment date comes toward the end of August. You can help make a difference in his life by contributing to the cause and enabling him to continue his tertiary studies for this year, and hopefully allowing him to continue his study in coming years. It is important that he can still stay in his Hall of Residence that he has spent the first half of the year in, with supportive friends. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please get the word out, share with your friends and family. I will be starting the process with a donation of my own into the fund. If we could get 30 people to donate $100 each it would be incredible!!!</p>

So… they don’t do anything. They’re stuck. Those teens continue to suffer hoping that it’ll go away. But it doesn't. The more we learn about the brain and addiction the more we are realizing the need for professional help when trying to overcome an addiction to pornography. </p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s2"">As we see the many emails that come through we’ve been able to identify the top 3 reasons why teens are not getting the help they need. </span></p>
<ol class=""ol1"">
<li class=""li2""><span class=""s2""><strong>Money</strong>: Most addiction recovery programs out there cost hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars.  Even if a teenager had such funds most of the institutions require a credit card, which is completely out of reach for a teen.</span></li>
<li class=""li2""><span class=""s2""><strong>Parental Consent</strong>: Teens would rather suffer in silence than admit their imperfections to their parents, especially imperfections surrounding such a sensitive topic as pornography.  Most teens that contact us literally believe that their parents will stop loving them and in some cases even physically harm them if they found out.  Of course, those assumptions are most likely inaccurate but given that state of mind it’s understandable why they are unwilling to confront their parents and ask for help.  So they don’t do anything. They’re stuck.  </span></li>
<li class=""li2""><span class=""s2""><strong>Relatable</strong>: Currently there isn’t an online resource that targets and caters to teens.  Most organizations target the parents because they are the ones with the money and the ones choosing the program.  This is helpful for parents who have caught their child and are forcing them to get help.  But what about the teen that chooses to seek help?  If there isn’t a resource out there that’s speaking and targeting them, they won’t respond.</span></li>
</ol><p class=""p3""><strong><span class=""s1""> </span></strong></p>
<h2 class=""p3""><strong><span class=""s1"">SOLUTION:</span></strong></h2>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s2"">Because of the constant cry for help from these young people we knew we had to do something. We needed to figure out a way to eliminate this friction and provide them with a solution today rather than waiting for them to turn 18 and pay for help themselves, or wait until there is a crisis and the damage is already done. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s2"">We are currently in the process of developing a<strong><em> FREE</em> </strong>online teen program, <em>FORTIFY: A Step Towards Recovery</em>. This program will not only give professional education but also tools and resources to assist in overcoming an addiction to pornography. FORTIFY will solve the very reasons why teens weren't getting professional help.</span></p>
<ol class=""ol1"">
<li class=""li2""><span class=""s2""><strong>Money:</strong> Our program will be free.</span></li>
<li class=""li2""><span class=""s2""><strong>Parental Consent:</strong> They can start the program on their own without parental consent.  However, our goal for the program is to help decrease their fear and anxiety of getting a parent or loved one involved.  We will train them in the most effective ways to address it with their parents/loved ones.  Intervention increases recovery more than any other method. </span></li>
<li class=""li11""><span class=""s2""><strong>Relatable:</strong> Research shows that in order for us to be effective with teens you have to be cool first and informative second.  The delivery of the content has to be packaged in a way that will keep their attention and encourage understanding.  That’s why we’re producing short, to-the-point videos that will teach the necessary principles.  These videos will be filled with dynamic graphics, animations, and delivered by a young peer-like individual that will do a far better job of relating than any other authoritative figure. </span></li>
</ol><p class=""p12""><span class=""s2""><strong> </strong></span></p>
<h2 class=""p12""><span class=""s2""><strong>PROJECT ITEMS AND DEADLINES:</strong></span></h2>

<li class=""li2"">
<span class=""s2""><strong>Video/Animation Production:  </strong>Once we have the scripts finished and finalized we will then film and create the videos.

<h2 class=""p2""><span class=""s2""><strong>PRIMARY GOALS FOR FORTIFY:</strong></span></h2>
<ul>
<li class=""p14""><span class=""s2"">Getting a parent or trusted adult involved.</span></li>
<li class=""p14""><span class=""s2"">Helping them understand addiction and provide the proper steps towards recovery including additional resources and tools.</span></li>

<h2 class=""p2""><span class=""s2""><strong>EXPECTED OUTCOMES:</strong></span></h2>
<ul>
<li class=""p14""><span class=""s2"">Teens will receive adequate education and training to help them fully overcome their addiction to pornography.</span></li>
<li class=""p14""><span class=""s2"">Their understanding of what addiction is and how it might harm them will sharpen to a level that will influence positive behaviors. </span></li>
<li class=""p14""><span class=""s2"">They will comprehend the need for the involvement of a loved one and understand that in order for them to fully recover and stay recovered they will likely require continuous and ongoing effort. </span></li>
</ul><p class=""p2""><span class=""s2"">Measurement is key to the success of this program. Built into the Fortify program will be a rigorous measuring tool that will help us gather the necessary data when assessing the progress of each individual student. This will not only help the student know how they’ve progressed but it will also help us better understand where the program is strong and where it is weak. This data will allow us to modify and adjust the program for continuous improvement. </span></p>

We at Fight the New Drug (FTND) continue to receive hundreds of emails from desperate teens looking for help. Some got into it because they just didn’t know any better and others thought they could control their addiction and are now desperate for a way out. 
Here are a just a few examples of the many emails we receive:

Parental Consent: They can start the program on their own without parental consent.  However, our goal for the program is to help decrease their fear and anxiety of getting a parent or loved one involved.  We will train them in the most effective ways to address it with their parents/loved ones.  Intervention increases recovery more than any other method. 
Relatable: Research shows that in order for us to be effective with teens you have to be cool first and informative second.  The delivery of the content has to be packaged in a way that will keep their attention and encourage understanding.  That’s why we’re producing short, to-the-point videos that will teach the necessary principles.  These videos will be filled with dynamic graphics, animations, and delivered by a young peer-like individual that will do a far better job of relating than any other authoritative figure. 
 
PROJECT ITEMS AND DEADLINES:


Content Development:  Our team of professional therapists and neurologists will finalize the content and script development for the 45 lessons in the program by October 1st, 2012. 


FORTIFY Website:  Graphic design, programming, and copywriting for the FORTIFY website is set to be completed on December 15th, 2012.


Video/Animation Production:  Once we have the scripts finished and finalized we will then film and create the videos. These videos will need to be very well produced and executed in order to engage young people. We are partnering with professional animators/videographers to complete this project.  The videos and animation deadline is February 1st, 2013.

 
PRIMARY GOALS FOR FORTIFY:

Getting a parent or trusted adult involved.
Helping them understand addiction and provide the proper steps towards recovery including additional resources and tools.
Help them recognize their own addictive triggers and behaviors as well as the pathway out of their addiction.
 
EXPECTED OUTCOMES:

Teens will receive adequate education and training to help them fully overcome their addiction to pornography.
Their understanding of what addiction is and how it might harm them will sharpen to a level that will influence positive behaviors. 
They will comprehend the need for the involvement of a loved one and understand that in order for them to fully recover and stay recovered they will likely require continuous and ongoing effort. 
Measurement is key to the success of this program. Built into the Fortify program will be a rigorous measuring tool that will help us gather the necessary data when assessing the progress of each individual student. This will not only help the student know how they’ve progressed but it will also help us better understand where the program is strong and where it is weak. This data will allow us to modify and adjust the program for continuous improvement. 
 
FUNDING PLAN
This project is already underway. The website and branding is currently being developed. Here are all budget items: 

Fortify Website:  The website includes design, programming, forums, measurement and database managements systems.   
Total Cost:  $22,000

Content Development:  This includes all scripts and content developed by therapist and neurologist as well as copywriting to transfer complex language to everyday teen language.  This also includes all downloadable tools and resources used through out the program.     
Total Cost:  $24,000

Video/Animation Production:  There are a total of 45 videos; each video is roughly 3-5 minutes in length.  37 of the 45 videos will include animation and graphics.  This piece of the project is by far the most time consuming and technical.  We’ve already raised nearly $25,000 for this budget item but need to raise $35,000 to complete.         
Total Cost:  $35,000         
 
WHAT WE NEED FROM YOU!!
The good news is that we have already raised a good portion of the funds needed. All we need from the INDIEGOGO community is $25,000. We need you! With your help we will be able to help tens of thousands of struggling teenagers overcome their addiction to pornography. Join us in this incredible cause. BECOME A FIGHTER!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The excavations at X'noha will have two real impacts on the world. The first is the basic research that will be gained from the work conducted this summer. One of the great mysteries of the Americas is why the Maya civilization collapsed at the end of the Classic period, around 800 A.D. I have been studying this thoughout my career as an archaeologists and have been able to come to some tentative conclusions.

In a nutshell the Maya were no longer able to feed their population. As we enter an uncertain time with our own resources being stretch I see some of the same societal pressures that the Maya faced mirrored in our own world wide society. By studying what happened in the past we can see some of the challenges that our society will face in the future.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The second impact that my excavations will have is more immediate. Many of our irreplaceable cultural resouces are being lost and destroyed as jungles throughout Central America are cleared for unsustainable industrial scale farming. Just last year an ancient Maya city similar to the one that I will be excavating was destroyed to when land was cleared to make room for more cattle pastures. My excavations will at least temporarily halt any more clearing of the jungle. This will leave intact not only the city but an irreplaceable habitat that is home to two species of monkey, jaguar and other wild cats, deer, peccary, and numerous small animals. I hope that though a combination of personal appeals and community education, I can halt the clearing of this area and leave it wild and safe for future generations.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Lets be honest, excavations are expensive. While many of the projects undertaken by the Maya Research Program (<a href=""http://www.mayaresearchprogram.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.mayaresearchprogram.org</a>) are funded by volunteer contributions, I am starting an large scale excavations that have not been attempted for more than 10 years. I will need funds to pay for everything from wages for our local workers, fuel for our vehicles, to basic tools and supplies. The $5000 that I an trying to raise will not cover all of my expenses, but it will help. I am not asking for any funds to cover my personal expenses, I will cover that myself, but I do need to raise enough funds to cover the excavation expenses at least in part. any funds will help, and the more that I can raise means that my excavations can be more extensive.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am hoping to hire at least 5 workers from the nearby town of San Felipe. This alone will require a capital outlay of $5000. We pay the highest wages for skilled archaeological workers in the area, $20 per worker for eight full weeks. In addition I estimate that that my fuel and vehicle maintenance expenses for the summer will top $1000. I have not even added in the essential materials that an excavation of this scale requires. We Will need tarps to protect the exposed buildings, replacement tools (picks, shovels, buckets, and the like). Treats for my team, everyone likes a cookie break in the morning.

Just this year, the government (CONAFE) sent 4 different teacher volunteers into the community. This leaves students with an insufficient number of class days and eliminates any sense of trust and continuity between young children and their educators. We aim to fix this issue by building a living quarter for the teacher on school grounds and providing a salary to support his/her living expenses. These improvements will ensure lengthier teacher involvement within the community.</span></p>

What’s Happening:
San Antonio de Rioyos, Mexico
 
Our outreach team has been working with mothers in San Antonio de Rioyos,  a small rural town in Guanajuato, Mexico,  to identify ways to improve their local kindergarten and provide education for the community’s youth. 
 
    ““Sometimes, I imagine I am a little girl, and that I have to come here and sit down inside this classroom. It makes me want to cry.” 
                                                           ~Doña Adela, grandmother
 

 
These vivacious children come to kindergarten while their parents work in the fields. However, the community does not have the resources to sustain the volunteer teacher, fund books, or buy toys. The cramped classroom lacks water and electricity. Without a stable teacher or proper classroom, the children are mostly illiterate, unable to grasp basic mathematical concepts, and unprepared to continue their education in the nearby towns.
 
IN NUMBERS:
* 1/5 children attend the local kindergarten* * 85% drop out before completing middle school*
* Virtually NO high school completion*
* 80% of teens cannot find employment*
* Poor educational quality, school fees, transportation costs, bullying, and lack of perceived opportunity are all quoted reasons for discontinuing education*
 
Let’s Break it Down - Where the 11k goes:
   
 We have the land, a water source, a teacher, and many eager parents and children. Furthermore, we have partnered with individuals at the American School Foundation of Guadalajara for teacher training and donated curriculum. All we need now is the funding to translate our goals for educational improvement into reality:
 
1) $2,500 Teacher’s Salary
2) $3,500 School Refurbishment
* Larger Kindergarten Classroom * Electricity* Tables and Chairs * On-Site Living Quarters for Teacher * Garden * Soccer Field 
3) $2,100 Education Materials
        * Books * Computers * Art supplies* Creative learning puzzles* Sport
Equipment
4) $2,000 Nutrition
        *Healthy breakfast of local bananas, milk, crackers
5) $876 Others
        * Community Engagement projects* IRS Application Fee to become 501-C3
In the case we do not meet full funding, we will postpone the others section.
 
 

 
The Project Details:
 
FTDO will revitalize San Antonio de Rioyos’ kindergarten by focusing on 4 main issues:
 
1) “Bien aprende quien buen maestro tiene”: Teacher Transiency
(The one who learns well is the one who has a good teacher -- popular refrain)
 
     
Currently, the kindergarten cannot recruit and retain its kindergarten teachers. Just this year, the government (CONAFE) sent 4 different teacher volunteers into the community. This leaves students with an insufficient number of class days and eliminates any sense of trust and continuity between young children and their educators. We aim to fix this issue by building a living quarter for the teacher on school grounds and providing a salary to support his/her living expenses. These improvements will ensure lengthier teacher involvement within the community.
 
 2) A Place to Learn, a Place to Play: Schoolhouse Refurbishment
          
The current kindergarten made of gray concrete walls and two adjoining desks does not provide a conducive atmosphere for 4-6 year old children to learn, play, and grow. We will revitalize the current classroom by expanding the size to accommodate 25 students, adding electricity, painting the walls a vibrant color to cover the grey concrete, planting a garden, and making a futból field. In so doing, the children will have the learning environment they need to grow into well-rounded individuals.  
 
3) Books, puzzles, and toys, oh my!: Educational Materials
                 
The kids are tired of reading the same disintegrating books over and over again. We will provide computers that have educational videos and games, along with new reading books, pens, paper, and arts and crafts supplies. By making learning fun, we aim to improve their literacy rates, basic mathematical concepts, and writing abilities. 
 
4) No more rumbling in my tummy: Nutrition
         
The intense poverty in San Antonio de Rioyos is manifested in the community’s lack of access to basic food.  The children come to school without having had breakfast. Although they have a break to go home for lunch, they often remain at school because their parents cannot afford to provide them with an afternoon meal. To shift the kids’ focus from their rumbling tummies to solving “1+1” in the classroom, FTDO will introduce a nutrition program that starts bright and early: we will give kids a healthy breakfast of local milk, bananas, and whole grain crackers.
 
 
 
YOUR IMPACT:   
         
Every donation, big or small, will go exclusively toward the revitalization of the kindergarten in San Antonio de Rioyos. 
 
By June 2014, all donations will be matched 5X by Fair Trade Social premiums provided by Fair Trade company Organic Alliance, Inc, so that we can continue the work that you start!
 
 
        
 
 
 
All of your support for this campaign does not only revitalize the community’s kindergarten, but also lays the foundation for our subsequent goal of creating a digital learning and recreation center, elementary, middle and high schools. These multi-phase projects make up La Esquina de la Educación. Together, we can build more than a kindergarten. We can build an entire movement toward quality education for the area.

We started as characters for the Chesterton Wizard of Oz Festival and, 
over time, expanded our audience by appearing at numerous events such as
 The Indianapolis 500 Kids Festival, The Indiana State Fair, 
Oz-Stravaganza! (2009) in Chittenango, and many more.  We also donate 
our services to charitible organizations and children's hospitals. <br/><br/>In September of 2013, we were contracted as the Official Characters for Warner Bros. 75th Anniversary celebration of <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> in Hollywood, California. This appearance snagged us a spot on <i>Entertainment Tonight </i>and multiple media outlines (print, video, and web) including <i>Yahoo! Movies</i> and <i>The Daily Mail UK</i>. <br/><br/><p>Many costumed character groups simply show up and pose for photos, 
our group does much more than that!  We sing and dance, we emcee events -
 basically we strive to make our characters as much a part of an event 
as possible.  We love spending one-on-one time with attendees - 
chatting, playing games, whatever we can do to make the event as special
 as possible. </p>
<h3>This Campaign</h3>
<p>This campaign is to help send us to Oz-Stravaganza in Chittenango, 
New York, this summer.  This event is held in the hometown of L. Frank 
Baum, the author of the Wizard of Oz, and celebrates all things Oz!  We 
last appeared at this event in 2009.  We had an awesome time and have 
wanted to return ever since; with this summer marking the 75th Anniversary of the film and the International Wizard of Oz Club holding their national convention in conjunction with this festival, there is no better time!  Unfortunately, the trip can be quite 
costly and if hard for us to cover.  The event organizers also love 
having us, but with everything they have on their plate, it is not 
always possible for them to provide the financial support we need.  We 
are asking that you consider contributing to our cause and helping us 
get to Chittenango so that we may provide the families, fans, and 
children with quality entertainment with a touch of magic!</p>
<p>
</p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>A trip such as this has many expenses including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gas - Like with all trips, we need fuel for our vehicles and in today's economy it can be killer!</li>
<li>Hotels - Hotels are one of the more costly aspects of our trips.  
While we bunk about 4 to a room, it is still rather costly, as we must 
worry about hotels not only at the event but also on the way to and 
from. </li>
<li>Costume Maintenance - We typically do 5-10 events per year.  With 
all the moving, dancing, marching in parades, repeated packing and 
unpacking, and so on, our costumes take quite a good deal of wear and 
tear.  This requires periodic maintenance, cleaning, and, after so many 
years, replacement eventually.  Also, new makeup must be bought every so
 often. </li>
<li>Misc. Expenses - Even ""fictional"" characters must eat.  We must also
 keep certain things on hand such as bottled water, first aid kit, etc.</li>
</ul><p>As you look below, you will notice we have various sponsorship levels
 with varying incentives.  While you may give any amount from $1.00 and 
up, these levels provide you with several great great perks including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advertisement on Facebook page</li>
<li>Name/Business listed on our cast t-shirt</li>
<li>Autographed photos</li>
<li>Advertisement at the event</li>
<li>An appearance by the characters at your event/business</li>
<li>Much more</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>
</p><h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Think of the joy you can help bring to countless children by helping 
send the characters to Oz-Stravaganza.  You should see their faces light
 up when they meet Dorothy and friends for the first time!  You are also helping the not-for-profit organization who runs the festival, by helping them bring more entertainment to the event with very little out-of-pocket expense.  The International Wizard of Oz Club will also benefit as the characters will be available for their national convention taking place in conjunction with Oz-Stravaganza!</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
Financial donations are not the only way you can help.  You or your 
business may also provide assistance in one of the following ways:<p></p>
<ul>
<li>In-kind donations of snacks, bottled, water, etc.</li>
<li>Business in the area may help to provide food and lodging.</li>
<li>Help spread the word of our campaign!</li>
<li>Vouchers, coupons, and discounts for our various expenses.</li>

Baum, the author of the Wizard of Oz, and celebrates all things Oz!  We 
last appeared at this event in 2009.  We had an awesome time and have 
wanted to return ever since; with this summer marking the 75th Anniversary of the film and the International Wizard of Oz Club holding their national convention in conjunction with this festival, there is no better time!  Unfortunately, the trip can be quite 
costly and if hard for us to cover.  The event organizers also love 
having us, but with everything they have on their plate, it is not 
always possible for them to provide the financial support we need.  We 
are asking that you consider contributing to our cause and helping us 
get to Chittenango so that we may provide the families, fans, and 
children with quality entertainment with a touch of magic!

What We Need & What You Get
A trip such as this has many expenses including:

Gas - Like with all trips, we need fuel for our vehicles and in today's economy it can be killer!
Hotels - Hotels are one of the more costly aspects of our trips.  
While we bunk about 4 to a room, it is still rather costly, as we must 
worry about hotels not only at the event but also on the way to and 
from. 
Costume Maintenance - We typically do 5-10 events per year.  With 
all the moving, dancing, marching in parades, repeated packing and 
unpacking, and so on, our costumes take quite a good deal of wear and 
tear.  This requires periodic maintenance, cleaning, and, after so many 
years, replacement eventually.  Also, new makeup must be bought every so
 often. 
Misc. Expenses - Even ""fictional"" characters must eat.  We must also
 keep certain things on hand such as bottled water, first aid kit, etc.
As you look below, you will notice we have various sponsorship levels
 with varying incentives.  While you may give any amount from $1.00 and 
up, these levels provide you with several great great perks including:

Advertisement on Facebook page
Name/Business listed on our cast t-shirt
Autographed photos
Advertisement at the event
An appearance by the characters at your event/business
Much more


The Impact
Think of the joy you can help bring to countless children by helping 
send the characters to Oz-Stravaganza.  You should see their faces light
 up when they meet Dorothy and friends for the first time!  You are also helping the not-for-profit organization who runs the festival, by helping them bring more entertainment to the event with very little out-of-pocket expense.  The International Wizard of Oz Club will also benefit as the characters will be available for their national convention taking place in conjunction with Oz-Stravaganza!


Other Ways You Can Help
Financial donations are not the only way you can help.  You or your 
business may also provide assistance in one of the following ways:

In-kind donations of snacks, bottled, water, etc.
Business in the area may help to provide food and lodging.
Help spread the word of our campaign!
Vouchers, coupons, and discounts for our various expenses.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>     Hello, my name is Ariel. Growing up I was surrounded by people of many cultures. As a child with unbridled curiosity, I was constantly seeking to learn about others of different cultures. I believe interacting with others different from myself can expand my point of view of the world. Unfortunately, my curiosity now has been limited to the boundaries of the U.S. Throughout my youth, I have had to provide for myself, which includes paying for my schooling. As a result, financial constraints have stifled my plans to travel. Fortunately, a friend of mine recently told me about a wonderful program where I would be able to travel, while serving others along the way. The program is called Interexchange, which provides an outlet for people such as myself to explore the world and partake in a life-changing international experience. Thus, fostering my cultural and social understanding of those different from myself. For one year I will be a mentor to and teach children from indigent families English. <br/><br/>    Nevertheless, I will not be the only individual reaping the benefits from this program. The children I will be working with will also gain an opportunity to learn about someone different from themselves. It is my hope that we will both be able to teach and learn from each other. <br/><br/>    With your help I will finally be able to live out my dreams and hopefully impact the lives of children.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>

<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>    I have been blessed to receive assistance, guidance and wisdom from many influential people in my life. I believe it’s my obligation to extend the same compassion and encouragement to someone less fortunate. Just think of how many children do not have access to good education and lack positive role models in their lives. By donating what you can, you are not only helping me, but you become part of a bigger picture. You’re helping a child grow into a future contributing member of society. Help me help them I really want to be apart of the change don't you? Let’s make a change together! <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>    Currently, I am working two jobs to try and come up with the remainder of the amount I will need. I have already depleted my savings and am working hard to fill this gap.  However, I am still short on my goal. I will need a total of $4,000. This amount will cover:<br/><br/></p>
<ul><li>A round trip ticket to my destination (France) ≈ $1,300 USD</li></ul>
<ul><li>Required program laptop (I will be using this for lesson plans) ≈ $500 USD</li></ul>
<ul><li>Teaching materials (activity books, grade books, learning CD/ROMs, dry erase boards, etc.) ≈ $500 USD</li></ul>
<ul><li>School program fee ≈ $498 USD</li></ul>
<ul><li>Health Insurance fee for the year ≈ $500 USD</li></ul>
<ul><li>Visa &amp; Visa tax ≈ $607 USD<br/>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey there, I need your help! I'm hoping to travel with the charity Performers Without Borders (<a href=""http://performerswithoutborders.org.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://performerswithoutborders.org.uk</a>) to Nicaragua for three months (10 January to 10 April 2013). PWB teaches performing arts to vunerable children in countries of high child poverty.</p>
<p>I am strong proponent of social circus. I completed PWB's 2007/8 tour in India and two tours in Thailand (2009 and 2010) with a similar charity called Spark Circus. I think teaching underprivileged children circus skills is a great way to encourage them to play for the sake of playing while also giving them attention and reminding them that anything's possible. Furthermore it helps develop an individual's learning and teamworking skills while fostering creativity and self confidence.</p>
<p>For the previous tours I've been on I have bought my own flight and covered the majority of my own expenses. However, this year I cannot afford to do so, but I still desperately want to go and teach circus in Nicaragua. Please can you help me raise the money? </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>I will need $1300 for my flight and $1,600 to cover all my food, accommodation and transport costs whilst in the country. Then any other money I make will go straight to PWB to buy equipment to leave with the children and other important things for the project to take place.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>For the past year and a half I have been working on a federally funded project as Community Interventions Coordinator. In my role, I have engaged, trained, and supported a network of 10 organizations across the city of Chicago who were implementing 4 community level interventions aimed at creating healthier environments in their neighborhoods. The intervention focus areas were Healthy Schools, Healthy Corner Stores, Breastfeeding Support, and Neighborhood Walkability. Our funding period has come to an end, and I am left contemplating my next steps.</p>
<p>As many of you know I am extremely passionate about supporting women and their families in making holistic and informed decisions around the physical, mental and emotional health of their families- especially during pregnancy, as they prepare for birth, and during breastfeeding.</p>
<p>The next logical step for me on my journey is to position myself to better support women in my community. I am interested in becoming a Certified Lactation Counselor (CLC).</p>
<p>Over the past two years, I have already provided peer to peer breastfeeding support to many women. I would like to increase my knowledge base as well as my capacity to ensure that I am providing the most accurate, up to date, and relevant information and resources to the women I serve.</p>
<p><br/>Many women that I have interacted with who have not met their initial breastfeeding goals, have stated that some of the main barriers they experienced were: </p>
<ul>
<li>lack of access to support after leaving the hospital</li>
<li>lack of support in their home, work, and personal life</li>
<li>and not knowing that the challenges they were experiencing were common and could've been overcome if they had the aforementioned support</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon becoming a CLC some of my goals are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>offer breastfeeding 101 classes for women and their families,</li>
<li>facilitate breastfeeding support groups</li>
<li>create an online space for breastfeeding support</li>
<li>conduct one on one breastfeeding support sessions for moms post partum</li>
</ul>
<p>My target demographic will women who are underserved by lactation support including but not limited to Black and Brown moms, teens, unemployed, un/under insured, etc.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>I am looking to raise $900 to use towards costs associate with a CLC training course.</p>
<p>The Healthy Children Project will be conducting a training in the Chicagoland area in the middle of October, and I need your HELP with the following: </p>
<p><strong>$725.00- Tuition</strong></p>
<p><strong>$55.00- Required Books</strong></p>
<p><strong>$120- Additional Books and materials to support my journey</strong></p>
<p>If I am unable to raise the funds to attend the training, the money will be spent on purchasing books, and other materials that will assist me in increasing my knowledge, and I will seek out other opportunities for professional development in the field.</p>
<p>Depending on how close I get, I may be able to supplement the remainder and register for the course the next time they are in the area.</p>
<p>If I raise extra funds, the excess will be used towards planting seeds to implement one or more of the above goals.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The benefits of breastfeeding are immense. And there is a need in our communities for an increase in lactation professionals, especially those who can relate to women from underserved and traditionally marginalized demographics in a way that people outside of our communities can not. There is a stigma that Black women do not breastfeed. I want to challenge that stereotype by being a walking, talking, breastfeeding example and a source of support and information for mothers who are interested in breastfeeding, breastfeeding, or unsure about whether or not breastfeeding is the right choice for their family.</p>
<p>It is not my intention to judge or down women for not choosing to breastfeed. In fact, I wish to present information in as clear, relatable, and concise way to help moms feel comfortable and confident with their infant feeding decisions.</p>

We will invite women and other minority groups in tech to apply and the program allows them to thrive. Please reach out to us in the links below to help us achieve this! :)</span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"">Update - Why am I ineligible for a tourist visa? I'm an unmarried 19 year old woman with no kids.</h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">A number of people have emailed me enquiring about my ineligibility, so I thought I could explain here. I applied for a tourist visa for the first time and got a really fast denial. The consular said, ""You are in your gap year... I'm sorry"". A gap year is the time in between high school and university. I am to start college in September. My persistent self and supporters went ahead to reapply for the same visa, believing I was eligible. I got support letters from Hacker School, AdaCamp SF (I was to be a participant), GNOME Outreach Program for Women, Codecademy community manager, Madison Ruby, my mentor from the Apache Deltacloud Project, and my partners in Kenya. During my second visa interview, I got a really nice consular who explained that the problem is not with support documentation or funds - it was with me. The consular said, and I quote, ""You need social ties to Kenya. And now that you're an adult - I'm 19 - your parents do not count"". This basically translates to I'm ineligible because I am an  unmarried 19 year old with no kids, not in her 3rd year of University, and has not worked for a company or the government for many years. I need these ""social ties"" to tie me to Kenya. I'm certain my friends do not count as ""social ties"". ;)</p>

So I am starting a Dev School in Nairobi to give myself and numerous young East Africans a chance to learn, improve their programming skills, and build awesome technology for Africa. I am really excited about this because I still get to ""become a better programmer"" this summer while teaching and helping others also.</span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>The Impact - Help create more success stories!</span></h3>

There are so many young Kenyans with degrees who are misplaced in the job market or simply cannot find decent jobs. There are even more young potential entrepreneurs willing to learn and/or improve their skills. Through the Nairobi Dev School, these young people will get a chance to improve their skills or learn new skills while building job-creating technology. In our plans most will end up employing themselves while creating employment for others.</span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>Shiko - How I got into code...</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>""I studied biochemistry in  university. I have worked in sales and marketing, project management and other random paper pushing jobs which had little or nothing to do with tech. When Martha first introduced me to programming, I was skeptical because I thought programming was all binary code which is something i was not remotely interested in.  She gave me books on html and css. Out of curiosity i read them. And that was it, I was sucked in for life! I love web design and self learning is so mind blowing.I mean i was like a kid with a new toy. I could wake up at four in the morning to do a simple mock up, play with different backgrounds and fonts and i get sooo happy. Btw i have only been learning for a month now as I write this. I quit my job two weeks ago to become a full time learner of code. My first project is my personal site, I am working on the mock up on photoshop. I also plan to build a platform for learning and teaching on ruby on rails with Martha. Nothing else matters to me at this point other than learning web design ,development and other ""stuff"" that will make me successful in life. Thanks to Martha and the Nairobi Dev School there is hope for life learners and tech visionaries like me!""</span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span> What is the money for?</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The money we raise in this campaign will be used to </span><span>set up the Dev School and run it for almost year! I have a budget of about $5000 a month</span><span>. The money will be used for:</span></p>

<li>Volunteer stipends.</li>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>These are the basics things needed to learn, but unfortunately, are not accessible to most (almost all!) of Africans. So providing them at the school is the only way to ensure the school is an equal opportunity for all! :)</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Nairobi Dev School will be a space for learners to come in and program awesome stuff using online tools. There will be optional Ruby on Rails classes (taught by me), and the rest will be self-learning and collaborative learning!</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>I need the funds to start it because the school will be free. Anyone who applies will attend the school for 3 months for free. This is the same experience I was going to get at Hacker school, and I want others to enjoy the same!</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The funds will be used to get space, an Internet connection, electricity and any suppport services for the Dev School. I already raised more than $5000 from my previous campaign.

Through the Nairobi Dev School, these young people will get a chance to improve their skills or learn new skills while building job-creating technology. In our plans most will end up employing themselves while creating employment for others.
Shiko - How I got into code...
""I studied biochemistry in  university. I have worked in sales and marketing, project management and other random paper pushing jobs which had little or nothing to do with tech. When Martha first introduced me to programming, I was skeptical because I thought programming was all binary code which is something i was not remotely interested in.  She gave me books on html and css. Out of curiosity i read them. And that was it, I was sucked in for life! I love web design and self learning is so mind blowing.I mean i was like a kid with a new toy. I could wake up at four in the morning to do a simple mock up, play with different backgrounds and fonts and i get sooo happy. Btw i have only been learning for a month now as I write this. I quit my job two weeks ago to become a full time learner of code. My first project is my personal site, I am working on the mock up on photoshop. I also plan to build a platform for learning and teaching on ruby on rails with Martha. Nothing else matters to me at this point other than learning web design ,development and other ""stuff"" that will make me successful in life. Thanks to Martha and the Nairobi Dev School there is hope for life learners and tech visionaries like me!""
 What is the money for?
The money we raise in this campaign will be used to set up the Dev School and run it for almost year! I have a budget of about $5000 a month. The money will be used for:


Renting out a space for the school.


Fast-speed internet connection.


Electricity for the school.


Buying chairs and desks and any other furniture in the beginning.


Buying laptops for participants.


Financial support to participants.  


Snacks during the program.

Volunteer stipends.
 
These are the basics things needed to learn, but unfortunately, are not accessible to most (almost all!) of Africans. So providing them at the school is the only way to ensure the school is an equal opportunity for all! :)
Nairobi Dev School will be a space for learners to come in and program awesome stuff using online tools. There will be optional Ruby on Rails classes (taught by me), and the rest will be self-learning and collaborative learning!
I need the funds to start it because the school will be free. Anyone who applies will attend the school for 3 months for free. This is the same experience I was going to get at Hacker school, and I want others to enjoy the same!
The funds will be used to get space, an Internet connection, electricity and any suppport services for the Dev School. I already raised more than $5000 from my previous campaign. I am using this to start out Nairobi Dev School, as I look for more funds to keep it runnning.
How else can I help?
