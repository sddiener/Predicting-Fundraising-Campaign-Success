<p>For many recovering addicts it’s in rehab they discover there are often musical triggers to their abuse, (the songs associated with using) and then they have to learn how to avoid those triggers that are essentially the soundtrack to their addiction. We’re hoping through Indiegogo we can raise the money we need to produce an album and also get started developing a website to help recovering addicts begin their own Soundtrax 2 Recovery: A collection of songs to help heal and bring hope to the recovering addict.<br/>Last year, some addiction recovery sponsors found out that John Batdorf and I were working on a project with the working title of 12 songs for 12 steps and asked if we'd do a concert for several recovering addicts. Turns out it was about 700 addicts and their families who attended. The concert gave John and I a chance to see if our songs made a difference with the audience. We were overwhelmed with the feedback we got that evening. The show received a tremendous response, people waiting in line for nearly an hour to thank us, and after receiving several hand written notes from addicts at the show saying ""please hurry and get these songs recorded” we realized that the need was great and the urgency even greater.<br/>John and I are singer/songwriters with a passion to let the power of music help people trying to change. We’ve been wearing out our lives the last forty plus years as professional songwriters hoping to make a difference. Although we understand we're not the only guys who have songs that could help, we want to get the ball rolling. We've got an entire album of songs written and ready to be recorded. <br/>When the album is completed we're planning to get a website set up that we’re calling SoundTrax2Recovery where we can eventually provide a sort of ""clearing house"" for songs that help and inspire people trying to overcome their addictions. Doing the album is the first step in realizing our goal. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 180px;""><strong>            WHY US?</strong></p>
<p>One of the reasons we are passionate about doing this project is because it’s hit very close to home. In each of our families we’ve seen the devastation that comes from addiction, in any of its forms. We’ve worked our entire professional careers in a business where all too often substance abuse, drugs and alcohol, and any other form of addiction has destroyed lives. We’re not trained therapists, we don’t have degrees in social work, but we know what we’ve seen and we want to do what we can. Writing songs aimed at penetrating hearts is something we can do. And getting these songs recorded and made available for those who need them most is more important to us than simply searching for yet another way to climb up the music charts</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 180px;""><strong>          WHY HURRY?</strong></p>
<p>Somewhere at this very moment there’s an addict trying to hold on a few more hours until his next AA meeting, or her next appointment with a sponsor, and it feels like aneternity. If we hurry we might be able to offer a little help, even when we can’t physically be there for them. You might be thinking, “come on, it’s only a song”. But it’s more than that. If someone somewhere can hear a song tell them the truth the only way their heart will hear it, maybe then they’ll know, deep down, they’re not alone.</p></div>","WHAT IT IS

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Greetings from the <a href=""http://www.jasonyostband.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Jason Yost Band</a>. I am so very grateful to have this opportunity to produce my very first EP. It has been a long time coming indeed. For the past eleven years I have traveled and played music
in all different types of venues and cultures. I never once felt the timing was
right to produce my own album, until now! I always wanted to create an album that didn't just move people's emotions, but one that moved people's actions. So I had this idea…what if I gathered up all my experiences
and reflections from music and travels over the past eleven years and
interweaved them into a lyrical movement that created a rhythm, not just a
rhythm that is identified by sound, but also one that is identified by deeds?</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Here is the best part: After the release of my EP ""Rescue Me"", I am going to give away all the music sales to help fund adoptions and orphan projects. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>You can be a part of the behind the scenes production right now!  </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This album has no time limit as far as its effectiveness goes. Every time someone purchases the album they are directly investing in helping an orphan find a safe and loving family. That can happen this year or ten years from now. The return on investment has the potential to outlive you and I. Investors will also have the opportunity to join us on trips and volunteer at concerts to further their investment in caring for orphans.  Together we can utilize our abilities and resources to make a big impact in the life of a child and have a lot of fun while we do it!</p>

<h3>NEW PERK ADDED - GREAT HOLIDAY GIFT!  An insiders tour of Juilliard for your family!  Check it out and share with families!</h3>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Welcome to my Indiegogo campaign!  </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">I am a professional freelance violist living in New York City at an exciting point in my career - I am about to purchase a viola for the first time! The relationship between a string player and their instrument is key - and that relationship is <em>anything</em> but free.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">For more than a decade, I was lucky enough to play on a beautiful 19th century French viola on loan from a foundation. I grew up with this instrument and became very emotionally connected to the sound that I produced with it.

The Project
Welcome to my Indiegogo campaign!  
I am a professional freelance violist living in New York City at an exciting point in my career - I am about to purchase a viola for the first time! The relationship between a string player and their instrument is key - and that relationship is anything but free.
For more than a decade, I was lucky enough to play on a beautiful 19th century French viola on loan from a foundation. I grew up with this instrument and became very emotionally connected to the sound that I produced with it. When I had to return the viola to the foundation, I felt like I was losing a part of myself and my musical voice. I had just completed my Masters at Juilliard and was left without the right instrument to turn my degree into a career.  

I had my heart set on finding the perfect old instrument; one that  was small enough to play on comfortably, with a “small” enough price tag to match. Old instruments cost anywhere from 50 to 100 thousand dollars, all the way up to the millions of dollars. So, I started thinking outside of the box and considered the world of contemporary instruments.  
That is when I discovered Guy Rabut, one of the most respected modern instrument makers. I was immediately enamored with his instruments and decided that I wanted Guy to make me a viola.
The simple goal of this campaign is to crowdfund the purchase of my new Guy Rabut viola.

On the most basic level, your contributions will help me purchase this world class instrument that will grow with me throughout my career. But on a more significant level, this campaign will connect me to all of you: friends, family, colleagues and even some total strangers that may choose to be a part of this musical journey.

 cabinets, and heads.  To protect those, because if one of them
 goes down its like a thousand dollars going out the door, So we need to
 be able to protect our gear while we're on tour.  We have a
 lot of our own stuff.  We've worked to get our own endorsements, so we 
have companies that are backing us up - but we still need a few 
different things.  <br/><br/>And, you'll be helping us on 
the record too.  We'll be working with Rocky Gray, formerly of 
Evanescence, to get a record out to you guys - hopefully sometime mid 
summer.<br/><br/>Because, the bottom line is - that we're gonna be out there
 to take the music to YOU.  We're willing to make the trip.  We're 
already doing shows within 6-8 hours of our location; on our own dime;

 to record our full length album and go on tour, so we can get the things that we need.  We have a lot of
 stuff that we have acquired on our own over the years, but, there are 
certain things that we need to be able to bring the right show to YOU 
and we need your HELP. 
           What We Need & What You GetWe
 just got a distribution deal with Select-O-Hits and we're looking to 
get some things taken care of so we're gonna talk to you guys about that and
 see what you think about it....if you wanna be a part of something, we're trying to let you be a part of our family, be on 'Team Harvest Mill'.  We
 have a lot of good perks that you'll be able to look at on the side 
over here -> I think its on this side....its on the side? Yeah, its on the
 side -> of the webpage as you look at it, all whole 'crap ton' full of 
Perks -> You guys will be able to get stuff like EPs, T-Shirts.                     We'll
 have a couple Cymbals up that you can go for.  We'll have a guitar, and  merch packs that you're gonna see on there, but we'll have 
some other stuff too. We'll even throw a perk in there; that if you 
give us a certain amount;  we'll put your name in the album...Its gonna 
be called 'Flesh N Pain'.                              We
 have an EP out right now, that you can go get; on iTunes, Amazon MP3 
and other download places  - but, that will also be INCLUDED in some of our perks 
too.                         The ImpactThe biggest thing is that we need help for is getting some equipment to take care of ourselves.  Like our Egnater
 cabinets, and heads.  To protect those, because if one of them
 goes down its like a thousand dollars going out the door, So we need to
 be able to protect our gear while we're on tour.  We have a
 lot of our own stuff.  We've worked to get our own endorsements, so we 
have companies that are backing us up - but we still need a few 
different things.  And, you'll be helping us on 
the record too.  We'll be working with Rocky Gray, formerly of 
Evanescence, to get a record out to you guys - hopefully sometime mid 
summer.Because, the bottom line is - that we're gonna be out there
 to take the music to YOU.  We're willing to make the trip.  We're 
already doing shows within 6-8 hours of our location; on our own dime; 
to get out their and do this.                                We wanna bring YOU GUYS our music. We're
 doing this independently.  We don't have a label.  And, HELL, you guys 
help us out who knows if that would change.  We could end up  getting a label and
 that would be ALL because YOU GUYS helped us out with this record and 
this tour.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can't contribute; or can contribute, but want to lend additional help; please be sure to Share this Campaign.  Tell

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Danielle French- I am a singer/songwriter based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada (but Reno, Nevada also calls me a local, more on that later...) .</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I have been creating music and producing CD's since 1995 and in the span of my career so far I have had the supreme pleasure of working with some of my favourite musicians in the world. Artists such as Burton Cummings (The Guess Who), Matthew Good, Martin Tielli (Rheostatics) and members of Blue Rodeo, Spirit of the West, as well as members of Sarah McLachlan, Mae Moore and Barney Bentall's bands have all leant their talents to my previous projects. Career highlights include performing on the Rita McNeil Show and at the Calgary leg of Lilith Fair, as well as having my songs appear on TV shows including Falcon Beach and Fashion Television.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>As an independent artist these days, it is necessary for you to not only be the creative/artistic person, but also the business person in your artistic career. Over the past 17 years I have independently handled both the creative aspects of my career as well as the business aspects of my career, acting as my own booking agent, booking my own tours throughout North America, doing my own publicity and marketing, and driving across North America performing in venues from coffee shops to soft seat theatres to night clubs to opening for artists such as Holly Cole, Burton Cummings and the Barenaked Ladies to name a few! </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I feel very fortunate to be an artist in Canada as Canada is very supportive of their artists and there are several grant programs available to support various artistic endeavours. Although it is a very competitive process, I am happy to say that I did receive a grant that contributed partial funding towards the recording costs on my upcoming CD, Drive. But having now reached pressing stage of this project, I find my resources are tapped after spending 2 months in Reno, Nevada, where I recording with my dream record producer, Tom Gordon. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>It has been a dream of mine to work with Tom since I met him almost 10 years ago, when I toured through Reno (when Reno first adopted me as a local!). Tom used to be the assistant engineer at a studio called Granny's House which saw major label artists such as Dr. Dre, Willie Nelson, Whitesnake, Boys II Men and Collective Soul come through their doors. I have always wanted to work creatively with Tom and felt an amazing synergy with him in the studio! Tom connected me with local Reno band The Novelists as my backing band in the studio and drummer Tony Savage (of Englebert Humperdink's band) rounded out the rhythm section. I am very proud of what came out of our recording sessions and can't wait to share it with the world! </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Drive is a series of songs that were inspired by my many years touring throughout North America- songs about freedom, adventure, and of course heartache. Where my last CD was more experimental in nature, on Drive I longed to return to my roots as a singer/songwriter and create a more organic sound. And I am hoping that with a title like ""Drive"" that I will have much more touring opportunities in the New Year to bring my music across the continent. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The reality is that this project will move forward no matter what! If I have to take out RRSP's or money on my line of credit, this project will be realized! I am almost looking at this IndieGogo campaign as a pre-sales outlet... It is common for independent artists to raise money to press their projects by asking fans to ""pre-buy"" their music (ie. buy a copy of their product before it was pressed), to help off-set the costs of pressing the product. The album or CD is then sent to the supporter after the project was pressed. Tools like IndieGogo, now assist artists with these sorts of campaigns in our technological era- Thanks IndieGogo! </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My fundraising goal for pressing 1,000 CD's is $1500 (for anyone who inquires I would be happy to provide a breakdown of how this number was achieved). If I receive less than that amount, I will personally do what I need to do to make up the difference! Should I receive MORE that this amount, please know that once the CD is pressed, there are many other expenses such as marketing, touring, promotion etc... that will encompass my next phase of fundraising. Any funds that surpass my $1200 target will be directly funnelled back into promotion phase for this project and I would be happy to provide full disclosure of expenses and allocation of any additional funds to anyone who requests.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Certainly there are perks for all contributors!</p>
<p>- For all contributions up to $15- I will send you an autographed copy of my new CD, Drive. The purposes of this campaign is to share my music with you all, so I appreciate any contribution level no matter how small and will be happy to send a copy of the new CD to you. </p>
<p>- For contributions between $16-24- I will send you 2 autographed copies of my new CD, Drive</p>
<p>- For contributions between $25-49- I will send you 2 autographed copies of my new CD, Drive, plus 1 copy of each of my CD's released since 1995 (5 CD's total) </p>
<p>- For contributions between $50-499- I will send you 1 autographed copy of each of my CD's released since 1995 (4 CD's total), plus copies of my 3 music videos that I produced/directed, that have appears on Bravo! and at film festivals around the world. </p>
<p>- For contributions between of $500-4999- I will send you 1 autographed copy of each of my CD's released since 1995 (4 CD's total), plus copies of my 3 music videos that I produced/directed, plus, if you live in North America and it is feasible for me to do so on one of  my tour route, I will gladly provide you with a private 2 hour concert in your home, or, if possible, a venue of your choice. <br/></p>
<p>- For contributions of $5000 and over- I will send you 1 autographed copy of each of my CD's released since 1995 (4 CD's total), plus copies of my 3 music videos that I produced/directed, plus, if you live in North America, I will fly you to Reno at the end of August/early September, give you a tour of the studio in Reno where I recorded Drive and a chance to meet my producer Tom Gordon and I will buy you a ticket to the annual Burning Man Festival (end August, early September 2012, <a href=""http://www.burningman.com)*"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.burningman.com)*</a> and show you around Burning Man in the Black Rock Desert.* disclaimer- I will buy you a ticket to the festival and help you with logistics and advice and as much fun as I can, but all other travel, accommodation and living expenses are up to you. </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: justify;""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000066"">We are Nobody Yet</font></h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">What's up everyone, we're an energetic, sporadic, enthralling, tantalizing, and polite rock band from Philadelphia, PA. If you've ever seen us live, that description probably makes more sense. We're called Nobody Yet, and no, we aren't changing our name to ""Somebody Now"" once we're famous. We've written a bunch of new songs touching on many emotions, and we're ready to put them on record for you and only you. We guarantee this album will be full of more energy than you've ever seen out of us before. Come to a show and we will literally rip your faces off. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We really appreciate all the support over the years, and are asking all of you one more time to help us keep making the music we love to make. While you dream of unicorns and talking dinosaurs, we dream of playing Warped Tour. While you wake up to a fresh cup of Folger's, we wake up in the back of a cold van after cuddling with each other all night. While you try to pick up girls at the mall, we take turns hitting on our merch girl. This is our lives and we're going to do everything that it takes to keep doing this for you forever. Right now we would love for you to help us get there!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: justify;""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000066"">Why We Need the Money</font></h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">For this campaign, we are raising money to help fund the recording of our very first full-length album. We've found a kick-ass engineer who's going to help us make the songs sound awesome. The album won't be cheap, and there are certainly other costs involved in the process. The cost of recording, printing cds, touring expenses, ordering new merchandise, and flying to the moon for inspiration add up quickly, and we could use your help in finishing our first full-length album.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If we are hungry and go out to eat after a show, Joe uses the 
tip money he gets from delivering pizzas (most of the time he just eats the pizza), Ryan uses money he earns hustling at the bowling alley, and Alaapster uses money that he steals from his 
little sister. We do NOT use band money. As with 
every single merch item we've ever sold, every penny that we earn or 
receive from ANYTHING goes directly to our Nobody Yet piggy bank, 
which in turn helps to pay for band expenses such as new t-shirts or gas for our tour van. Currently, with our band account, we are nowhere near being able to afford a new album.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">We don't do this to make money, we just want to be able to play shows every single night. Even if that means eating dry Oodles of Noodles for every meal. Most of the time we don't even get paid at shows. Frankly, we will scrape from
 the streets if we have to, but every dollar you donate is one more dollar we can spend toward advancing Nobody Yet. </div>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000066"">What We Need and What You Get</font></span></p>

</div></div>","We are Nobody Yet
What's up everyone, we're an energetic, sporadic, enthralling, tantalizing, and polite rock band from Philadelphia, PA. If you've ever seen us live, that description probably makes more sense. We're called Nobody Yet, and no, we aren't changing our name to ""Somebody Now"" once we're famous. We've written a bunch of new songs touching on many emotions, and we're ready to put them on record for you and only you. We guarantee this album will be full of more energy than you've ever seen out of us before. Come to a show and we will literally rip your faces off. 

We really appreciate all the support over the years, and are asking all of you one more time to help us keep making the music we love to make. While you dream of unicorns and talking dinosaurs, we dream of playing Warped Tour. While you wake up to a fresh cup of Folger's, we wake up in the back of a cold van after cuddling with each other all night. While you try to pick up girls at the mall, we take turns hitting on our merch girl. This is our lives and we're going to do everything that it takes to keep doing this for you forever. Right now we would love for you to help us get there!


Why We Need the Money
For this campaign, we are raising money to help fund the recording of our very first full-length album. We've found a kick-ass engineer who's going to help us make the songs sound awesome. The album won't be cheap, and there are certainly other costs involved in the process. The cost of recording, printing cds, touring expenses, ordering new merchandise, and flying to the moon for inspiration add up quickly, and we could use your help in finishing our first full-length album.

If we are hungry and go out to eat after a show, Joe uses the 
tip money he gets from delivering pizzas (most of the time he just eats the pizza), Ryan uses money he earns hustling at the bowling alley, and Alaapster uses money that he steals from his 
little sister. We do NOT use band money. As with 
every single merch item we've ever sold, every penny that we earn or 
receive from ANYTHING goes directly to our Nobody Yet piggy bank, 
which in turn helps to pay for band expenses such as new t-shirts or gas for our tour van. Currently, with our band account, we are nowhere near being able to afford a new album.

We don't do this to make money, we just want to be able to play shows every single night. Even if that means eating dry Oodles of Noodles for every meal. Most of the time we don't even get paid at shows. Frankly, we will scrape from
 the streets if we have to, but every dollar you donate is one more dollar we can spend toward advancing Nobody Yet. 

What We Need and What You Get
We are trying to raise $3500, which will cover the bulk of recording and printing costs for the CD. You can expect updates from us along the way as we finish up writing, get into the studio, and prepare to tour the new material. 

Every single donation receives a reward! Plus EVERY SUPPORTER WILL BE THANKED ON OUR ALBUM. That's right, each one of your names will be on the inside of our album!!

We hope that you dig them! Please leave a phone number, email address, or a way for us to contact you and thank you personally for your support. We really do appreciate it. Like really. If there's something that you've always wanted from us but is not listed as a reward (like a song request, a back rub from Joe, or a slumber party with the band) or just have a question about something, please don't hesitate to ask - we will do anything we can to make you happy. Anything.

<p>This is a teaser for the upcoming album and companion DVD from Fancy Trash. This is a condensed version of the new track ""Too Many Dings"". It was recorded at Justin Pizzoferrato's new studio in Easthampton, and the video was produced by Drew Steelman. It was filmed by Bryant Naro, Scott Hancock, Jeff Byrnes, Adam Wilkins, and Jessica Correia. Editing by James Steelman.</p>
<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.fancytrash.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Fancy Trash</strong></a> works the line between rock and folk, blending a non-traditional sensibility with the tradition of acoustic instruments to make something unique: Folk-tinged indie rock. Don’t let the acoustic instruments fool you, Fancy Trash is a rock band.</p>
<p>Dave Houghton (vocals, guitars), Paul Kochanski (upright bass) and Jason Smith (drums) explore new ways to bring out the folk for the anti-folk.</p>
<p>Reviews:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">“It isn’t easy to be Fancy Trash. It’s not supposed to be. The twang-rock band based here has chosen to take on two of rock’s most difficult challenges: performing as a trio and playing energetic, often edgy music on acoustic instruments… Most bands would wisely avoid this combination of hurdles. Fancy Trash embraces it. With its semicountrified, punk-influenced music that recalls Neil Young, Clem Snide, the Flaming Lips, and an assortment of ’90s alternarock bands (from Nirvana to early Radiohead), the group doesn’t simply pull off acoustic trio rock, it makes it seem natural. The band’s live sets drip with energy. Its songs turn on delicate guitar picking and furious strumming.”<br/>- <a href=""http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-7848202.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Boston Globe April 30, 2004 by Sean Glennon</a></p>

Though Garrett played drums and Jacob sang they lacked the other members necessary to form a band as well as the motivation. In 2008, they began playing music casually together with a guitar player friend and their first band, A Decent Tuesday, was born. The group soon added Chris Harvey to play guitar in order to improve their sound. As A Decent Tuesday, Garrett, Jacob and Chris played shows all across the upstate New York area and recorded a self produced EP as well as a full length album entitled Oceanic. However, in late 2010, the band feeling burned out decided to take some time off and they never reunited.</h3>
<h3>Out of this project however, The September Campaign was born. Jacob, Chris and Garrett, missing the experience of playing in a band, began forming a new project with a new set of members. They recruited their friend Sage to play keyboard and Sage Keber then suggested a guitar player he knew named Tony Marinilli, and the foundation of The September Campaign was established. This group along with Stephen Faro on guitar, began playing together in April 2011 in the Rochester, NY area. </h3>
<h3>The band quickly wrote an albums worth of material that they planned on turning into an album in the winter of 2012, but due to recording issues this album never materialized. The band did however release their first single, entitled Gallows, as well as an accompanying music video that received 1,000 views within 24 hours of it being posted online. During this time, the band played shows all across the upstate New York area, earning spots on shows with bands like Emery, Hawthorne Heights, Decoder, and more. 2012 brought some challenges for the band, as long time guitar player, Stephen, decided to leave the band. After several more member changes the lineup eventually solidified with the addition of Conor Mulcahy on bass. This new lineup abandoned nearly all of their older songs, deciding that it was time to start fresh with new material for a new record.</h3>
<h3>These songs, after being written throughout the summer of 2012, ultimately became the material for The September Campaign's debut album entitled ""Haunt."" These new songs feature a somewhat more aggressive and technical sound for the band compared with their earlier songs. They are extremely proud of these new songs that they have written and are now eagerly anticipating the release of ""Haunt"" in early 2013.  </h3>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>GA3 believes we are called to proclaim the Gospel of Christ, to maintain the worship of God through our lives and music, and to inspire in all people a love and passion for righteousness. We've been making music as a group for a long time, but for the past 2 years we have tried to expand our platform and reach more of the world. This year we are excited to announce that our first full length album will debut and it is called Alternative Lifestyle! </p>
<p>This is where YOU come in!  In order to make great music that glorifies the Most High and also competes with what so many of our young people are listening to, it takes money.  We serve an awesome God and we want to make Him known to the world, but He deserves our very best and GA3 wants to bring quality.  Quality in production, sound, packaging, promotion, etc.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>$2,000 is our goal and we are confident that with YOUR help we will reach it.  These funds will go towards the following: <br/>-<strong>Packaging</strong>: in the past we would all sit around and literally burn 100's of CD's and package them ourselves.  Needless to say the result wasn't as nice as something you would buy in the store.  CD duplications and packaging is a must! <br/>-<strong>Promotion</strong>: in order for people to purchase our music, they need to know that it's out there.  Promotion and marketing is very costly, but very necessary. <br/>-<strong>Music Video</strong>: a great way for people to recognize you and grow attached to your music is through videos.  Who doesn't like a good video? And we want the best quality--check out the video we already have: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll3JqjqwJC0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll3JqjqwJC0</a></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Think about your favorite song.  That song can either make you smile, laugh, dance, cry, give you chills or make you simply nod your head. In some way or another music touches us.  It touches us deep down in our souls and it stays there for a while.  They call music ""the universal language"" because it's the only art form that can speak to anybody, anywhere.  Music doesn't care about your race, background or social class; it just wants to be heard. </p>
<p>Here's the problem though.  When you turn on the radio there isn't much worth listening to, but many still do.  Between the 808's, high hat drums and hand claps are profane, misogynistic and violent lyrics.  These lyrics don't make us smile or give us chills, but they should make us cry.  GA3 is here to offer an alternative--Alternative Lifestyle. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>GA3 understands that everyone is not in a position to make donations and we don't want anyone to strain themselves financially for our sake--we appreciate it though!  Listen, if you are not in a position at the moment to make a donation here are a few ways you can help us out: <br/>-<strong>Spread The Word</strong>: tell your family, friends, neighbors and strangers, not just about this campaign but our ministry as a whole. Tell them to check out our website <strong>gideonsarmyga.com</strong> for music, updates and news. We are on a mission to build the kingdom and every penny or dollar will help. <br/>-<strong>Open Your Doors</strong>: if you have a church or any venue don't hesitate to invite us.  We are more than willing to come out if our schedule permits. <br/>-<strong>Pray</strong>: most important thing you could do for us right now is to pray. Pray that God will use us however He chooses and that we will take a backseat to His agenda.  Pray for our strength as we boldly step out on faith. Pray for our humilty as our audience expands and grows.  Most importanly pray that souls will be reached through our music. </p>

This is where YOU come in!  In order to make great music that glorifies the Most High and also competes with what so many of our young people are listening to, it takes money.  We serve an awesome God and we want to make Him known to the world, but He deserves our very best and GA3 wants to bring quality.  Quality in production, sound, packaging, promotion, etc.  


What We Need & What You Get
$2,000 is our goal and we are confident that with YOUR help we will reach it.  These funds will go towards the following: -Packaging: in the past we would all sit around and literally burn 100's of CD's and package them ourselves.  Needless to say the result wasn't as nice as something you would buy in the store.  CD duplications and packaging is a must! -Promotion: in order for people to purchase our music, they need to know that it's out there.  Promotion and marketing is very costly, but very necessary. -Music Video: a great way for people to recognize you and grow attached to your music is through videos.  Who doesn't like a good video? And we want the best quality--check out the video we already have: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll3JqjqwJC0


The Impact
Think about your favorite song.  That song can either make you smile, laugh, dance, cry, give you chills or make you simply nod your head. In some way or another music touches us.  It touches us deep down in our souls and it stays there for a while.  They call music ""the universal language"" because it's the only art form that can speak to anybody, anywhere.  Music doesn't care about your race, background or social class; it just wants to be heard. 
Here's the problem though.  When you turn on the radio there isn't much worth listening to, but many still do.  Between the 808's, high hat drums and hand claps are profane, misogynistic and violent lyrics.  These lyrics don't make us smile or give us chills, but they should make us cry.  GA3 is here to offer an alternative--Alternative Lifestyle. 


Other Ways You Can Help
GA3 understands that everyone is not in a position to make donations and we don't want anyone to strain themselves financially for our sake--we appreciate it though!  Listen, if you are not in a position at the moment to make a donation here are a few ways you can help us out: -Spread The Word: tell your family, friends, neighbors and strangers, not just about this campaign but our ministry as a whole. Tell them to check out our website gideonsarmyga.com for music, updates and news. We are on a mission to build the kingdom and every penny or dollar will help. -Open Your Doors: if you have a church or any venue don't hesitate to invite us.  We are more than willing to come out if our schedule permits. -Pray: most important thing you could do for us right now is to pray. Pray that God will use us however He chooses and that we will take a backseat to His agenda.  Pray for our strength as we boldly step out on faith. Pray for our humilty as our audience expands and grows.  Most importanly pray that souls will be reached through our music.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
Samantha Crain had her guitar stolen out of her car in broad daylight while she was in Columbus Ohio. How pathetic is that?!<br/><br/>The video is from her show here in Salt Lake in 2011.

<p><b>The Louisiana Sessions</b></p>
<p>Hello!  My name is Grant Dermody. I am a harmonica
player, singer, songwriter and tunesmith from Seattle, Washington. I play
acoustic American Roots music. I am raising money to record and manufacture my
third CD, The Louisiana Sessions. We start recording in January 2014 at Dirk
Powell's studio in Breaux Bridge, Louisiana.</p>
<p>I have been a working
musician for over thirty years. I have performed, toured and recorded with some
of the very best. I have been a sideman, a band member and solo artist. My last
two solo records had over 20 guest artists each. Each CD was a testament to and
an attempt to capture the musical relationships I have developed throughout my
life and career. You can read about them on my website <a href=""http://www.grantdermody.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.grantdermody.com</a>.
You can also see my complete discography and biography. </p>
<p>My most recent record,
Lay Down My Burden 2010 was made during the two years my wife, Eileen, was ill
and before her passing. That record was about strength, power, depth of love,
perseverance, and community. It was difficult to do but it emerged as a
beautiful record and one of which I am very proud. </p>
<p>I am ready to make a
new record, with a deeper power, a more joyful strength and a smaller
musical community. With this recording, I'll be doing what I do best, playing
Country Blues, Old-Time and Cajun music with some good friends and fabulous
musicians. I have written a bunch of new tunes for this project and am ready to
get to work laying them down.</p>
<p>I will be joined by
Dirk Powell and Orville Johnson on all the tunes. Cedric Watson will join us on
fiddle for the old-time and cajun tunes, and Rich Del Grosso will play mandolin
on the deep, low-down blues tunes. All are great friends and musicians and are
ready, willing and able to help me make the best possible CD. They are also a
group I can tour with once the record is out. </p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Dirk Powell will be
the engineer for the project and it will be mastered by nine-time Grammy winner
Michael Bishop from 5/4 Productions.</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>I have the vision and
tunes for a great record, and I have the best musicians working with me as
well. I need your help with the financial part to bring it all to life. </p>

<p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">THE
FINANCING</b><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>My last
two recordings were each done over two-year periods, a song or two at a time. A
few hundred dollars a session, spread out this way was affordable. As each CD
had over twenty guest artists, this was also the most reasonable way to
complete the recording. </p>
<p>This
record will be recorded in two 3-4 day sessions; one in January 2014 and one in
March. </p>
<p>Here is
the breakdown of expenses:</p>
<p>Recording,
paying these amazing musicians for their time, effort, and supreme
musicianship- $11,000.00</p>
<p>Mastering-
$1500.00</p>
<p>Graphic

$2500.00</p>

<p>TOTAL-

<p>I am
asking for $15,000.00, less than the total cost of the project. I will cover
the rest of the expenses myself. I need you to become part of this project, to
help me make the best possible recording. </p>
<p>Check
out the perks you will get for contributing. There is a lot there to like.</p>
<p>If I do
not receive all the money I ask for I will use what I get to pay the musicians,
and the recording and mastering engineers. This will leave me to cover the post
production costs myself. I'll figure it out and get it done. I am fully
committed to getting this record out into the world.</p>

<p><b>Not Your Granny’s Dulcimer, a CD and
Video Project by John Sheckler</b></p>
<p>A funny thing happened on my way to
becoming a musical performer…<span>  My music
became a huge hit with children and their parents.</span></p>
<p>When I perform, I always have a bag of
percussion “toys” children can use to join the music. That bag includes musical
spoons, shakers and gourd “crickets” I have made. They also have the
opportunity for a fun sing-a-long on “Pretty Barn” and several other songs I
have written.</p>
<p>Some other songs, like Ground Hog,
allow me to work the names of the children into the lyrics. “Yonder comes Sally
with a ten foot pole, shove that ground hog back in his hole.” </p>
<p>The greatest joy I receive from
performing is when a parent comes back to tell me that their child is always
withdrawn, even autistic, but I was able to break them out of their shell. One
time, I sat next to a blind teenager girl and guided her hand across the
dulcimer fret board and gave her the opportunity to play a simple song. </p>
<p><b>Hello,
my name is John Sheckler</b>, and when I retired from a career in
journalism, life gave me more time to devote to my second artistic love, music.</p>
<p>The mountain dulcimer is my primary
instrument, and I write many of my songs. My music transcends the traditional
music style that is usually associated with the dulcimer, so my performances
and first CD are called “<b>Not Your
Granny’s Dulcimer</b>.”<span>  </span></p>
<p>Many times when I perform or write
songs, I feel it is not me playing the music, but rather, it is the music
playing me. That music has pulled me in a very specific direction. It is a
joyful experience, and I feel blessed to be able to share that experience with
other people.</p>
<p>My performances
are in the interactive style of street musicians and always include a few
surprises. My audience will hear mountain standards like “Old Joe Clark” or
“Little Liza Jane,” but then I try to take the music to unexpected places. One
of my songs is a happy song about wind chimes written to the music of the Pachelbel
Canon in D.</p>
<p>I will stop to
tell tales about the origin of the instrument and music, and even take time to give
an impromptu lesson to an audience member.</p>
<p>My goal for
this project is to create a video and CD of Children’s songs that I can use as
a musical resume’ to approach schools and community service organizations. I
want to take my performances into the class rooms and more festivals so that I
can reach the widest possible audience.</p>
<p>A Facebook
quote from a friend sums up what I try to accomplish<i>:”</i><i>What a gift you are John. Not only are you good with bringing the music
out of children, you also have the gift to bring the inner child out of the
adults.”</i> <b><i>Gigi Straub</i></b></p>
<p><b>Where
the Money Goes</b></p>
<p>My budget has
no frills. It includes only the basic production and printing costs necessary
to create and print CDs and a video that I will use to promote my performances.
If I receive donations in excess of my goal, the extra money will go directly
into printing a larger number of CDs, or more video.</p>
<p>The
largest single cost is for the printing of the CDs through Disc Makers
Manufacturing. I have selected the lowest cost packing option. No expensive
plastic cases, just a simple earth friendly cardboard disc case.</p>
<p>Print 1,000 CDs, (includes set up costs)<span> 
$1,050, </span></p><p>Recording production costs<span>  $100</span></p>
<p>Video costs<span>    $200</span></p>
<p>Transportation and other <span>  $100</span></p>
<p>Estimated Indiegogo fee<span>  $125</span></p>
<p><b>TOTAL<span>    $1,575</span></b></p>
<p><b>How
You Can Help:</b></p>
<p>Spread
the word!  Raising funds to meet the budget is one vital and tangible way
you can help. But there are other ways, too. As you pass the word on to your
network of friends and family, you're reaching people and places I could never
reach alone.</p>

     some noise about this campaign.  Introduce music fans to me and tell them about the CD and my
     performances.</span></li>
</ul><p>
</p><p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<ul>
<li>In these days of
     standardized testing, many schools are no longer able to have music
     programs. Local folk culture has also fallen by the wayside. <b>My ultimate
     goal with this project is to have marketing material that will allow me to
     approach schools and libraries seeking visiting performers to offset that
     loss of arts education.</b>
</li>
<li>My music is already
     a regular part of several folk music and community art festivals, so I
     have celebrated a degree of success. If I can widen that base, it
     will allow me to share the joy of music with a wider audience.</li>
</ul><p><b>What
people are saying about Not Your Granny’s Dulcimer</b></p>
<p>“John Sheckler is one of the
most enthusiastic performers and music lovers I’ve ever known. His energy is
vital to the RiverRoots Music and Folk Arts Festival and he manages the Folk
Jammers tent with grace, making all comers feel welcome to participate. </p>
<p>As a performer his main
instrument, the lap dulcimer, is transformed from a traditional folk and “old time” musical instrument to a creative and innovative
piece of musical expression. He fearlessly explores a multitude of genres,
playing them all with passion on an instrument most people pigeon-hole in a
very “past” context.”</p>
<p><b><i>Greg Ziesemer, RiverRoots Music
and Folk Arts Festival Director</i></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><br/></p><p>“John Sheckler is a fun
guy!<span>  He never met a stranger or a song
he didn't like. His unassuming personal charm flies into his music.  It is always an enjoyable time with him!”</span></p>
<p><b><i>Steve Thomas, Thomas Family
Winery</i></b></p>
<br/><p>“John Sheckler's
passion for the dulcimer and his ability to play an array of styles of
music has provided an enlightening experience for our patrons. He
focuses a lot on crowd interaction and participation, which adds to the
enjoyment of all.  He will continue to be a part of
the diversity in the musical talent we provide.”  </p>
<p align=""left""><b><i>Teresa
Weyler, Little Kentucky River Winery</i></b></p>
<br/><p>“John Sheckler is a
delight to work with and brings a fabulous interactive performance for our
attendees at New Albany IndieFest.  Parents and children alike gather to
listen to original songs as well as old classics.  It is wonderful to see
how fascinated the children are with the multitude of instruments that John
brings and to see them learn and explore the music.  We look forward to
inviting John and his dulcimer back to the IndieFest for many years to
come.""</p>
<p align=""left""><b><i>Cisa Barry, New
Albany First</i></b></p>
<p><br/></p><p>We have many things to offer for people who attend the
Ferdinand Folk Festival. One of our main attractions--and the only one to recur
each of the four years we've held our growing music fest--is the Folk Jammers'
area where musicians, from beginning to highly skilled, are encouraged to bring
their own instruments and jam over the course of the day.</p>
<p>John Sheckler's great leadership in leading this event year
after year is, no doubt, the key to the event. He has a passion for all types
of music and, perhaps most importantly, allowing all skill levels to play. His
skill at, to be certain, mastering of the lap dulcimer is key to this success.
He is a musician's musician and I have no doubt that his skill at leading the
Folk Jammers is surpassed only by his skill at performing as a solo artist. </p>
<p>We have continued and will always extend a welcome in
Ferdinand to John Sheckler and count him as a friend to Ferdinand and our
rising cultural scene. </p>

surprises. My audience will hear mountain standards like “Old Joe Clark” or
“Little Liza Jane,” but then I try to take the music to unexpected places. One
of my songs is a happy song about wind chimes written to the music of the Pachelbel
Canon in D.
I will stop to
tell tales about the origin of the instrument and music, and even take time to give
an impromptu lesson to an audience member.
My goal for
this project is to create a video and CD of Children’s songs that I can use as
a musical resume’ to approach schools and community service organizations. I
want to take my performances into the class rooms and more festivals so that I
can reach the widest possible audience.
A Facebook
quote from a friend sums up what I try to accomplish:”What a gift you are John. Not only are you good with bringing the music
out of children, you also have the gift to bring the inner child out of the
adults.” Gigi Straub
Where
the Money Goes
My budget has
no frills. It includes only the basic production and printing costs necessary
to create and print CDs and a video that I will use to promote my performances.
If I receive donations in excess of my goal, the extra money will go directly
into printing a larger number of CDs, or more video.
The
largest single cost is for the printing of the CDs through Disc Makers
Manufacturing. I have selected the lowest cost packing option. No expensive
plastic cases, just a simple earth friendly cardboard disc case.
Print 1,000 CDs, (includes set up costs) 
$1,050, Recording production costs  $100
Video costs    $200
Transportation and other   $100
Estimated Indiegogo fee  $125
TOTAL    $1,575
How
You Can Help:
Spread
the word!  Raising funds to meet the budget is one vital and tangible way
you can help. But there are other ways, too. As you pass the word on to your
network of friends and family, you're reaching people and places I could never
reach alone.

The Impact

In these days of
     standardized testing, many schools are no longer able to have music
     programs. Local folk culture has also fallen by the wayside. My ultimate
     goal with this project is to have marketing material that will allow me to
     approach schools and libraries seeking visiting performers to offset that
     loss of arts education.

My music is already
     a regular part of several folk music and community art festivals, so I
     have celebrated a degree of success. If I can widen that base, it
     will allow me to share the joy of music with a wider audience.
What
people are saying about Not Your Granny’s Dulcimer
“John Sheckler is one of the
most enthusiastic performers and music lovers I’ve ever known. His energy is
vital to the RiverRoots Music and Folk Arts Festival and he manages the Folk
Jammers tent with grace, making all comers feel welcome to participate. 
As a performer his main
instrument, the lap dulcimer, is transformed from a traditional folk and “old time” musical instrument to a creative and innovative
piece of musical expression. He fearlessly explores a multitude of genres,
playing them all with passion on an instrument most people pigeon-hole in a
very “past” context.”
Greg Ziesemer, RiverRoots Music
and Folk Arts Festival Director

“John Sheckler is a fun
guy!  He never met a stranger or a song
he didn't like. His unassuming personal charm flies into his music.  It is always an enjoyable time with him!”
Steve Thomas, Thomas Family
Winery
“John Sheckler's
passion for the dulcimer and his ability to play an array of styles of
music has provided an enlightening experience for our patrons. He
focuses a lot on crowd interaction and participation, which adds to the
enjoyment of all.  He will continue to be a part of
the diversity in the musical talent we provide.”  
Teresa
Weyler, Little Kentucky River Winery
“John Sheckler is a
delight to work with and brings a fabulous interactive performance for our
attendees at New Albany IndieFest.  Parents and children alike gather to
listen to original songs as well as old classics.  It is wonderful to see
how fascinated the children are with the multitude of instruments that John
brings and to see them learn and explore the music.  We look forward to
inviting John and his dulcimer back to the IndieFest for many years to
come.""
Cisa Barry, New
Albany First
We have many things to offer for people who attend the
Ferdinand Folk Festival. One of our main attractions--and the only one to recur
each of the four years we've held our growing music fest--is the Folk Jammers'
area where musicians, from beginning to highly skilled, are encouraged to bring
their own instruments and jam over the course of the day.
John Sheckler's great leadership in leading this event year
after year is, no doubt, the key to the event. He has a passion for all types
of music and, perhaps most importantly, allowing all skill levels to play. His
skill at, to be certain, mastering of the lap dulcimer is key to this success.
He is a musician's musician and I have no doubt that his skill at leading the
Folk Jammers is surpassed only by his skill at performing as a solo artist. 
We have continued and will always extend a welcome in
Ferdinand to John Sheckler and count him as a friend to Ferdinand and our
rising cultural scene. 
Marc Steczyk,
Ferdinand Folk Festival Director

I have been taking my own passion for the good rock-blues music around the world for thirty years now - a daily challenge that has been rewarded by the pleasure and the enthusiasm of those who got to know me in the street, on the major festival stages, in the sweaty, smoky corners of the small clubs I played in. 
Today, 26 years from the release of my first demo tape as a trio, I decided to make a dream come true. I will be leaving for the land where my music was born, recruit a couple of musicians I will get acquainted with over time and record with them may be in a rented secluded farmhouse all the original material I need for my new album. 
Even though my own little recording studio is perfectly equipped to make CDs and I know many a musician who could help me with that, the challenge is now going for the adventure - no comfy hotels, no elegant recording studios - just new persons to meet and share musical ideas with.

</p><p>English version after the french one.<br/></p><p>-------------------------------------<br/></p><p>Bonjour à tous.<br/></p>
<p>Je me présente, je m'appelle Jonathan
      Bouchard et je suis un Canadien de 38 ans. Pour tout savoir de ma
      vie
      et de mes réalisations, consulter mon site personnel,
      JonathanBouchard.ca</p>
<p>Je suis le fondateur du projet
      TacticalFM, né le premier janvier 2007. Le but du projet est
      simple, s'informer en dénonçant la désinformation.</p>
<p>Ceci paraît simple... mais par où
      commence-t-on quand on veut s'informer? Votre premier réflexe sera
      de consulter votre site de nouvelles préféré, un site disons X.
      Vous découvrirez un peu plus tard, un autre site, Y celui-là, et
      ainsi de suite. Par contre, il est humainement impossible de
      parcourir l'alphabet des sites d'information et ce chaque jour,
      en
      plus du travail, du temps familial, etc...</p>
<p>C'est ici que TacticalFM entre en
      action. </p>
<p>D'accord, il y a les engins de
      recherche et leur section “Actualités” mais vous aurez encore
      une liste bâtie par un robot (programme informatique) et vous
      verrez
      que la séparation entre nouvelle officielle et blog se dissipe
      avec
      le temps dans les résultats de recherche..</p>
<p>Vraiment, LA solution pour avoir le
      meilleur de l'actualité mondiale, c'est la page d'accueil de
      TacticalFM.com</p>
<p>Notre centre de surveillance de
      l'actualité est né en 2011. Il s'agit simplement d'une banque de
      liens d'actualité; c'est l'endroit où ceux inscrits au jeu des
      Chevaliers de l'information rapportent ce qu'ils ont chassés.</p>
<p>Sans aller dans le détail du jeu, le
      moteur de TacticalFM, ce qui est capable de bâtir cette liste de
      nouvelles mondiales, est en fait un puissant système
      d'auto-apprentissage de l'information par le jeu. On gagne des
      points d'expérience en s'intéressant à l'actualité mondiale pour
      ultimement animer dans l'émission talk radio en direct des
      Chevaliers de l'information.</p>
<p>Il est carrément impossible
      d'expliquer l'entièreté du projet rapidement, le mieux c'est d'y
      faire un tour, tacticalfm.com.</p>
<p>Donc voilà, le but sur TacticalFM.com
      est de s'informer entre amis.</p>
<p>S'informer, mais pas n'importe
      comment... je parle ici évidemment de financement, le nerf de la
      guerre. TacticalFM n'est pas une entreprise et ne reçoit aucune
      subvention du gouvernement.. Il n'y a pas de publicité sur
      TacticalFM.com et ce pour une raison: nous croyons que les
      concepts
      d'information et consommation ne doivent pas se mélanger et qu'il
      vaut mieux éviter la naissance même de quelconque conflit
      d'intérêt, en supprimant à la source cette possibilité.</p>
<p>De la publicité sur TacticalFM, mise à
      part celle locale de promotion du site et des émissions, il n'y en
      a
      pas. Vous n'êtes pas sur TacticalFM pour acheter quelque chose et
      nous en sommes conscients, vous voulez vous informer, point.</p>
<p>Tenir mordicus au principe de ne pas
      mélanger publicité et information nuit donc à notre financement...
      bien malgré nous. À ce moment, la solution IndieGogo est donc
      l'idéale pour le projet TacticalFM.</p>
<p>Avec vous et le principe de
      CrowdFunding, le projet prendra une expansion magnifique: des
      bureaux
      officiels, des salaires pour ceux qui y travaillent à temps
      plein.... Une vision que j'ai depuis bien des années et qui va
      maintenant prendre forme grâce à vous, j'en suis certain.</p>
<p>Pour bien faire les choses, il faut
      prendre son temps. Maintenant que nous avons un système fiable et
      une base de données bien remplie, nous désirons passer à une
      vitesse supérieure pour le projet pour 2015.</p>
<p>Pour l'instant, nous n'avons pas de
      bureau, c'est connu que je fais tout avec mon matériel
      personnel
      dans un studio qui n'en est pas un, chez moi.</p>
<p>Maintenant, la situation est
      critique... Après 7 ans de travail acharné, malgré les quelques
      dons réguliers que je reçois et la régularité du salaire familial
      au total, le coût de la vie a trop augmenté et je ne peux plus
      suivre. Croyez-moi, j'ai une modeste vie, je n'abuse de rien,
      j'achète local... nous essayons du mieux que nous pouvons. </p>
<p>Le premier projet que je propose sur
      IndieGogo servira à démontrer que l'information pour vous, c'est
      important. Quand je parle d'information, je ne parle pas des
      nouvelles du showbizz ou du sport, mais des vraies nouvelles
      mondiales qui changent nos vies.</p>
<p>Le problème est que si la tendance se
      maintient, je ne serai plus en mesure d'être à temps plein (et
      bien
      plus) sur le projet.</p>
<p>Nous avions planifié de faire ce vidéo
      beaucoup plus tard, en 2015, mais il a fallu nous rendre à
      l'évidence, la situation de plusieurs d'entre nous est critique.
      Nous devons donner un grand coup afin que le projet s'épanouisse
      vraiment comme il se doit au lieu de le voir se ralentir dans un
      perpétuel futur incertain... l'information ça n'attend pas!</p>
<p>Cette pré-campagne 2015 a pour but de
      me fournir une sécurité personnelle afin que je puisse librement
      et
      à temps plein assurer l'avenir de TacticalFM.com et de mes
      Chevaliers de l'information. Cette campagne de financement très
      importante servira de tremplin pour 2015.</p>
<p>La vie coûte très cher, j'en suis
      conscient c'est pourquoi je vous remercie d'avance de votre
      contribution... c'est un cri du coeur que je lance pour qu'enfin
      le
      projet TacticalFM prenne l'envol qu'ìl mérite.</p>
<p>Merci à tous et merci de votre visite
      sur TacticalFM.com</p>

<p>Peace</p><p>-------------------------------------</p><p>Hello to all.<br/></p><p><br/>I
introduce myself, my name is Jonathan Bouchard 38 and I am a
Canadian. To know everything about my life and my work, please visit
my personal website, JonathanBouchard.ca<br/><br/>I am the founder of
the TacticalFM, created January first 2007. The purpose of the
project is simple, world news and misinformation denounciation.<br/><br/>This
seems simple... but where do you start when you you do not want to
miss any world news? Your first instinct will be to visit your
favorite news site, a site “X”. You will discover a little later,
another site “Y”, and so on. By cons, it is humanly impossible to
navigate the all news websites and this, every day, in addition to
work, family time, etc.<br/><br/>It is here where TacticalFM step right
into action.<br/><br/>Of course, there are search engines and their
""News"" section, but you'll still have a list built by a
robot (computer program) and you'll see that the separation between
official news blogs dissipates over time in the search
results.<br/><br/>Really, the solution to get all the important world
events, it's the home page of TacticalFM.com<br/><br/>Our monitoring
center was born in 2011 and is simply a database of world news links;
This is where those enrolled in the Knights of news game drop what
they hunted, the news.<br/><br/>Without going into the details of the
KoN game engine of TacticalFM, which builds the list of world news,
is actually a powerful world news self-learning system. We earn
experience points and level up and ultimately become a radio host in
our live talk radio broadcast, the Knights of news.<br/><br/>It is
simply impossible to quickly explain the entire project, the best you
can do is visit us on tacticalfm.com.<br/><br/>Basically,
TacticalFM.com goal is to develop our taste for world news.<br/><br/>Informed
yes, but not at all cost.  I'm talking about funding, the nerve of
war. TacticalFM is not a business and receives no government funding.
There is no advertising on TacticalFM.com and for one reason: We

<p></p></div>","English version after the french one.-------------------------------------Bonjour à tous.
Je me présente, je m'appelle Jonathan
      Bouchard et je suis un Canadien de 38 ans. Pour tout savoir de ma
      vie
      et de mes réalisations, consulter mon site personnel,
      JonathanBouchard.ca
Je suis le fondateur du projet
      TacticalFM, né le premier janvier 2007. Le but du projet est
      simple, s'informer en dénonçant la désinformation.
Ceci paraît simple... mais par où
      commence-t-on quand on veut s'informer? Votre premier réflexe sera
      de consulter votre site de nouvelles préféré, un site disons X.
      Vous découvrirez un peu plus tard, un autre site, Y celui-là, et
      ainsi de suite. Par contre, il est humainement impossible de
      parcourir l'alphabet des sites d'information et ce chaque jour,
      en
      plus du travail, du temps familial, etc...
C'est ici que TacticalFM entre en
      action. 
D'accord, il y a les engins de
      recherche et leur section “Actualités” mais vous aurez encore
      une liste bâtie par un robot (programme informatique) et vous
      verrez
      que la séparation entre nouvelle officielle et blog se dissipe
      avec
      le temps dans les résultats de recherche..
Vraiment, LA solution pour avoir le
      meilleur de l'actualité mondiale, c'est la page d'accueil de
      TacticalFM.com
Notre centre de surveillance de
      l'actualité est né en 2011. Il s'agit simplement d'une banque de
      liens d'actualité; c'est l'endroit où ceux inscrits au jeu des
      Chevaliers de l'information rapportent ce qu'ils ont chassés.
Sans aller dans le détail du jeu, le
      moteur de TacticalFM, ce qui est capable de bâtir cette liste de
      nouvelles mondiales, est en fait un puissant système
      d'auto-apprentissage de l'information par le jeu. On gagne des
      points d'expérience en s'intéressant à l'actualité mondiale pour
      ultimement animer dans l'émission talk radio en direct des
      Chevaliers de l'information.
Il est carrément impossible
      d'expliquer l'entièreté du projet rapidement, le mieux c'est d'y
      faire un tour, tacticalfm.com.
Donc voilà, le but sur TacticalFM.com
      est de s'informer entre amis.
S'informer, mais pas n'importe
      comment... je parle ici évidemment de financement, le nerf de la
      guerre. TacticalFM n'est pas une entreprise et ne reçoit aucune
      subvention du gouvernement.. Il n'y a pas de publicité sur
      TacticalFM.com et ce pour une raison: nous croyons que les
      concepts
      d'information et consommation ne doivent pas se mélanger et qu'il
      vaut mieux éviter la naissance même de quelconque conflit
      d'intérêt, en supprimant à la source cette possibilité.
De la publicité sur TacticalFM, mise à
      part celle locale de promotion du site et des émissions, il n'y en
      a
      pas. Vous n'êtes pas sur TacticalFM pour acheter quelque chose et
      nous en sommes conscients, vous voulez vous informer, point.
Tenir mordicus au principe de ne pas
      mélanger publicité et information nuit donc à notre financement...
      bien malgré nous. À ce moment, la solution IndieGogo est donc
      l'idéale pour le projet TacticalFM.
Avec vous et le principe de
      CrowdFunding, le projet prendra une expansion magnifique: des
      bureaux
      officiels, des salaires pour ceux qui y travaillent à temps
      plein.... Une vision que j'ai depuis bien des années et qui va
      maintenant prendre forme grâce à vous, j'en suis certain.
Pour bien faire les choses, il faut
      prendre son temps. Maintenant que nous avons un système fiable et
      une base de données bien remplie, nous désirons passer à une
      vitesse supérieure pour le projet pour 2015.
Pour l'instant, nous n'avons pas de
      bureau, c'est connu que je fais tout avec mon matériel
      personnel
      dans un studio qui n'en est pas un, chez moi.
Maintenant, la situation est
      critique... Après 7 ans de travail acharné, malgré les quelques
      dons réguliers que je reçois et la régularité du salaire familial
      au total, le coût de la vie a trop augmenté et je ne peux plus
      suivre. Croyez-moi, j'ai une modeste vie, je n'abuse de rien,
      j'achète local... nous essayons du mieux que nous pouvons. 
Le premier projet que je propose sur
      IndieGogo servira à démontrer que l'information pour vous, c'est
      important. Quand je parle d'information, je ne parle pas des
      nouvelles du showbizz ou du sport, mais des vraies nouvelles
      mondiales qui changent nos vies.
Le problème est que si la tendance se
      maintient, je ne serai plus en mesure d'être à temps plein (et
      bien
      plus) sur le projet.
Nous avions planifié de faire ce vidéo
      beaucoup plus tard, en 2015, mais il a fallu nous rendre à
      l'évidence, la situation de plusieurs d'entre nous est critique.
      Nous devons donner un grand coup afin que le projet s'épanouisse
      vraiment comme il se doit au lieu de le voir se ralentir dans un
      perpétuel futur incertain... l'information ça n'attend pas!
Cette pré-campagne 2015 a pour but de
      me fournir une sécurité personnelle afin que je puisse librement
      et
      à temps plein assurer l'avenir de TacticalFM.com et de mes
      Chevaliers de l'information. Cette campagne de financement très
      importante servira de tremplin pour 2015.
La vie coûte très cher, j'en suis
      conscient c'est pourquoi je vous remercie d'avance de votre
      contribution... c'est un cri du coeur que je lance pour qu'enfin
      le
      projet TacticalFM prenne l'envol qu'ìl mérite.
Merci à tous et merci de votre visite
      sur TacticalFM.com
Jonathan Bouchard
Peace-------------------------------------Hello to all.I
introduce myself, my name is Jonathan Bouchard 38 and I am a
Canadian. To know everything about my life and my work, please visit
my personal website, JonathanBouchard.caI am the founder of
the TacticalFM, created January first 2007. The purpose of the
project is simple, world news and misinformation denounciation.This
seems simple... but where do you start when you you do not want to
miss any world news? Your first instinct will be to visit your
favorite news site, a site “X”. You will discover a little later,
another site “Y”, and so on. By cons, it is humanly impossible to
navigate the all news websites and this, every day, in addition to
work, family time, etc.It is here where TacticalFM step right
into action.Of course, there are search engines and their
""News"" section, but you'll still have a list built by a
robot (computer program) and you'll see that the separation between
official news blogs dissipates over time in the search
results.Really, the solution to get all the important world
events, it's the home page of TacticalFM.comOur monitoring
center was born in 2011 and is simply a database of world news links;
This is where those enrolled in the Knights of news game drop what
they hunted, the news.Without going into the details of the
KoN game engine of TacticalFM, which builds the list of world news,
is actually a powerful world news self-learning system. We earn
experience points and level up and ultimately become a radio host in
our live talk radio broadcast, the Knights of news.It is
simply impossible to quickly explain the entire project, the best you
can do is visit us on tacticalfm.com.Basically,
TacticalFM.com goal is to develop our taste for world news.Informed
yes, but not at all cost.  I'm talking about funding, the nerve of
war. TacticalFM is not a business and receives no government funding.
There is no advertising on TacticalFM.com and for one reason: We
believe the information (news) and consumption concepts should not
mix and it is better to avoid the very birth of any conflict of
interest by removing at the source that possibility.There is
no advertising on TacticalFM.com, except our own promotion. You're
not on TacticalFM to buy something and we are aware of that, you want
to be informed, period.We hold tight to the principle of not
mixing advertising and information, but this makes things harder. At
this time, the IndieGoGo solution is ideal for the TacticalFM
project.With you and the principle of crowdfunding, the
project will make a wonderful expansion: offices, wages for those who
work full time .... A vision I have for many years and that will now
take shape through to you, I'm sure.It takes time to realize
a project like this. Now that we have a reliable system and a
generous news database, in 2015 we want to go to a higher speed with
the project.For the moment, we have no office, it is known
that I do everything with my own equipment in a pseudo-studio, at my
home.Now the situation is critical ... After 7 years of hard
work, despite some regular donations that I receive and the
regularity of the total family income, the cost of living has
increased too much and I can not keep up. Believe me, I have a modest
life, I spend wisely, I buy local the most I can... we try as best we
can.The first project I propose on IndieGoGo will demonstrate
that information is important for you . When I say information, I'm
not talking about show business  news and sports, but real world news
that change our lives.The problem is that if the trend
continues, I will not be able to be full-time (and more) on the
project anymore.We had planned to make this video much later,
in 2015, but we had to face the facts, the situation of many of us is
critical. We must give a big boost to the project so it really
flourish as it should instead of slowing down in a perpetual
uncertain future... worls news can not wait!This pre-campaign
2015 is to provide personal security for me so that I can freely and
fully secure the future for me and my Knights. This very important
crowdfunding campaign will serve as a springboard for 2015.Life
is very expensive, I am aware and that is why I thank you in advance
for your input ... it is a scream from the heart to finally take the
TacticalFM project where it really belongs, available and known by
everyone.Thank you all for visiting TacticalFM.comJonathan

</h3>
<p>  During my ministry travels I have met many people, seen amazing things, and grown so much closer to God.  He has blessed me abundantly and I am just beginning to see the fruits of these blessings.  One of these fruits has been a burst of inspiration in my songwriting.  Since the day I released my first album, I have been working tirelessly to write more material for album number two.  After two years, I'm ready to get to the studio!  This is where my Indiegogo campaign comes into play.  Studio time with a quality producer is expensive these days.   Not only does the artist have to pay for use of studio space, but other expenses include airfare, music gear, lodging, and food.  These are the essentials, and I need YOUR help to make this project happen!</p>
<p>  By contributing to my fundraising efforts, you are able to help me minister to today's youth.  I work hard to provide quality music to the young church.  I believe that through good music, Christ's message of love can reach the most hardened of hearts.  Your contribution gives me the means to reach the ears of young men and women across America, giving them hope in something greater than themselves.</p>
</div><div>
<p>  <span style="""">Let me break it down...to record an album you need about 12 songs.  Recording and producing ONE song in a quality studio costs about $1200.  So $1200 times 12 songs comes out to about $12,400.  Add travel and equipment expenses on top of that...the costs really add up!  Even if I don't reach my $10,000 goal, every single penny counts!  Every cent raised from this campaign will go towards the production of my next album, be it $20 or $20, 000, I can't do this on my own!</span></p>
<p><span style="""">  Here's something else to consider...the amount of time that goes into producing a new album is surprising to many.  Months are spent on recording, mixing, producing, mastering, and making the album a true work of art.  With so much time dedicated to the studio, there isn't much time to go out and generate a second source of income.  Music is my full time job and every day involves me working overtime. The financial rewards that come from a new album do not appear until long after the album is released, and even then, the income is generally used to pay off past studio expenses.  By contributing to my Indiegogo campaign, you not only help ease the burden of a hefty financial load, but you secure my peace of mind when the album finally releases.</span></p>
</div><div> <p>   Finally, I understand that some people may not have the means to make a financial contribution.  That is okay!  There's other ways to help me achieve my goal!  First and foremost, please pray for me.  All things are possible through God.  Pray for the people I minister to and pray for the people I work with.  Secondly, please tell all your friends and family about my campaign!  I can only reach so many people...your word of mouth is much appreciated!  Lastly, please go view my social media accounts and encourage your friends and family to do the same!  I'm on Instagram and Facebook and love to keep my contributors updated!</p>

<p>Every little bit helps.

54 Days. 

520 individual contributions of $27 or more to fund The Artist, The Image and The INITIATIVE.

An academic year of exploration, discovery and artistic collaboration amongst artists and educators across four continents awaits your support.




Afro(–) is a concept designed to unify musicians, artists and academics: the diasporic movement and cultural development of the African race across North America, South America, Europe, and anywhere else we are.

Pronounced ""AfroDASH,"" the proposed movement serves as a point of reference, a point of inspiration, and a point of CULTURAL INTERCHANGE for musicians and interdisciplinary artists. This long-term collaborative music and performing arts documentation and creation project embodies the spirit of the root that binds us all, removed or un-removed, to the original source of our musical and cultural identities in Africa—both as Afro- people and as non-Afro people that identify with our cultures.


Over the course of two years, Project Afro(–) aims to:
Foster a conscious intellectual and artistic exchange amongst people of mixed African descent by creating a platform for the discussion of racial identity based on social circumstances, foreign immigration and mixed-racial influence. Through the building of this collective, we are building a system of teachers and performers  in various languages, musical styles and ethnic backgrounds with whom our community will collaborate. These interactions in the form of classes, discussions, and workshops will be continuously documented using video journals, photo albums, writings and demonstrative concerts. The project proposes to publish a dedicated website and mixtape that depicts this journey of revival, creation and cultural exchange.

Collect and publish these documents in digital format in both independently and partnership with one or more academic institutions in our countries in order to serve as a teaching tool for studies in humanities, liberal arts and the performing arts.


Finally, develop a diverse performing ensemble of the same name—AfroDASH—of talented performers based out of the culturally-rich center of Madrid, Spain dedicated to the revival, preservation, fusion and, most importantly, the production of these impactful video documents, concerts, community discussions and field recordings both within Madrid and in as many of our home countries to which we can fund travel. Through the teaching and sharing our languages, cultures, and musical traditions, we aim to foster understanding, expand knowledge and inspire social advancement amongst ourselves, our communities and audiences in our native countries.

Being able to open up to people is something that has never come easy to me, and so that is exactly what I set out for this album to do. I challenged myself to be honest and vulnerable and to make a piece of work that would show my development as both a songwriter and a person. John Mark Nelson is producing this album, and I could not be happier to have him alongside me throughout this process. The songs are already coming to life and sounding much better than I could have ever imagined!</div>

<p>It's been roughly four and half years since the release of my last record, Music Man, which is the longest time span between my CDs since my first solo recording released in 2000.  I don't blame that on anything… it simply has to do with the move I made from Austin to the country side of West Texas back in 2009 where I had decided to focus on the goal of building our house. We've now reached a good stopping point where we are already able to live in it. So now is the opening i've been waiting for to make this record.  </p>
<p>I've got a load of new songs (and some old) and I can't wait to put them down and share them with you. Any generosities you should decide to donate would all be spent solely on studio time, i.e. recording, mixing, mastering, as well as compensation for accompanying studio musicians. That's the primary goal - anything on top of that will be used for the promotion of the CD, and anything left beyond that will be used towards the manufacturing of CD's.</p><p>The above video for my new song <i>Out of Sight </i>includes a raw, acoustic version of the song that my wife anna Oakley and i shot near terlingua texas. A fully orchestrated version will be on the new CD.</p>

Be globally responsible.
  With your help we can help others with our contributions from CD sales.
Our song ""Shine A Light"" from our new and upcoming CD and the song ""People are People"" from our ""Pockets"" CD  will have a direct impact on the school kids that sing these songs and learn these positive and inspiring lyrics!  It is our hope that kids everywhere will have an opportunity to share the song.   Our needs (push the little engine up the hill)


We have worked very hard to complete a fantastic collection of 12 kids songsranging from inspiring to silly to downright important lessons about self love!
 All the funds received will be put towards the manufacturing costs of the CD packaging & production costs.

My name is Nate Dal Cais and I have been playing music for most of my life. </p><p>Along the way, I learned the business of music.I have always enjoyed networking with other musicians, which is how I joined forces with my partner, Charles Cudd. </p>
<p>I have been studying how to do publicity,bookings,advertising,design 
and video. We are always willing to share our knowledge with other 
passionate artists. </p>
<p>The video above will explain this further. Seeking funding we need to operate properly as a business, and helping other artists along the way. Contributors can receive consultations from us, as well as help receiving press,and filming for their live shows.<br/> </p><p><b>Our Goal:

</b></p><h3>
<ul>
<li>The funding goal is a bare minimum needed to have cds pressed professionally for both bands: <b>Imbolg</b> &amp; <b>Of Beauty and Madness (or OBAM for short)</b>
 actual replicated cds are a must so we can get our cds distributed to 
stores around the country and receive radio play. If we go well over our
 goal we can have our artists played on the radio, hire a professional management firm, pay
 for a line of merchandise, tour the country and possibly sign other 
bands to the FAR Label.</li>
<li>As a thank you for helping us reach our goal, we will give you free 
music, merchandise(such as shirts,and keychains which are all custom made,no two are alike) a thank you letter and in some cases a personal 
concert for you and your friends! ( Even Bar Mitzvahs! Oy Vey!! )</li>
<li>Also, we offer our expert advice and possible networking 
opportunities to other artists that contribute to our campaign. As well 
as help them understand more about the music business, getting 
publicity, and filming your next live show(see donations and perks for 
more details)</li>
</ul>

After years of learning the business of music, and building up contacts 
we have successfully received some airplay, reviews in magazines and 
performed around the Northeast. This funding will help us continue to do
 this for a lifetime on a national and worldwide level.<br/>
If you can't donate even a small amount, you can still help us by
 reposting on social media and by telling your friends about our artists
 and campaign.

My name is Nate Dal Cais and I have been playing music for most of my life. Along the way, I learned the business of music.I have always enjoyed networking with other musicians, which is how I joined forces with my partner, Charles Cudd. 
I have been studying how to do publicity,bookings,advertising,design 
and video. We are always willing to share our knowledge with other 
passionate artists. 
The video above will explain this further. Seeking funding we need to operate properly as a business, and helping other artists along the way. Contributors can receive consultations from us, as well as help receiving press,and filming for their live shows. Our Goal:



The funding goal is a bare minimum needed to have cds pressed professionally for both bands: Imbolg & Of Beauty and Madness (or OBAM for short)
 actual replicated cds are a must so we can get our cds distributed to 
stores around the country and receive radio play. If we go well over our
 goal we can have our artists played on the radio, hire a professional management firm, pay
 for a line of merchandise, tour the country and possibly sign other 
bands to the FAR Label.
As a thank you for helping us reach our goal, we will give you free 
music, merchandise(such as shirts,and keychains which are all custom made,no two are alike) a thank you letter and in some cases a personal 
concert for you and your friends! ( Even Bar Mitzvahs! Oy Vey!! )
Also, we offer our expert advice and possible networking 
opportunities to other artists that contribute to our campaign. As well 
as help them understand more about the music business, getting 
publicity, and filming your next live show(see donations and perks for 
more details)


After years of learning the business of music, and building up contacts 
we have successfully received some airplay, reviews in magazines and 
performed around the Northeast. This funding will help us continue to do
 this for a lifetime on a national and worldwide level.
If you can't donate even a small amount, you can still help us by
 reposting on social media and by telling your friends about our artists
 and campaign. 
Thank you so much!

</div><p><b>McKenzie Music Business Model</b></p><p>Say if you have two pieces of paper and you rip it in exactly half, you are left with two halves. One half is kept by me so for conversation purposes, disregard it. The other half is what's left. Using auction language, lets say the ""auction"" of the other half has a reserve of $100,000. </p><p>One person buys it all for $100,000. They now own 50% of the rights to this music. Say one person spends $50,000 and two people spend $25,000 and $25,000. The person that spent $50,000 owns 50% of the 50% available and the other two people own 25% each of the 50% percent available. 50% + 25% +25% equals 100%. Very simple mathematics. A little more difficult is when one person decides to pay $200,000 for the 50% available. They still own 100% of the 50% available, just at a higher $200,000 price. Even more difficult still is if one person puts up $200,000 and two others still put $25,000 each then the total becomes $250,000 and the one person who payed $200,000 now owns 75% of the 50% available and the two others that payed $25,000 each now own 12.5% of the 50% available each. $50,000 is 25% of $250,000. Etc etc etc. This will music rights model will revolutionize everything music commerce related.</p>A revelation has happened. An epiphany of sorts. I, Donald Sturge Anthony McKenzie II, will no longer participate in the ""pay for exposure"" game (more on what I define as ""pay for exposure"" later). <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I can no longer sell myself short or undercut my art by grouping myself with slackers, people that are still trying to decide what instrument they're gonna play to get the most fans, people that want to croon and have roses thrown to them onstage cause they were an outcast in high school and psychologically still want to impress that chick that dated the football star but ignored the nerds.</span><div>
<br/><div>
<div>Those days are over. Don't even ask me to consider your artistic existence unless you are willing to compensate me like a senior oncologist at Sloan Kettering.<p></p>
<p>Embracing ones artistic integrity means that one might as well do EXACTLY what they want, perform with exactly who they want, and create exactly the art that's going to psychologically stimulate them the most. This Indiegogo campaign is the first (albeit initially small) step to further this personal, creative and psychologically empowering agenda. More details to come........</p>

<p>THE FAILING ""CLUB"" BUSINESS MODEL:</p>
<p>The historical business model of a musician that wanted exposure for their creative output was that they played ""clubs"". Clubs consisted of venues relatively close to their home base where for minimal advertising they could showcase or exhibit their work for interested parties in hopes of peaking interest in said work and that interest spreading by word of mouth. As that interest spreads, the artist can do more of the same type of venues gradually increasing the size of his or her audience. Larger audiences in turn brings a larger economic recompense by allowing the artist to dictate more of his or her ""take"" in negotiations with the venue. What's usually up for negotiations with a venue or club owner is the revenue from concert receipts. The ""door"" per se. The club owner usually wants to cover his overhead for the exhibition of your music. His or her overhead could include, security, sound engineer, logistical people, clean up crew. etc and whoever else they may decide to tack on to your ""bill"" for the honour of performing in their hallowed venue. More on this later..........</p>

<p>GRAHAM HAYNES has agreed to participate in the aural and visual recording and presentation. Graham Haynes is an ICON instrumentalist and composer.</p>
<p>His bio is as follows:</p>
<p>Regarded as an innovator on cornet and flugelhorn, an extraordinary composer, and an emerging force in contemporary electronic music and world music, Graham Haynes has redefined and deconstructed that genre we still call ""jazz"".</p>
<p>Graham Haynes was born in 1960 and raised in Hollis , Queens ,NY. He is the son of jazz legend Roy Haynes . His neighbors growing up were Milt Jackson, Jaki Byard and Roy Eldridge.</p>
<p>His two years at Queens College (1978-1980) studying composition, harmony and theory spurred his interest in classical and electronic music (Robert Moog was professor of electronic music at the time). Haynes became a disciplined student , studying privately with Gillespie alumnus Dave Burns while playing in the Pentecostal church.</p>
<p>In1979 he met alto saxophonist Steve Coleman. They formed a band called Five Elements, which launched the M-Base collective, an influential group of NY improvisers.

</div></div>","McKenzie Music Business ModelSay if you have two pieces of paper and you rip it in exactly half, you are left with two halves. One half is kept by me so for conversation purposes, disregard it. The other half is what's left. Using auction language, lets say the ""auction"" of the other half has a reserve of $100,000. One person buys it all for $100,000. They now own 50% of the rights to this music. Say one person spends $50,000 and two people spend $25,000 and $25,000. The person that spent $50,000 owns 50% of the 50% available and the other two people own 25% each of the 50% percent available. 50% + 25% +25% equals 100%. Very simple mathematics. A little more difficult is when one person decides to pay $200,000 for the 50% available. They still own 100% of the 50% available, just at a higher $200,000 price. Even more difficult still is if one person puts up $200,000 and two others still put $25,000 each then the total becomes $250,000 and the one person who payed $200,000 now owns 75% of the 50% available and the two others that payed $25,000 each now own 12.5% of the 50% available each. $50,000 is 25% of $250,000. Etc etc etc. This will music rights model will revolutionize everything music commerce related.A revelation has happened. An epiphany of sorts. I, Donald Sturge Anthony McKenzie II, will no longer participate in the ""pay for exposure"" game (more on what I define as ""pay for exposure"" later). I can no longer sell myself short or undercut my art by grouping myself with slackers, people that are still trying to decide what instrument they're gonna play to get the most fans, people that want to croon and have roses thrown to them onstage cause they were an outcast in high school and psychologically still want to impress that chick that dated the football star but ignored the nerds.

Those days are over. Don't even ask me to consider your artistic existence unless you are willing to compensate me like a senior oncologist at Sloan Kettering.
Embracing ones artistic integrity means that one might as well do EXACTLY what they want, perform with exactly who they want, and create exactly the art that's going to psychologically stimulate them the most. This Indiegogo campaign is the first (albeit initially small) step to further this personal, creative and psychologically empowering agenda. More details to come........

THE FAILING ""CLUB"" BUSINESS MODEL:
The historical business model of a musician that wanted exposure for their creative output was that they played ""clubs"". Clubs consisted of venues relatively close to their home base where for minimal advertising they could showcase or exhibit their work for interested parties in hopes of peaking interest in said work and that interest spreading by word of mouth. As that interest spreads, the artist can do more of the same type of venues gradually increasing the size of his or her audience. Larger audiences in turn brings a larger economic recompense by allowing the artist to dictate more of his or her ""take"" in negotiations with the venue. What's usually up for negotiations with a venue or club owner is the revenue from concert receipts. The ""door"" per se. The club owner usually wants to cover his overhead for the exhibition of your music. His or her overhead could include, security, sound engineer, logistical people, clean up crew. etc and whoever else they may decide to tack on to your ""bill"" for the honour of performing in their hallowed venue. More on this later..........

<span>Short description</span><br/>
</h1>
<p>IMOGEN is the chamber ensemble of the International Mahler Orchestra. <span></span><span>IMOGEN is a brand new ensemble - and is celebrating its birth with a concert tour in Germany in May 2016:<br/></span></p>
<p><b><span>1 May - Frankfurt (Goethe Universität) - 6 pm<br/></span></b></p>
<p><b><span>2 May - Hamburg (resonanzraum) - 7 pm<br/></span></b></p>
<p><b><span>3 May - Kassel (documenta-Halle) - 7 pm</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>4 May - Berlin (Konzerthaus Berlin) - 7 pm</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>5 May - Berlin (Stummfilmkino Delphi) - 7 pm</span></b></p>
<p><span><b><br/></b></span></p>
<p><span><b>For this tour we need your support.</b><br/></span></p>
<p><span><b><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/internationalmahlerorchestra/g-mahler-adagio-finale-from-symphony-no-9-selection"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Listen to IMOGEN</a></b><br/></span></p>
<p><span>An IMOGEN concert is no ordinary concert experience. It is an artistic adventure where the audience sits as close as possible to the stage. We believe that music is best experienced authentically and emotionally; up close and personal. 

As supporters of IMOGEN, you are enabling us to compensate our talented musicians. We also have to pay fees to GEMA and the venues and finance the travel costs, as our musicians come from all over the world.</span></p>
<h1><span>What you give/What you get</span></h1>
<p><span>We need 12.000 Euros for the musicians' fees, bus transport and hotel rooms. We are paying all of the participants - including the organizers - very small fees. This is a passion project if there ever was one and for everyone involved, a huge leap of faith.

IMOGEN loves its audience. We don't just want to play for you - and give everything that we have. We want to know you - and share our love of music with you in a personal way. 

That's why we are offering you tickets, meet and greets with the musicians and even an insider experience in the tour bus and hotel with the musicians.</span></p>
<h1><span>The results</span></h1>

Short description

IMOGEN is the chamber ensemble of the International Mahler Orchestra. IMOGEN is a brand new ensemble - and is celebrating its birth with a concert tour in Germany in May 2016:
1 May - Frankfurt (Goethe Universität) - 6 pm
2 May - Hamburg (resonanzraum) - 7 pm
3 May - Kassel (documenta-Halle) - 7 pm
4 May - Berlin (Konzerthaus Berlin) - 7 pm
5 May - Berlin (Stummfilmkino Delphi) - 7 pm

For this tour we need your support.
Listen to IMOGEN
An IMOGEN concert is no ordinary concert experience. It is an artistic adventure where the audience sits as close as possible to the stage. We believe that music is best experienced authentically and emotionally; up close and personal. 

As supporters of IMOGEN, you are enabling us to compensate our talented musicians. We also have to pay fees to GEMA and the venues and finance the travel costs, as our musicians come from all over the world.
What you give/What you get
We need 12.000 Euros for the musicians' fees, bus transport and hotel rooms. We are paying all of the participants - including the organizers - very small fees. This is a passion project if there ever was one and for everyone involved, a huge leap of faith.

IMOGEN loves its audience. We don't just want to play for you - and give everything that we have. We want to know you - and share our love of music with you in a personal way. 

That's why we are offering you tickets, meet and greets with the musicians and even an insider experience in the tour bus and hotel with the musicians.
The results
With IMOGEN, you can experience a fresh, new musical experience. IMOGEN doesn't like routine. We play Björk, Bartók and Bach. Passion, unfiltered energy and unlimited beauty are the ideas closest to our hearts. If you help us with this project, we promise you our deepest emotions.
The International Mahler Orchestra - the big brother of IMOGEN - performed the world premiere of Yoel Gamzou's reconstruction of Gustav Mahler's 10th Symphony on the 5th of September, 2010 at the Jewish Cultural Festival in the Synagogue in the Rykestraße in Berlin. That was the day a group of musicians found each other and decided to take a leap of faith to build a fresh, new ensemble that exceeds the standard musical expectations.
Risks and Challenges
To make music means to take a risk. In particular, what and how we play. IMOGEN is completely new - so it isn't easy for us to find sponsors for this project. That's where you come in.
Other ways to help us
We understand that not everyone is in the position to finance our project. You are still more than welcome to come support us live at our concerts - and are also very welcome than welcome to share our campaign via social media.

If you come to our concerts and/or share our campaign on your social media pages, it's just as helpful as 50 euros.

Für diese Tour brauchen wir Ihre Unterstützung.
Hören Sie mal zu


IMOGEN teilt eine ungewöhnliche musikalische Erfahrung mit Ihnen. Bei uns sitzt das Publikum immer ganz nah an den Musikern. Denn wir glauben daran, dass Musik authentisch, emotional und hautnah erlebt werden sollte. So, als ob die gespielten Werke zum ersten Mal erklingen würden.


Unsere Unterstützer helfen uns, unsere Musiker bezahlen zu können. Außerdem spielen wir auch Werke, die GEMA-pflichtig sind. Und natürlich müssen wir zwischen den Konzertorten reisen und nachts mit einem Dach über dem Kopf schlafen.


 
 
Was Sie uns geben
Was Sie bekommen

 
Wir brauchen 12.000 Euro für die Musikerhonorare, die Bus-Reisen und die Hotel-Übernachtungen. Wir zahlen allen Beteiligten - auch den Organisatoren - nur kleine Gagen. Das Ganze ist ein Herzensprojekt - und für alle ein Risiko.


IMOGEN liebt sein Publikum. Wir wollen nicht nur für Sie spielen - und dabei alles geben, was unsere Saiten hergeben. Wir wollen Sie kennenlernen - und unsere Liebe zur Musik gemeinsam teilen.


Deshalb bieten wir Ihnen für Ihr wertvolles Geld unter anderem Tickets, Treffen mit den Musikern und eine aufregende - und sicher lustige - Reise mit den Musikern im Tourbus an.


 
 
Die Folgen
 
Sie können mit IMOGEN eine besondere abenteuerliche Erfahrung mit ganz viel Musik machen. IMOGEN mag Routine nicht. Wir spielen Musik von Björk, Zappa, Ravel, Bartók und Bach. Wichtig ist nur die Leidenschaft, die Wildheit, die unaufhörliche Schönheit. Unsere Emotionalität im Spiel ist unser Versprechen an Sie!


Mit IMOGEN ist eine Gruppe von Musikern entstanden, deren Arbeit wir wichtig finden - und nun seriös in die Zukunft führen möchten.
 
 
 
Risiken & Herausforderungen
 
IMOGEN ist ganz neu - und es ist nicht leicht für ein noch nicht bekanntes Projekt Sponsoren zu finden. Deshalb wenden wir uns an Sie.

The participants each bring a traditional tune from their home culture, forming a ""folk orchestra"" that performs at local concerts and outdoor arenas in mid August.The aim of my participation is to compile recordings, transcripts to offer funders and incorporate my learning into my future teachings.Below is a picture of a sample 8GB flash card I hope to produce:Bio:With over twenty years of experience I have a folk album under my belt with my band 'Just Us' and teaching and festival experience in Belgium, UK, Australia and Ireland.I completed my Grade 8 in Irish Music with distinction in 2013 and taught at the Turning Wave Irish Festival Australia in 2014Following this I was fortunate to attend Ethno Australia in Brisbane and be part of a Folk Ensemble of 30 musicians who performed to 10,000 people at The Woodford Folk Festival(thats me in the red dress!)I have always wanted to learn more Scandinavian music and attending Ethno Norway will enhance my current skills and enable me to study other folk genres intensely within a week.With your kind support, I will be able to attend Ethno Norway and return with lots of music recordings, videos, photographs and music notations!My educational background in in Digital Media/Television Production so I hope to produce strong audiovisual content that funders will treasure..How the funds will be usedYour contribution will help me to afford: (sterling equivalent)- Travel from Ireland (Dublin) to Norway (Bodø) 240- Participation Fee for Ethno Norway 120- Cost of Materials & Production (Postcards, Cd's, Flash Drives, Books) 400- Data Loading & Editing 150 - Fees(Indiegogo & Credit Card Fees) 240 - Postage 240 Total: 1390 pounds sterling.Working in AustraliaCurrently I am working in Australia as a carer and I teach and perform music in my spare time in the Sydney region.I hope to gain employment when I return to Eire (Ireland) in late July.Having a funded trip to Norway would be a dream come true and one of the highlights of my musical career to date.I am no stranger to Ethno and have attended Ethno Flanders (Belgium) in 2012 and again in 2014.

<p>The songs that have been written for this album are very personal to me and make me vulnerable because it's my heart, my experiences, my failures and my worries which is my lack of faith! But I have been called to turn these experiences into songs. The way I write is to challenge the listener but give resolution and encouragement. In the midst of various struggles and trials in my life i've thought that I was alone but after reminder from God I know there are many fellow brothers and sisters that are in or have gone through the storms!! I believe these songs will be applicable to you in there own special ways :)</p>

This stellar lineup gives life to seven of Vint's original compositions and two of Ian Stapp's, as well as Vint's arrangements of songs by Neil Young and The Sons of the Pioneers.  To some, these songs will surely fall into the ""jazz"" category as they are instrumental and prominently feature improvisation, but the album taken as a whole is truly un-categorizable.  We hope you enjoy the music!

<h3>My Story</h3>
<div>My name is Allison Barber and I am a singer-songwriter based out of Brooklyn, NY.  I am currently in the process of releasing my debut album, <i>The Birds in the Bushes</i>. I have spent the better part of the last two years working with producer and guitarist, Kyle Sanna, to put together an album comprised of my original songs. Together with Mike Savino (bass), Mathias Kunzli (drums/percussion) and Caitlin Warbelow (fiddle) we recorded the final album at Hoboken Recorders in Hoboken, NJ. Having performed for most of my life in multiple genres of music, I can honestly say this is the most excited I have been about a project. My songs draw from life experiences, lessons I've learned and the artists who have inspired me. Working through this process with such an incredible group of musicians, I have found a musical voice that is truly my own.  <br/>

<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;"">The Impact</span><br/></p>
<p>I am always searching for ways in which I can make an impact on the world and give back through music. I am beyond grateful to all of those incredible individuals in my life who have shown me support and love. It is my aim above all else to be able to provide this kind of support and assistance to others, especially those living in poverty. My searching has led me to The Microcredit Summit Campaign, a project of the Results Educational Fund. Deeply inspired by the organization's incredible efforts to end poverty in people's lives, I came to one of the most important decisions of my life - the decision to act. <br/></p>

<p>Microfinance, or Microcredit is the extension of small loans and other financial services (such as savings accounts, financial education, support groups, and health care) to individuals and families living below the poverty line, allowing them to pursue entrepreneurial projects that generate extra income. Essentially, these small loans and support groups enable these individuals and families to work themselves out of poverty - with dignity. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>

<h3>The Story</h3>After learning a lot about what goes into making an album, promoting it and getting it heard, I realized that although I had some songs on the radio, I needed a lot more power behind me to get those songs played over and over again. Now, there are so many ways for a song to get exposure- television, movies- and you like to hope that the video you shot for it goes viral overnight ;)<br/>But along with this 'do-it-yourself' market, comes expenses that a single person cannot put forth on their own. That's what record companies used to do. Now it's up to the artist. I've been singing a set of songs live for over a year that people keep asking me for a way to download or purchase- that's always a good sign. But all I have to offer is my original product, which as an indie artist was a great accomplishment- but also full of good teaching tools, called mistakes. This time around I have a great team of musicians behind me, a plan of musical direction, contacts in the industry, a sense of humor, and a lawyer.<br/><h3>The Goal</h3>My $24,000 goal is actually a pretty humble sum for what I want to do with it. It should be enough to create a rocking record, with cool (green-conscious) packaging &amp; design. The money will pay for production, studio costs, musicians, mixing, mastering, and manufacturing. Should the goal not be reached, I will move forward with production- after figuring out how many songs we can get done within the budget.<br/>

<h3>The Story of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Last Spring</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>After I graduated from college with a music degree, I figured the only way to productively pursue music without being swallowed whole by my student loan debt would be to get a day job and gig at night. Well, the day job changed everything, including my musical goals. I ended up recording for free at a student-run studio at the art school I worked for, and that's how <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Last Spring</span> was born. It was premature and not very well planned, but in the months since the recording sessions went down, this baby has gotten healthy and much stronger. It's busting out of it's 6-12 month clothes and wants to run!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Made up of 5 original songs (one of which just won an ASCAP Young Jazz Composers Award) and three of my favorite standards, the album features some of the Bay Area's best musicians, including saxophonist <a href=""http://www.daynomastephens.c"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Dayna Stephens</a>, flutist <a href=""http://www.geraldbeckett.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Gerald Beckett</a>, guitarist Jack Riordan, bassist Jesse Cafiero and drummers Jimmy Gallagher and Brandon Etzler. It has been mixed by engineer <a href=""http://www.ahammer.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Gary Hobish</a>, who will also master it. Jazz vocal sensation and my mentor <a href=""http://www.kittymargolis.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Kitty Margolis</a> has arranging credits on this, and a surprise producer has just signed on to do some final pro bono work to ensure this album sounds stellar. We're not going to let you down! <br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<h4 style=""font-weight: normal;"">
<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Last Spring</span> was recorded last year and has since been funded mostly by my administrative assistant salary. It is in it's final stages of production, but it needs your help! I have already had some phenomenal photos taken for the album cover by San Francisco photographer <a href=""http://www.vweberphotography.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Veronica Weber</a> (as seen on this page), but am still finalizing the artwork. From there I will need to package and distribute the album, pay royalty fees, and pay for continued promotion (radio, print, web, etc.). </h4>On a broader scale, this album is significant because it's new, original work by a young group of jazz artists in the Bay Area. It is notably lamented that many talented young jazz artists of the Bay Area move to NYC for better work. This album is proof that there is still a scene and still musicians working hard to keep jazz alive in San Francisco. By supporting this album, you are also supporting this fact. <br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am asking for $2,500. This will cover studio fees for extra sessions with the producer that graciously offered his time to make this album sparkle. Additionally, this will cover mastering costs, album artwork fees, cd duplication for a run of 300 cds, and payment of royalties. I do not anticipate left over funds, but in the event there are any, they will go directly toward promotion.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>There are some cool incentives to this donation process if you're in the mood to give! I'm excited to share them with you. If you love the idea but cannot make a monetary contribution, no 
problem! Just by stopping by you have shown that you care, 
which means the world to me. If you want to stay in touch and hear about
 my musical endeavors, I hope you will sign up for my mailing list (which you can do while simultaneously downloading one of my songs for free! See below). </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Here are some other ways to help this campaign:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Spread the word via facebook, twitter, your blog or email (or some other social networking site I know nothing about) with a word or two of acknowledgment. My hope is to have many donors contributing less than $50. The coolest part of the crowd funding phenomenon is that it's community based. No one needs to put themselves out to contribute. Also, with Indiegogo, you don't have to sign in and make a new account. I have made contributions on this site for other deserving artists and like how quick and easy the process is. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Spread the word at work and drag your co-workers out to my next happy hour gig! By the time the cd release party rolls around, we'll all be good friends. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>As promised, as a thank you for stopping by today, here is the link to download my song, 'Nobody Bothers Me' from Bandcamp for free! I recorded it back in 2008 for a demo with Larry Dunlap, an incredible Bay Area pianist. <br/></p>

The Story of Last Spring

After I graduated from college with a music degree, I figured the only way to productively pursue music without being swallowed whole by my student loan debt would be to get a day job and gig at night. Well, the day job changed everything, including my musical goals. I ended up recording for free at a student-run studio at the art school I worked for, and that's how Last Spring was born. It was premature and not very well planned, but in the months since the recording sessions went down, this baby has gotten healthy and much stronger. It's busting out of it's 6-12 month clothes and wants to run!

Made up of 5 original songs (one of which just won an ASCAP Young Jazz Composers Award) and three of my favorite standards, the album features some of the Bay Area's best musicians, including saxophonist Dayna Stephens, flutist Gerald Beckett, guitarist Jack Riordan, bassist Jesse Cafiero and drummers Jimmy Gallagher and Brandon Etzler. It has been mixed by engineer Gary Hobish, who will also master it. Jazz vocal sensation and my mentor Kitty Margolis has arranging credits on this, and a surprise producer has just signed on to do some final pro bono work to ensure this album sounds stellar. We're not going to let you down! 

The Impact

Last Spring was recorded last year and has since been funded mostly by my administrative assistant salary. It is in it's final stages of production, but it needs your help! I have already had some phenomenal photos taken for the album cover by San Francisco photographer Veronica Weber (as seen on this page), but am still finalizing the artwork. From there I will need to package and distribute the album, pay royalty fees, and pay for continued promotion (radio, print, web, etc.). On a broader scale, this album is significant because it's new, original work by a young group of jazz artists in the Bay Area. It is notably lamented that many talented young jazz artists of the Bay Area move to NYC for better work. This album is proof that there is still a scene and still musicians working hard to keep jazz alive in San Francisco. By supporting this album, you are also supporting this fact. 

What We Need & What You Get
I am asking for $2,500. This will cover studio fees for extra sessions with the producer that graciously offered his time to make this album sparkle. Additionally, this will cover mastering costs, album artwork fees, cd duplication for a run of 300 cds, and payment of royalties. I do not anticipate left over funds, but in the event there are any, they will go directly toward promotion.

There are some cool incentives to this donation process if you're in the mood to give! I'm excited to share them with you. If you love the idea but cannot make a monetary contribution, no 
problem! Just by stopping by you have shown that you care, 
which means the world to me. If you want to stay in touch and hear about
 my musical endeavors, I hope you will sign up for my mailing list (which you can do while simultaneously downloading one of my songs for free! See below). 


Other Ways You Can Help
Here are some other ways to help this campaign:

Spread the word via facebook, twitter, your blog or email (or some other social networking site I know nothing about) with a word or two of acknowledgment. My hope is to have many donors contributing less than $50. The coolest part of the crowd funding phenomenon is that it's community based. No one needs to put themselves out to contribute. Also, with Indiegogo, you don't have to sign in and make a new account. I have made contributions on this site for other deserving artists and like how quick and easy the process is. 

Spread the word at work and drag your co-workers out to my next happy hour gig! By the time the cd release party rolls around, we'll all be good friends. 

As promised, as a thank you for stopping by today, here is the link to download my song, 'Nobody Bothers Me' from Bandcamp for free! I recorded it back in 2008 for a demo with Larry Dunlap, an incredible Bay Area pianist.

<strong><strong>Bio:<br/></strong></strong><span class=""notranslate"">Like all human beings, Kevin’s search for truth has always directed the course of his life. But this search intensified tremendously during a dark and transformative period in his teenage years.

In and out of corrective institutions, he struggled to find meaning in life... until he discovered modern spiritual texts, bringing a clarity to his experience. The birth of his hip-hop music arose out of a necessity to process his experiences, serving to heal himself and inspire change in others through a positive, uplifting message of self realization.

<p>This is the 3rd photo project we are working to create and want to level up to create something we hope will be something unique.  The basic concepts are the battle between good and evil.  We are planning to create a powerful and beautiful Valkyrie battling a fire breathing dragon.  We have a talented team of artist to create our dragon that can breathe fire and our Valkyrie with a flaming sword. </p>
<p><strong><em>We are asking your help to cover the costs of creating the cinematic makeup and custom made fire sword.</em></strong></p>
<h2>Support the Arts and become a Patron</h2>
<p>We will need to make armor for our Valkyrie that will include a custom fire sword and shield. Our dragon with have extensive prosthetic makeup. There is also body paint, costume and beautiful makeup.</p>
<p>In the past we have covered the cost through donation and just out of our pocket.  We do these art projects for the love of art.  This next project is something we hope to be a signature piece for our group. </p>
<ol>
<li>The estimated cost for the Dragon is between 750-850. </li>

These are a couple of actors from previous projects.

 




Let us introduce ourselves
I am Eric Anderson and I would like to ask to become an art patron and support a photographic project some friends and I are working on. 
We are a collaborative group called team sparks. We are a group of artist with many skills that include dancers, models, fire performers, cinematic makeup artists and of course a photographer. 






Sylvia Vale
The Valkyrie





Ivan Van Norman
The Dragon





KC Mussman
Freelance Makeup Artist 



KC is a graduate of Cinema Makeup School in Los Angles, CA


 



Team Sparks 
The crew behind the camera magic.
       Here is Team Sparks in action from a segment of LAaRTS for PBSSOCAL. 
















This is the 3rd photo project we are working to create and want to level up to create something we hope will be something unique.  The basic concepts are the battle between good and evil.  We are planning to create a powerful and beautiful Valkyrie battling a fire breathing dragon.  We have a talented team of artist to create our dragon that can breathe fire and our Valkyrie with a flaming sword. 
We are asking your help to cover the costs of creating the cinematic makeup and custom made fire sword.
Support the Arts and become a Patron
We will need to make armor for our Valkyrie that will include a custom fire sword and shield. Our dragon with have extensive prosthetic makeup. There is also body paint, costume and beautiful makeup.
In the past we have covered the cost through donation and just out of our pocket.  We do these art projects for the love of art.  This next project is something we hope to be a signature piece for our group. 

The estimated cost for the Dragon is between 750-850. 
The Valkyrie is about 600-700. 
The sword will be about 300. 
The remaining amount is to cover costume, additional final look makeup and fuel and other additional expenses.  Everyone is giving their time and energy to make this happen. 

There will be test shooting and proof of concept shots. Our Valkyrie will be training to work with a large sword on fire.  We will need to shoot with our dragon so our exposure on location is perfect.  We will share our progress so you can see the concept take shape.

<h3>Walking Revival</h3>
<p>Hello everyone.  Thank you for visiting our Indiegogo campaign!  We appriciate the time that you are taking to consider helping our group with our Debut EP release ""A Letter To The Fallen""!</p>
<p>Walking Revival is a group of musicians that got together about a year ago with a goal in mind:  To write, record, produce, and release an EP album then perform where ever we can.  We started with the end in mind and are just about to finish the first part of the project which is where you come in!</p>
<p>Walking Revival is Justin Kopchick-Front Man Lead Vocals, Bobby Fielder- Bass Guitar and background vocals, RJ Butler-Guitar and background vocals, and Cole Sandin keepin' the beat goin' on the drum kit.</p>
<p>We all played with other groups before we put WR together.  So when we started we decided that we would concentrate on writing and arranging music first and once we had enough songs we would release an EP and then begin performing.</p>
<p>Thats is where we are at now and why we are asking for your help!  We have been working with DSC Studios since January arranging, recording and producing our music.  (Huge Thanks to Drew Hodge our Producer!) </p>
<p>Since we are all still in school and have to concentrate on our studies a project of this magnatude could take a very long time to complete. By releasing this campaign and your willingness to pre-order our music and merchandise we will be able to Rock a lot sooner than later!  With your help we will be able to achieve what would have taken at least a couple of years (maybe even 3 or 4) now.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have just about completed our songs at DSC Studios in Albuquerque, NM.  We have paid for most of the recording fees at the studio already to show the commitment that we have made and to have some skin in the game!</p>
<p>So what we are trying to achieve by this campaign is to be able to raise the balance due to DSC Studios, press our EP album on CD, and distribute our music digitally to the world.  Our goal is to raise $ 1,600.00.  This is the minimum amount that we need to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>The balance to DSC Studios.</li>
<li>Produce our first CD run.</li>
<li>The cost of digital distrubution (Including barcodes, registration fees, etc.)</li>
<li>Produce the mechandise pre-sold on this campaign</li>
<li>Indiegogo fees</li>
</ul>
<p>You get an opportunity to help a young band get off to a solid start, get introduced to some great music, score some Awesome stuff and get lots of recognition in the process.  Some of the perks even give you an opportunity to be named as one of 3 levels of producer on the project!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Mike Morrisseau and I am a guitarist based out of Edmonton, Canada.</p>
<p>I am going to be recording an EP of all original compositions. A very guitar driven and heavy jazz sound with lots of great harmony and melody. I am very excited about this project and will have some of Canada's best musicians on board. I have been working on the tunes for this album for 4 years and am ready to get them recorded and out to an audience.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I will need about $5000 to get this project out and pressed, so any contribution will help me out alot.</p>
<p>Where does the money go?</p>
<p>I need to pay for studio time which does not include mixing and mastering, Musician fees for my band, artwork, mixing, mastering, Pressing and distribution. All of these factors add up to be quite expensive, so any donation will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>I really want to get this album out, it has been sitting and stewing in my mind for way to long now, its time to get the music out!</p>

<p>The Michigan Recital Project grew out of a love for our home state and a desire to program a recital that celebrates Michigan’s history and culture.  Early on, we realized that there wasn’t enough music out there to make up an entire recital.  “Well, this is criminal!” we said to ourselves, “Especially since there is such a wealth of musically talented Michiganders out there!”  So we commissioned four young composers to write some Michigan chamber music for us.  We are very excited about what they came up with, from poetry to pop music to urban gardens.  And they agreed to work for much less than they’re worth.  We would like to compensate them a little bit better for creating such amazing pieces.  This is where you come in!</p>
<p><strong>The Big Picture</strong> </p>
<p>We believe that all 21<sup>st</sup> century musicians have a responsibility to commission new works to help create the music that will define our time.  Your donations will directly impact the livelihood of young composers, and because we want to continue supporting emerging composers, 100% of any funds raised above our goal of $2500 will go to future Michigan Recital commissions. </p>

This is my very first Delisco James national independent original tour. I want you guys the fans to be involved for the artist, we've all worked countless hours putting together this show and the tour for you all to enjoy. 

The Impact
The impact of this tour is infinite, from bring you good vibrations to uplifting the spirits of displaced children around the nation and eventually around the world. If our tour doesn't happen we will try again, but with the help of you and your network we are confident that the manifestation of this campaign will occur.


What We Need & What You Get
Our goal is to raise $5,000 to rent an RV and cover most of our travel expenses.  This is very important for us to make it safely to each venue and put on an amazing show for you.  We have some great incentives for all who help us with this part of the campaign. If we don't meet our entire goal we will try to explore other options to fulfill the mission of this campaign until we achieve our mission. 
Here is a list of some of the things you may get depending on how much is given to the campaign:
You may get a personally signed EP, other merchandise, discounted and/or free concert tickets, backstage passes, private parties.

</div></div>","Our Story
There's a dream among many people in Cebu right now to have an orchestra development program available for its youth, especially the underprivileged.


A family in Cebu once funded a 10-year orchestra development program for gifted, underprivileged kids from the year 1990 to 2000. At least 30 of these kids have gone on to become professional musicians and teachers around their country and other parts of the world. 

There is a program in Venezuela which has transformed the lives of more than 2 million children from lives of crime and destruction to lives of responsibility and inspiration, through music education and performance. The dream in Cebu now is to have such a program available for her people.

As a member of the family that funded the first long-term orchestra development program in Cebu, the mission to continue this work is very much a part of me.


The Impact
Out of my being given the chance to go on a 3-month trip to North and South America for the observation of music systems, volunteer work, and network building, I hope to come home to Cebu, Philippines, and develop what we have now into a sustainable world class music education and performance system, in partnership with  individuals,organizations and artists throughout the world.

<p>                          From the whole band to you the viewer THANK YOU :) in advance for taking the time to take a look at our
campaign and for your consideration. We (Find The Fallen) are a Yorkton,
Saskatchewan based Christian Rock/Worship band that has just formed over the
last year and a half. But we have been truly blessed in our short time to have
already done two Western Canada Tours with (2x) Christian hip hop Grammy nominee
Fresh IE out of Winnipeg, Manitoba along with many othe<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">r gigs around
Saskatchewan and Manitoba. The Band consists of five members, Jon Tieszen (lead vocals), Crystal Tieszen (lead/backup vocals/Piano), Kyle Brewer (drums), Troy Janzen (bass) and Dustin Wilson (Lead Guitar).</span></p>
<p>    This campaign is so important to us because of our passion
for this generation of hurting youth. As a young band between the ages of 23-33
we desire to let this generation know that they don't have to live broken and
destructive lives. That there is a purpose and plan for everyone of them where
they themselves can make a difference in the world with their gifts and
talents. With Alcohol, drug , sexual, physical and mental abuse along with teen
suicide on the rise, our hearts desire to leave a mark of love upon each and
everyone of them. As individuals we have all faced this in one form or another
and through out testimonies we've been able to minister at many youth events
sharing our hearts and gifts to make a positive impact in their lives. With the
pressures they face each day continually growing, we want to bring the message
hope of Love and Purpose through Jesus Christ (who is Love). We have played our
own personal music and give our own personal testimonies everywhere we go, but
we do not have a CD to get into the hands of youth. That is why this campaign
is so important, because it will give us that opportunity to reach more and
more youth, not just in our own back yards, but around the world.</p>
<p>    As i mentioned, our desire is to get this message world
wide. There are many that say they want to do it and there are few that
actually commit themselves to doing it. We are one of the committed few who are
going to do this. Your support will not just effect the lives of each of our
band members but impact a whole generation. We truly believe no matter how much
you are able to contribute, any heart that is reached and every life that is
transformed will be laid to your account as well as ours. We are in this
together and no one is greater than the other but all have an equal roll. </p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp;
What You Get</b></p>
<p>   There are three major needs we have at this point. We need
funds to be able to get our CD mixed and mastered so we can release something
of quality. Our second need is to be able to get the CD's printed and labelled
for distribution. Finally, the distribution itself. There are a few companies that we are aware of that can help us get our songs to radio and that will get the ball rolling for sure.</p><p>The cost for mixing and mastering for our 10 song CD is $3000
(We have started this process at Studio 11 in Winnipeg, Manitoba) and we
already have raised half of this ($1,500) through shows, performances, family
and friends. We are trying to raise as much of this cost without this so we can have our mixing and mastering process compete by mid-May.

                          From the whole band to you the viewer THANK YOU :) in advance for taking the time to take a look at our
campaign and for your consideration. We (Find The Fallen) are a Yorkton,
Saskatchewan based Christian Rock/Worship band that has just formed over the
last year and a half. But we have been truly blessed in our short time to have
already done two Western Canada Tours with (2x) Christian hip hop Grammy nominee
Fresh IE out of Winnipeg, Manitoba along with many other gigs around
Saskatchewan and Manitoba. The Band consists of five members, Jon Tieszen (lead vocals), Crystal Tieszen (lead/backup vocals/Piano), Kyle Brewer (drums), Troy Janzen (bass) and Dustin Wilson (Lead Guitar).
    This campaign is so important to us because of our passion
for this generation of hurting youth. As a young band between the ages of 23-33
we desire to let this generation know that they don't have to live broken and
destructive lives. That there is a purpose and plan for everyone of them where
they themselves can make a difference in the world with their gifts and
talents. With Alcohol, drug , sexual, physical and mental abuse along with teen
suicide on the rise, our hearts desire to leave a mark of love upon each and
everyone of them. As individuals we have all faced this in one form or another
and through out testimonies we've been able to minister at many youth events
sharing our hearts and gifts to make a positive impact in their lives. With the
pressures they face each day continually growing, we want to bring the message
hope of Love and Purpose through Jesus Christ (who is Love). We have played our
own personal music and give our own personal testimonies everywhere we go, but
we do not have a CD to get into the hands of youth. That is why this campaign
is so important, because it will give us that opportunity to reach more and
more youth, not just in our own back yards, but around the world.
    As i mentioned, our desire is to get this message world
wide. There are many that say they want to do it and there are few that
actually commit themselves to doing it. We are one of the committed few who are
going to do this. Your support will not just effect the lives of each of our
band members but impact a whole generation. We truly believe no matter how much
you are able to contribute, any heart that is reached and every life that is
transformed will be laid to your account as well as ours. We are in this
together and no one is greater than the other but all have an equal roll. 
What We Need &
What You Get
   There are three major needs we have at this point. We need
funds to be able to get our CD mixed and mastered so we can release something
of quality. Our second need is to be able to get the CD's printed and labelled
for distribution. Finally, the distribution itself. There are a few companies that we are aware of that can help us get our songs to radio and that will get the ball rolling for sure.The cost for mixing and mastering for our 10 song CD is $3000
(We have started this process at Studio 11 in Winnipeg, Manitoba) and we
already have raised half of this ($1,500) through shows, performances, family
and friends. We are trying to raise as much of this cost without this so we can have our mixing and mastering process compete by mid-May. But if we are unable to do that we will use what we get from here to finish that part of the project.The cost of the CD printing and labeling for 2000 CD's (our
target) is about $1.25-1.50 per CD (between $2,500-3000 dollars).The cost of distribution will run right around $1000. This will get our product to radio stations across north america and possibly even around the world.The Total we would really like to achieve and would make all this doable is $4,500
NOTHING of this campaign is going into our own personal pockets and that
is our promise!
If we do not reach our Goal all of the contributions will just continue
to pave the way for our CD to be produced. That is our focus and desire.
The Impact
Our Vision is not a selfish or one of small proportion for that matter.
We truly want to go to all the world for the cause of seeing lives transformed
and changed and this is just one of the avenues that we are able to do that. We
desire to go on missions trips and do tours that will take us to places where

This will either be made ​​possible through continuous reservations like above, or through collaborations with additional artists in Sweden and Scandinavia.

During the year of 2013 it was found that among people who booked artists for ten of the largest festivals only 12% were women, 88% male.</p><p style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">If we search online for equality in the music business and women on stage it's easy to find statements like, ""it's all about what’s out there,"" or ""it is difficult to find the female musicians"". We mean that such a statement is a matter of convenience, habit and laziness. In this way bookers and such disclaims any liability whatsoever for a job towards an equal music industry. Today there is no drought of female creators of music, yet it is still one of the most common arguments to not book equal. SheMusic has worked for over 20 years and have never experienced this problem that bookers or other music organizers too often complains about.</p><p style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">Making a quick research on reviews, headlines and articles in the music business where women are central, we can still see an excessive focus on their fashion choices, attitude and behaviour, than the actual music itself.

For us to succeed in this, it is required that bookers and music industry as a whole ensures that there is a substantial increase in female-dominated acts to music scenes, and that  this is taken as a matter of course from today.Today, musicians are not getting paid for preparation and rehearsal time. Big City Divas is seeking finance to provide musicians and artists with a rehearsal week.  One week where artists will be paid for the whole of their creative process. To do this we need your help and would love it if you would share our video and give a donation. Get involved in this summer's heaviest musical projects on, and spread the campaign!!If you work you should get paid, simple as det. Working as a musician for Big City Divas will be a full time job during the rehearsal week, for at least 5 days - 8 hours a day. We see it as a given that the musicians should get paid for their work and the whole of their creative process. Big City Divas is a project with a purpose, a goal and a vision. Musicians and artists take time away from their personal career because they see the importance of contributing to the common goal of equality in the music scene ... and because it's gonna be a hell turn on stage of course!WHY CONTRIBUTE?By contributing to Big City Divas rehearsal week you: 
make a statement for a gender equality on the music scenes.
contribute so that YOU can experience COMPLETELY amazing concerts this summer!
make possible, joint with Big City Divas, a project that will bring a big impact for female musicians and artists on the festival scenes in summer of 2014. 
make a continuous work possible. Because: the more rehearsal time we can give the musicians, the bigger pervasive beat on the scenes. This in turn produces a ripple effect in terms of real impact there and then. and also a bigger possibility to continue working with BCD for equality in the music scenes. We do not want to quit after this summer.
SHEMUSICSheMusic who is the organizer of the project Big City Divas is a non-profit organization that has been operating in Sweden for 20 years. Initially SheMusic organized various concert projects with only female musicians, this developed into a SheMusic-festival in the same spirit. In order to provide a scene which is represented by both men and women, SheMusic arranges concerts that vary from traditional line-ups, with a minimum of 50% (often 100%) women booked. SheMusic is joyous to announce it´s next initiative towards balance in the music business, Big City Divas!SheMusic manifest says: ”SheMusic want to stand as a beacon and be a constant source of inspiration for women's musicianship. SheMusic hopes to see the collaboration of various feminist approaches and perspectives; with the ultimate goal of gender equality in the music scene”.SheMusic have a large and active music network and has worked with artists such as; Robyn, Agnes, Neneh Cherry Sarah Dawn Finer, Jenny Wilson, Mapei, Titiyo, Linnea Henriksson and others. Saying that, Big City Divas does not expect any problems booking artists to the gigs this summer but we are not able to go out officially with all the names until festivals are booked and ready. We have to keep in mind that participating artists need to be able to keep a hold of their own tour plans and also book their gigs with Big City Divas.                                 REHEARSAL AND GIGSPreparations and rehearsal for the gigs are planned to begin with Big City Divas and artists getting together for a joint rehearsal week in early summer (which is why we are doing this campaign). Here they get to join in on a creative process to rearrange the artists songs for Big City Divas. The artists will thus play their own songs, for you to feel at home and stoked. The songs will then be reworked, made ​​bigger and thicker to fit in with a band in the size of Big City Divas!THE FUTURE FOR BCDAfter this summers gigs a goal is to find one or more additional gigs for Big City Divas in the autumn of 2014. The idea is to focus on areas which at a current state are male-dominated, such as christmas-shows, television programs etc. Big City Divas goal is to continue as a beacon for gender equality in the music business, even after the summer’s shows. This will either be made ​​possible through continuous reservations like above, or through collaborations with additional artists in Sweden and Scandinavia. The idea is to further develop and expand the concept so that Big City Divas can influence and inspire female musicianship outside of Sweden.IMPACT- MORE INFO AND BACKGROUNDToday only 15-20% female musicians are booked to festivals around Scandinavia. Unfortunately this has not improved much in recent years. In 2013, you could see that among 25 festivals 77% of the bands booked were dominated by men, only 19% of these were female-dominated, and 4% mixed.If we take a look at bookers and organizers of festivals, figures has not improved much in here neither. During the year of 2013 it was found that among people who booked artists for ten of the largest festivals only 12% were women, 88% male.If we search online for equality in the music business and women on stage it's easy to find statements like, ""it's all about what’s out there,"" or ""it is difficult to find the female musicians"". We mean that such a statement is a matter of convenience, habit and laziness. In this way bookers and such disclaims any liability whatsoever for a job towards an equal music industry. Today there is no drought of female creators of music, yet it is still one of the most common arguments to not book equal. SheMusic has worked for over 20 years and have never experienced this problem that bookers or other music organizers too often complains about.Making a quick research on reviews, headlines and articles in the music business where women are central, we can still see an excessive focus on their fashion choices, attitude and behaviour, than the actual music itself. Big City Divas and SheMusic are certain that in time it is possible to change those structures that maintain the fact that today's music scene is mostly made up of men.Big City Divas is a project wholly made by people who define themselves as a women. The change towards an equal music scene requires commitment from both bookers, artists, men and women. It is time to change, to advance the work for gender equality and provide clear feminist initiatives to all music scenes around the globe.Big City Divas will stand as beacon and a clear example that there is plenty of female mastery in the music business, and which long ago ought to have had it´s obvious place on the stages around the country.Best of regardsGudrun HauksdottirJeanette KarlströmKristin Olsson-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<p>We’re an independent electronic dance music label based in Atlanta and Birmingham, Al. We’ve been around now for three years and we’ve specialized in exposing new talent to the EDM market. We’ve had the honor of breaking several artists now who are beginning to gain respect in the larger scene. What we’re trying to do is launch even more. We’re not in it for the money, we’re in it for the love of music and to help others along the way.</p>
<h2><strong>What are we doing?</strong></h2>
<p>We’re trying to take the label to the next plateau so that we can continue to find and push new EDM acts into the larger market.</p>
<h2><strong>How will we do it and what’s the money for?</strong></h2>
<p>Over the years, it’s been a lot of blood, sweat and tears. That will still be the foundation of all that we do. What we’re going to do differently is focus more on the quality of our artist’s material and push it work harder to give them the press exposure that they need.</p>
<p>That’s where Indiegogo comes into play. We’re going to use the funds to provide our artist’s professional mastering services at <strong>no charge to them</strong> and to hire a publicist for the label who will focus on promoting our artists and their releases. These funds will cover all of our production expenses for the next 12 months. Each release can easily cost up to $600-800 apiece even in a digital format.</p>
<h2><strong>Why do we think we can do this?</strong></h2>
<p>We started the label in 2010 after realizing how difficult it is to break new talent into a market. A lot of this came from our own personal experience and frustrations. In the end, we realized that artists need an alley and typically record labels are not an artist’s alley. MK837 was set up from the start to not screw artists over. We offer our artists a large cut of our revenue and we also do everything possible to make sure they get paid. Beyond that, we cover expenses that most labels would simple charge back to their artists. We’ve been an alley now of over 40 different artists and we have every intention of continuing that tradition.</p>
<h2><strong>What success has MK837 had in the past?</strong></h2>
<p>Here’s a short list of accomplishments:</p>
<ol>
<li>We have had multiple tracks featured as “Must Hear” tracks on Beatport.com</li>
<li>We can say the same for our tracks on Traxsource and Satellite EDM as well.</li>

I've also put out a couple of solo projects. None have ever been as important as this one, though. With all the inspirations I've taken in over the years, I feel as if I'm giving back to those very same inspirations now. So many other wonderful artists and incredible sounds that are such a big part of my musical makeup.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This labor of love has been in the works for over three years now. I've spent countless hours tweaking lyrics and details, trying to get my feelings across as lovingly as I possibly can. This is truly my most personal work yet. It's so personal, in fact, that I want people to be able to hold it in their hands, and not just download it on their computer. I want people to feel the way that I did, when I was in high school and clutched my copy of ""This Is Gene Pitney,"" as I listened to sounds that I knew would change my life forever. The next question is, how do I do this? I've seen friends do fundraisers to support artistic projects like this, so I thought I'd give it a try, too. They say that timing is everything, and I feel like with this album, NOW really is the time. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The album is finished and mixed, but I'm still in need of funds to cover manufacturing of the compact discs and promotional items. Manufacturing is going to cost roughly $1000, and the promotional items another $200, so my total budget is $1200. As perks, most donors will get a copy of the new album, and extras like additional albums and promotional items.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tom Richards and I put so much love into this music, and I really believe we have a lot to offer. What we really need, though, is for everyone to support this project, by sharing on Facebook, sending out emails and telling everyone they know that new Lisa Mychols music in on the horizon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lastly, to all the Lisa Mychols fans out there, I created this for you and it is a creation of love. It is the only way I have to return to you, the love that you've shown me in the past. Along with the artists and sounds that have always inspired me, a much bigger inspiration has been the connection that we all have together. Please donate whatever you can, and help me release my album, ""Above, Beyond &amp; In Between.""</p>

<p>   Hello, I am CJ Clark and I am 19 years old. I am a musician. I have been playing the guitar since I was 10, singing and writing songs since I was 14, a little piano since I was 17, and have played many shows and performed with a band (The Delmore Schwartz) for 5 years. <br/>    I have been writing my own music for over 6 years now, but have never been fortunate enough to afford the equipment to properly record my songs. (I was using my ipod touch and its earbud-microphone to record my first song.)  <br/><br/>   I now want to record my first official solo album and put it out for everyone to hear.

Its gaily painted exterior attracted attention and drew people in. For 17 months, JR reconditioned and re-furbished guitars. During this period he donated in excess of 700 guitars and other related musical gear, and gave lessons to over 100 children. He hosted bands and jam sessions, took part in other community-related events, and put on fun events such as face-painting and modelling shoots for the children and youth that came to the shelter.

Teaching young people discipline and evaluating risk-taking


Developing a sense of achievement


Raising self-esteem

To facilitate these benefits, we:

March 12th, 2013, PeaceWalkers Jesse-Blue Forrest and Sandra Moon Dancer, in cooperation with the Gandhi King Foundation began retracing Gandhi’s steps. 
They will walk a total of 25 days raising awareness for the powerful relevance of Gandhi’s message of truth and non-violence today. Along the way, they will be meeting with women’s rights organizations, other peace activists and political figures as they raise awareness for the People's Campaign to Abolish the Draft and give space for women's voices.
 
As covered by The Times of India 'Global footfalls for Dandi anniversary'
 
Meet the PeaceWalkers

Jesse-Blue Forrest is the founding Director of the People’s Campaign to Abolish the Draft. He walks for the freedom to choose peace. His campaign has now taken him to India.
“This is a spiritual calling that was 17 years in the making. It took me many years to accept this call from the Spirit and to prepare my body and mind for this task. I am walking to inspire others to mobilize and to bring the calling to others.”
www.AbolishTheDraft.org
 
 
 

Sandra Moon Dancer is the founder and Executive Director of the Centre of Circle Wisdom in Toronto, Canada. She is an internationally renowned medicine woman, shaman, ceremonialist, energy teacher and inspirational speaker. 
""I am here to learn how to walk, in particular to walk for peace, peace for the people of this planet.""

Why is this Walk for Peace important?
In 1930 Gandhi walked the Salt March that shook the foundation of the British Empire through peaceful action and non-violence. It was a pivotal moment in the path to independence for India.
 

 
Now 83 years later, our great challenge and transformation is global. Jesse-Blue Forrest and Sandra Moon Dancer honour and continue Gandhi’s legacy at this powerful historic and spiritual moment by walking in non-violence for the freedom to choose peace.

<h3>Hi!</h3>
<p>My name is Adriana and I am a concert pianist. I love playing the piano, I started by the age of 5, in my transilvanian village. (yes, I am a Transilvanian girl :) ) </p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are 27 competitions that I won, a university that I graduated (the famous University of Music and performing Arts in Vienna) and a PhD that I am writing (about the beauty of music).</p>
<p>Due to the fact that I have the honor to take a master class in Luxembourg (July 14-25, 2013), I offer you the oportunity to join my class. </p>
<p>There, I can perfect my playing of French music: Maurice Ravel (the one who wrote the Bolero, but also wonderful piano pieces) and Francis Poulenc (the one who died exactly 50 years ago - in 1963 - and wrote an Hommage to the great French singer Edith Piaf). </p>
<p>The teacher Gabriel Tacchino was the last student of Francis Poulenc. This is my one chance to get all the little details from the first hand.</p>
<p>That is why I am kindly asking YOU for help. You can help me get this knowledge, which would help me play better, more beautifully. You would share this beauty because I am going to send you exclusive audio files from my next concert in Vienna (in October this year). Or maybe you come to the concert?</p>
<h3>What I need</h3>
<p>This is the list of how the money are to be needed:</p>
<p>320 € - airplane ticket, transport to and from the airports in Austria and Luxembourg</p>
<p>350 € - the participation fee at the master class</p>
<p>450 € - the price of the hotel (one place in a double room incl. breakfast, special price for the course participants, for 11 nights)</p>
<p>600 € - the price of eating in Luxembourg (one plate lunch and one plate evening; everything is pretty expensive there and I have no kitchen to cook for myself...)</p>
<p>150 € - indiegogo fees for this campaign</p>
<p><strong>Total: 1.770 €</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>For this money I get the one life oportunity to prepare my French repertoire with the last student of one of the most important French composer. In Vienna, I studied the Viennese classics; I also already have a big French repertoire (played the Ravel concerto with orchester etc). The participation at this master course would qualify me as an expert. The public - and you - will hear the special French flair and this absolutely beautiful music will have that special something, that you cannot describe. </p>
<p>This would bring a little more beauty to this world, because love combined with mastery cures heart and soul.</p>
<p>Every penny is important to me, every note of my playing will benefit from it.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The effect</h3>
<p>This is not my first master class, but no one treated the French music before.</p>
<p>As you can see on my website and in my bio, I play music with and for the people of this world. There were charity concerts for orphan children or for sick mothers, there were concerts for old people who couldn't go anymore to a concert hall, so we went to them and brought them music.</p>
<p>There is no way of expressing the feeling that you have, when you see the tears of an old, paralised man who cannot speak anymore and listens to your music. There is no way but music. </p>
<p>And you don't have to be other than healthy and happy to taste the sounds, to let go and fly with it. Music is beautiful. The theme of the 2.part of the Concerto in Sol of Maurice Ravel is one of the most beautiful pieces of music in the world. </p>
<p>Let you be a part of it, together with me; let's make music together and make this world more beautiful through it. </p>
<p>I have a Romanian blog, but on this occasion I am opening a special Luxembourg master class blog where I'm posting every day what I did and what I learned.</p>
<p>You will get <strong>exclusive audio files</strong> from the final concert in Luxembourg and also from my next concert in Vienna (October 2013), for your private music collection.</p>
<p>You can follow me online - you can also come live and meet me there and hear the music - that you helped rising.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>If you don't have 100 or 10 or 1 € for me, than please...</h3>
<p>... tell others about my piano course, maybe they have the money and need to invest them in something beautiful like music.</p>

<p class=""p1"">My name is Stephan Mathieu, I live as an independend full-time musician since 1989. I'm based in Saarbrücken, Germany and perform my music live worldwide. So far over 30 albums of my music were released internationally by some of the finest labels operating in the fields of electroacoustics, contemporary electronics and abstract digitalia.</p>
<p class=""p1""> </p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>What I do</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">The soundtrack for the video above is a remix I made in 2000 for the band <em>Yo La Tengo</em>, a little later Wired Magazine named me “<em>one of the most important laptop musicians of our time.</em>”</p>
<p class=""p1"">While I always wondered what a <em>laptop musician</em> might be (Are there ‘guitar musicians’? ‘Piano musicians’?), the computer remained <em>a crucial tool</em> for my work until today, when most of my music is created with acoustic instruments and obsolete media, such as mechanical-acoustic gramophones. </p>
<p class=""p1"">I'm using a laptop as a recording studio and musical instrument, as a research tool and as a home office to run my small business. I survive by living a modest life dedicated to my music. Most of my instruments are cheap, second hand finds, my studio consists of the laptop, an audio interface and a pair of (vintage, rather amazing) monitors. Nothing special really, I like to work on a low scale and to create with the tools I can afford.</p>

Justin Sinclair and Aaron Feeney became close friends primarily through a musical setting (church worship team), as well as at school and other events. Although they enjoyed much of life together, music was what seemed to hugely fuel their friendship. Being surrounded by Christian and pop-music culture, conversations about creative and unconventional chord progressions, classical compositions, and unique time signatures were inexplicably refreshing. Depth of lyric, as opposed to the shallow reptition of today's music, was a frequent topic as well. These conversations began to lay the foundation of what would become ""The Portion"". Later on a third member, Katherine Nixon, whose voice soothes the angels, was added onto several songs, completing the band. <br/><br/>""Crowds grew and grew after each show they played, leaving a trail of people pleading for recorded material. There was, unfortunately, none to give, other than a reference to an iPhone Facebook video. As they continued on to write and perform together they eventually received several different offers from various studios asking to record.

<p>Lots of cool stuff up for grabs!</p>
<p>Why are we asking for you to help? Because being an independent band has a lot of money going out, but not a lot coming in. We fund our own recordings, van hires, accommodation, fuel, time off our usual jobs (as a band at this level, we don't get paid much; if anything sometimes), we pay publicists, pay for our own marketing... the list really goes on and ADDS THE F*CK UP.</p>
<p>However, we don't stop funding it ourselves, but it has come to a point where some help would be rad. We are not asking for charity, we of course want to give back and see you get hooked up with some cool stuff, please check it all out and see if you are keen to jump on some stuff. </p>

כל סכום יעזור.

<p>It's 2013 and as part of my commitment to being a career songwriter, I want to join the NSAI.

NSAI stands for Nashville Songwriter's Association International, they are a 501 not-for-profit based in Nashville, TN. </p>
<p>Membership will provide some great opportunities to grow my craft of songwriting, including two one-on-one mentoring sessions a year, twelve professional song evaluations a year, invites to event workshops, and membership in the local NSAI 'Los Angeles' chapter. </p>

<h3><i>15 Years of Emery</i></h3>
<p>It's hard to believe how much we still love making music. Despite the years going by, it's never gotten old. Ever since we left our label 4 years ago, partnering with you all to release ""You Were Never Alone"" in 2015, we've felt the momentum building towards a rebirth of Emery.</p>
<p>Devin, Dave, Toby, Matt, and Josh - the team behind ""The Question"" - are all back and <i>fully</i> invested in what feels like a new chapter of our band, and we couldn't have gotten here without your help.</p>
<p><strong>We want to make our best album yet</strong>. We want to assemble an incredible production team. We want to spend a ton of time writing and arranging, like we used to. We're shooting for the stars, and you are the jet fuel we need to get there!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Here's a sample of ""So Cold I Can See My Breath"" from <i>Emery: Classics Reimagined EP, </i>a 3-song EP that will be delivered to every contributor within 24 hours of ordering from this campaign. </p>

</div><div>
<h3><i>What We Need &amp; What You Get</i></h3>
<p>We've estimated our basic costs again at $50,000, the same goal we had for <i>YWNA. </i>Of course, you guys crushed this goal last time. We pressed tons of expensive vinyl, paid for recording, mixing, mastering, travel, art, manufacturing, packing and shipping of all the products. After doing it once, we're better at it, and we think we can get an even a better record out faster with your help.</p>
<p>So feel free to pre-order the record &amp; exclusive merch in advance! In exchange, you'll get an <strong>exclusive immediate download of </strong><i><strong>Emery: Classics Reimagined EP (see video above)</strong>, </i>which includes FULLY re-arranged and re-imagined versions of <u><i>So Cold I Could See My Breath</i></u>, <u><i>The Smile, The Face</i></u> and <i><u>As Your Voice Fades</u></i>. This EP will <i>not</i> be available anywhere else, so we're excited to give it <i>exclusively</i> to our backers.</p>
<p>On top of this basic perk, we have incredible packages that will never be on sale anywhere else, exclusive vinyl limited to this campaign, and some fun limited experiences.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><i>Stretch Goals</i></h3>
</div><div>
<p>The impact of your early contribution is huge, as it all goes directly towards the production of new music, impacting the quality and success of this album. The ability for us to write together in a room, rent incredible recording spaces, and hire an incredible production team is all contingent on the amount of backers we have. The more of you that order the rewards, the more resources we have to put back into this record to make it our best. In order to incentivize contribution, we've attributed the number of backers to what we think will impact the quality of the record:</p>
<p><strong>1,000 BACKERS (UNLOCKED):</strong> The Best Production Team</p>
<p><strong>1,250 BACKERS (UNLOCKED):</strong> The Best Recording Studio &amp; Time Allotted</p>
<p><strong>1,500 BACKERS (UNLOCKED):</strong> The Best Publicist</p>
<p><strong>2,000 BACKERS (UNLOCKED):</strong> The Best Radio Team </p>
<p><strong>2,500 BACKERS (UNLOCKED):</strong> <strong><i>Emery: Classics Reimagined EP  </i>turns into a full-length LP of more of the ""classics"" released to all backers!</strong></p>
<p><strong>3,000 BACKERS (LOCKED): $7 Ticket ""Early Bird"" Discount to any of the regional US tours we will be planning in support of the record. We'll email you a discount code before each tour so you get first dibs AND a massive discount!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><i>Risks &amp; Challenges</i></h3>
<p>We have a relatively successful track record with delivering our albums this way. We've only done one crowd-fund so far for <i>You Were Never Alone, </i>and we learned a ton about how to make it more efficient and get deadlines in. Also, the label we own has facilitated a dozen of these things, and the team behind our fulfillment has become exceptional. </p>
<p>Because there can be errors in test pressings that need to be fixed, vinyl production can sometimes experience significant delays. We will do our best to get everyone their digital music TWO WEEKS BEFORE it's officially released - but sometimes vinyl packages can ship a little later than expected.</p>
<p>We plan on getting art and masters in early, well before we need them, in order to overcome some of these potential production delays.</p>
<p>Tours will be booked based on member schedule, and those can vary, but we do plan on hitting ALL regions of the US in support of this album. We want to be able to make sure we get to play for as many of you as possible.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><i>Other Ways You Can Help</i></h3>
<p>If you aren't in a spot to contribute to the production of this record, you can still help! The best way is by sharing this campaign via <strong>email and social media using the IndieGoGo Share Tools by the ""BACK IT"" button the top of the page!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong><i>The Collector Pack Wood Box</i></strong></h3>
<p>Here is a prototype of what the vinyl wood box will look like. This was handmade from walnut with wax (natural) coating. We are currently looking into burning the Emery logo into the side of the box with a branding iron, but we can't make any promises yet. Every box will be handmade, and thus unique, but each will fit into an Ikea Expedit (that square hole shelf everyone has for vinyl).</p>

</div><h3>FAQ</h3><p><strong>Q. How do I get the downloadable songs/albums?</strong></p><p>A.

The impact of your early contribution is huge, as it all goes directly towards the production of new music, impacting the quality and success of this album. The ability for us to write together in a room, rent incredible recording spaces, and hire an incredible production team is all contingent on the amount of backers we have. The more of you that order the rewards, the more resources we have to put back into this record to make it our best. In order to incentivize contribution, we've attributed the number of backers to what we think will impact the quality of the record:
1,000 BACKERS (UNLOCKED): The Best Production Team
1,250 BACKERS (UNLOCKED): The Best Recording Studio & Time Allotted
1,500 BACKERS (UNLOCKED): The Best Publicist
2,000 BACKERS (UNLOCKED): The Best Radio Team 
2,500 BACKERS (UNLOCKED): Emery: Classics Reimagined EP  turns into a full-length LP of more of the ""classics"" released to all backers!
3,000 BACKERS (LOCKED): $7 Ticket ""Early Bird"" Discount to any of the regional US tours we will be planning in support of the record. We'll email you a discount code before each tour so you get first dibs AND a massive discount!
 

Risks & Challenges
We have a relatively successful track record with delivering our albums this way. We've only done one crowd-fund so far for You Were Never Alone, and we learned a ton about how to make it more efficient and get deadlines in. Also, the label we own has facilitated a dozen of these things, and the team behind our fulfillment has become exceptional. 
Because there can be errors in test pressings that need to be fixed, vinyl production can sometimes experience significant delays. We will do our best to get everyone their digital music TWO WEEKS BEFORE it's officially released - but sometimes vinyl packages can ship a little later than expected.
We plan on getting art and masters in early, well before we need them, in order to overcome some of these potential production delays.
Tours will be booked based on member schedule, and those can vary, but we do plan on hitting ALL regions of the US in support of this album. We want to be able to make sure we get to play for as many of you as possible.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you aren't in a spot to contribute to the production of this record, you can still help! The best way is by sharing this campaign via email and social media using the IndieGoGo Share Tools by the ""BACK IT"" button the top of the page!
 
The Collector Pack Wood Box
Here is a prototype of what the vinyl wood box will look like. This was handmade from walnut with wax (natural) coating. We are currently looking into burning the Emery logo into the side of the box with a branding iron, but we can't make any promises yet. Every box will be handmade, and thus unique, but each will fit into an Ikea Expedit (that square hole shelf everyone has for vinyl).

<h3><strong>“Jeremy Walker may become the Duke Ellington of the early 21st century.” —<em>Jazz Ink</em></strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<h3>About Boot</h3>
<p>I'm Jeremy Walker - although many people just call me ""Boot."" When I was 32, after 24 years of playing the saxophone, I lost the instrument due to a yet-to-be-diagnosed neurological/autoimmune condition which limits my mobility and causes chronic pain. I turned to piano and composition, studying with David Berkman (Queens College, Tom Harrell), Frank Kimbrough (Juiliard) and other notables.</p>
<p>In my career, I am fortunate to have worked with musicians from Anthony Cox (Joe Lovano) and Wessell ""Warmdaddy"" Anderson (Wynton Marsalis) to Ted Nash (Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra) and Ron Miles (Bill Frisell). I have been commissioned by Jackson State University, North Dakota Jazz, and Bethel University, and have written over 70 compositions for my bands: Boot Camp, Small City Trio, Boxcar, and The Bootet. I have scored for film (Photographic Justice: The Corky Lee Story), collaborated with dance (Zenon Dance Company, TU Dance), and author a series of articles on culture for Walker Art Center and mnartists.org.</p>
<p>If for some reason you want to read more about me: <a href=""http://boot-music.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">boot-music.com</a></p>
<h3>Why 7 PSALMS?</h3>
<p>To me, the Psalms read like blues. They're full of humanity, of pain, and of hope. And I knew this would be a challenge. Writing this music has been a huge undertaking. 7 PSALMS is my first composition to include choir. Although I am a jazz musician, this work incorporates blues, country, folk and classical elements in one suite. This is the first time I have worked extensively with text/lyrics. I did not edit the verses. (I felt the music should bend to the text, not the other way around.) Writing the music for 7 PSALMS has been mentally exhausting and physically taxing - but exhilarating. And while 7 PSALMS has many ancestors, from Mozart to Duke Ellington, to John Coltrane and even Johnny Cash, I believe the work is singular.</p>
<p>For this project, I chose Psalms 3, 6, 13, 22, 126, 130 and 131.</p>
<h3>Why Fund 7 PSALMS?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>To support the free(!) kick-off concert</strong> April 13, 2013 at Bethel University in Saint Paul, Minnesota. To pay the band who has volunteered weeks of their time because they believe in this project. To provide, at the very least, a craft service (refreshments) table for our volunteer choir during dress rehearsal and performance.

About Boot
I'm Jeremy Walker - although many people just call me ""Boot."" When I was 32, after 24 years of playing the saxophone, I lost the instrument due to a yet-to-be-diagnosed neurological/autoimmune condition which limits my mobility and causes chronic pain. I turned to piano and composition, studying with David Berkman (Queens College, Tom Harrell), Frank Kimbrough (Juiliard) and other notables.
In my career, I am fortunate to have worked with musicians from Anthony Cox (Joe Lovano) and Wessell ""Warmdaddy"" Anderson (Wynton Marsalis) to Ted Nash (Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra) and Ron Miles (Bill Frisell). I have been commissioned by Jackson State University, North Dakota Jazz, and Bethel University, and have written over 70 compositions for my bands: Boot Camp, Small City Trio, Boxcar, and The Bootet. I have scored for film (Photographic Justice: The Corky Lee Story), collaborated with dance (Zenon Dance Company, TU Dance), and author a series of articles on culture for Walker Art Center and mnartists.org.
If for some reason you want to read more about me: boot-music.com
Why 7 PSALMS?
To me, the Psalms read like blues. They're full of humanity, of pain, and of hope. And I knew this would be a challenge. Writing this music has been a huge undertaking. 7 PSALMS is my first composition to include choir. Although I am a jazz musician, this work incorporates blues, country, folk and classical elements in one suite. This is the first time I have worked extensively with text/lyrics. I did not edit the verses. (I felt the music should bend to the text, not the other way around.) Writing the music for 7 PSALMS has been mentally exhausting and physically taxing - but exhilarating. And while 7 PSALMS has many ancestors, from Mozart to Duke Ellington, to John Coltrane and even Johnny Cash, I believe the work is singular.
For this project, I chose Psalms 3, 6, 13, 22, 126, 130 and 131.
Why Fund 7 PSALMS?


To support the free(!) kick-off concert April 13, 2013 at Bethel University in Saint Paul, Minnesota. To pay the band who has volunteered weeks of their time because they believe in this project. To provide, at the very least, a craft service (refreshments) table for our volunteer choir during dress rehearsal and performance. To pay for the publicity as we make as wide of an audience as possible aware of this new work. And to pay for some of my hours so I can, well, live.

To support future performances of 7 PSALMS. To ensure that this work reaches a lot of ears. My wife, Marsha, and I will take the audio and video from the debut performance, and contact churches, colleges, universities, and community venues to book two incarnations of 7 PSALMS 1) concerts for the ensemble--soloist, piano, saxophone, bass, and drums 2) concerts in which the ensemble will perform with choirs nationwide. (Community music-making!)

BONUS: To record 7 PSALMS. If we are wildly successful, and go over our goal by a substantial amount, we will record 7 PSALMS and release the music on CD.


What Do We Need? What Do You Get? 

The funds we raise will go directly to the dedicated people behind 7 PSALMS. (See above.)
If we don't reach our entire goal, the funds collected will go to the musical ensemble.
The perks range from a personal thank you, to an arrangement of a Psalm for your own choir, or even 7 PSALMS being performed at the venue of your choice. (See the perks section.)



What Does Your Giving Mean?

7 PSALMS is a special project, and it takes extra levels of commitment. Your support means 7 PSALMS can reach the broader public.   
I was recently told that I was not eligible for a grant because I was ""too established"" as an artist. I had a mixed reaction - it feels great to be recognized, and respected, but at the end of the day, it takes money to keep the work coming. This launch campaign allows us to get 7 PSALMS out to the people who want to hear it (and perform it).

<h3>Someday This War Is Going To End EP</h3>
<p>Kilgore is an American heavy metal band formed in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1991. The band is named after the character Kilgore Trout in the Kurt Vonnegut classic Breakfast of Champions and the Colonel Kilgore character from the movie Apocalypse Now. Kilgore released two albums, Blue Collar Solitude (1995) and A Search for Reason (1998).We landed a slot on the 1998 Ozzfest. They followed with a 1998 national tour with Slayer and Fear Factory and a 1998 European tour with Fear Factory and Spineshank. </p>
<p>We reunited for a few shows in 2007 and once again last year in 2016. However, this time we decided that the old Kilgore mojo was back and we should continue on as a band and release some new recordings and play some shows to support our release. Since we no longer have a recording contract or support of a major label, we need help from our fans to help us produce our first recording of original music since 1998!!</p>
<h3>The Songs</h3>
<p>When we first got together, we thought we would record a number of unreleased songs that our guitarist, Brian McKenzie had written for our second album ""A Search For Reason"". However, Brian came to us with four outstanding new songs that not only pay tribute to our early thrash metal roots... But sound just as Kilgore sounded in the late 90's. </p>
<p>So two songs from the new EP are songs written in 1996 for the ""A Search For Reason"" album that we never professionally recorded and four brand new brutal songs written in 2017.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Funding</h3>
<p>We've booked time at Power Station-New England in Waterford, CT. And we need to fund the recording sessions, mixing and mastering. Here's the breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>$4000.00 - Recording</li>
<li>$4000.00 - Mixing</li>
<li>$2000.00 - Mastering</li>
<li>$10,000.00 - Goal</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>Here’s where you come in. Every backer be a part of bringing the album to life—you benefit too. From drum heads, attending a recording session to an acoustic performance.... we have a perk for you. We want all of our fans to be a part of bringing this record to life!!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Release </h3>
<p>Tracking begins the week of Memorial Day and we'll have further overdub sessions to complete vocals. Mixing and mastering of the record will occur in July. Our plan is to release the album in October 2017.</p>

What's in it for you
While the expression of my gratitude may never be sufficient towards you for supporting this project, know that every donation made to this campaign is also part of the bigger picture of supporting artists and musicians give from their most authentic place and show that music matters!
Each perk includes something for you to keep in exchange for your generosity - either a physical or digital copy of the album (or both) as well as other things like house concerts, tickets to my launch party, an invitation to a recording session, and other surprises!Supporting local and independent musicians is important to ensure that good quality and authentic music continues to be created and that these traditions don't get squished under the machine of the commercial music industry.
Stories the land will tellThis project is a prayer for the land that holds and nourishes us everyday, and it is important not only as my own pursuit for what I believe I was made to do, but it is also my way of honouring the land and all the stories it has to tell. As I was writing these songs, each of them came to me from a very deep connection with the land. This is my way of giving back!   But what if.... I'll admit it, I worried that my campaign wouldn't be funded, that if I launched it and it didn't work out I'd have to swallow my pride and find another vocation, that the costs might be more than I anticipated or that something would go wrong with the recording process.I want you to know that I've thought about what could go wrong - and if you know me well you know that I like to think about that from every angle possible before going forward with a project.So if you're seeing this campaign today it's because I've thought about it for months as I designed it and felt that the risk was not only worthwhile, but that this is something I couldn't NOT do.

Some people aren't able to contribute with donations, but that doesn't mean you can't support this project!Here are some ways you can help me out:  Share this campaign link with friends on facebook, twitter, by email... and encourage music-lovers you know to support me!

<p>I am 20 years old, and am currently working in the Music Industry, building up my name. I lived in Philadelphia until just a few months ago, when I relocated to the Atlanta area to pursue my career as a recording artist. </p>
<p>I started developing as a singer after taking professional lessons at the age of ten, while also studying piano. In high school I performed in the Philadelphia All City Choir and performed for President Barack Obama, as well as been on stages with Paul Simon, Usher, Lawrence Brownlee, Terrance Howard, Renee Fleming, and James Earl Jones. </p>
<p>I have now been given the opportunity to take my singing career to a new level. Through this process and the connections I've made, I've begun working with producers Khari Simmons and Daz-I-Kue, who are interested in helping me produce some my music and take it to the next level. Khari Simmons and Daz-I-Kue had produced for artists such as India Arie, Anthony David, Whitney Houston, The Roots, John Legend, Sam Smith, and various UK Artists. I am set up to record an EP of three songs, which myself, my manager, and my producers consider to be hits. After I am finished recording, my producers plan to traffic my EP to independent record labels.

<p>Thanks for checking out our campaign. My name is Jim Donovan. I’m a musician, educator and a former founding member of the band Rusted Root (Send Me On My Way). </p>
<p>Over the past 28 years as a performer, I've learned that it is possible to have a great time AND do a lot of good. Successful artists, for better or worse, attract the attention of masses of people. This is a unique position where one can communicate important messages and mobilize people to take action. The Sun King Warriors regularly do both.</p>
<p><strong>Below you will learn about:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Who we are and why we are doing this campaign</li>
<li>Our message and mission</li>
<li>Who we actively support</li>
<li>What's in it for you</li>
<li>What we need</li>
<li>The impact of your support</li>
<li>Other ways you can help</li>
</ul>
<p>We're pleased to announce that after 12 months in the studio, the band – Kevin McDonald, Kent Tonkin, Bryan Fazio, Joe Marini, Dan Murphy, Harry Pepper and I are ready to unleash our new album <strong>""We See Through It""</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>

<div><strong>You Are My Everything.. Living Room Live Stream</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<p>If you are crazy for music with a message of truth wrapped in the big vintage rock sounds of Led Zeppelin, the emotion and melody stylings of Mumford &amp; Sons, soaring harmonies and tons of barreling tribal drums – then this might be your new favorite album. In addition to the band, we've got a whole crew of great friends and family who contributed to this disc including my children Tupelo, Ella and Oliver and my former Rusted Root band mates Jenn Wertz and Liz Berlin.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>This preorder campaign helps us to <strong>earn</strong> funds to market and release the album to the world via radio, publicity and social media. You can support us by ordering autographed merchandise, getting tickets to our big Pittsburgh release party, bringing us over to your house for an acoustic house party, becoming an angel or any of the other sweet perks to your right.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Music with a Message </span></h2>
<p><strong>""We See Through it"" celebrates the truth and all those who hold themselves to the highest standards. </strong>The music is dedicated to all who work every day to become better people... who refuse to be separated from their neighbors and families due to differing beliefs.. and who lend a hand to those in need.</p>
<p>The songs are an invitation to consider the idea that you and I are not separate. That our words, thoughts and actions have a real effect on the people around us... and that together we can do a lot of good.</p>
<p>The Sun King Warriors recognize that the connective power of music is a powerful point of commonality between people. Though our society is experiencing division, we know there is still common ground in music. Our aim to to provide a soundtrack that brings people together.</p>
<p>When you choose to back our project, you support a vision that stretches beyond selling CD's and t-shirts. You see, as a former member of a band who had modest success, I've already experienced and understand the illusion of fame and its trappings. But more importantly, I've also seen the incredible capacity for service that is possible when we use our success to help others.</p>

<h2>What We Need</h2>
<p>Traditionally, getting a new album into the hands of people who might love it required signing the rights and ownership of your music to a record company. Having experienced this first hand, I can tell you that the feeling of signing away the rights to meaningful personal creations is not good.</p>
<p>Sometimes, (like .001% of the time), a musician can earn money from the sales of their music... that is <strong>if</strong> you have a hit, What's much more common is that a record company fronts you money (an advance) and then charges you back for the cost of making the record.</p>
<p>More often than not, your sales don't even cover this advance and you're left in perpetual debt to the record company. This is because they pay you a royalty rate that equals roughly $1.32 per CD sold. In my old band, we divided that by 7, minus 20% commissions to our management, minus taxes... you get the idea.</p>
<p>That's not happening on this record.</p>
<p>This is an completely independent and self-financed project. Hundreds of hours and tens of thousands of dollars of gig and personal money has already been invested into this recording. When it comes to making music, we do it right and we don't cut corners. We've got serious skin in the game and believe in the music and the message. Our mode of operation is to enter these works of art without fear. </p>
<p>Now that we have what we feel is a magnificent work of art, we come directly to people like you and just lay out what we need with complete transparency. We do this so you can actually see what goes into making high quality music and how you can be a key part of spreading our music and message worldwide.</p>

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>In 2015, I used Indiegogo for my first album titled 'Sun King Warriors"". The incredible support offered by people like you helped me to secure wide radio play throughout North America where the music landed for several months on Billboard’s Americana chart. The song Olalala reached #1 on two stations for multiple weeks, landed at Top 5 on 13 stations and Top 20 on 22 stations. The last campaign also helped us land national press in publications such as Relix Magazine and the Washington Times. In sum,  grassroots support of people like you gave the band the boost it needed to get off the ground and begin playing regionally throughout the Mid-Atlantic region.</p>
<p>I've been releasing and promoting music since 1990. Our experience and track record gives us complete confidence that we will deliver any and every perk you invest in. Our reputation is our most valuable asset and we would do nothing to taint it. The album is at the duplication plant as we speak. We anticipate delivery of many boxes of CDs to Jims house by early April 2018. Our plan is to get them out to you by April 15, 2018 or sooner.</p>

</div></div>","Thanks for checking out our campaign. My name is Jim Donovan. I’m a musician, educator and a former founding member of the band Rusted Root (Send Me On My Way). 
Over the past 28 years as a performer, I've learned that it is possible to have a great time AND do a lot of good. Successful artists, for better or worse, attract the attention of masses of people. This is a unique position where one can communicate important messages and mobilize people to take action. The Sun King Warriors regularly do both.
Below you will learn about:

Who we are and why we are doing this campaign
Our message and mission
Who we actively support
What's in it for you
What we need
The impact of your support
Other ways you can help

We're pleased to announce that after 12 months in the studio, the band – Kevin McDonald, Kent Tonkin, Bryan Fazio, Joe Marini, Dan Murphy, Harry Pepper and I are ready to unleash our new album ""We See Through It"".
 

You Are My Everything.. Living Room Live Stream
 
If you are crazy for music with a message of truth wrapped in the big vintage rock sounds of Led Zeppelin, the emotion and melody stylings of Mumford & Sons, soaring harmonies and tons of barreling tribal drums – then this might be your new favorite album. In addition to the band, we've got a whole crew of great friends and family who contributed to this disc including my children Tupelo, Ella and Oliver and my former Rusted Root band mates Jenn Wertz and Liz Berlin.
 
Isn't it beautiful?

 
This preorder campaign helps us to earn funds to market and release the album to the world via radio, publicity and social media. You can support us by ordering autographed merchandise, getting tickets to our big Pittsburgh release party, bringing us over to your house for an acoustic house party, becoming an angel or any of the other sweet perks to your right.
 
Music with a Message 
""We See Through it"" celebrates the truth and all those who hold themselves to the highest standards. The music is dedicated to all who work every day to become better people... who refuse to be separated from their neighbors and families due to differing beliefs.. and who lend a hand to those in need.
The songs are an invitation to consider the idea that you and I are not separate. That our words, thoughts and actions have a real effect on the people around us... and that together we can do a lot of good.
The Sun King Warriors recognize that the connective power of music is a powerful point of commonality between people. Though our society is experiencing division, we know there is still common ground in music. Our aim to to provide a soundtrack that brings people together.
When you choose to back our project, you support a vision that stretches beyond selling CD's and t-shirts. You see, as a former member of a band who had modest success, I've already experienced and understand the illusion of fame and its trappings. But more importantly, I've also seen the incredible capacity for service that is possible when we use our success to help others.

Music with a Mission
The mission of the Sun King Warriors is to harness the energy and attention generated by our music and direct it toward organizations who are helping to raise consciousness and who provide service to the greater good.

Utilizing media via radio & news interviews to spread the word about our mission


 
Action So Far

Band Together Pittsburgh- A non-profit who provides music based educational programming for people with Autism.

Greater Pittsburgh Food Bank- Serving hungry families and children throughout the Pittsburgh region.
