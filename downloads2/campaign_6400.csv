<p><strong>Hello everyone! </strong></p>
<p>Thank-you for visiting my campaign page. I am looking to raise some funds to help towards the cost of having my first solo art exhibition in the autumn.<br/>If you know me and my previous work you’ll be aware that I am usually more craft based, however, 2020 being the strange year that it was, it freed up some time to work on some new things.</p>
<p> At the time  I was living on the edge of Thetford forest and got really interested in the Breckland landscape I was so close to. I did lots of walking, photographing and just generally letting myself go a bit wild. By the summer it was very clear a theme was emerging in the things I was creating and a natural body of work was building. ‘Anima’ is the result of that exploratory year.</p>
<p>'Anima' is a mixed media show encorporating wooden, ceramic and textile sculpture as well as photography, paintings and other experimental mediums such as chalk, bronze and bark. The works I have made are joyful and full of wonder, playful and fun. I am having the exhibition  in celebration of these things, as well as to raise awareness of the Breckland landscape and why it is so special. Although much has been lost to large fields and pine trees, so much of what remains is still accessible; I want to encourage people to have their own adventures and find the magic in the world around them.</p>
<p>My goal amount means that it will be a well put together and quality experience for everyone to visit and remember!</p>

<h3>Tree of Love</h3>
<p>The Tree of Love is an art installation, intended to be a sacred space, a place of gathering, of celebration, of rest. An oasis of calm and human contact in what can be a whirlwind of impressions and high-energy intensity of the Nowhere event. A sanctuary for contemplation. An ‘event space’ for spiritual workshops, weddings, celebrations, or commemorations. A sculpture that can be experienced for its aesthetic beauty, and at the same time is a “canvas of experience” for participants to use in a way they see fit, different from the standard communal structures or barrios.</p>
<p>Trees have had a special function in past and present human societies. They were and are places of worship. Of connectedness to nature. Of shade, that enables group gatherings. Of teaching. Of repose.</p>
<p>The Tree of Love celebrates this archetypical function of trees, by bringing a large tree sculpture, made out of natural “local” Spanish materials, that enables all above functions, and at the same time reflects in its design and execution on the necessity of high budgets, and of using “new” and environmentally less friendly materials.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556907707/gmcvq4tijy2gnvqc7rzg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>For construction of the Tree of Love, the following items are part of our budget:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transportation/Logistics:  € 400</li>
<li>Construction hardware:  € 300</li>
<li>Rope and wire:  € 300</li>
<li>Tools and add-ons:  € 200</li>
<li>Lighting and cables:  € 300</li>
<li>Sarinena pre-build rentals:  € 250</li>
<li>Fundraising costs:  € 200</li>
<li>Perks:  € 200</li>
<li>Buffer:  € 250 </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Total budget: € 2400</strong></p>
<p>The Nowhere Art Team is in the process of granting the Tree of Love generous support. At this point, it is not fully clear yet for what amount they can assist us, but a grant request of at least 1200 has been made. We ask your generous help as well, in raising our total budget and getting the Tree of Love out to Nowhere in its ideal form. </p>
<p>If we don't raise our budget, the tree will be scaled down in size and refinement. In the case we raise more than our crowdfunding effort, the surplus money will go to further enhance the tree, up to a point where we will gift the additional funds to the Nowhere organization, to help fund other artworks.</p>
<p>In any case, there will be a Tree of Love at Nowhere this year!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>We are very grateful for each and every donation, big or small. Your biggest perk will be the knowledge that you have helped to enable meaningful experiences at the Tree of Love.</p>
<p>Depending on your contribution, we have devised the following perks:</p>
<ul>
<li>for a € 5 donation, you get a hug or high-five from as many team members of the Tree of Love as you can find at the moment of collection. All consensual, of course.</li>
<li>for a € 10 donation, you get a hug or high-five, and you will receive a special Tree of Love pendant.</li>
<li>for a € 25 donation, you get a hug or high-five, receive a pendant, and get a special Tree of Love t-shirt.</li>
<li>for a € 100 donation, you get a hug or high-five, receive a pendant, get a t-shirt, and become the owner of a special Tree of Love miniature sculpture.</li>
</ul>

<p>Apart from helping us with a donation, we kindly invite all that want to help out with their time and effort in helping to create the Tree of Love, by reaching out to us.

</div></div>","Tree of Love
The Tree of Love is an art installation, intended to be a sacred space, a place of gathering, of celebration, of rest. An oasis of calm and human contact in what can be a whirlwind of impressions and high-energy intensity of the Nowhere event. A sanctuary for contemplation. An ‘event space’ for spiritual workshops, weddings, celebrations, or commemorations. A sculpture that can be experienced for its aesthetic beauty, and at the same time is a “canvas of experience” for participants to use in a way they see fit, different from the standard communal structures or barrios.
Trees have had a special function in past and present human societies. They were and are places of worship. Of connectedness to nature. Of shade, that enables group gatherings. Of teaching. Of repose.
The Tree of Love celebrates this archetypical function of trees, by bringing a large tree sculpture, made out of natural “local” Spanish materials, that enables all above functions, and at the same time reflects in its design and execution on the necessity of high budgets, and of using “new” and environmentally less friendly materials.
 


 
What We Need
For construction of the Tree of Love, the following items are part of our budget:

Transportation/Logistics:  € 400
Construction hardware:  € 300
Rope and wire:  € 300
Tools and add-ons:  € 200
Lighting and cables:  € 300
Sarinena pre-build rentals:  € 250
Fundraising costs:  € 200
Perks:  € 200
Buffer:  € 250 

Total budget: € 2400
The Nowhere Art Team is in the process of granting the Tree of Love generous support. At this point, it is not fully clear yet for what amount they can assist us, but a grant request of at least 1200 has been made. We ask your generous help as well, in raising our total budget and getting the Tree of Love out to Nowhere in its ideal form. 
If we don't raise our budget, the tree will be scaled down in size and refinement. In the case we raise more than our crowdfunding effort, the surplus money will go to further enhance the tree, up to a point where we will gift the additional funds to the Nowhere organization, to help fund other artworks.
In any case, there will be a Tree of Love at Nowhere this year!
 
What You Get
We are very grateful for each and every donation, big or small. Your biggest perk will be the knowledge that you have helped to enable meaningful experiences at the Tree of Love.
Depending on your contribution, we have devised the following perks:

for a € 5 donation, you get a hug or high-five from as many team members of the Tree of Love as you can find at the moment of collection. All consensual, of course.
for a € 10 donation, you get a hug or high-five, and you will receive a special Tree of Love pendant.
for a € 25 donation, you get a hug or high-five, receive a pendant, and get a special Tree of Love t-shirt.
for a € 100 donation, you get a hug or high-five, receive a pendant, get a t-shirt, and become the owner of a special Tree of Love miniature sculpture.


 

 
A word about temples
The team that brings you the Tree of Love, has brought temples to the Nowhere event in the past. This year, we explicitly do not make a claim for this installation to be a ""Burning Man style temple"" for the Nowhere event. 
Why? Because past is prologue. We grow. We evolve. 
The Tree of Love is a ""sacred space"", but does not have pre-described rituals, it does not have the expectation that people come and mourn their deceased beloved, it does not aim for people to ""let go"".
The Tree of Love is a place for people to share their humanity. To share their souls. To share their love. A place of ""worship"" in the oldest form: a tree, our sacred ancestors in evolution, that shade us and comfort us on our desert adventures. Some rocks of the Monegros under it, that invite for play, or for ritual, but do not enforce it.
 

Risks & Challenges
The sculpture/structure will be built by a team that has successfully, without safety incidents, created large-scale sculptures and installations at (burn) events previously. Among those installations were the Temples of Dissolution, Ascension, and Reflection, at Nowhere. Also, recently members of the team built a sculpture with the same materials, of comparable dimensions, that was sturdy, safe, and was eventually burned without incidents.

<p><strong>OPUS</strong> is a both an art piece and a <i>playable instrument</i>. Inspired by the surrealist quality of the playa, it takes the form of an abstracted piano, a continuous surface of keys, with different sound stations to be activated and played by visitors.

<h3><strong>Design and Interactivity </strong></h3>
<p><strong>OPUS </strong>is <i>immersive, interactive, and it glows</i>! </p>
<p>Musical instruments can be intimidating.  A primary goal of <strong>OPUS </strong>is to lower the barrier to artistic creation and to allow everyone the opportunity to produce creative works.  In pursuit of this goal, we've designed a keyboard you're unlikely to find on another instrument.  The black keys that you might find on a traditional piano have been removed, and the keys have been programmed to ensure ""wrong"" notes are hard to find and to facilitate harmony between multiple players performing different roles in the ad-hoc ensemble.  Through these reconfigurations, we hope that everyone -- no matter how many music lessons you may have had in the past -- can produce joyful multi-sensory works of art.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560223676/hcsxkh02hvpgnwgzr90s.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>To futher encourage collaborative exploration, rather than solo performance, this piece offers multiple operable stations with a <i>wide variety of sound designs</i>. There are ten positions along the continuous key surface where people can interact with the piece: this includes horizontal and vertical spans of keys, and keys that widen into hand and foot pads. Each station will offer the players a unique role in the ensemble, as synths, subs, atmospheric pads, and percussion.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560141392/bfij5eo2yfkfoz4hh6xv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Interacting with each station generate beams of light that chase along a corresponding collection of tubes.  Quick key presses will produce small beads of light while holding a key will fill the tube. As people interact with <strong>OPUS</strong>, they will generate complementary sound and light, and as more people join in, the layers of sound and the animation of lights will become increasingly complex.  One person might only be able to generate a spark of simulated fire; however, several players could set the piece fully ablaze.  The full range of the audio-visual programming can only be unlocked and discovered through the coordinated efforts of several players.  <i>We will be incorporating a few interaction easter eggs for you to find :)</i></p>

Have you ever seen an artwork and wondered about the person who made it? How much time and effort it took to create?

It is run entirely by practicing artists who hold down other jobs in the hospitality industry, and seeks to create a unique and unexpected dining experience. The artists will not only be running the restaurant but have created exclusive artworks for the event that will be incorporated into the dining service in surprising and fun ways. Artists' Spread seeks to not only open up questions around the sustainability of artistic careers and the financial vulnerability of artists, but to provide potential answers and solutions.</p><p>For some fantastic grub and a one-of-a-kind art experience both delicious and thought-provoking, the one-night-only opening on Sunday 12th August at Glasgow’s Project Café is not to be missed.</p><p>However, the project needs a little help to get things off the ground!</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Whad’ya need?</strong></p><p>There will be 50 tickets available for the one-night-only event with each guest attending being provided with:</p><ul>

As many artists struggle to keep their practice going while juggling other employment and cuts continue to be made across the arts, this part is incredibly important. A recent survey conducted by the Scottish Artists’ Union<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[1]</a> in 2017 for their membership base of artists revealed that 81% of respondents earn less than £10000 per year from their art practice.  In addition, 73% of their respondents have never received public funding.</p><p>Your funding is crucial in making this project a success.

I'm working as an associate professor at <a href=""https://www.geidai.ac.jp/english/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tokyo University of the Arts</a> and also releasing various works as a <a href=""https://6mirai.tokyo-midtown.com/en/creator/hachiya_kazuhiko/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">media artist</a>. For the last 16 years, I have been working on the OpenSky Project, creating and flying a small single-seater jet-powered airplane called M-02J. The motif of it is ""Mehve"" that many people want to ride like Nausicaa in Japanese comic/animated film ""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind.""</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Our Airplane, M-02J</strong></h3><p>The OpenSky Project requires to create an airplane what people could actually ride and fly, so from the beginning, I asked a professional to work with. Our airplane has been designing and manufacturing by professional plane production company <a href=""https://www.ac-olympos.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Aircraft OLYMPOS</a>, year by year, step by step, and the first flight in 2013, then in 2016 a flight in a circuit traffic pattern has been achieved. At first, it was thought that ""it's impossible,"" but we improved the airplane's impeccable creation by step-by-step process and repeated the test flight while helping many people, and reached this by 2017. </p><div>
<div>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/JAobfMSX9dg?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>From 2013 to 2018, we conducted some test flights in Japan, and now, we are enthusiastic that we will achieve our much-awaited and the last mission of this project ""exhibit and fly our airplane M-02J in the US sky."" At this year's opportunity, we are going to:</p>
</div>
<p>1) participate in the home of aviation EAA AirVenture OSHKOSH in the US, <br/>2) set after-talk session in LA, <br/>3) exhibit at Chino Airport, and <br/>4) run a test flight at Corona Airport.</p>
<p>In addition to these, so that we could carry out the plans in California, we need an extra budget for airplane transportation, and the venue will be searched and decided from now on.</p>
</div><p>""Show M-02J the people in the US"" is this project's ultimate goal. I want to make this happen, make it real. Please help our grand project!</p><p> </p><h3><strong>What is EAA AirVenture OSHKOSH?</strong></h3><p>First of all, please take a look at this video. </p><div><div>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/NdXHKkNMGes?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p><br/>Isn't it amazing? </p>
</div></div><p>I went to the Oshkosh Air Show for the first time as a preliminary inspection in 2017. So, wow, I was overwhelmed by the scale (the venue is enormous, events every day for a week, etc.), types and quantities of aircraft, and the passion and spirit of the people participating in this event. Unlike the ordinary air shows (trade shows style of ones) , the Oshkosh Air Show is based on ""civil aviation aircraft."" It is the world's largest air show that is still profoundly ingrained the early era of civil aviation aircraft culture which is ""make your own and fly,"" and it is the sacred place where aircraft lovers all over the United States gather!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560249301/oqz9mgzbzxnpljyahdnn.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>And, The Oshkosh Air Show will have 600,000 visitors and 10,000 aircraft during the seven days. This air show is not only for plane enthusiasts but also for a wide range of people from aviation workers to researchers, enthusiasts, ordinary people, and families. So, I think to show M-02J in the Oshkosh Air Show is an enormous opportunity to show ""the actual flying plane created by the artist.”</p><h3>
<br/><strong>The Artist Creates An Airplane</strong>
</h3><p>The animation movie ""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind"" was released in Japan in 1984; 35 years ago for now.</p><div>

<p> </p>
</div><p>At that time, I was a high school student, and of course, I went to the theater! I remember I was very moved and brought back the impression home. Well, I did not think that I could make a plane similar to the Mehve 30 years after that …</p><p>The anime movie director Hayao Miyazaki has been drafted the Mehve as a ""non-flying airplane."" Since that, a decade later, I became an artist using technology and started to create works using micro-jet engines. At the beginning of 2000, I thought about if the power output of the jet engine continues to be improved, it would be possible to fly a small, single-seater airplane by about 2010. ""Could I really make Mehve seen in a movie when I was a high school student?"" After being obsessed with the delusion, I began to make an airplane as an artwork “to make the impossible possible.”</p><p>I made some models in 2003, made a glider with professionals to make sure that an ordinary human can drive, trained on an ultralight plane, and made a successful maiden flight in 2013. In 2016, I made traffic flight at an altitude of 300 feet.</p><p>It took a long time and a lot of money than I expected for the beginning, but ""the closest to Mehve among the airplanes that exist in the world"" could be realized. I made it so much that I want to show everyone in the US that our aircraft is flying!</p><p><strong> </strong></p><h3><strong>OpenSky US Tour Schedule</strong></h3><p> Here is the current planning schedule:</p><p><strong>July 22 to 28</strong>: Exhibit actual airplane and explain the project at ""Homebuilder's Hangar"" in EAA AirVenture OSHKOSH.

</ul><p> </p></div>","Hello, I'm Kazuhiko Hachiya. I'm working as an associate professor at Tokyo University of the Arts and also releasing various works as a media artist. For the last 16 years, I have been working on the OpenSky Project, creating and flying a small single-seater jet-powered airplane called M-02J. The motif of it is ""Mehve"" that many people want to ride like Nausicaa in Japanese comic/animated film ""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind."" Our Airplane, M-02JThe OpenSky Project requires to create an airplane what people could actually ride and fly, so from the beginning, I asked a professional to work with. Our airplane has been designing and manufacturing by professional plane production company Aircraft OLYMPOS, year by year, step by step, and the first flight in 2013, then in 2016 a flight in a circuit traffic pattern has been achieved. At first, it was thought that ""it's impossible,"" but we improved the airplane's impeccable creation by step-by-step process and repeated the test flight while helping many people, and reached this by 2017. 


From 2013 to 2018, we conducted some test flights in Japan, and now, we are enthusiastic that we will achieve our much-awaited and the last mission of this project ""exhibit and fly our airplane M-02J in the US sky."" At this year's opportunity, we are going to:

1) participate in the home of aviation EAA AirVenture OSHKOSH in the US, 2) set after-talk session in LA, 3) exhibit at Chino Airport, and 4) run a test flight at Corona Airport.
In addition to these, so that we could carry out the plans in California, we need an extra budget for airplane transportation, and the venue will be searched and decided from now on.
""Show M-02J the people in the US"" is this project's ultimate goal. I want to make this happen, make it real. Please help our grand project! What is EAA AirVenture OSHKOSH?First of all, please take a look at this video. 

Isn't it amazing? 
I went to the Oshkosh Air Show for the first time as a preliminary inspection in 2017. So, wow, I was overwhelmed by the scale (the venue is enormous, events every day for a week, etc.), types and quantities of aircraft, and the passion and spirit of the people participating in this event. Unlike the ordinary air shows (trade shows style of ones) , the Oshkosh Air Show is based on ""civil aviation aircraft."" It is the world's largest air show that is still profoundly ingrained the early era of civil aviation aircraft culture which is ""make your own and fly,"" and it is the sacred place where aircraft lovers all over the United States gather!And, The Oshkosh Air Show will have 600,000 visitors and 10,000 aircraft during the seven days. This air show is not only for plane enthusiasts but also for a wide range of people from aviation workers to researchers, enthusiasts, ordinary people, and families. So, I think to show M-02J in the Oshkosh Air Show is an enormous opportunity to show ""the actual flying plane created by the artist.”
The Artist Creates An Airplane
The animation movie ""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind"" was released in Japan in 1984; 35 years ago for now.

 
At that time, I was a high school student, and of course, I went to the theater! I remember I was very moved and brought back the impression home. Well, I did not think that I could make a plane similar to the Mehve 30 years after that …The anime movie director Hayao Miyazaki has been drafted the Mehve as a ""non-flying airplane."" Since that, a decade later, I became an artist using technology and started to create works using micro-jet engines. At the beginning of 2000, I thought about if the power output of the jet engine continues to be improved, it would be possible to fly a small, single-seater airplane by about 2010. ""Could I really make Mehve seen in a movie when I was a high school student?"" After being obsessed with the delusion, I began to make an airplane as an artwork “to make the impossible possible.”I made some models in 2003, made a glider with professionals to make sure that an ordinary human can drive, trained on an ultralight plane, and made a successful maiden flight in 2013. In 2016, I made traffic flight at an altitude of 300 feet.It took a long time and a lot of money than I expected for the beginning, but ""the closest to Mehve among the airplanes that exist in the world"" could be realized. I made it so much that I want to show everyone in the US that our aircraft is flying! OpenSky US Tour Schedule Here is the current planning schedule:July 22 to 28: Exhibit actual airplane and explain the project at ""Homebuilder's Hangar"" in EAA AirVenture OSHKOSH. We are currently working toward to hold whether the demo flight is possible.Late July to early August: Test flight at Waupaca Municipal Airport in Wisconsin. (It will be a closed test. We will let only backers know the dates and times.)After EAA AirVenture OSHKOSH, I would like to ship the airplane to California by land, then I would like to hold lectures, fan meetings, the exhibition of the airplane, and demo flights. August 9 and 10: Presentation of the project and EAA AirVenture OSHKOSH 2019 in Los Angeles. AUGUST 9  Event Open 20:30  Anime Jungle LA  319 East 2nd Street #103, LA, CA, 9001220:30〜22:00 (Admission 10USD)Flying to US skies, Möwe from Nausicaä arrives Special Talk ShowSpecial Guest: Ayako Fujitanievent page The backer of ""Event Invitation Pack""  or above will be invited free of charge.AUGUST 10 Program Starts 14:00 The Japan Foundation LA5700 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 100, LA, CA 9003614:00~ (Admission Free)Make It Real: Flying Out of Miyazaki Animation--OpenSky US Tour 2019 Summer--event pageThe backer of ""Fan Meeting Pack"" will be Invited to the fan meeting in LA (after Seminar at Japan Faundation LA)! August 15 to 18: Display of the airplane and introduction lecture of the project on the hangar of Chino Airport.

Again, fly M-02J, this time in the US sky!!!  (Gamme Takiguchi )  Risks & ChallengesCurrently, our airplane is in transit by ship. We are considering that there is a risk of delays in customs clearance in the US customs inspection, etc., but it is assumed that the possibility of not being in time for the exhibition is low because there is enough transportation schedule to offset the risk. Also, there is a possibility that an accident or damage may occur during container (M-02J is in it) transportation, but we think that it is unlikely to happen.About flight testing, our airplane belongs to the Ultralight category in the US Aviation Act, that means in principle it can be flown in the US sky as a ""Federal Aviation Regulation Part 103-Ultralight Vehicles"" without FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) permission. To make it sure, we are asking the FAA about it while getting the cooperation of EAA.In any case, flight tests should only be performed in a safe environment and suitable weather, with utmost care to avoid accidents. At last...Thank you for reading through to the end. I would like to get your help, make the US tour a success, and let more people see M-02J...!!!

<h3>Know Your Crazy</h3>
<p>Know Your Crazy is an art book made for women, by women. It features mixed media art created by Vivienne Boucherat, a visual artist and musician from London, and was brought to life by Cindy daSilva, an artist manager out of New Jersey, and Rene Harbison, who heads up a production and consulting firm in Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>We all have our own ‘crazy’, and we each internalize in our own way.  We’ve made art come to life using Vivienne’s own little heady, mad women and we have presented it hopefully in a way that each one of you can relate to. Our intent was to make ‘crazy’ less crazy. We hope you’ll share with your friends and that you’ll have some fun, share a few laughs and perhaps shed a couple of tears, but most importantly know you are not alone. For all of our differences, we are all very much the same. </p>
<p>We decided to crowdfund Know Your Crazy so that numerous women could be a part of our project! By backing our project, you will have the opportunity to experience some, if not all of these wonderful perks!</p>
<ul><li>
<p>We are recreating the 1972 Rock anthem ""Hold Your Head Up"", originally by Argent, to serve as the soundtrack for our project.  You can be featured in our women’s movement recording and/or video for “Hold Your Head Up - (Almost) A cappella Version.""  <strong>(Diamond and Platinum tiers only)</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Did you know the lyrics are actually ""Hold your head up, woman""? We didn't think so ? But Vivienne knows because she is married to the songwriter!  Her husband Chris White was the original bass player for 1960s British Invasion legends, The Zombies, and has countless credits to his name as a songwriter and producer, including the beloved Zombies classic ""This Will Be Our Year"" (heard in pivotal emotional scenes on TV shows like ""Schitt's Creek"", ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"" and ""Mad Men"").  Chris wrote ""Hold Your Head Up"" for and about women, which is why he's disappointed so many fans misquote the lyrics.  Our (Almost) A cappella Version will set the record straight!</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Audio - A clip of your vocals (at least 10 seconds) which will be recorded in a professional recording studio (limit to 30 minutes at the studio) will be included on our “Hold Your Head Up - Almost A Cappella Version.” Get dressed up, go to a professional recording studio, where a talented engineer/producer will help you sound your best! You'll also have a one-on-one Zoom chat with Viv beforehand to go over the available parts. She will help you pick out what works best for your voice, and prepare you for your session!</p></li>
<li><p>Video - Sing, dance, hold up a sign that says WOMAN! Those are just a few of the things you can do within our ""Hold Your Head Up - Almost A cappella Version"" video that will be on YouTube for all the world to see! Be a part of our women's movement and get ready for your closeup! ?</p></li>

<h3>What</h3>
<p>The ArtWalk is an independent project to promote art, environmental awareness and community on the Garden Route.</p>
<p>The Artwalk consists of 10 large outdoor sculptural installations, made from recycled waste materials, that visitors and locals can enjoy viewing in the gardens of timberlake. The installations are made by local communities under the guidance of local artists.</p>
<p><strong>Art + Environment + Community = ArtWalk</strong></p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The ArtWalk is the natural progression of the community and environmental experience of timberlake and the community World Cup decor project on Thesen Island, managed by Artwalk co-ordinators Melissa Daitz and Bruce Adams. </p>
<p>The Garden Route relies on tourism for its livelihood, but is the natural beauty of the Garden Route being used sustainably and is tourism uplifting all communities? Local community projects exist in the towns of George, Sedgefield, and Knysna with most producing arts and crafts in an attempt to sustain their important activities. Yet many of these projects remain unknown and receive little support. The ArtWalk aims to change this.</p>
<h3>Why</h3>
<p>Your contribution to the ArtWalk project will help the Garden Route come together to create around Art and the Environment, and help community projects and local artists gain exposure and increase their earnings potential.</p>
<p>The ArtWalk builds a hub that brings different people together, creates something beautiful from waste, showcases local creativity, highlights environmental challenges and provides much needed involvement and exposure for local artists and community projects.</p>
<p>Each sculpture spotlights an environmental challange...<strong>Stimulating conversation and education about the Environment.</strong></p>
<p>Installations and components are made by local communities under the guidance of local artists... <strong>Developing Art and design on the Garden Route.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are a visitor or plan to visit the Garden Route, this is your opportunity to give back in a creative way.</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Installations</h3>
<p>We have raised funds for the first four outdoor sculptures and we are appealing for assistance to raise sponsorships and donations for the remaining six installations to realize the vision of the ArtWalk...</p>
<p>5. PLASTIC IN THE SEA - Drawing the viewers attention to the amount of plastic in the oceans and how it affects all those who live in and around it.</p>
<p>6. STOP THE GROWTH OF WASTE - A visual demonstration of the potential growth in landfill sites if nothing is done to reverse the current trends.</p>

</div></div>","What
The ArtWalk is an independent project to promote art, environmental awareness and community on the Garden Route.
The Artwalk consists of 10 large outdoor sculptural installations, made from recycled waste materials, that visitors and locals can enjoy viewing in the gardens of timberlake. The installations are made by local communities under the guidance of local artists.
Art + Environment + Community = ArtWalk
Background
The ArtWalk is the natural progression of the community and environmental experience of timberlake and the community World Cup decor project on Thesen Island, managed by Artwalk co-ordinators Melissa Daitz and Bruce Adams. 
The Garden Route relies on tourism for its livelihood, but is the natural beauty of the Garden Route being used sustainably and is tourism uplifting all communities? Local community projects exist in the towns of George, Sedgefield, and Knysna with most producing arts and crafts in an attempt to sustain their important activities. Yet many of these projects remain unknown and receive little support. The ArtWalk aims to change this.
Why
Your contribution to the ArtWalk project will help the Garden Route come together to create around Art and the Environment, and help community projects and local artists gain exposure and increase their earnings potential.
The ArtWalk builds a hub that brings different people together, creates something beautiful from waste, showcases local creativity, highlights environmental challenges and provides much needed involvement and exposure for local artists and community projects.
Each sculpture spotlights an environmental challange...Stimulating conversation and education about the Environment.
Installations and components are made by local communities under the guidance of local artists... Developing Art and design on the Garden Route.
If you are a visitor or plan to visit the Garden Route, this is your opportunity to give back in a creative way.


The Installations
We have raised funds for the first four outdoor sculptures and we are appealing for assistance to raise sponsorships and donations for the remaining six installations to realize the vision of the ArtWalk...
5. PLASTIC IN THE SEA - Drawing the viewers attention to the amount of plastic in the oceans and how it affects all those who live in and around it.
6. STOP THE GROWTH OF WASTE - A visual demonstration of the potential growth in landfill sites if nothing is done to reverse the current trends.
7. CARBON FOOTPRINT - Natural solutions to help reduce the carbon footprint of new development.
8. FRAGILITY OF THE PLANET - A thin green line, which denotes the fine line that separtates living sustainably from living in a way that is destructive to our planet.
9. WATER WISE - Water conservation and the statement of a waterless garden.
10. CONSUMERISM - The power that the consumer canbring to bear when they act with awareness.
Participate
ArtWalk is looking for sponsorship and donations to commission artists and local communities to create the six sculptural installations. 
Funding of $2000 will create one unique sculpture.
Funds raised are used to commission local artists and existing community projects to conceptualize and construct the sculptural installations. 
Main sponsors of a specific sculpture will have their logo or details incorporated into the installation.
All donors will have their names listed on the welcoming ArtWalk plaque that will greet visitors at the start of the ArtWalk, and on the ArtWalk map that will guide visitors to the installations, and be distributed as a brochure. 
If only part of the $2000 is raised and the amount is insufficient to create an entire installation, the funds will be donated to the community projects invoived.

<p>I was born and raised in Sicily. Studied there, took, my degree and PhD in Physics and as many of my colleagues I went abroad looking for opportunities. There are very few of them in Sicily, especially if you hold a high educational degree. I worked most of the time in US, as a “Cultural Heritage Scientist”, I do scientific examination of works of art for conservation and authentication. Last Fall I decided I wanted to go back home in Sicily and with the little money I saved I started up my own private business. It’s tough and a lot of traveling, since my customers are all across Europe, but when I get back home, I see my family and all that effort makes sense.</p>
<p>Sometimes ago I was reading a local newspaper “La Sicilia” and I found that one big page was used for a touristic ads about visiting Sicily.  Why the Sicilian Regional Tourism Office spends money to put an ads on a local newspaper read only by Sicilians? We want others around the world to know about Sicily, no?</p>

<p>I’m now based in Sicily. Most of my university colleagues, the most brilliant, actually, left the Country and found highly paid positions abroad. There is little left here. Most of the best brains are gone and Hope is dwindling.</p>
<p>I want to be proud of my Country, and I want innovative, effective and low-cost tools to show its beauty. I already use Panoramic HDR (High Dynamic Range) photography for paintings and fine arts documentation.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Sicily is a land of contrasts. Social contrasts are well known. Less known are its sceneries colors and lights contrast. The sunlight strikes the land fearfully while shadows are pitch dark. This is Sicily sensorial experience. Though, until recently there was no way to render in photos this lights contrast. This is digital cameras limitation, where actually our eye is superior. The dynamic range of digital cameras is less than that of our eye. This means they can render details just in the bright areas or in the dark ones. The human eye is much more powerful in that sense. Our eye has a much wider dynamic range, so we can tell details simultaneously in bright sunlit areas and in the shadows. HDR Panoramas bring all this together. Sicily in true Colors! </p>
<p>Panorams will be geolocated, so these Panoramas gallery is going to have an impact how travelers choose locations in Sicily.   </p>

<h3><strong>Our Mission</strong></h3>
<p>Guts Gallery aims are to provide financial support and exhibition opportunities for artists less platformed within today’s contemporary art scene; our desire is to facilitate space and exposure for BAME artists, female artists, working-class artists, queer artists, and artists outside of London (bridging the North/South divide)</p>
<p>Through initiating relationships between established and emerging artists, we can create an inclusive and diverse arts community, with a dynamic and interesting creative working environment, to produce new structures that enable emerging artists to have the exposure they are often denied.</p>
<p>From the 16-19th May 2019, Guts Gallery is opening its doors for the first time, exhibiting works from renowned and emerging practitioners at Ugly Duck’s London Bridge event space. An extensive programme has been curated, with talks, tours and spoken word events taking place, to produce and uphold creative networks for artists often not afforded such opportunities. In partnership with the company, Ugly Duck, whose large scale studio complex is being offered, enabling artists, community groups and the public to come together in London’s busy centre.</p>
<p>Running such a large exhibition is costly; your support is invaluable! By giving to  Guts Gallery’s opening exhibition you’ll be able to help us accomplish our goal of facilitating the success of emerging artists whose adversity often blocks their vital inclusion.  Our aim is to cultivate an art scene here in London that supports and promotes artists of low income backgrounds, as well as all artists of colour, sexual orientations and gender identities, to collectively demonstrate the cultural wealth, quality and importance of grassroots galleries and encourage new audiences from outside of London to enrich nation networks.</p>
<ul></ul>
<h3><strong>The Purpose </strong></h3>
<p>The distribution of wealth within the arts operates on a model which mirrors that of wider social austerity; it disproportionately benefits people who do not experience racial oppression, gender or class discriminations. In order to facilitate the success of struggling artists, individuals in the art world and institutions who are financially and creatively influential need to recognise and discuss the lack of resources available to a large number of artists who are systematically disadvantaged and unheard.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Van hire</p>
<p>This will help any artists who are struggling financially to transport their work to and from the gallery; many artists turn down exhibition opportunities because of the financial difficulties regarding transportation.</p>
<p>Maintenance tools and equipment</p>
<p>Tools and equipment for exhibition installs are extremely expensive. However, once we have these, we will be equipped both for our opening show and for future exhibitions.</p>
<p>Staff wage</p>
<p>We endeavour to pay Guts Gallery’s fantastic, hard-working staff, who are all juggling their commitment to Guts Gallery with their exhausting work schedules and studies. Many larger galleries do not pay their staff and rely on volunteers; we want to prove that, even as a small gallery, it is entirely feasible and fair to do so...</p>
<p>Marketing and the Exhibition Night</p>
<p>Marketing is vital in the run-up to an exhibition. We plan on designing tote bags, posters, stickers and a magazine in order to promote our inaugural event, seeking to create as much momentum and attention for the show, allowing the best possible platform on which to spread the Guts Gallery ethos.</p>
<p>For the exhibition evening itself, we are in need of benches, a PA system, debit/credit card readers and artist labels.</p>
<h3>What You Will Get</h3>
<p>Any donations over £100: An honorary mention on the Guts Gallery website and all social media platforms.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>Why should you donate to Guts Gallery?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You have the power to make an impact on the careers of emerging artists;.</li>
<li>You will be part of a movement that challenges inequality in the art world;</li>
<li>You will improve engagement and dialogue between better-known artists and those still looking to establish a voice;</li>
<li>You will be vital in making art more accessible to everyone;</li>
<li>You could spur less privileged, younger artists on, showing them they have a place;</li>
<li>You will support the future and success of smaller art galleries, especially at a time in which many small, not-for-profit venues are being closed down;</li>
<li>You will be part of an ever-expanding grassroots network, with a focus on promoting diverse artists.</li>
</ul>
<h3>About the Founder?</h3>
<p>Ellie Pennick is the founder of Guts Gallery. She is a queer, working-class artist from North Yorkshire. After leaving university in the Summer of 2017, she was accepted onto a Sculpture Masters course at the Royal College of Art. However, due to limited funds, she was unable to study there.</p>
<p>This spurred her on to think about how she could create a business venture that could benefit other struggling artists like herself. Many people are scared to speak out about inequality in the art world, often in fear of their own precarious positions being compromised. Pennick, through the creation of Guts Gallery, wanted a gallery that could speak out, a gallery with the guts to protest.</p>
<h3>Who Do We Support And Why?</h3>
<p><strong>// FEMALE ARTISTS</strong></p>
<p>One of the factors that have lead to the formation of the Gallery has been a drive to close the gender pay gap within the art world. According to a report published by the Freelands Foundation, throughout 2017 only 28% of artists represented by major commercial galleries in London were women, a fall from 29% the previous year. Gender disparity is a problem that thrives in most creative industries, and it is our goal that women occupy an equal space in the industry and percentages like these see an increase. Equal representation is just one aspect of gender disparity in the art world, and equal pay is another. Finding creative and innovative solutions to as broad a social issue as equality is something that we hope to incorporate into the running of the gallery.  </p>
<p><strong>// WORKING CLASS ARTISTS</strong></p>
<p>It is commonly known that the art world has historically been, and continues to be, dominated by the privileged elite. The art world’s approach to working-class artists is one which currently makes achieving success in the field considerably harder than it is for people of middle-class or financially privileged backgrounds. This is a structure that Guts Gallery will challenge. Providing a creative platform for those without financial privilege on their side is not only essential to the diversification of the art world, but also is a crucial part of opening up much-needed dialogues on social issues and current working-class problems.</p>
<p>Financial support and recognition of working-class artists are in due order. GQ recently published an article entitled ‘When will we give working-class creatives the support they deserve?' in which the life and artistic career of Laura Footes is explored. Footes bluntly described how she got to her position in the industry by 'building an identity based on fakeness' - creating an image that fits well into the art frame and alternative persona. The need to build different personas and identities in order to become a successful artist is not an idea that should exist. Instead, we should shape the frame to be more open, welcoming and understanding working-class artists and their refreshing opinions.</p>
<p><strong>// ARTISTS OUTSIDE OF LONDON // Bridging The North-South Divide</strong></p>
<p>Another way in which Guts intends to diversify the art world is by bridging the gap between the North and South of the UK. The London art scene is thriving, with lots of emerging artists getting representation and recognition. However, the physical and ideological distance between the North and South can mean that those who are thriving in the North don’t get the chance to be represented in the South, especially within London's artistic circles. Not only is this a great shame, it also seems creatively essential that artists whose work is appreciated and recognised in the North get the funding and opportunities to be recognised in the South too. Large amounts of working class artists establish themselves in the North and then find transferring or taking up artistic space elsewhere very difficult to do effectively. Appropriate funding would act as a necessary vector to move both art and artists across this geographical divide.  In a 2017 article in The Guardian, it was estimated that £700m worth of funding would be needed to completely bridge the artistic divide between the North and London. As it stands, the divide negatively impacts the UK’s cultural and creative progression. To even begin to bridge this vast gap is not only a step forward with regards to equal funding distribution but also a step forward with regards to the increased representation of working-class art and artists in the capital.</p>
<p><strong>// BAME (Black, Asian + Minority Ethnic) ARTISTS</strong></p>
<p>One of the most common debates with regards to the art world and its shortcomings in relation to equal artistic representation is the absence of BAME artists, especially in large established gallery spaces. In a 2017 Art-Net report, it was found that 80% of artists in NYC’s top galleries were white.</p>
<p>Although this figure stands with regards to New York art galleries, the story is much the same in London. Social mobility for BAME artists is something that is being talked about, but more can be done in order to give these artists the appropriate platform to showcase their work and thrive. If large art galleries are failing with regards to BAME representation with no excuse and the most amount of funding, then it is essential that smaller independent galleries, like Guts, recognise this negative trend of whiteness within the gallery space, and do as much as possible to change this fact. Equal representation and apt social change can begin on an independent level that will then, hopefully, be further echoed by larger galleries and art establishments.</p>
<p><strong>// QUEER ARTISTS</strong></p>
<p>Another area of the art industry’s shortcomings that we would like to focus on, and continue to improve through the gallery, is the representation of queer artists. On a significantly more positive note, queer visibility in art is something that is currently being boosted, with a host of queer artistic talent gaining significant recognition. However, as with any area of progression, a further positive incline in visibility is necessary. Increased recognition, and creating a further safe artistic space for queer artists to experiment and exhibit, is another goal of Guts.</p> <p><strong>// ARTISTS ON A LOW INCOME</strong></p>
<p>London is currently an expensive place to live with the high costs of living.  Artists continue to migrate away from London; popular alternatives include Margate, Ramsgate, Southend and Nottingham. Others have gone farther afield, to places such as Berlin - places that promise lower rents and less creative prohibition. The continuing hardships of London living create hostile working conditions for young people who subsequently remove themselves from their creative communities. Artists, disenfranchised by broken promises and unfeasible working conditions, opt to leave or are forced to leave. Support systems disintegrate after studies in creative fields are completed, and creative potential seems to come up against an expiry date. Artists now face a choice between working full time to pay the rent, to cover loans, and to support families, and their creative work seems to either be slotted into exhausting schedules, performed for free or totally abandoned.</p>
<p>The uncertainty of a post-Brexit art world only adds to the artist's adversity. According to the Arts Council, arts and culture contribute about £11.8bn to the UK economy, but the majority of artists earn less than £10,000 a year. The potential loss of the creative Europe programme funding could also prove detrimental to the industry. While there have not been any immediate changes and announcements regarding operators’ access to funding, the money may no longer be available once Britain leaves the Union, exacerbating what is already a tight financial situation and providing a major threat to the industry.</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","Our Mission
Guts Gallery aims are to provide financial support and exhibition opportunities for artists less platformed within today’s contemporary art scene; our desire is to facilitate space and exposure for BAME artists, female artists, working-class artists, queer artists, and artists outside of London (bridging the North/South divide)
Through initiating relationships between established and emerging artists, we can create an inclusive and diverse arts community, with a dynamic and interesting creative working environment, to produce new structures that enable emerging artists to have the exposure they are often denied.
From the 16-19th May 2019, Guts Gallery is opening its doors for the first time, exhibiting works from renowned and emerging practitioners at Ugly Duck’s London Bridge event space. An extensive programme has been curated, with talks, tours and spoken word events taking place, to produce and uphold creative networks for artists often not afforded such opportunities. In partnership with the company, Ugly Duck, whose large scale studio complex is being offered, enabling artists, community groups and the public to come together in London’s busy centre.
Running such a large exhibition is costly; your support is invaluable! By giving to  Guts Gallery’s opening exhibition you’ll be able to help us accomplish our goal of facilitating the success of emerging artists whose adversity often blocks their vital inclusion.  Our aim is to cultivate an art scene here in London that supports and promotes artists of low income backgrounds, as well as all artists of colour, sexual orientations and gender identities, to collectively demonstrate the cultural wealth, quality and importance of grassroots galleries and encourage new audiences from outside of London to enrich nation networks.

The Purpose 
The distribution of wealth within the arts operates on a model which mirrors that of wider social austerity; it disproportionately benefits people who do not experience racial oppression, gender or class discriminations. In order to facilitate the success of struggling artists, individuals in the art world and institutions who are financially and creatively influential need to recognise and discuss the lack of resources available to a large number of artists who are systematically disadvantaged and unheard.

What We Need
Van hire
This will help any artists who are struggling financially to transport their work to and from the gallery; many artists turn down exhibition opportunities because of the financial difficulties regarding transportation.
Maintenance tools and equipment
Tools and equipment for exhibition installs are extremely expensive. However, once we have these, we will be equipped both for our opening show and for future exhibitions.
Staff wage
We endeavour to pay Guts Gallery’s fantastic, hard-working staff, who are all juggling their commitment to Guts Gallery with their exhausting work schedules and studies. Many larger galleries do not pay their staff and rely on volunteers; we want to prove that, even as a small gallery, it is entirely feasible and fair to do so...
Marketing and the Exhibition Night
Marketing is vital in the run-up to an exhibition. We plan on designing tote bags, posters, stickers and a magazine in order to promote our inaugural event, seeking to create as much momentum and attention for the show, allowing the best possible platform on which to spread the Guts Gallery ethos.
For the exhibition evening itself, we are in need of benches, a PA system, debit/credit card readers and artist labels.
What You Will Get
Any donations over £100: An honorary mention on the Guts Gallery website and all social media platforms.

About the Founder?
Ellie Pennick is the founder of Guts Gallery. She is a queer, working-class artist from North Yorkshire. After leaving university in the Summer of 2017, she was accepted onto a Sculpture Masters course at the Royal College of Art. However, due to limited funds, she was unable to study there.
This spurred her on to think about how she could create a business venture that could benefit other struggling artists like herself. Many people are scared to speak out about inequality in the art world, often in fear of their own precarious positions being compromised. Pennick, through the creation of Guts Gallery, wanted a gallery that could speak out, a gallery with the guts to protest.
Who Do We Support And Why?
// FEMALE ARTISTS
One of the factors that have lead to the formation of the Gallery has been a drive to close the gender pay gap within the art world. According to a report published by the Freelands Foundation, throughout 2017 only 28% of artists represented by major commercial galleries in London were women, a fall from 29% the previous year. Gender disparity is a problem that thrives in most creative industries, and it is our goal that women occupy an equal space in the industry and percentages like these see an increase. Equal representation is just one aspect of gender disparity in the art world, and equal pay is another. Finding creative and innovative solutions to as broad a social issue as equality is something that we hope to incorporate into the running of the gallery.  
// WORKING CLASS ARTISTS
It is commonly known that the art world has historically been, and continues to be, dominated by the privileged elite. The art world’s approach to working-class artists is one which currently makes achieving success in the field considerably harder than it is for people of middle-class or financially privileged backgrounds. This is a structure that Guts Gallery will challenge. Providing a creative platform for those without financial privilege on their side is not only essential to the diversification of the art world, but also is a crucial part of opening up much-needed dialogues on social issues and current working-class problems.
Financial support and recognition of working-class artists are in due order. GQ recently published an article entitled ‘When will we give working-class creatives the support they deserve?' in which the life and artistic career of Laura Footes is explored. Footes bluntly described how she got to her position in the industry by 'building an identity based on fakeness' - creating an image that fits well into the art frame and alternative persona. The need to build different personas and identities in order to become a successful artist is not an idea that should exist. Instead, we should shape the frame to be more open, welcoming and understanding working-class artists and their refreshing opinions.
// ARTISTS OUTSIDE OF LONDON // Bridging The North-South Divide
Another way in which Guts intends to diversify the art world is by bridging the gap between the North and South of the UK. The London art scene is thriving, with lots of emerging artists getting representation and recognition. However, the physical and ideological distance between the North and South can mean that those who are thriving in the North don’t get the chance to be represented in the South, especially within London's artistic circles. Not only is this a great shame, it also seems creatively essential that artists whose work is appreciated and recognised in the North get the funding and opportunities to be recognised in the South too. Large amounts of working class artists establish themselves in the North and then find transferring or taking up artistic space elsewhere very difficult to do effectively. Appropriate funding would act as a necessary vector to move both art and artists across this geographical divide.  In a 2017 article in The Guardian, it was estimated that £700m worth of funding would be needed to completely bridge the artistic divide between the North and London. As it stands, the divide negatively impacts the UK’s cultural and creative progression. To even begin to bridge this vast gap is not only a step forward with regards to equal funding distribution but also a step forward with regards to the increased representation of working-class art and artists in the capital.
// BAME (Black, Asian + Minority Ethnic) ARTISTS
One of the most common debates with regards to the art world and its shortcomings in relation to equal artistic representation is the absence of BAME artists, especially in large established gallery spaces. In a 2017 Art-Net report, it was found that 80% of artists in NYC’s top galleries were white.

Social mobility for BAME artists is something that is being talked about, but more can be done in order to give these artists the appropriate platform to showcase their work and thrive.

 “Time is an illusion” Albert EinsteinThe TEMPO. MEMORIA: Daring to Dream Again project curated by Sergio Gomez (owner of Art NXT Level Project/33 Contemporary Gallery and curator at the Zhou B Art Center) presents a riveting exhibition exploring the themes of TIME and MEMORY from a variety of world perspectives. From cultural, political, psychological, religious, or personal view points, curator Gomez invited a selective group of international artists to visually articulate and interpret to their discretion ideas of time passing, memory, dreams and our personal perceptions on such concepts. This exhibition also includes a participatory element. Visitors to the exhibition will be invited to write a note about a personal memory and post it on a wall, creating a living work of collective memories.
The MIIT (Museo Internazionale Italia Arte) is a new museum located in the heart of the city of Turin, Italy in a fervent neighborhood of galleries, museums and foundations. 


The exhibition will feature twenty-five extraordinary visual artists representing the US (Chicago, New York, Miami), Peru, Korea, Germany, Spain, Iran, Mexico, France and the Philippines. All the works have been exclusively created for this exhibition. This international exhibition invites the viewer to an exploratory journey experiencing global interpretations of TIME and MEMORY while reflecting on their own personal emotions and memories.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
Hello, thank you for taking the time to read more about our project! This is a fundraiser for the soon to be 'Wondabubba and the Big Splash' hard cover book! Ever since I (Illustrator) was a child I have had the dream to make childrens books and to have them published for other kids to read. Finally I have a chance to publish one of my greatest co-creations yet 'Wondabubba and the Big Splash!' as a 32 + page fully illustrated story book. Originallly the project started as a multimedia presentation by Gary Giles (Author), the original mind behind the world of Wondabubba. He took this production as a one man show and presented it to schools and other functions through out the USA and this is an ongoing production. He commissioned me to illustrate his story and we commenced on a nine month long journey to completion! I am so excited to have this opportunity to inspire the next generation of young Creatives and have such a positive impact in this world! I have been entrusted with the task to have this book printed and I am so thrilled to finally see it realized!</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
Hear's the plan. The goal is set to $12,000 which will go enirely into printing what will be a minimum of 1000 copies to distribute around the world (we hope to print 1500). Ten percent will support the artist (me) while I spend the necessary time putting in the final touches, and even painting whole new sections of page spreads. Once the needed funds are aqcuired and all editing is done we will commence in printing. We want it to be affordable at a maximum of $20 per book, ideally less and this is factored into the expenses. Any remaining money will go towards getting the book out to all of you amazing co-creators! If we don't reach our goal we will still go to print if possible, otherwise we will start another campaign. The number one priority for us is the book! And we are dedicated to making it happen!</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
This is an amazing project and many will benefit as the message of Wondabubba and the Big Splash is both timely and inspiring to behold, both in it's message and it's artistry. This is a book that will be remembered as one of the greatest childrens books of all time! &lt;- (Words of the Author) 'Wondabubba and the Big Splash!' is a fun adventure story which teaches by simple example the power of friendship, cooperation and unselfishness. I feel it is a message we sorely need in these times.</div>

<p></p><p><b>MY PROJECT: </b>

""The Golden Hour"" is an exhibition entirely dedicated to the elemental life force and power of the sun (or all suns). More specifically, how suns creates light, life and almost everything in the universe.  This show will be my homage to a mother sun creating my own spirituality from this idea.  Most of my neon tubing will be filled with Helium (He pictured above) which is the second most abundant element in the Universe and the first element created by atomic fusion within a star (Hydrogen fuses to create Helium). Coincidentally, the color of helium in a neon tube is a warm peach color similar to the shine of most stars.  From Helium, a long list of elements are created by the same process, eventually producing heavier elements that we are very familiar with such as iron, carbon, oxygen.  In my works, I am using iron in steel frames for panels, carbon in deer hide and wood frames and oxygen with a panel of live plants (specifically cactus for conceptual reasons).  I will also be creating three more Periodic Elements in neon: Gold (Au), Silver (Ag) and Copper (Cu).  These three precious metals are elements that are ONLY created during supernovae explosions (when a star dies and explodes).  This is why we call them precious metals.  Some other things viewers can expect to see:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>Three stretched deer hide works featuring Rorschachs (inkblots) and neon tubing</li>
<li>Two 3'x6' panels - one filled with pyrite (fools gold) and neon tubing, the other a live succulent panel combined with neon</li>
<li>A neon ""bridge"".  30 straight tubes of neon in a color progression that represents the sunset.  The tubes will span overhead, horizontally, across the width of the hallway and run the entire length leading into the exhibition room.</li>

the center, surrounded by a thorny wreath, and placed on a cross that divided
the background into four sections.  Each quarter
contained an image representing one of the four ancient elements: Earth, Water,
Air, and Fire. In a flash of insight, I realized that the symbolism of the
design was entirely interchangeable with that of the Tarot's World card. The
dancing nude on the World, like this heart, is centered in a wreath and can be
interpreted as a symbol for the soul. The creatures representing the four
evangelists, standing in the corners of the World card, are also symbolically
connected to the four elements through their correlation to the fixed signs of
the zodiac. The thought came to me that if the final Tarot trump and the goal of the alchemical Great Work are related, all of the trumps may also relate to the Great Work. This realization was like a key that opened a lock to a forgotten
door. I was mesmerized as images poured out of this new portal in my mind. They
formed a parade of alchemical illustrations that were spontaneously paired with
Tarot trumps and it became clear that the series of trumps does describe the
alchemical Great Work. This

<p>The first edition of <i>The
Alchemical Tarot</i> was published by Harper Collins, in London in 1995.  By 2003, it was out of print, but its
reputation continued to grow. First editions of the deck and book set have sold
on eBay for up to $2,075.00.  Although I
have created eleven Tarot decks and authored several books on the Tarot
and mysticism, including <i>The Tarot:
history, Symbolism, and Divination</i>, which Booklist said may be the best
book ever written on the subject, <i>The
Alchemical Tarot</i> is what I am best known for.  In 2007,  I regained the
rights to my work and published an updated version with improvements to the
drawings and composition.  This was <i>The Alchemical Tarot: Renewed</i>. That
edition and the next, <i>The Alchemical
Tarot: Renewed 3<sup>rd</sup> Edition</i>, are now out of print and I am ready
to print <i>The Alchemical Tarot: Renewed 4<sup>th</sup>
Edition</i>.  For each edition I have
made improvements to the drawings and coloring, I have added alchemical
symbolism, and designed a new card back. I have continued this process for the
Fourth, and I feel that this is the best edition of <i>The Alchemical Tarot</i>. </p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1154105/files/20150116130427-72-Hermit_-Hermetic_Museum_1625.jpg?1421442267"" src="""" style=""width: 583.9217391304348px;height: 371px;""/></p><p>   </p>
<p><i>The Alchemical Tarot: Renewed</i> is a full 79 card Tarot deck (with two

fourth edition of <i>The Alchemical Tarot: Renewed</i> is a digitally
redesigned version of the original with improvements. As with the other renewed
versions, the art has been reproportioned so that the images are more prominent

improvements in the drawings and colored them with transparent colors on a rich
antique paper background, like an antique alchemical illustration. The cards
will be 4.75 x 2.75 and come in a tuck box. They will be printed on the
same heavy card stock as my Tarot of the Sevenfold Mystery and have the same
durable finish and die-cut edges.  The deck includes the original Lovers
card that was censored in the first publication and, as in the original, the

<br/></div>","In the summer of 1987, I was obsessed with the mysteries of alchemy.  One afternoon, I was reading Grillot de Givry’s Picture Museum when I became fascinated by an illustration representing the Philosopher's Stone, the magical substance whose creation is the goal of the alchemical Great Work.  The illustration depicted the Stone as a type of mandala with a heart in
the center, surrounded by a thorny wreath, and placed on a cross that divided
the background into four sections.  Each quarter
contained an image representing one of the four ancient elements: Earth, Water,
Air, and Fire. In a flash of insight, I realized that the symbolism of the
design was entirely interchangeable with that of the Tarot's World card. The
dancing nude on the World, like this heart, is centered in a wreath and can be
interpreted as a symbol for the soul. The creatures representing the four
evangelists, standing in the corners of the World card, are also symbolically
connected to the four elements through their correlation to the fixed signs of
the zodiac. The thought came to me that if the final Tarot trump and the goal of the alchemical Great Work are related, all of the trumps may also relate to the Great Work. This realization was like a key that opened a lock to a forgotten
door. I was mesmerized as images poured out of this new portal in my mind. They
formed a parade of alchemical illustrations that were spontaneously paired with
Tarot trumps and it became clear that the series of trumps does describe the
alchemical Great Work. This
insight led to years of research, and to the creation to one of the most
beautiful and meaningful modern Tarot decks, The Alchemical Tarot.
The first edition of The
Alchemical Tarot was published by Harper Collins, in London in 1995.  By 2003, it was out of print, but its
reputation continued to grow. First editions of the deck and book set have sold
on eBay for up to $2,075.00.  Although I

history, Symbolism, and Divination, which Booklist said may be the best
book ever written on the subject, The
Alchemical Tarot is what I am best known for.  In 2007,  I regained the
rights to my work and published an updated version with improvements to the
drawings and composition.  This was The Alchemical Tarot: Renewed. That
edition and the next, The Alchemical
Tarot: Renewed 3rd Edition, are now out of print and I am ready
to print The Alchemical Tarot: Renewed 4th
Edition.  For each edition I have
made improvements to the drawings and coloring, I have added alchemical
symbolism, and designed a new card back. I have continued this process for the
Fourth, and I feel that this is the best edition of The Alchemical Tarot.    
The Alchemical Tarot: Renewed is a full 79 card Tarot deck (with two
versions of the Lovers) that demonstrates the close link between alchemical
symbolism and traditional Tarot imagery, and illustrates that the Tarot, like
the alchemical quest, is designed to lead one to the gold of inner wisdom. The
fourth edition of The Alchemical Tarot: Renewed is a digitally
redesigned version of the original with improvements. As with the other renewed
versions, the art has been reproportioned so that the images are more prominent

antique paper background, like an antique alchemical illustration. The cards
will be 4.75 x 2.75 and come in a tuck box. They will be printed on the
same heavy card stock as my Tarot of the Sevenfold Mystery and have the same

card that was censored in the first publication and, as in the original, the
Pages have been replaced with female figures, called Lades, to maintain the
sexual balance. The deck has additional alchemical symbols added, such as the
symbols for the alchemical operations that appear on each trump, and a new card
back that may be the best one that I have designed. Each card in the fourth

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a="""">Hello! My name is James Helenski and I am a trans artist working out of Boston. In May I will be graduating from <i>The New England School of Art &amp; Design</i> with a degree in Fine Arts and Philosophy. My studio practice focuses mainly on printmaking, collage, sculpture, and performance art. For the past year, I have been interning with Liz Shepherd at her studio <i>Shepherd Print Studio</i>. Through my time in her studio I was able to connect with the <i>Icelandic Printmakers Association</i>. In the most incredible series of events I have been able to establish a residency program in their studio in Reykjavik this summer from June 10th - July 10th. <br/><div>
<br/>
<p>I am absolutely ecstatic over this wonderful opportunity and cannot wait to fly over. However, being a soon to be graduated art student my funds are not exactly in a place to support an extended stay in Iceland. With your help I hope to raise enough to cover the cost of air fair, living expenses, printing supplies, and shipping all of those supplies to Iceland. <br/></p>
<p>I already have specific projects that I plan to carry out while in the Icelandic Printmakers' studio. Utilizing imagery from performances I have done in the past year which uses the body as its primary medium, I hope to further manipulate the body and translate the creation and destruction of the understood body into a print medium. I have included some of these videos in the gallery tab so you can take a look! I have many years of experience in screen printing, woodblock and linoleum cuts, and etching, but my hope is to explore this through cyanotypes, a process I have not yet had much experience with.</p>
<p>Reaching my goal ensures that I will not only be able to create a significant body of work, but also have the opportunity to connect with a trans community on the international stage. </p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>My goal is to raise at least $5,000 to mitigate the costs of flying to and from Reykjavik, travel within Iceland, buying supplies and shipping them over (I've been told it will be much cheaper to buy them here in America and ship them to the studio rather than buy them all there), living costs, and exchange rates.<br/><br/>
<p>If you check out the perks column you can see all the various goodies you can get for your contributions from a nice postcard, to zines, to prints. Any donations are greatly appreciated and I honestly cannot thank you enough but I hope I've figured out a few things that might begin to show you my appreciation. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I know this may seem like a project that will have very little impact beyond my own personal experience, but this has the opportunity to establish a new residency program and strong connection between <i>Shepherd Print Studio </i>and the<i> Icelandic Printmakers Association</i>. The success of this project can help future students, like myself, access an amazing experience and take the first steps in their professional artistic careers. It also allows for the opportunity of building a friendship with the trans community of Iceland of which I hope to connect with during my stay.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> There are very few risks and challenges that could present themselves. The residency is already in place, so I will not have to wait to hear back from a review board to see if I am granted a stay with the <i>Icelandic Printmakers</i>. All it comes down to is actually creating the work while I'm there. I could run into complications or technical issues with equipment in the studio which may impact my ability to print. However, the length of my stay should offer plenty of time to solve these issues should they appear and with the technique I am planning on exploring the most, cyanotypes, I can use the good old sun instead of fancy light exposure boxes.

</div></div>","Hello! My name is James Helenski and I am a trans artist working out of Boston. In May I will be graduating from The New England School of Art & Design with a degree in Fine Arts and Philosophy. My studio practice focuses mainly on printmaking, collage, sculpture, and performance art. For the past year, I have been interning with Liz Shepherd at her studio Shepherd Print Studio. Through my time in her studio I was able to connect with the Icelandic Printmakers Association. In the most incredible series of events I have been able to establish a residency program in their studio in Reykjavik this summer from June 10th - July 10th. 

I am absolutely ecstatic over this wonderful opportunity and cannot wait to fly over. However, being a soon to be graduated art student my funds are not exactly in a place to support an extended stay in Iceland. With your help I hope to raise enough to cover the cost of air fair, living expenses, printing supplies, and shipping all of those supplies to Iceland. 
I already have specific projects that I plan to carry out while in the Icelandic Printmakers' studio. Utilizing imagery from performances I have done in the past year which uses the body as its primary medium, I hope to further manipulate the body and translate the creation and destruction of the understood body into a print medium. I have included some of these videos in the gallery tab so you can take a look! I have many years of experience in screen printing, woodblock and linoleum cuts, and etching, but my hope is to explore this through cyanotypes, a process I have not yet had much experience with.
Reaching my goal ensures that I will not only be able to create a significant body of work, but also have the opportunity to connect with a trans community on the international stage. 

  What I Need & What You GetMy goal is to raise at least $5,000 to mitigate the costs of flying to and from Reykjavik, travel within Iceland, buying supplies and shipping them over (I've been told it will be much cheaper to buy them here in America and ship them to the studio rather than buy them all there), living costs, and exchange rates.
If you check out the perks column you can see all the various goodies you can get for your contributions from a nice postcard, to zines, to prints. Any donations are greatly appreciated and I honestly cannot thank you enough but I hope I've figured out a few things that might begin to show you my appreciation. 

  The Impact I know this may seem like a project that will have very little impact beyond my own personal experience, but this has the opportunity to establish a new residency program and strong connection between Shepherd Print Studio and the Icelandic Printmakers Association. The success of this project can help future students, like myself, access an amazing experience and take the first steps in their professional artistic careers. It also allows for the opportunity of building a friendship with the trans community of Iceland of which I hope to connect with during my stay.

  Risks & Challenges  There are very few risks and challenges that could present themselves. The residency is already in place, so I will not have to wait to hear back from a review board to see if I am granted a stay with the Icelandic Printmakers. All it comes down to is actually creating the work while I'm there. I could run into complications or technical issues with equipment in the studio which may impact my ability to print. However, the length of my stay should offer plenty of time to solve these issues should they appear and with the technique I am planning on exploring the most, cyanotypes, I can use the good old sun instead of fancy light exposure boxes. As I mentioned earlier I have not had much experience with the cyanotype process, but before I leave I will be working with my professors to get the basics down as well as creating a few test prints which will then allow me to experiment and try new approaches to the process while in Iceland. 
My time in school has helped me develop a drive to be in the studio regularly and even though I will also be exploring Iceland since I have never been, I assure you that a good majority of my time will be spent working in the studio!

Hi there! My name is Nim, and I have been sculpting for several years for my jewelry line Rude &amp; Reckless.

Your contributions will bring this project to fruition, by enabling me to purchase the proper mold making materials, essential oils, and enough soap making and packaging supplies to make this happen. YOU are the reason the finished product will not only turn out, but look and smell amazing! <br/><br/>I  already have experience in soap making! The soaps I have made in the past are all hypoallergenic, and vegan friendly (containing no animal byproducts) and I'm in the midst of getting certified cruelty free by Peta. That is something I care quite a bit about. I use only essential oils as well, yes they are a bit more expensive in most cases, but they are so amazing, and using real ingredients instead of synthetics is what I prefer. <br/>I need to repurchase all of my supplies as have very little on hand to even start with. I'm basically starting from scratch. Each of the finished Elder God bars will weigh approximately 3 oz, will come in ""Musk of the Elder God"" scent and will be your choice of either gray or green.<br/><br/>In order to make this magic happen, I will be making several molds from the original sculpture. These molds will enable me to pour and shape the soaps. I will be using silicone rubber for mold making as it is highly heat resistant, and will work wonderfully for this project.  I am aiming at getting enough supplies to not only begin this project, but to help as a start up for creating something more out of this endeavor. With enough funds I will readily be able to cast some of the other sculpts I have made into beautiful soap bars.<br/><br/>Cost for supplies breakdown:<br/>Silicone rubber and additional mold making supplies/brushes/pouring and mixing containers: $180<br/>Bulk soap making supplies/Shae butter/Mango Butter, Glycerin, Carrier oils<br/>(Sweet almond, avocado, coconut, jojoba, castor oil, vitamin E etc) /mica pigments in several colors/essential oils: $350 (The ingredients I buy are only top notch, making them a bit more pricey, but so well worth the end result)<br/>Epsom salts and lip balm ingredients/carnauba wax, candelilla wax, olive oil, flavoring etc. $60<br/>Heat sealer/shrink wrap and label making supplies for soaps, lip balms, bath salts and sanity serum: $150<br/>I also have to take into account shipping boxes/tape/bubble wrap and other packaging, I'm estimating this at around $75. <br/>The remaining amount is for the additional percentage that Indigogo will take after<br/>the finding goes through.<br/>All of this money will be taken out of the funds, and it all adds up quickly!<br/><br/><br/>This is an all or nothing campaign, so If I do not reach the desired amount you will get your donation back. If this project is fully funded, not only will Cthulu be very pleased, but you will receive your bar(s) of soap in relative quickness.

<h3></h3>
<p>My name is Jonny and I am a 28 year old web entrepreneur from Colorado and I'm on a mission to accelerate the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin in every country in the world with help from stickers and YOU. </p>
<p>Yup, stickers. It is my goal to produce and distribute at least 1,000,000 stickers around the world with 1 question and 1 call to action.</p>
<p>""What is Bitcoin?"" and ""#TryBitcoin""</p>
<p>This simple question will get people to wonder what Bitcoin is in hopes that they will search for an answer.</p>
<p>I am using a hashtag because I want people to be able to unite online around a common goal surrounding this project and get more people to #TryBitcoin! </p>
<p>I feel that these 2 phrases are enough to get people to look into Bitcoin further and help it into mainstream acceptance.</p>
<p>Here is what I would like to achieve with this project:</p>
<p>- Produce and Distribute at least 1,000,000 stickers or more with the help of the Bitcoin community around the world and people just like you.</p>
<p>- Accelerate the widespread awareness, knowledge and adoption of Bitcoin all around the world.</p>
<p>- Get people to actually try Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Pledge packages are really simple. $5 gets you 5 stickers shipped to your door. $10 get you 10, $20 gets you 20, $50 $100 etc. All sticker packages are mix and match so you can pick from all of the designs available at the end of the campaign. </p>
<p>Here are the first 4 designs for the project so far. I will br producing 3 more designs for every $1000 that gets pledged to the project. I have about 20 other designs ready to go into production and I want to have more than 100 designs in circulation by the end of Spring of 2014. I need to create a massive minimum order to get the best deal with the first production run. I might even open up some contests to have people submit their own designs and let people vote on which one gets put into production. <br/></p>

Yup, stickers. It is my goal to produce and distribute at least 1,000,000 stickers around the world with 1 question and 1 call to action.
""What is Bitcoin?"" and ""#TryBitcoin""
This simple question will get people to wonder what Bitcoin is in hopes that they will search for an answer.
I am using a hashtag because I want people to be able to unite online around a common goal surrounding this project and get more people to #TryBitcoin! 
I feel that these 2 phrases are enough to get people to look into Bitcoin further and help it into mainstream acceptance.
Here is what I would like to achieve with this project:
- Produce and Distribute at least 1,000,000 stickers or more with the help of the Bitcoin community around the world and people just like you.
- Accelerate the widespread awareness, knowledge and adoption of Bitcoin all around the world.
- Get people to actually try Bitcoin.
Pledge packages are really simple. $5 gets you 5 stickers shipped to your door. $10 get you 10, $20 gets you 20, $50 $100 etc. All sticker packages are mix and match so you can pick from all of the designs available at the end of the campaign. 
Here are the first 4 designs for the project so far. I will br producing 3 more designs for every $1000 that gets pledged to the project. I have about 20 other designs ready to go into production and I want to have more than 100 designs in circulation by the end of Spring of 2014. I need to create a massive minimum order to get the best deal with the first production run. I might even open up some contests to have people submit their own designs and let people vote on which one gets put into production.

<p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle""><span style=""font-family: Times;"">Right now, I draw exclusively
with graphite and paint on paper or canvas. My drawings are primarily
figurative and I have honed my mark making to an autobiographical style that is
gestural to the point of almost being physical, yet the marks maintain a

as a <i style="""">feeling </i>as well as a visual.</span></p><p></p></span><p></p>
<p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle""><span style=""font-family: Times;"">My struggle, as usual, is to
communicate in my compositions a sense of “present”. I want to transfer to the
viewer of my drawings the moment as I actually experience it. This means more
than simply reproducing objects, it means, “capturing time”. This struggle
continues. </span></p><p></p></span><p></p>
<p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle""><span style=""font-family: Times;"">I have had notable exhibitions

me I was capable of riding multi state cycle tours by myself. I did it, several
times. I carry my gear, food, water, camping where I can and staying in hotels
once and a while to clean up. The experience of travel on two wheels humbles
me. It allows me to be stripped of pretense and the practice of calculating my moments.
When I am on a tour, I am Teri, plain and simple, and it feels real.</span></p><p></p></span><p></p>
<p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle""><span style=""font-family: Times;"">When I meet people along the way,
they are comfortably drawn to me with questions and comments. The bike seems
like an equalizer of sorts. Everybody has experience riding bikes, and most

<p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle""><span style=""font-family: Times;"">I will take an entire year to
travel via bicycle to twenty towns with a population of under 10,000 people. I
will choose towns within a 250-mile radius of a base location (as yet to be
determined). In each small town, I will find a central square or some other
heavily traveled area and I will draw. I will make three drawings of the area
and the people passing, attempting to capture “a moment in time”. I will give
one drawing to someone in the town. I will do this because the idea of someone
who really loves a work owning it reminds me that “selling” isn’t a good reason
to make the drawings. I will save one drawing to auction, with 100% of proceeds
donated to United Way, a national system of volunteers, contributors, and local
charities helping people in their own communities. The final drawing will
become a part of a traveling exhibition to be shown in or near as many of the
towns as possible. </span></p><p></p><p></p>

drawings, traveling to the city of the drawing via bicycle.<span style="""">  </span>Twenty drawings will be given to

of smart phones, text messaging, laptops, video gaming, tweeting, blogging and

narrative drawings creates a set of circumstances perfect for face to face
human communication, sometimes a few short words, but more often than not
profound in its connection.</span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle""><span style=""font-family: Times;"">Thoreau spoke of a “wish to live
deliberately”. Drawings produced in this way, through this project, will give

DELIBERATE CONNECTIONS
My Passion: 
My drawings are about people connecting.
The act of drawing can connect
people.
When I take to the streets with
drawing paper and pencil, and the intent of creating a narrative with the
moment, the narrative creates itself. People use the drawing as a springboard
for conversation. I see them sometimes circling, craning their necks to see the
picture. I look up, I smile, and they approach. 
When I take to the streets with
drawing paper and pencil, and the intent of creating a narrative with the moment,
profound things always happen. People reach out to me because I listen. I
experience their conversation with honest mature wonder and reflect back to
them their own beauty. 
When I take to the streets with
drawing paper and pencil, and the intent of creating a narrative with the
moment, the drawing that results captures not only the physical space, but also
the energy of every person that talks to me, every person that passes close by
to look, if only for a moment long enough for me to record them with my pencil.

 






My History:
As
artist: 
I have been making and exhibiting
art for over twenty years. In all that time I have experimented with almost
every material. I always come back to drawing. 
Right now, I draw exclusively
with graphite and paint on paper or canvas. My drawings are primarily
figurative and I have honed my mark making to an autobiographical style that is
gestural to the point of almost being physical, yet the marks maintain a
delicateness of application and intent hoping that the drawings are experienced
as a feeling as well as a visual.
My struggle, as usual, is to
communicate in my compositions a sense of “present”. I want to transfer to the
viewer of my drawings the moment as I actually experience it. This means more
than simply reproducing objects, it means, “capturing time”. This struggle
continues. 
I have had notable exhibitions
across the United States and Europe, most notably Chicago, Boston, Nashville,
St. Louis, Paducah Kentucky and Innsbruck Austria. My exhibition history can be
found at www.tmoore2.com
(resume).


Six people sat on this bench during the four hours I sat drawing at the Government Center Line. I talked to them all. Some were nervous, some excited; all were curious.

As cyclist:
My drawings are physical partly
because I am physical. Running turned to cycling in the mid nineties, and cycling
has become a lifetime obsession. 
When I am riding, my bike becomes
an extension of my body. 
Some years ago a friend convinced
me I was capable of riding multi state cycle tours by myself. I did it, several
times. I carry my gear, food, water, camping where I can and staying in hotels
once and a while to clean up. The experience of travel on two wheels humbles
me. It allows me to be stripped of pretense and the practice of calculating my moments.
When I am on a tour, I am Teri, plain and simple, and it feels real.
When I meet people along the way,
they are comfortably drawn to me with questions and comments. The bike seems
like an equalizer of sorts. Everybody has experience riding bikes, and most
everyone has a story about their experience riding that they want to share.  Just like when I am drawing, they talk,
and I listen. The communication is real as we connect. 



Surly Long Haul Trucker, my chariot. Bob, my trailer, and one person tent, my home (yellow bag under the table). Somewhere, Northern Illinois.

The parallel: 
Drawing and
cycling both create honest and real face-to-face connections.
 
The Project:
I will take an entire year to
travel via bicycle to twenty towns with a population of under 10,000 people. I
will choose towns within a 250-mile radius of a base location (as yet to be
determined). In each small town, I will find a central square or some other
heavily traveled area and I will draw. I will make three drawings of the area
and the people passing, attempting to capture “a moment in time”. I will give
one drawing to someone in the town. I will do this because the idea of someone
who really loves a work owning it reminds me that “selling” isn’t a good reason
to make the drawings. I will save one drawing to auction, with 100% of proceeds
donated to United Way, a national system of volunteers, contributors, and local
charities helping people in their own communities. The final drawing will
become a part of a traveling exhibition to be shown in or near as many of the
towns as possible. 
In one year I will make sixty
drawings, traveling to the city of the drawing via bicycle.  Twenty drawings will be given to
someone in the town, twenty drawings will be auctioned with 100% of the
proceeds going to United Way, and twenty drawings will be included in a
traveling exhibition.
 
Why should you care?
In a day
of smart phones, text messaging, laptops, video gaming, tweeting, blogging and
endless forms of electronic communication this project hails to a sense of oft
ignored “humanness”. Traveling through towns on my bike and working on
narrative drawings creates a set of circumstances perfect for face to face
human communication, sometimes a few short words, but more often than not
profound in its connection.
Thoreau spoke of a “wish to live
deliberately”. Drawings produced in this way, through this project, will give
voice to the desire in all of us to “communicate deliberately”. And you can
help me do it by being a contributor to my indigogo campaign. 
It is my dream to create a larger
“humanness”, and to share the result of this project with as many people in as
many ways as possible.
“The future belongs to those who
believe in the beauty of their dreams” Eleanor Roosevelt
 


The children were drawn to me because I arrived on bike. I gave them paper and we all sat together to draw....until dad came to find them. I had dinner with them. Nice connection.
What I need: bike/draw connecting for
one year
§  HomeBase; in the form of renting a studio (PROVIDED, IN KIND!)
§ 
Living stuff (food, insurance, cell phone, clothes, incidentals)
§ 
On the road housing in the form of camp fees and an occasional hotel to
clean up in 
§ 
Specialized bike gear/equipment (I already have the bike and the
trailer, will need tires, tubes, pre trip bike overhaul)
§ 
Waterproof carrier for drawings/drawing supplies (like bike messengers carry)
§ 
Final Presentation materials (framing, hooks etc. for forty drawings)
)  Exhibition/Auction space rentals, and refreshments (up to ten spaces
throughout the scope of the travel radius of the project)

Other Ways You Can Help 
If a financial contribution isn’t possible for you,
you can spread the word, spread the word, spread the word! If you know folks
who can and would contribute to the beauty of this project, please pass this on
so it can happen.
And….smile today at someone you might not notice on
an average day; give someone an honest compliment; look a person in the eye and
take time to listen after you ask how they are.
We are all in this together.

I am not sure what Kay was saying, but she was so pleased to connect with me, that she came to get me later to try to get me to talk to a group of ""regulars"" at the Duncan Donuts next door. It made us both SMILE.
  
What will happen to your donation
if this campaign does not reach its funding goal?
The Project will be completed, and all of the perks
will be given. I will just scale down the time and distance to match what the
total of the donations allow. (But lets not allow that to happen….a year of concentrated
connections will produce profound drawings
and experiences we will all share and benefit from.",5.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p>We
think there is a need for a place where good artists can start selling their
art,  take the first steps into the market
and get noticed all around the world.</p>
<p>We
also think there is a need for a place where people can spot and buy original
artworks at an affordable price, with or without having  trading skills.</p>
<p>We
would like Startartist to be the answer to these needs. We want it to be global
and we want it to be equal.</p>
<p><b>Why is Startartist different:</b></p>
<p>There
are plenty of  sites out there where you
can find artists and buy art, but  we’ve
always hadthe impression that you have to pay a lot of money for something
meaningful, or to be extremely gifted to select an artist  from the pile. Furthermore, it’s always seemed to us that, if something
has a reasonable price, somehow there is a trick.</p>
<p>At
Startartist, we’ve got a set of rules in
mind that must  be followed by the artists
 who want to get on board: once you are
in, you will have your display on our platform and you will be ready to sell.
As a customer, you will be able to surf through the database by multiple
criteria,  in line with what you are
looking for. No surprises: simple and equal.</p>
<p>And
 most importantly: you will buy  certified originals from a fresh talented
artist.</p>
<p><b>Why are we planning a crowd funding campaign?</b></p>
<p>Crowd
funding such a social idea is a way of testing it, and making people part of
its development. We may sound crazy, but even  if we had the budget, we would be doing exactly
what we are doing.</p>
<p><b>How do you expect people to fund your campaign?</b></p>
<p>We
did our homework, and we  asked ourselves:
would we give someone money just to develop  an idea  they had in mind?</p>
<p>Tricky
question. Maybe.</p>
<p>Let's
try again: would we give money to someone to develop an idea, to get a cup or a
t-shirt with a drawing  by those new
artists they are talking about?</p>
<p>If
it is fair, why not? But we are still not hitting the spot.</p>
<p>Here's
the best answer: regardless ofl the previous scenarios, we would give money  above all to someone who is showing that their
idea is working. That's the point: it  will be more than just words!</p><b>

To do so, we want to offer the
chance to buy a copy of 10 artworks created for Startartist from 10 artists
around the world. We will show that there is a world wide opening to our
approach, and that it is possible to find new talents  at a reasonable price. <span>Indeed copies will be sold during the crowd

<p><b>PRESENTATION  </b></p>
<p>Imagine a place where you can browse through the works of <b>artists</b> from all over the <b>world</b>. A place that brings together photography, illustrations and paintings from all parts of the globe. You’ll think you’ve stumbled on to one of those charcoal sketches you find strolling at Montmartre or prints seen at Soho, or even those elegant and refined drawings discovered in a tiny town in Korea. Now, young artists finally have a large marketplace where they can show their work and where you can purchase it with a <b>authenticity</b> guarantee. </p>
<p>WHAT A SURPRISE!</p>
<p><b>Startartist</b> is the name of this marketplace which is as big as the world, a WEBSITE where emerging artists can find the walls of your home. Discover new artists every month that have passed our selection and have been admitted to the Startartist programme and buy the work that will make your house unique and <b>original</b>.</p>
<br/><p><b>MISSION</b></p>
<p>To present the art of <b>new talented artists</b> to the world.</p>
<p>To nourish artistic culture, starting with the possibility of purchasing the works of emerging artists.</p>
<p>Today’s art trade is a pyramid: few people have the power in this closed market where a limited number of people have access.</p>
<p>Startartist makes its prime objective that of helping art emerge from the most remote corners of the earth and society. It leaves its users the liberty of judging if a work of art or an artist is noteworthy or not.</p>
<p>Startartist wants to create an <b>alternative</b> art market where the artists has the possibility of selling their works, and where every art lover can find authentic works from all over the world. Anyone who makes art must have the opportunity to present their works to be shown. Anyone who loves art must have the possibility of purchasing authentic works.</p>
<p>The goal is to economically nourish artistic culture, starting from the foundations.</p>
<p>For the customer, art can become a form of investment that may even become profitable with time. Buying an original work from an unknown artist could turn out to be a winning venture that is economically remunerative. Tomorrow’s leading artist is surely to be found amongst today’s unknown artists. You need only to find that artist.</p>
<br/><p><b>PHILOSOPHY</b></p>
<p>We have a dream:<b> getting rid of the distance between the public and emerging art.</b> Talented artists scattered over the world are just waiting to be discovered and seen. Startartist is a showcase for works of art where an artist exhibits and promotes his or her work.</p>
<p>The art will be seen even before it has been understood.</p>
<p><b>HOW DOES STARTARTIST WORK?</b></p>
<p><b>Startartist is an online platform for selling works of art.</b></p>
<p>Startartist allows artists from all over the world to sell their work and at the same time, offers those who want to decorate their homes the possibility of finding unique works of art that are certified and signed, with the same price as those found in home furnishings department stores.</p>
<p>The website is the link between customer and artist.</p>
<p>The way it works is simple and clear. First the artists upload the credentials for their work of art on Startartist (photos, title, year, artist’s CV, size, technique used and the number of copies if it is a print) which, after being approved by Startartist art director, are published and made visible to everyone.</p>
<p><b>Art lovers</b> or the simply inquisitive, anyone looking for something unique can consult the works published on the website and buy them instantly by online payment. Startartist charges a percentage for the transactions.</p>
<p>Shipping is done directly between the artist and the customer. The work is rolled up and sent without a frame in a tube. Each work sold on Startartist is signed and certified. For prints or photographs, the artist must declare the number of copies made in order to create limited editions.</p>
<p>Startartist is where you can take a chance on artists who might one day be successful and make a name for themselves in art.</p>

<p><span><b>PRESENTAZIONE</b></span></p>
<p>Immagina un luogo dove poter curiosare tra le opere di artisti provenienti da tutto il mondo, un luogo che raccoglie fotografie, illustrazioni e dipinti che arrivano da ogni parte del globo. Ti sembrerà di scorgere quei carboncini che si trovano passeggiando a Montmartre, o quelle stampe viste a Soho, oppure quei disegni eleganti e raffinati scovati in un paesino in Corea. I giovani artisti hanno finalmente trovato una grande piazza dove poter mostrare i propri lavori e dove tu puoi acquistarli in direttamente da casa e con la garanzia di autenticità e unicità dell’opera.</p>
<p>Startartist è il nome di questa piazza grande come il mondo, un portale online dove gli artisti emergenti incontrano le pareti di casa tua. Scopri ogni mese i nuovi artisti, che hanno superato la selezione e sono stati ammessi al programma Startartist, e acquista l’opera che renderà la tua casa unica e originale.</p>
<p>Startartist è un nuovo progetto che vuole cambiare il modo in cui l'arte viene scoperta e scambiata, in tutto il mondo.</p>
<p><b>MISSION</b></p>
<p>Divulgare l’arte degli artisti sconosciuti al mercato tradizionale dell’arte.</p>
<p>Alimentare la cultura artistica, partendo dalla possibilità di acquistare opere di artisti emergenti. </p>
<p>Il mercato dell’arte oggi è organizzato in modo piramidale: poche persone hanno il potere di stabilire se un artista può e deve vendere. E’ un mercato chiuso, dove un numero limitato di persone hanno accesso.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Il mondo è pieno di Arte. Startartist si pone come obbiettivo quello di fare emergere l’arte dagli angoli più remoti del pianeta e della società. Lasciando agli utenti la libertà di decretare se un opera o un artista è degno di nota o meno. Startartist vuole creare un mercato dell’arte alternativo dove ogni artista ha la possibilità di vendere le proprie opere, e dove ogni amante dell’arte può trovare opere autentiche da ogni parte del mondo. Chiunque fa arte deve poter essere visto. Chiunque ama l’arte deve poter comprare opere autentiche.</span><br/></p>
<p>L’obbiettivo è quello di alimentare anche economicamente la cultura artistica, partendo dalla base.</p>
<p>L’arte può diventare per chi aquista una forma di investimento che col tempo può essere redditizio. Comprare oggi un’ opera originale di un artista sconosciuto potrebbe rivelarsi una scommessa vincente ed economicamente remunerativa. Tra gli artisti sconosciuti di oggi ci sarà l’artista famoso di domani. Basta trovarlo.</p>
<br/><p><b>FILOSOFIA</b></p>
<p>Abbiamo un sogno: annullare la distanza che c’è tra il pubblico e l’arte emergente. Artisti talentuosi sparsi per il mondo aspettano solo di essere scovati e visti. Startartist è una vetrina di opere d’arte dove un artista espone e promuove il proprio lavoro.</p>
<p>L’arte sarà vista ancor prima di essere capita.</p>
<p><b>COME FUNZIONA STARTARTIST?</b></p>
<p>Startartist è una piattaforma on line di vendita di opere d’arte.</p>
<p>Startartist permette agli artisti di tutto il mondo di vendere le loro opere e, nel contempo, offre a chi vuole arredare casa di trovare opere uniche, certificate e firmate, a prezzi che si allineano con quelli di grandi magazzini d’arredamento.</p>
<p>Il sito è il collegamento tra cliente e artista.</p>
<p>Il funzionamento è semplice e chiaro: l’artista carica su Startartist le credenziali delle  proprie opere (foto, titolo, anno, curriculum dell’artista, dimensioni, tecnica usata e numero di copie se si tratta di stampe) che, dopo essere state approvate, vengono pubblicate e rese visibili a tutti.</p>
<p>L’ amante dell’arte, il curioso, chiunque sia alla ricerca di qualcosa di unico consulta le opere pubblicate nel sito e compra istantaneamente attraverso pagamento on line. Startartist trattiene una percentuale sulle transazioni.</p>
<p>La spedizione avviene direttamente tra l’artista e il cliente, l’opera viene spedita non intelaiata e arrotolata in un tubo da spedizioni.</p>
<p>Ogni opera venduta su Startartist è firmata e certificata. Nel caso di stampe o fotografie l’artista è tenuto a dichiarare il numero effettivo di copie.</p>
<p>Startartist è un luogo in cui scommettere su artisti che potrebbero un giorno avere successo ed affermarsi nel mercato dell’arte.</p>
<p><b>DONATORI</b></p>
<p>I donatori possono mandarci la propria foto a <a href=""thanks@startartist.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">thanks@startartist.com</a> . Saranno inseriti in un video di ringraziamento.</p>
<p><b>PERKS</b></p>
<p>Attraverso un contest abbiamo selezionato 10 artisti in tutto il mondo. Abbiamo dato loro un tema sul quale hanno prodotto delle opere specifiche per Startartist. Il tema dato è stato</p>
<p>“All Art is contemporary, the entire world is contemporary”</p>
<p>Art is contemporary as the world that is creating it, Art is a reflection of our time.</p>
<p>Art is an universal language that allows the understanding of different cultures, and nowadays there are no geographical limits when it is time to create, generating a unique connection between cultures.</p>
<p>Tutte le opere sono in formato A4 e riprodotte in numerazione limitata. </p>
<p>Serie limitata (100 cad.)</p>
<p>Le opere saranno stampate su carta di altissima qualità accompagnate dalla certificazione di autenticità.</p>

</div></div>","Startartist is a new project that wants to change the way in which art is discovered and sold all over the world.What do we want Startartist to be:
We
think there is a need for a place where good artists can start selling their
art,  take the first steps into the market
and get noticed all around the world.
We
also think there is a need for a place where people can spot and buy original
artworks at an affordable price, with or without having  trading skills.
We
would like Startartist to be the answer to these needs. We want it to be global
and we want it to be equal.
Why is Startartist different:
There
are plenty of  sites out there where you
can find artists and buy art, but  we’ve
always hadthe impression that you have to pay a lot of money for something
meaningful, or to be extremely gifted to select an artist  from the pile. Furthermore, it’s always seemed to us that, if something
has a reasonable price, somehow there is a trick.
At
Startartist, we’ve got a set of rules in
mind that must  be followed by the artists
 who want to get on board: once you are
in, you will have your display on our platform and you will be ready to sell.
As a customer, you will be able to surf through the database by multiple
criteria,  in line with what you are
looking for. No surprises: simple and equal.
And
 most importantly: you will buy  certified originals from a fresh talented
artist.
Why are we planning a crowd funding campaign?
Crowd
funding such a social idea is a way of testing it, and making people part of
its development. We may sound crazy, but even  if we had the budget, we would be doing exactly
what we are doing.
How do you expect people to fund your campaign?
We
did our homework, and we  asked ourselves:
would we give someone money just to develop  an idea  they had in mind?
Tricky
question. Maybe.
Let's
try again: would we give money to someone to develop an idea, to get a cup or a
t-shirt with a drawing  by those new
artists they are talking about?
If
it is fair, why not? But we are still not hitting the spot.
Here's
the best answer: regardless ofl the previous scenarios, we would give money  above all to someone who is showing that their
idea is working. That's the point: it  will be more than just words!

To do so, we want to offer the
chance to buy a copy of 10 artworks created for Startartist from 10 artists
around the world. We will show that there is a world wide opening to our
approach, and that it is possible to find new talents  at a reasonable price. Indeed copies will be sold during the crowd
funding process, but it will be a limited series that will  forever be the inception of Startartist.PERKSWe held a contest to select 10 artists in the entire world. We gave them a theme on which they produced works of art specifically for Startartist. The theme we gave them was“All Art is contemporary, the entire world is contemporary”                                           Art is contemporary as the world that is creating it, Art is a reflection of our time. Art is a universal language that allows the understanding of different cultures, and nowadays there are no geographical limits when it is time to create, generating a unique connection between cultures.All the works are in A4 format and in a limited number. Limited edition (100 for each).The works will be printed on the highest quality paper and accompanied by authenticity certification. 1) Artist: Jit Chowdhury (India)  
2) Artist: Angela Monteiro (Portugal)
 3) Artist: Fanzilla Luo (China)

     4) Artist: Inés Isaurralde (Argentina) 
    



5) Artist: Karla Sotres (Mexico)



  

6) Artist: Michael
A. Morrison (Australia)








7) Artist: Ernesto Perez (USA)






8) Artist: Ikuko (Japan)





9) Artist: Zohair Salama (Egypt)




10) Artist: Karin and the camera (Italy)

PRESENTATION  
Imagine a place where you can browse through the works of artists from all over the world. A place that brings together photography, illustrations and paintings from all parts of the globe. You’ll think you’ve stumbled on to one of those charcoal sketches you find strolling at Montmartre or prints seen at Soho, or even those elegant and refined drawings discovered in a tiny town in Korea. Now, young artists finally have a large marketplace where they can show their work and where you can purchase it with a authenticity guarantee. 
WHAT A SURPRISE!
Startartist is the name of this marketplace which is as big as the world, a WEBSITE where emerging artists can find the walls of your home. Discover new artists every month that have passed our selection and have been admitted to the Startartist programme and buy the work that will make your house unique and original.
MISSION
To present the art of new talented artists to the world.
To nourish artistic culture, starting with the possibility of purchasing the works of emerging artists.
Today’s art trade is a pyramid: few people have the power in this closed market where a limited number of people have access.
Startartist makes its prime objective that of helping art emerge from the most remote corners of the earth and society. It leaves its users the liberty of judging if a work of art or an artist is noteworthy or not.
Startartist wants to create an alternative art market where the artists has the possibility of selling their works, and where every art lover can find authentic works from all over the world. Anyone who makes art must have the opportunity to present their works to be shown. Anyone who loves art must have the possibility of purchasing authentic works.
The goal is to economically nourish artistic culture, starting from the foundations.
For the customer, art can become a form of investment that may even become profitable with time. Buying an original work from an unknown artist could turn out to be a winning venture that is economically remunerative. Tomorrow’s leading artist is surely to be found amongst today’s unknown artists. You need only to find that artist.
PHILOSOPHY
We have a dream: getting rid of the distance between the public and emerging art. Talented artists scattered over the world are just waiting to be discovered and seen. Startartist is a showcase for works of art where an artist exhibits and promotes his or her work.
The art will be seen even before it has been understood.
HOW DOES STARTARTIST WORK?
Startartist is an online platform for selling works of art.
Startartist allows artists from all over the world to sell their work and at the same time, offers those who want to decorate their homes the possibility of finding unique works of art that are certified and signed, with the same price as those found in home furnishings department stores.
The website is the link between customer and artist.
The way it works is simple and clear. First the artists upload the credentials for their work of art on Startartist (photos, title, year, artist’s CV, size, technique used and the number of copies if it is a print) which, after being approved by Startartist art director, are published and made visible to everyone.
Art lovers or the simply inquisitive, anyone looking for something unique can consult the works published on the website and buy them instantly by online payment. Startartist charges a percentage for the transactions.
Shipping is done directly between the artist and the customer. The work is rolled up and sent without a frame in a tube. Each work sold on Startartist is signed and certified. For prints or photographs, the artist must declare the number of copies made in order to create limited editions.
Startartist is where you can take a chance on artists who might one day be successful and make a name for themselves in art.
WHERE DO THE FUNDS GO ?

With the Crowdfunding campaign we want to invite people to be part of our development. The  fundings will help us to develop our platform.

PRESENTAZIONE
Immagina un luogo dove poter curiosare tra le opere di artisti provenienti da tutto il mondo, un luogo che raccoglie fotografie, illustrazioni e dipinti che arrivano da ogni parte del globo. Ti sembrerà di scorgere quei carboncini che si trovano passeggiando a Montmartre, o quelle stampe viste a Soho, oppure quei disegni eleganti e raffinati scovati in un paesino in Corea. I giovani artisti hanno finalmente trovato una grande piazza dove poter mostrare i propri lavori e dove tu puoi acquistarli in direttamente da casa e con la garanzia di autenticità e unicità dell’opera.
Startartist è il nome di questa piazza grande come il mondo, un portale online dove gli artisti emergenti incontrano le pareti di casa tua. Scopri ogni mese i nuovi artisti, che hanno superato la selezione e sono stati ammessi al programma Startartist, e acquista l’opera che renderà la tua casa unica e originale.
Startartist è un nuovo progetto che vuole cambiare il modo in cui l'arte viene scoperta e scambiata, in tutto il mondo.
MISSION
Divulgare l’arte degli artisti sconosciuti al mercato tradizionale dell’arte.
Alimentare la cultura artistica, partendo dalla possibilità di acquistare opere di artisti emergenti. 
Il mercato dell’arte oggi è organizzato in modo piramidale: poche persone hanno il potere di stabilire se un artista può e deve vendere. E’ un mercato chiuso, dove un numero limitato di persone hanno accesso.
Il mondo è pieno di Arte. Startartist si pone come obbiettivo quello di fare emergere l’arte dagli angoli più remoti del pianeta e della società. Lasciando agli utenti la libertà di decretare se un opera o un artista è degno di nota o meno. Startartist vuole creare un mercato dell’arte alternativo dove ogni artista ha la possibilità di vendere le proprie opere, e dove ogni amante dell’arte può trovare opere autentiche da ogni parte del mondo. Chiunque fa arte deve poter essere visto. Chiunque ama l’arte deve poter comprare opere autentiche.
L’obbiettivo è quello di alimentare anche economicamente la cultura artistica, partendo dalla base.
L’arte può diventare per chi aquista una forma di investimento che col tempo può essere redditizio. Comprare oggi un’ opera originale di un artista sconosciuto potrebbe rivelarsi una scommessa vincente ed economicamente remunerativa. Tra gli artisti sconosciuti di oggi ci sarà l’artista famoso di domani. Basta trovarlo.
FILOSOFIA
Abbiamo un sogno: annullare la distanza che c’è tra il pubblico e l’arte emergente. Artisti talentuosi sparsi per il mondo aspettano solo di essere scovati e visti. Startartist è una vetrina di opere d’arte dove un artista espone e promuove il proprio lavoro.
L’arte sarà vista ancor prima di essere capita.
COME FUNZIONA STARTARTIST?
Startartist è una piattaforma on line di vendita di opere d’arte.
Startartist permette agli artisti di tutto il mondo di vendere le loro opere e, nel contempo, offre a chi vuole arredare casa di trovare opere uniche, certificate e firmate, a prezzi che si allineano con quelli di grandi magazzini d’arredamento.
Il sito è il collegamento tra cliente e artista.
Il funzionamento è semplice e chiaro: l’artista carica su Startartist le credenziali delle  proprie opere (foto, titolo, anno, curriculum dell’artista, dimensioni, tecnica usata e numero di copie se si tratta di stampe) che, dopo essere state approvate, vengono pubblicate e rese visibili a tutti.
L’ amante dell’arte, il curioso, chiunque sia alla ricerca di qualcosa di unico consulta le opere pubblicate nel sito e compra istantaneamente attraverso pagamento on line. Startartist trattiene una percentuale sulle transazioni.
La spedizione avviene direttamente tra l’artista e il cliente, l’opera viene spedita non intelaiata e arrotolata in un tubo da spedizioni.
Ogni opera venduta su Startartist è firmata e certificata. Nel caso di stampe o fotografie l’artista è tenuto a dichiarare il numero effettivo di copie.
Startartist è un luogo in cui scommettere su artisti che potrebbero un giorno avere successo ed affermarsi nel mercato dell’arte.
DONATORI
I donatori possono mandarci la propria foto a thanks@startartist.com . Saranno inseriti in un video di ringraziamento.

We, Marisa and Lisa are two students of the University

exchange project, which is called  „EigenART-Bond.

„EigenART“,

accommodation and catering, visa and flight cost. Even if we will not
reach the full amount, we can use every euro. 


We
thank the Aurovillians for their hospitality, openness and confidence
in our work.


Support
the growth of our project!
Ziele

öffentliche Vorträge im Rahmen der Hochschule geben, in denen wir
unsere Erfahrungen an Studierende weitergeben und sich Interessierte
direkt informieren und bewerben können. Wir werden den nachfolgenden
Studierenden in ihrer Projektplanung und -durchführung begleitend
und unterstützend zur Seite stehen.

Goals

<p>I've been working as an artist for a couple years and as a way to celebrate my last 2 years of work, i have decided to make an artbook.<br/></p>

<p></p>

<br/><h3>What i need to complete this project
</h3>
<h1>
</h1>
<p>I have 70% of the work done so far. I'm finishing up the layout but i
 also need extra time to make even better content based on my last 
sketches (i would like to have about 5 exclusive pieces). That means 
getting to 100 pages !</p>
<p>What comes next ? You ! :D</p>
<p>Every single dollar you'll give will be injected into the project and
 if we get any excess, it will be to fund other artbooks, stories or 
youtube content :)<br/></p>
<p>I have decided on the lower amount required to get this new project 
printed. Here's a rough estimation of how the basic funds will be used</p>
<p><b>• 37% to cover the cost of Printing 50 copies of the artbook<br/></b></p>
<b>
</b><p><b>• 25% to cover shipping and packaging cost</b></p>
<b>
</b><p><b>• 16% to cover fees (paypal, Indie gogo)</b></p>
<b>
</b><p><b>• 22% margin (covers taxes, work time and some extra for future project)</b><br/></p>I
 did my best to lower the cost and offer to all of you various options 
depending of your budget. You can pick between digital artbook or 
physical artbook. You can also get some fancy prints with it and/or even
 get some goodies bag :)<br/><br/>If for some reasons, we can't make it to
 1000$, you'll get your money back and i'll work on the project even 
harder in order for me to launch it again.<br/>Of course, this project 
still needs works in the next weeks ! remember that this page is where 
you can pre-order the book and other perks. They will be deliver in 
February 2016 :)<br/><br/><h3>You have the power !<br/>
</h3>
<p>I already had an artbook printed and sold out last year. My 2013/2014
 edition was entirely funded my me (400$) and i got 26 copies made. 26 
sold ! I want to get to the next level with this book and print a lot 
more, so with your help, i can definitely do something bigger, with more
 content :) <br/></p>
<p>If you like what i do and want to know how i do it, it's the perfect project to pledge for and it's pretty affordable :)</p>
<p>I hope you'll like this project and help me make it happen !</p>

<h3>Risks and Challenges<br/>
</h3>
<p> Like any project, there's always some risks involded. I do have a back up printing company if anything happens with the first one. I also have settle down everything  in case something happens to me and i can't finish the project - you'll be refund entirely. I'm gonna take care of every single aspect of this project but as i said, it's almost  finished so i'm quite sure this will be happening no matter the issues i might face :)</p>
<p>There's some risks and challenges related to stretch goals as i'm currently experience costs/shipping/quantities and various supplies needed. The major risk would be related to scheduling, since i need to wait for the products to be shipped and i need time to complete all homemade rewards. That's why the delivery schedule can be extended. Which basically means, if you pick the artbook reward, you will most likely receive it somewhere in january or february. But if we get to the Original Raffle rewards, 25 of you will receive their artbook somewhere in march (so i can make all the art) I'll keep you posted on the releasing date of course.</p>

<h3>You can't pledge but still want to help ?<br/>
</h3>
<p>I totally understand ! :D you can still do wonders if you simply share this project on your social media websistes or any art forums/place you know there's art lovers.</p>
<p>Commenting about this, sharing the link of this, talking to your friends. Every thing will matter and you could bring someone here that will pledge for this. You can definitely help me without spending any money :)</p>

<h2>A Radio Caravan for Shouting Fire!</h2> <h3>First, what is Shouting Fire?</h3>
<p>Shouting Fire is an independent, international broadcasting collective, born on the playa and inspired by Burning Man. We are dedicated to radical audio expression.  Our goal is the free flow of information, music, art and culture. We seek to connect the community across the globe all year long and spread our values to the world outside of  Burning Man.</p>
<p>We are an open source, non-commercial,  community radio station, operated entirely by volunteers.  Many of us have been bringing you radio in Black Rock City for the last 20 years or so. Currently the collective numbers over 50 people in 10 countries on 4 continents .  We are your friends, neighbours and campmates, we have deep roots on the playa. We are your community.<br/>We bring listeners live broadcasts from Burning Man events and Burning Man inspired events from around the world as well as weekly music and informational programs from Burners across the globe.  We've built a Global Burner Radio Network to keep you connected year round.</p>
<p>At regional events where there is  an existing radio station we collaborate with them and carry their programming.  If there is no radio station, we bring one! We have the equipment to broadcast over FM at the event and stream it to the world over the internet  or at the very least record for later internet broadcast.<br/><br/>We are able to add a very participatory element to an event as we also give people and projects at the burns an additional vehicle to get their stories out to the community.  In addition we have daily slots available for those who want to have their own radio shows. We provide you access to the airwaves.  By streaming the broadcast to the world, we are able to connect Burners across the globe.<br/><br/>In the US we recently brought listeners live broadcasts from SNRG (The Southern Nevada Regional Gathering), Flipside in Texas and Lakes of Fire, The Great Lakes Regional Burn with plans for more in development.  We also brought listeners simulcasts from Burning Seed in Australia and from Radio Free Tankwa at Afrikaburn. In Europe we did live broadcasts from the Burning Man European Leadership Summit in Denmark as well as The Burning Ball in Vienna and in France, Paris Pre-Decompression</p>
<h3>A Radio Caravan!!</h3>
<p>We now want to cover more and more European events and that’s where the Caravan comes into play. Doing radio in the desert or anywhere for that matter, if you don’t have a proper space is not a piece of cake. You need a little shelter from the noise and wind, dust and sand.  Plus the gear generates heat and needs to be kept cool</p>

<p>Enter the mobile radio caravan studio (aka The Caravan of Love).  We traveled to South Africa for Afrikaburn this year to work with our friends at Radio Free Tankwa who gave us the idea.  Our caravan will be based in Europe and be towed to numerous events.<br/>We found and old caravan that is perfect for the job.  Labor to convert it and get it fitted for our needs has been donated.  We are asking for the community for help in buying it paying for the materials.  To make this a reality we need to raise 700 Euros ($785).<br/><br/>Since we are volunteer run and self funded,  all of our radio gear is either donated by collective members  or we use our personal gear. Radio gear is not cheap so any funds raised over the goal will go towards additional gear (speakers, mics, cables, etc).  <br/><br/>Check us out <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/shoutingfire/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">on Facebook</a> and look <a href=""https://shoutingfire.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">at our website located at ShoutingFire.com</a> AND of course tune in.  You can listen on our website (yes we have apps for iOS and Android, links on our site).

A Night to Awaken is a one night only, free, family friendly event where 20-30 light art installations are set throughout Volunteer Park for all to explore. Lusio is not just a celebration of light and sound; Lusio is a chance to playfully explore a delicate and fleeting art form curated directly into the lush nature of the Pacific Northwest.

<br/><br/>Funding Lusio</h3><p><br/>Lusio is not a quick pop up exhibit.

And since a guy raised $55,000 for potato salad, surely we can raise $5000 to help pay the artists ;) <br/> </p><h3>New perks will be added though out the campaign, make sure to check back!</h3><p><br/><strong>Your donations will also go towards Lusio production which includes but is not limited to the following... </strong></p><ul>

A Night to Awaken?​Lusio. A Night to Awaken is a one night only, free, family friendly event where 20-30 light art installations are set throughout Volunteer Park for all to explore. Lusio is not just a celebration of light and sound; Lusio is a chance to playfully explore a delicate and fleeting art form curated directly into the lush nature of the Pacific Northwest. Thousands of people flock to the historic park for a magical evening unlike any other in Seattle.Relax - Wonder - Wander - Play - Explore  
Why Lusio? ​To provide an opportunity for light artists to have their work shown in a public setting. Most light art is shown in a gallery, at a festival, or at a private event.

<h3>MoonShine Bar</h3>
<p>MoonShine Bar is our second The Golden Guy art bar.  Each bar is an interactive, community based art project on it's own.  Last year we built the Crow Bar, a huge success, intense fun with profound encounters .  This year we are inspired by the heavens and the entrepreneurial spirit of back woods distillers.  Our mission is to provide intimate and outrageous lunar connections and conversations by creating a small, but transcendent lunar environment in which we provide fun and inspiring nightly programs.  </p>
<h3>Us</h3>
<p><font>MoonShine Bar is being created by a pod in the WeCharge! (used to be beeCharge!!!) camp.  The camp has a long history of bringing incredible community and experiential art projects to the Playa.  We're artists, performers, builders, servers, organizers and fun lovers.</font></p>
<h3>Your Support</h3>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Practically, your support for MoonShine Bar will</span> go towards building materials, art supplies, and transportation costs to and from the Playa.  More importantly, your support enables us to bring real, serious and down to earth ""lunacy"" to everyone at Burning Man.   </p>
<h3>The Golden Guy and MoonShine Bar</h3>
</div><div>
<p>The Golden Guy is modeled after a small and eclectic neighborhood called Golden Gai bars in Shinjuku, Tokyo.   Each of the bars is only 8’x12’, guaranteeing intimate experiences for all patrons.  Last year we had five bars, this year closer to two dozen, each very offering unique intimate experiences.</p>
<p>MoonShine Bar is inspired by the full moon that will rise the first night of Burning Man.  The bar roof will have a linear opening that tracks the path of the moon through the night sky, lighting the bar with natural moon light.  From the outside,  MoonShine Bar will appear as a backwoods still.  But, when you enter, you step from Black Rock Kentucky to the surface of the moon, looking back at our own planet earth.  If you look closely, you can see the Black Rock Desert. </p>
<p>Throughout the week, MoonShine Bar will be the ""lunacy"" hub, including the MoonShine cocktail, (with real moonshine, of course), moonwalking contests, flat earth theories, toasts to Yuri Gagarin, extra terrestrial DJs, videos, and so much more ...the skies the limit. </p>

Así que ... me prepare.Les fotografié cocinando, cepillándose los dientes, afeitándose, viendo telenovelas. Amarrándose los zapatos, despertándose, trabajando en la oficina.La preparación para el proyecto, de manera sorprendente, desempeña un papel integral en el proyecto actual: contar a mis padres que soy gay alrededor de una mesa, con tres cámaras que disparan a cada cinco segundos.El producto terminado ofrece al espectador una serie de imágenes, cada uno contando una historia diferente de la familia que retratan, la forma en que interactúan los miembros, y en última instancia, un fotógrafo sin velo.para enterarse más acerca de Unveiled. Visita:www.unveiledtheproject.comHace unos meses,  aplique para que mi proyecto fotográfico ‘Unveiled’ tuviese su primera exposición individual en una galería en el centro de Washington DC. Entre cientos fui escogida para tener una exposición abierta al público desde el 4 de noviembre hasta el 17 de de diciembre de de 2016.Hyller Art Space es un espacio de arte sin fines de lucro dedicada a ofrecer artistas como yo oportunidades nuevas para exponer su obra. La Galería me ha ofrecido su espacio y la publicidad para mi primera exposición individual. Pero desafortunadamente, voy a tener que cubrir ciertos costos:-Imprimir Y Enmarcación- Envío de obras de arte desde y hasta Washington DC- Viaje- Alojamiento-Material promocional, tales como libros , tarjetas de presentación.-Comida y otros gastosDespués del lanzamiento de Unveiled he tenido la suerte que haya sido publicado en muchas plataformas internacionales. A través de esto, he tenido a mucha gente alrededor del mundo que me ha contactado para compartirme su historia. Me enorgullece mucho ver como mediante mi historia la gente ha tomado fuerza en su propio proceso de aceptación y hasta algunos han considerado contarles a su propia familia. Después de los lamentables acontecimientos que tuvieron lugar en Orlando, donde 49 personas LGBT perdieron la vida, creo que ahora más que nunca, historias de aceptación deben ser mostradas. Es por esta razón que mi deseo es compartir ‘Unveiled’ en tantas plataformas como sea posible. Además de esta razón sería un sueño mío verlo en una galería. A través de esta campaña de crowdfunding, mi objetivo es recaudar fondos para poder viajar a Washington DC y llevar acabo esta exposición. La campaña se desarrollará durante agosto y Septiembre con el objetivo de recaudar fondos suficientes.Les agradecería mucho cualquier donación hecha, y la amabilidad de compartir con amigos y familiares.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>My name is Lance Turner, and I am an artist living and working in Memphis, TN. I graduated from Memphis College of Art in 2007, and I got my MFA at Savannah College of Art and Design in 2012. I make process based paintings that include the viewer in their narrative. I’m also a portrait painter and a muralist.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of years, I have been showing my work primarily throughout the South.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have been included in the South issue of New American Paintings. </li>
<li>I have created a three room installation as the first Studio Resident at Crosstown Arts in Memphis, TN. The installation was about infinity, and included a room surrounded by a tiled mural, progressively smaller versions of that room, video loops, mirror rooms, and repeating patterns. </li>
<li>I showed an installation at ArtFields in Lake City, SC. It was an installation that was based on the viewer’s perspective. It was made up of lenticular prints, mirrors, and tiled paintings that carried visual movement constantly throughout the space.</li>
<li>I helped paint a mural at the Memphis Brooks Museum of Art with Nosey and Birdcap that was inspired by video games. It remains on display over a year later.</li>
<li>I painted a mural for the Burke Arts Council in Morganton, NC.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have always wanted to reach a national audience with my artwork, and for the first time I have just been presented with the opportunity to work outside of the South.</p>
<p>I was just accepted to go to the Vermont Studio Residency in Johnson, Vermont for 4 weeks starting November 20th. This residency will give me the time and studio space I need to be an artist. I will have a place to focus on new ideas, and work with 3 advisors who happen to be some of my favorite living artists! In this residency, I want to hone in on some of the ideas that I have been working with for the past two years, and make new body of work that is more focused on a clear goal. Although, a large part of it will be to just make art all day, and not have to worry about space and work. </p>
<p>Lately, I have been living in a house with nowhere to put a painting. It has been hard to make paintings because I have to rearrange my living room just to build a canvas. This residency will be a great vacation from that, and I will use my time there to its fullest potential by taking risks as an artist, and possibly making a big mess.</p>
<p>I have cut some of the costs of this program with two scholarships, and I made a first payment. Yet it would be very hard for me to come up with the rest of this money in a month. With your generous support, I will be able to create work in an environment where my only job is to create work. Please help me fund the rest of my tuition in exchange for 8x10 paintings and prints.</p>
<p>Your support will help me fully realize all that this residency has to offer. It will offer a new place and new people to help guide my work to another level, whatever it may be.</p>
<p>Your help will be very much appreciated, and I look forward to sharing my work and progress with you!</p>

• A supporters-only three-hour teleseminar on how to surf our changing landscape of technology, privacy, health, and creative living – an open conversation in which I'll share my research and invite your questions for moderated group discussion.
• A free download of my forthcoming double-disc live album to all supporters.  It's a collection of highlights from some of my strongest sets yet (including Burning Man, Rootwire, and Unitus Festivals), groovier, wilder, and more passionate and dynamic than ever.
• A free pdf eBook from scans of my favorite sketchbook pages, 2004 - 2013.  The chronicle of my development as an artist and illustrator – and many, many deep thoughts scrawled in the margins...
Thank you for your support!




About This Campaign:
Q: What is the difference between a weapon and an instrument? A: How it's used.
Google selected me on the basis of this tweet to be one of the first few thousand people with access to their new wearable computer, which allow me to share my work more fluidly than ever before.  Since I'm dedicated to exploring the intersection of art, science, and spirituality – and since this device is at the center of so many important controversies about our modern age – I want to use this chance to inspire and empower as many people as possible by making my life a work of art...as well as to examine its potential risks and share my findings with the community.

Part of this will come as a series of essays on how Glass fits into the Big Picture of the evolution of life on Earth – and how our sense of self is changing as we become increasingly intimate with our machines.  Hopefully these essays will help a generation of digital natives navigate their world with more care, discernment, wonder, and respect. Here is the first in that series:""The Evolution of Surveillance, Part 1: From Burgess Shale To Google Glass""


Organizing my thoughts for The Long-Delayed Book!
I'm also working on a series of firsthand views into my life as an acoustic-electronic musician, live painter, and awestruck naturalist – as well as the work of other inspiring people:
Message To Your Future Self, Part 3: Burning Man 2013Projecting Through Glass onto stage at Gratifly 2013 (video by Morphis Art)
Rootwire 2013 Live Art Mural Through Glass
And I'm wide open to YOUR ideas for what I could be doing with Glass.  If you have a question you want answered or a perspective you want explored, email me and I'll try and find a way to work it into this campaign.
The money I'm trying to raise is just enough to cover the costs I incurred to pick up the Glass in New York ($1600 for the device, $800 to make the one-week trip) and have just enough left over to to help with bills so I can publish my best work yet for free.
Please support this project with your donations if you can.  Even if you're as broke as I am you can still help by sharing it (share buttons above!) with anyone who believes in technology's potential to empower and not merely enslave us. Thank you for your support!

The Perks
In addition to various interactive offerings (including first-person guitar and art lessons, private concerts, and original artwork) I have a ton of art for people who support this campaign.

For three months this summer, I will be working in a landscape architecture and urban design firm in the Swiss pre-alps. I will be spending weekends painting in the town of Rougemont, with trips to Bern, Paris, Milan, and other cities. As I travel, I will document urban and rural scenes, with a focus on the intersections of public and private space.  I love to sketch and photograph, but nothing is more satisfying to me than to paint on site.

<p>An environmental art installation consisting of 1000 paper birds to hang in the Bokeo forest.</p>
<p>Acting as protection, and a reminder that all created things are impermanent.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Buddhism, the relationship between culture and ecology is integral to its teachings.</p>
<p>Buddhist teachings give rise to an environmental ethic, with concern for nature; of which man is part. The relationship between culture and ecology can be found in much Buddhist scripture. It is this concept which has informed the creation of this installation. The monks and nuns who live in close proximity to nature stress that care and goodwill should be shown to plants and trees. Buddhists see the forest as one of their closest connections to the teachings of Buddha; who it is believed was born, enlightened and passed away under a tree.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Buddhism emphasizes ecological values through a compassion for all beings, or all forms of life. Buddhism views people as part of nature and this realisation that we are all connected to each other and not separate from nature is a solution which should enable us to live a life in harmony with nature. By abusing the environment we in turn abuse ourselves. Therefore pursing peaceful actions rather than harmful ones, leads to all entities benefitting. This prevailing mindset promotes peaceful action all the time. If every entity is dependent on and connected to another, then only beneficial actions and events can lead to better ways of living for all. Recognising and accepting this mindset can help to heal the environmental injuries of the past. Buddhism provides a different approach and atones for the broken relationship between humanity and nature.</p>
<p>When we integrate our beliefs, values and ideas into our behavior, we bring them alive and give them power and influence over the world. But if we see ourselves as separate from the world, it’s easy to dismiss our actions as irrelevant or unlikely to make a difference to the world as a whole.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Birds4Laos</strong> is a forest installation that explores the theme of integration – how we are connected to nature, to each other. It also deals with ‘anicca’ or impermanence - symbolized in Buddhism by such rituals as the beautiful and colourful sand mandalas that are created by monks, only to be ritualistically destroyed. Representing the Buddhist belief in the transitory nature of material life. Change, therefore is inevitable, forms change due to aging, decay or decomposure. Change is undeniable and truthful to our existence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The installation of<strong> Birds4Laos</strong> will see one thousand white origami cranes hanging in the Bokeo forest. The Bokeo Forest is a protected nature reserve in northern Laos. White birds appear in many myths and cultures as symbols of peace, happiness and good luck. According to Japanese folklore, cranes can also live for one thousand years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The practice of making one thousand origami paper cranes is also very much tied in with meditation and mindfulness, via the very process of creating the birds whilst simultaneously observing both the ever changing sensations within and the nature of transience itself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This project takes the themes of connectedness and impermanence, to create an installation to hang in the trees. You can become involved in the Birds4Laos piece by dedicating a paper crane. Supporting this project will mean that a beautiful paper crane is hung in the Bokeo forest – with biodegradable materials of course. For $5 a name will be added to a bird. Acting as a memorial to remember those we love and have not forgotten. Because of the impermanent nature of this project, we are reminded of the importance to accept that everything will eventually pass and we should aim to not become attached in a way which causes us suffering. Creating this installation with prior knowledge of its imminent demise is a liberating feeling.</p>
<p>The gradual fading of the birds as they are washed away by rain, or fall naturally acts as a metaphor for life in general.</p>
<p>Images of your birds will be sent to all those who take part.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Birds4Laos</strong>, then is about nature, impermanence, change, decay, participation.</p>
<p>The temporal nature of these ephemeral birds is where the inherent beauty of the installation lies. We must accept and appreciate that there is no static being; change and movement rule the universe.</p>
<p>Choose the name of a loved one, present or absent. The one thousand birds will become a memorial.</p>
<p>Without needing to adopt a new religion, just recognizing and accepting this mindset we are elevated to a higher level of consciousness which enables us to live in equanimity concerning nature. We must realize that we are not separate from our environment. We are all interrelated and reliant on one another.</p>

<h2><strong>My name is Sarah Adams.</strong></h2>
<p>I'm a standup comedian, a visual artist, an ex-pastry chef, and a working single mom of two. I love my family, I love making things, and I love comedy. </p>
<p>I perform standup, sketch comedy, and improv theatre regularily, and I've opened for the likes of Todd Barry, Neil Hamburger, Tim Heidecker, and Natasha Leggero. I adore the strange pursuit of making others laugh. My comedy activities can be found at <a href=""http://www.saraghadams.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.saraghadams.com</a>. </p>
<p>Before comedy, I maintained an active visual arts practice - exhibiting and writing about contemporary art within the Canadian art community. Evidence of my visual art activities can easily be found by googling ""Sarah Adams-Bacon"".</p>
<p>I also ran a cake business for a while. This information is relevant once we get to the ""perks"" section.</p>
<p>My current focus is on finding a way to meld my comedy pursuits and my art practice together. I'm especially intrigued with how art and comedy relate to one another. Generally speaking, art - on its surface - is quite somber, yet rather absurd at its core. Comedy, inversely, comes across as silly on its exterior, yet is often based in weighted darkness. I'm curious where the two meet. I feel that when they do meet, brilliance occurs. Beauty, sincerity, absurdity, tragedy. Hilarious. Hilarious.</p>
<p>These things considered, I was thrilled when The Banff Centre announced the <em>24 Experimental Comedy Training Camp</em>, facilitated by Michael Portnoy with guests Mai Abu ElDahab, Steven Johnson, and Reggie Watts. This is exactly what I'd been looking for: a way to actively, intensely consolodate my visual art and comedy practices.</p>
<p>It's a 40-day residency, from September 10 - October 26, 2012. Up until this point, having two young children, residencies have not been something I've been able to participate in. The people I love supported my application to the program, and my mother offered child care assistance. I applied in early spring.</p>
<p>I was accepted. I recieved confirmation just over a month after granting deadlines had passed, however.</p>
<p>Total costs for the program are <a href=""http://www.banffcentre.ca/programs/program.aspx?id=1218&amp;p=fees"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""residency costs"">$5209</a>. Happily, I qualified for 50% funding by The Banff Centre. I am seeking funds to cover the remaining 50%, as well as enough funds to cover 2 months rent while I am away, as I will be away from work during this time.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>My funding needs are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>$2600 - remaining 50% of program tuition</li>
<li>$2200 - two months rent while I'm away</li>
<li>TOTAL ASK: $4800</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>What You'll Get</h3>
<p>Aside from my undying love and everlasting appreciation, I've listed several great perks. I'll take care of you! Art! Cookies! Cakes! Wonderful things!</p>
<p>Please be sure to watch the video and view the gallery to get a better idea of what I'm offering :)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>1. Up until now, I've never had the chance to develop my art career via formal residencies. Because I've been busy supporting my family, I've passed up several opportunities. This program carries post-secondary accredation and melds my two passions incredibly. This is a valuable chance for me to enrich my career as an artist and a comedian.</p>
<p>2. This residency emphasizes comedy as an art form, and I hope to extend the value of it by taking the theme onto the road afterwards. I want to initiate a cross-Canada experimental comedy tour in the summer of 2013. I will attempt to extend thanks to everyone who contributed to this campaign by performing in your cities.</p>
<p>3. If I'm not able to reach my goal, every contribution still helps me immensely, and all funds will still go towards the residency. I will seek out a loan to cover the remaining funds.</p>
<p>4. If I somehow exceed my goal, all funds beyond $4800 will go directly to my 2013 Canadian experimental comedy tour, and you'll all definitely be seeing me next year!</p>

Coming
February 18-22, 2015, OUTsider is a multi-arts queer festival and conference
based in Austin, TX that celebrates the bold originality and creative
nonconformity of the LGBTQI and Ally communities through the presentation of
provocative, overlooked and out-of-the-box film, theater, dance, music,
writing, performance art, visual art and scholarship. Through its annual
festival and conference, OUTsider will join together queer artists, audiences
and scholars from around the globe to exchange ideas, ignite conversations,
transcend boundaries and experience new pleasures through artistic discovery.OUTsider
breaks the traditional one-medium festival model through a mixed-up multi-arts
experience that bridges disciplines in order to activate the full power
and brilliance of LGBTQIA creation and community. 
OUTsider
rejects the common separation of artistic practice and appreciation through an
intertwined festival and conference that encourages meaningful, galvanizing interactions
between artists, scholars and the general public.
OUTsider believes in the power of new forms of art and
community, and stands in solidarity with all outsiders everywhere.

The OUTsider TeamOur Track Record
OUTsider
is a new festival, but we already have a number of successful events under our
glitter belts and combat boots, including MayDayGayDay, a mixed-up night of springtime frolics that featured artists turned
upside down and inside OUT, performing in totally new mediums for the very first
time (filmmakers danced, punk rockers painted, installation artists
sang, and so on down the joyously jumbled line). 
This
event was well-attended and highly-praised by folks of all stripes and predilections,
and gave audiences a palpable sense of our cross-disciplinary ambitions, as
well as a little taste of the artistic mischief that we have in store. Our Team
OUTsider
boasts a rock star team who bring a wealth of festival expertise and creative accomplishment
to the OUTsider buffet.

<p><strong>I dont know if you are aware but obesity is killing our families BUT we can save our own family!! </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Art of Capoeira Transforming the Life of Son and Mothe</strong><strong>r.</strong></p>
<p>We are excited to include you in this wonderful opportunity to support my son, Michael Perdomo and I, Sol Perdomo in traveling to Brazil to participate in the Power of Capoeira. Different towns from Brazil are coming together to celebrate annual Capoeira events in which Capoeiristas will be competing for ranks. From August 17th through the 27th, the group which we are part of Abada Capoeira NYC; will be going to Brazil on a Delegation that will give us the opportunity to share the language classes, baking classes, capoeira, sustainable arts and crafts, and cultural celebrations.</p>
<p>This will be my family’s first time visiting Brazil after becoming part of the big family of Abada Capoeira. Some of my family members where suffering obesity and my oldest son of three, Michael was 85 pounds overweight at the age of 12. I was working as a home attendant and I did not have a lot of time to help my son to lose weight. One day I chose to make my family’s health a priority. My son’s doctor recommended capoeira and I enrolled my son; after which I decided to join my son in his capoeira efforts. Additionally, his other two younger brothers who were overweight joined the class. Due to my family’s struggle with finances I decided to do a course on pastries and today I divide my time between baking, home attendant and bringing my son to every capoeira class.

The Art of Capoeira Transforming the Life of Son and Mother.
We are excited to include you in this wonderful opportunity to support my son, Michael Perdomo and I, Sol Perdomo in traveling to Brazil to participate in the Power of Capoeira. Different towns from Brazil are coming together to celebrate annual Capoeira events in which Capoeiristas will be competing for ranks. From August 17th through the 27th, the group which we are part of Abada Capoeira NYC; will be going to Brazil on a Delegation that will give us the opportunity to share the language classes, baking classes, capoeira, sustainable arts and crafts, and cultural celebrations.
This will be my family’s first time visiting Brazil after becoming part of the big family of Abada Capoeira. Some of my family members where suffering obesity and my oldest son of three, Michael was 85 pounds overweight at the age of 12. I was working as a home attendant and I did not have a lot of time to help my son to lose weight. One day I chose to make my family’s health a priority. My son’s doctor recommended capoeira and I enrolled my son; after which I decided to join my son in his capoeira efforts. Additionally, his other two younger brothers who were overweight joined the class. Due to my family’s struggle with finances I decided to do a course on pastries and today I divide my time between baking, home attendant and bringing my son to every capoeira class. Thanks to the Art of Capoeira the total sum of my family’s weight loss is over 200 pounds!

<p>L’exposition <strong>Chimères</strong> présente trente-six photographies extraites d’une série de reportages autour des Arts de la Scène, réalisés par <strong>Mara De Sario</strong> depuis 2009.</p>
<p>Autour de son travail de vagabondage scénique Mara nous dévoile des histoires qui vont au-delà de la simple commande photographique. Nourrie par la liberté que lui procure son travail, elle capte des sentiments impalpables, presque subliminaux avec un regard de photographe affûté, sensible et subjectif. Ses images sont des sentiments, des rencontres, des moments privilégiés avec des artistes de tous bords qui exultent, rêvent ... Chaque cliché raconte des histoires d’hommes et de femmes, transcendés, métamorphosés par leur performance ou dans l’abandon de soi ; l’expression de leurs corps nous dévoile des personnages à la fois poétiques, étranges et subliminaux.</p>
<p>Aujourd’hui, Mara décide d’accrocher cette histoire sur les murs. L’envie de partager avec le public cette aventure scénique et vagabonde. Parce que la création d’une œuvre ne peut exister que si elle est partagée auprès du grand public. Pour un artiste c’est une nouvelle mise à nu, à la fois effrayante et excitante !</p>

<p>Le projet de Mara est de faire voyager son travail dans plusieurs lieux, tout en poursuivant son travail de photographe autour des arts de la scène.

<strong>Présentation de l’artiste : </strong><strong>Mara De Sario – Photographe.</strong>
</h3>
<p>Originaire des Hauts Pays, Mara dés son plus jeune âge est attiré par l’image et dévore la bibliothèque familiale. À 16 ans, elle décide de prendre des cours du soir afin d’apprendre les techniques photographiques, avant de poursuivre sa formation à <strong>l’Institut des hautes Etudes des Communications Sociales</strong> (IHECS Bruxelles) et à <strong>l’Ecole de Recherche Graphique</strong> (ERG Bruxelles.) dont elle sort diplômée. Attirée par les arts de la scène et ces petits moments de la vie, Mara développe au travers de son parcours pluridisciplinaire une approche documentaire, artistique et narrative de la photographie.</p>
<p>Depuis 2004, Mara couvre plusieurs événements culturels dont entre autres : « <strong>Festival européen des écoles de cirque de Honnelles</strong>, <strong>Festival du Court Métrage</strong> (Bruxelles), <strong>BE Film Festival</strong> (Bruxelles), <strong>ProsVia</strong> (Mons), <strong>Festival International du Film d’Amour </strong>(Mons), <strong>Festival International du Film Francophone</strong> (Namur), <strong>Festival Ciné32 – Indépendance(s) et Création</strong>, Auch (France). Depuis 2009, Mara est <strong>« Artistes Associés de la Compagnie du Plat pays ! Asbl ».</strong> Elle poursuit sa collaboration avec plusieurs troupes de cirques, de théâtre, de musique dont « L’Acteur et l’écrit de Fréderic Dussene », le « cirque Farrago », le groupe de musique <strong>« Moon Hop »</strong> (Bordeaux) et <strong>«</strong> <strong>Antoine Hénaut »</strong> (Belgique) pour l’album <strong>« 36.000 </strong>». En 2013, entre divers spectacles, et la préparation de l’exposition <strong>« Chimères »</strong> Mara couvre le Tribunal Russell pour la Palestine en présence de <strong>Roger Waters</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong><em>La structure de production en quelques mots : </em></strong></h3>
<p>L’ASBL<strong> Compagnie du Plat pays !</strong>  <strong><em>« </em></strong><strong><em>Association d’artistes, de production artistique des Arts et Arts de la scène ».</em></strong>  Elle se consacre depuis 2005, à accompagner des artistes, auteurs, interprètes dans la réalisation de leurs projets, avec expertise, engagement et humour. Elle est née d’une envie de rassembler, de mêler les arts en les sortant de leur cadre ordinaire et d’échanger avec tous les milieux artistiques comme le cirque, la danse, le théâtre, l’audiovisuel, la musique, les arts plastiques et l’artisanat. En prenant à cœur l’engagement de l’artiste et sa position au sein de la société, la compagnie présente des pratiques, des styles artistiques variés en faisant des choix avec une nette préférence pour les thèmes sociaux, elle contribue à sa façon à la recherche d’une conscience, d’un dialogue, d’une identité culturelle. Elle s’est forgé une reconnaissance auprès des publics et programmateurs en traversant les frontières de la Belgique, se produisant notamment en France, en Suisse, en Espagne, en Hollande et au Canada.</p>
<p>Le projet de l’association se fonde sur une dynamique de recherche de synergies et de mutualisation des moyens au profit du travail artistique.De tout temps, la réalisation de créations artistiques a nécessité talent, inspiration, travail et une bonne dose de rêves, de risques, de folies et de passions. Il y a tout un chemin parcouru entre la naissance d’une idée et l’aboutissement d’une œuvre quelle que soit sa forme finale</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Yanai and I am an Art student at Miami Dade College in Miami, Fl. I work and study full time and still have managed to keep my GPA at 3.83. I was recently accepted into my college's Study Abroad Program. From all destinations I picked Florence to take Art History and Drawing because it is the city of the fine arts by excellence, it is rich in history and as an art student, living and studying there for a few months will be an experience hard to equal. It will challenge my creativity, improve my drawing skills and develop my artistic abilities, and significantly increase my knowledge about art. I will be studying at Lorenzo de' Medici Institute: <a href=""http://www.lorenzodemedici.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.lorenzodemedici.org/</a></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My goal is to raise $10,000 to take full advantage of this opportunity. Besides my classes, I will start a project to document my trip. I will be making sketches, drawings, and photographs of my daily experiences and there is where you come in. <em><strong>Your contribution will be entirely used to make this project a reality</strong></em>. I need to purchase art materials, a portable computer. I also need to cover the expenses incurred in traveling for my research, and the shipping costs of sending your reward.</p>
<p>Your rewards:</p>
<p>You will have the chance to own pieces of the FIRST EDITION OF THE FIRST COLLECTION I ever made. Of course I have made other drawings but they are mostly class assignments or practices with the purpose of teaching me certain techniques. In this trip I will do my very own creative art project <strong><em>and you will have some of the artwork!!!!</em></strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>I am a low income student studying in a public college. My current earnings and Financial Aid are not enough to cover all my educational expenses nor my extra curricular activities including studying abroad, volunteer work or materials for my projects. Therefore, <strong><em>your support will have a significant impact in the achievement of my success.</em></strong></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Studying abroad will not only enrich my artistic portfolio, it would also build more solid roots for my future career. I have been seriously thinking of Art History as a minor and visiting Florence will be crucial for me to make the final decision.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">After the summer term, I will be ready to transfer to the upper division to complete my education. The major in Fine Arts requires a portfolio review in which the school evaluates the students' talent and skills. It is crucial for me to build a professional and consistent portfolio that impress the jurors. The drawings I need to build the portfolio will be made in this trip. It will include the best drawings of my project!!</p>
<p>My project is NOT one of those that can't be done if the full amount is not raised. If I don't get the full amount I need,<strong> <em>your contribution won't be spent in anything but the project and in the development of my artistic skills</em></strong>. I'll still use the amount raised to buy art materials, but maybe I won't be able to make as many drawings as I want to. I'll be limited to draw until the materials are exhusted. I won't be able to travel to the outskirts of Florence to meet the authentic Italians either, as it is my desire. I believe I can make more interesting and powerful drawings of the people in the little towns than from people in the city. Traveling is <span style=""font-size: xx-small;"">essential</span> to stimulate artists creativity.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't help me with money, don't feel bad yet!! YOU STILL CAN HELP!!! Spread the voice, send it to your friends, post it on facebook, twitter, and other social networks. I am very grateful for any kind of support.</p>
<p>Thank you. Gracias. G<span>razie.</span></p>

<div> </div></div>","Short Summary
My name is Yanai and I am an Art student at Miami Dade College in Miami, Fl. I work and study full time and still have managed to keep my GPA at 3.83. I was recently accepted into my college's Study Abroad Program. From all destinations I picked Florence to take Art History and Drawing because it is the city of the fine arts by excellence, it is rich in history and as an art student, living and studying there for a few months will be an experience hard to equal. It will challenge my creativity, improve my drawing skills and develop my artistic abilities, and significantly increase my knowledge about art. I will be studying at Lorenzo de' Medici Institute: http://www.lorenzodemedici.org/


What I Need & What You Get
My goal is to raise $10,000 to take full advantage of this opportunity. Besides my classes, I will start a project to document my trip. I will be making sketches, drawings, and photographs of my daily experiences and there is where you come in. Your contribution will be entirely used to make this project a reality. I need to purchase art materials, a portable computer. I also need to cover the expenses incurred in traveling for my research, and the shipping costs of sending your reward.
Your rewards:
You will have the chance to own pieces of the FIRST EDITION OF THE FIRST COLLECTION I ever made. Of course I have made other drawings but they are mostly class assignments or practices with the purpose of teaching me certain techniques. In this trip I will do my very own creative art project and you will have some of the artwork!!!!


The Impact
I am a low income student studying in a public college. My current earnings and Financial Aid are not enough to cover all my educational expenses nor my extra curricular activities including studying abroad, volunteer work or materials for my projects. Therefore, your support will have a significant impact in the achievement of my success.
Studying abroad will not only enrich my artistic portfolio, it would also build more solid roots for my future career. I have been seriously thinking of Art History as a minor and visiting Florence will be crucial for me to make the final decision.
After the summer term, I will be ready to transfer to the upper division to complete my education. The major in Fine Arts requires a portfolio review in which the school evaluates the students' talent and skills. It is crucial for me to build a professional and consistent portfolio that impress the jurors. The drawings I need to build the portfolio will be made in this trip. It will include the best drawings of my project!!
My project is NOT one of those that can't be done if the full amount is not raised. If I don't get the full amount I need, your contribution won't be spent in anything but the project and in the development of my artistic skills. I'll still use the amount raised to buy art materials, but maybe I won't be able to make as many drawings as I want to. I'll be limited to draw until the materials are exhusted. I won't be able to travel to the outskirts of Florence to meet the authentic Italians either, as it is my desire. I believe I can make more interesting and powerful drawings of the people in the little towns than from people in the city. Traveling is essential to stimulate artists creativity.


Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't help me with money, don't feel bad yet!! YOU STILL CAN HELP!!! Spread the voice, send it to your friends, post it on facebook, twitter, and other social networks. I am very grateful for any kind of support.
Thank you. Gracias. Grazie.

<p>In September of 2011, through our children’s teachers, we learned that the Flint Community Schools eliminated the art education program and budget for all elementary levels schools.  As concerned citizens and parents, my husband and I decided to volunteer to teach art at Eisenhower Elementary, with the principal’s permission.  The program we created is completely voluntary and the teachers are under no obligation to invite us into their classrooms, but every teacher in the building consistently welcomes us into their rooms with complete enthusiasm.  Since the beginning of the school year we have utilized teacher input to develop a program that both the students enjoy and that works with their existing curriculum. </p>
<p>We encourage students to use art as a coping mechanism as well as a learning tool.  Our projects focus on fine motor skill development through scissor and controlled brush use.  We have also made it a point to include a variety of tools including compasses, rulers, and protractors that the students will need an understanding of as they progress in grade level.  We have also hosted several art based events in the school including our Art in Real Life event in January 2012 where we partnered with nine local artists of different mediums, including the Dean of Fine Arts from Mott Community College, who volunteered their time to show students their work and the tools they use to create it.  This event was broadcast on WNEM evening news. </p>
<p>One of the sixth grade classes was given an amazing opportunity to work with Flint Comix.  The students, as a group, wrote a complete comic story for Flint Comix’s The Spark character that was drawn and inked by Brian Hackney.  The students discussed sequential art and watched the comic development process from penciling, to inking, to computer touches, and then finally published in the January 2012 issue with their names as authors.  We have also collaborated with Mott Community College, The Creative Alliance, Pages Bookstore, and were honored to host a performance by the University of Michigan’s Dance for Schools Program. </p>
Unfortunately, the majority of our supplies currently come from our family income, limiting what projects we are able to do with the students.  We are reaching out to the community to help us raise funds for supplies for our soon to be 700 students for the 2012-2013 school year.  All donations will go towards keeping art in the elementary schools in Flint, MI through supplies like colored pencils, glue, molding clay, paint, brushes, canvases, etc.<br/> </div></div>","In September of 2011, through our children’s teachers, we learned that the Flint Community Schools eliminated the art education program and budget for all elementary levels schools.  As concerned citizens and parents, my husband and I decided to volunteer to teach art at Eisenhower Elementary, with the principal’s permission.  The program we created is completely voluntary and the teachers are under no obligation to invite us into their classrooms, but every teacher in the building consistently welcomes us into their rooms with complete enthusiasm.  Since the beginning of the school year we have utilized teacher input to develop a program that both the students enjoy and that works with their existing curriculum.

<p><strong>BENEFITS OF RESIDENCY &amp; MOTIVATION<br/><br/></strong>Back in 2008 after winning an award for Best Mixed Media at the Toronto Outdoor Art Exhibition, I embarked on a mission to my homeland in search of my roots. That trip was the first time I have visited as a practicing artist and it has influenced the trajectory of my work until now. Recently being invited to exhibit at the Art Gallery of Ontario, my artistic practice is reaching a new level and I feel the need re-invigorate this inspiration I felt with this residency.

I feel that as a Filipino raised abroad, my perspective is unique for this type of exchange. </p>

<p><em>Photo by Vuk Dragojevic</em><br/><br/>BIOGRAPHY</p>
<p>I am a Filipino-Canadian artist and work in a diverse range of media including collage, screen printing, installation, fashion, food, workshops, the internet, and performative athletics. My process involves the collecting, sorting and patterning of found ephemera. Known for my large scale installations and happenings, I'm interested in bringing people together through colour and energy. I have exhibited extensively in Canada and had solo exhibitions in Tokyo and Kyoto Japan where I explored my interest in healing power methods and mystics. I recently exhibited in <strong>The Art Gallery of Ontario’s Massive Party</strong>. With the theme of ‘Gold’, I created an extravagant Filipino-Baroque jungle featuring glittering costumes, and signature ‘Psych Bike Caravan’. I am a self-taught artist also known for my collaborative teaching methods and experimental residencies. I was the founder of Halo Halo Village  (2009-2012), an exploratory impulse studio specializing in screen printing and experimental workshops. <strong>I continue to work extensively with students of all age groups at Seneca College, Sheridan College, Ontario College of Art &amp; Design, The Art Gallery Of Ontario, Artscape, and I am also featured in The Royal Ontario Museum.</strong></p>
<p>I am also a marathon runner and culinary artist. I use performative running groups, long distance races and Hot Pot Workshops to bring people together to celebrate health. Internationally known as Mango Peeler, my art, fashion and video have also been attracting commissions and collaborations from celebrities such as Drake, October’s Very Own, Josephine Foster, R.Kelly, and Diplo.</p>

Canadian-Filipino artist, teacher, and marathon runner MANGO PEELER (Jepoy Garcia) embarks on a journey to his roots in the Philippines. During his artist residency he will bring together arts and athletics with the local youth and surfers on a Secret Island, and bring the journey back home to Canada.
Pre-selected as the first international artist for this NOMADIC ARTIST-IN-RESIDENCE PROGRAM IN THE PHILIPPINES by The Unifiedfield.

From my Jungle Program to my Space Travel Program, I teach kids that the world is round and colourful. They always remind me that travel keeps us young and our imaginations fresh.
For 3 years I have been part of the Visiting Artist Program at Children's art studio and have been creating exciting work with children from ages 3-7 years old. The funds will go to the studio so Lynn Jackson (Director) can continue her  positive and innovative programming for youth.
*** 10% of the funds raised I will donate to Children's Art Studio at Artscape Wychwood Barns in Toronto, Canada. ***

BENEFITS OF RESIDENCY & MOTIVATIONBack in 2008 after winning an award for Best Mixed Media at the Toronto Outdoor Art Exhibition, I embarked on a mission to my homeland in search of my roots. That trip was the first time I have visited as a practicing artist and it has influenced the trajectory of my work until now. Recently being invited to exhibit at the Art Gallery of Ontario, my artistic practice is reaching a new level and I feel the need re-invigorate this inspiration I felt with this residency. I am very interested in the cultural and artistic exchange with the local communities in the Philippines and bringing back the journey and knowledge to my students here in Canada.  I also feel the combination of collaborative art making and athletics is an integral part of the future of art education. This residency will allow us the opportunity to expand and unify our international communities. I feel that as a Filipino raised abroad, my perspective is unique for this type of exchange.

I am a Filipino-Canadian artist and work in a diverse range of media including collage, screen printing, installation, fashion, food, workshops, the internet, and performative athletics. My process involves the collecting, sorting and patterning of found ephemera. Known for my large scale installations and happenings, I'm interested in bringing people together through colour and energy. I have exhibited extensively in Canada and had solo exhibitions in Tokyo and Kyoto Japan where I explored my interest in healing power methods and mystics. I recently exhibited in The Art Gallery of Ontario’s Massive Party. With the theme of ‘Gold’, I created an extravagant Filipino-Baroque jungle featuring glittering costumes, and signature ‘Psych Bike Caravan’. I am a self-taught artist also known for my collaborative teaching methods and experimental residencies. I was the founder of Halo Halo Village  (2009-2012), an exploratory impulse studio specializing in screen printing and experimental workshops. I continue to work extensively with students of all age groups at Seneca College, Sheridan College, Ontario College of Art & Design, The Art Gallery Of Ontario, Artscape, and I am also featured in The Royal Ontario Museum.
I am also a marathon runner and culinary artist. I use performative running groups, long distance races and Hot Pot Workshops to bring people together to celebrate health. Internationally known as Mango Peeler, my art, fashion and video have also been attracting commissions and collaborations from celebrities such as Drake, October’s Very Own, Josephine Foster, R.Kelly, and Diplo.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>On the 4th of July weekend, 2011, Xingularity first rose from the ground and arched up towards the sky.</p>
<p><img align=""right"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://vibrata.com/xingularity/gatelessGate.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>It all started as a small sculpture called the Gateless Gate, and a crazy idea that such a thing could be built on a large enough scale to walk through. It was designed in Adobe Illustrator and the pieces cut out with a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cnc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title=""CNC"">CNC</a>. Last year, when the 2011 Burning Man theme, ""Rites of Passage"", was announced, that word ""Passage"" was a catalyst towards that vision. Robert Bell (creator of <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/Zonotopia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 87); text-decoration: none;"" target="""" title=""Zonotopia"">Zonotopia</a>) was the other catalyst, as his mind-blowing 2010 playa installation made it all suddenly seem possible.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>From Vibrata: ""I've been working with a friend who uses a CNC cutter for making commercial signs and such. It was a steep learning curve for me but I loved the resulting sculptures. The inspiration to create something really big and interactive hovered over my head until May, when the call for art proposals for the <a href=""http://priceless.false-profit.com/art/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title=""False Profit Priceless"">False Profit Priceless</a> campout was sent out. It was like being shot out of a cannon.""<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img align=""left"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://vibrata.com/xingularity/windoracle-night.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>Vibrata and I have created large scale art pieces together at Burning Man before. Our first was <a href=""http://vibrata.com/wind_oracle.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title=""the Wind Oracle"">the Wind Oracle</a>, a mixed media kinetic installation in 2003, which went back to the playa as well as Decompression 2005. In 2006, I assisted her in creating the Rose Window, the crowning piece of the Connexus Cathedral project. We've also contributed art to previous Priceless campouts; last year with ""Past, Present, Future Perfect"".</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The Priceless campout is held in Belden, California, in a layout that includes a huge dance area with a wooded trail about 100 yards long leading to a small beach. Xingularity was proposed as a passageway that people would walk through to go between the main dance area and the beach. It would create a transition point, and lend a momentousness to the entering and exiting.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Production was swift, from the moment of beginning the design, to finding a new CNC connection in Robert Bell (creator of <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/Zonotopia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title=""Zonotopia"">Zonotopia</a>), to cutting the shapes, painting and transporting to Belden. In the midst of it there were redesigns, a 1/3 scale model was hatched, and a freak rainstorm nearly derailed the final preparations. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Once in Belden, the pieces were sorted, the volunteers were briefed, and assembly took 4 1/2 hours. Not bad, considering none of us had ever done anything like it before!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img align=""left"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://vibrata.com/xingularity/xingularity.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>...And it was quite spectacular. It was more than a way to get from one area to another, it was a place to stop a talk, a place to dance. Lighting gave the piece an otherworldliness that we couldn't have predicted. The response was overwhelmingly and enthusiastically positive!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We learned a lot in the process. The uneven ground made it challenging to line up the pieces properly. Some of the pieces were damaged during assembly, some by people who thought it was for climbing. We knew that in order to build it on the playa, we would need new lights. The ones we had were gorgeous, but old and unreliable, not to mention heavy on power usage. We also knew that with a bit more money, we could add more pieces and make the structure larger.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>It also needed a new name. Originally it was titled, ""Priceless Passage"". Building it on the playa seemed to warrant a name that doesn't include ""Priceless"". Vibrata researched a little into ideas around wormholes, those beguiling cosmic entities proposed by physicists as shortcuts through vast areas of spacetime. Tripping through various theories of black holes and singularities, she came upon the term, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_singularity"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title=""ring singularity"">ring singularity</a>, which refers to a point with infinite density that has a radius, like a ring - unlike a singularity which has virtually no spacial dimensions at all. This lead to ""ringularity"". Then, because the piece is a passageway, it became Xingularity, from X-ing, or crossing.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>
<img align=""left"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://vibrata.com/xingularity/ladderShot.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>
</div>
<p>Bringing Xingularity to the playa means bringing it home to the place it was conceived.</p>
<p>For Priceless, the piece was developed to the maximum potential our bootstrapped-budget would allow. Because the design is modular, adding more pieces will add to the scale and impact of the piece and give it a new symmetry. We're in the process of creating one additional arch, bringing the total to five and expanding it another 4 feet.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Wood may be versatile and strong, but it's not indestructible. The desert dust, wind and sun are cryptonite to Xingularity and it needs protection. So we have painting and varnishing in the works, which will also add depth to the piece by accentuating the shapes and bringing out the natural beauty of the woodgrain.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>New low-voltage LED lighting will replace the power-hungry halogens. We'll need additional lights to take into account the expanded size.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We've kept the costs as low as possible, but these expenses are critical. Your donations can help Xingularity grow to its full potential!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your donations will pay for some 3/4"" plywood made of sustainably harvested pine, sold by a locally owned small lumber company. No Home Depot! Rob Bell will get paid for his indispensable roll as fabricator. Our new LEDs will be paid for. We'll get some suitably durable all-weather varnish and primer.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img align=""right"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://vibrata.com/xingularity/xingularity.sticker2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>Hopefully you'll come out to Black Rock City and enjoy Xingularity for yourself! Whether or not you do, you can proudly sport a Xingularity Button, wear the Xingularity design on a custom shirt or decorate something you love with a high-quality vinyl decal. Or get a piece of Vibrata's artwork for yourself in the form of a collectible trading card!</p>

<p>We are curators, artists, and writers from the MFA programme at Goldsmiths College, and we are working together on a project for the Lewisham ArtHouse. For the past few weeks, we’ve been meeting to discuss what we as a group can do with this space, and we’ve come up with a solution that is collaborative, unsual, dynamic, and a host of other adjectives!</p>
<p>The project is called <em>Kill The Lollipop</em>, which is taken from the drawing game known as 'kill lust lollipop'. It references the communal activity of 'drawing' together, with undetermined outcomes and consequences. We will be installing work over a timetabled exhibition which involves both performance and multimedia installations of all sorts. The exhibition will be in a perpetually state of flux, as artists are asked to create site-specific work which addresses the space as it 'grows'.</p>
<p>Each artist will be given a space on a dedicated day of the exhibition to install work. On the first day of the exhibition (May 7th) the first time-tabled artists will begin to install their work and by the end of the two weeks, all of the participating artists will occupy the space. The last day of the installation (May 20th)will be the end of the exhibition, and will be the culmination of the project. Additionally, performances will be scheduled on various days throughout the two- week event.  A catalogue project will be running alongside this exhibition and will be available at the venue.</p>
<p>We are all very excited about this project because of all its possibilities, but also because it is in a great venue! The Lewisham ArtHouse is in our neighborhood, and is a fantastic community resource. We are thrilled that we are lucky enough to have this space at our disposal, especially since it is in our own backyard.</p>
<p>We need the funding to offset some of the general costs that accompany a show, such as installation tools, promotional materials (catalogues, cards) and the actual space. We are all planning on contributing as well, but any help would be much appreciated. If we manage to raise all the money, it will really allow us to focus more on the project and its potential.</p>
<p>We are all first year students, and this project is an inaugural step for us in terms of working together as a group and across disciplines.</p>
<p>Thanks so much!</p></div>","Hello all!

<p> As many of you know, this year I am attending Paul Mitchell the school Charlotte. It's a really great school and it opens up many doors of opportunity. The way they teach is similar to that of Harvard, including the multiple intelligences. I really like the environment and the curriculum, and I am doing really well there! The school is broken down essentially into 3 parts; CORE, a 5 week course on the basics of hair styling and cutting and culture that PM strives to achieve; Prodige, another 5 week course focusing on hands on work with the mannequin and more textbook work; and then finally we move on to the clinic floor and we have clients!! So far, I have completed the first 5 weeks and graduated CORE. This is very exciting for me because I have gotten 100% on all my textbook tests, 100% in attendance, and a 90% on my practical exam (so I've got just enough room to improve before I go to state board to get certified)</p>
<p>Anyways, the reason I wanted to share all this with you is because by October 1st I hope to raise 1500 dollars to go towards my education. As I said, PM offers many opportunities for it's students, and one of them is a 3 day education conference in Las Vegas called Caper. At this three day conference, it will be jam packed with education from platform artists (people who are really good at what they do) including speakers like Jean-Paul DeJoria, the co-owner of Paul Mitchell and also Patron tequila, a very successful business man. So needless to say, this three day conference will be VERY educational for everything to hair design techniques to business and financial advice.

<p>So, what does the 1500 dollars go towards? Well, basically, I raise the money, and I bring it to school on the morning of October 1st and I hand it to our receptionist. Then, I am given my Caper ticket, along with $1500 dollars of Paul Mitchell tools and product to sell so I can afford the flight, dinner, and any other expenses I may encounter on those days in Vegas. </p>
<p>I would really appreciate it if you could donate to my cause, any amount would be appreciated. Like I said, I've been doing really well, and I hope to do just as well once I graduate (Probably around May). This conference looks GREAT on resumes and can help me get my foot into the door I'm hoping to get into (fashion photography). If you would like to donate, you can do so here</p>Thanks so much, <p>Crystal Boland</p></span></span></div>","Dear Friends & Family;
 As many of you know, this year I am attending Paul Mitchell the school Charlotte. It's a really great school and it opens up many doors of opportunity. The way they teach is similar to that of Harvard, including the multiple intelligences. I really like the environment and the curriculum, and I am doing really well there! The school is broken down essentially into 3 parts; CORE, a 5 week course on the basics of hair styling and cutting and culture that PM strives to achieve; Prodige, another 5 week course focusing on hands on work with the mannequin and more textbook work; and then finally we move on to the clinic floor and we have clients!! So far, I have completed the first 5 weeks and graduated CORE. This is very exciting for me because I have gotten 100% on all my textbook tests, 100% in attendance, and a 90% on my practical exam (so I've got just enough room to improve before I go to state board to get certified)
Anyways, the reason I wanted to share all this with you is because by October 1st I hope to raise 1500 dollars to go towards my education. As I said, PM offers many opportunities for it's students, and one of them is a 3 day education conference in Las Vegas called Caper. At this three day conference, it will be jam packed with education from platform artists (people who are really good at what they do) including speakers like Jean-Paul DeJoria, the co-owner of Paul Mitchell and also Patron tequila, a very successful business man. So needless to say, this three day conference will be VERY educational for everything to hair design techniques to business and financial advice.

</div><p><b>Hello</b>, my name is <b>Connie Herberg</b> and <b>I am an artist</b> (primarily a painter)I living near Shepherd, MT.  I live in a rural area where I have a view of the sunrise and sunset each day.  I am nestled among grain fields and pastures, with commanding views of several mountain ranges, rimrocks and a creek that gurgles through the coulee below the house.  I have always felt part of the landscape and that remains an overarching theme in my work. You can see my work and read more at <a href=""http://www.connieherbergfineart.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>www.connieherbergfineart.com</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have earned a B.A. in Fine Art with an emphasis on drawing and sculpture.  I believe in the fundamental value of the arts to enhance learning, as a core to our daily needs (who designed your toaster?), and I believe it elevates societal values (make art not war).</p>
<p><b>I am asking you to help me build an art studio</b>.  It is my dream to have a proper studio working space that not only allows room to work on large paintings, but also provides an adequate space for framing and storage, along with room for an instruction / workshop area.  We have acreage to build an additional garage building on our property and, If you help me raise enough money, I can add a studio onto that building and solve my workspace problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>My current studio consists of a converted bedroom</b> in my home which only  allows painting space for small projects, this computes to roughly a 6x6 floor area where I can stand to paint and an 7’ ceiling that prohibits my easel extension, thereby limiting my workable canvas sizes.  I share the rest of the overall space with my office, supply storage and a working table for my landscape design projects.  <b>It is more than a bit cramped. </b> I have had to rent outside space on occasion to complete larger projects.  This is an expense I would rather put into my own property.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>My initial need is $40,000. </b> This <b>phase one</b> will pay for my portion of additional building materials, that will have to be added on to the main building for the framing, concrete, windows and door, electrical, plumbing, and heating.  Basically this will erect the outside shell.  This space will be nothing extravagant, just practical working space where I can hold classes, host small workshops and  individual students. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b>“A true artist is not one who is inspired, but one who inspires others”  Salvador Dali</b></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Phase two</b> will finish the project after the shell is erected, I will have approximately another $35,000 need to sheet rock and paint, add trim and light fixtures, flooring, cabinets, countertops and a work table.  This will make a solid workable space with no frills.  My husband and I will supply as much of the labor as we reasonably can.  This includes some of the work needed to erect interior walls, sheetrock, paint, trim and whatever else we can manage.  I will put that into a separate campaign unless the need is met here.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>I work daily with dedication</b> in my current studio and am fully committed to my chosen career.  I am equally adept at the business and marketing end of art as well as the framing, matting, stretcher building, packing and multitude of other responsibilities that go along with this career.   To put it in a nutshell, <b>I’m the whole dog and pony show</b>.  </p>
<p>
</p><p><b>This additional space will not only allow me more elbow room, but provide the possibility of added revenue through workshops, classes and students.  </b>An artist’s life is not a steady paycheck.  The sale of artwork is sporadic at best and more often than not, the available unsold inventory is ten times the annual revenue.  Teaching allows a steadier income stream with lower overhead and fills in the income gaps.  </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>I have only 30 days to raise this phase of revenue, so I’m asking for your immediate consideration,</b></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Donate today</b> and you will receive a really great <b>perk </b>(remember to supply your mailing address if you wish to receive your perk):</p>
<p>

You can see my work and read more at www.connieherbergfineart.com

I have earned a B.A. in Fine Art with an emphasis on drawing and sculpture.  I believe in the fundamental value of the arts to enhance learning, as a core to our daily needs (who designed your toaster?), and I believe it elevates societal values (make art not war).
I am asking you to help me build an art studio.  It is my dream to have a proper studio working space that not only allows room to work on large paintings, but also provides an adequate space for framing and storage, along with room for an instruction / workshop area.  We have acreage to build an additional garage building on our property and, If you help me raise enough money, I can add a studio onto that building and solve my workspace problems.

My current studio consists of a converted bedroom in my home which only  allows painting space for small projects, this computes to roughly a 6x6 floor area where I can stand to paint and an 7’ ceiling that prohibits my easel extension, thereby limiting my workable canvas sizes.  I share the rest of the overall space with my office, supply storage and a working table for my landscape design projects.  It is more than a bit cramped.  I have had to rent outside space on occasion to complete larger projects.  This is an expense I would rather put into my own property.

My initial need is $40,000.  This phase one will pay for my portion of additional building materials, that will have to be added on to the main building for the framing, concrete, windows and door, electrical, plumbing, and heating.  Basically this will erect the outside shell.  This space will be nothing extravagant, just practical working space where I can hold classes, host small workshops and  individual students. 

“A true artist is not one who is inspired, but one who inspires others”  Salvador Dali

Phase two will finish the project after the shell is erected, I will have approximately another $35,000 need to sheet rock and paint, add trim and light fixtures, flooring, cabinets, countertops and a work table.  This will make a solid workable space with no frills.  My husband and I will supply as much of the labor as we reasonably can.  This includes some of the work needed to erect interior walls, sheetrock, paint, trim and whatever else we can manage.  I will put that into a separate campaign unless the need is met here.

I work daily with dedication in my current studio and am fully committed to my chosen career.  I am equally adept at the business and marketing end of art as well as the framing, matting, stretcher building, packing and multitude of other responsibilities that go along with this career.   To put it in a nutshell, I’m the whole dog and pony show.  

This additional space will not only allow me more elbow room, but provide the possibility of added revenue through workshops, classes and students.  An artist’s life is not a steady paycheck.  The sale of artwork is sporadic at best and more often than not, the available unsold inventory is ten times the annual revenue.  Teaching allows a steadier income stream with lower overhead and fills in the income gaps.  


I have only 30 days to raise this phase of revenue, so I’m asking for your immediate consideration,

Donate today and you will receive a really great perk (remember to supply your mailing address if you wish to receive your perk):

Perks range from a thank you, note cards, book, original small paintings framed and unframed, to a large “Montana Trilogy” triptych (each panel 3.5’w x 6.5’ h) + personal thank you + signed book + original design note cards.

If I don’t reach my goal on phase one of this project, the money raised will still go toward the building of the studio, as far as it will reach.  I hope you will find that I am not asking for something for nothing.  I wasn’t raised to take without repayment.  I think you will find that the perks are substantial. 

Please share this campaign on your Facebook or Twitter account using the Indiegogo share tools.  Remember, www.connieherbergfineart.com for more information and to view my artwork.  Thanks for your time and consideration.  I will keep you posted on the progress on Indieigogo and through my Facebook page.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>International Artist Residency</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Michael H Thomas, and I'm an Artist based out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I want you to imagine an opportunity for yourself, where you are chosen to attend a residency where you are allowed to do what you love and do best freely for two weeks. The only draw back is that the residency requires you to pay their fees to attend. Missing this opportunity that could grow your career only because you do not have the funds, would be very upsetting. Now you see what my issue is. If the campaign is successful, I will be able to create art and grow as an artist! Not only will I grow as an artist, but it will also help open other opportunities later on when it is seen that I have attended an International Residency on my resume. With that considered, any contribution would greatly help me and my career as an artist.</p>
<p>This campaign will require $5000 dollars to be successful. The residency requires me to provide $2200 for their fees. Beyond their fees, I will not be able to take my personal art supplies to France with me. Art supplies are very expensive and will add up fast. For example, oil paint could add up to $500, assuming the price is comparable to what it is in the United States. Additionally, I will need to buy supplies to create my painting surfaces, brushes, a pallet, and other tools.  </p>
<p>Now, I know what you are thinking; is this campaign safe? Honestly, I can say this is the safest campaign on Indiegogo! I am a seasoned artist who has been creating art for more than 15 years. Also, while I am in France, I will be posting videos and photos of all my paintings on all of my social media so you can literally see what this campaign is benefiting. As added comfort, I have my Bachelor's and Master's in Fine Arts. The time spent with this residency will be valuable to me because it will allow me to expand my knowledge and experience in the arts. This opportunity is not just something I want, but something I absolutely need. </p>
<p>Want some Perks?? I promise for the first ten contributors who donate $100 or more, I will create a drawing that will be displayed on my Instagram page with you tagged in it!  Also, while I am in France, I will be posting videos of myself painting and posting everything I am doing. </p>
<p>Overall, I do want to reiterate how important this residency is to me. This opportunity is everything I have been trying to achieve for the last 5 years. It is an opportunity that will open many doors for me later in my career. Please help me take this once in a life time opportunity!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
In September 2010 I started this epic journey over land to India I left with about 3000kr (about 400 Euroes) in the bank, but with friends, instruments, pens and paper, we made it through 22 countries, by music, art and living on minimum budgets and not the least, by the help of hundreds of amazing people along the way. The goal; Living and Learning.<br/><p>Now I am at the end of my trip and those 3000kr in the bank is finally basically gone and I am ready to ask for one last big hand from you!<br/>This trip has been an incredible learning process, it has shown us nature, life and humanity at it's highest and it's lowest. I have seen more and learned more than I thought I would. My idea is now to go home and write a book and make an art exhibition, to share with all, and for myself to understand all I've seen and learned so far. The journey of life is not over, but for the moment. I am ready to go home!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>For 300$ I will be able to afford a flight ticket to Istanbul, Turkey and can then hitchhike my way from there in a few days to Denmark. </p>
<p>For 400$ I will be able to purchase a flight ticket all the way to Copenhagen.</p>
<p>For 600$ I will be able to fly home and survive without bigger problems the last weeks in India (right now I am selling stickers to pay for my food)</p>
<p>For 700$ I will be able to fly home, survive in India and have a little bit to fall on when I come to Denmark without any income or a place to live.</p>
<p>For 1000$ I will be able to do the above and also have some breathing space to live my dream of writing a book and make an exhibition about my journey! In this way I will be able to give more back!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What I can give you in direct thanks for your help, is my art, as has helped me survive so far and that I hope I will be able to live of in the future as well.</p>

<p>Please see our website <a href=""http://www.templeofpromise.org/donate"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.templeofpromise.org/donate</a> for more ways to help us bring the Temple of Promise to the playa this year and warm thanks to all of you who have helped us thus far.</p>
<br/><h4>Update: 6/17/2015</h4>
<h4></h4>
<p>We are deeply grateful to each of you who donated to the Temple of Promise and helped us reach our goal for this campaign! We're also grateful that many of you are continuing to give - every additional dollar is just as helpful. Our Burning Man grant covered 25% of our total budget and this IndieGoGo campaign covered another good chunk of what we need. Thank you for making this happen! </p>
<p></p>
<p>There are lots of exciting ways we're planning to raise our remaining funds. In July, we're working on a dance party in L.A. and San Francisco. We're also trying to reach donors with much deeper pockets who may be able to sponsor entire portions of our project, such as the creation of our trees which will cost around $17,500 each, for example. Someone could also purchase the trees outright and place them outside their business or home as they will survive the ritual fire and will be a memorable art piece for years to come. So keep an eye out for our upcoming campaign for The Grove.</p>
<p>Your efforts here helped us complete and surpass this particular goal. Without your help here, we'd have a significant gap that would be even more difficult to fill. Thank you, deeply, for each dollar you gave and if you continue to give here past our deadline, IndieGoGo will continue to send us the funds. We can't wait to welcome you to the Temple of Promise on playa this year &lt;3.</p>

We are so grateful to our funders for helping us reach $70K.  Thank you!  

~ Dreamers Guild


Update: 6/18/2015


Our campaign is now ""InDemand"" which means we can continue to accept your gracious donations even though our deadline has passed. For a short time, we will continue to offer our popular perks with each new donation. Get them while you can!
Please see our website www.templeofpromise.org/donate for more ways to help us bring the Temple of Promise to the playa this year and warm thanks to all of you who have helped us thus far.
Update: 6/17/2015

We are deeply grateful to each of you who donated to the Temple of Promise and helped us reach our goal for this campaign! We're also grateful that many of you are continuing to give - every additional dollar is just as helpful. Our Burning Man grant covered 25% of our total budget and this IndieGoGo campaign covered another good chunk of what we need. Thank you for making this happen! 

There are lots of exciting ways we're planning to raise our remaining funds. In July, we're working on a dance party in L.A. and San Francisco. We're also trying to reach donors with much deeper pockets who may be able to sponsor entire portions of our project, such as the creation of our trees which will cost around $17,500 each, for example. Someone could also purchase the trees outright and place them outside their business or home as they will survive the ritual fire and will be a memorable art piece for years to come. So keep an eye out for our upcoming campaign for The Grove.
Your efforts here helped us complete and surpass this particular goal. Without your help here, we'd have a significant gap that would be even more difficult to fill. Thank you, deeply, for each dollar you gave and if you continue to give here past our deadline, IndieGoGo will continue to send us the funds. We can't wait to welcome you to the Temple of Promise on playa this year <3.
Update: 6/14/2015
Yesterday one of the trees from the Temple grove made a guest appearance at the DISTRIKT REVEL Station party.  

We've pulled together this video of how the trees are being constructed by Artist Kevin Byall.  

UPDATE 6/10/2015
A few weeks ago, Temple of Promise artist Jazz Tigan was invited to speak at the Desert Arts Preview in San Francisco. His story makes a powerful connection between the Temples of Burning Man and events surrounding the aftermath of 9/11. With this, we are reminded of what a special place it is that we're creating, this Temple of Promise.

Please have a listen for yourself.




UPDATE 6/4/2015

The build site is buzzing with activity.  Check out our progress! 

The TempleA tradition at Burning Man since 2000, the Temple serves as Black Rock City's spiritual nexus – a  contemplative space of reflection, solace, celebration, bereavement, communion, and release. This year we need your support to make the Temple of Promise a reality. Temple of Promise begins with an immense skyward-reaching spire, clad entirely in shimmering copper. As you move deeper into the gently curving structure you pass beneath a progression of delicate archways which gradually descend to a decidedly human scale. When you pass through the final archway you emerge into an encircled grove of sculpted trees. 

In the beginning, the trees stand empty and exposed. Visitors will leave messages of remembrance on lengths of cloth, tying them to the branches. In this way, as the days pass, the trees will come into full bloom and take on the shape of weeping willows.
The Temple lives for only one week. In this brief moment it serves as a spiritual vessel, receiving everything that is brought to it. On the last night, every memento, every joyous moment, and every tear is released when the Temple is burned to ash.



What We Need


The Burning Man Project provides the initial seed funds for the Temple through an honorarium grant, but most of the funding comes from the generosity of the community. The cost of building, transporting, and burning such a large structure is considerable and this campaign represents only a fraction of what is required.

It is a submission  based zine and each issue will follow a different theme. We encourage a variety of people to submit their art work and we encourage not just 'artists' to submit, but anyone who feels inspired to create. We accept any kind of artwork that can be displayed on a page. This includes, but is not limited to: drawings, paintings, collage, doodles, design, poetry, short stories, illustration, photography, sculpture, jewelry and glass. Although our zine is based in Philadelphia, we encouraged people to submit from all over the U.S. and plan to distribute the zine in different cities. The launch of our first zine will culminate with a zine launch party and art show at Nice Things Handmade, a local handmade art boutique and gallery.</p>
<p>Spred is created by Naima Merella and Tina Mukherjee, two artists who met in college. We initially decided to create this zine after noticing how little artwork people created after they graduated from school and real life hit. However, after we began to work on the zine it blossomed into so much more.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<h3>Motivation to Create &amp; Building Community </h3>
<p>Spred was created to motivate people to create art for fun! Spred is a platform where this artwork can live and be viewed by a variety of people, hopefully inspiring more people to create art and support the arts. Allowing more people to understand the importance of expressing themselves creatively and witnessing all the positive effects of personal expression. We feel this is so needed in a country where generally artists and creating art is not very valued. </p>
<p>Spred was also created as a way to build a community of people who enjoy art with people who enjoy creating art. In addition to offering our print and online zine Spred will host events such as art shows, art parties and critiques.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul>
</ul>
<br/><h3>FREEdom </h3> <p>We want Spred to be a free zine, this way money will not be an obstacle for anyone submitting artwork or anyone who wants to look at the zine. This gives people more incentive to create artwork and to look at the artwork in the zine. Ultimatley allowing our contributors to get more exposure and hopefully to inspire that many more people to create art. </p>
<p>In order to print a CMYK color zine we need to raise $2,200. This will allow us to print 500 copies of a 40 page mini zine. Our dream goal is to raise $2,500 so that we can print 1000 copies of a 40 page zine. </p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal we will be forced to find a cheaper printer or even print the zine in black and white, which would take away from most of the amazing artwork we received. Any extra money will go toward promo materials for the zine and art show.</p>

<div>Our biggest risk right now is not raising enough money to print the zine and having to cancel the zine and art show. Another big challenge for us was finding an affordable printing company that would also produce a good quality zine. We did not want to compromise quality for the cost of printing because as artists we know presentation is so important and can completely change the way a viewer sees and interprets a work of art. As this is our first zine it has been a lot of trial and error a long with a ton of hard work. </div>

<h3>What</h3>
<p><i>Raw to the Surface</i> is the last step through my Master experience. With it I want to place myself in the contemporary photography discourse suggesting a new approach and escaping from the bidimentional and digital displays to connect my pictures to the viewer in a more intimate, shaking way. </p>
<p>Social media as Instagram taught us to look at images as a sort of flow on the screen, now Snapchat and Instagram Stories are increasing this disconnection between visual material and personal involvement, making the time we devote to an image decrease to less than a second.</p>
<p><i>Raw to the Surface</i> wants to invert this tendency, re-starting from the body, allowing time, but letting the power to the viewer. </p>
<p>The project will involve various works devoted to the exploration  of the limit between inside and outside of the body, including a series of interactive and tactile pictures that the visitor will be able to touch and even modify during a one-night-performance and opening that will take place at 71a Gallery, Shoreditch, on the 1st December.

<h3>Why support?</h3>
<p>I believe in the importance of physicality, of experiencing things on one’s skin. In a time where the sense of touch is more and more connected to a screen and the consciousness of one’s body pass through a phone camera I feel the urge to provoke the viewer through an interactive experience to get lost inside the body, challenging the perception and view of the female body as flesh and skin. </p>
<p>During my MA I have experimented with new materials and new displays to create a different discourse about photography and fashion. Unfortunately, most of the times many good ideas had to be reviewed and resized because of a small budget.</p>
<p>I feel that this time it's important to push this project forward and give it the chance to become something bigger. I feel that many people would love to finally be able to touch a picture or an artwork in a gallery space, to interact with the objects they see and experience a new way to rapport to photography. It's a new approach, that in my opinion deserves to come to life. If you feel the same, if you are tired of pictures on a screen and digital bodies without wrinkles, folds or imperfections, please support <i>Raw to the Surface</i>!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How</h3>
<p>My team and I are working for free to produce the final pictures, as I usually create a fashion editorial as well as my personal pictures on each session, to offer them a publication on a magazine and new pictures for their portfolios as a compensation for their time and help. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, the production of the final pictures require tests and experimental printing processes, to find the best materials and display methods to fit the idea. </p>
<p>Moreover as the project is thought as interactive I am planning to host a three days exhibition at the Gallery 71A in Shoreditch, between the 1st and the 3rd December, with an opening night-performance in which the visitors will be able to see and interact with the works.</p>
<p>The money raised thanks to your contributions will help me covering the expenses of testing, printing and exhibiting my work.</p>
<p>Of the <strong>£2000</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>£750</strong> will cover the venue hire,</p>
<p><strong>£350</strong> will cover the promotion and the realisation of the opening night (flyers, posters, staffing for the night at the bar, security, video-maker to film the interaction with the works) , </p>
<p><strong>£500</strong> will cover the tests and printing,</p>
<p><strong>£300</strong> will cover the production of a final catalogue including the pictures of all the works realised for the exhibition, stills of the opening night and of the results of the interaction of the public with the works,</p>
<p><strong>£100</strong> will cover the Indiegogo costs.</p>
<p>If you are starting to figure how <i>Raw to the Surface</i> could look and you are curious to see the final result you can support the project with as much as you wish! Every donation matters!  Have a look at the perks available that include prints, portrait sessions, personalised darkroom prints and much more! </p>
<p>Reaching the goal would be really important to give to this project its best chance and look, but even in case the goal is not reached all the funds collected will be used for the realisation of the prints and the exhibition, reviewing the budget and eventually trimming down the copies of the final catalogue and the opening night expenses. </p>
</div><div><p> </p></div><div>
<h3>Afraid?</h3>
<p>Thinking about an exhibition while the work to be exhibited is still in production is a big challenge. It requires a lot of steady nerves and good organisation skills. I believe I have these features, and even if the time is not much most of the work is already done and the more I'm experimenting on the display options, the more I can't wait to have this project exhibited in a space. All my works are always thought as exhibited but rarely I have the chance to produce an entire body of work knowing the space where it will be and being able to imagine how the whole thing will look like. </p>
<p>The interactive choice requires as well a good amount of courage. I am giving my pictures in the hands of the viewers, presenting months of hard work and giving the chance to destroy it. I am basically undressing together with my pictures, and I really hope that you all will be able to be part of this experience and get something home from it.   </p>

<h3>Cos'è?</h3>
<p><i>Raw to the Surface</i> è l'ultimo passo che mi porta alla conclusione del Master. Con questo progetto desidero posizionare il mio lavoro all'interno del panorama della fotografia contemporanea, cercando di suggerire un approccio differente, che si discosti dalla bidimensionalità e dal digitale ed attraverso il quale lo spettatore possa interagire in maniera più intima. </p>
<p>Social Media come Instagram ci hanno insegnato a guardare le immagini seguendo un flusso che scorre sullo schermo. Ora Snapchat ed Instagram Stories stanno incrementando sempre più la distanza tra materiale visivo e fruitore, facendo precipitare il tempo che dedichiamo ad un'immagine a meno di un secondo. </p>
<p><i>Raw to the Surface</i> vuole invertire questa tendenza, ripartendo dalla fisicità del corpo, concedendo più tempo, ma mantenendo il controllo nelle mani dello spettatore.</p>
<p>Il progetto comprenderà vari lavori volti all'esplorazione del limite tra interno ed esterno del corpo, compresa una serie  di stampe tattili che il pubblico potrà manipolare durante la serata di apertura - performance il 1º Dicembre, alla 71A Gallery. </p>
<p>La mostra rimarrà poi aperta fino al 3 Dicembre per permettere di scoprire come le foto sono state modificate durante la serata. </p>
<p>Il progetto è inoltre arricchito da collaborazioni con artisti e designer che condividono l'interesse per la pelle, la fisicità del corpo e la ricerca su nuovi metodi di esposizione. Tra questi <a href=""http://markgoldby.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mark Goldby</a>, presente all'interno della mostra con un lavoro realizzato a quattro mani; <a href=""http://www.fionabetsyfaumuina.com/#1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fiona Faumuina</a>, <a href=""http://abiskinner.tumblr.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Abi Skinner</a>, <a href=""http://manuelamenzi.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Manuela Menzi</a>, <a href=""http://www.paula-q-yu.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Paula Q.

<p> </p>
<h3>Perché sostenere il progetto?</h3>
<p>Credo sia importante riscoprire la materialità del corpo umano, e con essa la capacità di sperimentare sulla propria pelle. In un tempo in cui il tatto è per lo più legato ad uno schermo ed in cui la coscienza di sé passa attraverso la camera di uno smartphone credo sia necessario provocare lo spettatore attraverso un'esperienza interattiva che metta in discussione la percezione del corpo, per scuoterlo e farlo perdere nei meandri di pelle, carne e rughe.</p>
<p>Durante il master ho sperimentato diversi materiali e forme espositive per cercare di smuovere l'idea di fotografia, moda e fotografia di moda. Sfortunatamente, molte volte buone idee sono state accantonate o ridimensionate a causa di un budget ristretto.</p>
<p>Credo sia arrivato il momento di spingere questo progetto al massimo per dargli la possibilità di diventare qualcosa di davvero grande. Scommetto che molte persone non vedono l'ora di poter finalmente toccare un oggetto in mostra, che normalmente è visto e vissuto con un certo timore reverenziale. Si tratta di un approccio diverso, che vuole mettere in discussione l'approccio tattile che si ha con le foto sullo schermo, trasportandolo in un contesto analogico. La prossima volta che siete su un social network fermatevi per un secondo e cercate di ricordare la penultima immagine passata a schermo. È molto difficile, perché non si guarda più niente, lo sguardo scorre e non si fissa. Il tatto può aiutare a concentrarsi nuovamente su quello che si ha sotto gli occhi e sotto le mani. <br/>Supportando <i>Raw to the Surface</i>  aiuterete a dar vita ad un'esperienza interattiva, che porta in mostra corpi veri, con pelle, rughe e lentiggini, che parlano dell'essere umano, da toccare, manipolare e ricordare. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Come </h3>
<p>Tutte le persone coinvolte nel progetto stanno lavorando gratis alla produzione delle fotografie finali. Sto cercando di offrire sempre la produzione di un editoriale moda in parallelo ai miei scatti personali, in modo da dare al team una pubblicazione o nuove foto per il loro portfolio come ricompensa per il loro tempo ed aiuto.</p>
<p>Ciò nonostante la produzione delle immagini finali richiede test pratici e svariati esperimenti di stampa per trovare i materiali più adatti e le modalità di esposizione migliori. Inoltre, essendo il progetto pensato come interattivo, sto organizzando una mostra dal 1º al 3 Dicembre alla 71A Gallery con una serata di apertura-performance il 1º Dicembre durante la quale gli spettatori avranno la possibilità di vedere, toccare e manipolare le foto esposte. </p>
<p>I fondi raccolti attraverso questa campagna mi permetteranno di coprire le spese dei test di stampa, delle stampe finali, della galleria, della opening night e di un catalogo finale che raccolga gli scatti in mostra e la documentazione della serata interattiva.</p>
<p>Dei <strong>£2000</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>£750</strong> andranno a coprire i costi della galleria;</p>
<p><strong>£350</strong> copriranno la promozione e realizzazione della serata di apertura (volantini, poster, staff per la serata, sicurezza, video-maker per filmare l'interazione con le opere);</p>
<p><strong>£500</strong> saranno destinati a test e stampe finali;</p>
<p><strong>£300</strong> alla produzione del catalogo finale;</p>
<p><strong>£100</strong> copriranno le spese della piattaforma Indiegogo</p>
<p>Se state cominciando ad immaginare come <i>Raw to the Surface</i> potrebbe essere e siete curiosi di vedere il risultato finale potete supportare il progetto con quanto volete. È inoltre possibile fare un'offerta per uno dei ""perk"", ossia piccoli ringraziamenti materiali che posso offrire in cambio della vostra generosità. Tra questi stampe, ritratti fotografici ad hoc, stampe personalizzate in camera oscura e molto altro!</p>
<p>Raggiungere l'obiettivo di £2000 sarebbe davvero importante per dare a questo progetto la migliore chance possibile ma nel caso l'obiettivo non venga raggiunto tutti i fondi saranno comunque utilizzati per la creazione della mostra, revisionando il budget ed eventualmente tagliando sulle copie del catalogo finale e sulle spese per la serata di performance.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Paura?</h3>
<p>Pensare ad una mostra mentre i lavori da esporre sono ancora in fase di lavorazione non è cosa da poco. Richiede nervi saldi ed un grande spirito organizzativo, dote che fortunatamente ritengo di avere. Anche se il tempo è poco gran parte del lavoro è terminato e più faccio esperimenti per le stampe finali più non sto nella pelle di vedere il tutto nello spazio espositivo. </p>
<p>Tutti i miei lavori sono pensati nello spazio, ma raramente ho la possibilità di produrre un lavoro importante e ramificato immaginandolo direttamente all'interno di uno spazio preciso. Questo è un grande vantaggio, che mi permette di lavorare direttamente in vista dell'esperienza in galleria. </p>
<p>La scelta della mostra interattiva richiede altrettanti nervi saldi e coraggio. Sto dando le mie fotografie nelle mani dello spettatore, presentando mesi e mesi di lavoro e dando la possibilità di distruggerne completamente il risultato. Diciamo che in qualche misura mi spoglio insieme alle mie foto, e spero davvero che tutti i presenti tornino a casa arricchiti da questa esperienza inusuale. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Altri modi per supportare il progetto</h3>
<p>So che non tutti hanno la possibilità di supportare un progetto d'arte e sono ben consapevole della presenza di numerose altre cause in giro per il mondo, più serie e più importanti, che vale la pena di supportare economicamente. </p>
<p>Se non ve la sentite di donare per questo progetto per favore aiutate a diffondere la voce condividendo <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/1007007149408674/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">l'evento Facebook</a><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/598340890327321/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> </a>e la mostra su altri social media e al bar davanti ad una birra. Grazie a tutti coloro che parteciperanno dall'Italia e spero di poter raccogliere tanto materiale da poter mostrare a chi non potrà essere presente alla performance. Per tutti gli altri: ci vediamo il 1º Dicembre alla 71A Gallery! </p>

What
Raw to the Surface is the last step through my Master experience. With it I want to place myself in the contemporary photography discourse suggesting a new approach and escaping from the bidimentional and digital displays to connect my pictures to the viewer in a more intimate, shaking way. 
Social media as Instagram taught us to look at images as a sort of flow on the screen, now Snapchat and Instagram Stories are increasing this disconnection between visual material and personal involvement, making the time we devote to an image decrease to less than a second.
Raw to the Surface wants to invert this tendency, re-starting from the body, allowing time, but letting the power to the viewer. 
The project will involve various works devoted to the exploration  of the limit between inside and outside of the body, including a series of interactive and tactile pictures that the visitor will be able to touch and even modify during a one-night-performance and opening that will take place at 71a Gallery, Shoreditch, on the 1st December. The exhibition will then be open during the weekend to experience the work and see the changes caused by previous visitors. 
The project is enriched by collaborations with artists and designers who share the interest for skin, embodiment and new display modes, including: Mark Goldby, who will be part of the exhibition with a collaborative project created ad hoc, Fiona Faumuina, Abi Skinner, Manuela Menzi, Paula Q. Yu.

<p>The theme of the VR @ BM art exhibition will be based on the ‘Turing Test’ made famous by Alan Turing in the 1950’s. The purpose of the Turing Test was to determine whether a machine or computer could exhibit intelligence behavior equivalent to or indistinguishable from a human.

<p><strong>HOW THIS WORKS...</strong></p>
<p>The legnth of the book depends on how many art pieces are pledged for here in the fundraiser. You pick the size you want, I make and ship you the original art while placing a scan and a small spooky story next to it in the book.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>ART SIZE OPTIONS... </strong></p>
<p>The art is available in three sizes; 3x3, 4x4, and 6x6. Each is priced accordingly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>BOOK DISTRIBUTION OPTIONS...</strong></p>
<p>By making this a fundraiser I can distribute the book in three full colored formats. Digitally, which all backers will receive for free or can be pledged for independently, as well as a softcover or hardcover print release which can also be pledged for.</p>

<p><strong>WHY $500...</strong></p>

<h3>What Happened?!?</h3>
<p>We were ROBBED!!  On 12/01/12 we set out on our move from California to our new home in Texas and stopped along the way in Tucson Arizona with our Budget Truck parked safely (at least we thought so) 30 feet away from the hotel entrance.  We woke up the next day and looked out the window only to discover a pile of broken glass where our whole lifes worth of belongings had once been parked.  We were lucky enough to get our car back out of the ordeal which contained my computer with all the magazine files and important info!  So with a few pair of chonies, a couple shirts, and our 2 black cats we pressed on to Texas.  (Sadly our leopard gecko Edgar Allen Poe didn't make it through the move)</p>

<p>All of our magazine company's merch was stolen.  All the issues, all our shirts, our buttons, wristbands, everything.  We also lost all of our start up clothing company's merchandise.  This moving truck cost us $1,500 and in a blink vanished along with thousands of dollars of our belongings along with our items that can not be replaced.  (The truck rental ended up putting me at a negative balance in the bank after they double charged me for the trailer we used to tow the car).  We are the definition of an independent magazine.  All of this product had been purchased through friends donations, an inheritance check from my grandfathers death, loans, etc. (my Grandfather believed in my companies and loaned me the money to get them started in the first place)  My girlfriend also lost her whole make up kit that it had taken over 2 years to put together.  She has put all of her schooling and expertise into our Gore Noir photoshoots.  Any special effects artists will know how much these kits can cost to put together.</p>

<p>བཀྲ་ཤིས་བདེ་ལེགས་ Tashi Delek! I am a linguist and an artist working to promote Tibetan culture by making the language more accessible to a wider range of people. When a language lives, a culture lives.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Language, Tibetan in particular, is not inherently difficult to learn, but the way one learns and the tools one uses are important to how one succeeds.</p>
<p>This book is in response to my own journey learning the language and the resources that I have come across. There is a need for more manuals of language instruction and the manuals need to present the information in an easily understood way.</p>
<p>I am working on a new book teaching the Tibetan language that presents the language through the medium of art that makes understanding flow more easily.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In this small way, I am working to promote and preserve the Tibetan culture. For I am deeply grateful for Tibet and all that its people have given to humanity.  </p>
<p>This fundraising campaign will cover all of supplies needed to complete the book and to print the book itself. I have already completed much of the outlines and sketches for the pages, and then the process of painting and computer editing comes, for which I need more paint, canvases, and computer power to complete.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the cost to print the book! I intend for the book to be printed on recycled paper in Dharamsala by a Tibetan printer. </p>

<p>My name is Jason and I have for most of my life been fascinated by the study of language. I have to varying degrees studied more languages than I can count on my fingers and toes, <strong>but no language has thus far on my journey captivated me as the Tibetan language has.</strong> It is my intention with this work to make it simpler and more expedient to learn this precious gem.</p>
<p>By making it simpler and easier for a greater amount of people to learn, the Tibetan language is encouraged to grow. The more people that can read and speak the language, the more the culture and its wisdom live. <strong>The more a language lives, the more a culture lives.</strong></p>

<p>I intend to accomplish this in three ways: powerful use of art, color, pattern and sacred geometrical design (mandalas) and composition for the physical layout of each page, thus making the information more readily absorbed; secondly, I will assume no prior linguistic knowledge and yet the book will remain comprehensive and authoritive on pronunciation, phonology, and so on.</p>
<p>Lastly, the book will be unique in that you will start reading Tibetan from the very first page. In fact, I am sure that you already speak a lot more Tibetan than you might believe! You probably know words like Lama, Rinpoche,  Pema or the mantra Om Mani Padme Hum, and this book will show you how to begin directly reading, speaking and writing these words in the Tibetan (u-chen) script.</p>

I also need help by sharing this campaign. Please share it with anyone you know who has an interest in promoting and the preserving Tibetan language or culture. Even if you already speak Tibetan, or even if you don't have an interest in the language, I encourage you to donate and share the message of this project with others.
Thank you. I am deeply grateful to you for your help in allowing me to serve humanity in this way. May you all be free from suffering and the causes of suffering.

<p><span>Hi, my name is Shane. I am a dancer and choreographer. I recently left my job working for the Batsheva Ensemble based in Tel Aviv, Israel. I received a BFA in choreography from UC Irvine in 2011 and due to my busy performance schedule with Batsheva my outlet to make work was limited. </span></p>
<p>Naturally, I have a lot of pent up choreographic ideas and I'm grateful to now have the opportunity to actualize some of them. Nature 2 is my vessel. This campaign is designed to provide support for all aspects of building a choreographic work. From the research to the making of the piece to the first performance in Santa Barbara, California.</p>
<p>Nature 2 is a project I devised to merge my biggest passions: Dance and Nature. As an adult my love for nature has continued to grow. I hike, read essays and daydream about it constantly. This obsession fills me with so much joy I considered divorcing my first love, dance, and spending all my efforts in becoming a National Park Ranger or something like that. I used to ask myself, what could be better than that!?  It took a while but I realized that such a divorce probably wouldn’t bring me the utopian mountain man happiness I was dreaming of. But maybe combining these interests could? Hence Nature 2!</p>
<p>The project will be aided by my partner and collaborator Ayelet Nadav. Together we will conduct extensive research in the field. We will visit over 15 National Parks during the winter of 2016 collecting material. We will document our experiences with writing, film, and photography. The goal is to collect a hefty load of material and thoughts to bring with us to the studio. When we’ve finished the outdoor portion of the process we will move inside to create and design a thoughtful piece of choreography. </p>Nature 2 is an experiment. Can a piece be made for a theatrical setting that involves as much thought provoking detail and empathy about nature as the writings of John Muir, Edward Abbey, Gary Snyder, Jack Kerouac, and Apsley Cherry- Garrard? What will a nature essay using performance look like? And who will make it if I don't?<br/><p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p><span>This campaign is designed to help fund Nature 2 in all stages of its development. Below is a description of how the money will be spread across the three main stages of the process.</span></p>
<p>RESEARCH &amp; FIELDWORK</p>
<ul><li><p>Camera: an upgrade to my personal camera equipment is needed. I utilize photography and video a lot in my works. For the last few years I’ve been able to manage with the camera on my phone and an old flip camera (remember those). This piece deserves better!</p></li></ul>
<p>THE MAKING OF</p>

<p>PERFORMANCE</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Theatrical space rental: I would like to premier Nature 2 at Santa Barbara’s Center Stage Theater. This allowance will help rent the theater itself and pay the technical staff for our limited in theater rehearsal time. This venue is the perfect intimate space for Nature 2  and luckily the rates are reasonable .</p></li>
<li><p>PR stipend: The performance will need PR. We want as many people to come see this evening as possible. This stipend will pay for flyers and ads in local papers</p></li>
<li><p>Performer payment: This money will go to Ayelet as a symbolic payment for her work in this project. I believe in paying artists a living wage for their work, and I wish I had the means to do that now.

<p><b>For 12 years, Celebrate México Now Festival has been New York City's 1st— and only —annual festival of contemporary Mexican art and culture.</b> We have been a platform for over 300 talented visual artists, musicians, dancers, authors, chefs and filmmakers to showcase their work in over 50 cultural organizations in the grand city of New York. We are also very proud to have presented renowned performances and many World Premieres.</p>
<p>This year <b>Celebrate México Now</b> will once again showcase contemporary Mexican culture and the arts in major venues across New York City. </p>
<p>We invite you to join us for outstanding events including photo exhibits, film screenings, concerts, culinary programs, panels, and performances.</p>
<p>Funding for the arts is very scarce and even more so for international projects. Although we have been able to secure backing from our longtime supporters and partner venues, we still need additional funding to bring this festival to you.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>OUR IMPACT</b></p>
<p>For over a decade, <b>Celebrate México Now</b> has highlighted the creativity, ingenuity, heritage, and heart that contemporary Mexican artists bring to every arts discipline and creative industry. Venturing into to the cutting edge of contemporary expression, <b>Celebrate México Now</b>  will bring New Yorkers an exclusive glimpse into how today’s Mexican artists reflect on and reshape Mexican identity in an evolving global context. The Festival’s multi-disciplinary nature yields a comprehensive cultural picture of the passions and concerns that make today’s Mexico so complex and fascinating.</p>
<p><b>Celebrate México Now Festival </b>has successfully completed Indiegogo campaigns in past years to secure the support needed to continue this citywide cultural festival. </p><p><b><i>Help us reach our goal in 2015! Check out the awesome perks we're offering and give now.</i></b></p>

WE CAN DO THIS TOGETHER!

For 12 years, Celebrate México Now Festival has been New York City's 1st— and only —annual festival of contemporary Mexican art and culture. We have been a platform for over 300 talented visual artists, musicians, dancers, authors, chefs and filmmakers to showcase their work in over 50 cultural organizations in the grand city of New York. We are also very proud to have presented renowned performances and many World Premieres.
This year Celebrate México Now will once again showcase contemporary Mexican culture and the arts in major venues across New York City. 
We invite you to join us for outstanding events including photo exhibits, film screenings, concerts, culinary programs, panels, and performances.
Funding for the arts is very scarce and even more so for international projects. Although we have been able to secure backing from our longtime supporters and partner venues, we still need additional funding to bring this festival to you.
OUR IMPACT
For over a decade, Celebrate México Now has highlighted the creativity, ingenuity, heritage, and heart that contemporary Mexican artists bring to every arts discipline and creative industry. Venturing into to the cutting edge of contemporary expression, Celebrate México Now  will bring New Yorkers an exclusive glimpse into how today’s Mexican artists reflect on and reshape Mexican identity in an evolving global context. The Festival’s multi-disciplinary nature yields a comprehensive cultural picture of the passions and concerns that make today’s Mexico so complex and fascinating.
Celebrate México Now Festival has successfully completed Indiegogo campaigns in past years to secure the support needed to continue this citywide cultural festival. Help us reach our goal in 2015! Check out the awesome perks we're offering and give now.

<h3>I graduated from college with a Major in Debt &amp; a Minor in Getting By...</h3>
<div>
<p>My first job out of college was in a large corporation, as a graphic designer. It was the first job I would have where I would be working in a cubicle. Someone took me up to the floor that I would be on, and I saw the mass of cubicles I reconized from ""Office Space"". My cubicle was down the isle where all of the rest of the Art Department worked. A sadness dreared over me as I passed each one, all with one common denominator. Unlike cubicles in say a software company, where maybe middle aged woman &amp; men display their the family life in cheap photo frames from Target, that they that had worked hard to support, as a reminder why they were there in the first place; the artists that occupied these cubicles had quite the opposite: All their cubicles were lined with all sorts of art; from traditional to modern, to graphics, to ads they enjoyed, to personal pieces they had made sometime when they did not exist there. They weren't reminders of why they were suffering through it. They were unfulfilled dreams, that they were not currently pursing. It disturbed me on a deep level. I carried feelings of remorse for them, as I walked down a fabricated corridor to what seemed would be my open grave . I didn't want to be in a place for 8 hours of my day where I stared at a life I wish I had. I knew I wouldn't work hard there, afterall, at the end of the day if I shipped a few extra units, I wouldn't see a dime - Where was my motivation? I quit that afternoon.</p>

<h3>More about ""The Waste Land"" Performance</h3>
<p>At 401 Richmond in Toronto, artist Jessica Bebenek translated T.S. Eliot's canonical long poem ""The Waste Land"" into a knitted tapestry as a part of Nuit Blanche's Independent Artist's program. She knit the 500-line poem over 12 hours, using a pattern she created by translating the stressed and unstressed beats of each line of poetry into lines of knit and purl stitches.</p>
<p>Eliot’s poem uses intentionally obscure language and references and was written to be understood only by his fellow male Modernists. What happens when Eliot’s coded language is translated into the coded language of a knitting pattern? By performing the hidden labour of knitting as a feat of endurance, Bebenek critiques the artificial divide between ‘fine arts’ &amp; ‘crafts’ and the systemic devaluation of ‘women’s work’.</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>One day you'll be able to buy the knitting pattern as a book (I hope!), but for now, please check out some of the books, knitted tapestries, and services I'm offering to the right.</p>

<h3>About Jess</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Jess, a poet and transdisciplinary artist who splits her time between Montreal and Toronto. I was a poet in the Toronto literary community for years before moving to Montreal to complete my MA in English &amp; Creative Writing. I've primarily written and published lyric poetry, but these days I'm fascinated by textile arts and the rich lineage of women &amp; folks reinventing the genre. My performance at Nuit Blanche even inspired me to work more in creating installation art!</p>
<p>I've edited poetry, short stories, and everything in between in more than eight university workshops, as well as a full novel. I've curated a reading series, run a small press publishing experimental poetry and other works. I've taught undergraduate classes and independent workshops, and continue to work as a programming coordinator at Concordia's Centre for Expanded Poetics, where I organized the Occult Poetics Symposium.</p>

<li>Travel: $200.57</li>
<li>Accommodation: $392.11</li>

<h2>Idiosyncrasy is a multifunctional art space located in Brooklyn, NY dedicated to bringing exposure to emerging artists.</h2>
<p> Upon moving to New York I was quickly amazed by the incredible amount of talent all around me.  It also didn't take long for me to discover that in a city full of want to be artists, designers, etc, most of us ""trying to make it"" creatives have at least two jobs: the one we do because we have to, typically the one that pays the rent, and then the one we do because we love it and because we can't seem to stop.  It's in this creative process and its culmination that many of us feel we find value.  It's such a shame every time I hear someone venting their frustrations about dedicating most of their energy to their job (whether it's working retail, waiting tables, bar tending, whatever) and having little left for the work they really care about.  In so many cases these are wonderfully talented individuals whose work, I know, would be well received if it could ever be seen or shown.  Therefore, I had the idea to create Idiosyncrasy.  A space that aims specifically to give emerging artists a chance to have their work seen in a quality venue. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>We're so close!</h3>
<p>We have successfully completed over 50% of the Idiosyncrasy art space.  So far, we've built several small studio spaces and a study/library that we're filling with resources for creatives.  All of this being said, we still have more to do! The basement of Idiosyncrasy contains a 900+square foot room that we are converting into a gallery/ exhibition space. We've already begun lining up some incredibly talented artists to install their work for solo shows this upcoming spring.  With each show, Idiosycnrasy will host an opening with refreshments and music.  This will give the artist a chance to add to his artist's cv and showcase his talent.  Meanwhile, it will give the public an opportunity to view and purchase these works at an affordable price.   <strong> To complete the gallery space, we intend to do the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Build and paint 2 large wall spaces for exhibition. Estimated cost:$1,600.</li>
<li>Add bathroom for gallery guests.  Just a simple slop sink and toilet.  Estimated cost: $2,500.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>If we are able to raise more funds than our goal (which we are really hoping for!!), we will do the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Redo the gallery floor (~900 sqft).  Nothing fancy, just something affordable and practical.</li>
<li>Add track lighting directed at the gallery exhibition walls. </li>
<li>Add an 8 foot awning to mark the exterior gallery entrance. </li>
<li>Purchase two projectors for the gallery.  These would be used for film screenings and video installations. </li>
<li>Purchase a large format printer for Idiosyncrasy.  This would be used for advertising and marketing for the gallery.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>What we can offer you:</h3>
<p>We're really excited about the gifts we have for contributors! </p>
<ul>
<li>For a donation of $25+ you will receive a subscription to our Idiosyncrasy digital magazine which will arrive to you via email 3 times annually and will showcase the gallery's newest talent and works from recent exhibitions.  </li>
<li>For a donation of $100+ you will receive a limited edition print of work by artist, Nick Reynolds, for whom idiosyncrasy is named in memory of.  His beautiful works include whimsical, vibrant watercolor and ink on paper.  Sized 8in x10in.</li>
<li>For a donation of $500+ you will receive a limited edition print of work by artist, Nick Reynolds, for whom idiosyncrasy is named in memory of.  His beautiful works include whimsical, vibrant watercolor and ink on paper.  Sized 11 in x14 in and custom framed.  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other ways you can help:</h3>
<p>We understand not everyone can contribute financially, but here are some other ways you can help out!</p>
<ul>
