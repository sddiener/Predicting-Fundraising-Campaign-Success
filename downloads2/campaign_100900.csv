<p>We set out to make the most versatile yet minimal backpack and duffel collection on the planet. The Quarter Century Backpack and Duffle are made from durable 12oz waxed canvas that can pack a punch, and are then constructed with premium leather and hardware trimmings. They’re tough enough for outdoor adventures yet sophisticated and functional for the everyday workplace.</p>

<p><strong>Many Thanks!</strong></p>
<p>1k of the Core êkö Cutlery Kits are made, ready-to-ship, to customers from our San Francisco, CA office. 2020 was a rollercoaster year for êkö product development, manufacturing, &amp; logistics beset with challenges &amp; delays since êkö is custom-designed &amp; brand new. êkö was supposed be ready by August 2020 but due to manufacturing and logistical delays beyond our control we just received the first 1k shipment at the very end of last year.</p>
<p>That said, êkö was in a way ""soft-launched"" to mostly family and friends on IndieGoGo since the shipping dates along with product development was challenging in 2020.  2021 will be better!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>EkoWareUSA® makes handy eco-friendly products. Our first launch is an ultra-portable eco-friendly flatware kit with clip-on wooden handles and a linen pouch. The idea came during a dive trip in SE Asia with eco-minded friends as a way to curb our reliance on single-use products which often ends up as pollution, or worse, in our oceans. We strive to help change this. êkö is also a safety measure during COVID for peace-of-mind whilst eating-out anytime, anywhere. </p>
<p>*If you'd like to pick up your order in San Francisco, CA we'll refund the shipping charge. Just contact us to arrange day, time, and location</p>
<p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606505293/nkf8d2srwumvba3lzxxp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Product Description:  </strong>The êkö flatware kit is designed to be a portable sustainable alternative to single-use flatware. It's also a COVID measure. The food-grade 304 stainless steel fork  and spoon set has grips slots that could also lock-in optional clip-on handles with a click of a button.  The Core êkö Kit is the  most compact offering while the Premium êkö Kit includes additional clip-on handles extension attachments. The flatware integrates soft serrations that can cut through cooked foods for both lefties and righties. A soft linen roll-up pouch wraps the kit small enough to fit easily into a pocket, bag, or purse. <i>The product is <strong>patent pending</strong> and trademarked.</i></p>
<p>We are based in San Francisco, CA, USA. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>EKO up and running! Hardware tooling and the carrying pouch are produced in Asia and we're making the handles here in San Francisco, CA. An initial production run of 1020 sets with pouches have been completed but some post-production finishing is needed and the optional clip-on handle tooling has to be slightly reconfigured. </p>
<p>The êkö concept, at its core, was originally designed to be a versatile compact personal cutlery kit as a convenient everyday carry solution. As such, our <strong>Core êkö Kit</strong> includes:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1609188933/n7axqgq97qm0pbt3tbyp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The <strong>Premium êkö Cutlery Kit</strong> below will include clip-on handles extensions crafted from lacquered wood and industrial plant-based plastic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1609191499/eo8zx1pc63t5nnsbhffk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The clip-on addition snaps into the metal êkö slots for compact carry and eating modes.  êkö slots lock-in handle extensions of different materials and lengths sold separately.</p>
<p><strong>êkö</strong> R&amp;D has been bootstrapped this past year with support from our friends, brand ambassadors, and manufacturing partners. Our goal is to make a sustainable, quality eating experience and form alliances with eco-friendly business partnerships in helping reduce our reliance on single-use flatware to help combat climate change. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Global Climate Change is real. <strong>êkö </strong>is designed as a sustainable alternative in a compact, re-usable, eco-friendly, stylish solution compared to disposable single-use flatware.</p>
<ul>
<li>The average American uses 240+ disposable single-use flatware a year. </li>
<li>1/3 of recyclable and compostable flatware ends up as litter or landfill. </li>
<li>Biodegradable flatware requires an additional industrial process to degrade.</li>
<li>Wood flatware uses trees and is leaves a high carbon footprint for a single-use item.</li>
<li>Millions of pieces of single-use cutlery are made each year.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>êkö </strong>is also a COVID-19 safety measure. As restaurants slowly open, bringing your own (BYO) everyday carry (EDC) personal êkö decreases potential virus/bacteria contact tracing.</p>

<li>The linen <strong>êkö </strong>pouch is machine or hand-washable..  </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The first 1020 stainless steel êkö cutlery sets and pouches are ready to go.  However, the crafted wood clip-on handles require hand finishing and assembling at our SF, CA workshop until we can get the funding necessary produce more handles at scale.</p>
<p>The process involves crafting the handles by laser cutting/engraving gorgeous real wood, 3d printing with PLA+ industrial grade plant-based filament, wood sanding/lacquering, and bonding of components.  Each initial êkö kit will come with 2 clip on handles. Additional handle options, upgrades, and replacements will be available for sale on our online storefront. êkö can be used without the clip-on handles, however, and in different carry configurations to make it more versatile in suiting your tastes as an everyday carry personal portable essential.</p>
<ul>
<li>1020 êkö metal sets with pouches are now in production. </li>
<li>Crafted Wood clip-on handles are made in SF, CA, USA for first 200 sets.</li>
<li>Your contribution will go to funding tooling/production of handles at scale &amp; lower cost.</li>
<li>Clip-on Handle upgrades and replacements will be made available via our online store.</li>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<h3>Remember Jessi Evans</h3>
<p>My name is Amber Handler.  I am the cousin of Jessi Evans. </p>
</div>
<p>Jessi Evans, 17, of Norris City IL was murdered while on a fishing trip with her boyfriend on the weekend of August 26, 2012 . Her boyfriend was also murdered on this trip.</p>
<p>This campaign is to raise money for Jessi’s mom to help her with funeral expenses and to pay for the time she needs off from her job for emotional healing.  By contributing to this fund you will be helping out a mother who has tragically lost her daughter. The local community has started fundraisers to help Jessi's mom, but we wanted those who have heard about her story from afar to be able to help as well. </p>
<p>She was born February 10, 1995 in Fairfield, IL. Jessi was entering her senior year of high school at NCOE. Jessi was a talented artist and loving aunt with many aspirations. She is loved and will be missed by the community, her friends and family. She was a wonderful light to all who met her, and her smile could brighten a room.<br/><br/>Jessi is survived by her mother Kris Evans, sister Megan Evans, nephew Miles Herrington, brother Ryan Evans, grandparents Jolean and Wesley Buzun, and grandparents Linda and Randal Godfrey, and many family and friends who miss her dearly.</p>
<p>We need around $2,000 in order to complete the burial costs for Jessi.  These funds will be going directly to Campbell Funeral Home in Norris City, IL and to Jessi’s mom. All monies raised beyond the funeral costs will go to Jessi's mother to be used how she needs</p>
<p>Even if you can't give, please help us get the word out. We can't bring Jessi back, but hopefully we can make the financial burden a little easier for her mother.</p>
<p>We need the money soon, so please use the tools on the Indiegogo website to spread the word!</p></div>","Remember Jessi Evans

El día 15 de Octubre dio comienzo nuestro
viaje fotográfico a través de Santo Domingo (Rep. Dominicana) y San José (Costa
Rica). Éstas serán las dos primeras etapas del proyecto
""citysense/mag"". 
""citysense/mag"" es una revista
fotográfica de viajes que tiene como protagonistas los habitantes de las
ciudades que visitamos, sus historias y sus experiencias. 
Somos un equipo internacional formado por 4
fotógrafos profesionales: Joana, Roberto, Andrea y Klaudia. Nos conocimos este
año en una de las mejores escuelas de fotografía de España y nuestra intención
es crear algo a partir de la pasión que compartimos por los viajes, la
fotografía y el periodismo.
En el contexto actual del mundo de la fotografía,
en el que es cada vez más difícil encontrar un trabajo, hemos decidido crear
nuestra propia revista para poder lograr el sueño de viajar por el mundo con
nuestras cámaras. 
Cada número de ""citysense/mag""
recopilará las historias de los habitantes de una ciudad. El primer número de
la revista estará dedicado a Santo Domingo, capital de la República Dominicana,
y saldrá en el mes de Enero de 2014. El segundo número estará dedicado a San
José de Costa Rica, y está previsto que salga en Marzo de 2014.
Desde nuestro blog http://citysensemag.wordpress.com podrás seguir día a día nuestro
proceso de trabajo así como nuestras experiencias.
 

What is ""citysense/mag""?

On October 15th began our photographic journey
through Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic and San José, Costa Rica, which
comprise the first two phases of the ""citisense/mag"" project.
""citysense/mag"" is a photographic travel
magazine which has as its lead characters the inhabitants of the cities which
we visit, together with their stories and experiences.
We are an international team of photographers
formed by four professional photographers: Joana, Roberto, Andrea and Klaudia.
We met this year (2013) in one of the best photography schools in Spain and our
intention is to create something from the passion we share for travel,
photography and journalism.
In today's world of photography, in which it is
becoming more and more difficult to get employment, we have decided to create
our own magazine in order to fulfill our dream of traveling the world with our
cameras.
Each issue of ""citysense/mag"" will
gather the stories of the inhabitants of a city. The first issue will be
dedicated to Santo Domingo, capital of the Dominican Republic, and will be
issued in January, 2014. The second issue will be dedicated to San José, the
capital of Costa Rica, and it is expected to be released in March, 2014.
In our blog http://citysensemag.wordpress.com you
can follow our work process as well as our experiences.

¿Que necesitamos?
Hemos abierto esta página de crowdfunding para
apoyar económicamente en la producción y ejecución de la primera fase de
nuestro proyecto.
Esta financiación servirá para ayudarnos con la
impresión de las revistas, con posibles aplicaciones multimedia y con
diferentes gastos relacionados con el equipo técnico.
Según sea tu contribución podrás recibir
diferentes recompensas, desde postales con nuestras fotos enviadas directamente
desde las ciudades en las que nos encontramos, hasta las copias impresas de la
revista. Si eres una empresa, una asociación, un centro educativo o una ONG y
estas interesado en apoyar nuestro proyecto, ofrecemos también la posibilidad
de poner tu logo en nuestro blog, en la revista y en los vídeos realizados
durante los viajes. También incluiremos en nuestro blog algunos posts dedicados
a tu empresa o asociación.
 
Con nuestro budget inicial llegaremos a concluir
el viaje el 15 de Diciembre en San José de Costa Rica. A partir de entonces
empezará la fase de postproducción e impresión de la revista. 
Con los fondos que vamos a recaudar no pensamos
alojarnos en un hotel 5 estrellas ni tampoco salir a comer langosta, sino que
serán utilizados para cubrir los gastos del seguro del equipo, para el tiraje
de las primeras copias de la revista y para la creación de posibles
aplicaciones multimedia.
 
Hemos optado por una financiación flexible, es
decir, que si no llegamos al objetivo de 4000€ que hemos fijado, obtendremos
igualmente las recaudaciones y adaptaremos el tipo de seguro y el numero de
copias impresas al budget logrado. 
 
 

What do we need?

We have opened this crowdfunding page in order to
support economically the first production and execution of the first phase of
our project. This financing will serve to help us with the printing of
magazines, possible multimedia applications, and with expenses related to
technical equipment.
As a contributor, you can receive different

working, to actual printed copies of the magazine. If you represent a business,
an association, an education institution, or an NGO and you are interested in

We plan to conclude our first trip, with the help of our initial budget, on
December 15th in San José, Costa Rica. From the on, the post-production and

With these funds which we will gather, we are not
planning to stay in five-star hotels or eat lobster every day! They will rather
be used for insuring our equipment, for printing the first issues of the
magazine, and for creating possible multimedia applications.
We have chosen a flexible financing goal, meaning,
that if we do not reach our set goal of 4000€, we will likewise keep the
donations and then adapt the insurance and number of printed copies to the
achieved budget.

</div>","The Cause:


Access to solar lighting is so important to rural areas. Solar lighting replaces inefficient, expensive kerosene lamps which most Tanzanians are reliant upon. These lamps are dangerous and a respiratory hazard. Nobody should have to jeopardize their health when turning on a light!
The
Difference You Make:


Ninty-five percent of rural households in Tanzania have no electricity at all.  A single solar-electric LED lighting kit has an immediate, immensely positive effect.
We will demonstrate this change; the health, economic, educational and environmental benefits a family experiences.  Our goal is to raise awareness of the importance of solar energy for the families of rural Tanzania, and help the international community understand how we can implement positive change.











About Myself:    
My name is Anna Geyer.  I am a film and video maker.  I make both commercial instructional videos and 16mm experimental films. My films have screened in numerous festivals internationally. I have been asked to shoot this piece and am looking forward to the experience. 
What Your Money Does:The video will inform the audience about the challenges of life in a rural Tanzanian village and the extent to which solar energy can provide solutions.
When I was asked by Africa Solar Fund to shoot this piece, I immediately became excited. This is an opportunity to  share an unknown story with the rest of the world and in doing so people will learn how they can make a difference. It’s an issue to which a simple solution already exists.
  
Awareness of Africa Solar Fund is paramount to its fundraising goals.  Africa Solar Fund awards and administers grants to support East African nonprofit organizations working with villagers, healthcare clinics, hospitals, schools and other public and private institutions.




The Budget
Will Cover: 

1)   Airfare and travel and expenses.        
2)   Hiring a local production crew.
3)   Equipment rental, insurance and shooting expenses.

The production itself should be challenging, and I’m up for it! We plan to shoot over a five-day period. All local personnel will receive payment.  I will travel with a minimum of equipment but must prepare for having little access to electricity.
 
Stretch Goal:    
 When our goal is met the surplus will be applied to the cost of post-production and then to provide solar lights to Tanzanian families.

We believe Love paid a price that made us all valuable yet equal. Everyone has intrinsic value and deserves to be appreciated and valued. Love Bought International has started an Orphan Revolution. Our goal is to turn orphans into Sons and Daughters.</p>
<p>Love Bought is lead by Mike &amp; Lidiette Rosas...along with a team of world changers who are too numerous to mention but the work could not be done without them. GOD has put it on our hearts to fight for the orphan and help save their lives. We are a 501c3 organization in good status with the IRS. Our hearts are drawn to Colombia because of their massive need, over 500,000 orphans, and the fact that they have been in a 40 year civil war. With the need so great we tend to ask, ""What can I really do?"" Eventually we have to come to the reality that regardless of how big or small the impact, we must do something.</p>
<p>We began 7 years ago with a soup kitchen in Bogota, Colombia feeding and educating up to 125 children a day. As we saw the children grow, we noticed they'd stop coming to our soup kitchen as they approached their teen years. Soon after many would become village prostitutes and even get recruited by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). We felt like more had to be done to ensure these children would grow up better than what their surroundings offered and taught them. Giving the children a full time home was our only logical option to help them get out of the cycle of death that they were in.</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>Our goal is to build an orphanage and school for 400+ children. Last November, we  put a $25,000 down payment on 5 1/2 acres of land in Tunja, Colombia just north of Bogota. The owners of the land have graciously given us 8 months to pay off the debt. Since the down payment was given we have raised an additional $50,000 which leaves us with a remaining balance of $125,000 due by April 30th. 100% of your donations will be used to pay off the balance of the land. Our Indiegogo goal of $20,000 in conjunction with other fundraisers will help us pay off the land in full!! </p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Paying off the land will allow us to commence the building phase which over time will take 400+ children off the streets and give them a home. In Colombia the orphans are known to many as ""The Disposables""...our goal is to show them how valuable they are by giving them the home and love they desperately long for. There are millions of orphans around the world, a problem which seems impossible to solve. However, the truth is that these children are individuals and not just a statistic. You may think of this as a project to house 400+ orphans, but rather think of it as John, Suzie, Michael and Sarah being swept up and rescued of the streets! For us it's not just about doing a good deed, but saving a life. This is our life's work! We will stop at nothing to help the poor, the orphan, the forgotten and the unloved. Were not this multi-billion dollar corporation. Were just a couple of people who are crazy enough to think we can change the world!</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Truth</h3> <p>In all honesty were in over our heads! There's a problem here that is much bigger than us...but we can't just sit around waiting to be qualified to help. These children need us. We feel like with GOD and your help, we can change the world. We have no other option that to succeed. This amount of money is more than we have ever raised in a year, but we won't let that stop us.

<p>By day, digital developer; by night, rock-climber; and when on annual leave, marathoner, adventurer and mountaineer.</p>
<p>By 2015, with your help, I’m hoping to ascend to the summit of Mount Everest with Team Everest (Singapore). Our aim is to represent Singaporeans, to bring our little nation to the peak of Mount Everest on her 50th birthday, and celebrate her independence.</p>
<p>Our climb is symbolic of our country’s ascent from colony to republic, from third to first world, from disparate to united, from 1965 to 2015.</p>
<p>We climb for country and people and we’re hoping to make the 9th of August 2015, a day to remember.</p>

<p></p></span></span></div>","Show your support for Hilwan, who’s taking on earth’s highest mountain with Team Everest (Singapore) 2015.
By day, digital developer; by night, rock-climber; and when on annual leave, marathoner, adventurer and mountaineer.
By 2015, with your help, I’m hoping to ascend to the summit of Mount Everest with Team Everest (Singapore). Our aim is to represent Singaporeans, to bring our little nation to the peak of Mount Everest on her 50th birthday, and celebrate her independence.
Our climb is symbolic of our country’s ascent from colony to republic, from third to first world, from disparate to united, from 1965 to 2015.
We climb for country and people and we’re hoping to make the 9th of August 2015, a day to remember.



 

 
How can you help?
Help to fund Hilwan’s gear, acclimatisation climbs, mountaineering permits and fees, and logistical costs for Everest. 

On the summit of Mera Peak (6400m) in 2012
 
A short history of money
Since the formation of Team Everest (Singapore) in 2010, our climbing equipment and training expeditions have been self-funded.
We’ve used our savings, our parents’ savings, and all our lunch money to fund our dream of summiting Everest.
Contrary to popular belief, we’re not funded by government agencies. We’ve approached many to ask for sponsorship but response has been lukewarm. So far, we’ve received many pats on our backs but we’ve never received any money.  
Despite this, we’ve continued to train for Everest, going on one self-funded expedition at a time. So far, we’ve summited 4 peaks and an ice climbing course, and spent a total of S$10864 each –


Malaysia, Mount Kinabalu, 4095m – S$800

India, Mount Shiti Dhar, 5251m – S$3334

Nepal, Mera Peak, 6467m and Island Peak, 6189m – S$4089

China, Ice Climbing Course – S$2641

Total Spent on Expeditions: S$10,864
We’re determined to fund ourselves and carry on with our training expeditions in preparation for the summit in 2015. We just need your help with our individual summit gear, acclimatisation expeditions, and mountaineering outfitter fee.
 
 
Where will your money go?
Remaining gear, S$3000

Down suit, S$1000 – To keep warm, but mostly to stay alive.
8000m climbing boots, S$1000 – Because climbing on ice is impossible with sneakers.
Oxygen masks and tanks, S$1000 – Because when you’re at this altitude, there’s only about a third as much oxygen to breathe.

6000m China Chengdu Ice Climbing Course, S$3000 – A requirement to be proficient on ice before attempting the next ascent.
8201m China Cho Oyu, S$14000 – Another requirement before the final push to the summit.

That’s a lot of money so I need a lot of help.

Let’s break it down, All you have to do is put your SIM Card into VoxEra (make sure your device is connected to the Internet before you go) and you’ll be on your merry way. When you reach your destination, wherever that may be, just connect to the Internet through WiFi or data and open the VoxEra app. Here, you’ll be able to call and text with the highest quality connection.And the best part? You can do all of this without the dread of receiving your phone bill. So whether you want to wish your mom a happy birthday, share your adventures abroad with friends, or get in touch with clients, VoxEra helps you stay in the conversation as if you never left!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491925024/wmxg8ldpey84e5rldfjc.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Stay connected anywhere anytime</strong></p><p>Wherever you are, with VoxEra you will be always connected, VoxEra works everywhere, during flights, Cruises, Even in the middle of nowhere ,all what you need is an internet connection.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491925084/hnxw8nmgcjztlts1r9ni.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Why VoxEra is the best solution for roaming?</strong></p><p>There are a lot of apps for calling and texting while traveling. The problem with those roaming apps is that the recipient of your call or text needs to have a smartphone, download the app, and be connected to WiFi (or use a ton of data) to receive your message. VoxEra patent-pending technology , on the other hand, is completely different! for few reasons:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491925119/tywgv1bqea1nlhak7r3t.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p><p>Think of VoxEra as a message converter.

And get this: 64% of that revenue was made just by voice roaming fees, alone. Researchers predict that the hefty chunk of change will increase to $90 billion USD by 2018.</p><p>Ready for more numbers? Eighty-eight percent of travelers pay more than $100/month in roaming fees. And, despite all of those cool VoIP apps and online messaging, these individuals are still using their original cell numbers abroad.</p><p>Not only do individuals pay more than enough in roaming charges, but also businesses are losing money by reimbursing their employees for roaming fees.

Let’s break it down, All you have to do is put your SIM Card into VoxEra (make sure your device is connected to the Internet before you go) and you’ll be on your merry way. When you reach your destination, wherever that may be, just connect to the Internet through WiFi or data and open the VoxEra app. Here, you’ll be able to call and text with the highest quality connection.And the best part? You can do all of this without the dread of receiving your phone bill. So whether you want to wish your mom a happy birthday, share your adventures abroad with friends, or get in touch with clients, VoxEra helps you stay in the conversation as if you never left!Stay connected anywhere anytimeWherever you are, with VoxEra you will be always connected, VoxEra works everywhere, during flights, Cruises, Even in the middle of nowhere ,all what you need is an internet connection.Why VoxEra is the best solution for roaming?There are a lot of apps for calling and texting while traveling. The problem with those roaming apps is that the recipient of your call or text needs to have a smartphone, download the app, and be connected to WiFi (or use a ton of data) to receive your message. VoxEra patent-pending technology , on the other hand, is completely different! for few reasons:How does it work?Think of VoxEra as a message converter. When you receive a call, VoxEra receives a GSM call and then converts it into a VoIP call. It then sends that converted message to the Cloud through the Internet. In the same way, when making a call, VoxEra sends a message through the Cloud. When the device has received the message, our device converts it into a GSM call, at which point, it is delivered to the number you’ve dialed. Easy, right? Sending and receiving calls​Sending and receiving SMSs But don’t just take our word for it!Testing VoxEra from GeorgiaTesting VoxEra from CairoWho's it for?VoxEra’s technology is simple yet brilliant, because It is suitable both for short and long travel. It’s designed for Prototype developmentWhat is GigSky ?GigSky is a world data SIM that provides 3G/4G Internet in 90 countries with the most affordable prices. GigSky SIM card comes with 100MB Free Internet included. That's enough to make 500 minutes calls with VoxEra. Why GigSky?Because of its worldwide coverage and low prices GigSky prices are as low as $0.01 per MB in Europe, $0.05 per MB in Americas, $0.05 per MB for Asia Pacific and $0.10 per MB in Middle East/ Africa. GigSky SIM card is compatible with any phone or tablet.you can get more information about GigSkyhttps://www.gigsky.comAccording to statisticsMost phone companies address their roaming charges with hard-to-read phrasing and hidden fees. And trust us, we’ve done our research. Believe it or not, over 1.2 billion people travel per year and every month 29 million people use mobile roaming while abroad. According to a study by JuniperResearch, cell phone companies in 2013 made $57 billion USD. And get this: 64% of that revenue was made just by voice roaming fees, alone. Researchers predict that the hefty chunk of change will increase to $90 billion USD by 2018.Ready for more numbers? Eighty-eight percent of travelers pay more than $100/month in roaming fees. And, despite all of those cool VoIP apps and online messaging, these individuals are still using their original cell numbers abroad.Not only do individuals pay more than enough in roaming charges, but also businesses are losing money by reimbursing their employees for roaming fees. A 2012 CCMI survey found that more than a third of Fortune 1000 companies spend over $1,000/ month on roaming charges per employee they send abroad.So there you have it. Whether you’re traveling for work, or for pleasure, VoxEra will save you the hundreds or even thousands of dollars that come from roaming fees. A mind blowing deviceWhat about Security?Your privacy is important to us. All of your calls made through VoxEra are encrypted, making this product 100% secure. So go ahead and talk business—no one else is listening! RewardsHow can you get internet?There are many ways to find an Internet connection abroad, but they can be difficult to spot if you’re new to the area. Don’t worry, we’ve got you covered! Check out this map to find a location nearest you with accessible Free WiFi.How did we come up with idea?I am a man of technology who fell in love with a woman of travel. When we got married, I promised her that we could travel twice a year three months as long as I could check in at work every now and then, between our adventures. Our first trip was magical and she allowed me (as part of our deal) to call my clients and my work team during our time abroad. However, upon returning, my phone bill littered with roaming charges was anything but magical. So in order to uphold my promise without worrying about the cost of staying connected. I searched for a solution, but found no answers.In my research, I realized that majority of the travel community faced the same issue; the price to stay connected to home, to loved ones, and to work was too much. I was determined to keep my promise to the woman I love, so I used my love of technology to create VoxEra in hopes that I, and everyone else who decided to use this device, could stay connected.This is, of all things, a true love story.As a team, what sets us apart?We care about our investors and the travelers who use our product. We aren’t just trying to sell; we want to address the growing issue of roaming fees.We have a passion for travel and for technology. We want you to stay connected to home easily, and without cost.Our plan and execution are entirely different. We’ve designed VoxEra to adapt to the flexibility of travel so that you can reach whomever, whenever. We have the experience, and we’ve done our research! We are confident that VoxEra will help eliminate the ridiculous roaming charges, and overall, help the traveling community.VoxEra in the NewsDo you have any questions?Ask away! send us a message or post a comment and we'll do our best to get back to you with an answer.or Feedback?Got a creative idea you think we should implement with VoxEra?

<p><b>4 Detachable spinner wheels </b>Every Rollux suitcase comes with 4 removable spinner wheels, which easily move around and wheel along floors. The removable wheels are made to be durable, so they withstand all the scraping, dragging and lugging involved in traveling. Being able to remove the wheels of your bag allows you to protect the wheels as they are delicate and often the first thing that gets damaged on suitcases. The wheels of the bag are secure and sturdy, but if necessary, may be removed. This ensures a proper fit in overhead compartments and fits necessary airlines requirements.</p>

<p><b>Materials used </b>We sourced the best material for our bags. Every Rollux is made out of an elastic fabric that allows you to get the most amount of clothes into the allowed suitcase size.

The fixed metals at each corner provide stability and durability so that all parts will be secure and strong.</p>

Last year we brought Qubix1 right here to Indiegogo and successfully delivered over 30,000 cubes to our backers alone. Since then, we served over 10,000 happy customers around the world. Your incredible support and feedback inspired us to take the double compression packing cube family to the next level.  
 
We all know the pain of a messy luggage! Packing can be a struggle, especially when trying to fit in all your essentials. 
 

 
When you finally arrive at your destination after a long trip, dealing with the dread of unpacking is the last thing you ever want to be doing.   Lost items, creased clothes, scruffy shoes, tangled cables and all the rest...  
 
 
Now you can finally say goodbye to the dreadful task and epic waste of time that is unpacking!
  Thanks to Qubix2’s hook and hang system, you can unpack your entire suitcase in a matter of seconds.  Simply hook and hang your cubes on the rail, on a hanger, or anywhere you want!  Getting access to your clothes is an absolute breeze. Simply unzip your cube (even without de-compressing it) and… voilà!  Oh and did we mention? The hook and hang system doubles as a carrying handle.  So you can grab your cubes with ease, anytime and anywhere.  The double compression zipper is a revolution in packing efficiency.  The centre compression zipper wraps twice around each cube, giving you the added flexibility of a 2 level compression. Qubix2 features a new super lightweight RipStop parachute fabric that is woven using a special reinforcing technique, making it resistant to tearing and ripping.  And as the name suggests, skydivers trust it to keep them safe at 15,000 ft. So you know you can trust it on your travels!  In a nutshell, if you want super durable packing cubes, that’s exactly what you get when backing Qubix2.  Whether you roll or fold, the folding board keeps your cubes flat and flush when zipped and compressed.  SEE QUBIX2 IN ACTION FOR YOURSELF.

 
*Image inspired courtesy of backer Michelle H. <3  The Qubix2 Toiletry Cube is epic, and is one of our proudest upgrades! It has a retractable hook you can use to hang it anywhere.  It comes with an optimised pocket configuration of different sizes for complete versatility.  So you can fit all your favourite grooming items. No seriously, I mean aaaaaaaall of them, and then some!?  To make it even better, the Toiletry Cube is made with waterproof material. Aaaaand it comes with a tear-away pouch and a waterproof zipper.   You can even hang it in the shower using its very own integrated hook and hang strap.    This is the newest addition to the Qubix family. It's optimized to hold and organise your electronics in an efficient and compact way. It can comfortably fit all your cables, chargers, gadgets and accessories. The outside walls are lightly padded to offer extra protection for your valuables. Keep all your tech accessories neatly organised and easily reachable in one place. And say goodbye to damaged gear and messy cables forever.  We wanted the laundry bag to be discreet yet super useful.   So we made it double the size compared to Qubix1.  And it folds so tiny, you won’t even know it’s there until you need it.  No one wants the dirt and grime from the pavement rubbing against their clothes!   Universal sizes are made to fit pretty much every hand luggage, suitcase, or backpack. HEAR WHAT QUBIX2 BETA TESTERS HAD TO SAY... PRESS PLAY!  In the highly unlikely case you encounter an issue with your cubes, all you have to do is contact us. We trust our backers and promise to resolve any issues as fast as possible.

Waverly Labs is at the convergence of wearable technology + machine translation, developing the world's first smart earpiece language translator.
Using the latest technologies in speech recognition, machine translation and the advances of wearable technology, our smart earpiece allows wearers to speak different languages but still clearly understand each other. Simply put, when one person speaks, the other hears it in their language. Science fiction has called it many things, but we call it Pilot. 
 
    Will it translate everything around me?NO. This first generation does not translate everything happening around you. It only translates with people who also have the Pilot earpiece. Future generations will be developed to translate everything around you. What if the other person doesn’t have an earpiece? The full system comes with 2 earpieces for sharing during conversation with someone else. If someone does not have an earpiece, they can use the smartphone app which is included. Also, the app can be used as a loudspeaker during conference mode. How fast is it? Currently the translation only takes a couple of seconds of delay, but we are working very hard to get this lag shorter and we will release updates to the app with every improvement. Is the translation perfect? No, machine translation is not perfect and it will make mistakes sometimes, but the more people use it the better the translation engine becomes. Can it be used offline? We are developing an offline version so that you can use it while traveling overseas without a data connection. However this may be a later stage version of the app. The first version of the app will require online connectivity. We anticipate the offline use to be available by fall/winter 2017. When will the app be delivered? An early version of the translation app is expected this summer (August 2016) for basic translation. It will be the first iteration and allow for testing with our current backers throughout the year as we perfect the experience. This is included in your pre-order. The full app system with the Pilot earpieces will be delivered in May 2017.  What languages will be supported?We are first introducing latin/romance languages this summer (English, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese). Expected additional languages ase as follows: (*subject to change)Germanic: German, Danish, SwedishRussian and Slovak: Russian, Ukrainian, Czech, PolishHebrew/ArabicEast Asian: Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, Korean, VietnameseHindi and UrduAfrican: Afrikaans  Are these the ONLY languages which Waverly Labs will release?NO. We expect to investigate a wide array of languages, including those which are not listed. We'll listen to the feedback of our community to prioritize other languages throughout our development. Are additional languages free?Only for backers on Indiegogo. For everyone else, additional language packs will be available for a premium fee, Will it translate for my dialect? Every language has various dialects and the earpiece is designed to translate common dialects, although thick accents could disrupt this and cause improper translations.  Will the app work with other smart earpieces?No. The app and Pilot are designed to work together using specific communication protocols. When will the earpieces be delivered?The earpieces require much more testing, manufacturing and production time. Therefore, we anticipate the earliest will be Christmas, although this is an aggressive timeline. Backers should be prepared to have orders fulfilled next spring 2017. Where will you ship? We will ship internationally, and shipping costs are automatically calculated when you preorder. When will I select my colors? We will send you an online form to collect your color preference later this fall. Do you have a working prototype? Yes! We’ve prototyped the software to allow for two people to carry a conversation using the app. The next stages of the software development will focus on building a scalable infrastructure of the system to support a large number of users. The Pilot earpieces have gone through several stages of the hardware prototyping, including component selection, pcb design and industrial design. The full system of hardware and software development begins this summer as we move into the engineering validation testing phase. Can I be a beta tester? We will invite a select group of the early bird supporters to become beta testers. This will be invite only based on certain factors, such as languages, geography and use cases. We’ll send a notice later this fall to allow for beta test submissions. Are the earpieces waterproof? No. How can I reach out to your team?We are developing a community portal on our website to get to know you! In the meantime, message us on facebook and we’ll be sure to respond as soon as possible. I’m having trouble making a contribution. What should I do? Email support@indiegogo.com",8.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<p>Our orsen snorkel mask with airfresh system can reduce the carbon dioxide concentration below 800ppm,which is a reliable indoor carbon dioxide content range, while other masks have a carbon dioxide concentration of more than 6000ppm, which poses a great threat to life.     When snorkeling, you can breathe the way you do naturally with both nose and mouth by using our Orsen Airfresh snorkel mask, featuringan innovative airflow exchange system. You don't need to exhale and inhale very hard as our airflow exchange system will automatically let air circulate in and out. This creates an airflow with reduced resistance, allowing more fresh air to circulate through the mask and thus preventing CO2 buildup. No safety issue anymore! Our masks can even be used regularly without the Airfresh system.</p>

After searching far and wide for the perfect way to organize these items, we found that the existing options were not very durable, tend to soak up water and grime over time, and didn't keep our things organized very well. <strong>We knew there had to be a better way.</strong></p>

<p>Our mission with this project, as with all our projects, is to create something creative and interesting that involves the people and place we will be donating part of the profits to. A product that not only engages us, but people of all ages and walks of life, as well as providing the consumer with something creative that not only involves them in the project, but draws them in. The Road to Baja, will take us on a 12-day trip through Baja California on a 1974 Yamaha DT360 with a modified surf rack. On a mission to map the road through Baja with photographs. We will take the photos and compile them into a selection of prints, a coffee table style photo book with each photo having an attached GPS location, and a short documentary. We will be donating fifty percent of the profits from the book and print sales to orphanages in Baja California. The Road to Baja, is just the beginning. We plan on doing similar projects, mapping the road all the way through central America, with every project taking on a personality and voice of its' own, reflecting the unique people and places we come across. Every project by, The Open Road Project, will be donating fifty percent of the profits to the people in whatever area is documented by the project.</p>

</div></div>","Our mission with this project, as with all our projects, is to create something creative and interesting that involves the people and place we will be donating part of the profits to. A product that not only engages us, but people of all ages and walks of life, as well as providing the consumer with something creative that not only involves them in the project, but draws them in. The Road to Baja, will take us on a 12-day trip through Baja California on a 1974 Yamaha DT360 with a modified surf rack. On a mission to map the road through Baja with photographs. We will take the photos and compile them into a selection of prints, a coffee table style photo book with each photo having an attached GPS location, and a short documentary. We will be donating fifty percent of the profits from the book and print sales to orphanages in Baja California. The Road to Baja, is just the beginning. We plan on doing similar projects, mapping the road all the way through central America, with every project taking on a personality and voice of its' own, reflecting the unique people and places we come across. Every project by, The Open Road Project, will be donating fifty percent of the profits to the people in whatever area is documented by the project.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Finally, a wheelchair that lets people with mobility challenges get off the beaten path.</h3>
<p>The AdvenChair Off-Road Wheelchair is a game-changing, human-powered vehicle that will allow people with mobility challenges to comfortably travel off of hard surfaces and onto rugged trails, sand, and snow.</p>
<p>With its ergonomic design and lightweight harness, a team of one to five people can navigate the AdvenChair over rocky, soft, or steep terrain with the comfort and protection of a wheelchair, as well as the stability and durability of a mountain bike. At the same time, its removable front wheel, adjustable handlebars, small casters, and sleek design allow the AdvenChair to easily pass through doorways and maneuver indoors, or to be folded for transport in the trunk of a car.  <br/><br/><strong>ADVENCHAIR 2.0:</strong><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541715165/bhccukspmcepcsvdm2ut.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area, we have seen a growing housing shortage as our valley transitioned from an agrarian society into the computer age and technology. Artificial Intelligence is beginning to drive some of our cars, we are saving photos and important documents to share in The Cloud, our phones allow us to do what it used to take a room full of computers. Simple supply and demand has driven those with average incomes in search of cheaper housing out of the valley and even out of state. Business still needs to be done face-to-face at times, so business travelers fly in a few days at a time and then when there are conventions, when the few hotels there are multiply their high rates many times the usual high price.  What is going on in our childhood home in Silicon Valley is a microcosm of several metropolitan cities.</p>
<p>Travel nurses are also becoming common, requiring stays away from their home city for 30 days to six months. In our area alone, in the past 12 months there have been 15,673 searches by travel nurses to find a room in one of only 200 properties posted on one platform. </p>
<p>Beyond business, our area has many other great reasons to visit: beaches, concerts, weddings, funerals, reunions, and more, when travelers prefer to stay in a home environment where they can cook and relax in comfort, like they can't find in a sterile hotel.  In a home you don't have to overhear bachelor parties, drunk guests, anyone keeping a different schedule than you need or want. Staying in one of our properties, whether in the Bay Area or elsewhere, will give you that home away from home experience.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Steve: </strong>With 36 years in the trades, from landscaping to plumbing &amp; electrical, etc. (18 years as a general contractor), Steve spent years in property management and design/build. A high level of customer service has always been his forte.</p>
<p><strong>Bobbi:</strong> As an Executive Assistant for many industries for over 30 years supporting executives, Bobbi discovered her own drive toward entrepreneurial pursuits.  She loves refurbishing furniture and decorating homes and getting fresh ideas from HGTV.</p>
<p><strong>Together:</strong> Bobbi &amp; Steve have been a team since high school, married for 35 years, working together and traveling together (Canada &amp; Mexico, England, Czech &amp; Slovak Republics, Tanzania, The Netherlands) and hosting international students from all over the world for short visits or year-long visits has been a passion. The past two years we have been hosting in our home a friend who travels from his home in Oregon to work for a week or two at a time.  He compares our guest room to other Air BnBs he has stayed in and says we rank at the top.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need your help to launch our solution to travelers' desire to be able to relax in a quiet and comfortable environment. To get our network started, for our first 2-3 rentals including furnishings, we estimate will cost about $60,000. Bobbi is a master at gathering free and used furnishings and repurposing them and Steve is a great help with that. After we get three short-term rental properties going, we hope the net profit will allow us to add more properties. Our goal is to have 20-30 properties scattered throughout the Bay Area/SF/Santa Cruz, Monterey/Carmel, Lake Tahoe, San Diego and Disneyland Area (maybe popular areas in LA), Orlando, Texas, Nashville, and beyond. Your input for future locations is welcome, too!</li>
<li>Our perks are very useful.  Basically, you receive half your donation in discounts for a future stay beginning March 1, 2020 and never expiring.</li>
<li>Of course, we would love your help getting the word out about not only our 40-day crowdfunding campaign, but also as you stay in our properties, share with your friends and family about how you like the. Think local: friends and family for weddings, funerals, reunions, holidays and other family gatherings, etc., and then as you travel to your some of favorite destinations we may have properties there. The wonderful thing about a home is the limits on numbers like in a hotel room are not so stringent. Instead of only four, you can house 6-8 or more in a three bedroom house and more in a larger home.</li>
<li>Traditionally, for VRBO or Air BnB rentals, the owner is the one who posts and manages the rental. We are using a new model which has been successful for others we know, leasing rental properties with full knowledge and acceptance of property owners and actively managing the maid service, maintenance, master scheduling even employing a 24/7 Virtual Front Desk, and amenities.  This is our business and we will treat it as such, offering the personal touches that bring our travelers back time and again.</li>
</ul>
<p>Benefits to property owners: </p>
<ul>
<li>no emergency calls (our maintenance teams handle all repairs under $100 free and manage after approval any maintenance that must be done</li>
<li>no worries about late rent (income from short-term renters more than covers all expenses)</li>
<li>professional cleaning each week for longer stays and definitely between guests upon check out</li>
<li>no funky paint colors, satellite dishes or unruly pets or children</li>
<li>no broken down cars or RVs in the driveway or on the street </li>
<li>yards are professionally maintained</li>
<li>insurance policies carried by us cover accidental damages</li>
<li>we inspect each property several times a year, and weekly maid service regularly notifies us of any repairs or upgrades that need to happen</li>
<li>Not only will we be locating our short-term rentals in areas near universities and hospitals for students and professors and nurses, but hotels spend millions of dollars researching where to place their hotels so we will follow locations where there are hotels, of course offering our rooms much below the cost of hotels to help us judge the best locations to add properties. </li>

<p>The <strong>aqua</strong>bionic<strong> abs</strong> system is the result of a 3 year development process with the goal of creating a standardized, rock-solid binding interface between a boot and a fin-blade.</p>
<p>Inspired by progress made in similar applications in modern alpine skiing and in Shimano’s SPD bicycle pedal-binding-system we applied these same quality and performance standards to the <strong>abs</strong> system.</p>
<p>With our background in developing technology for the ski industry, collaboration with a leading manufacturer of ski-binding components in Austria was the logical choice- ultimately resulting in the realization of our intrinsically safe <strong>Y-frame </strong>binding system.</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525391499/hswkqqcrvcxh45zmfmpz.png"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3>Changing the way diving fins will be used in the future! </h3>
<p>During the last 6 years of distributing our <strong>aqua</strong>bionic1 fins- we learned that regardless of how progressive or efficient in design, with the standard model of fins the underlaying problems in fit, handling and performance persist.</p>
<p>By introducing the <strong>aqua</strong>bionic <strong>abs</strong> system we proved that there is better technology than the outdated solution of using foot-pockets. </p>
<p>Our protected slogan ‘ technically barefoot’ paraphrases our aspiration to create the perfect balance between physical requirements, ultimate user friendliness and design.</p>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525453328/okvlc84ccjhkz649do1k.png"" src=""""/></p></div>

<p>Due to the elimination of all material not contributing to thrust, the <strong>abs</strong> system <strong>weighs up to 35% less</strong> than the average open heel fin. This increases efficiency due to the reduction of accelerated mass on the up- and downstroke during finning. The system eliminates standard foot-pockets, diving booties and heel-straps while delivering unsurpassed comfort, performance and safety. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525638526/hznvsgpxar2v8gxqojdn.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p><strong>The replacement of basic ‘foot-pockets’</strong> with sophisticated technical footwear - the logical step in the evolution of diving fins. Our abs aquatic hybrid boots feature sole integrated technology that distributes blade forces homogenously into the “system diver”- without stressing or constraining the foot. Special boot uppers stabilize and cushion to provide a comfortable and secure fit, both on the ground and in the water.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525539473/wcanrgdrdaplvdy4tuzh.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Ergonomically and functionally advanced <strong>abs</strong> boots, offered in a whole size range, connect to fin-blade modules in different performance parameters, specifications and styles. </p>
<p><strong>abs</strong> technology eliminates common foot-pockets, traditional diving boots and heel straps. Divers now can connect any boot size to any fin-blade module. We eliminated all material not contributing to thrust to minimize drag and applied sole integrated ski-binding technology to optimize the transfer of blade forces to our new boot.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525461401/csjyybycjlcp9oedlwhu.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Similar to cross-country or alpine ski-bindings, the <strong>abs</strong> integral blade/binding units interlock with the <strong>abs</strong> boots and form an inseparable unit- until you release the blades with the flip of a lever.  The abs binding clips are a part of the blade-module and will not come off unintentionally.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525469775/gowbipslv3z1q0p0csni.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>abs</strong> integral binding clips are a combination of materials typically used in the production of ski bindings- also produced by a leading ski-binding component manufacturer in Austria. They are designed to guarantee very high functionality and safety, are assembled by hand to ensure maximum quality, are resistant to UV and Saltwater and guarantee high fatigue resistance.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525302953/f2dyavklntcvf9ezwff5.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Modular fin-blades with patented, integrated <strong>Y-frame technology</strong> feature <strong>the world’s first standardized contact point for a fin-blade to a technical boot.</strong> This enables integral attachment of all present and future fin-blades to all available boot sizes. All fin-blade components are manufactured using top of the line injection molding machines from ENGEL and BATTENFELD. Our fin blades are made of virtually indestructible thermoplastic polyurethanes in various shore hardnesses to provide perfect dynamic performance.</p>
<p><strong>CARBON-BLADE MODULE:</strong> Very responsive and powerful blade bridging the gap from advanced snorkeling to free diving and spearfishing. Provides carbon material and free diving performance at a very competitive price point.</p>
<p><strong>WARP-BLADE MODULE:</strong> Latest version of our patented <strong>warp</strong> technology, first introduced with the original aquabionic1 fin. Perfect for SCUBA and advanced snorkelling. Featuring forced adaptive dynamic cupping and spreading, <strong>warp</strong> technology amplifies a diver’s kick impulse by aligning and accelerating water into mono-directional thrust. This innovative technology allows the fin to be precise and maneuverable at low thrust and increasingly powerful and responsive when more propulsion is needed.</p>
<div><p><strong>HYBRID-BLADE MODULE:</strong> Perfect entry level fin-blade for all activities. Combines the ease and comfort of a typical paddle blade with the thrust of our patented <strong>warp</strong> technology. </p></div>

<p>Funding goes in its entirety to the generation of final tooling and into fine-tuning of components. We are in the final stages of our R&amp;D/design process and already own tooling for several components of the abs system. Preparing gradation for our range of abs boots based on the MondoPoint sizing system is the next step in the development process- before the creation of molds for all required boot sizes.</p>

During the last 6 years of distributing our aquabionic1 fins- we learned that regardless of how progressive or efficient in design, with the standard model of fins the underlaying problems in fit, handling and performance persist.
By introducing the aquabionic abs system we proved that there is better technology than the outdated solution of using foot-pockets. 
Our protected slogan ‘ technically barefoot’ paraphrases our aspiration to create the perfect balance between physical requirements, ultimate user friendliness and design.


Due to the elimination of all material not contributing to thrust, the abs system weighs up to 35% less than the average open heel fin. This increases efficiency due to the reduction of accelerated mass on the up- and downstroke during finning. The system eliminates standard foot-pockets, diving booties and heel-straps while delivering unsurpassed comfort, performance and safety. 



The replacement of basic ‘foot-pockets’ with sophisticated technical footwear - the logical step in the evolution of diving fins. Our abs aquatic hybrid boots feature sole integrated technology that distributes blade forces homogenously into the “system diver”- without stressing or constraining the foot. Special boot uppers stabilize and cushion to provide a comfortable and secure fit, both on the ground and in the water.
 


Ergonomically and functionally advanced abs boots, offered in a whole size range, connect to fin-blade modules in different performance parameters, specifications and styles. 
abs technology eliminates common foot-pockets, traditional diving boots and heel straps. Divers now can connect any boot size to any fin-blade module. We eliminated all material not contributing to thrust to minimize drag and applied sole integrated ski-binding technology to optimize the transfer of blade forces to our new boot.
 

Similar to cross-country or alpine ski-bindings, the abs integral blade/binding units interlock with the abs boots and form an inseparable unit- until you release the blades with the flip of a lever.  The abs binding clips are a part of the blade-module and will not come off unintentionally.

abs integral binding clips are a combination of materials typically used in the production of ski bindings- also produced by a leading ski-binding component manufacturer in Austria. They are designed to guarantee very high functionality and safety, are assembled by hand to ensure maximum quality, are resistant to UV and Saltwater and guarantee high fatigue resistance.

Modular fin-blades with patented, integrated Y-frame technology feature the world’s first standardized contact point for a fin-blade to a technical boot. This enables integral attachment of all present and future fin-blades to all available boot sizes. All fin-blade components are manufactured using top of the line injection molding machines from ENGEL and BATTENFELD. Our fin blades are made of virtually indestructible thermoplastic polyurethanes in various shore hardnesses to provide perfect dynamic performance.
CARBON-BLADE MODULE: Very responsive and powerful blade bridging the gap from advanced snorkeling to free diving and spearfishing. Provides carbon material and free diving performance at a very competitive price point.
WARP-BLADE MODULE: Latest version of our patented warp technology, first introduced with the original aquabionic1 fin. Perfect for SCUBA and advanced snorkelling. Featuring forced adaptive dynamic cupping and spreading, warp technology amplifies a diver’s kick impulse by aligning and accelerating water into mono-directional thrust. This innovative technology allows the fin to be precise and maneuverable at low thrust and increasingly powerful and responsive when more propulsion is needed.
HYBRID-BLADE MODULE: Perfect entry level fin-blade for all activities. Combines the ease and comfort of a typical paddle blade with the thrust of our patented warp technology. 

 

abs thermal neoprene socks provide warmth and foot protection or can be worn with slightly oversized boots for an additional layer in cold diving conditions. Choose the long version when diving with a wetsuit. Liners are made from 2/3/5/6 nylon 2 neoprene with a multi-panel design allowing for an anatomical shape. A non-slip screen print on the sole provides better grip on slippery surfaces. The socks seams are glued and blind stitched for strength and comfort. Available in multiple sizes.
 

Funding goes in its entirety to the generation of final tooling and into fine-tuning of components. We are in the final stages of our R&D/design process and already own tooling for several components of the abs system. Preparing gradation for our range of abs boots based on the MondoPoint sizing system is the next step in the development process- before the creation of molds for all required boot sizes.
A heartfelt thank you to everyone who is helping to bring the abs system to life! 
By supporting us you are bringing innovation into the water sports industry to reinvent equipment that has been largely unchanged for over 90 years.

<h3><strong>Help Troop 303 Replace Stolen Gear</strong></h3>
<p><strong><br/></strong>Hi folks.  My name is Phil and I'm a 42 year old local Tampa small business owner and father of an 8 year old scout and 5 year old soon-to-be-scout.  I know how hard these guys work to raise funds for the gear they use all year.  When it is stolen in the blink of an eye, it is disheartening.</p>
<p>Rest assured that all funds raised will be given to the scouts to replace the gear that was stolen.  </p>
<p>For the full story about what happened, read the article on TBO.com:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www2.tbo.com/news/news/2012/jul/08/1/lakewood-ranch-scout-troop-victimized-by-thieves-ar-426674/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www2.tbo.com/news/news/2012/jul/08/1/lakewood-ranch-scout-troop-victimized-by-thieves-ar-426674/</a></p>
<p>Im hoping the community steps up to the plate with a donation.  Let's show these scouts who give so much of their time to the community that bumps along the road are common and with a little help, any problem can be overcome.</p>
<p><br/>I know that times are tough and our area has been hit particularly hard.  Anything you can give will be greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>Scouts are taught to make best use of what little they have so any contribution, large or small, will help these kids out.</p>
<p>Thanks for your support!</p>

Hi folks.  My name is Phil and I'm a 42 year old local Tampa small business owner and father of an 8 year old scout and 5 year old soon-to-be-scout.  I know how hard these guys work to raise funds for the gear they use all year.  When it is stolen in the blink of an eye, it is disheartening.
Rest assured that all funds raised will be given to the scouts to replace the gear that was stolen.  
For the full story about what happened, read the article on TBO.com:
http://www2.tbo.com/news/news/2012/jul/08/1/lakewood-ranch-scout-troop-victimized-by-thieves-ar-426674/
Im hoping the community steps up to the plate with a donation.  Let's show these scouts who give so much of their time to the community that bumps along the road are common and with a little help, any problem can be overcome.
I know that times are tough and our area has been hit particularly hard.  Anything you can give will be greatly appreciated. 
Scouts are taught to make best use of what little they have so any contribution, large or small, will help these kids out.
Thanks for your support!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p style="""">Capt Bannerman, of the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment, is due to lead his men ashore as part of the massive assault by the Allies on the Normandy beaches. Three days before D-Day, not knowing exactly what lies ahead, he pens a letter which becomes part of a journal, outlining his emotions to his wife Elizabeth: “From now onwards until D-Day plus One, I shall not get any letters from you… This morning this made me feel quite desperate… I felt a little empty. I am waiting so impatiently for news from you of yourself and my small sons, more than ever before in my life I am longing for you and if I am not able to send any letters at least I can write what I have to say in this little book and so express my emotions.”</p>
<p style="""">Bill Price joined the Territorial Army in 1938 at the White City London. Serving with the Royal Engineers at the start of the war, he was transfered to the Royal Navy as part of the Channel crossing in convoy on the 5,000 tonne merchant ship Innerton one of the first pontoons to be holed and sunk on D-Day+1. This was one for the first ships sunk to form the floating Mulberry Harbour breakwater of Arromanches-les-Bains for the following invasion of Operation Overlord the D-Day landing. Bill served as anti-aircraft artillery and known as being known as 'Trigger'.</p>

'Trigger' Bill served on a sunken ship forming the breakwater Mulberry harbour at Gold Beach at D-Day. He manned the anti aircraft artillery on board the ship Innerton.

At this point

We are working towards the securing our cabin, as it is a popular time for families returning to the UK from Australia. We offer personal photo postcards, and regular video updates, with exciting memories for us both.
We need another £500 towards this, as we have already started fundraising. The trip is in March 2015  with P&O on the Aurora.

Bill was known as 'Trigger' has he was considered by his artillery mates in the Army as being fast on the 'trigger'!. He still moves around at a cracking pace today.  
We will send friends updates
We will send postcards, video emails updates he loves listening to the song 'we are sailing'! Bill is truly amazing, is a great story teller, and loves meeting people and travelling. We will tell you about the people we meet and the ports of call, with lots of private pics and tweets.
Sydney to Southampton dates and ports of call
Everyone can contribute 
Everyone can contribute or ask questions, and read about his adventures. This would start prior to our departure from Sydney! For my part, Helen loves taking photos and videos and will create the fun clips of us on the journey.
Prior to departure readings and updates
Prior to our departure in the month of January you will start receiving poetry readings from WWII and 'letters from D-Day' personal letters written home, and tributes to D-Day Piper Bill Millin.
For example this poem by Second World War poet John Jarmain, read by WW2 veteran Capt Robert Day.       http://youtu.be/Qu8uAJ_7VQg
ebook 'If I Don't Come Home'
These readings are a tribute to the lives and loves of people separated by war. We were also inspired by the ebook written by Capt Alastair Bannerman 'If I Don't Come Home' D-Day Letters from WWII.
Capt Alastair Bannerman................ Bill Price 1938 TA
Capt Bannerman, of the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment, is due to lead his men ashore as part of the massive assault by the Allies on the Normandy beaches. Three days before D-Day, not knowing exactly what lies ahead, he pens a letter which becomes part of a journal, outlining his emotions to his wife Elizabeth: “From now onwards until D-Day plus One, I shall not get any letters from you… This morning this made me feel quite desperate… I felt a little empty. I am waiting so impatiently for news from you of yourself and my small sons, more than ever before in my life I am longing for you and if I am not able to send any letters at least I can write what I have to say in this little book and so express my emotions.”
Bill Price joined the Territorial Army in 1938 at the White City London. Serving with the Royal Engineers at the start of the war, he was transfered to the Royal Navy as part of the Channel crossing in convoy on the 5,000 tonne merchant ship Innerton one of the first pontoons to be holed and sunk on D-Day+1. This was one for the first ships sunk to form the floating Mulberry Harbour breakwater of Arromanches-les-Bains for the following invasion of Operation Overlord the D-Day landing. Bill served as anti-aircraft artillery and known as being known as 'Trigger'.
Tributes to D-Day Piper Bill Millin
Also series of youtube tributes to the D-Day piper Bill Millin. William ""Bill"" Millin (14 July 1922 – 17 August 2010), commonly known as Piper Bill, was personal piper to Simon Fraser, 15th Lord Lovat, commander of 1 Special Service Brigade at D-Day. Bill featured as the piper in the Normandy landing film 'The Longest Day'.
Bill Millin Tribute
We were in Piper Bill Millin's home town Dawlish, this year. It is a seaside town whose railway runs along the ocean front, and was recently devestated by the powerful winter storms. We stayed on the seafront William ""Bill"" Price recalled happy memories of cycling from London to Dawlish in 1933 with three friends and staying at the old coast guard houses under the railway line. We also visted the wonderful local museum which features Bill's life in Dawlish. In June 2014 we visited Sword Beach in Normandy and paid tribute to the  remembrance  statue. YouTube: http://youtu.be/B4WZwz2C72M

After our successful Kickstarter campaign for the TREXAD Air Pack, we immediately set out to tackle our next project. Our goal was to create an awesome travel pack that everyone would love. We couldn’t think of a better way to do it than to ask our backers and supporters for their advice.The features kept rolling in. They all sounded so great that we decided, “instead of prioritizing, let’s include EVERYTHING.”And that’s exactly what we did.We’re back this time with a feature-rich travel pack created totally by the crowd. You asked for it, we included it. Meet TREXAD Mundo.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello and welcome to our funding page for the Ignite to Light USA Mission Road Trip. We are a group of young people currently studying the methods Christ used to teach including the health principles and to meet the needs of humanity.</p>
<p>Although we are from all over the world our mission is united and simple. We aim to take the light of medical missionary work to a starving US population--a land that eats for entertainment but is dying of preventable diseases.</p>
<p>We will ignite a revival for a closer connection to the ""light of the world,"" Jesus Christ. Through interactive workshops and demonstrations we will show the practicality of the gospel and how the tool of health can be used to initiate the spread of the word of Christ's love to dying American communities.</p>
<p>There are needs all over the world, but our hearts--and bodies--are in the USA. We trust that you see the necessity of supporting us in this work.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our funding goal is $15,000. This will purchase a used van, one large enough to hold us five plus luggage, food, books, etc and late model enough to make it to the West coast and back. Our other expenses include:</p>
<p>-Purchasing education materials- class handouts, manuals, books, demonstration supplies, etc</p>
<p>-Purchasing gas along the trip which will be around $1200 in total.</p>
<p>-Purchasing a camera to use to document our expericences on the trip</p>
<p>-Paying for KOA's and camping/lodging expenses</p>
<p>-Paying for food</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are prepared to give small tokens as gratitude to our donors for their generosity. These tokens will be anything from a postcard from the various states, to a DVD set of health presentations, to healthy option cookbooks, to a Skype interview with the Ignite To Light team, to a 25% discount for a relaxing and educational 11-day Lifestyle Session here at the Wildwood campus!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the event that we don't reach our goal the donations will not go to waste. They will be used instead to travel to as many states as the funds allow. All hope will not be lost the mission trip will move forward!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are partnering with a ministry called LIGHT. LIGHT trains lay men and women to be medical evangelists, like Christ, and then to teach what they have learned with the end goal of spreading God's love to all mankind. LIGHT has done training in far reaching places of the world, bringing light to many dark parts of the globe. However, little has been done right here at home.</p>
<p>By your contributions we will be able to travel, educate and ignite a flame of enthusiasm for further training. This project is one of the first of its kind and is a pioneering endeavor. With God's guiding, our vision, and energy and your contributions this dream will soon become a reality for the Ignite To Light team and many waiting Americans.</p>

</p><p><b><i>WHAT IS THE APOLLO BEACH NYE FIREWORKS SHOW?</i></b></p>
<p>Again this New Year's Eve, the Apollo Beach/South Shore
business community is coming together to put on it’s second annual 2015 New
Year's Eve fireworks show. Thanks to the shows corporate sponsors last year, we
raised just shy of $30,000, which officially made this show the largest 2014
New Year's Eve fireworks display in the entire State of Florida! </p><p>FACT: Last
years Apollo Beach/South Shore NYE show actually beat out the City of Ft. Myers
for the state's largest NYE fireworks display and was 3X the size of the
Channelside/Tampa NYE show at the port. This event put the sleepy little town
of Apollo Beach prominently on the regional stage and garnered a tremendous
amount of media coverage. We have already raised more corporate money this year
than we did last year, which means the 2015 show is going to be BIGGER &amp;
BETTER than before!</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1052790/files/20141127233604-Tribune.JPG?1417160164"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1052791/files/20141127233635-TBT.JPG?1417160195"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b><i>WHY DO WE DO THE FIREWORKS SHOW?</i></b></p>
<p>The Apollo Beach New Year's Eve fireworks show was created
as a way for local business owners to give back to the community of Apollo
Beach – which is the same community that these businesses are located in, and
the same community which these businesses are supported by. This show was
originally thought of as a ‘thank-you’ to the community from the sponsors who
funded it. Last year, we never imagined in a million years that we would ever
get the kind of support from the business community that we ended up receiving.
Furthermore, we never expected that the ‘thanks’ would get turned around back
onto us, but that’s exactly what happened. Here’s an example of one of the
countless emails and messages that poured in after last years show: </p><p style=""""></p><ul><li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Patty
Lemanski wrote, <i>""The fireworks show last night was breathtaking. Thank you
so much for allowing my family and this community to be a part of this New
Year's celebration. When I looked over at my 12 year old standing there on the
dock, and saw tears running down her face, I asked her if she was all right.
She said that this was something she would remember for the rest of her life,
it was so beautiful."" </i></span><br/>
</li></ul><p style="""">So, this is why we do the fireworks show, and that’s
what it is all about. </p>
<p><br/></p><p><b><i>WHY ARE WE TEAMING UP WITH INDIEGOGO?</i></b></p>
<p>After the success of last years show, we had a lot of
interest expressed from individuals and smaller businesses who wanted to help
participate in sponsoring the next show, but weren't in a position to give the minimum required $500 corporate donation. Additionally, there were a lot of
homeowner’s associations who wanted to participate collectively but couldn’t because of
their association by-laws. Therefore, by partnering with Indiegogo, we have
created a way for those of you who want to participate in this
community-sponsored event to do so. The minimum donation through this site is just $1, so you can pick a donation level that works for you.</p>
<p><br/></p><p><b><i>WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR?</i></b></p>
<p>Anything! No dollar amount is too small. <i>EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR
DONATED WILL GO DIRECTLY TOWARDS ADDITIONAL FIREWORKS TO MAKE THIS SHOW BIGGER AND
BETTER. NOT A SINGLE PENNY WILL BE USED FOR MANAGEMENT FEES, PROCESSING FEES,
SALARIES, ADMINISTRATIVE FEES, OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. </i></p>
<p>We are also looking for you to spread the word for
us. So, regardless of whether or not you choose to participate in helping us
sponsor this year’s show; please plan on coming to the Apollo Beach
area to see it. It’s free of charge to everyone, and it’s going to be
absolutely spectacular. We promise you’ll be glad that you came. </p>
<p><br/></p><p><b><i>WHAT TIME AND WHERE IS THE SHOW?</i></b></p>
<p>The show, which will be choreographed to music, will begin
promptly at 12:00am midnight on January 1<sup>st</sup> (New Year's Eve). The fireworks will be shot off of a construction barge floating in the center of Bal Harbor,
right off of beautiful Tampa Bay, in the middle of Apollo Beach. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1052400/files/20141127180730-2015_Fireworks_Map.JPG?1417140450"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The spectacle will
be visible to all of the 5,800 homes and businesses in the area,
including those people not located directly on the water, and will be seen

<br/></div>","WHAT IS THE APOLLO BEACH NYE FIREWORKS SHOW?
Again this New Year's Eve, the Apollo Beach/South Shore
business community is coming together to put on it’s second annual 2015 New
Year's Eve fireworks show. Thanks to the shows corporate sponsors last year, we
raised just shy of $30,000, which officially made this show the largest 2014
New Year's Eve fireworks display in the entire State of Florida! FACT: Last
years Apollo Beach/South Shore NYE show actually beat out the City of Ft. Myers
for the state's largest NYE fireworks display and was 3X the size of the
Channelside/Tampa NYE show at the port. This event put the sleepy little town
of Apollo Beach prominently on the regional stage and garnered a tremendous
amount of media coverage. We have already raised more corporate money this year
than we did last year, which means the 2015 show is going to be BIGGER &
BETTER than before!
WHY DO WE DO THE FIREWORKS SHOW?
The Apollo Beach New Year's Eve fireworks show was created
as a way for local business owners to give back to the community of Apollo
Beach – which is the same community that these businesses are located in, and
the same community which these businesses are supported by. This show was
originally thought of as a ‘thank-you’ to the community from the sponsors who
funded it. Last year, we never imagined in a million years that we would ever
get the kind of support from the business community that we ended up receiving.
Furthermore, we never expected that the ‘thanks’ would get turned around back
onto us, but that’s exactly what happened. Here’s an example of one of the
countless emails and messages that poured in after last years show: 
Patty
Lemanski wrote, ""The fireworks show last night was breathtaking. Thank you
so much for allowing my family and this community to be a part of this New
Year's celebration. When I looked over at my 12 year old standing there on the
dock, and saw tears running down her face, I asked her if she was all right.
She said that this was something she would remember for the rest of her life,
it was so beautiful."" 
So, this is why we do the fireworks show, and that’s
what it is all about. 
WHY ARE WE TEAMING UP WITH INDIEGOGO?
After the success of last years show, we had a lot of
interest expressed from individuals and smaller businesses who wanted to help
participate in sponsoring the next show, but weren't in a position to give the minimum required $500 corporate donation. Additionally, there were a lot of
homeowner’s associations who wanted to participate collectively but couldn’t because of
their association by-laws. Therefore, by partnering with Indiegogo, we have
created a way for those of you who want to participate in this
community-sponsored event to do so. The minimum donation through this site is just $1, so you can pick a donation level that works for you.
WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR?
Anything! No dollar amount is too small. EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR
DONATED WILL GO DIRECTLY TOWARDS ADDITIONAL FIREWORKS TO MAKE THIS SHOW BIGGER AND
BETTER. NOT A SINGLE PENNY WILL BE USED FOR MANAGEMENT FEES, PROCESSING FEES,
SALARIES, ADMINISTRATIVE FEES, OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. 
We are also looking for you to spread the word for
us. So, regardless of whether or not you choose to participate in helping us
sponsor this year’s show; please plan on coming to the Apollo Beach
area to see it. It’s free of charge to everyone, and it’s going to be
absolutely spectacular. We promise you’ll be glad that you came. 
WHAT TIME AND WHERE IS THE SHOW?
The show, which will be choreographed to music, will begin
promptly at 12:00am midnight on January 1st (New Year's Eve). The fireworks will be shot off of a construction barge floating in the center of Bal Harbor,
right off of beautiful Tampa Bay, in the middle of Apollo Beach. The spectacle will
be visible to all of the 5,800 homes and businesses in the area,
including those people not located directly on the water, and will be seen
clear back to I-75, into Sun City, up to Riverview, and beyond. If you didn’t
have the pleasure of seeing it last year, watch the full video here on
Indiegogo, or ask anyone of the thousands of people who did. The best place to
view the show are properties close to Bal Harbor - on the water - in Apollo Beach.
There are several un-built, vacant properties, on Apollo Beach Boulevard that
make for perfect viewing sites. Last year, there were house parties everywhere in the community – so a friend’s house in the area is also a perfect
venue. Another great way to watch the show is from a boat. However, please be
aware that the Marine Patrol and Coast Guard will be shutting Bal Harbor off from boat access (in and out) approximately 2 hours before the show and for 30
minutes after. Also, Circles Waterfront Restaurant (www.circleswaterfront.com) hosts a large-scale outdoor party from 6pm to 2am that is free. 
WHO ACTUALLY DOES THE SHOW?
New Year's Eve is right around the corner, and all the
behind the scenes planning & permitting for the 2015 Apollo Beach/South
Shore NYE fireworks show is well under way. Pyrotecnico, Inc. (www.pyrotecnico.com), is hands down

</div></div>","MultiGrip is a new revolutionary multi-tool from the team that brought you the game-changing Disc Wallet products.
 
With pocket space at a premium, it’s important to get the most out of your multi-tool. Ideally, you want something that’s functional enough to be worth carrying, while still being easy to pocket and use.
 
The MultiGrip multitool embodies many core principles of Every Day Carry — utility, versatility, portability and weighs a mere 32g (1.1 ounces).
 
For quick fixes, tinkering, and other handy work, having a toolbox’s worth of functionality in a single pocketable tool is invaluable.
 
Portable and adventure-ready, the MultiGrip is ideal for the everyday carry community.
 

 

 
MultiGrip is made of durable and premium SUS 304 Stainless Steel featuring over 25 tool functions with each one of them providing precision-engineered multiple uses. 
 
304 stainless steel has excellent resistance to a wide range of atmospheric environments and many corrosive media. CNC machining is being applied, and the surface is bead blasted for a smooth finish. This method was selected to ensure that MultiGrip could withstand a lifetime of use.
 
MultiGrip was born after a long 1 year of designing, prototyping, and testing in different conditions by our fans worldwide. These iterations have been perfected to provide the features as follows.
 

 
The most widely used multi-tool feature, the bottle opener can open all types of caps in a second. Blending tradition with modern, the large grip area provides optimum comfort and makes it extremely easy to use.
 

 

 
MultiGrip features a new patent pending screwdriver tip that will fit a #2/3 Slotted, #2 Square Drive, #2/3 Phillips, and #2/3 Combinations (Phillips/Slotted or Phillips/Square) screw all in one bit. 
 
With so many combinations in one body, the MultiGrip caters all types of screw types. 
 

 

 

 

 
MultiGrip features a new patent pending closed wrench where it has combined both Metric and Imperial sizes into one. 
 
All of the dimensions are designed proportionally to keep it strong and at a minimum weight for adequate torque on hex nuts and bolts.
 
The Imperial side fits 5/16, 3/8, 7/16 and 1/2 inch hex sizes. 
 
The Metric side fits M8 (13mm), M7 (11mm), M6 (10mm) and M5 (8mm) hex sizes.
 

 

 

 

 
MultiGrip features a standard 1/4"" inch hex drive pocket that will fit any desired bit. 
 
Whether you need allen head through to torx, the MultiGrip holds any standard 1/4” hex drive with the perfect fit and rotation to ensure it moves with you. 
 

 

 

 
MultiGrip allows you to open cans of paint of multiple sizes with ease. 
 
The angled edge of the tip is designed to properly fit under the lid lip to pry the can open. 
 

 

 
MultiGrip allows you to open boxes of multiple sizes and materials with ease.
 

 

 
MultiGrip allows you to access and remove batteries with ease.
 

 

 
MultiGrip allows you to open cans of multiple sizes and materials with ease. 
 

 

 
MultiGrip is equipped with a handy beveled inner edge that provides a sharp wedge that will strip many various sizes of wires. 
 

 

 
MultiGrip is equipped with a scoring tip that functions as a staple pry. Push-style mechanism lifts staples easily without tearing paper.  
 

 

 
MultiGrip is equipped with a scoring tip that tears open packages with ease. 
 

 

 
MultiGrip has a linear edge file with small beveled edges that can be used to file and smooth all surfaces including wood, metal, plastic and many more. 
 

 

 
MultiGrip is equipped with a letter opener that slides through all envelopes easily.
 

 

 
MultiGrip allows you to easily split pills with minimum effort.
 

 

 
MultiGrip features a serrated edge to cut multiple materials including rope, thread, fishing line, lace and many more. The serrated edge is TSA compliant and we have carried the MultiGrip in all commercial and international flights with ease.
 

 

 

 
MultiGrip is equipped with a scraper to remove even the toughest materials. Rugged Construction ensures superior wear tolerance and life.
 

 

 
MultiGrip allows you to scratch your tickets instantly without losing your fingernails.
 

 

 
MultiGrip's tape slitter tab makes opening tapes fast and easy.
 

 

 
MultiGrip features a handy 2 cm / 20mm / 0.78 inches ruler which is versatile for marking screws, bolts, and paperwork.
 

 

 
MultiGrip features a keyring holder to easily carry it anywhere on the go.
 

 

 
MultiGrip features a 3.2/3.3mm (0.127 inches) standard open spoke wrench that easily fits in between bike wheel spokes to tighten or loosen the spokes. Complimenting features include handy screwdriver bit and multi wrenches.
 
Be always prepared for your biking adventures.

Under CNC Machining, machine tools function through numerical control. 
 
A computer program is customized for an object and the machines are programmed with CNC machining language (called G-code) that essentially controls all features like feed rate, coordination, location, and speeds. 
 
With CNC machining, the computer can control exact positioning and velocity. 
 

 
MultiGrip is a complex multitool, that is lightweight and requires precise machining and we are excited to manufacture it for you. 
 

 


 
After various iterations, these are the final designs for the packaging.

Looking through the lens, we’re able to appreciate the minute changes between light and shadow, between different hues in the color palette... Then, with one small press of the shutter, capture the beauty and proof of our authentic lives. We on the PackChair team are passionate about both travel and photography. It’s how we get through the Monday to Friday grind. But we’ve come to realize with experience, and as we’ve collected more and more specialized equipment, that life throws at us a lot of unexpected obstacles on our way to the photography site. Carrying one or more heavy bags of expensive equipment runs its risks. One heavy rain, one fall, or one thief could indeed cost us thousands of dollars, but more importantly, it ruins the whole experience. We shared this issue with others and found that many of our friends and colleagues face the same issue, that is, protecting their heavy valuable equipment while at the same time enjoying their outdoor experience. Over several years and countless trials, we’ve created a solution: PackChair X.</p><p> </p><p>　In 2015, we launched PackChair, a backpack for short trips that also functions as a chair. After our first launch and getting feedback, in 2016 we launched a highly protective camera bag. Then, in 2017, we started thinking about what kind of bag could both protect our equipment and adapt itself to different types of outdoor journeys. Finally, we’ve arrived at PackChairX, a backpack that has the important qualities of our prior models, but also includes three more accessories to enhance a user’s varied needs. The ‘X’ in PackChairX stands for extra experience.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h2>Meet the Bivymok</h2><p>We have developed a beautiful and simple single pole two-person tent to be used on the ground as a stand alone unit or with our unique suspension platform as a hammock tent.</p><h3>Tent Up Front</h3><p>On the ground the tent can be quickly staked and lifted with a single aluminum pole. It has a wide zippered entry at the front. The main attraction of this tent is its ability to submerge its occupants completely in nature by providing an unobstructed view of everything around you while keeping the bugs out. And if it looks like rain, the waterproofed rain fly can be easily added to maintain a dry hideaway.</p><h3>Hammock in the Back</h3><p>The tent is designed to attach to our suspension platform to give you the best of both worlds, all the shelter you need with all the advantages of sleeping in comfort, midair. Our hammock platform can easily hold 1000 lbs, which really means, it's not delicate. There is no need to fear getting in or out. Our unique design also does away with falling through, falling off or being tossed out! </p><h3>Advantages</h3><p>It's easy to see how a suspended tent is the next evolution in sleeping outdoors, from those that are looking to add more terrain opportunities to their campsite to those that are just starting out. A Bivymok eases camp setup and nighttime anxiety. You'll think less about the ground and more about adventure.</p><p>Pockets are giving way to loops! Our looped ends in our suspension platform are where the versatility starts to show. With the many loops you have the flexibility to add what you want to your sleep fortress. You can hang your gear from them, use them to make micro positioning adjustments to your setup, attach them to other hangers to create super hammocks or gather them together for modified hangs. Loops are where it's at!</p><h2>Features</h2><p>We have a list of features underscored by quality. Our tent fabric is made of lightweight yet durable ripstop polyester. Both the bathtub floor of the tent and the entire rainfly have received a waterproof coating and have been taped at the seams to provide the tightest waterproof barrier between you and the elements. Our soft polyester mesh top is designed to keep the bugs completely out while you lay down and take in every view under the sky. It's a single aluminum pole tent which provides a quick setup. Aluminum stakes are provided for ground set up and straps and buckles help secure the tent to the platform for suspended camping.</p><p>Our suspension platform is where safety comes first. Every stitch becomes part of the overall design and versatility of the structure.

Whether you're on the beach, deep in the mountains or at the park, there is nothing better than hovering above the earth a bit as you soak it all in. There is also nothing worse than falling out of the sky. Removing the 'risk' from the whole hammock experience was one of the main goals. That was way back in 2016.</p><p>Aside from the safety benefit, the original Multimok solved other issues, too! The design removed all the complications of hanging a hammock 'just right' for the 'perfect lay'. It provided various set up options for a flat lay and works for back, side or stomach sleepers.</p><p>We did that by creating a modular suspension platform ready to hold 1000lbs of whatever you want to put into it. Our platform is designed around comfort and safety.</p><p>By adding modularity to our system it becomes whatever you want it to.</p><h2>Camp Multimok</h2><p>From our first KickStarter there are Multimok'rs all around the globe.</p><h2>Shipping</h2><p>We are shipping to the US for this campaign so that we can provide the best possible shipping price and faster service. There are shipping options for other countries on our website at <a href=""https://gear.multimok.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://gear.multimok.com</a></p><h2>FAQ</h2><p><strong>*When will it ship?</strong><br/>Now! We are currently shipping the Bivymok as of 8/3/2018. When funds clear with Indiegogo, it will be immediately shipped. </p><p><strong>*Do you ship outside the US?</strong><br/>Yes. Please go to <a href=""https://gear.multimok.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://gear.multimok.com</a> for your order. The additional shipping charges will be a calculated there.</p><p><strong>*Can I use my Bivymok tent in the air without the suspension platform?</strong><br/>No! The tent by itself is not designed to hold any weight and should not be suspended by itself.</p><p><strong>*Will my underside get cold?</strong><br/>No, not by design if you use the right sleeping gear for the right temps. Unlike a common hammock there is little or no compression on your underside. Your bag does not fully compress underneath you. The natural loft of the bag pushes through the grid of the suspension platform providing the warmth you would expect from the bag you are in.</p><p><strong>*Can I use a sleeping pad? Will it slip?</strong><br/>Yes! Sleeping pads are great whenever you can use them. By design, the grid will keep your pad in place if you slip the pad between the suspension platform and the tent. Always put your pad right on the skeleton for best results.</p><p><strong>*Where can I find more setup information?</strong><br/>Look at our YouTube channel ""multimok videos"" for more setup information and HOWTOs.</p><p><strong>*Can I use my Bivymok like an original Multimok?</strong><br/>Yes! If you want to use it just the same, just exclude the pole in the set up and sleep right on top of the rainfly. Ahhh!</p><p><strong>*Does my Bivymok require four (4) support trees/poles/posts?</strong><br/>While the Bivymok shines on four trees it can just as easily be used on 3 trees. With mods it can be used on two trees. We have even seen people use it with one tree!</p><p><strong>*Will the tent/fly fit on my previously purchased Multimok?</strong><br/>Yes! Our system is designed to be completely modular and interchangeable. All the dimensions of the skeleton have stayed the same.</p><p><strong>*Is there a stand for those of us who tend to camp in deserts where there aren’t any trees for support?</strong><br/>We've designed the Bivymok to easily go to the ground where there are no trees! A stand is on our upcoming development board!</p><p><strong>*I’m a bigger person.  How much weight can it hold?</strong><br/>1000 pounds (or a piano or a small horse)</p><p><strong>*Really?</strong><br/>Yep!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533301292/jdosr8we5ckx9hhjsc4z.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>*I’m still a bigger person.

It has a wide zippered entry at the front. The main attraction of this tent is its ability to submerge its occupants completely in nature by providing an unobstructed view of everything around you while keeping the bugs out. And if it looks like rain, the waterproofed rain fly can be easily added to maintain a dry hideaway.Hammock in the BackThe tent is designed to attach to our suspension platform to give you the best of both worlds, all the shelter you need with all the advantages of sleeping in comfort, midair. Our hammock platform can easily hold 1000 lbs, which really means, it's not delicate. There is no need to fear getting in or out. Our unique design also does away with falling through, falling off or being tossed out! AdvantagesIt's easy to see how a suspended tent is the next evolution in sleeping outdoors, from those that are looking to add more terrain opportunities to their campsite to those that are just starting out. A Bivymok eases camp setup and nighttime anxiety. You'll think less about the ground and more about adventure.Pockets are giving way to loops! Our looped ends in our suspension platform are where the versatility starts to show. With the many loops you have the flexibility to add what you want to your sleep fortress. You can hang your gear from them, use them to make micro positioning adjustments to your setup, attach them to other hangers to create super hammocks or gather them together for modified hangs. Loops are where it's at!FeaturesWe have a list of features underscored by quality. Our tent fabric is made of lightweight yet durable ripstop polyester. Both the bathtub floor of the tent and the entire rainfly have received a waterproof coating and have been taped at the seams to provide the tightest waterproof barrier between you and the elements. Our soft polyester mesh top is designed to keep the bugs completely out while you lay down and take in every view under the sky. It's a single aluminum pole tent which provides a quick setup. Aluminum stakes are provided for ground set up and straps and buckles help secure the tent to the platform for suspended camping.Our suspension platform is where safety comes first. Every stitch becomes part of the overall design and versatility of the structure. The many bar-tacks provide function and redundant strength and the circular multi-directional stitching holds it all together reducing stress points. User Satisfaction""Toughest, most versatile hammock on the market!""

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>GYBC has managed to send over 300 balls to Ghana, Haiti, Nicaragua, Panama, and Guatamala, but we still have over 250 soccer balls in our inventory that need to be cleared out by the end of the summer. Our goal is to send 3-5 large shipments to impoverished communities internationally who share a great love for soccer. </p>
<p>We want to include at least 50 soccer balls per shipment, along with shirts, jerseys, cleats and any other equipment we can fit into each package. This summer we want to go all out. One community at a time, we will provide everything they need to pursue their dreams. This innitiative will impact thousands of eager children who right now have little to no means to work towards a goal and pursue what they love.</p>
<p>Help us spread the beautiful game of soccer to everyone who deserves to play.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>GYBC has been in full swing for nearly 8 months and the reward could not have been greater. After sending over 300 balls to 6 developing countries, we have seen the amazing, positive change one ball can make. Perhaps the most dramatic and rewarding project GYBC embarked on that exemplifies this was our project to Port-au-Prince, Haiti.</p>
<p>Port-au-Prince fell victim to the disasterous earthquake in 2010, leaving many children orphaned, homeless, and feeling hopeless. Now 3 years later, the area and surrounding communities have slowly started to rebuild. When we  made a connection with 2 Haitian brothers (one living in Canada, the other in Haiti) we jumped on the opportunity to help this community.</p>
<p>We sent 32 soccer balls and 13 jerseys to our contact in Haiti for him to distribute to the community. The impact was both heartening and sobering. When the word got out that a package of soccer balls was to be distributed throughout the community, children came from far and wide to hopefully receive one. </p>
<p>Sadly, many children left with nothing. Although balls were given to large groups of children to share, there was not enough for every group, and many left to trek back to their distant community empty handed.</p>
<p>This photo shows the crowd that gathered outside his door:</p>

<p>These are the local teams that gathered at their soccer pitch to receive a ball (1 ball per team):</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc1/425339_10151447479902322_118894974_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span>This is where we began to feel disheartened. Our contact wrote ""</span>This boy came from a very far area but he’s not accompanied by his team. He didn't receive a ball and he is crying. But, he finally left very happy because he received a jersey.""</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/7054_10151447479582322_1181604155_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We understand that there are children globally that do not get the support they deserve, but this particular child was so close to getting support from GYBC. For us, he gives a face to the millions of children worldwide that we are striving to help. The funds we raise this summer will first and foremost be used to give back to this community in Haiti. The high demand in this community, combined with their overwhelming love of soccer, makes it the perfect distribution location. Moreover, a second shipment exemplifies our efforts to beat the odds and help everyone we possibly can, including all the children that narrowly missed out on a ball from our past project.</p>

Our goal is to send 3-5 large shipments to impoverished communities internationally who share a great love for soccer. 
We want to include at least 50 soccer balls per shipment, along with shirts, jerseys, cleats and any other equipment we can fit into each package. This summer we want to go all out. One community at a time, we will provide everything they need to pursue their dreams. This innitiative will impact thousands of eager children who right now have little to no means to work towards a goal and pursue what they love.
Help us spread the beautiful game of soccer to everyone who deserves to play.


The Impact
GYBC has been in full swing for nearly 8 months and the reward could not have been greater. After sending over 300 balls to 6 developing countries, we have seen the amazing, positive change one ball can make. Perhaps the most dramatic and rewarding project GYBC embarked on that exemplifies this was our project to Port-au-Prince, Haiti.
Port-au-Prince fell victim to the disasterous earthquake in 2010, leaving many children orphaned, homeless, and feeling hopeless. Now 3 years later, the area and surrounding communities have slowly started to rebuild. When we  made a connection with 2 Haitian brothers (one living in Canada, the other in Haiti) we jumped on the opportunity to help this community.
We sent 32 soccer balls and 13 jerseys to our contact in Haiti for him to distribute to the community. The impact was both heartening and sobering. When the word got out that a package of soccer balls was to be distributed throughout the community, children came from far and wide to hopefully receive one. 
Sadly, many children left with nothing. Although balls were given to large groups of children to share, there was not enough for every group, and many left to trek back to their distant community empty handed.
This photo shows the crowd that gathered outside his door:

These are the local teams that gathered at their soccer pitch to receive a ball (1 ball per team):

This is where we began to feel disheartened. Our contact wrote ""This boy came from a very far area but he’s not accompanied by his team. He didn't receive a ball and he is crying. But, he finally left very happy because he received a jersey.""

We understand that there are children globally that do not get the support they deserve, but this particular child was so close to getting support from GYBC. For us, he gives a face to the millions of children worldwide that we are striving to help. The funds we raise this summer will first and foremost be used to give back to this community in Haiti. The high demand in this community, combined with their overwhelming love of soccer, makes it the perfect distribution location. Moreover, a second shipment exemplifies our efforts to beat the odds and help everyone we possibly can, including all the children that narrowly missed out on a ball from our past project.

<p>Unfortunately, several obstacles got in the way of Dudd's vision becoming a reality. First, an anonymous ""international backer"" — <a href=""http://www.kentucky.com/2009/04/10/755970/developer-insists-centrepointe.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">who totally existed in real life as an actual person</a> — died, leaving the project short of funds needed to complete the hotel in time for the <a href=""http://www.nj.com/sports/njsports/index.ssf/2010/10/us_disappointed_in_showing_at.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">2010 World Sexquestrian Games</a>.

<p>Community members attempted to re-purpose the vacant lot as an <a href=""http://vimeo.com/4330585"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">outdoor recreation facility</a>. Dudd resisted these efforts and stayed true to his original vision, burning through <a href=""http://tomeblen.bloginky.com/2013/03/10/centrepointe-5-years-later-still-no-building-but-lots-of-impact/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">six different designs and a succession of architects</a> in the process. </p>
<p><b>Phase 2</b>, ""CentreLawne,"" commenced in 2010, saw the demolition site leveled, filled with dirt, covered with grass, and surrounded by fencing. The lawn remained a <a href=""http://copiousnotes.bloginky.com/2013/08/23/whats-so-bad-about-centrepasture/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">popular downtown attraction</a> for four years, but ultimately, Dudd decided he could no longer afford the time or the expense of ""keeping those damn kids off of my lawn."" It was time to move forward. </p>
<p><b>Phase 3</b>, ""CentrePitte,"" undertaken in the spring of 2014, employed tons of explosives to <a href=""http://youtu.be/QP94C4D31Xc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">blast a three-story-deep crater</a> into the ground, earning CentrePitte a bit of positive press as ""<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/centrepitte/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Biggest Hole in Kentucky</a>.""

<p><b>Phase 4</b><i>, </i>Lake CentrePointe, will be a radical re-envisioning of Webley Dudd's dream. Instead of a towering monolith, we propose a people-made oasis of calm in the middle of the city.

</div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><p>We owe much to Dudd and his original vision.

A pioneering ""urban landscape sculptor,"" Dudd specializes in large, permanent installations that challenge our assumptions about land use, public space, and urban development. After completing a series of retail galleries exploring the concept of ""vacancy,"" Dudd embarked on what he intended as his greatest masterpiece: CentrePointe, which was to be the largest, most expensive hotel Lexington had ever seen. 
The doubters had their questions: Why? How? Why? Critics lambasted the hotel's proposed ""giant cock-and-balls"" design —actually a cleverly disguised ""single finger salute,"" a tribute to the people of Lexington — which they described variously as ""ugly"" and ""monstrous"" and ""ugly.""



Always eager to court controversy, Dudd used notoriety for the project as fuel for its engine, driving forward ever harder, unflinching in the face of mounting criticism, making his vision appear inevitable and unstoppable. And so it was. The CentrePointe behemoth buffaloed its way to zoning approval and generous public support in the form of tax increment financing.  
Phase 1, ""The Big Bang,"" took place in 2008, with the demolition of a historic downtown block. The demolition eliminated or displaced several well-supported local businesses, including a popular music venue, a restaurant and bar, a ""billiards and beer"" joint, and a hat shop once owned by notorious independent filmmaker Terry Alan Grossman.
Unfortunately, several obstacles got in the way of Dudd's vision becoming a reality. First, an anonymous ""international backer"" — who totally existed in real life as an actual person — died, leaving the project short of funds needed to complete the hotel in time for the 2010 World Sexquestrian Games. But Dudd did not give up hope, even though it was apparent that nobody wanted the hotel, and that nobody could afford it. 
Community members attempted to re-purpose the vacant lot as an outdoor recreation facility. Dudd resisted these efforts and stayed true to his original vision, burning through six different designs and a succession of architects in the process. 
Phase 2, ""CentreLawne,"" commenced in 2010, saw the demolition site leveled, filled with dirt, covered with grass, and surrounded by fencing. The lawn remained a popular downtown attraction for four years, but ultimately, Dudd decided he could no longer afford the time or the expense of ""keeping those damn kids off of my lawn."" It was time to move forward. 
Phase 3, ""CentrePitte,"" undertaken in the spring of 2014, employed tons of explosives to blast a three-story-deep crater into the ground, earning CentrePitte a bit of positive press as ""The Biggest Hole in Kentucky."" While the pyrotechnics were impressive, they failed to persuade Kentucky lawmakers to hand over $30 million to finish the job.  
Phase 4, Lake CentrePointe, will be a radical re-envisioning of Webley Dudd's dream. Instead of a towering monolith, we propose a people-made oasis of calm in the middle of the city. Lake CentrePointe will provide opportunities for sailing, swimming, fishing — or doing nothing at all. 
What We Need & What You Get
We owe much to Dudd and his original vision. Ten years ago, a lake in the middle of downtown Lexington would have seemed ridiculous, even absurd, a sort of bad joke. Today, it seems like an attractive alternative.  The good news is that the excavation has been completed, and the hole has already begun to fill with water. This puts us way ahead, relatively speaking, especially if you don't count the past six years, and we don't. But we still have a long way to go. 
We need $30 million to finish this project. That's how much Webley Dudd asked the state for, and, frankly, we think our plan is more realistic than his ever was. 
Funds will go toward acquiring the property, paying for a site survey and preliminary elevation plan drawings, obtaining zoning approval, hiring an architect to oversee execution of the final design, work crews, insurance, landscaping, tree-planting, construction of a marina with boat slips and fishing piers, stocking the lake with various species of fish, and purchasing a sailboat.  Backers will get valuable rewards in the form of free boat rentals, family swimming passes, honorary naming rights, and lots of other stuff.   If we do not reach our funding goal, any money collected will go toward paying off my student loan debt and buying a new laptop computer. (Note: A total of $42 was raised during this campaign from three contributors. Each of those contributions was refunded in April 2015.)    The Impact 
Lake CentrePointe will take an empty, unused city block and turn it into a gorgeous, thriving, outdoor recreation facility that is family-oriented and open to the public.  Rather than a blight on our downtown landscape and an embarrassment to Lexington (why give Louisville any more ammunition?!), Lake CentrePointe will be an attraction that will bring people to Lexington from all over, to marvel at its beauty. It's good for the economy! [This point needs development/support. –Ed.]
 
  Risks & Challenges
Obviously, any venture of this magnitude — especially one in such a conspicuous location, where public and private interests become enmeshed and entangled — carries with it certain risks and challenges. After performing due diligence involving a rigorous economic analysis, multiple scenario studies, public opinion polling, multidimensional mathematical modeling, and other impressive-sounding stuff, we have arrived at the following conclusions:  
There is absolutely nothing that can possibly go wrong with this project. If anything does go wrong, we are 100 percent certain that it was not our fault.

<p>Hi, we are Carlos, Elieth and Fadrique, we have a small tour agency, that we have built over the years, offering personalized treatment to our clients, but now the big hotel chains and tour agencies hog all the clients making it difficult to survive as a business.

<p>The construction process is halfway through the mark, having invested $12 000 of our own pocket. We still need a bit more to finish it and making the final touches, if we don't accomplish the $25 000 goal, it will slow us down but we will push forward to make it happen, we don't have any doubt about that.</p>
<h3>Landscape &amp; weather</h3>
<p>Monteverde is one of the main Costa Rica's tourist destinations, a must in any tourist itinerary of anyone visiting Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It possesses a great biodiversity of flora and fauna. The weather is affected by the Caribbean wind, it tends to rain more heavily between September and October, and the dry season is between April and May.</p>

No awkward balancing or mess. Plus, there are countless other uses for the Adventure Mat, from showering and laying out gear to preparing meals and playing games.Enjoying the outdoors just got that much more enjoyable. THE ADVENTURE MAT IS GREAT FOR: Camping • Hiking • Skiing • Snowboarding • Cycling • Mountain Biking • Trail Running • Triathlons • Rock Climbing • Surfing • Paddleboarding • Boating • Fishing • Hunting • Snowshoeing • Golf • Baseball • Soccer • Motorcycle Touring • Travel • Families • Dog-owners • Picnics • Concerts • Outdoor activities of all kinds! Simple one-handed fold. The bottom side never touches the top. When I set out to the design the Adventure Mat, I had three main goals in mind: Make it simple, compact, and clean. I wanted a mat that could be used on dirt, wet ground or snow and then be easily packed away, ready for another use without having to clean it.After working through many design iterations, I finally arrived at the patent pending ‘magical’ folding design to achieve the following:

Always Clean on Top: Dirty bottom side never touches the top.

Simple: Only one hand needed to fold and unfold.

Compact: Folds down to a 6.5” x 6.5” square.

Packable: Stores easily in  waterproof pouch.
 Unfold and fold your Adventure Mat using just this hand-hold. Quickly go from a 3 sq ft surface to a compact 6.5""x6.5"" square. Easy to fold up with just one hand. The top side magically stays clean! Use your Adventure Mat year-round for changing outdoors, a doormat for your tent, a place to organize gear and much more. It provides a clean, comfortable surface that grips well on dirt, mud, snow, public shower floors and pretty much anywhere else you can imagine taking it. Use it again and again. Made from durable materials, easy-to-clean and quick-drying, the Adventure Mat is built to last! Why the Extra Flap?

It illuminates constantly as a book light for reading indoors while keeping you warm, or intermittently as a flashlight to increase your visibility in the darkness for safety purposes while camping or cycling.  The LED light is ergonomically designed on the blanket with particular angle and size to cast soft, shadowless light without directly flashing into your eyes, yet suffices to see clearly while reading.    Having clear advantages over traditional heated blankets that use built-in heating panels that are bulky, inflexible and uncomfortable to the feel, V-Blanket uses state-of-the-art carbon fiber weaved in with other fibers to create an ultra-fine and flexible texture, delivering the coziest and most comfortable warmth you can ever imagine.    The powerful V-Blanket heating system includes 5 inherent heating zones. Heat is instantly turned on via a press on the control button and evenly distributed leaving no areas that never heat up.   The temperature of different heating zones is controlled by different buttons. HOW TO USE:Plug-In – Connect the power bank to the plug, which is installed in the pocket. Turn On – Press and hold button control for 3 seconds and the button will flash red. Temperature Adjustment– Press the button again to modify heating levels.V-Blanket reaches 30°C (85°F) in just 30 seconds, providing instant warmth in any weather conditions.    Control the temperature settings on V-Blanket with the touch of a button and choose from high, medium or low heat depending on how cold it is outside. The button changes in brightness to indicate the heating level after being pressed:   The interior of V-Blanket is made with a soft, thick, warm cotton twill that has great heat retention and provides excellent warmth and comfort. The exterior is made with 100% waterproof nylon that is aimed to give you extra protection from wind, water, and the elements.    Unlike traditional heated blankets, which are notorious for bulky components and tangling cords, V-Blanket works at a non-hazardous 5V low voltage that it can be powered by any type of USB external battery pack. It also has a built-in female USB-A connector to charge your mobile device while keeping you warm and cozy. It is ideal for outdoor sporting events, untethered use on the couch, or chilly airplane cabins.  V-Blanket is incredibly lightweight and packable. It measures 54.5” x 38.5” when laid flat and weighs just 1.5 lbs. It compresses into a stuffed pack that measures 14.8” x 7.9”. With V-Blanket, you are always prepared for unexpected weather on vacations and holidays.   V-Blanket is both machines and hands washable, so you can just throw it in the washer with no worries. It can also be spin-dried at a low temperature.   V-Blanket does not sacrifice style for utility. In addition to its superior heat functionality, it comes in three different colors that are all very fashionable and stylish.

We thank them for their support and their trust.It is now your turn to show they were right all along, and back this project.   EN /   Keep in mind that we have already answered the most common questions in the FAQ, but we remain available to answer your questions in the comment section.FR /   N'oubliez pas que nous avons déjà répondu aux questions les plus fréquentes dans la FAQ, mais que nous sommes également disponibles pour vous répondre dans les commentaires.DE /   Beachten Sie, dass wir bereits die häufigste Frage in den FAQ beantwortet haben, aber wir stehen Ihnen im Kommentarbereich für Ihre Fragen zur Verfügung.ES & IT /   We will try to do our best, but we might no be able to be as reactive as the other languages.  Risks & ChallengesIMPETRO Gear is a young company but we are confident that with your help, we will be able to live up to expectations for this product. Most of the challenges we faced were addressed during the product development phase. We put a lot of thought, time and money into our designs. Many prototypes and samples have been produced and tested for months. Several things have been improved step by step and we are proud to say: our design is now ready for production.The search for factories, skilled staff, as well as the language barrier with our suppliers and the time zone difference did not make our life easy. We have been sourcing, developing fabrics and hardware together with our suppliers and manufacturing partners intensively during the last 2 years. We know our manufacturing partner, have visited them a couple of times and manufactured final samples with them already.Given the high cost of materials, manufacturing and minimum order quantities from the factory, finding the funds for production is our biggest challenge.But each challenge remains an opportunity for us to acquire new knowledge and allows us to improve each of the entrepreneurial skills that the creation and development of a company requires. We face it with enthusiasm and see these challenges as the steps to take our business to the next level.We also want to inform you that customs and taxes are not included in the price. Depending on your home country you might have to fill out a customs declaration and pay customs fees and taxes before you get your reward. We can't cover any compensation claims that arise due to your personal effort while handling these issues. Thank you for your understanding.We will do our best to support you in every matter though, please contact us for any queries.Your IMPETRO Gear Team",60.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Behind the Scenes</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why do we need your support? </strong></p>
<p>Crowdfunding on Indiegogo is a great way to introduce Infinite to the masses. We’re not just selling a cooler – we’re creating a new way for you to experience outdoor life and to have you participate in the product development journey, from vision to testing to launch. And this is just the beginning. We can’t wait for you to join us!</p>
<p><strong>How did this idea come to fruition?</strong></p>
<p>Infinite was created with the mission of making high-quality, easy-to-use, multi-function coolers for everyone. We believe big things always come in one package – that’s why we created an all-in-one party box to help you solve the problem of grabbing too much extra stuff for outdoor parties.</p>
<p>In creating the Infinite Coolers we focused on 3 things: quality, versatility and convenience. We wanted to learn from the mistakes of other brands, so we partnered with our user community to create a cooler that is useful, easy-to-use and affordable. It has the features users want, in an elegant, simple design.</p>
<p><strong>Bringing the Infinite Cooler to life</strong></p>
<p>Our prototype was finalized in 2017, and we spent over 9 months testing and improving it. The trial production will start just after the crowdfunding campaign. We always believe that the real value of something can be judged only from practical experience or results and not from theory. The earlier we make our production into a trial process, the faster we can send all the coolers to our backers.</p>

<p><strong>Manufacturing capability</strong></p>
<p>Infinite’s capabilities are constantly growing to meet the continuously changing demands of the outdoor marketplace. We offer a truly broad range of services from traditional cooler manufacture to the latest outdoor all-in-one box, from concept to completion, including design, manufacture, and supply.</p>
<p>At Infinite, we’ve invested heavily in manufacturing capability that will enable us to offer a comprehensive range. Rotational molding offers design advantages over other molding processes. With proper design, parts assembled from several pieces can be molded as one part, eliminating high fabrication costs.</p>
<p><strong>Where are we now?</strong></p>
<p>Currently, there are 20 rotational molding units and 8 large-scale machines, which provides a monthly production capacity of 5,000 coolers.</p>
<p>From incoming material inspection, procedure control, to finished product inspection, Infinite has a well established, high-efficient production process and stringent quality control system to ensure high-quality productions and timely delivery.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">FAQ</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>PRODUCT</strong></p>
<p><strong>How can I get an Infinite Cooler? </strong></p>
<p>The only way to get one is through our Indiegogo page here! Earliest backers get 60% off from the future retail price $599.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the size is this cooler？</strong></p>
<p>This is a 61 quart cooler. This means you can put a whopping fifty five (55) 18.5oz/550ml bottles into it.</p>
<p><strong>How much does the cooler weigh when it's empty？</strong></p>
<p>The Infinite Cooler weighs 10.5kg/23lbs when empty.</p>
<p><strong>What are the speaker specifications?</strong></p>
<p>The Infinite Cooler has built-in Hi-Fi dual-powerful Bluetooth speakers:</p>
<p>Bluetooth: 4.0</p>
<p>Power: 20w</p>
<p>Duration: 12 Hours</p>
<p>Frequency Response: 90Hz-20KHz</p>
<p>Signal to noise ratio (SNR): ≥60dB</p>
<p><strong>How long does the cooler battery last?</strong></p>
<p>With all the functions running simultaneously, the battery may last for up to 4 hours.</p>
<p><strong>How can I charge this cooler？</strong></p>
<p>Infinite Cooler comes with a removable battery. Just remove the battery and place it in the included charger to juice up. </p>
<p><strong>Does this have a </strong><strong>built in</strong><strong> battery to use the blender?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. There is an independent 550w battery for the blender. This is a separate battery from the cooler so that you can power your outdoor life for days.</p>
<p><strong>Can I use this cooler in the places other than America?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the removable the battery for Infinite Cooler can be re-charged from a 110v or 220v outlet. Since we are using USB-B ports to charge, it is possible for customers all around the world to use it.</p>
<p><strong>Does the Infinite Cooler come in multiple colors?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Where would this ship from?</strong></p>
<p>Infinite has already got our logistics partners, and all the coolers would be shipped from local areas</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>There are always challenges and unforeseen obstacles that arise when trying to bring a product to life, especially when it comes to a cooler with so many innovative features.</p>
<p>We’ve actually completed all pre-manufacturing steps before starting this project, but still there are some risks that you might want to know:</p>
<p>1) Supply chain：A hazard for any company is that the supply of certain components or materials dries up. To mitigate this we manufacture in Shenzhen, the world’s hub for the electronics manufacturer, and we have backups lined up so that we aren’t reliant on any single component supplier.</p>
<p>2) Certification: The Hi-Fi dual Bluetooth speakers in the cooler must be certified before they can be mass manufactured which can take time. The risk of delays here is minimal as we already got several options that could solve this problem in no time.</p>
<p>3）Shipping：Global shipping and warehousing logistics are mind-boggling. Hence, we have a partner with over 10 years of warehouse management experience. We understand that weather, port congestion, and other uncontrollable factors are also on the table.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a warranty?</strong></p>
<p>Definitely! All Infinite Coolers come with a 1 year warranty against defects.</p>

Behind the Scenes
 
Why do we need your support? 
Crowdfunding on Indiegogo is a great way to introduce Infinite to the masses. We’re not just selling a cooler – we’re creating a new way for you to experience outdoor life and to have you participate in the product development journey, from vision to testing to launch. And this is just the beginning. We can’t wait for you to join us!
How did this idea come to fruition?
Infinite was created with the mission of making high-quality, easy-to-use, multi-function coolers for everyone. We believe big things always come in one package – that’s why we created an all-in-one party box to help you solve the problem of grabbing too much extra stuff for outdoor parties.
In creating the Infinite Coolers we focused on 3 things: quality, versatility and convenience. We wanted to learn from the mistakes of other brands, so we partnered with our user community to create a cooler that is useful, easy-to-use and affordable. It has the features users want, in an elegant, simple design.
Bringing the Infinite Cooler to life
Our prototype was finalized in 2017, and we spent over 9 months testing and improving it. The trial production will start just after the crowdfunding campaign. We always believe that the real value of something can be judged only from practical experience or results and not from theory. The earlier we make our production into a trial process, the faster we can send all the coolers to our backers.

Risks & Challenges
There are always challenges and unforeseen obstacles that arise when trying to bring a product to life, especially when it comes to a cooler with so many innovative features.
We’ve actually completed all pre-manufacturing steps before starting this project, but still there are some risks that you might want to know:
1) Supply chain：A hazard for any company is that the supply of certain components or materials dries up. To mitigate this we manufacture in Shenzhen, the world’s hub for the electronics manufacturer, and we have backups lined up so that we aren’t reliant on any single component supplier.
2) Certification: The Hi-Fi dual Bluetooth speakers in the cooler must be certified before they can be mass manufactured which can take time. The risk of delays here is minimal as we already got several options that could solve this problem in no time.
3）Shipping：Global shipping and warehousing logistics are mind-boggling. Hence, we have a partner with over 10 years of warehouse management experience. We understand that weather, port congestion, and other uncontrollable factors are also on the table.
Is there a warranty?
Definitely! All Infinite Coolers come with a 1 year warranty against defects.",37.0,3,"1 Campaign

By combining his experience from the French military and his passion for the outdoors, Nico has created the best value micro blade that EDC fans can dream of.As a longtime enthusiast in the pocket knife community, Nico spent a lot of time understanding what makes a design functional and timeless.Black Panther is designed with functionality in mind, making light work of the toughest tasks. From starting fires, cutting boxes and cords, to escaping from windows in an emergency, we’ve engineered every part of this micro blade to be versatile in all situations.Press & editorial inquiries, click here for more informationor contact us pr@smrtgadget.comWhat can this small knife be used for? We thought you'd never ask. Integrating Black Panther's built-in features with accessory options, the possibilities are endless. Here are just a few examples, and the list just goes on... 
Fire Starter A common misconception is striking a firesteel rod with the cutting side of the blade. Doing so damages your blade, and it's not necessary when we know you put in time and effort for blade maintenance. We've designed a notch on the back of the blade, specifically for striking firesteel rods. The notch fits most rods, and it allows you to start fires easily, without damaging the blade.    Bottle Opener Who doesn't like opening a bottle like a badass?
   Cutting & Carving The hawkbill blade design ""grabs"" onto whatever it's cutting. The result? You don't have to apply too much force, a little force goes a long way, and cuts smooth like a hot knife through butter.        Emergency Escape (with Glass Breaker)""The best camera is the one you have with you.""We hope you never have to be in an emergency situation like this, but it's important to have the necessary tool when things happen.    Stealth Carry (with Pocket Clip)Whether you're in the midst of urban jungle or out in the wild, Black Panther has you covered. You can use it to process wood, start a fire, break out of an emergency situation, open a beer bottle, or cut just about anything for daily tasks.We like things that are practical, and when they come in style? Even better.​​      Compact design for convenience Speaking of style, here's more -Stretch Goal #2 - Titanium GrayStretch Goal #2 - Titanium GrayStretch Goal #2 - Titanium Gray  Press & editorial inquiries, click here for more informationor contact us pr@smrtgadget.comWe've engineered Black Panther with useful features and durability, every part of the blade was designed with functionality in mind. 
Blade Length: 4 cm (1.6 inches)   
Closed Length: 6.6 cm (2.6 inches) 
Open Length: 10.6 cm (4.2 inches) 
Blade Thickness: 2.8 mm (0.11 inches)
Weight: 40 g (1.4 oz) (without packaging) 
Handle Material: TC4/Grade 5 Titanium 
Blade Material: Crucible S35VN Stainless Steel
Sleek design Precision is keyIt all started with an idea - to create the best micro blade possible. A design that is small enough to be attached to your keys, and still effective for everyday tasks when you need it. We went through 3 prototypes, adding functions and making improvements each step of the way, to present you with the best version of Black Panther. It took us months of iteration and hard work to get us where we are today.Research & Development We chose Crucible S35VN stainless steel despite its high cost, to ensure Black Panther can handle all kinds of tasks that you may throw at it.As Knife Informer states in Guide to the Best Knife Steel - “you would struggle to find any steel with better edge retention, toughness and stain resistance for the money.”S35VN steel is also the superior version of S30V steel, which ""was designed in the US and is typically used for the high-end premium pocket knives and expensive kitchen cutlery.” Unlike other knives with 440C or AUS8 steel, we wanted to use the best stainless steel we can afford to construct Black Panther. Don't need a knife? You can pledge $1 or other amounts to support us.You can also gear up your Black Panther with accessory options - Leather keyring for convenient carry. Glass breaker + pocket clip for emergency escape.  *Please note the glass breaker & pocket clip CANNOT be used with the leather keyring attached.We all love options, so once we reach the $20,000 goal, you can choose to receive your Black Panther in Titanium Gray (although we love the original Midnight Black just as much).Stretch Goal #2 - Titanium Gray With the $10,000 goal, you'll receive your Black Panther in a gift box with microfiber pouch.Stretch Goal #1 - Gift Box & Microfiber PouchWe put a lot of attention to details and focus on added value, because we want you to be as delighted as we are when we finished our final prototype.Versatile for all situationsTungsten Carbide Glass Breaker & Deep Carry Pocket Clip To receive an accessory option, simply add the following amount to your total pledge amount.

<p>HEAT-O is designed to be placed close to the body to gain a maximum heating performance with minimum energy loss. It’s a combination of two sets. Thanks to this, you can cover all crucial upper and lower body parts. You can place the heating pads directly where you want and you don’t need to change your outfit to suit the fitting. <strong>You can make as many variations as you wish.</strong></p>
<p>The heating pads are made of a very thin, flexible and resistant material. Your grip and sensitivity of your hands stay the same and they’re very comfortable when performing any manual work. The same attributes apply to the heating pads when worn in your shoes.</p>
<p>HEAT-O has been designed to ensure that there is no obstruction to the user. This installation is a combination of carbon fiber and high quality electric cables in silicone insulation with an additional cable housing.</p>
<p>To maximize the efficiency of the heating, the elements are made based on your gender, height and weight.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Waterproof.</strong> The heating pads and the whole installation is fully waterproof including battery, connector and controller IP68. </li>
<li>
<strong>Flexibility.</strong> Feel the freedom of keeping warm in cold temperatures: HEAT-O is made of two units (upper and lower), each one with 4 heating elements. The heated pads are made up of carbon fiber and are water isolated thanks to our design. Place them wherever you decide. </li>
<li>
<strong>Wardrobe Compatibility.</strong> Irrelevant of whether you are wearing a sweat suit or heavy gear, HEAT-O will ensure the ultimate comfort, and no particular outfit is required. It will perform according to your requirements, will fit to any kind of dress code, and will not obstruct you in any way. </li>
<li>
<strong>Light &amp; Warm.</strong> HEAT-O is light and non-invasive. You'll feel its effect when youre body warms up. Heating panels are breathable and they do not stop evaporation of your body.</li>

<p>The Battery is the centre of every HEAT-O related activity. It has been designed to work for <strong>up to 15 hours</strong>. A combination of special silicone and polyurethane, which make up the battery case, increases its protection from damage, and can bend and adjust to fit your body. </p>
<p>The DC connector, which connects the battery and heating pads, is waterproof. In the event of any mechanical damage to the installation and heating pads, the battery will switch off automatically to keep its use as safe as possible. </p>
<p><strong>Both batteries</strong> – small and large have control buttons on the case to set up the temperature level just in case you don’t want to use O-Remote or your smart device.</p>

</div></div>","HEAT-O is... a wearable modular heating system key to maintaining optimal body temperature in the cold environment.Over the last couple of decades, technology has been known to satisfy and increase our daily lives, but when it is cold everyone is affected in the same way. This is why we have been inspired to change this particular instance, this is why we have created HEAT-O.  How to use it?You place heating elements on your body under any kind of clothing. You configure and control eight heating elements. Plug in to the battery, and viola! 

 


Basic set of components: remote controller, charger, battery and heating pads.
 
 
Who is it for?

HEAT-O is for professionals, amateurs, and everyone in between. Specify the type of cold activity you are participating in and we will ensure that HEAT-O has a purpose for you. From daily use to professional use in sports, hobbies and work duties.
Thanks to the modularity you can also use HEAT-O for rehabilitation purposes (thermotherapy) and any disability.
 
 
Why it rocks?
HEAT-O is solving common problems encountered when using the standard electrically heated clothing, such as water resistance, safety and multitasking. The system does not interfere with movements, is fully waterproof, works and is safe in full water immersion.


 
 
For Divers
 
TEMPERATURE RANGEThe temperature range created by heating pads is from 15°C to 40°C (from 59°F to 104°F). There is also Auto mode for automatic temperature holding via build in thermostat inside main heating panel.
AUTO MODE FOR DIVINGWe are preparing a heating program for one hour diving. It starts on a low heating setting and rises proportionally to the diving time. 
ACCESSIBILITY IN ANY CONDITIONSController is equipped with spin a switch to work in underwater pressure. Legible Led indicator will show you on which setting you are even in a complete darkness.
WATER RESISTANTAll components are IP68 (all elements under the suit) except for a controller that is 100WR.
STANDARDSFor controller we are providing universal connectors to work with any type of drysuit inflation valve with integrated 12V connector.
SAFETYBattery interior components – electronic and cells – are fully covered in a flexible polyurethane so there are no air spaces.
IN CASE OF EMERGENCYBattery is smart, in case of any malfunctions in heating installation it shuts off the power automatically. 
 
 

HEAT-O is designed to be placed close to the body to gain a maximum heating performance with minimum energy loss. It’s a combination of two sets. Thanks to this, you can cover all crucial upper and lower body parts. You can place the heating pads directly where you want and you don’t need to change your outfit to suit the fitting. You can make as many variations as you wish.
The heating pads are made of a very thin, flexible and resistant material. Your grip and sensitivity of your hands stay the same and they’re very comfortable when performing any manual work. The same attributes apply to the heating pads when worn in your shoes.
HEAT-O has been designed to ensure that there is no obstruction to the user. This installation is a combination of carbon fiber and high quality electric cables in silicone insulation with an additional cable housing.
To maximize the efficiency of the heating, the elements are made based on your gender, height and weight.


Waterproof. The heating pads and the whole installation is fully waterproof including battery, connector and controller IP68. 

Flexibility. Feel the freedom of keeping warm in cold temperatures: HEAT-O is made of two units (upper and lower), each one with 4 heating elements. The heated pads are made up of carbon fiber and are water isolated thanks to our design. Place them wherever you decide. 

Wardrobe Compatibility. Irrelevant of whether you are wearing a sweat suit or heavy gear, HEAT-O will ensure the ultimate comfort, and no particular outfit is required. It will perform according to your requirements, will fit to any kind of dress code, and will not obstruct you in any way. 

Light & Warm. HEAT-O is light and non-invasive. You'll feel its effect when youre body warms up. Heating panels are breathable and they do not stop evaporation of your body.

 
 

 
 

The Battery is the centre of every HEAT-O related activity. It has been designed to work for up to 15 hours. A combination of special silicone and polyurethane, which make up the battery case, increases its protection from damage, and can bend and adjust to fit your body. 
The DC connector, which connects the battery and heating pads, is waterproof. In the event of any mechanical damage to the installation and heating pads, the battery will switch off automatically to keep its use as safe as possible. 
Both batteries – small and large have control buttons on the case to set up the temperature level just in case you don’t want to use O-Remote or your smart device.


Temperature range: from 15°C to 40°C (from 59°F to 104°F)

Operating hours: HEAT-O Core, HEAT-O Dive: up to 15 hours (auto mode); HEAT-O Lite small battery: up to 5 hours; O-Remote – up to 40 hours

Charging: The battery can be charged with your HEAT-O Charger, and every charger with DC socket or 12V in car charger

 
 

 
 

To set up the heating level we have designed a waterproof remote controller – the O-Remote which communicates with the battery via Bluetooth. We take its ergonomic quality as one of our utmost priorities.
 
 

O-Remote in action
 
Ergonomics. O-Remote controller has got a spin switch and a led display to set up the heating level. This is why you can operate your remote even with the thickest gloves and in the darkness.
Application. It is not a necessity to use the remote if you prefer to control your temperature by means of your smartphone or smartwatch. For this purpose, you will be able to download the free application for your mobile device.
 
 

 
 
 

The HEAT-O Charger can easily charge your O-Remote (inductive charging) and the battery (wire charging) at the same time. We’ve equipped the charger with 2 additional USB ports and an induction charging capability, so you can use it for your other devices, like your mobile phone, tablet or smart watch.

 
 
 

HEAT-O is available in four versions for different types of activity:
 
HEAT-O Core is a basic set designed for most users. For drysuit diving enthusiasts there is a diving set available – HEAT-O Dive. If you are a fan of open machines, ie.: motorcycles, quads, snowmobiles, there is a HEAT-O Drive set – to power the heating system directly from the vehicle battery or 12V lighter socket. For less demanding users, there is a HEAT-O Lite – fleece vest with six heating elements.

 

 

 

 
 
 

 
 
 

For each HEAT-O Core and HEAT-O Dive set you will receive additional elements: a led bag and scarf. 
 
Led Bag. The led bag is designed for carrying your set. In the centre there is a led installation and a 6.4 ft. (2 meters) power cord. After connecting the cable to the HEAT-O battery you will have a glowing lantern, which can also be used as a led torch or lamp.


The bag also includes a 6.4 ft. (2 meters) red led strip as extra lighting or an SOS signal. If four people have a HEAT-O red led strip, a red cross signal 13 ft. (4 meters) can be arranged. You can set up the brightness level directly from your remote controller, O-Remote. All less are IP65. 


 
 
Scarf. The Fleece Scarf has 6 pockets, into which you can insert the heating elements. You can use it as a scarf, mask or hat.

After two years of prototyping, developing and testing our HEAT-O device, we have come up with the ultimate shape and design. We wanted to ensure that the heating system works well in the toughest conditions and make sure it is user-friendly.

Moving from concept sketches towards 3D project.
 
All the elements of the HEAT-O device are our own design and creation. Along the way we encountered many challenges such as achieving:

Heating installation modularity (possibility to fit to every individual’s shape) 
Waterproof abilities for all elements 
 Battery life due to impulse output and receiving thermostat signal 
Battery flexibility
Resistance for mechanical damages
Remote controllers and apps

<h3>The Hi-Lifer Solution</h3>
<p>The concept for creating the Hi-Lifer was born out of the frustration we've all felt attempting to haphazardly transport our smallest, most-prized possessions without success. Before Hi-Lifer, transportation mediums usually took the form of baggies, pop-top pill bottles that never seem to stay closed, socks and anything else that made sense.  Utilizing these types of arbitrary carrying cases typically resulted spills, leaks, strong odors and, ultimately, discovery.  Hi-Lifer provides a solution for everyone who is ready to have a sensible option to carrying their most cherished items. </p>
</div><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454016837/yedt57c7vncd3s03iq50.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div><div>
<p></p>
<h3>Superior Design for Dry Pockets, Bags &amp; Purses</h3>
<p>Hi-Lifer's designers and engineers have created a product that is stylish yet functional, and easy-to-use. The classic double-O ring design allows users store smaller size products in the top compartment and larger items in the bottom compartment.  One big advantage of the Hi-Lifer is that it allows both wet and dry items to be transported in the same device  without mixing.  Finally, oils, waxes and dry herbs can be stored and transported together!</p>

<p>Simply remove the cap by pulling straight back to insert the smaller items or remove the bottom chamber by pulling down to insert your larger items.</p>

The Hi-Lifer Solution
The concept for creating the Hi-Lifer was born out of the frustration we've all felt attempting to haphazardly transport our smallest, most-prized possessions without success. Before Hi-Lifer, transportation mediums usually took the form of baggies, pop-top pill bottles that never seem to stay closed, socks and anything else that made sense.  Utilizing these types of arbitrary carrying cases typically resulted spills, leaks, strong odors and, ultimately, discovery.  Hi-Lifer provides a solution for everyone who is ready to have a sensible option to carrying their most cherished items. 


Superior Design for Dry Pockets, Bags & Purses
Hi-Lifer's designers and engineers have created a product that is stylish yet functional, and easy-to-use. The classic double-O ring design allows users store smaller size products in the top compartment and larger items in the bottom compartment.  One big advantage of the Hi-Lifer is that it allows both wet and dry items to be transported in the same device  without mixing.  Finally, oils, waxes and dry herbs can be stored and transported together!








A Case for Everything
These days it seems like
every product has its own standardized carrying case; so why doesn’t the one
which you most highly covet? Introducing Hi-Lifer, the dual-chamber, leak-proof and smell-proof, discreet storage and transport device that allows you to carry your smallest and most treasured items from A to B without mixing, leaving a scent, or leaking.


The 80's Inspiration  


We love the 80's so we let it inspire us when trying to build a retro case for an age old product set. If you notice a little bit of Zack Morris meets Silicon Valley coder, it is by design.




Storing Uses
You can store anything in the Hi-Lifer! 



The Hi-Lifer Features










Transport Anything


Hi-Lifer is the newest and most ideal way transport your tiniest possessions in a secure and discreet way.  Not only will you be able to carry your items anywhere without the worry of messy or embarrassing spills, but you will also be able to keep small items hidden in plain sight.  No matter what, your accessories, tools, dry herbs, oils and waxes will remain intact, and so will your privacy.









Simple to Use, Easy to Clean
The operation of the Hi-Lifer storage device is easy!
Simply remove the cap by pulling straight back to insert the smaller items or remove the bottom chamber by pulling down to insert your larger items.
Either way, your items are being stored in the only dual-chamber, leak-proof, and smell-proof device around.
The Hi-Lifer is also dishwasher safe!

Keep Your Stuff SafeWhen was the last time you grabbed someone's highlighter just to see what was inside? Probably never. That's because the success of Hi-Lifer depends upon users and observers alike to quickly assume it is a normal highlighter and therefore not hold their attention for long. This is the definition of hiding in plain sight! 

Not only that, but Hi-Lifer's double O-ring design ensures that your items are safe from mixing, spilling or smelling, no matter where you take them!







Available in Pink, Gray, Black and Yellow

Write Your Own Story:



You need to quickly leave the house but all of your stuff is
spread out; you pull a Hi-Lifer out of your pocket and…


You are headed out to a ball game and you need to bring your
stuff; you load up the Hi-Lifer in your bag and…


You are tired of smelling like a smokestack and you don’t
want to experience a spill in your nice purse again; you grab your Hi-lifer
and…


You use your Hi-Lifer “Because it’s not what they think it
is”.

 a product designer that loves gadgets an the outdoors I decided to take
 a stab at the EDC ( Every Day Carry) market by creating a unique item 
that embellishes some of the most important tools for survival. Our 
early ancestors were credited with hunting and gathering, making fire,

Over 1,000 sea turtles are killed every year from plastic bags. A million plastic bottles are bought around the world every minute and the number will jump another 20% by 2021. Maybe you think, “It’s just one fork,” but the number of plastic utensils wasted is around 40 billion per year in the United States alone. The plastic straw is one of those items that won’t get recycled even when you put it in the recycling. It’s too contaminated. It’s too small.  Frequently Asked Questions What is EssenPack? EssenPack is the solution to the age-old travel dilemma.

<p>AlleyCat's founders and contributors are addicted to travel.  We are driven to fill up our passports with stamps and journals with stories from unique experiences of different cultures, local food, small towns, and friends new and old.  We also believe in leaving a place better than we found it.  AlleyCat was developed to accomplish both!  </p>
<p>We look to you; fellow travelers and those with the thirst for travel for support in getting this project off the ground!</p>
<p> </p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt=""An app designed for any traveler"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://alleycatapp.com/indiegogo/indie2.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""AlleyCat Traveler""/></div>
<h1> </h1>
<h1>The product.</h1>
<p>This app is for the explorers, the wanderers, and the curious!  You know who you are.</p>
<p>We are compiling the most interesting history, pop culture, nightlife, and local experiences into one intuitive application.  Designed for travelers of all budgets, locals, and recent transplants, the app uses your current location to show you the best a city has to offer, how to interact with it, and how to combine multiple things you are interested in into your own custom walking tour.  </p>
<p>Unlike guide books, AlleyCat is never out of date which means you have the latest and most up to date information at your fingertips.</p>
<p><strong>Key features include: </strong>Locally sourced content (history and attractions), custom based walking tours, social media integration, public transit info for each attraction, taxi fare predictor, calendar of upcoming events, integrated filterable maps, attraction bookmarking, practical and safety information, and so much more.</p>
<p> </p>

<h1> </h1>
<h1>Make a positive and local impact.</h1>
<p>Once the app is released, part of our profits go right back into the cities we serve.  We want to leave a place better than we found it and we do so by donating 5% of each cities profit to a local charity in that city.  This means we can make a big impact and help to target specific local needs.</p>
<p>For San Francisco, our first release, we have chosen to target youth homelessness by partnering with <a href=""http://www.larkinstreetyouth.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Larkin Street Youth Services</a>, a local organization working tirelessly to get young people off the streets and give them the tools they need to pursue their dreams and get ahead.  AlleyCat will donate 5% of profits to Larkin Street Youth Services when the app is released.</p>

<h1> </h1>
<h1>The money we raise...</h1>
<p>The money we raise will allow us to complete the app's functionality, perform testing to work out any kinks, and take the required steps to get the app to our audience via the app store.  Any money that is left over will be spent preparing for our Android release and completing content for additional cities.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt=""An App Designed for any Traveler"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://alleycatapp.com/indiegogo/indie0.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""AlleyCat App - iOS, Android and WP""/></div>
<h1>How much will it cost?</h1>
<p>We expect the app to cost between $3 and $9 dollars.  We are currently knee deep in pricing strategy and are considering the following factors in our decision making process:  the rate of customer acquisition at different price points, pricing of similar (but less awesome) apps, and how we can best serve the charity component of AlleyCat.</p>
<h1>iPhone, Android and Windows Phone</h1>
<p>AlleyCat will be available first on the iPhone and next on the Android.  We anticipate the Android release to occur approximately 6 months after the iPhone release.  We have not yet begun developing this app for Windows Phone, but with your help we hope to get started!</p>

Make a positive and local impact.
Once the app is released, part of our profits go right back into the cities we serve.  We want to leave a place better than we found it and we do so by donating 5% of each cities profit to a local charity in that city.  This means we can make a big impact and help to target specific local needs.
For San Francisco, our first release, we have chosen to target youth homelessness by partnering with Larkin Street Youth Services, a local organization working tirelessly to get young people off the streets and give them the tools they need to pursue their dreams and get ahead.  AlleyCat will donate 5% of profits to Larkin Street Youth Services when the app is released.
 

 
The money we raise...
The money we raise will allow us to complete the app's functionality, perform testing to work out any kinks, and take the required steps to get the app to our audience via the app store.  Any money that is left over will be spent preparing for our Android release and completing content for additional cities.

How much will it cost?
We expect the app to cost between $3 and $9 dollars.  We are currently knee deep in pricing strategy and are considering the following factors in our decision making process:  the rate of customer acquisition at different price points, pricing of similar (but less awesome) apps, and how we can best serve the charity component of AlleyCat.
iPhone, Android and Windows Phone
AlleyCat will be available first on the iPhone and next on the Android.  We anticipate the Android release to occur approximately 6 months after the iPhone release.  We have not yet begun developing this app for Windows Phone, but with your help we hope to get started!
Thank you Indiegogo!
We appreciate you taking time to learn about what has been our passion since 2011! Contact us or check out our website should you have any questions!

Being travelers ourselves, both for business and fun, we encountered a couple of issues with the backpacks we used. While designing our product we wanted to address those issues and that’s how we got the idea of “all-in-one” backpack. And by “all-in-one” we didn’t mean packing it with a bunch of advanced technological features. We just wanted to make it super functional and we believe we succeeded. Of course, functionality means different things for people and here we present our idea of it. We are sure though that there are a lot of people out there who share our view on it and who would love their backpack to be:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Stylish</strong></li>
<li><strong>Comfortable </strong></li>
<li><strong>Organizational</strong></li>
<li><strong>Spacious</strong></li>
<li><strong>Lightweight </strong></li>
<li><strong>Durable </strong></li>
<li><strong>Water-resistant </strong></li>

Being travelers ourselves, both for business and fun, we encountered a couple of issues with the backpacks we used. While designing our product we wanted to address those issues and that’s how we got the idea of “all-in-one” backpack. And by “all-in-one” we didn’t mean packing it with a bunch of advanced technological features. We just wanted to make it super functional and we believe we succeeded. Of course, functionality means different things for people and here we present our idea of it. We are sure though that there are a lot of people out there who share our view on it and who would love their backpack to be:
Stylish
Comfortable 
Organizational
Spacious
Lightweight 
Durable 
Water-resistant 
  If you are one of them, look no further! Our backpack combines all of these and so much more. Let’s dive into the world of a simply cool backpack.  Sleek design and top-quality materials allow you to wear NEWEEX backpack and still be rocking that fancy suit or jacket of yours!Six contoured pads give extra support for your back, shoulders and neck and provide maximum ventilation - no more sweaty back! Over 20 cleverly-designed pockets and compartments will make you a master of organization!   Steady and durable materials allow the backpack to hold its shape, yet it’s still lightweight.   USB charging port will keep your battery always full!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hi, I am Shayne Wermers and I have been given the wonderful opportunity to travel to Kenya this winter break. This past year has been absolutely amazing in the way that God has been working in my life and others around me. The ministry that I've been working with over these past few years is Young Life where I am a leader. I get the privilege to spend time with and invest in these high school kids lives. It has been just amazing to watch these kids grow so much in their faith. I have always had the desire to travel over seas and experience the world, but I was never ready. God has placed it on my heart that this is something that I shall pursue and honor him. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact </h3>
<div>In Kenya we will be working primarily with orphans, the local church and doing some evangelism. This is a great chance to build friendships and love on others for who they are. Allowing the to show their culture and experience they way the live.  </div>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Created by a mom, especially for moms! And kids and dads too, of course — the Go Happy Travel Tray is great for everyone when on the go! It makes travel easier and way more fun!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509812073/sbpcbmpt3ylkdnx8fhro.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Nicole, a San Francisco based mom who loves to travel with her kids, decided to develop the Go Happy Travel Tray after years of picking up toys and food off yucky yucky airplane floors. Inspired by her passion for making life easier and more fun, her vision of a simple white tray that provides a clean, contained, creative space for her kids to play, color, and eat while traveling has come to life.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>We need funding — a surprising amount! It actually costs a lot to produce a beautifully designed, durable, functional, and kid safe travel tray.</p>
<p>We are excited to move forward and start manufacturing to meet our market launch date of June 2018. Getting these trays in your hands for summer travel is our goal!</p>
<p>$25,000 would be a great start to kick of the next stage of this journey!</p>
<p>All funds raised during this campaign will fund the tooling (building the molds to build the tray) and manufacturing process. We are lined up to begin tooling this December and expect to deliver pre-orders of the Go Happy Travel Tray by early June 2018.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How Far We Have Come</h3>
<p>We have worked hard to get the Go Happy Travel Tray to this stage. We have received great feedback from parents and kids who have used various prototypes on flights and in other environments. The tray really does make travel easier and more fun!</p>

<p><i>We flew from Oakland to Denver and played the whole way — the iPad never came out. We tested the ducktaped prototype version and it worked great! I intentionally brought toys I'd never take on a plane otherwise, and we had a blast! We played with a spinning top, Wiki Stix, crayons and markers, wind-up toys and a game with lots of small pieces. Nothing fell on the floor and my son honestly didn't realize it was time to land because he was so engaged in play. The tray works and I would absolutely use it again. We'd love to fly (and play!) with the final product.</i></p>

<h3>Design Process - Let's Take a Peek</h3>
<p>Working with Stellar Design to design the Go Happy Travel Tray was fun and challenging. We decided on the fixed border and removable elastic clip attachment system after months of brainstorming and testing lots of mock ups.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510024623/rqfdlhsv40bxwfx9ejay.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Brainstorming and testing folding hinge options presented much more of a challenge. After months of back and forth, Nicole and Stellar Design looked at mechanical engineering pros and cons for 2 very different paths. With the help of APROE, an awesome prototype team in San Francisco, they weighed many factors and made the decision keep things simple and drop the hinge feature. Nicole decided to make the tray slightly smaller so it could be stowed easily without folding, but still provide enough surface area for play and meal space.</p>

We are the Aweh Backpackers in Durban, South Africa. A small friendly business with the emphasis on a family-vibe. But sadly we have to move our Backpackers to a new location. This time we don´t want to rent. We want a place we can call ours, without the fear of losing it after a few years due to rental agreements.We are going to create a Backpackers with a friendly atmosphere and beautiful scenery.For the last year, hundreds of tourists made their own contribution towards Aweh Backpackers. In the form of artworks, as well as stories. We don’t want to lose it, as the memories and the people are the heart and soul of Aweh.It is our home. We need to find a way to keep Aweh alive. Our ProjectWe are looking at houses in the price range of $175 000 (South African property is amazingly cheap in comparison). In order to qualify for a bond, we have to put down $60 000 for our dream house in an even better location in town. This is our goal for this campaign.Whatever amount we raise will go as a down payment to a property. If we don´t reach our goal, we would look at options of selling equity to would-be investors.What we truly believe, is that the best gift we can give to anyone who is willing to help us, is an experience rather than material things.

Your Personal
On The Go Washing Machine 



 






 



 

  
    OmiSonic is going to revolutionize how we clean. It uses ultrasonic technology to deep clean at the microscopic level. This means it’ll push out dirt and clean parts, holes, and corners that could never before be washed by washing machine or hand-washing. As a result, you’ll get ultra-clean results while using only 2% the water of a washing machine!  Wireless also means safe! Ultrasonic washers need to be submerged in water to work properly, but most current ultrasonic washers are wired. It’s very dangerous to soak a wired electronic device in water - making these washers potentially hazardous. OmiSonic is completely wireless and IPX8 waterproof - meaning you can wash without worry or hazard!  UltraSonic Cleaning TechnologyOmiSonic uses ultrasonic cleaning technology to wash your items. The device generates ultrasonic waves that create thousands of microscopic bubbles in the water. These bubbles float to your item and implode, forming a vacuum that SUCKS out dirt, particles, and bacteria lodged in your clothing, fruits, jewelry, or items.Because the bubbles are microscopic in size, they have the ability to pull out particles that are deeply lodged in your item. The bubble can go into corners, cracks, and crevices previously unreachable, and the force of the vacuum is powerful enough to dislodge the particles stuck in there.  When you have thousands on thousands of these micro-cleaning bubbles floating all around your cleaning load, you’ll be sure to get the deepest clean EVER. It’s like having an army of microscopic cleaners go into the deepest corners of your laundry and flushing out every nanometer of debris and bacteria stuck in there.As a result, OmiSonic’s ultrasonic cleaning technology will wash your clothes, fruits, vegetables, and jewelry deeper, cleaner, and much more effectively than traditional washing methods. 
 
 True Wireless CleaningOmiSonic is battery powered. This means you don’t need an outlet to have it work!Take it with you to the remotest of areas and have ultrasonic cleaning ready at hand.  Whether you’re backpacking in the remote reaches of the country or polishing your silverware at home, OmiSonic will make sure you can clean your items quick, easy, and hassle-free.   Our app uses bluetooth to connect your phone with the device (no service required). We spent countless hours developing and refining it to be absolutely amazing.  Once finished with the calculations, it will suggest the best washing time, temperature, and amount of detergent needed for the wash - providing the best result every time! Simple Stains to Full LoadsOmiSonic is powerful in quality and quantity. You can wash up to 2kg (~4.4 lbs) per load effectively! A 2kg (~4.4lb) load will take around 120 minutes (one full charge) of wash time, whereas a 0.5kg (~1 lb) load will only take about 30 minutes (four loads from one charge). Wash Any MaterialNo matter if it’s cotton, polyester, wool, or silk - OmiSonic will get the dirt and stains out of your clothes with ZERO DAMAGE, ZERO SHRINKING, and ZERO COLOR BLEEDING. Wash all your clothing and items in peace! Remove Any StainWhether it’s mud, wine, soy sauce, oil or blood* - OmiSonic will remove it all!

Moran </b>(1958-2012), was a father, husband, lawyer &amp; an avid roller coaster enthusiast. At age 51, Kevin was diagnosed with early-onset <b>Alzheimer's Disease</b>. After a short three-year battle, he succumbed to complications from the disease and passed away at age 54 in 2012.</p><p>To honor his memory and to raise funds &amp; awareness for the ongoing fight against <b>Alzheimer's Disease</b>, in the spring &amp; summer of 2013, I set out to ride 100 roller coasters in 100 days, taking pledges from friends, relatives &amp; supporters per-ride and raised over $9,000 by the time of my <b>Walk to End Alzheimer's</b> event in October 2013. The nickname of my fundraising team is ""<b>Kevin's Koasters</b>.""<br/></p><p>Many of the smaller amusement parks ""comped"" my admission fees as I was riding &amp; raising money for charity. Unfortunately, the larger, more corporate amusements parks have very involved rules for their charitable contributions and very short windows to submit requests. I do not mind buying a season pass for Six Flags parks, as it is a very good deal if one plans to got to a park 3 times or more (which I did in 2013, and hope to do again this year).</p><h3>What We Need<br/>
</h3><p>I would very much like to repeat the success of last year's tour. <br/></p><p>As you might expect, traveling the Northeast on the 2013 tour took a personal financial toll on me with gas &amp; travel costs. While I was able to raise a ton of money for charity, I also put myself in a bit of a hole financially with travel, accommodation &amp; park admission costs. <br/></p><p>This Indiegogo campaign is <u>strictly</u> to help offset my travel &amp; accommodations costs as much as possible in 2014. I have already purchased my 2014 <b>Six Flags </b>season pass, but now I need to fund the travel costs needed to visit as many <b>Six Flags </b>parks as possible to reach my 100 coaster ride goal. The preliminary itinerary includes the following <b>Six Flags </b>parks (shown with approximate round-trip travel miles):</p><ul>
<li>Six Flags Great Adventure, Jackson, NJ (720 miles)<br/>
</li>
<li>Six Flags New England, Agawam, MA (630 miles)<br/>
</li>
<li>Six Flags Great Escape, Lake George, NY (490 miles)</li>
<li>Six Flags Great America, Gurnee, IL (1,300 miles)</li>
<li>Six Flags Le Ronde, Montreal, QC Canada (700 miles)</li>
<li>Six Flags America, Marlboro, MD (760 miles)</li>
</ul><p>Depending on funding received, other coaster crawls may be planned as well including Texas &amp; California!</p><p>Any funds raised above &amp; beyond the cost of travel &amp; accommodations will be donated to the cause, the <b>Alzheimer's Association </b>of the Rochester/Finger Lakes region.<br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What You'll Get<br/>
</h3><p>In addition to taking donations for riding rollercoasters, <b>Kevin's Koasters</b> also is fundraising by selling imported gourmet coffee, another one of Kevin's passions. <br/></p><p>To encourage &amp; reward you for helping to fund our tour, we will offer the following perks for donors at the following levels:</p><ul>
<li>
<b>$10</b> - One (1) purple <b>Alzheimer's Association </b>awareness silicone bracelet</li>
<li>
<b>$25</b> - One (1) 12 oz package of <b>Kevin's Koasters Coffee</b>, one (1) bracelet<br/>
</li>

<b>$50</b> - One (1) 12 oz package of <b>Kevin's Koasters Coffee</b>, one (1) tie-dye <b>Kevin's Koasters </b>logo t-shirt, one (1) bracelet</li>
</ul><h3>Q: Should I contribute to travel costs or donate to the cause?</h3><p></p><p><b>PLEASE NOTE: This is NOT a donation to the Alzheimer's Association or my Walk to End Alzheimer's fundraising.

Our model allows <strong>to see underwater and on the surface too</strong>. </p><p>Being able to see on the surface, and not only underwater, is a significant bonus... It makes the <strong>pre-dive preparation more relaxed</strong>, and the <strong>surface protocol much easier in competition</strong>.</p><p> Underwater, once you get used to it (it takes a few sessions, just like when you start to use a noseclip), being able to <strong>see perfectly</strong> makes you feel more serene, especially in case of problem such as your lanyard getting tangled. Finally, for your fun-dives, you'll be <strong>able to enjoy the beauty of the underwater world without having to worry about equalizing a mask</strong>.</p><p>The width of the googles can be tuned with the 4 different size nose bridge delivered with to fit your specific face ergonomic. </p><p>Producing the type of <strong>tailor-made goggle structure</strong> we have designed requires a large investment for the injection mold, but this is the <strong>only option to offer goggles with double vision (underwater and on the surface)</strong>, of <strong>optimal quality, </strong>with<strong> a perfect positioning of the lenses, unparalleled comfort</strong>, a<strong> killer design </strong>and still <strong>super affordable.</strong></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1596453723/hiqdkvqawzxdepiovpou.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>The amazing Eric Fattah designed the very first models around 20 years ago. Back then, lenses were included <strong>too </strong>inside the goggles. This was semi-handicraft work, produced only in small series, and therefore with a fairly expensive price tag of around 200-300 USD.</p><p>For the past few years, the various models found on the market were made using regular swimming goggles, in which two holes were made to house the lenses. However, this meant you could no longer see anything on the surface, since the lenses could not be fitted in the inner space of standard swimming goggles: that space is too small and the lenses would be too close to the eyeballs. Moreover, piercing holes inside swimming goggles takes time: such fluid goggles are produced in small quantities and remain expensive. </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1596453946/jy12xppl6gziolzvxar2.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><h3><i><strong>So… How can we keep such an affordable price?</strong></i></h3><p><i><strong>(compared to the fluid goggles already available on the market? )</strong></i></p><p><i><u>3 main points</u>: </i></p><p><i>- Instead of buying a pre-existing model of goggles and tampering with it so that it can host the lenses, we will be producing the goggle structure ourselves instead, using a super-strong polycarbonate. Once the big initial investment to produce the molds is done, then the production costs for this tailor-made goggle structure is fairly low, since we work directly with the producer.</i></p><p><i>- Regarding the top-quality lenses, in order to keep a competitive price, we ordered several thousand pieces from one of the best producers of lenses in the world.

Our model allows to see underwater and on the surface too. Being able to see on the surface, and not only underwater, is a significant bonus... It makes the pre-dive preparation more relaxed, and the surface protocol much easier in competition. Underwater, once you get used to it (it takes a few sessions, just like when you start to use a noseclip), being able to see perfectly makes you feel more serene, especially in case of problem such as your lanyard getting tangled. Finally, for your fun-dives, you'll be able to enjoy the beauty of the underwater world without having to worry about equalizing a mask.The width of the googles can be tuned with the 4 different size nose bridge delivered with to fit your specific face ergonomic. Producing the type of tailor-made goggle structure we have designed requires a large investment for the injection mold, but this is the only option to offer goggles with double vision (underwater and on the surface), of optimal quality, with a perfect positioning of the lenses, unparalleled comfort, a killer design and still super affordable.  The amazing Eric Fattah designed the very first models around 20 years ago. Back then, lenses were included too inside the goggles. This was semi-handicraft work, produced only in small series, and therefore with a fairly expensive price tag of around 200-300 USD.For the past few years, the various models found on the market were made using regular swimming goggles, in which two holes were made to house the lenses. However, this meant you could no longer see anything on the surface, since the lenses could not be fitted in the inner space of standard swimming goggles: that space is too small and the lenses would be too close to the eyeballs. Moreover, piercing holes inside swimming goggles takes time: such fluid goggles are produced in small quantities and remain expensive.    So… How can we keep such an affordable price?(compared to the fluid goggles already available on the market? )3 main points: - Instead of buying a pre-existing model of goggles and tampering with it so that it can host the lenses, we will be producing the goggle structure ourselves instead, using a super-strong polycarbonate. Once the big initial investment to produce the molds is done, then the production costs for this tailor-made goggle structure is fairly low, since we work directly with the producer.- Regarding the top-quality lenses, in order to keep a competitive price, we ordered several thousand pieces from one of the best producers of lenses in the world. This enabled us to considerably lower the price per unit. - Finally, we will be using a smart pin system, onto which lenses can be clipped. As they will remain inside the goggles, we do not need to handle the time-consuming and expensive process of piercing holes in the structure. Once the lenses are clipped into place, and unless you do a very specific maneuver, they are firmly fixed with no risk of losing them.     Components-Skirt and head-strap: top-quality silicon-Structure: polycarbonate -Lenses: top-quality 20mm planoconvex  Be the first to pre-order your new Octopus fluid goggles, at a great discounted price!!! Production will start in September 2020, and delivery is planned for late October 2020. Enough words, the video speaks for itself!!!A warm thank you for your support!Pascal.",3.0,0,"7 Campaigns

Many people don’t believe that is possible to achieve in a 3-length tenkara rod but we went for it anyway, and I feel like we have actually succeeded in that with the current prototype of the MUTANT Tenkara rod design.We have been working on this rod design for quite some time and finally made a lot of progress getting it the to performance level we wanted it to be late last year. After finishing our co-creation project of the MIZUCHI Tenkara Rod with Tom Davis (of Teton Tenkara) for tight fishing quarters last summer we learned many design elements that helped move the MUTANT rod prototype design progress to a whole new level of performance.(By the way, conversations with Tom Davis through out the years and reading through his blog posts has been very enlightening us and an influence in many in many things we do here at DRAGONtail. We thank him for always sharing his thoughts and experiences.)This last rod prototype our factory completed for us is more than we could have hoped for, we are very pleased. We are so excited to finally move forward from prototyping the MUTANT rod to now setting up production of the new rod and introducing it publicly.Our MIZUCHI Tenkara Rod has been very popular since it’s launch last September and people seem to be loving the rod for fishing tight quarters on small creeks and streams, like many of the creeks Tom Davis fishes. We are so happy to soon have the new MUTANT tenkara rod to cover the longer rod lengths for fishing more open casting areas (my kind of water) and still have a shorter length (10.3ft) to make casting in many tighter casting quarters easier. Really with the MIZUCHI rod and the new MUTANT rod together you can fish just about any water situation in a preferred length.We appreciate your contribution in helping us launch this excellent new tenkara rod, and we hope you enjoy the big discount you get for supporting us on this product launch.I really think a lot of tenkara anglers that prefer light level lines are going to love how this rod casts them with ease, although the rest of you are still going to like how smooth it casts most tapered lines as well.It blows me away how much I like the MUTANT rod in each of the 3 zoom lengths, more so than any other zoom rod I have tried; and I have tried many from USA brands to Japanese brands, we do a lot of rod research here at DRAGONtail. I think you will be very pleased with the MUTANT rod’s performance for you.Perks Available:Mutant Tenkara Rod reward: You get the Mutant zx380 Tenkara Rod with hard case and rod sock.Mutant Tenkara Rod w/Starter Kit reward: You get the Mutant zx380 Tenkara Rod with hard case, rod sock, spool of DRAGONtail Level Line (enough to make several different length lines), 2 line spools, 3 Tenkara flies, and a spool of tippet.We guarantee the delivery of all the perks, our reputation depends on it and we are an established company with great reputation we want to keep.Tenkara Addict Video Review of the Mutant Prototype How To Use a Multi-Length Zoom Tenkara Rod",10.0,2,"3 Campaigns

<p><b>Hammocks are the best. </b>We’ve never met one we didn’t enjoy relaxing in but they’re NOT perfect - here’s why:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good spots are hard to find - Trees too far apart or too small</li>
<li>Antisocial - Fits two people at most </li>
<li>Not Adaptable - Strung up or useless</li>
</ul>
<p>So we set out to re-imagine the hammock. Six months later and we’re proud to introduce to you the M.C. Hammie. It's a hammock, shelter, blanket all-in-one.</p>

We tell you this to let you know we are professionals... but still goobers.<br/><br/>We are motivated by family, friends, and nature, animals, coffee, and sweats. Our plan is to build an international community of Wildish outdoorsy folk who just get what we are doing and want to participate in the journey. Sounds simple enough, you in?<br/><br/>Thanks for stopping by,<br/>Rick and Adam</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>We’ve been in business long enough to know there are always risks. We're committed to getting this right, that's a promise. Here are a few risks and challenges that we've thought of:</p>
<p>Product Manufacturing Delays</p>
<p>• We've already done production runs of our Mr. Big Stuff blanket so we're confident in our manufacturers; however, factories can have unforeseen setbacks.<br/>• We stay in constant communication with our manufacturers from prototype to production to assure the highest quality end product.<br/>• We always work on-site with our manufacturer for new products to resolve any challenges quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>Shipping Delays</p>

</div></div>","Hammocks are the best. We’ve never met one we didn’t enjoy relaxing in but they’re NOT perfect - here’s why:

Good spots are hard to find - Trees too far apart or too small
Antisocial - Fits two people at most 
Not Adaptable - Strung up or useless

So we set out to re-imagine the hammock. Six months later and we’re proud to introduce to you the M.C. Hammie. It's a hammock, shelter, blanket all-in-one.

 

It’s the solution to a problem we call “All The Things”. We grew tired of bringing a small mountain of stuff with us on daily adventures, so we decided to do something about it.
The M.C. Hammie has already lightened our weekend carry and it feels goooood.
 
Unlike other hammocks, it's designed to be shared with friends. It'll keep all your besties off the dusty, wet ground one day...

 
then, out of the sun and drizzle the next...

 
and is always ready for hammock time...

 
perfect for just about anything...

 

 

The special sauce lies in the integrated straps and carabiners. With a shake it’s a blanket.... 

 
 with a pull it’s a hammock.... 

 
 and with a pop it’s a shelter....

 

Materials and Hardware:


The M.C. Hammie is made with the same high performance materials commonly found in premium tents and select hammocks. The primary material is a DWR Diamond Ripstop Nylon that is durable and water repellent. 
Beverage and water proofyness
 


Diamond Patterned Ripstop Nylon is durable, super soft, and packs down small. Equally useful at the beach or your backyard.
Stuffs easy and packs small
 


We've used eight premium aluminum carabiners throughout the design for their light, durable, and smooth clipping.
Adam testing the carabiners at Phil's Trail in Bend
 


Built to last, we've put triple and double stitching where it maters most.
Triple stitching and ballistic webbing straps
 


Most hammocks overlook the versatility gained from simple nylon loops. They have a big impact on multi-use-ability so we designed them in.
Sewn-in nylon loops bc its smart
 


The included Get Down aluminum ground stakes keep the M.C. Hammie in blanket mode, while the included cord can be used to fashion yourself a shade or rain shelter.
 

M.C. Hammie Includes:
1x Attached Ripstop Nylon Carry Pouch - aka: beer holder6x Get Down Aluminum Ground Stakes8x Aluminum Carabiners - aka: clip combos for daaaays12’ Paracord Line2x Freedom Tree Straps - aka: freebie ya'll! Only for backers ( $30 value)

 

 

  

 

 

We met on the Eastern slopes of the Gnar'yall range. Rick worked as a pigmy goat merchant, while Adam worked on his tan... just playing. We met at a co-working space in Bend.
We have started Wildish to mix things up a bit. Hopefully, alot. We are outdoorsy homies looking to make outdoorsy gear everyone can use. Not too extreme or spendy and definitely not under designed and boring. We think It’s time for more fun, smart stuff.
Adam Allen and Rick Lee
Did you know Rick has a background in engineering and Adam is a design expert? We both have helped build and manage major consumer product companies as 9-to-5ers for over a decade. We tell you this to let you know we are professionals... but still goobers.We are motivated by family, friends, and nature, animals, coffee, and sweats. Our plan is to build an international community of Wildish outdoorsy folk who just get what we are doing and want to participate in the journey. Sounds simple enough, you in?Thanks for stopping by,Rick and Adam


 
 
 

 
Risks and challenges
We’ve been in business long enough to know there are always risks. We're committed to getting this right, that's a promise. Here are a few risks and challenges that we've thought of:
Product Manufacturing Delays
• We've already done production runs of our Mr. Big Stuff blanket so we're confident in our manufacturers; however, factories can have unforeseen setbacks.• We stay in constant communication with our manufacturers from prototype to production to assure the highest quality end product.• We always work on-site with our manufacturer for new products to resolve any challenges quickly and efficiently.
Shipping Delays
• We are choosey about who we ship with and will try to find the quickest and most reliable delivery service for our backers.• We will do our best to ship to the earliest backers first and work our way back till y'all have one.
Lost Packages
• We’ve had some experience shipping products internationally, which means we know things can get lost.• We're selecting our shipment partners to minimize issues but if problems do arise we're committed to make sure your reward gets into your hands.

If you take care of your employees, they will care for the clients.""</i></p><p>Now, on a mountain side, going for the top, this is not just desirably, it is essential. </p><p>So we just told you about the conditions, what we need and how we intend to ensure the payments of fair salaries.</p><p>Below you can chek all about how we intend to use the money we hope to get, find more info about working conditions about perks and a lot more. But first we would like to tell you about the kind of company we are creating</p><h2>Introducing Stella Track</h2><p>In order to make the climb as a team the climbers will be introduced to the crew at the starting gate. They will be presented with the name and responsibility of each crew member, so the climber knows who is carrying what, who is making the food and so on. This will eliminate any shadow workers – a shadow worker is someone who is not there. The climbers could be told there are fifteen workers when in reality there is only ten, it means there are five shadow workers. With fewer workers there are fewer to share the salary and the tip. A little more payment, a lot more work - and an appearance to be kept.</p><p>Stella Track will be an open and transparent company where the crew will not have to pretend. The climbers will be able to approach any of the team members and walk freely around the camp while all the crew will be completely at ease, because there will be no inaccuracies to hide.</p><p>This was agreed upon in a meeting we had with porters and guides who we are going to work with.</p><p>We also talked about the possibility of eating together. This could be fixed with tourists having pasta, the crew ugali and then they would all have the same sauce – the problem was the mess tent. If everyone should  eat together the mess tent would have to be huge – and more porters would be needed to carry it.</p><p>Instead they suggested people would eat separately like now, and then the climbers could come over and have their tea with the crew outdoor. They would also be welcome to visit the crew area and take pictures of the food being made, for instance.</p><p>Again, this was a suggestion from the crew. A proud way of showing there is nothing to hide in this company. Here we work together and we all freely enjoy each other’s company. We all agreed this would be the way to do it.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480367798/zbcgtn90eynehzpxadcs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><h2>Meet the crew:</h2><p>Here are a few of the people who are going to work with Stella Track.

Please bare in mind, since this is a wishlist from the crew it is also a list of things that would not necessarily be in place in other companies. Apart from decent salaries, this is what we aim for</p><ul>
<li><i>If tip is included in the salary, then there is no need for taking unnecessary risks in order to secure a good tip.  The concern about getting a good tip or not, is eliminated and everyone can concentrate on the climb and the security of it.</i></li>
<li><i>We need to have a written company policy for everyone to read and agree to.</i></li>
<li><i>What if a climber is not feeling to good and has read a lot about things on the internet and insists on going down, even if it is not necessary? The opinion here was that the guide is educated and know the signs to be aware of. The tourists should listen to the guide. In case of a tourist scared beyond reasoning, the guides know how to deal with them, and help them. This is their responsibility. They are trained for this.</i></li>
<li><i>First aid training for all of the crew, not only the guides</i></li>
<li><i>Other cources too, like english or cultural understanding.</i></li>
<li><i>The climbers must fill in a health statement so the crew knows if anyone have special needs. Bad knees are not an issue if the crew knows about it – they can take special precautions for this. And if a climber lies, we have it on writing what they told us, and it is their responsibility if something goes wrong. No guide or porter should risk losing their job for something they had no clue about.</i></li>
<li><i>We need to carry oxygen and oximeter with us. If we should be in need of this, we should never be in a situation where we have to run to other groups or companies and borrow. Never!</i></li>
<li><i>When we have big groups – like in really big – we also need to have radios, so the guides can communicate in areas where there is no mobile cover.</i></li>
<li><i>As we grow as company we should also have all the kitchen gear, for a start the cook will bring his own, but eventually it would be great if we as a company have our own.</i></li>
<li><i>Some food can not be stored, like meat and fruit. One guide asks if we could skip one or two porters in the start of the climb and have them join later with fresh supplies. Another guide says we should go with the amount of crew required and if we need fruit or meat at the end of the climb, then this should be sent by the company as addition</i></li>
<li><i>One guide suggests we get ourselves a mini gas bottle with bulb. This can be used in the mess tent both as light and as heater, making it nice for the climbers while they wait for the food to be ready.</i></li>
<li><i>If it at one point will be possible it would be great if we could supply mountain gears, since this is very expensive. But if we can not, it is ok. (It was clear they did not want to ask for too much)</i></li>
<li><p><i>We should also state on the website that we will end the climb with the climbers and crew saying thank you and goodbye to each other. The crew will sing a song for the tourists as farewell – and this is just a song, not a plea for tip, as tips will be included in the salary.</i></p></li>

This is not 20-25 kg...</i></p><p>First of all not paying your crew a decent salary simply is not fair . Not to the Porters and not to the Adventurer who spent years saving for this trip. -  But furthermore it creates risks.</p><p>Climbing Kilimanjaro is an adventure of a lifetime, many people have been saving for years to do this. But what if the porters carrying all the luggage and equipment for the tourist adventurer, are not get anything from the company for it ? If they  depend solely on the tip you are able to pay them. If the tea the porters are enjoying as the tourists are having breakfast or lunch, is not after meal tea; it is the meal itself. Then what?</p><p>If the income is the tip, it becomes overly important to ensure the tip. Then the wishes of the customer becomes more important than company polices, or security gudielines. You might ignore important safety issues in order to keep your unaware customer happy enough to pay you a good tip. </p><p>If porters have not eaten properly or does not have a proper sleeping bag, if they are tired from carrying 35 kg on the back - then the people supposed to ensure your climb, might become a security risk them self.</p><p>Is this the kind of climb you would like? </p><h2>How would I know?</h2><p>Climbs up Kilimanjaro comes in most price levels. Low price companies, ie 1500 USD pr pax pr climb, or less, does not get enough revenue to pay the guide and porters a decent salary.</p><p>Porters are hired for each climb. Often the guides are the ones both hiring and handing out the wages to the porters, which is done in cash. The requirement is three porters per climber. With fewer porters there are fewer to share the portion of payment. It is possible to  get in with more weight than the official limit of 20 kg pr porter.</p><p>Now these conditions have been documented by others as well</p><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYYBEj467gk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Student documentary from 2011 </a> <br/><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxq-gWdVG5Y"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">How Porters are treated, by African Zoom. 2015</a><br/><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjoMD8bDjmo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A tourists experience from 2014</a><br/><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0-vF5EssxY&amp;amp..."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Porters of Kilimanjaro, 2012</a></p><p>The very people who ensures all the climbers achieving their goals should not be treated this way. The climbers finally having their goal of their dreams within reach should not have this experience stained by unknowingly being part of this oppressing system.</p><h2>Gathering the team</h2><p>Our story is simple: Scandinavian <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/helenavalorinta"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Helena</a> and Tanzanian <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/jacob.geoerge?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jacob</a> met when Jacob took Helena to the top of Kilimanjaro, where he, at the time,had been working for 13 years. (Long story very short: they fell in love and are now married.)</p><p>Helena saw people working their butts off on the trail up the mountain, some of them carrying way too much. Many of them without proper gear or even proper clothings. Jacob later explained that not all workers were treated fair on the mountain. Even though there are both guidelines and rules for this there was no consequence for not meeting the standards and many were the workers who worked far too much for far too little.</p><p><i>If only there was a Tanzanian company who would treat their workers fair</i>, Jacob said.<br/><i>Let’s create one!</i> - Jacob and Helena said simultaneously laughing</p><p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/lazurca.ramona?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ramona</a> from Romania and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/monika.zlatkova.7?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Monika</a> from Bulgaria had been studying entrepreneurship in Scandinavia together with Helena, and they soon joined in. Together the four of them started Stella Track, a company who offers climbs up Kilimanjaro where the crew is treated fair, paid reasonable payments, and where climbers and crew work together as a full team.</p><h3>Mobile payments</h3><p>But choosing to pay a little more does not in itself, solve the problem of fair payment. In order to be sure the payments go straight to the correct porter, cook or guide <strong>Stella Track will use mobile payments for paying salary and tip</strong>. An idea Monika came up with.</p><p>You see, in East Africa everybody has a mobile phone and mobile payments, is a well established system. More well established than in most western countries, actually.  Using the mobile payment system will also mean that apart from Stella Track the payments will be registered by the phone companies. In other words, all payments will be registered by a third, completely independant, party.</p><p>Jacob and Helena had a meeting with some of the guides, porters, and cooks who work on Kilimanjaro. Together they drew the outlines for Stella Track and how the crew would like a company like this to work.</p><p>This business idea is for a large part formed by the crew. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479847069/ho8eopyjn9mjt7l4qrfq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><h2>Finances</h2><p>Now this is all well, but it does not pay itself. In order to be able to provide this for the very people who makes the adventures possible for the climbers, we need money. There are licenses to be paid and gear to be bought and this is where we need your help.</p><p>We need to raise at least $33000 to get our company started. We also need to pay 18% in tax in Tanzania, from our crowdfunding income. To end up with $33000 we actually need to get $40000. This capital will enable us to cover our initial start up costs, from getting the right gear to paying the licenses required. After this, climbs sold should pay for expenses and salaries for each climb.</p><p>If there is one climb with 5 people, we need 1 guide, 2 assistant guides, 1 cook and 15 porters and one extra porter if they want a portable camptoilet with them. </p><h3>Crew gear for 20 people</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480966607/k6nguv3ijzoshyujgjkq.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Then there are other equipments, like different tents.

With five people we might be able to carry out with 4, 2-pax tents, if there is one couple among them. </p><p>Then there is safety equipment, cooking gear and so on.</p><h3>Equipment for a group with 5 climbers and 20 crew members</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480966212/ykk8suup9bwhegj7g6zf.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>Administration costs</h3><p>We are pleased to let you know we have the capital necessary to get the licenses needed.

The text here are for those who loves detailsWe have received a donation outside Indiegogo, so we now have the finances for the required licenses!!! We are in fact up and running as a company now, taking in bookings.And - We still appreciate any contributions you are willing to make :-) “Make an impact - climb Kilimanjaro the fair trade way”Richard Branson said, ""Emplyees come first. If you take care of your employees, they will care for the clients.""Now, on a mountain side, going for the top, this is not just desirably, it is essential. So we just told you about the conditions, what we need and how we intend to ensure the payments of fair salaries.Below you can chek all about how we intend to use the money we hope to get, find more info about working conditions about perks and a lot more. But first we would like to tell you about the kind of company we are creatingIntroducing Stella TrackIn order to make the climb as a team the climbers will be introduced to the crew at the starting gate. They will be presented with the name and responsibility of each crew member, so the climber knows who is carrying what, who is making the food and so on. This will eliminate any shadow workers – a shadow worker is someone who is not there. The climbers could be told there are fifteen workers when in reality there is only ten, it means there are five shadow workers. With fewer workers there are fewer to share the salary and the tip. A little more payment, a lot more work - and an appearance to be kept.Stella Track will be an open and transparent company where the crew will not have to pretend. The climbers will be able to approach any of the team members and walk freely around the camp while all the crew will be completely at ease, because there will be no inaccuracies to hide.This was agreed upon in a meeting we had with porters and guides who we are going to work with.We also talked about the possibility of eating together. This could be fixed with tourists having pasta, the crew ugali and then they would all have the same sauce – the problem was the mess tent. If everyone should  eat together the mess tent would have to be huge – and more porters would be needed to carry it.Instead they suggested people would eat separately like now, and then the climbers could come over and have their tea with the crew outdoor. They would also be welcome to visit the crew area and take pictures of the food being made, for instance.Again, this was a suggestion from the crew. A proud way of showing there is nothing to hide in this company. Here we work together and we all freely enjoy each other’s company. We all agreed this would be the way to do it. Meet the crew:Here are a few of the people who are going to work with Stella Track. Not everyone are willing to put their picture up here as they at the moment are working with other companies.  The wishes of the CrewThis is the wish list from the crew. Please bare in mind, since this is a wishlist from the crew it is also a list of things that would not necessarily be in place in other companies. Apart from decent salaries, this is what we aim for
If tip is included in the salary, then there is no need for taking unnecessary risks in order to secure a good tip.  The concern about getting a good tip or not, is eliminated and everyone can concentrate on the climb and the security of it.
We need to have a written company policy for everyone to read and agree to.
What if a climber is not feeling to good and has read a lot about things on the internet and insists on going down, even if it is not necessary? The opinion here was that the guide is educated and know the signs to be aware of. The tourists should listen to the guide. In case of a tourist scared beyond reasoning, the guides know how to deal with them, and help them. This is their responsibility. They are trained for this.
First aid training for all of the crew, not only the guides
Other cources too, like english or cultural understanding.
The climbers must fill in a health statement so the crew knows if anyone have special needs. Bad knees are not an issue if the crew knows about it – they can take special precautions for this. And if a climber lies, we have it on writing what they told us, and it is their responsibility if something goes wrong. No guide or porter should risk losing their job for something they had no clue about.
We need to carry oxygen and oximeter with us. If we should be in need of this, we should never be in a situation where we have to run to other groups or companies and borrow. Never!
When we have big groups – like in really big – we also need to have radios, so the guides can communicate in areas where there is no mobile cover.
As we grow as company we should also have all the kitchen gear, for a start the cook will bring his own, but eventually it would be great if we as a company have our own.
Some food can not be stored, like meat and fruit. One guide asks if we could skip one or two porters in the start of the climb and have them join later with fresh supplies. Another guide says we should go with the amount of crew required and if we need fruit or meat at the end of the climb, then this should be sent by the company as addition
One guide suggests we get ourselves a mini gas bottle with bulb. This can be used in the mess tent both as light and as heater, making it nice for the climbers while they wait for the food to be ready.
If it at one point will be possible it would be great if we could supply mountain gears, since this is very expensive. But if we can not, it is ok. (It was clear they did not want to ask for too much)
We should also state on the website that we will end the climb with the climbers and crew saying thank you and goodbye to each other. The crew will sing a song for the tourists as farewell – and this is just a song, not a plea for tip, as tips will be included in the salary.
 Why is this important to the customer, the climber?These are Helenas pictures from when she climbed Kilimanjaro in 2013. This is not 20-25 kg...First of all not paying your crew a decent salary simply is not fair . Not to the Porters and not to the Adventurer who spent years saving for this trip. -  But furthermore it creates risks.Climbing Kilimanjaro is an adventure of a lifetime, many people have been saving for years to do this. But what if the porters carrying all the luggage and equipment for the tourist adventurer, are not get anything from the company for it ? If they  depend solely on the tip you are able to pay them. If the tea the porters are enjoying as the tourists are having breakfast or lunch, is not after meal tea; it is the meal itself. Then what?If the income is the tip, it becomes overly important to ensure the tip. Then the wishes of the customer becomes more important than company polices, or security gudielines. You might ignore important safety issues in order to keep your unaware customer happy enough to pay you a good tip. If porters have not eaten properly or does not have a proper sleeping bag, if they are tired from carrying 35 kg on the back - then the people supposed to ensure your climb, might become a security risk them self.Is this the kind of climb you would like? How would I know?Climbs up Kilimanjaro comes in most price levels. Low price companies, ie 1500 USD pr pax pr climb, or less, does not get enough revenue to pay the guide and porters a decent salary.Porters are hired for each climb. Often the guides are the ones both hiring and handing out the wages to the porters, which is done in cash. The requirement is three porters per climber. With fewer porters there are fewer to share the portion of payment. It is possible to  get in with more weight than the official limit of 20 kg pr porter.Now these conditions have been documented by others as wellStudent documentary from 2011  How Porters are treated, by African Zoom. 2015A tourists experience from 2014Porters of Kilimanjaro, 2012The very people who ensures all the climbers achieving their goals should not be treated this way. The climbers finally having their goal of their dreams within reach should not have this experience stained by unknowingly being part of this oppressing system.Gathering the teamOur story is simple: Scandinavian Helena and Tanzanian Jacob met when Jacob took Helena to the top of Kilimanjaro, where he, at the time,had been working for 13 years. (Long story very short: they fell in love and are now married.)Helena saw people working their butts off on the trail up the mountain, some of them carrying way too much. Many of them without proper gear or even proper clothings. Jacob later explained that not all workers were treated fair on the mountain. Even though there are both guidelines and rules for this there was no consequence for not meeting the standards and many were the workers who worked far too much for far too little.If only there was a Tanzanian company who would treat their workers fair, Jacob said.Let’s create one! - Jacob and Helena said simultaneously laughingRamona from Romania and Monika from Bulgaria had been studying entrepreneurship in Scandinavia together with Helena, and they soon joined in. Together the four of them started Stella Track, a company who offers climbs up Kilimanjaro where the crew is treated fair, paid reasonable payments, and where climbers and crew work together as a full team.Mobile paymentsBut choosing to pay a little more does not in itself, solve the problem of fair payment. In order to be sure the payments go straight to the correct porter, cook or guide Stella Track will use mobile payments for paying salary and tip. An idea Monika came up with.You see, in East Africa everybody has a mobile phone and mobile payments, is a well established system. More well established than in most western countries, actually.  Using the mobile payment system will also mean that apart from Stella Track the payments will be registered by the phone companies. In other words, all payments will be registered by a third, completely independant, party.Jacob and Helena had a meeting with some of the guides, porters, and cooks who work on Kilimanjaro. Together they drew the outlines for Stella Track and how the crew would like a company like this to work.This business idea is for a large part formed by the crew.  FinancesNow this is all well, but it does not pay itself. In order to be able to provide this for the very people who makes the adventures possible for the climbers, we need money. There are licenses to be paid and gear to be bought and this is where we need your help.We need to raise at least $33000 to get our company started. We also need to pay 18% in tax in Tanzania, from our crowdfunding income. To end up with $33000 we actually need to get $40000. This capital will enable us to cover our initial start up costs, from getting the right gear to paying the licenses required. After this, climbs sold should pay for expenses and salaries for each climb.If there is one climb with 5 people, we need 1 guide, 2 assistant guides, 1 cook and 15 porters and one extra porter if they want a portable camptoilet with them. Crew gear for 20 peopleThen there are other equipments, like different tents. Then messtent for eating and relaxing. 3 larger tents for the crew to sleep in. They want to sleep many together as this keeps up the warmth in the tent. A kitchen tent for cooking, often the cook sleeps here too. With five people we might be able to carry out with 4, 2-pax tents, if there is one couple among them. Then there is safety equipment, cooking gear and so on.Equipment for a group with 5 climbers and 20 crew membersAdministration costsWe are pleased to let you know we have the capital necessary to get the licenses needed. The rest of the costs in this picture should be paid with the income from climbs..What if we dont reach the amount we are aiming for?Well, your money will not have been lost. We will start with whatever amount we reach. We will use the first sold trips to rent equipment until we have earned enough on sales, to buy our own.  We would definitely prefer to reach our goal here on Indiegogo - but if not, we will go ahead anyway with what we have. Is 33000 $ enough to fund an entire tour company?No. But it would get us started. After that the climbs should pay for running the company. It is our leap of faith assumption climbers will be willing to pay for decent working conditions for their mountain crew. And it all starts right here with you. Here is how you can help:1: Donate to our campaign2: Share our campaign on social media3: Follow and share us on Facebook: StellaTrack4: Come climb with us, and rate us on Tripadviser Are there any perks?A perk is great but can be costly.
