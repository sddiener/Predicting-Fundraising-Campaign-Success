<p>Since our beginning, Stay True has been helping low income, underpriveledged youth, not only to better themselves and grow as humans, but better their communities and the city as a whole. We do this through community service, the arts and a wide range of experiences our students would not otherwise have, due to their economic status. For instance, our camping trip to Hickory Run State Park in the Appalachian Mountains, where they get to leave the isolation of the inner city and see there is a whole different world waiting for them, and if they work hard enough they can break the chain of poverty and go anywhere!</p>
<p>With your generous donations we will be able to add another key ingredient into the Stay True experience for our students. Along with the arts and community service, we will be able to make parks and recreation beautification projects part of our core program. In ten years time our students will work on at least ten parks and recreation areas that will not only be fixed, but beautified and cared for when they are done. All thanks to the power of your donations.</p>
<p>In our research we have found that due to Philadelphia regulations, overhauling a parks and recreation area can cost between $5,000-50,000 per park. Although we would love to take on the more lofty projects, we understand that we are a small nonprofit, and though our students abilities are endless, it is your hearts and your giving that will determine the amazing things they are able to do.</p>
<p>For the past several years our students have made tangible changes to their communities and the city as a whole and we are now looking to up the ante. That is why we are here asking for your help. </p>
<p>For those who like what we are doing and are not able to support us monitarily at this time, please see our website at <a href=""http://www.stay-true.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.stay-true.org</a> and like us on Facebook at <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/StayTruePhilly"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/StayTruePhilly</a> to help get our message out there! </p>

</div></div>","The House of Panama (est. 1989), also known as the Casa de Panama, is a non-profit 501(c)(3) volunteer-run organization that presents the traditions, music and culture of the Republic of Panama to the public.  It has been working tirelessly for 25 
years - to bring the legacy of Panamanian culture to Balboa Park’s more than

10 million visitors annually.  We are drawn together by the love of 





Panama and desire to share that love with the world.  




Since its inception 25 years ago, the House of Panama has a long history in collaborating with Balboa Park for its Summer Lawn Program, Ethnic Food Fair, Queens Program and December Nights, among other Park offerings; as well as giving back to the community with annual scholarships.  
To mark its 25th Anniversary, the House of Panama was presented with a Resolution commemorating the anniversary by San Diego Council Member Todd Gloria and California Speaker of the Assembly Toni G. Atkins.                                                      
In 2014, the House of Panama expanded its public programming.  It hosted the internationally known Panama Brass band at the Balboa Park Club.  In 2015, it plans to host or co-host events featuring special guests, including:


Miss Universe 2002, Justine Pasek 
Miss Panama 2014 Yomatsy Hazlewood de la Rosa

Panama's Symphony Orchestra Banda Herberto Lopez JDC.  
Panama International Film Series

Panama City's Mayor Jose Blandon, for the signing of the Sister City Agreement with Mayor Kevin L. Faulconer of San Diego; in collaboration with the San Diego-Panama City Sister City Steering Committee.  The House of Panama, as an active participant on this Committee, is preparing to become the backbone of the San Diego-Panama City Sister City connection in San Diego to ensure its' long term sustainability.  




The House of Panama has been an official member since 1989 of Balboa Park's House of Pacific Relations, International Cottages - a consortium of cottage museums representing 33 nations that are situated at the heart of Balboa Park (http://www.balboapark.org/in-the-park/house-pac...). Nineteen of the 33 member nation groups have a Cottage Museum to share the culture, music,  foods, and arts of their countries.   The House of Panama has a 3 cubic foot display in which to house its artifacts in the Hall of Nations building.

                 





The House of Panama is actively involved in the New International Cottages Committee composed of nine member nations seeking to build their cottage museums adjacent to the existing cottages.  The Mayor of San Diego, Kevin L. Faulconer has expressed his support for the building of these nine new cottage museums for Panama, Colombia, India, Mexico, Lebanon, Palestine, Peru, Philippines, and Turkey.  





                     
The House of Panama is run exclusively by dedicated volunteers, including the Board of Directors below.  Our 2015 Legacy Campaign Team is eager to have you partner with us in reaching our Goal!

The House of Panama asks for your support to reach our 2015 Legacy Goal! 
Help us reach the $220,000 needed to build the 1st of its kind cottage museum dedicated to Panama in the USA; an institution that will last forever in the hearts and minds of visitors. 
The House of Panama’s Cottage Museum will be nestled in the heart of San Diego’s 1,200 acre Balboa Park; a cultural treasure which debuted for the 1915-16 Panama-California Exposition to celebrate the opening of our engineering marvel, the Panama Canal.Its time, 100 years later, for the House of Panama cottage museum to be built to showcase the rich and long history between Panama and San Diego… and more… to Balboa Park’s >10 million visitors/year.
Consider making a tax-deductible donation today… and visit our cottage museum of tomorrow!  Set to break ground in late 2015/early 2016, thanks to your contribution!  We’re excited to have you join us in making this journey possible!




The House of Panama Cottage Museum is the first known nonprofit Panamanian museum to be built outside of the Isthmus of Panama. The new 590 sq. ft. cottage museum construction will fulfill the historical architectural restrictions that Balboa Park requires in keeping to period Spanish Revival buildings.  With a basement, the first floor will be the museum and kitchen, and the basement will be used for storage.  The House of Panama will be sharing a restroom and stairway with the House of Colombia as seen in the plan below:  










Visitors to House of Panama's Cottage Museum will get a taste of the vibrant spirit and flavor of Panama, from the historic to the modern Panama of today.  Learn about the deep historical ties between San Diego and Panama; particularly the simultaneous debut of both the Panama Canal and Balboa Park for the 1915 Panama-California Exposition.  Discover the engineering marvel of the Panama Canal, one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World, in the process of its current expansion; five UNESCO World Heritage Sites (Casco Viejo/Panama Viejo, Portobelo/San Lorenzo, Coiba National Park, Darien National Park and La Amistad National Park), the cultural heritage of seven indigenous groups; the hotbed of biodiversity; the modern Frank Gehry designed Biomuseo; and the intricate handcrafts created by talented artisans.  The House of Panama Cottage Museum will house over 590 square feet of artifacts.  


WITHIN THE WALLS OF HOUSE OF PANAMA'S COTTAGE MUSEUM WILL BE:

An interactive display of the Panama Canal
Hands-on activities/crafts for children
Multiple displays and video of Panamanian culture, arts, history, biodiversity, retirement/tourist/business destination and cuisine
Rotating exhibits featuring Panama's talented artists, musicians, authors and athletes, among others
Musical workshops and concerts by talented musicians both local and from Panama, our Sister City
Culinary tastings 
Book signings by Panamanian authors
Folkloric presentations by House of Panama's Sonares de mi Tierra and Youth Folkloric group

Library of books showcasing Panama
Public programming, including hosting of visiting scholars, private tours, field trips/classes, and web-casting of events


Develop an appreciation of a country that, in the words of liberator Simon Bolivar, is ""Panama... PUENTE del Mundo, CORAZÓN del UNIVERSO"" (Panama, Bridge of the World, Heart of the Universe).  It only takes an hour to travel from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean by car. So cherished is Panama, that in 2014,  International Living ranked Panama the best retirement destination in the world, seven times in a row (http://internationalliving.com/2014/01/panama-worlds-best-retirement-haven-2014/).  
We'll take you inside the heart of this isthmus of Panama...
Who knows, you may want to visit soon!  We can't wait to bring Panama to you!

                  
The House of Panama needs $220,000 total to design and build the Cottage Museum.  To date, the House of Panama has raised $45,000 and received pledges totaling $85,000.  Of the $45,000 it has paid $18,000 for architectural plans and the permit process.  Now we need the remaining $135,000 to break ground, the goal of this IndieGogo Campaign.  
There is great momentum at this moment, as 2015 also marks the year the  Mayors of the Cities of Panama and San Diego will sign an agreement to become Sister Cities; the 25th anniversary of the House of Panama and continuing Centennial celebrations held throughout Balboa Park.

The history of Balboa Park in San Diego is directly linked to Panama going back 100 years to 1914; when Balboa Park opened to celebrate the opening of the Panama Canal during its 1915 Panama-California Exposition. The building of a House of Panama Cottage Museum in Balboa Park will cement the historical importance of the completion of the Panama Canal to the City of San Diego’s 1915 Panama-California Exposition.  
Passing on the legacy of Panama’s rich culture will be lasting.  Balboa Park has been around for 100 years and will be here for many generations to come.  
The 10 million visitors that visit Balboa Park annually will have access to the House of Panama Cottage Museum and it's numerous activities at Balboa Park.  

 

For 25 years, the House of Panama has lacked a physical space in which to expose Balboa Park visitors to its rich culture and history. It has been limited to attending organized events held outside, borrowed space from the House of Pacific Relations and other cottage museums; and a small 3 cubic foot display cabinet alongside 33 other countries in the Hall of Nations.  The Hall of Nations is undergoing a long-term renovation and is currently closed to the public, with the House of Panama display inaccessible to the public.                                   
                                  


With a physical Cottage Museum to call its own, the House of Panama hopes to inform visitors of the richness of the history and link to San Diego, as well as inspire millions of visitors to travel to Panama.   There is great momentum at this moment, as 2015 also marks the year the  mayors of the cities of Panama and San Diego will sign an agreement to become Sister Cities; the 25th anniversary of House of Panama and continuing Centennial celebrations held throughout Balboa Park.
House of Panama is an active participant on the Steering Committee of San Diego-Panama Sister Cities Connection.  Building a House of Panama cottage can help facilitate the exchange of cultural performances, development of a student exchange program, and help solidify economic partnerships among the Sister Cities.

</b></b><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p></p>
<p>My name is Ronald, or Ssekandi. Four years
ago, myself and a group of university students started a non-profit here in
Uganda (a registered NGO here). We were driven by our passion for writing,
debate and spoken word which had been tools to help us find and use our voices
and we believed they could be tools to help a generation of Ugandans find and
use their voices, critical thinking skills, and leadership capabilities. We
wanted to be a generation of people who were Writing Our World, telling and
living our own stories, growing into new stories. </p>
<p>Today—four years down the road—our dream has
blossomed. We run monthly writing workshops in Kampala, Uganda, quarterly
writing workshops in Kigali, Rwanda, and an annual debate tournament throughout
Uganda.  We’ve engaged with over 10,000 students in Uganda, Rwanda, and
Kenya.</p>
<p>Our vision is to see that our young
participants can develop critical thinking so that they are able to start
engaging head on the many challenges of our society with realistic, local
solutions. Our writing, debate and spoken word programs are designed to create
space for this kind of development until our schools are able to fill that gap
and provide critical and creative thinking, writing, speaking, living, and
leadership.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b></b></p><h3><b>What We Need</b></h3><p></p>
<p></p><p>In addition to the Uganda National Tournament (run in four regions of Uganda and sponsored by the US Embassy), we have for the past two years been taking the top students from each of these regions to participate in an East African Debate Tournament  exchange program with Kenya and  Rwanda. In this annual event, students gather in that year’s host country for 3 days in which they engage in debate and public speaking competitions, and leadership training.</p><p>Below is a photo of me (Ssekandi) speaking before students in western Kenya during a preparation session before last year's East African Debate Tournament.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1304670/files/20150318022959-Ssekandi_pic_with_assembly_-_more_mbs.jpg?1426670999"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This year, the 3rd East Africa Debate
Tournament will take place in <b><i>Kigali Rwanda</i></b> from <b><i>21st
to 23rd May 2015</i></b>. As an organization, we are taking <b><i>45
student debaters</i></b> and <b><i>15 staff members</i></b>. These students
have shown potential and excellence in our ongoing National Debate Program and
were chosen to represent Uganda at the Regional Program. The cost for each
student and staff member is $75. This covers three days lodging, food, program
costs (each team contributes towards the building space, awards and so forth),
and transport (we will rent a large bus, need to pay a driver and for gas, plus
border-crossing taxes). For 60 people at $75, the overall budget is $4,500.</p>
<p>This is where you come in. Most of these
students have been sourced from different parts of the country basing on merit
and not their financial capabilities. Schools aren’t able to provide these
sorts of critical extra-curricular activities and most of their parents are
already paying large sums in school fees, uniforms, books as we do not have
tax-dollar-paid education here.</p>
<p>Can you contribute to sponsor one of the 60
attendees? An amount of $75 would sponsor an individual in full, $37.50 would
pay for half of that individual’s sponsorship, and $18.75 would cover a quarter
of each individual sponsorship need.</p>
<p>Or give in any amount ($10, $25, $50, $100,
$200…) toward the team total of $4,500.</p>
<p>Students will be contributing towards their
place in the tournament as they will need to pay the fees to prepare their
immigration documents for the border. They will cover these both to keep that
item out of our budget as well as on principal that even if they have very
little; they still can find a way to participate and that they should
participate in their own growth and development. </p><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b></b></p><h3><b>The Impact &amp; The Value</b></h3><p></p>
<p>Allow me to throw light on the impact and
value of investing in these students, in this way. Though, as you know these
are people not projects so we can’t promise an outcome, we do believe that
investing in youth—especially their critical thinking and ability to speak,
finding and using their voice—is of peak importance. Here are some pieces of
information to give you a broader picture.</p>
<p><i>Here are some of the
topics these young people are being asked to debate for/against as they
participate in the tournaments:</i></p>
<ul>
<li>African
     governments should invest in sustainable land use as a measure for
     mitigating climate change.</li>
<li>With
     the current strategies, we believe Uganda is on course to win the fight
     against HIV/AIDS.</li>
<li>The
     government should impose a strict taxation policy in order to reduce
     income inequality.</li>
<li>The
     government should impose a minimum wage in order to improve the welfare of
     employees.</li>
<li>African
     governments have promoted and protected human and peoples' rights in
     accordance with the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights and other
     relevant human rights instruments.</li>
<li>The
     current government policy of affirmative action for women and girl child
     empowerment has uplifted the standards of women and girls at grass root
     levels.</li>
<li>The
     government of Uganda should put more emphasis on teaching of science and
     vocational courses over Arts and humanities.</li>
<li>The
     government of Uganda should ally more with the US rather than China as a
     development partner.</li>
<li>The
     government should shift priority from the Agricultural sector to the
     Industrial sector in order to transform Uganda from a peasant to a modern

The Short Story





My name is Ronald, or Ssekandi. Four years
ago, myself and a group of university students started a non-profit here in
Uganda (a registered NGO here). We were driven by our passion for writing,
debate and spoken word which had been tools to help us find and use our voices
and we believed they could be tools to help a generation of Ugandans find and
use their voices, critical thinking skills, and leadership capabilities. We
wanted to be a generation of people who were Writing Our World, telling and
living our own stories, growing into new stories. 
Today—four years down the road—our dream has
blossomed. We run monthly writing workshops in Kampala, Uganda, quarterly
writing workshops in Kigali, Rwanda, and an annual debate tournament throughout
Uganda.  We’ve engaged with over 10,000 students in Uganda, Rwanda, and
Kenya.
Our vision is to see that our young
participants can develop critical thinking so that they are able to start
engaging head on the many challenges of our society with realistic, local
solutions. Our writing, debate and spoken word programs are designed to create
space for this kind of development until our schools are able to fill that gap
and provide critical and creative thinking, writing, speaking, living, and
leadership.

What We Need
In addition to the Uganda National Tournament (run in four regions of Uganda and sponsored by the US Embassy), we have for the past two years been taking the top students from each of these regions to participate in an East African Debate Tournament  exchange program with Kenya and  Rwanda. In this annual event, students gather in that year’s host country for 3 days in which they engage in debate and public speaking competitions, and leadership training.Below is a photo of me (Ssekandi) speaking before students in western Kenya during a preparation session before last year's East African Debate Tournament.
This year, the 3rd East Africa Debate
Tournament will take place in Kigali Rwanda from 21st
to 23rd May 2015. As an organization, we are taking 45
student debaters and 15 staff members. These students
have shown potential and excellence in our ongoing National Debate Program and
were chosen to represent Uganda at the Regional Program. The cost for each
student and staff member is $75. This covers three days lodging, food, program
costs (each team contributes towards the building space, awards and so forth),
and transport (we will rent a large bus, need to pay a driver and for gas, plus
border-crossing taxes). For 60 people at $75, the overall budget is $4,500.
This is where you come in. Most of these
students have been sourced from different parts of the country basing on merit
and not their financial capabilities. Schools aren’t able to provide these
sorts of critical extra-curricular activities and most of their parents are
already paying large sums in school fees, uniforms, books as we do not have
tax-dollar-paid education here.
Can you contribute to sponsor one of the 60
attendees? An amount of $75 would sponsor an individual in full, $37.50 would
pay for half of that individual’s sponsorship, and $18.75 would cover a quarter
of each individual sponsorship need.
Or give in any amount ($10, $25, $50, $100,
$200…) toward the team total of $4,500.
Students will be contributing towards their
place in the tournament as they will need to pay the fees to prepare their
immigration documents for the border. They will cover these both to keep that
item out of our budget as well as on principal that even if they have very
little; they still can find a way to participate and that they should
participate in their own growth and development. 

The Impact & The Value
Allow me to throw light on the impact and
value of investing in these students, in this way. Though, as you know these
are people not projects so we can’t promise an outcome, we do believe that
investing in youth—especially their critical thinking and ability to speak,
finding and using their voice—is of peak importance. Here are some pieces of
information to give you a broader picture.
Here are some of the
topics these young people are being asked to debate for/against as they
participate in the tournaments:

African
     governments should invest in sustainable land use as a measure for
     mitigating climate change.
With
     the current strategies, we believe Uganda is on course to win the fight
     against HIV/AIDS.
The
     government should impose a strict taxation policy in order to reduce
     income inequality.
The
     government should impose a minimum wage in order to improve the welfare of
     employees.
African
     governments have promoted and protected human and peoples' rights in
     accordance with the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights and other
     relevant human rights instruments.
The
     current government policy of affirmative action for women and girl child
     empowerment has uplifted the standards of women and girls at grass root
     levels.
The
     government of Uganda should put more emphasis on teaching of science and
     vocational courses over Arts and humanities.
The
     government of Uganda should ally more with the US rather than China as a
     development partner.
The
     government should shift priority from the Agricultural sector to the
     Industrial sector in order to transform Uganda from a peasant to a modern
     and prosperous society.
The
     government rather than the private sector should patron ventures in urban
     development.


There are many challenging facets of being a youth of East Africa. Here are three of the realities facing these youth--which you may not be aware of--as they make the transition into adulthood and look toward being critical thinkers in their own lives and in their communities:


They live in the most diverse country in the world.
While the country is one of the most politically stable in Africa, they haven’t had a leadership change in almost 30 years. (Next election is 2016).
Youth unemployment is, in varying estimates between 60-80%. (See the Brookings Institution Report, here is a sampling: “Youth unemployment remains a serious policy challenge in many sub-Saharan African countries, including Uganda. In 2013, youth (aged 15 to 24) in sub-Saharan Africa were twice likely to be unemployed compared to any other age cohort. For Uganda, in 2012, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics revealed that the share of unemployed youth (national definition, 18-30 years) among the total unemployed persons in the country was 64 percent. Given the rapid growth of the Ugandan population—three-quarters of the population are below the age of 30 years—coupled with the fact that the youth are getting better educated through higher access to primary and secondary education, a stronger focus on job creation for this cohort of people cannot be overemphasized.”)

In coming days we will add a video here to give you a visual taste of the debate programs, the youth, and the value of developing these critical thinkers, leaders, and creative minds.

<p><span>A journey of a 1000 miles must start with a small step, that's why I have applied for the <a href=""http://bootcamp.mit.edu/#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MIT Bootcamp 2016</a> this August, where I will get the chance to interact and create something meaningful with 49 other brilliant minds all around the world. I am humbled and immensely excited over the opportunity to be selected for this 3 months intensive bootcamp, which is being conducted by MIT at their campus (Cambridge, MA) and is being guided by the renowned entrepreneurship mentor, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/billaulet"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bill Aulet</a>. The bootcamp is a 3-month mentorship program that begins with a one-week, intensive, in-person training and culminates with a reunion at MIT. This is a highly selective program for highly motivated students. </span></p>

<p>My goal to attend the boot-camp is to:</p>
<p>1. Learn what more I need to do in my business model and product to convert into to a viable business, and most importantly, have a positive impact on our customers.</p>
<p>2. Coming for humble background (doesn't help that Forex is a pain in the neck), getting the right network can be quite difficult. MIT Global Entrepreneurship Bootcamp is the perfect platform for me to connect and network with the world's brilliant mentors, VC and entrepreneurs.</p>

I have gone to banks for loan, but they too have refused to process my application. I must admit, with the time ticking I really am beginning to feel the pressure and a bit disheartened. Nevertheless, the silver-lining to my story would be that MIT has generously granted me an extension in time to confirm by participation along with the course fees.

<p>Fortunately, I am receiving great support and encouragement from the common people. Yes, people like you. That's why I am still carrying the torch. I have reached 5000 USD after-all. With so many people supporting, how can I give up? So, here I am, asking you to help me not give-up.</p>
<p></p> <p></p> <p> </p>
<h3>Help me take this first step towards my journey!</h3> <p>I was inspired by <a href=""http://news.utexas.edu/2014/05/16/mcraven-urges-graduates-to-find-courage-to-change-the-world"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Adm.McRaven's speech</a> in Austin regarding the 10 life lessons to change the world. One of them made an immense impression on me. It goes something like this, </p>
<p><i>""For the boat to make it to its destination, everyone must paddle. You can't change the world alone — you will need some help — and to truly get from your starting point to your destination takes friends, colleagues, the good will of strangers and a strong coxswain to guide them.""</i></p>
<p>That's why I am turning to you, for your support in any amount. Even if each view end up with a contribution of 10$, I can still raise the entire amount and get to participate in this bootcamp. Even the tiniest amount has my gratitude!</p>
<p>Once the campaign ends, the money shall go towards tuition fees payable to MIT Bootcamp, my travel and housing for the 5 days in Cambridge, MA. If I exceed my funding target, I will use it as a seed capital for my startup -- Ideamaginative. </p>
<p>My startup, Ideamaginative, created with the sole purpose of proactively solving and helping organizations solve process related issues to enhance people's lifestyle. We basically take those solutions and help covert them into a business model with marketing and operation design support. How we do this is through our SaaS product -- CityWiz. The innovation in this product is the R3 architecture that is based on preferential pattern matching engine. This helps us to empirically predict the heterogeneous behavior of our target market (21-28) that can be mapped to business opportunities.</p>

Why me?<p></p>
<p>Having learnt engineering and how to design the processes of a system through my previous company experience, I wish to apply the same to make some difference in the lifestyle of people. This is how I believe I can truly add value to the community, and thereby, to me. Apart from that, I am honing my skills further through online courses by MIT, Wharton Business school and IE Business School. </p>
<p>Attending MIT Bootcamp will not only help understand and take necessary steps to build Ideamaginative to a company changing the face of processes in India, but also help me gain the necessary leverage that a person from humble background (retired father, bootstrapping non-IIT/IIM Entrepreneur from India) can't usually get to make their startups come to life.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Ideamaginative has its heart centered
     around proactively solving process problems that are people-centric.
     CityWiz too is design based on the same, how to make relocating as a thing
     people look forward to. Travelling is one of the best way a people can
     explore, leave their pond, and witness the world as it is. By travelling I
     don’t mean tourism, I mean really going to a place and staying there long
     enough to understand the differences in though processing and culture of
     the same. The fact that it is hindered by the silly reason for lack of
     proper system and resources in places is, frankly, very annoying to me.
     CityWiz, I feel, will help anyone who wishes to explore do it, without
     worrying the sidetracking details. Apart from that, the usage of the
     technology behind CityWiz can help digitized retails in the Indian market
     rapidly. In the sense, locating your demand will not be an issue, and
     small businesses which are being swallowed by internet giants like Amazon
     will thrive again. </span></p>

<h1><b>WE NEED YOU</b></h1>
<h2><b>Why this mobile movement?</b></h2>
<p>The Mobile Minaret,
with a profound message at its core, is vital to counter what is currently
dominant in cyberspace on the Quran. It is best suited to carry the message of understanding
HOW the Quran itself teaches critical thinking and I need your help to do
it. </p>
<p>Through the Mobile
Minaret we move the minaret or “lighthouse” from its frozen-in -time
architecture to the open mobile space calling to Muslims to wake up because it
is not our faith that has been seized, but the radical interpretation of the
Quran.</p>
<p>Critical thinking is
known as discernment (furqan) in the Quran. Quranic thinking becomes critical
when it evaluates the reasoning of a verse or sign (ayah): Such evaluation
must, however, as Islamic scholar, Mohammad Hashim Kamali, points out,
 “be carried forth in a constructive manner. The purpose of critical
thinking is to achieve understanding, evaluate viewpoints, ask questions and
solve problems. In general, our thinking is likely to become critical when
concrete learning experiences precede abstract thought, that is, when there is
thinking wedded with wisdom (hikmah).” </p>
<p>We best develop
Quranic critical thinking skills through dialogical learning, learning that takes
place through dialogue. Through dialogue with the Quranic text with neighbors,
with classmates, with a teacher or mentor, through a sharable video, a Facebook
page, through a Twitter message or SMS text message, our goal is take back the
Quran</p>

<h2><b>FAQ</b></h2>
<p><b>Why are you doing
this?</b></p>
<p>This Indiegogo campaign is designed
to further enhance the community, team collaboration, practical field-trials
and testing, and other areas that are part of the Mobile Minaret initiative. We
believe the power is in our community, but not just in the teams who create the
technology to develop this project, but many other people who want to play a role
in solving this grand challenge.</p>
<p>Crowdfunding is a great way in which
the general public can help contribute towards making the Mobile Minaret as
successful as it can be both in terms of raising resources as well as raising
awareness. We believe that everybody, from our backers on this campaign, to
teams, to members of our new community, can make a real difference.</p>
<p><b>Why the $63,900
figure?</b></p>
<p>After breaking down the costs of the
many moving parts associated with deploying, testing, and tracking this technology
as well as with establishing an infrastructure, and platform, our team
determined that this money will cover many of these initial costs.  </p>
<p>This is really just the first step.
The more we raise, the more we can do – let’s raise 10x that this amount so we
can further facilitate success of this the Mobile Minaret Movement. Help us
spread the word!</p>
<p><b>How do we know this
will be successful?</b></p>
<p>The team has consulted with a global
team of experts in structuring the requirements for how the Quran teaches
critical thinking. This process takes into account the growth of technology,
where we expect technology to be in the next five years, the extent of the
problem (e.g. how many Muslims do not know HOW the Quran teaches critical
thinking), and how attractive this would be to prospective teams.</p>
<p>With these exhaustive considerations
accounted for, we are very confident that the Mobile Minaret is going to net
incredible results. If we didn't have confidence in this, we wouldn't launch it
in the first place.</p>
<p><b>How much money from
the crowdfunding actually goes to Mobile Minaret campaign?</b></p>

Indiegogo/FirstGiving fees, every dollar goes towards the campaign.</p>

The team has consulted with a global
team of experts in structuring the requirements for how the Quran teaches
critical thinking. This process takes into account the growth of technology,
where we expect technology to be in the next five years, the extent of the
problem (e.g. how many Muslims do not know HOW the Quran teaches critical
thinking), and how attractive this would be to prospective teams.
With these exhaustive considerations
accounted for, we are very confident that the Mobile Minaret is going to net
incredible results. If we didn't have confidence in this, we wouldn't launch it
in the first place.
How much money from
the crowdfunding actually goes to Mobile Minaret campaign?
With the exception of the
Indiegogo/FirstGiving fees, every dollar goes towards the campaign.
What payment
methods do you accept?
We accept major credit cards.
Can I donate from
outside the USA?
Absolutely!
When will my perk
prizes be delivered?
We are currently estimating shipping
in January 2017.
I love what you are
doing! How can I help?
Great question! Go and see the 7 ways
in which you can help, all listed above. Also be sure to come and join the
community at mobileminaret.org and find out more.
Is shipping
included in the perks?
Yes.
Can I write-off my
contribution with my taxes?
Yes. You will receive a letter
confirming your donation.
I am a celebrity or
public figure and would like to endorse the movement or help in some other way.
How do I get in touch with you?
Please email Laleh
Bakhtiar, our Sr. Dir. Community who can
discuss this further with you.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

No More Hounding Kids to Do Homework!
The Incentify app manages the student's entire learning process, so that parent's no longer have to push their children to do their dreaded homework.  Instead, students become naturally motivated by the incentives which impel students to want to do homework on their own!

Incentivized Education

It's about time! Kids are chomping at the bit to get this app in their hands. Imagine an app that automatically tracks the student's achievements (not just grades, but also study time, how much they've learned, etc.), and instantly rewards them each week with micro-scholarships (cash & gift cards) right to their phone. The more the student learns, the more they earn. It's that simple. The results are higher grades, increased confidence, smarter students, and a more productive world. 






The Core Problem


Motivation is the crucial ingredient that unleashes productivity in all humans. Unfortunately if a student is not motivated to learn, they will never reach their highest potential. In other words, there is an underlying core problem in education which needs to be addressed. It's motivation! When this issue is resolved, students thrive abundantly.






The Solution

The Incentify app inspires students to want to learn, by utilizing weekly micro-scholarships which draws out the student's highest quality learning performance. 

The student's educational achievements are tracked and automatically awarded to their mobile wallet, providing the student with instant gratification.  They keep coming back for more and more and more!












Results

Incentify is a conduit for education dollars to be spent on what matters the most: Results! Our technology ushers in a much needed ""results based education"", where no money is transacted until the student has performed.  In other words we only pay for achievement!  No waste occurs here, only phenomenal results. We like to think of Incentify as ""The Cure For The Common Core"" by assisting students, teachers, schools, and the nation & world as a whole, with helpful education tools to bring up grades & performance.  







Who Pays the Students?

Corporations, foundations, government, and schools are already handing out scholarship money to incentivize and promote education.  Incentify automatically connects students to these and many other benefactors, which radically inspires them to learn.  Important to note: Neither the student or parents have to apply for the micro-scholarships; Incentify manages and rewards them automatically based on the student's performance!  Of course mom's & dads, aunts & uncles, and grandparents are encouraged to incentivize the students as well.

<p><b>INTERNATIONAL CONF<span style=""background-color: initial;"">ERENCE</span></b></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Since its foundation eight years ago, the International Conference within the Subversive Festival has soon become an unavoidable place for critical theory not only in Croatia and wider East European region, but also worldwide. Zagreb has become a traditional meeting point for leading philosophers, economists, theorists and feminists from around the globe, such as Slavoj Žižek, Gayatri Spivak, Chantal Mouffe, Tariq Ali, Zygmunt Bauman, David Harvey, Antonio Negri, Michael Hardt, Gianni Vattimo, Renata Salecl and many others. The Large Hall in Cinema Europe is often too small to accommodate the whole of the interested public, while we get extensive news coverage in regional, but also European media of lectures and discussions taking place in Zagreb. In the first three years the conference was dedicated to different anniversaries (’68, the Chinese Cultural Revolution, the Non-Aligned Movement), while the last five festival editions (2011-2015) covered contemporary themes such as the Arab Spring and the Future of Europe and have hosted the architect Remo Koolhaas, economists Yanis Varoufakis, Costas Lapavitsas, and Steve Keen, the theorists Naomi Klein and Judith Butler, the anthropologist David Graeber, the green activist Vandana Shiva, LGBT pioneer Boris Dittrich and many others. The topics which the conference covers year after year include the defence of the commons, workers' solidarity, the idea of Europe, heterodox economy, intercultural bonds, green economy etc. </span></p>

<p><b>SUBVERSIVE FORUM</b></p>
<p>Subversive Forum is the activist part of the Subversive Festival, fostering discussion and debate, which complements the International Conference. While the conference takes place in the evening, in the form of keynote lectures or round tables, the idea behind Subversive Forum is to provide space for dynamic discussion with the audience, and not only between speakers. With the average attendance of 70-150 visitors per debate, and being the Festival's „youngest child“, Subversive Forum has in a very short time become a platform for theory and activism recognised by the World Social Forum. Moreover, Subversive Forum is involved with other European mobilisation fronts such as the European Altersummit or Firenza 10 + 10. It has also established partnerships and long-term collaboration with the European Transform Network for alternative thinking and political dialogue, CADTM (Committee for the Abolition of the Third World Debt), Eurozine (the network of 80 European magazines), Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung, Heinrich Böll Stiftung and other active participants conceptualizing the program, panels and debates. One of the most important parts of Subversive Forum is Balkan Forum, which gathers 40 different organizations from the Balkans. As from this year, we have also launched the Mediterranean Forum which will deal with the important topics of the region.</p>

Yassin Mahi Mallin 2016YOUR EFFORTS MAKE DIFFERENCE
My name
is Yassin Mahi and would like to thank all my follow friends for
their support and endorsement to run for president in the upcoming election in
2016.
Having
observed the hostile political situation in Somalia over the last two decade,
I engaged actively in a political campaign to enhance democratic process in
Somalia.
My
vision is to find suitable solution to eradicate the self-destructive culture
of tribalism in our nation, which will be a pragmatic and continuous
process.
I
encourage you, for the sake of a prosperous Somalia, to engage actively in our
campaign and contribute to the success of our candidate. By doing this you
contribute to a clan-free, safe and democratic Somalia.
   How to become a sponsor 

Welcome

a voluntary basis and need all the support I can get to make changes for
the future of Somalia.

Pleas you can donate $1, $5, $10, $25, etc US dollar. This is how you can

Risks & Challenges
It is very clear that serving in Somalia will not be easy.  There will be challenges and obstacles.  But when there is a problem there is a solution
Serving Somali community indefinitely comes with challenges like security challenges, Political disputes, road blocks, less resource, and frustration. There are political and economic domination.  There are many mindsets that avoid change.  There are many ineffective and inefficient procedures and processes. 
To solve these problems We have planned to requesting help from the community!  There may appear to be a lack of resources but there is no lack of will in our community which may help us go above and beyond what we think is possible.  There may appear to be a lack of money but there is no lack of people willing to collaborate.  There may appear to be a roadblock in the path forward but through communication we can find people on the other side of the road block to guide us around.  There may appear to be a political disputes but we can solve our disputes through reconciliaction and mediation.

environment along their regional waterways while paddling. Forty students who,
20-30 years from now, may be scientists, teachers, legislators, lawyers, and

</div></div>","Just as we teach our children about road safety and water safety, teaching them about body safety is important, especially our little ones who just want to be good and do what the 'big person' says. But, how does one put across a topic like this to them? Children love to hear stories, right? What better way to do so than through storytelling?Following research and discussions with counselors and parents, this interactive storybook app ”Dancing Spiders,"" is being created to enlighten children about inappropriate touch and to alert them to a danger point - like refusing to go with a stranger who offers to show the child something attractive. It is a simple, non-threatening storybook app but the knowledge a child gains from it is very powerful. This knowledge just may prevent a child from a lifetime of trauma. Message within an enchanting storyDancing Spiders will deliver a magical experience with touch-triggered animation, narration, music and sounds for young readers. The story is fun and engaging; it is set in a magical forest where a group of children play and mingle with their magical friends and creatures. One of the children is lured away from his friends. The interactivity of the app empowers the reader to think about the situation in the shoes of the character and decide which path to take to progress with the story - like saying “no” to touching that makes him uncomfortable. 
The book has been written and illustrated in a way that is neither frightening nor confrontational. To address the sensitivity of the topic, the creators use magical creatures in the story and yet, convey the message. Like have you seen a magical horse grazing in the forest? :)The illustrator has cleverly worked around the difficult parts in order to make the app wholesome and suitable for young children. There is nothing in the book that is scary to the child, because nothing is explicit, Check out the sneak peek of a section of the app below.
Features



Touch-triggered animation


Narration, music and sounds 


Readers will have the option to take them through the story, or read the story themselves.


PLUS  ....  The storybook app helps the readers to develop thinking
skills.  The reader has to make a decision in the shoes of the character to handle a danger point in the story. The reader will have two options to choose from. How the story turns out depends on the decision taken. This allows the reader to understand the consequence of each of
the decision, and hence, the sensible action to take. It reinforces learning. 


The app can be downloaded on the Apple app store and Google Play. It’s a must for parents, doting uncles and aunties, schools, childcare givers … Or anyone who wants to help kids live smart. 
Knowledge is powerful and to be forewarned is forearmed.



Plus, Plus ....
The creators have sneaked a little interactive game into the storybook app too.. so that reading can be more enjoyable!


UPDATE!
We have added a new Early Bird Special perk. For only $3 - You will enjoy your Dancing
Spiders app at a special price before anyone else!





We
need
your support to bring this entertaining and
interactive storybook app to life. 








Every contribution helps in getting this storybook app out to help young children.
The funds will be required for professional copy-editing, illustration, artwork, narration, voice over talents, recording, rental of recording studio, animation and programming to produce the English-language version of this app. 
(A stretch goal will be to print this book to benefit more children, especially those who do not have a mobile device.)
We hope to attract not just support and funding, but like-minded adults to come forward to share our passion to help children pick up life skills, share their stories and be involved in future book projects. 



We'd like to reach out to you to help our children 'live smart'. If this book helps a child and from being scarred psychologically, we'll have one more happy child among us. 
Join in to help our kids live smart. Thank you!

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>Ephesians Child Care Center has been providing quality child care free of charge for homeless &amp; low-income families in Berkeley for 40 years. This place has become an institution in the community &amp; has been an unceasing advocate for the right of all people to have access to the quality services they need to sustain a healthy life for themselves &amp; their families. <p></p>
<p>Spiral Gardens Community Food Security Project was created in two vacant lots that lie along the old Santa Fe Railroad line and has served as not only a nursery &amp; farm, but a learning center &amp; community resource that has introduced a bounty of organizations &amp; individuals to the potential of urban gardening &amp; farming. </p>
<p>Moon Wise Counseling &amp; Life Hacking serves marginalized communities and offers resources for healing while increasing essential life competencies, such as increasing awareness of our reality as Earth-based creatures. All of these organizations provide unique &amp; valuable contributions to communities that are traditionally systemically neglected. </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Together these potent organizations will provide children in difficult circumstances with an invaluable opportunity to learn about:</span><br/></p>
<p>- how to recognize beneficial plants in their natural, urban environments</p>
<p>- how to use these plants for food &amp; medicine</p>
<p>- how to care for these plants to sustain their personal health &amp; the health of their families &amp; communities.</p>
<p>Using this information, they will then be able to share with their families &amp; friends outside of the program, serving as seeds themselves, to spread this knowledge through communities in need of accessible &amp; affordable forms of self care.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1358536/files/20150406023141-103924742.jpg?1428312701"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<h3>Potential Risks</h3>
<p>The only real risk is not having enough resources for all of the children to have a quality experience. The collective expertise of Spiral Gardens, Ephesians Children Center and Moon Wise ensures for the safety of the children at all times. </p>
<p>""I Can Take Care of Myself!"" kits will be carefully marked and come with important information about the herbs included to prevent any harmful chemical interactions from their use.  Children will be instructed to always let an adult know when they use their kits and to consult the information included for safety. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help </h3>
<div>There are always ways outside of direct money that can help. <p></p>
<p>- If you have extra planters, gloves, etc. around your house, please bring them over! we'd much rather up-cycle than use unnecessary resources</p>
<p>- If you have some extra time one afternoon to be a chaperone on a nature walk, please let us know!!</p>
<p>- If you can volunteer with set-up or clean-up for the Planting Day Celebration, give us a holler!</p>
<p>- And last, but certainly not least, SPREAD THE WORD! We want this program to become an at least yearly endeavor, and to hopefully develop a school-year long program. We are applying for a grant to expand the program to include cooking &amp; the larger families; letting people know this exists can help us reach our goals not just in the present but the future! </p>

Ephesians Child Care Center has been providing quality child care free of charge for homeless & low-income families in Berkeley for 40 years. This place has become an institution in the community & has been an unceasing advocate for the right of all people to have access to the quality services they need to sustain a healthy life for themselves & their families. 
Spiral Gardens Community Food Security Project was created in two vacant lots that lie along the old Santa Fe Railroad line and has served as not only a nursery & farm, but a learning center & community resource that has introduced a bounty of organizations & individuals to the potential of urban gardening & farming. 
Moon Wise Counseling & Life Hacking serves marginalized communities and offers resources for healing while increasing essential life competencies, such as increasing awareness of our reality as Earth-based creatures. All of these organizations provide unique & valuable contributions to communities that are traditionally systemically neglected. 
Together these potent organizations will provide children in difficult circumstances with an invaluable opportunity to learn about:
- how to recognize beneficial plants in their natural, urban environments
- how to use these plants for food & medicine
- how to care for these plants to sustain their personal health & the health of their families & communities.
Using this information, they will then be able to share with their families & friends outside of the program, serving as seeds themselves, to spread this knowledge through communities in need of accessible & affordable forms of self care.





Potential Risks
The only real risk is not having enough resources for all of the children to have a quality experience. The collective expertise of Spiral Gardens, Ephesians Children Center and Moon Wise ensures for the safety of the children at all times. 
""I Can Take Care of Myself!"" kits will be carefully marked and come with important information about the herbs included to prevent any harmful chemical interactions from their use.  Children will be instructed to always let an adult know when they use their kits and to consult the information included for safety. 



Other Ways You Can Help 
There are always ways outside of direct money that can help. 
- If you have extra planters, gloves, etc. around your house, please bring them over! we'd much rather up-cycle than use unnecessary resources
- If you have some extra time one afternoon to be a chaperone on a nature walk, please let us know!!
- If you can volunteer with set-up or clean-up for the Planting Day Celebration, give us a holler!
- And last, but certainly not least, SPREAD THE WORD! We want this program to become an at least yearly endeavor, and to hopefully develop a school-year long program. We are applying for a grant to expand the program to include cooking & the larger families; letting people know this exists can help us reach our goals not just in the present but the future!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3>
<p>My name is Theresa Guinasso and I have created a non-profit organization called Girl Power that is dedicated to informing, empowering and encouraging women (especially young women) who are suffering from low self-esteem and possibly suicidal thoughts. We teach them how to be holistically healthy with a strong sense of
self-esteem so they can live beautiful, productive lives that contribute
positively to our society. </p>
<p>When I was in high school I became very depressed to the point of considering suicide as a way out. At that point my mother gave me a book that talked about the mind/body/spirit connection and something clicked inside. Next I read You Can Heal Your Life and got involved in a spiritual community. These things catapulted me into a completely different state of mind and I began to heal. It took many years and many more books, therapy (both traditional and alternative) to really get me on track, but I got there.<br/></p>
<p>Eventually I majored in Art and minored in Psychology at Cal Poly, SLO, got married, and had a daughter, now 20 and attending Cal Poly herself. While she was growing up I worked slowly and therapeutically on my Master's Degree in Transformational Studies and Integral Psychology. So now, after 30+ years of personal growth and development work I really want to help young women like myself. <br/></p>
<p>About 5 years ago I almost died from gall-bladder disease and 4 years ago I got a divorce, between the two I re-evaluated everything. I did have a private practice life coaching and doing cranial-sacral therapy but during those situations it dissolved. Then I was offered an opportunity to own a yoga studio. I had always wanted to create a healing center so I gave it my all, unfortunately that didn't work out. (Long story) None-the-less, I am still all about healing and supporting those on their path.  Healthy and strong  at this point I got involved in a great business coaching program that really encouraged me to work with young women, they could see I was passionate about it and I had all the right stuff. The past 2 years I have poured my heart and soul, not to mention, all of the finances I had, into it. Now I am at a crossroads and praying for a miracle.<b> Would you consider being part of that miracle? </b>It would mean everything to me but far more importantly it would make a huge difference in the lives of many young women.</p>

<h3>The Program Works!<br/>

<p>
</p>
<p>      “I believe this program has changed my life permanently.
Introducing this resource to others like me could be a HUGE help. My thinking
process has been altered in a beautiful &amp; positive way. I can sleep at
night, my panic attacks are less frequent and I can finally see the light! I’m
learning to love myself and respect my body, and I am learning to live a
positive and healthy life. This program has showed me how to address challenges
with a completely different approach. </p>

 been so powerful that some girls have shared that they have stopped 
drinking, cutting, eating poorly or not at all and hating themselves. (Which of course touches me deeply) Most of the girls want to continue meeting and are asking for the program to continue.

gehörte zu den führenden Persönlichkeiten der revolutionären

Wandel in der revolutionären Bewegung. Im Gegensatz zu anderen
68´ern Revolutionären wie Deniz Gezmis oder Mahir Cayhan
 unterschied er sich mit seiner Ablehnung der Staatsideologie
des Kemalismus und der Deklaration dieser als Faschismus von vielen
anderen der revolutionären Bewegung. Auch war er derjenige, der
umfassend auf die Situation der kurdischen Bevölkerung einging und
dafür plädierte, ihnen ihr Selbstbestimmungsrecht zuzugestehen.
Seine Thesen und Werke gehen detailliert auf revolutionäre
Fragestellungen ein und erarbeiten diese ausführlich. Dem türkischen
Staat waren und sind seine Ansichten ein Dorn im Auge und man
fürchtete sich vor einer Verbreitung dieser, weswegen man ihn,
nachdem man ihn inhaftierte, nach langer und kaltblütiger Folter,
umbrachte. Die CIA klassifizierte die Thesen des gerade einmal 24
jährigen Kaypakkayas als die politisch gefährlichsten Thesen in der
Türkei.  Seine Schriften sind in der Türkei verboten und
Personen, die diese verbreiten, müssen mit drakonischen Sanktionen,
fast ausschließlich Haftstrafen, rechnen. Es gestaltet sich somit
schwierig, seine Werke einer breiten Öffentlichkeit zugänglich zu
machen. Mit dem vorliegenden Werk bietet sich uns nun die
Möglichkeit, seine Werke in deutscher Sprache zu publizieren. Dazu
benötigen wir jedoch finanzielle Hilfe, die wir dazu nutzen wollen,
das Buch drucken zu lassen.</p><p><b>Inhalt und

<p><b>Ibrahim
Kaypakkaya - Selected Works</b></p><p>This
campaign wants to finance a reprint of the selected works Ibrahim
Kaypakkaya's and aims at printing and publishing them in book
form.<br/>For printing the book, we require financial support.<br/>This
is a non-profit-campaign. All of the proceeds from the sale of the
book will be donated to political prisoners in Turkey.</p>
<p>--------------------
</p><p><b>Background
Information about Ibrahim Kaypakkaya</b></p>
<p>Founder of the Turkish
Communist Party/Marxist-Leninist and of the People's Liberation Army
TIKKO.</p>
<p>Ibrahim Kaypakka was
part of the leading personalities of  the revolutionary movement
in Turkey and marked a change in the movement with his theories. 
In contrast to other 68 revolutionaries like Deniz Gezmis and Mahir
Cayan, he distinguished himself from many other revolutionaries by
rejecting the state ideology of Kemalism and declaring it as fascism.
He was also the one who referred to the situation of the Kurdish
population and spoke up for their right to self-determination.<br/>His
theses and works focuse in detail on revolutionary questions and
elaborate them.<br/>His political views were and still are considered
dangerous by the Turkish state and therefore their distribution is
feared. So Ibrahim Kaypakakkaya was arrested and tortured to death
after a long period of coldblooded torture.<br/>The CIA classifies the
theses of the only 24 year old Kaypakkaya as the politically most
dangerous theses in Turkey and the Middle East.<br/>His writings are
banned and persons, who do distribute them, are going to face
draconian penalties, almost exclusively long-term-imprisonment.<br/><br/>So
it's very difficult to make his writings accesible to a broad public.
The present project now gives us the chance to publish his writings
in German language. But for achieving this, we need financial
support, which we want to use to print this book.</p>
<p><b>Content</b></p>
<p>1. Criticism of the
TIIKP's Programm <br/>2. General Criticism of the
Safak-Revisionism<br/>3. Views on Kemalism<br/>4. The National Question
in Turkey (The Kurdish Issue)</p>
<p><b>Information,
Numbers and Facts</b></p>
<p>At
first the book will be translated into German and will be followed by
its French translation. The first edition of the book (German/French)
will consist of 500 copies. When needed, the second edition will also
be printed with 500 copies.<br/>The book will be sold online
(<a href=""http://www.kaypakkaya.de"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.kaypakkaya.de</a>) and via direct sales.<br/><br/>The book
format is: A5, coloured soft-cover, 90gr paper b/w<br/><br/>The aim is
to print and to publish the book (german version)  until May 2015. The french version will be translated and printed as soon as possible. <br/><br/>For further

Gründer
der Türkischen kommunistischen Partei / Marxistisch-Leninistisch und
der Volksbefreiungsarmee TIKKO
Ibrahim Kaypakkaya
gehörte zu den führenden Persönlichkeiten der revolutionären
Bewegung in der Türkei an und markierte mit seinen Theorien einen
Wandel in der revolutionären Bewegung. Im Gegensatz zu anderen
68´ern Revolutionären wie Deniz Gezmis oder Mahir Cayhan
 unterschied er sich mit seiner Ablehnung der Staatsideologie
des Kemalismus und der Deklaration dieser als Faschismus von vielen
anderen der revolutionären Bewegung. Auch war er derjenige, der
umfassend auf die Situation der kurdischen Bevölkerung einging und
dafür plädierte, ihnen ihr Selbstbestimmungsrecht zuzugestehen.
Seine Thesen und Werke gehen detailliert auf revolutionäre
Fragestellungen ein und erarbeiten diese ausführlich. Dem türkischen
Staat waren und sind seine Ansichten ein Dorn im Auge und man
fürchtete sich vor einer Verbreitung dieser, weswegen man ihn,
nachdem man ihn inhaftierte, nach langer und kaltblütiger Folter,
umbrachte. Die CIA klassifizierte die Thesen des gerade einmal 24
jährigen Kaypakkayas als die politisch gefährlichsten Thesen in der
Türkei.  Seine Schriften sind in der Türkei verboten und
Personen, die diese verbreiten, müssen mit drakonischen Sanktionen,
fast ausschließlich Haftstrafen, rechnen. Es gestaltet sich somit
schwierig, seine Werke einer breiten Öffentlichkeit zugänglich zu
machen. Mit dem vorliegenden Werk bietet sich uns nun die
Möglichkeit, seine Werke in deutscher Sprache zu publizieren. Dazu
benötigen wir jedoch finanzielle Hilfe, die wir dazu nutzen wollen,

Ibrahim Kaypakkaya a
fait parti des leaders du mouvement révolutionnaire en Turquie et a
marqué un changement dans le mouvement avec ses théories.En
contraste avec les autres révolutionnaire en 68 comme Deniz Gezmis
ou Mahir Cayan, il s’est distingué des autres révolutionnaires en
rejetant l’idéologie d’état – le kémalisme, en le déclarant
comme étant fasciste. Il s’est également distingué en
parlant de la situation des kurdes et à parler en faveur de leur
droit à l’auto-détermination.Ses thèses et ses œuvres
parlent et élaborent les problématiques révolutionnaires.Ses
prises de positions politiques étés et sont toujours considéré
comme dangereuses par l’Etat Turc qui en avait peur. Ibrahim
Kaypakkaya a donc été arrêté et longtemps torturé de sang-froid
jusqu’à la mort. La CIA considère les thèses de
Kaypakkaya (qui avait que 24 ans) comme les thèses politiques les
plus dangereuses de Turquie et de Moyen Orient.Ses écrits sont
interdits et les personnes qui les diffusent font face à des
condamnations draconiennes, souvent des emprisonnements à vie. Il
est par conséquent très dur de rendre ses écrits disponibles à un
large public. Ce projet est une chance pour publier ses œuvres en
langue allemande. Mais pour le faire, nous avons besoin d’un
soutien financier qui nous servira à imprimer ce livre.Contenu1.

Background
Information about Ibrahim Kaypakkaya
Founder of the Turkish
Communist Party/Marxist-Leninist and of the People's Liberation Army
TIKKO.
Ibrahim Kaypakka was
part of the leading personalities of  the revolutionary movement
in Turkey and marked a change in the movement with his theories. 
In contrast to other 68 revolutionaries like Deniz Gezmis and Mahir
Cayan, he distinguished himself from many other revolutionaries by
rejecting the state ideology of Kemalism and declaring it as fascism.
He was also the one who referred to the situation of the Kurdish
population and spoke up for their right to self-determination.His
theses and works focuse in detail on revolutionary questions and
elaborate them.His political views were and still are considered
dangerous by the Turkish state and therefore their distribution is
feared. So Ibrahim Kaypakakkaya was arrested and tortured to death
after a long period of coldblooded torture.The CIA classifies the
theses of the only 24 year old Kaypakkaya as the politically most
dangerous theses in Turkey and the Middle East.His writings are
banned and persons, who do distribute them, are going to face
draconian penalties, almost exclusively long-term-imprisonment.So
it's very difficult to make his writings accesible to a broad public.
The present project now gives us the chance to publish his writings
in German language. But for achieving this, we need financial
support, which we want to use to print this book.

TIIKP's Programm 2. General Criticism of the

<p><b>CHOCOLATE ARTE PROJECT: ART- EDUCATION-CULTURAL EXCHANGE</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>My Name is Laura Reiman, I am a visual artist and art teacher.</p>
<p>I started the Chocolate Arte project out of a concern for our awareness of the foods we eat and where they come from, and of course out of a personal love for chocolate and a growing interest for it's rich cultural history. The project consists of two parts that I am developing simultaneously: a growing portrait gallery of people from all over the world painted in pure chocolate (which is currently visible at the <a href=""http://www.peppermango.nl/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">PepperMango</a> in Amsterdam), and an art education program for children about the history of chocolate and cacao. In order to develop the art education program I need financial help, because it involves travelling, research, development of the program and materials and equipment have to be purchased.</p><p>Voor een Nederlandstalige uitleg van dit project bent u welkom op </p><p><a href=""http://www.chocoweb.nl/steun-chocolate-arte-het-gezicht-van-chocolade/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.chocoweb.nl/steun-chocolate-arte-het-gezicht-van-chocolade/</a><br/></p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>WHY CHOCOLATE?</b></p>
<p>About two years ago a documentary on the chocolate industry showing African cocoa farmers who had never tasted chocolate in their life before shocked many people here in the Netherlands, including me: it showed how alienated we are from the foods we grow and consume. That same year I had visited Oaxaca, Mexico and I was impressed by the many ways in which cacao was an integral part of the traditional kitchen  and cultural celebrations. It has a complete different status and function in society than here in Europe, where it is mostly consumed as candy. Within this one food, cacao, there is so much history, so many different cultural uses, and at the same time so much ignorance still of it's origins and the current cultivation and productions methods used.</p><p></p><p><b>CHOCOLATE PORTRAITS</b></p>
<p>Being a visual artist, I wanted to find a way to show how cacao and chocolate are experienced by people in these three continents in such different ways. I also thought it would be fantastic if somehow they would be able to exchange this cultural knowledge with each other. So I came up with the idea to paint people from Latin America, Europe and Africa in chocolate and to assemble them all together in a growing collection of portraits, in an effort to 'visually reconnect' them, by making them all the same material and color: chocolate.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1134364/files/20150106053747-portraits.jpg?1420551467"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>
</p><p>Making a visual statement is a good way to raise more awareness generally, but for me it is not doing enough so far. Since I am an art teacher and have experience working with children and designing educational programs I decided to also set up an exchange program through art workshops for children of the different continents, in which they learn about the cultural and historical aspects of chocolate and cocoa by investigating them in their own culture and sharing them with children of other countries. This way they investigate their own culture and learn about other cultures at the same time.</p><p><b>DEVELOPING AN ART EDUCATION PROGRAM  ABOUT THE  HISTORY OF CACAO FOR CHILDREN OF DIFFERENT CONTINENTS</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1132101/files/20150105025035-IMG_5146.JPG?1420455035"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The aim of this project is to set up an art education and cultural exchange program for children of Europe, Latin America and Africa, in which the children discover the history of chocolate and the many diffrent cultural uses through art and cooking workshops, by sending recipes back and forth and by learning about the origins of food, and about cultural traditions in relation to food.<div>In the end everything the children make and discover during the workshops will be documented and collected in an international art/cook book about chocolate.<br/>
<p> </p>
<p><b>WITH THIS CROWDFUND I AIM TO FINANCE THE FIRST PHASE OF THIS PROJECT</b></p>
<p>The first phase of this project will be the development of the art education program for children in Europe and Mexico. The second phase will include workshops in Ecuador and Africa, and presenting the children's investigations, recipes and art of the three continents in the book and a traveling exhibition, together with the chocolate portraits that I am painting during this project.</p>
<p>I plan to travel to Chiapas and Oaxaca Mexico first, to do research and to develop the education program working together with el Museo del Cacao in San Christóbal in Chiapas. </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.kakaw.org/museo-del-cacao-y-chocolate.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Museo del Cacao y Chocolate, Chiapas Mexico</a><br/></p>
<p>While there, I will also paint a series of portraits of the cacao farmers in chocolate. After that, I will travel to Oaxaca where most of Mexico's cacao is being consumed in many different dishes and drinks, in order to investigate the use of cacao in Oaxacan culture together with a group of children, through a series of art workshops. The children are aged between 6 and 12 and they are taken care of by the organisation ""Hijos de la Luna"". The families of these children can not take care of them mostly because of poverty, and the organisation is always in need of volunteers and teachers so I decided it would be a good thing to work with them and give them some extra support. They are also very enthusiastic about the project, so it promises to become a good and interesting collaboration. For more info on the organisation feel free to visit their website: </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.hijosdelaluna-en.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.hijosdelaluna-en.org/</a></p>
<p>After this I will share all the information resulting out of this workshops with a group of children from Amsterdam that I already work with as an art teacher and caregiver in the after school hours. The follow up will be a series of workshops with these children about the history of chocolate in Mexico and the history of chocolate here in Amsterdam, Europe, in order to share this again with the children of Mexico.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p><b>WHAT IS NEEDED FOR PHASE ONE</b></p>
<p>In order to develop the education program, do research and set up the connection between a group of children from Oaxaca and from Amsterdam I calculated that I need at least  €10.000, this will cover a time span of 6 months of research and development of the education program.</p>

<p>For every donation of €100,- you will be painted in chocolate and become part of the traveling exhibition. </p>
<p>For a donation of €500,- you will get a portrait painted in chocolate which will be sent to you.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>THE IMPACT IT WILL MAKE</b></p>
<p>With this project I hope to raise a sense of awareness when it comes to cacao and chocolate, and actually to food en general; from the people who cultivate and grow the food, through it's processing and consumption. </p>
<p>If in the and we manage to develop an education program about chocolate that can be applied by art teachers in all countries where chocolate plays a relevant role in the culture or economy, this would seriously be a valuable addition to de mainstream education programs, as it teaches children in a creative way about the origins of cacao and chocolate and it's uses in their own culture, and in others. This in turn, teaches children a general sense of awareness when it comes to food and it's origins and cultural context. They learn to see how food and culture are connected and they learn about other cultures in comparison to theirs. Also, they will learn to investigate history in a playful, creative way, skills that will help them develop a sense of curiosity and independence for the rest of their lives and last but not least: it will help them build and maintain a healthy and conscious relationship to the foods they consume, not only knowing where they come from, how they are grown and prepared, but also how to be creative with it themselves.</p>
<p>It will hopefully also make an impact by raising awareness of the sometimes challenging situations children are in in some countries and where necessary improve their economical conditions and changes of developing through education.</p>
<p><b>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</b></p>
<p>The history of cacao and chocolate will be explored through different art disciplines like drawing, writing, cooking, filming, music, animation, whatever suits the theme and the situation at that moment best.</p>
<p>Because the whole idea of the workshops is based on dialogue and exchange, a lot of the content and the outcome will be determined through the process itself. It will depend on the situation, on what is available in the direct environment and what the children's needs are at that moment. The idea is that they do not only learn about cacao and it's cultural history, but also language and communication skills, artistic expression, research skills, working together, presenting, sharing information, amongst other things. The workshops are set up to be a genuine art project working towards a real presentable book and exhibition, but at the same time they are designed to educate and share knowledge.</p>
<p>The big challenge in this first phase will be to get an exchange between children from different countries going in spite of the language barrier and sometimes also technological or logistical difficulties. We will have to see to what extend the information comes across and how we adapt ourselves and the content of the workshops so that it will. I do speak both Spanish and Dutch fluently so this will be a necessary help in translating certain things, but the idea is that the children feel like they are directly sharing things with each other.</p>
<p>Another challenge is the distance and the lack of physical contact which may be an obstacle in establishing a relationship.</p>
<p>Another challenge will be the local circumstances that one can never foresee a 100% and being able to be flexible enough to still follow up on the program while making certain adaptations when necessary.</p>
<p><b>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</b></p>
<p>Of course we need financial help with this project, but if you can help in any other form it is just as welcome: think of publicity, equipment, (also second hand camera's, computers, art materials), all is very welcome</p>
<p>The whole project can be followed on</p>

In order to develop the art education program I need financial help, because it involves travelling, research, development of the program and materials and equipment have to be purchased.Voor een Nederlandstalige uitleg van dit project bent u welkom op www.chocoweb.nl/steun-chocolate-arte-het-gezicht-van-chocolade/
WHY CHOCOLATE?
About two years ago a documentary on the chocolate industry showing African cocoa farmers who had never tasted chocolate in their life before shocked many people here in the Netherlands, including me: it showed how alienated we are from the foods we grow and consume. That same year I had visited Oaxaca, Mexico and I was impressed by the many ways in which cacao was an integral part of the traditional kitchen  and cultural celebrations. It has a complete different status and function in society than here in Europe, where it is mostly consumed as candy. Within this one food, cacao, there is so much history, so many different cultural uses, and at the same time so much ignorance still of it's origins and the current cultivation and productions methods used.CHOCOLATE PORTRAITS
Being a visual artist, I wanted to find a way to show how cacao and chocolate are experienced by people in these three continents in such different ways. I also thought it would be fantastic if somehow they would be able to exchange this cultural knowledge with each other. So I came up with the idea to paint people from Latin America, Europe and Africa in chocolate and to assemble them all together in a growing collection of portraits, in an effort to 'visually reconnect' them, by making them all the same material and color: chocolate.
Making a visual statement is a good way to raise more awareness generally, but for me it is not doing enough so far. Since I am an art teacher and have experience working with children and designing educational programs I decided to also set up an exchange program through art workshops for children of the different continents, in which they learn about the cultural and historical aspects of chocolate and cocoa by investigating them in their own culture and sharing them with children of other countries. This way they investigate their own culture and learn about other cultures at the same time.DEVELOPING AN ART EDUCATION PROGRAM  ABOUT THE  HISTORY OF CACAO FOR CHILDREN OF DIFFERENT CONTINENTSThe aim of this project is to set up an art education and cultural exchange program for children of Europe, Latin America and Africa, in which the children discover the history of chocolate and the many diffrent cultural uses through art and cooking workshops, by sending recipes back and forth and by learning about the origins of food, and about cultural traditions in relation to food.In the end everything the children make and discover during the workshops will be documented and collected in an international art/cook book about chocolate.
 
WITH THIS CROWDFUND I AIM TO FINANCE THE FIRST PHASE OF THIS PROJECT
The first phase of this project will be the development of the art education program for children in Europe and Mexico. The second phase will include workshops in Ecuador and Africa, and presenting the children's investigations, recipes and art of the three continents in the book and a traveling exhibition, together with the chocolate portraits that I am painting during this project.
I plan to travel to Chiapas and Oaxaca Mexico first, to do research and to develop the education program working together with el Museo del Cacao in San Christóbal in Chiapas. 
Museo del Cacao y Chocolate, Chiapas Mexico
While there, I will also paint a series of portraits of the cacao farmers in chocolate. After that, I will travel to Oaxaca where most of Mexico's cacao is being consumed in many different dishes and drinks, in order to investigate the use of cacao in Oaxacan culture together with a group of children, through a series of art workshops. The children are aged between 6 and 12 and they are taken care of by the organisation ""Hijos de la Luna"". The families of these children can not take care of them mostly because of poverty, and the organisation is always in need of volunteers and teachers so I decided it would be a good thing to work with them and give them some extra support. They are also very enthusiastic about the project, so it promises to become a good and interesting collaboration. For more info on the organisation feel free to visit their website: 
http://www.hijosdelaluna-en.org/
After this I will share all the information resulting out of this workshops with a group of children from Amsterdam that I already work with as an art teacher and caregiver in the after school hours. The follow up will be a series of workshops with these children about the history of chocolate in Mexico and the history of chocolate here in Amsterdam, Europe, in order to share this again with the children of Mexico.





WHAT IS NEEDED FOR PHASE ONE
In order to develop the education program, do research and set up the connection between a group of children from Oaxaca and from Amsterdam I calculated that I need at least  €10.000, this will cover a time span of 6 months of research and development of the education program.
BY DONATING YOU HELP REALISE



the trip to Mexico, to investigate the history of cacao and develop an art education program suitable for children in different continents
Setting up the connection between a group of children from Amsterdam and a group of children from Mexico
Buy materials and multimedia equipment necessary for the art classes and intercontinental exchange like camera's, computers, but also cooking equipment and ingredients, paint, paper, clay, ink, canvas etc.
Pay local art teachers or cooks to give additional workshops if needed 





WHAT YOU GET
Everyone who donates will be listed in the art/cookbook we will eventually make as a contributor to the project.
For every donation of €100,- you will be painted in chocolate and become part of the traveling exhibition. 
For a donation of €500,- you will get a portrait painted in chocolate which will be sent to you.


THE IMPACT IT WILL MAKE
With this project I hope to raise a sense of awareness when it comes to cacao and chocolate, and actually to food en general; from the people who cultivate and grow the food, through it's processing and consumption. 
If in the and we manage to develop an education program about chocolate that can be applied by art teachers in all countries where chocolate plays a relevant role in the culture or economy, this would seriously be a valuable addition to de mainstream education programs, as it teaches children in a creative way about the origins of cacao and chocolate and it's uses in their own culture, and in others. This in turn, teaches children a general sense of awareness when it comes to food and it's origins and cultural context. They learn to see how food and culture are connected and they learn about other cultures in comparison to theirs. Also, they will learn to investigate history in a playful, creative way, skills that will help them develop a sense of curiosity and independence for the rest of their lives and last but not least: it will help them build and maintain a healthy and conscious relationship to the foods they consume, not only knowing where they come from, how they are grown and prepared, but also how to be creative with it themselves.
It will hopefully also make an impact by raising awareness of the sometimes challenging situations children are in in some countries and where necessary improve their economical conditions and changes of developing through education.
RISKS AND CHALLENGES
The history of cacao and chocolate will be explored through different art disciplines like drawing, writing, cooking, filming, music, animation, whatever suits the theme and the situation at that moment best.
Because the whole idea of the workshops is based on dialogue and exchange, a lot of the content and the outcome will be determined through the process itself. It will depend on the situation, on what is available in the direct environment and what the children's needs are at that moment. The idea is that they do not only learn about cacao and it's cultural history, but also language and communication skills, artistic expression, research skills, working together, presenting, sharing information, amongst other things. The workshops are set up to be a genuine art project working towards a real presentable book and exhibition, but at the same time they are designed to educate and share knowledge.
The big challenge in this first phase will be to get an exchange between children from different countries going in spite of the language barrier and sometimes also technological or logistical difficulties. We will have to see to what extend the information comes across and how we adapt ourselves and the content of the workshops so that it will. I do speak both Spanish and Dutch fluently so this will be a necessary help in translating certain things, but the idea is that the children feel like they are directly sharing things with each other.
Another challenge is the distance and the lack of physical contact which may be an obstacle in establishing a relationship.
Another challenge will be the local circumstances that one can never foresee a 100% and being able to be flexible enough to still follow up on the program while making certain adaptations when necessary.
OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP
Of course we need financial help with this project, but if you can help in any other form it is just as welcome: think of publicity, equipment, (also second hand camera's, computers, art materials), all is very welcome

 The Innovative IdeaPromoting education in this part of the world is itself a novel idea for the masses. To work for any change is a challenge in the region. Dewa achieves its objectives through working on ideas that affectively convinces the masses. Dewa attracts female enrollments in the schools by employing female faculty in its schools. Employing female faculty has been a challenge, however, the foundation has successfully engaged the rare enlightened families in the region who lets their educated women to work. Dewa’s bamboo and mud structures are themselves unique in the region which is cost-effective, weather and earthquake resistant. Dewa foundation works to sustain the low-cost education in the rural areas by its schools in the urban centers through its idea called joycation. Under the joycation, the relatively higher tuition fee in the urban cities is used to sustain the Dewa schools in the rural and tribal areas. Salient features of Dewa Foundation SchoolsInitially One class, one teacher, simple but gradual progress. 
Urdu + English as a medium of instruction.
Regular monthly tests for higher classes.
Special emphasis on English and Arabic.
Character building as a part of syllabus.
Central examination system.
Competent and hard working teachers.
Proper guidance for co-curricular activities.
Same curriculum and scheme of study for all school.
Regular moral and professional training for teachers.
Generous offer for needy and orphan students.

  Unfortunately, DEWA foundation is constrained in ways that hinder the full impact it can make in the communities. Firstly, in order to achieve the fully facilitate the female teachers employed in the premises, it is looking to initiate a transportation service for these employees. Secondly, the biggest challenge for any non-profit organization has to be the shortage of funds. The young enthusiasts of DEWA foundation are working hard on collecting the donations so the cause never stops. As the children (with scholarship ratio 30:70) in the DEWA foundation schools are studying free of cost, the money donated can never be enough. So, here is an appeal to all the people out there to donate as much as you can so this noble cause doesn't end here.We are hence, earnestly requesting you to contribute wholeheartedly to the campaign to allow us to continue our endeavors at full steam and make a dent in the education sphere in Balochistan.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>Why Aprende 24? </strong></h3>
<p>The right to a quality education that enables individuals to provide sustenance and participate fully as productive members of society, is a right that is honored by most governments around the globe. </p>
<p>However, the reality in the Dominican Republic is that despite recent gains in spending on public education and other reforms, a large sector of the population still does not have access to the quality of education and/or the proper tools and supplemental content that are essential for academic success.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508970285/jxnspvnobf9oqqzbiegt.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>A high quality education is the proverbial key that opens the doors of opportunity and prosperity. Research findings consistently show a direct correlation between inadequate education levels and political, economic and social marginalization. These conditions offer little hope of escape from the cycle of poverty or for attaining self-sufficiency.</p>
<p><strong>English Language Training</strong>  Record growth in the telemarketing, phone support services and tourism industries, has made English language proficiency essential for top employment and entrepreneurial opportunities in the Dominican Republic. A recent government study found that lacking English proficiency resulted in a 60% loss in salary and gratuities for the same job position. Most people either can't afford tuition and travel expenses to attend English classes at a local language center or cannot commit to classes that may be scheduled at times that are inconvenient or unsafe for traveling to at night. <i><strong>Aprende 24</strong></i>  will offer free self-guided English courses through its streaming channel. For an affordable monthly fee, teacher-guided online classroom courses will be offered through its on-demand channel.</p>
<p><strong>Culture &amp; Society Learning </strong>Much of what is available in the local broadcast media in the Dominican Republic, does not reflect, represent nor appeal to the racial, ethnic and class realities of the vast majority of its citizens. We feel that it is imperative that people, (especially impressionable youth) see themselves in the media as more than entertainers, athletes, and victims or perpetrators of illegal activities and violence. The studio of <i><strong>Aprende 24</strong></i>  will be a place where young educators, activists and artists can collaborate to create socially-conscientious and empowering video content for distribution to the general public and school classrooms over the <i><strong>Aprende 24 </strong></i>network. </p>
<p><strong>Science &amp; STEM Learning  </strong>More than 90% of schools in the Dominican Republic do not have science labs or facilities for scientific demonstrations and practical experiments. In <strong>Phase II </strong>of its development, <i><strong>Aprende 24 </strong></i> will expand its operations to include a studio set that will facilitate the production of supplemental science education content to subscribers. This content will be aligned to the national school curriculum as stipulated by <strong>MINERD</strong>, the government's education authority. Guest teachers and students from local schools will be invited to our video-recording studio to conduct science experiments and demonstrations. During the post-production process, animation, interactive simulations as well as related video content will be added to complement in-studio video footage. Subscription service for this content will be open to educators and/or family households. Subscribers will log into the <strong><i>Aprende 24 </i></strong> science channel and have on-demand access to episodes that correspond with their specific lesson plan. Review and assessment resources will be provided to teachers to download and utilize in their classrooms. In the lead up to launching the <strong>Phase II</strong> supplemental science initiative, <strong><i>Aprende 24 </i></strong> will engage students with a weekly STEM-based broadcast program.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p><i><strong>Aprende 24 </strong></i> is seeking to raise funds in the amount of <strong>$19,450</strong> for the successful launch of Phase I of this educational initiative. Following is a summary breakdown of where the funds will be spent:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509050332/hfm2mlqofsphvtd0vgym.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</strong> If we <i><strong>do not</strong></i>  reach our fund-raising goal, we will scale back our        <strong>Phase I</strong> operations in the following manner:</p>
<ul>
<li>Utilize a much less expensive HD webcam instead of the Sony HD camcorder </li>
<li>Scale back studio costs by utilizing an extra room in the residence rather than a separate building/office location</li>
<li>Forego streaming of free English language proficiency courses and opt for paid on-demand streaming access for self-study students and for students enrolled in teacher-led online courses </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong><i>Aprende 24</i></strong>  has met with management at several local cable television stations. While these stations were excited about our initiative and offered access to professional studio space and equipment, broadcasting costs and scheduling slots offered to our program made terrestrial television a nonviable option. For this reason we turned to the WebTV concept. By developing our own network and streaming online, we can reach a much larger audience and empower under-served and disadvantaged students anywhere on the island where they have Internet access.</p>
<p>Any new venture must quickly establish it's worth in a tangible way. Because it literally can be the difference between landing a job or not getting hired, English proficiency is a highly-sought after marketable skill. This is precisely why we chose to focus initially on creative ways to bring English language education to a wide audience of students. However English is only the beginning. We're also excited about the potential for <i><strong>Aprende 24</strong></i>  to take the lead on future initiatives as well. Once we have established a successful track record of engaging students, teachers and parents and building a loyal audience, we foresee our ability to expand our reach into school campuses and the community with initiatives such as: </p>
<ul>
<li>Inspiring youth to produce media and inviting them to become content providers and <i><strong>Aprende 24</strong></i>  broadcast partners</li>
<li>Motivating youth to strive for academic excellence by conducting science fair competitions, scholastic tournaments, STEM contests, spelling bees and art exhibits and covering all of these events on the <i><strong>Aprende 24</strong></i>  network</li>
<li>Developing character and raising self-esteem by recognizing student performance in the classroom and in their communities on the <i><strong>Aprende 24</strong></i>  broadcast network</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><i><strong>Aprende 24</strong></i>  will have to develop multiple income streams to sustain operations. The four primary income sources will be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Advertising</li>
<li>Student Fees &amp; Tuition</li>
<li>Subscriptions for On-Demand Access</li>
<li>Broadcast Content Providers/Partners</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Advertising</strong> Generating advertising accounts will be a bigger challenge than normal because of cultural abnormalities. In the Dominican Republic, corporations and business owners generally do not see the value in associating their brand with education or youth activities. We will strive to reverse this mindset by giving much visibility to our initial advertisers and sponsors with in-stream commercials, on our mobile application, on our website and during our interviews on local television and radio programs.</p>
<p><strong>Student Fees &amp; Tuition </strong>Let's face it, most students are simply not disciplined enough for self-guided/self-study courses. Therefore, we're confident that once they see the free English language classes on the free-access streaming channel, many students will see the value of enrolling in a teacher-led class with other students. Our aggressive social media marketing campaign will focus more so on the added benefits of the paid course over the free self-study option.</p>
<p><strong>Subscriptions for On-Demand Access </strong>Although this is primarily an option for the Phase II supplemental science and STEM learning initiative, once the program schedule of the free-access streaming channel begins to fill with programs from content provider/partners, we will offer a subscription plan for on-demand access to the English language courses for self-study students. </p>
<p><strong>Broadcast Content Providers/Partners  </strong>We will solicit and review content from individuals or groups for possible broadcast over the <strong><i>Aprende24</i></strong>  network. Provided that the content meets our guidelines and the required advance broadcasting fee has been secured, monthly, 3 month. semiannual or annual contracts will be drawn up and notarized by our legal representative. </p>

My name is Julia Fournier and I want to become a director!
 I am also an actress, now I feel the pulse to become a director and tell my own stories. I spent one year living in Colorado, USA, I am from Spain. And I fell in love with the place. I found this great school COLORADO FILM SCHOOL.
http://coloradofilmschool.co/_/acting-directing/
And it is a shame but I cannot afford the NON-RESIDENT TUITION. That is why I am asking for help. I want to study ACTING/DIRECTING there in the next two years. 
What I would love to do in the future and I am trying to do it now... with little resources, is create stories that make feel something to the audience, anything.

<p><strong>My name is Liliya Murdock; I am an early childhood educator with a Bachelor’s Degree in Early Childhood education from Chestnut Hill College<i>, a</i>nd I’m also a new mom. I have <i>5 </i>years of experience as a teacher in Bala Cynwyd School for Young Children that is a highly reputable preschool in the greater Philadelphia area, and the topic of childcare and quality parent-child time has interested me since I first studied early childhood education.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I strongly believe that children learn through play; unfortunately, unless they are enrolled in a high quality childcare facility, I have seen that there are not enough opportunities for children to develop their social and emotional skills and reach other important developmental stages. </strong></p>
<p><strong>This realization has inspired me to contribute my talent and experience to provide high quality services and a safe and creative environment that will be beneficial for both parents and children. I have been working with children for more than ten years, and I have provided exceptional education and service to families I have worked with one-on-one as well as in school and preschool settings.  Through Play-Date Café, I can reach many more families, introduce important skills to children, and share critical educational knowledge with parents and caregivers. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The idea for the Café came about as a solution for my own dilemma: what to do with my children when the weather is too cold, too rainy, too hot, or on days that I can’t entertain them at my own house? I also know many stay-at-home/work-at-home parents who wish there was a place for their children to be engaged and entertained so they can get their work done without worrying about safety, learning materials, tools and other creative enhancements. </strong></p>
<p><strong>I selected Bucks County PA as the location for the Café based on my research of other spaces that offer recreation and education to children and their families. Unfortunately there are not many to choose from: local libraries, Bounce U, Little Gym, and the Philadelphia or Elmwood Park Zoos, which are not conveniently located for many people. There is a great opportunity for indoor space with safe equipment, toys, classes, and a warm, family-like atmosphere. </strong></p>
<p><strong>In order to provide this solution to the community, I have set a fundraising goal of $25,000, which will go towards the first two months of rent and utilities, equipment, toys, licensing, certifications, advertising, permits, furniture, and supplies for the Café, mini-office, and soft-play area.  I am offering a 10% discount towards a reserved birthday party for each family who contributes to the campaign. Come and celebrate your child’s birthday at our Play-Date Café indoor playground!</strong></p>
<p><strong>We would love to open the doors to the Play-Date Café in time for the winter holidays, so families throughout the Northeast Philadelphia area can make use of our services and keep us in mind when they are looking for places to bring their children. Now we need your support to make this a reality, and we invite you to participate in our fundraising! If you are unable to contribute yourself, we hope that you will share this invitation with others who may be able to support our idea and help us to make this dream a reality. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Thank you!</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Problem in South Sudan</strong></p>
<p>The women of South Sudan are industrious. Take Agnes for example. She buys bags of sweet potatoes and hires men to carry them across the border into Congo. There, they trade them for teak poles which are then loaded onto trucks back in South Sudan and driven to Kampala, Uganda. Agnes then hires a car to beat the trucks to market, where she then sells the teak poles. The funds from the sale are now reinvested into used clothing which she ships to South Sudan and markets through her three local retail stores. Profits from the sale of the clothes are then used to hire boys to make bricks, which she builds into a basic house that is then rented out.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.eyeradio.org/south-sudan-highest-illiteracy-rate-unesco/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">All of this to make enough money to pay the school fees for her children. If enough money does not come in, the girls are the first to lose out.</a></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><i><strong>Sanaa is the swahili word for work of art.</strong></i></p>
<p>Sanaa Music Workshop is an education program that provides young musicians with the tools to thrive in the ever-changing musical landscape. Traditionally, music programs focus solely on artistic development. While this is absolutely necessary, it is only half of what is required for a successful career in the performing arts. Sanaa immerses students in exercises that focus not only on improving musicianship but also on the processes of marketing, selling and branding what is being created. With Your help, we can bring this program to the music students who need it most. </p>
<h3>Sanaa Music Workshop</h3>
<p>It is our goal to merge the worlds of music and business. Most, if not all arts programs, ignore the monetization process and focus solely on performance and technical musical ability. For example, standard arts programs teach students how to paint, play, and create beautiful art but fail to teach students how to make a living using their skill sets. We believe that we are here to enrich this community with a different type of arts program. We are passionate about improving students’ odds for a successful, lucrative and fulfilling career in the arts. We’ll do this by giving them a complete set of skills and always looking ahead to innovations and tools that will help them and us learn and progress.</p>

<h3>What you can do to help.</h3>
<p>By contributing to this project you will directly affect a student's life. We will use the funds collected to provide scholarships, financial aid, lunch, and pay for other operating expenses. Reduced rates and scholarship opportunities will be available to students who qualify because you have decided to be a part of the solution. Dismantling financial barriers for arts education is one of the many obstacles we intend to fight. In order to do these things, we need to raise 20,000 dollars. This money will fund the camp for two years and allow us to provide a high-quality educational experience for little to no cost.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Your contribution will help us prepare a generation of students for the challenges they will face in today's marketplace. Hopefully helping them to realize the potential they have for monetizing their creations and skill sets. By allowing students to apply their creativity to developing marketing, branding, and selling skills, we can eradicate the ""Artist Myth"". A line of thinking that relegates artist to a life of poverty.</p>

</div></div>","Introduction
Sanaa is the swahili word for work of art.
Sanaa Music Workshop is an education program that provides young musicians with the tools to thrive in the ever-changing musical landscape. Traditionally, music programs focus solely on artistic development. While this is absolutely necessary, it is only half of what is required for a successful career in the performing arts. Sanaa immerses students in exercises that focus not only on improving musicianship but also on the processes of marketing, selling and branding what is being created. With Your help, we can bring this program to the music students who need it most. 
Sanaa Music Workshop
It is our goal to merge the worlds of music and business. Most, if not all arts programs, ignore the monetization process and focus solely on performance and technical musical ability. For example, standard arts programs teach students how to paint, play, and create beautiful art but fail to teach students how to make a living using their skill sets. We believe that we are here to enrich this community with a different type of arts program. We are passionate about improving students’ odds for a successful, lucrative and fulfilling career in the arts. We’ll do this by giving them a complete set of skills and always looking ahead to innovations and tools that will help them and us learn and progress.

Sanaa Music Workshop and The New Orleans Jazz Market

<h3> </h3>
<p>We are Fortune and Friends Theatre and we are taking our show 'Finding Uhuru' to schools in Tanzania. </p>
<p>We are a new company based in London and aim to specialise in creating theatre for children around the world. This is our first venture out and we decided why not go large the first time round. There are lots of ways to learn about doing something and one of those is simply getting out there, and getting on with it. We are fortunate enough to be sponsored by Anada Overseas Education based in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. </p>
<p>Our company (From left to right) consist of:  Jamie Littlewood (<i>Director</i>), A sulky looking Brian Chandrabose (<i>Uhuru</i>), Imran Momen (<i>Sound and Tech</i>) and Alexandria Anfield (<i>Cordelia</i>)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479565440/mm5rzcveyk5eq0jqny8v.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>This campaign is to help us get the equipment to make a documentary about taking our show to Tanzania.</i></p>
<h3>The Impact - What are we doing?</h3>
<p>Along with schools in Dar es Salaam will also be travelling outside of the main towns and cities and performing in some of the poorest regions of Tanzania, where most likely this kind of venture will never have been experienced before. </p>
<p>Our play focuses on:</p>
<p>- Bullying<br/>- Gender equality<br/>- Professional aspirations </p>
<p>We hope to inspire the children of Tanzania and show them that despite their perceived limitations, they have the capabilities to excel in whatever they choose in life. They are the future of Tanzania and the world as a whole. </p>
<p>After each performance the team will run an hour workshop with the students to explore the themes of the play, what they have learnt and most importantly how they can apply it to their own lives. </p>
<p>Brian Chandrabose (A Tanzanian National) will be leading part of the workshops and is a fluent Swahili speaker. </p>
<h3>The Process - How are we doing it. </h3>
<p>We face the challenge of making sure that the children of Tanzania understand our show. To solve this problem we will have the show performed in both English and Swahili with subtitles projected in both languages.</p>
<p>The play follows the journey of the two characters; Uhuru and Cordelia, as they learn about each other's cultures through <i>language, music, dance and storytelling</i>. All perfect ingredients to make an entertaining and engaging show for the kids.</p>
<h3>The Reason - Why do we want to do this?</h3>
<p>We want to document this to show people how beautiful Africa (Tanzania)  is and why there is so much potential there that cannot be ignored. Hopefully, shedding light on one little corner of the world will inspire people, maybe you, to seek out the other wonders of the globe and appreciate it for what it is.</p>
<p>In the current climate, where division of countries and cultures, and fear of others because of their differences seems to be becoming the norm, this project stands to challenge these notions as we combine our collective experience of life in Britain and Tanzania.   </p>
<p>Through the film we hope that you will be transported to Tanzanian life and join us on our journey of discovery. In addition, this film will help us fund future projects that we hope to take elsewhere and also serve as a resource for others.</p>
<p><br/>We have managed to pay for everything from flights, to accommodation, to travel itself on the road (won't be walking hundreds of miles with a show to put on everyday). However we still have some way to go before we can achieve our goal of recording our endeavours so we can spread the word and in order to take you along on our awesome trip, we need <i>your </i>help. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>""So what do we need specifically? Well, a ton of stuff to be honest; and to keep costs down we are mainly sourcing used equipment.</p>
<p>The most pricey components are the Camera and a lens or two to go with it.</p>
<p>Black Magic Pocket Camera (Around <strong>£700</strong>)</p>
<p>Tokina 11-16mm (Around <strong>£300</strong>) That's only one. We are working on basics here.</p>
<p>But its a start, we also need power (Batteries) to last long days of travelling and away from the mains. <strong>£50-100</strong></p>
<p><i>Storage</i>: Hard Drives and SD cards - there will be a lot of footage from a month of travelling and it all has to go somewhere, with no iCloud we need physical storage space ;) about <strong>£300's </strong>worth.</p>
<p><i>Sound equipment</i>: One of the most crucial aspects of any film. Bad sound equals unwatchable film, its as simple as that. Something along a <i>Rode Video Mic</i> and <i>Tascam recorder</i> <strong>£150-250</strong></p>
<p><i>Accessories</i> - All the little bits that connect everything and allow us to store all this stuff. And that's just a glimpse into the equipment we need. </p>
<p>Camera Cage: <strong>£150</strong></p>
<p>Follow focus: <strong>£50</strong></p>
<p>Camera Stabilisation: <strong>£200</strong></p>
<p>Neutral Density Filter: <strong>£150</strong></p>
<p>The list goes on.</p>
<p>The reason we decided to set the target here is in order to acquire the most vital equipment, ultimately some things we <i>can</i> do without, which in turn will affect what we can create but that's expected. </p>
<p><strong>Rewards: </strong></p>
<p>So what do you get?</p>
<p>Well along with the usual suspects such as a heartfelt thank you on social media, there will be some exclusive rewards that will come directly from Tanzania... even a film premier invitation. </p>
<p>Examples include personalised post cards, with photos taken at various locations such as the schools themselves as we travel from one city to another. (With a personal message to boot) </p>
<p>On top of that there are some mystery gifts that we'll come across as we travel. (Give us a hint in a message and we'll try our best to look for something in that region.) Do you fancy a chance to learn some basic Swahili? Then we have that covered too. </p>
<p>""You may be wondering, 'what happens to all this kit once we have returned and shot the documentary?'"" Well for starters it will be useful for shooting our next adventure in another part of the world. Secondly we will be running a poll with all kinds of small and yet to be established charities and whichever tops the list, we aim to work hand in hand and create a documentary from start to finish free of charge for them. Providing a chance for a good cause to get some much deserved attention. </p>

This is simply not the whole truth. As the father of two young boys, I know more committed black fathers than not who are committed to raising their children. Those fathers are also able to testify the same truth. There are more positive committed black fathers than what is displayed in the media.  </p><p>We need to show our kids <i>the other side</i> of being a black father: the beauty, the connection, and the struggle. We need to show them the value of fatherhood and what it means to us.  It is a process that will be passed to the next generation. But we need to start now. There is no middle ground on this: we must communicate the right image of fatherhood to our community, because nobody else is going to do it for us. </p><p>To change the narrative, Awesome Black Dads is currently working to put together a limited-edition coffee table photo book.

This is simply not the whole truth. As the father of two young boys, I know more committed black fathers than not who are committed to raising their children. Those fathers are also able to testify the same truth. There are more positive committed black fathers than what is displayed in the media.  We need to show our kids the other side of being a black father: the beauty, the connection, and the struggle. We need to show them the value of fatherhood and what it means to us.  It is a process that will be passed to the next generation. But we need to start now. There is no middle ground on this: we must communicate the right image of fatherhood to our community, because nobody else is going to do it for us. To change the narrative, Awesome Black Dads is currently working to put together a limited-edition coffee table photo book. This book will provide an authentic look at contemporary black fathers. Our goal is to provoke positive dialogue within our community that sparks an action to create better images of us using other media platforms.  Mainstream media is filled to the brim with negative portrayals of black fathers, and if we want to leave behind a better legacy that we know and love, we must do so on our own terms.

<h3>Take it from me...</h3>
<p>My name is Frank Vaughn and I am a college graduate.  Finally.  I was raised by a hard-working father who had to sacrifice his dream of being our family's first college graduate when life made him a single father.  Our life was hard as I grew up, and I never considered attempting college until my junior year of high school.  We didn't have the money for me to go and while my standardized test scores indicated future success in academics, my GPA spoke of a lack of ambition.  I decided at the last moment to go anyway, thinking I would figure it out as I went. <br/><br/>I battled personal financial difficulty, adjustment to a life of previously unheard of freedom, marriage and divorce, and two wars around the world.  My refusal to give up--along with a willingness to amass a huge amount of debt--kept me in the game until I finally finished 17 years later.<br/><br/>This campaign is my attempt to pass on the hard lessons of life that I learned on this journey.  My sincere hope is that I can save at least one person the heartache of making the mistakes I did.  College is hard enough, but it's nearly impossible when you can't get out of your own way.<br/><br/>I am grateful to anyone who makes the leap into partnering with me to help college students find a more productive path to realizing their dreams than the one I traveled.</p>

<li>
<strong>Interpreting students: </strong>Learn by doing and feel like an interpreter from the safety of your own home, until you are ready to get into the booth and apply what you've learnt. You'll be able to offset the anxiety so typical of interpreting students with unlimited practice and will benefit from the knowledge of more experienced interpreters and interpreter-trainers.</li>
<li>
<strong>Professors and universities: </strong>Improve your teaching experience by letting technology enter your classroom.<strong> </strong>Send out, receive, and grade assignments, implement virtual rooms for the teaching-and-learning dialogue, foster peer-to-peer cooperation, and monitor your students' progress. This innovative software will compensate for the reduced contact hours and help your interpreting students gain autonomy.</li>
<li>
<strong>Interpreters: </strong>Prepare yourself easily before any conference and be the most well-fitted professional any client could ask for. A cost-effective preparation tool specially suited to enhance the performance of freelance interpreters who offer their services in different fields and have to master a new topic every month.</li>
<li>
<strong>Language learners: </strong>Speak like a native, exposing yourself to real speeches and actively working on them through shadowing and retour interpreting. New language learning techniques for people with advanced skills who have been stuck at a level in which there is no more grammar to learn but still plenty of room for improvement in expression and new vocabulary acquisition. </li>
</ul><h3>Why is interpretame.com different?</h3><p>Interpretame.com is a comprehensive software that allows you to <strong>go through all the steps to train interpreting from beginning to end</strong>:</p><ul>
<li>Finding speeches</li>
<li>Recording yourself while interpreting them</li>
<li>Listening to your performance</li>
<li>Filling-in self-assessment sheets</li>
<li>Grading yourself</li>
<li>Asking other users for feedback</li>
<li>Creating glossaries</li>
<li>Memorizing new vocabulary</li>
<li>Testing your new knowledge</li>
<li>Sharing resources</li>
<li>Discussing interesting topics with your peers</li>
<li>Improving interpreting-related skills such as mental readiness, bidirectionality, context inference, rewording or improvisation.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, <u>it uses <strong>gamification</strong></u>  as a powerful mean of making the learning process fun</p><ul>
<li>Challenge users to impossible speeches</li>
<li>Accept challenges and prove your skills</li>
<li>Share memory games</li>
</ul><p>​<strong>You will not need any other resource</strong>.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494834026/fnp62wotn9j2pttmnwld.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Being a user-centered platform, it makes possible for every person to design their own exercises, and choose topics to prepare, as well as the mode in which to do so. In addition, it allows you to choose between going through the <strong>entire process independently </strong>and keeping your files private, <strong>or relying on peer-assessment</strong> and share your files with them. </p><p>Other platforms provide downloadable activities and offer general guidelines, which means limited resources and the risk of getting out of date if the owners don't add new activities regularly. Contrary to that, in interpretame.com you will not find prepared activities to fill in, print or solve — you'll be given a tool to <strong>customize your own interpreting training</strong> that suits your needs, plus a community of peers to support you through the whole process. </p><p>On top of that, it is a tool for the interpreting classroom that can be used by professors and universities to monitor their students' progress by granted administration rights.</p><ul></ul><h3>How does it work?</h3><div>
<p>If you are a university, academy or professor who wants to use interpretame.com as an interpreter-trainer or entity, our Campus account will grant you administration rights over a given number of students' accounts, which you'll be able to monitor, edit and delete, and whose work you'll be able to grade through a private grading system. You'll also get room to add private sections not visible to other users or entities.</p>
<p>If you're a student or an interpreter, simply register at interpretame.com. You can do that already and get instant access to your customizable profile, your private storage space, and a public forum with different rooms.</p>
<p>Your private profile contains different sections that will guide you through the whole training: from obtaining a speech, to recording your interpretation, assessing it, or sharing it. Interpretations stored by users are called <strong>Prets</strong> — we encourage you to go to our site right now and create your first one to get a taste of the platform. How? Since an image speaks a thousand words, we'd like to invite you to <strong>check the following short video-tutorial</strong>:</p>

<p>The video-tutorial depicts the beta version, which is already available and functional, but is only a sample of Interprétame's potential — <strong>with your help, we can take it to a whole new level</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p>We'll be able to host thousands of users, offer unlimited storage space, make it available in other languages, implement the feedback function, adapt it for professors and universities, develop a mobile app and desktop application that will allow you to train offline and improve all the sections to make a good product amazing. </p>

</div><h2>From idea to reality </h2><h3>The origin of a dream </h3><p>Interprétame was born from the needs of a student trying to make it through her interpreting exams at university. <strong>Insufficient and too scattered resources </strong>made self-training a rather complex process depending on many external factors. That student was me, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/alba-collado-cascales-775bbb67"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Alba Collado</a>, and, like many Interpreting students, I had to juggle speech-providing platforms, with a recorder, printed self-evaluation sheets copied from a book, excel/word-created glossaries, and the availability of other people in order to assess myself and test my recently learnt vocabulary. How would it be possible to go through this process independently? <strong>Why wasn’t there an easy-to-use application available, </strong>that would allow all of the aforementioned factors to be united in an all-in-one platform?</p><p>This question frustrated me throughout my studies, and while I was writing my final thesis <strong>I set my mind to design such a tool</strong>. My tutor loved the idea, yet she thought it was too big a project for a graduate paper, so she advised me to keep it and see if in the future I wanted to make it my PhD thesis. Those were my initial steps in the formation of my idea.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493560911/zzkqqulmrotdlofsf97u.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>I put my sketches in a drawer, graduated and jumped into the working world.</p><p>Some years later, while living in Hamburg (Germany), I shared an apartment with a brilliant Computer Engineer with whom I quickly became friends. One night, talking about our dreams and aspirations and how we imagined our future, I shared with him this vision of a self-learning platform for interpreters and how I wished I could implement it someday, and to my surprise, he took a great interest in the idea.

You can visit it at https://www.interpretame.com. Who is interpretame.com for?

Interpreting students: Learn by doing and feel like an interpreter from the safety of your own home, until you are ready to get into the booth and apply what you've learnt. You'll be able to offset the anxiety so typical of interpreting students with unlimited practice and will benefit from the knowledge of more experienced interpreters and interpreter-trainers.

Professors and universities: Improve your teaching experience by letting technology enter your classroom. Send out, receive, and grade assignments, implement virtual rooms for the teaching-and-learning dialogue, foster peer-to-peer cooperation, and monitor your students' progress. This innovative software will compensate for the reduced contact hours and help your interpreting students gain autonomy.

Interpreters: Prepare yourself easily before any conference and be the most well-fitted professional any client could ask for. A cost-effective preparation tool specially suited to enhance the performance of freelance interpreters who offer their services in different fields and have to master a new topic every month.

Language learners: Speak like a native, exposing yourself to real speeches and actively working on them through shadowing and retour interpreting. New language learning techniques for people with advanced skills who have been stuck at a level in which there is no more grammar to learn but still plenty of room for improvement in expression and new vocabulary acquisition. 
Why is interpretame.com different?Interpretame.com is a comprehensive software that allows you to go through all the steps to train interpreting from beginning to end:
Finding speeches
Recording yourself while interpreting them
Listening to your performance
Filling-in self-assessment sheets
Grading yourself
Asking other users for feedback
Creating glossaries
Memorizing new vocabulary
Testing your new knowledge
Sharing resources
Discussing interesting topics with your peers
Improving interpreting-related skills such as mental readiness, bidirectionality, context inference, rewording or improvisation.
In addition, it uses gamification  as a powerful mean of making the learning process fun
Challenge users to impossible speeches
Accept challenges and prove your skills
Share memory games
​You will not need any other resource.Being a user-centered platform, it makes possible for every person to design their own exercises, and choose topics to prepare, as well as the mode in which to do so. In addition, it allows you to choose between going through the entire process independently and keeping your files private, or relying on peer-assessment and share your files with them. Other platforms provide downloadable activities and offer general guidelines, which means limited resources and the risk of getting out of date if the owners don't add new activities regularly. Contrary to that, in interpretame.com you will not find prepared activities to fill in, print or solve — you'll be given a tool to customize your own interpreting training that suits your needs, plus a community of peers to support you through the whole process. On top of that, it is a tool for the interpreting classroom that can be used by professors and universities to monitor their students' progress by granted administration rights.How does it work?
If you are a university, academy or professor who wants to use interpretame.com as an interpreter-trainer or entity, our Campus account will grant you administration rights over a given number of students' accounts, which you'll be able to monitor, edit and delete, and whose work you'll be able to grade through a private grading system. You'll also get room to add private sections not visible to other users or entities.
If you're a student or an interpreter, simply register at interpretame.com. You can do that already and get instant access to your customizable profile, your private storage space, and a public forum with different rooms.
Your private profile contains different sections that will guide you through the whole training: from obtaining a speech, to recording your interpretation, assessing it, or sharing it. Interpretations stored by users are called Prets — we encourage you to go to our site right now and create your first one to get a taste of the platform. How? Since an image speaks a thousand words, we'd like to invite you to check the following short video-tutorial:



The video-tutorial depicts the beta version, which is already available and functional, but is only a sample of Interprétame's potential — with your help, we can take it to a whole new level.

We'll be able to host thousands of users, offer unlimited storage space, make it available in other languages, implement the feedback function, adapt it for professors and universities, develop a mobile app and desktop application that will allow you to train offline and improve all the sections to make a good product amazing. 
Types of accounts
When interpretame.com is fully ready, it will offer three kinds of membership. 



Basic account: It is free and allows you to store up to 30 minutes of audio, split into up to three Prets, which can be reused by deleting old audio and freeing storage space. It allows you to send one feedback request per month. One personal glossary with as many terms as needed. 

Premium account: For only 7.99 euros per month, you'll be able to store unlimited minutes of audio in an unlimited number of Prets, up to 25 GB. You'll be able to send unlimited feedback requests. You'll have the possibility to sort glossaries according to both topic and language and have the testing software examine you accordingly, plus you'll have the possibility to share glossaries and download them in Excel. 

Campus account: We offer a special package for universities, academies, professors and libraries that will grant administration rights over student accounts. Specially designed to improve the teaching experience, this tool allows for the sending of assignments and the tracking of students' progress. It offers the possibility to add private channels in the forum. Cooperative glossaries can be accessed, modified and downloaded by a group.Storage space and pricing will vary according to the number of student accounts linked to the master account.



Our campaign
What do we need and what is in it for you?
We've adjusted our costs and have calculated that with only 8,000 euros (8,700 USD) we can utilize more powerful servers to host a greater number of users, and offer unlimited space. In addition, we'll be able to implement an accounts system to suit your needs, develop a Campus account for universities and professors to monitor their student's progress, eventually making the platform available in other languages (starting with English). Lastly, we'll develop the desktop and mobile app, and implement all planned extra functions.
What will your help make possible?

More powerful servers > Unlimited users, unlimited storage space.
Internal net and evaluation system > Feedback function.
Desktop application > Continue your training even offline.
Mobile app development > Use your commuting time to train. 
App rights > Acquisition of Apple and Android licenses for phone app.
Website translation > Make it international (first English and later on other languages).
Campus account > Improve your teaching experience and monitor your students.
Improvement of existing sections > Download and share your glossaries, and more.
New sections > See new sections such as Challenges come to live.

 
From idea to reality The origin of a dream Interprétame was born from the needs of a student trying to make it through her interpreting exams at university. Insufficient and too scattered resources made self-training a rather complex process depending on many external factors. That student was me, Alba Collado, and, like many Interpreting students, I had to juggle speech-providing platforms, with a recorder, printed self-evaluation sheets copied from a book, excel/word-created glossaries, and the availability of other people in order to assess myself and test my recently learnt vocabulary. How would it be possible to go through this process independently? Why wasn’t there an easy-to-use application available, that would allow all of the aforementioned factors to be united in an all-in-one platform?This question frustrated me throughout my studies, and while I was writing my final thesis I set my mind to design such a tool. My tutor loved the idea, yet she thought it was too big a project for a graduate paper, so she advised me to keep it and see if in the future I wanted to make it my PhD thesis. Those were my initial steps in the formation of my idea.I put my sketches in a drawer, graduated and jumped into the working world.Some years later, while living in Hamburg (Germany), I shared an apartment with a brilliant Computer Engineer with whom I quickly became friends. One night, talking about our dreams and aspirations and how we imagined our future, I shared with him this vision of a self-learning platform for interpreters and how I wished I could implement it someday, and to my surprise, he took a great interest in the idea. He encouraged me to pursue this dream, and not only offered to build it, but also added some great ideas to make it more attractive through gamification. I though at the time that it was just talk between roommates, but a week later we were checking if there was something similar to this on the market, one month later we had acquired interpretame.com and stepped into the exciting path that brought us here today. My partner is Marco Antonio Pajares, with whom I have been working with for the last two years.Our journeyFor the past two years, we have had to combine our jobs with the developement of our dream, so we have been working slowly but steady.We have two very different minds that complement each other perfectly. Moreover, we learnt a lot from fields unknown to us before, and along the way, we encountered wonderful people that with their little gestures helped us make big steps.Creative souls that helped us take professional pictures for the website and banners, and designed exclusive T-shirts for interpretame.com; skilled minds that helped us improve the quality of our videos; great advisers we turned to for a fresh perspective; volunteers who tested new functions and gave us feedback, enthusiastic friends who believed in us and encouraged us pursue our dream.

<h2><strong>We are Nature's Way Montessori School</strong></h2>
<p>Our well-used and well-loved wooden playground structure has come to an end after serving kids ages 2 - 13 for thirty years.  We are in need of a new, safe play structure that will last another thirty. The placement of this structure will be within a wooded area filled with cedar trees and imagination. </p>
<p>We have numerous volunteers who will be installing our new play structure, with the goal of having the new play structure installed before the school year ends on May 23rd. Funds have already been raised from bake sales, cookie dough sales, homemade wildlife t-shirts, and parent donations to pay for the delivery of the materials. </p>
<h2><strong>The Design</strong></h2>
<p>The Upper Elementary students were given the task of creating a map of the current playground.  Based on the map the students created their ""dream playground."" This project included measuring and surveying and a lot of collaboration.  Students also interviewed current staff and students in order to initiate memories of play spaces, and asked them to visualize the play space they desired. The end result was a series of thoughts and feelings they had during play, childhood memories growing up on our current play structure, and pictures that span the last thirty years.  These memories will be incorporated into our new play structure.</p>
<h2><strong>The Details</strong></h2>
<p>The total amount needed to purchase the new play structure is $16,000.  The delivery cost of $2,500 has already been raised through smaller school-wide fundraisers.</p>

<h3>What &amp; Why</h3>
<p>I have been playing violin since I was 11. I always dreamed of becoming a performer. I went through 2 music degrees and countless festivals and teacher training seminars. I always knew that I wouldn't make money as a musician but I was passionate enough about performing that it felt worthwhile to me. When I got out, I realized that performing was only a small part of my daily life. I wanted a career where I would be respected and financially stable, while still doing something creative.</p>
<p>In October of last year I started to teach myself how to code. I already had some background with HTML/CSS so I worked on learning C, Javascript, and React. I was totally hooked and spent every morning practicing and coming up with projects. You can see what I've been up to here: <a href=""http://www.kaitlinmoreno.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.kaitlinmoreno.com</a></p>
<p>My goal was to apply for a coding bootcamp that could bring me to the next level and prepare me for real job interviews. Many of them are not very hard to get into, and only require that you show interest and have the cash to back it up (usually around 10-20k.) As a musician, I knew that I wouldn't be able to pay this kind of tuition up front while not working. </p>
<p>I started to look for programs that were more competitive and offered deferred tuition. That's when I found <a href=""http://www.gracehopper.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Grace Hopper</a>. This bootcamp is part of <a href=""https://www.fullstackacademy.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fullstack Academy</a> and was created with the goal of eliminating the disparity of women in technology by providing a debt-free system. <strong>Students pay for their education only after receiving employment. </strong></p>
<p>The application process was <a href=""https://www.fullstackacademy.com/blog/how-to-ace-the-fullstack-academy-interview"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">pretty rigorous</a>. I had to complete essays, take a coding exam, and go through a 2-part technical interview. I studied every day for months, went to meetups, and met tons of other code newbies online that gave me advice and helped me through the process. In March 2017 I found out that I was accepted!</p>
<p>Grace Hopper is a 13 week course (10 hours a day, 6 days a week) and provides<strong> extensive job search assistance</strong>. The program culminates in hiring day, <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>where employers will see the projects I've been working on and I can connect one-on-one with companies. They have a large</span><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> network of </span>tech-entrepreneurs<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> and startup leaders that will meet with graduates looking for their next career move. There is a dedicated placement team who will help improve my resume and online presence, prep for interviews, and connect with the right person inside companies I am interested in applying to.</span></p>

I started to look for programs that were more competitive and offered deferred tuition. That's when I found Grace Hopper. This bootcamp is part of Fullstack Academy and was created with the goal of eliminating the disparity of women in technology by providing a debt-free system. Students pay for their education only after receiving employment. 
The application process was pretty rigorous. I had to complete essays, take a coding exam, and go through a 2-part technical interview. I studied every day for months, went to meetups, and met tons of other code newbies online that gave me advice and helped me through the process. In March 2017 I found out that I was accepted!
Grace Hopper is a 13 week course (10 hours a day, 6 days a week) and provides extensive job search assistance. The program culminates in hiring day, where employers will see the projects I've been working on and I can connect one-on-one with companies. They have a large network of tech-entrepreneurs and startup leaders that will meet with graduates looking for their next career move. There is a dedicated placement team who will help improve my resume and online presence, prep for interviews, and connect with the right person inside companies I am interested in applying to.

What I Need & What You Get
This fund is for my living costs. I have saved enough for rent, but I'll need help with food/necessities/transportation in the city. It breaks down like this:


$2275 = $25/day groceries x 91 days

$363 = $121/month metro pass x 3 months

$362 = Help subsidize the rent I still have to pay back home in DC


I want to work for this. So I'm offering a couple of cool things:


$25 One logo design for your site

$50 A mini photoshoot at my location in Petworth. One person, 30min, 5 photos. Perfect for headshots.

$75 Logo design with 3 options. You get 1 edit.

$100 A single page responsive website. You send me all your material and I'll put it together.

$150 A 1 hr photo session, any location, up to 2 people, 15 photos.

$250 A 2 hr photo session, any location, up to 6 people, 50 photos. Great for family shoots.

<p>We have worked incredibly hard for the past seven years to build something thousands of people are very proud of - something widely considered to be the best in the world.  We are asking for your help because we have exceeded our ability to support our students' phenomenal growth.</p>
<p>Every year we host representatives from art schools across the globe who fly in from countries such as Hong Kong, Scotland, France and the USA to recruit our students.  Reps and students engage in meaningful conversations that can last an hour, during which the work is critiqued and relationships are formed that assist throughout the application process.  Our students will apply to as many as 20 schools in their pursuit of the best opportunities.   </p>
<p>Portfolio Day at ESA is the culmination of years of focused effort.  PD7 included 110 representatives from 64 post-secondary schools and programs from 3 continents and 5 countries, and resulted in millions of dollars in scholarship offers.  PD8 is even larger.  In 2014 we had 55 participating students, in 2015 we had 71 students involved, in 2016 we had 75 student participants, and this year we have more than 85 students in PD8.  As prices of materials rise and more people flock to the school to exceed their potential, we struggle to meet demand as our budgets do not increase.  In order to make PD8 function we need your help.</p>
<p>We are planning to raise at least $25000 with this campaign.  With that money we will be able to pay for the extraordinary work under way by our grade 12's, and support the much larger group of grade 11 students already planning for PD9, which should see 95 participants with between 25 and 50 works each.  That means we will pay for and exhibit 2500+ pieces in a show that lasts for one day.  Some things are inexpensive to make and others require outside assistance.  At even a low estimate of $50 per work we are running into amounts far surpassing what we seek through this project. </p>
<p>One reason for making such large and elaborate art works is the direct translation to scholarships and artistic opportunities.  Even with the most significant offers, most of our grade 12 students are unable to afford attending international programs, and so we do everything we can to secure the funding required for their dreams to come true.  In the 7 years of Portfolio Day at ESA we have received approximately twenty five million dollars in total scholarship offers, none of which, unfortunately, is given to the program.</p>
<p>By taking on responsibility for all of these futures we are also helping to shape aspects of our future world.  PD7 reached a level of complexity and scale that exceeded our limits.  With PD8 larger in every way, and PD9 larger again, with an almost doubling of the number of participants in just a few years, we are accepting a responsibility that will require the support of a much larger community - one in which you can play a valuable role.</p>
<p>All of the money raised will go to support our kids in PD8 and PD9.  Your contribution will allow us to re-imagine what is possible by teenagers in high school.  We hope you will attend PD8 when it opens to the public at 7pm on Friday November 3rd, 2017.</p>

<p>Comunidad educativa <strong>Tamujé Iwigara (significado: nuestro aliento de vida)</strong>, es un proyecto intercultural que hemos venido construyendo distintas familias y personas que han colaborado comprometidas con la educación, y con hacer de Tarahumara un lugar de buen vivir. En él, ofrecemos educación de nivel prescolar y primaria a 32 niñ@s de la Sierra.<br/><br/>El sostenimiento económico del proyecto se lleva a cabo mediante la cooperación mensual de los padres de familia, que van desde los $50 pesos hasta los $1,300 pesos (según sus posibilidades), becas de particulares, eventos realizados por los padres de familias y equipo de trabajo, venta de calendarios del proyecto de arte Tamujé, entre otros donativos eventuales. <br/><br/>El costo mensual real por niño es de $3,000 pesos, pero la situación de las familias, tanto Rarámuri como mestizas, es muy limitada en su mayoría.<br/><br/>Nuestra necesidad más sentida por el momento es conseguir <strong>10 becas mensuales de $3,000 pesos para cada mes</strong>.  Esto, para nuestros niños rarámuri y mestizos de bajos recursos.   </p>
<p>Este dinero va destinado a varios rubros; Materiales utilizados día a día para realizar actividades creativas y dinámicas, para una mayor comprensión de los temas. De igual manera también se reparte para gastos fijos mensuales de agua, luz e internet dentro de nuestras instalaciones. También gastos que nos demanda nuestra granjita, donde contamos con animales como conejos, gallinas, borregos y puerquitos. Por último pero igual de importante, se destina para las salidas que organizamos al aire libre, así los niños tienen contacto con la naturaleza que los rodea y aprenden sobre ella.<br/><br/><i><u>Los que más estarán agradecidos serán nuestros niñ@s, al saber que más personas se interesan por seguir con la educación que responda al complejo entorno de la Tarahumara. </u></i><br/><br/><i>Gracias a sus donaciones, seguiremos construyendo procesos de aprendizaje, que no sólo incrementen los conocimientos requeridos, sino que permitan generar un tejido comunitario, social, pacífico y digno, que produzca relaciones armónicas con el territorio y con todos los seres que en él habitan. Así asumiremos la diversidad cultural como un factor excelente de complementariedad y riqueza humana.</i></p>

De igual manera también se reparte para gastos fijos mensuales de agua, luz e internet dentro de nuestras instalaciones. También gastos que nos demanda nuestra granjita, donde contamos con animales como conejos, gallinas, borregos y puerquitos. Por último pero igual de importante, se destina para las salidas que organizamos al aire libre, así los niños tienen contacto con la naturaleza que los rodea y aprenden sobre ella.Los que más estarán agradecidos serán nuestros niñ@s, al saber que más personas se interesan por seguir con la educación que responda al complejo entorno de la Tarahumara. Gracias a sus donaciones, seguiremos construyendo procesos de aprendizaje, que no sólo incrementen los conocimientos requeridos, sino que permitan generar un tejido comunitario, social, pacífico y digno, que produzca relaciones armónicas con el territorio y con todos los seres que en él habitan. Así asumiremos la diversidad cultural como un factor excelente de complementariedad y riqueza humana.
Hay muchas formas de ayudar:

<p>Whereas we crave to give the upcoming generation a better future and thus strongly believe the way to it needs better mindsets.

<p>Consequently, in order to achieve this ultimate goal, we started providing programs that are based on STEM educational system where we teach them research skills and creative thinking.

<p>We are working on 4th, 9th, 16th, and 17th goals of the SDGs.  In this way, we build a future where there are much fewer problems and more opportunities for everyone. A future, with diversity without racism. A future where we see our students the scientists of tomorrow with creative minds building a green future.</p>
<p>Between 2012 and 2018,</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>The Shular Institute</strong> is the first of its kind in the post-secondary education field. It is a community-based hospitality institute, developed to redefine the purpose of foodservice and business management through our modern global curriculum and diverse local sustainable culture. <i><strong>Founded by the first African-American Certified Master Chef  in the world, Daryl L. Shular, </strong></i>the Institute will deliver top-tier programming made for <i>“The Modern Entrepreneur Chef and Hospitality Professional.</i>""</p>
<p>Our institute's mission is to develop future culinary industry leaders, through the unique integration of entrepreneurship and advanced modern culinary principles of education. Our students will receive the training, skills, and certifications needed to become gainfully employed and eventually leaders in the culinary industry at the fraction of the cost of a four-year college.</p>
<p>Our staff and unique offerings differentiate us from other culinary institutions. Our president, Daryl L. Shular is one of 68 <i>Certified Master Chefs</i> in the world and has earned over 200 awards and accomplishments. Chef Shular is passionate about creating the next leaders in the culinary and hospitality industry. Shular met his business partner and current vice president Sean Rush, a former marketing director with Le Cordon Bleu Colleges, seven years ago. They instantly recognized their shared passion for advancing culinary arts education. Together, they are building a top-tier, student-oriented program that will provide marketable skills to future generations.  </p>
<p>The financial burden of higher learning is daunting and students talented and passionate about culinary studies are often unable to pursue their dreams due to tuition costs.  At the same time, African-American businesses continue to be challenged with securing the critical funds meant to bridge the gap needed to start or scale operations.  Our goal of opening our school in the Fall of 2020 has been postponed until early 2021 as Covid-19 has greatly impacted our timeline. With your help, we can build a sustainable business while eliminating the financial obstacle for our most dedicated and talented future chefs and hospitality professionals.  </p>

<h3>What We Did and What's Next</h3>
<p><strong>The Shular Institute</strong> has accomplished thus far:</p>
<p>We have secured a 7,100 square foot restaurant property in Metro Atlanta. We have invested in facility upgrades and stocked the kitchen 80% with stoves, freezers, refrigeration, pots, pans, and small wares. </p>
<p>We are still in need of funds for the remaining projects and builds needed to be ready to open our doors to the students.  Below are the following ways that we will utilize the funds raised: <br/><br/><strong>Tuition Reduction Fund: $200,000 </strong></p>

The concept of Emotional Intelligence was defined for the first time in 1990 by Mayer and Salovey. These authors defined emotional intelligence as ""the ability to monitor the feelings and emotions of oneself and others, to discriminate between them and to use this information for the orientation of their own action and thinking."" Years later, in 1995, Daniel Goleman published his first book, named ""Emotional Intelligence,"" pointing out the urgent need <br/>of introducing into the schools, an emotional learning that is basic for everything that the present and future life of children entails. Since then multiple studies have shown that there is a clear relationship between Emotional Intelligence and mental health. It can be proven, then, that greater Emotional Intelligence leads to larger emotional well-being and produces better Mental Health.</font></font></p>

Nevertheless, an investigation carried out in Europe, Asia and United States, with the implication of 121 organizations and the evaluation of millions of workers, offered a result that should make us think: 23% of professional success is due to our intellectual capacities and in 77% to our emotional skills.

<p><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;""><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;"">If we review the UNESCO Report of the International Commission on Education for the 21st Century (Delors, et al. 1996) we can read that the New Education that must face the 21st century should focus around four basic axes, which are defined as The four pillars of education:<br/>1) Learning to know and learning to learn,  to take advantage of the possibilities offered by education throughout life.<br/>2) Learning to do to empower the person to handle diverse situations.<br/><br/><br/>Traditional Education has always prioritized the first two axes and it is time now to expand the focus also to the last two axes, giving them the relevance they deserve, which undoubtedly leads us back to give importance to the emotional intelligence learning. We should take into account that emotions are not only important pillars in the personal and social sphere, as many studies have already shown the influence of emotions in any learning, which also determines their involvement in the first two pillars.</font></font><br/> </p>

We base Education in schools, institutes and universities in promoting the future professional success of children, adolescents and youth. Nevertheless, an investigation carried out in Europe, Asia and United States, with the implication of 121 organizations and the evaluation of millions of workers, offered a result that should make us think: 23% of professional success is due to our intellectual capacities and in 77% to our emotional skills. The research was endorsed by The Consortium for Research on Emotional Intelligence in Organizations, a consortium created by Daniel Goleman.

If we review the UNESCO Report of the International Commission on Education for the 21st Century (Delors, et al. 1996) we can read that the New Education that must face the 21st century should focus around four basic axes, which are defined as The four pillars of education:1) Learning to know and learning to learn,  to take advantage of the possibilities offered by education throughout life.2) Learning to do to empower the person to handle diverse situations.Traditional Education has always prioritized the first two axes and it is time now to expand the focus also to the last two axes, giving them the relevance they deserve, which undoubtedly leads us back to give importance to the emotional intelligence learning. We should take into account that emotions are not only important pillars in the personal and social sphere, as many studies have already shown the influence of emotions in any learning, which also determines their involvement in the first two pillars. 
With everything previously mentioned and so much more that we could read on this matter, don’t you think that it is really necessary to educate on Emotional Intelligence along all educational stages to facilitate a good development? And then, if emotional intelligence learning is so important in the professional environment, will it not be equally or more important in the personal, family and social life areas?

<p><strong>Create:</strong> Use the newly learned concepts to create completely new shapes and patterns. You can create shapes, animations, small games or program notifications - all from the Python coding environment in the imagiLabs app. Once done, you check whether your code is correct and learn to debug just like professional programmers do. Save your creations to come back to them later. Once the Python syntax is mastered, there is no wrong way to use it. The same shape can be programmed in many ways, it’s just a matter of how many programming tricks you want to use!</p>

Meanwhile, our team will get to work and bring imagiCharm to life!</p></div>","imagiCharm is a colorful accessory designed for girls to customize directly from their mobile phones using programming.   While imagiCharm has been designed for girls between 12 and 16 years, it can be enjoyed by anyone who wants to explore their creativity through programming and join our revolution of girls shaping the future with technology.   Our story has been covered already by amazing people at Samsung Next, DI Digital, Breakit, Red Bull & many more! Even Tim Cook tweeted about us!  PARENTS: Coding as a way to continue creatingSara is an awesome mom from Stockholm who encouraged her daughter Linn to attend our beginner coding workshop where we tested our imagiCharm prototypes and app curriculum. Now a big fan and reoccurring workshop attendee, Linn is learning how to become a coding pro and loves programming fun projects with her friends.   EDUCATORS: Bridging the gap between education and technologyAnurag works with bridging the gap between education and technology at Stockholm International School where he helps to design and facilitate technology initiatives within the curriculums. His students participated in a coding workshop with the imagiLabs team and were able to explore the imagiLabs app and imagiCharm during the prototype phase. Now becoming a reality, imagiCharm is a great product for all students to tangibly see the results of their code and express themselves creatively.     So many colors. imagiCharm has 64 LED lights that can be programmed to light up in any color. It can take on new designs and shapes every day – even multiple times a day.  So many ways to attach it. The imagiCharm is white to ensure a perfect contrast with any pattern or shape you may program. Its attachment comes in different colors and you can make your own attachments, too.  So many different ways to wear it. Girls can wear imagiCharm on their backpacks, tote bags, purses or jackets. They can hang it on their keys, wear as a necklace, headband, and even earrings. It's an all-in-one accessory that’s different every day.   Even your pet will love it.   imagiCharm uses Bluetooth so you can program it at home or on the go. No cables or previous programming experience are needed. The best part is that you do it all from your phone.  The imagiLabs app comes with basic tutorials to help you turn individual LED lights on, change their color, and even turn on multiple lights at the same time using loops. It’s a bit like learning how to put Lego blocks together. Once you know how they work, you’re ready to get creative with your own 8x8 grid.   Anything is possible. If you can dream it, you can code it – because the opportunities with code are endless. Match your imagiCharm with your outfit.Code an emoji to express how you feel. Program an animation.Or even a game. 
 

 
Learn: From beginner to advanced lessons, you will learn how to program in Python and receive instant feedback as the imagiCharm lights up with your newly learned code. Gamified and fun, you unlock new levels as you learn smart ways to use programming to create cool and complex designs.
 

 
Create: Use the newly learned concepts to create completely new shapes and patterns. You can create shapes, animations, small games or program notifications - all from the Python coding environment in the imagiLabs app. Once done, you check whether your code is correct and learn to debug just like professional programmers do. Save your creations to come back to them later. Once the Python syntax is mastered, there is no wrong way to use it. The same shape can be programmed in many ways, it’s just a matter of how many programming tricks you want to use!

 
Explore: Meet other girls who share your interest in technology and showcase your creations within our community. You can like, comment, tag, and even try out each other’s code! Community + collaboration = no sticky bug situations. Help each other code more complex creations and brainstorm crazy ideas together. 
 
 Everything you need to become part of the creative coding revolution!The imagiCharm comes with: 
an attachment
a charging cable
an instructions card 
All in a box full of love from the imagiLabs team. 
The learning content: 
Brain teasers, games, and coding challenges.
Individualised support from our team and the community if you get stuck.
 imagiCharm device compatibilityThe imagiCharm utilizes the imagiLabs application. The app works on mobile phones and tablets that run on the iOS or Android platform. The application is not compatible with Windows, Chrome or Kindle. Specific operating systems and device requirements are as follows:iOS
iOS devices must have OS version 11.0 or higher. In other words, you must have one of the following compatible devices:
iPhone 5s+
iPad Pro 
iPad Air
iPad 5th generation+
iPad mini 2+
You can find a full list of compatible iPhone and iPad devices here and read more about how to identify your iPhone or iPad model.AndroidAndroid devices, while having OS 5.0 or higher, must have all of the following hardware in order to use the imagiLabs application: 
Bluetooth LE (4.0)
Distinct multi-touch touchscreen
WiFi capabilities
   We adopted a user-centered approach right from the start. imagiCharm started as a participatory design research project at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. We wanted to work together with girls to co-create the ultimate gadgets that they would want to use to learn programming.    We learned four key things about teenage girls:
They love self-expression and customization
Tangible experiences are important to them 
Community is everything 
They prefer phones over computers 
   We created prototypes for the imagiCharm and the app and in the process tested them with more than 200 girls. We used the results to further develop and create our final version of the imagiCharm.   If we want to solve this problem then we have to go to its root. There are tools for kids and for adults, but nothing just for teenage girls. Teenage girls want something relevant to their daily lives.We are here to create that.Call it the new tamagotchi or Lego of the “Snapchat generation”, the imagiCharm will change how society thinks about girls and women in tech. We are creating more than just an accessory. We are creating a movement of girls who want to shape the future of tech and change the world!   Expressing yourself creatively through codePreviously a primary school teacher, Paul Landers is now Head of Strategic Partnerships for Connect to Learn at Ericsson. Connect to Learn is a public-private partnership with the purpose to increase access to quality education, especially for girls, through life skills programs and the integration of technology tools and digital learning resources in schools. Our collaboration with Ericsson began during our incubation period at Ericsson ONE where we identified the opportunity for us to collaborate through our Creative Coding Module which is set to be offered by Ericsson's Connect to learn program globally in 2020.     Currency, Taxes, and CustomsConversions to USD shown for pledges, goals, stretch goals are approximate and not final.

</p><p>It is believed that over 20% of the population of Cambodia was killed by the Khmer Rouge during the Pol Pot genocide, between 1975 and 1979.

and

This is the reason why Poeuy Tiht and his wife, a villager of Bakong who had the chance to learn English as a teenager, decided to start a school in February 2014. The school, a non-profit organization, now provides a secure and happy environment for the children to learn. It offers free education to around two hundred impoverished children
and young adults of the village community, many of whom are not able to attend Khmer
school otherwise, because their families cannot afford the costs. <br/></p>This project started around a year ago. Now it is necessary to think long-term. Because the future of this rural school will influence the future of the students.<br/><p><br/></p><h2>What is happening ?<br/>
</h2><h3><b><span>Teaching</span></b></h3><p><span>It can be a challenging job, <span>especially with a constantly changing team. Basically
Poeuy, the director and founder</span></span> of the school, and his wife
are running this whole project by themselves, at times supported by volunteers,
at times not. And this is a heavy job.This is the reason why he needs the support of volunteers and, even better, of a local teacher who could teach daily at the school and be the link between the volunteers.<br/></p><p><i><b>It would cost $500 to buy enough teaching supplies and resources for the Khmer and volunteer teachers, and  $1000 to pay a local teacher for at least the first year.</b></i><br/></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<h3>Learning</h3>
<ul><li>English is essential for these children if they want to have job opportunities in their country today. At the moment there are seven classes during the day : two 2-hours classes in the morning, two 2-hours classes in the afternoon, one 1-hour class in the late afternoon, and two 1-hour evening classes.

 Poeuy, with the help of local workers,
started to build two classrooms. The students now have a concrete 
school,

Beaucoup d'entre eux ont perdu leurs pères dans l'armée. Dans les villages, les conditions de vie sont aujourd'hui encore précaires, et nombreuses sont les mères qui ne peuvent pas allaiter leurs nouveaux-nés, et sont <br/>contraintes de les nourrir avec de l'eau de riz.<br/> <br/>Le Cambodge aujourd'hui est très dépendant du tourisme, qui donne aux jeunes cambodgiens un grand nombre d'opportunités d'emplois. Pour avoir accès à une carrière dans le tourisme, savoir parler anglais et utiliser un ordinateur est nécessaire. Et si les villes principales sont pourvues d'écoles de qualité, beaucoup d'écoles rurales n'ont pas la chance d'être équipées du matériel nécessaire à un apprentissage complet. <br/> <br/>Nous considérons que les enfants issus de zone rurales ne devraient pas être lésés en matière d'éducation, c'est pourquoi nous avons ouvert une école en février 2014 dans une zone rurale, proche de Siem Reap et des temples d'Angkor.  L'école, une <br/>organisation non-gouvernementale, apporte aux enfants un environnement d'étude agréable et sûr. Nous donnons accès à des cours d'anglais gratuits à près de deux cent enfants et jeunes adultes de la communauté, qui souvent ne peuvent pas aller à l'école khmer par manque d'argent.<br/> <br/>Ce projet a débuté il y a environ un an et nous nous sommes concentrés jusqu'ici sur les cours au quotidien. Mais notre volonté est désormais d'avoir une vision à long terme et de s'engager pour l'avenir, car du futur de notre école dépend le futur de nos jeunes élèves.<br/> <br/></p><h2>Nos actions</h2><p> <br/></p><h3>Enseigner</h3><p> <br/>L'enseignement peut-être une activité difficile, d'autant plus dans une équipe aussi changeante. Poeuy, le directeur et créateur du projet, aidé de sa femme, dirige seul l'ONG, épaulé parfois par des volontaires internationaux venus donné des cours d'anglais, parfois complètement seul. Une tâche qui représente une importante charge de travail.<br/> </p><p>Poeuy fait appel à des volontaires internationaux qui assistent ou organisent les cours d'anglais. Pour une meilleure organisation des cours et un meilleur suivi des élèves, le professeur a besoin de matériel éducatif, de manuels et de méthodes. <br/></p><p><i>Acheter des manuels et du matériel éducatif pour les enseignants : 500 $</i></p><p><i>Payer un enseignement cambodgien pour assurer un suivant permanent des élèves et faire le lien entre volontaires durant un an : 1000 $<br/> </i><br/></p><h3>Apprendre</h3><p> <br/>L'anglais est une langue capitale pour ces enfants s'ils veulent s'ouvrir à plus d'opportunités d'emploi dans leur pays. Les élèves, âgés de 4 ans pour les plus jeunes débutants, à 22 ans pour les plus âgés du cours avancé, assistent aux cours gratuitement et quotidiennement s'ils le souhaitent et le peuvent. Leur enthousiasme dans le processus d'apprentissage rend chaque cours interactif et dynamique.<br/> <i><br/>Acheter des cahiers, stylos, crayons, gommes, du papier et du matériel à <br/>destination des enfants : 500 $</i><br/> <br/>Notre prochain projet : apprendre à tous les enfants l'utilisation basique et professionnel d'un ordinateur. Traitement de texte, création d'une boîte mail, envoi de courriels, utilisation simple d'excel, recherche google, etc. Toutes ces activités qui nous sont devenues évidentes mais qui sont étrangères à la plupart des jeunes de cette école. Ces cours sont un passage obligé pour eux : ils n'ont pas d'autre moyen d'avoir accès à un ordinateur. <br/> <br/><i>Pour commencer ce cours, acheter des tables, des chaises, des tableaux <br/>weleda, et surtout des ordinateurs : 6000 $</i><br/> <br/></p><h3>Construire</h3><p> <br/>Commencer la construction de salles de classe ""en dur"" est devenu nécessaire quand les moustiques empêchaient les cours du soir d'avoir lieu.

enthousiasme qui ne peut que leur permettre de réussir. A mon retour en France, j'ai voulu contribué au travail de Poeuy en lui envoyant  un colis de fournitures scolaires. Et puis j'ai pris conscience qu'il savait mieux que moi de quelles fournitures il avait besoin. Que ce qu'il lui fallait à présent, c'était avoir toutes les cartes en main pour organiser le futur de son école au mieux. Je lui ai proposé

Une tâche qui représente une importante charge de travail. Poeuy fait appel à des volontaires internationaux qui assistent ou organisent les cours d'anglais. Pour une meilleure organisation des cours et un meilleur suivi des élèves, le professeur a besoin de matériel éducatif, de manuels et de méthodes. Acheter des manuels et du matériel éducatif pour les enseignants : 500 $Payer un enseignement cambodgien pour assurer un suivant permanent des élèves et faire le lien entre volontaires durant un an : 1000 $ Apprendre L'anglais est une langue capitale pour ces enfants s'ils veulent s'ouvrir à plus d'opportunités d'emploi dans leur pays. Les élèves, âgés de 4 ans pour les plus jeunes débutants, à 22 ans pour les plus âgés du cours avancé, assistent aux cours gratuitement et quotidiennement s'ils le souhaitent et le peuvent. Leur enthousiasme dans le processus d'apprentissage rend chaque cours interactif et dynamique. Acheter des cahiers, stylos, crayons, gommes, du papier et du matériel à destination des enfants : 500 $ Notre prochain projet : apprendre à tous les enfants l'utilisation basique et professionnel d'un ordinateur. Traitement de texte, création d'une boîte mail, envoi de courriels, utilisation simple d'excel, recherche google, etc. Toutes ces activités qui nous sont devenues évidentes mais qui sont étrangères à la plupart des jeunes de cette école. Ces cours sont un passage obligé pour eux : ils n'ont pas d'autre moyen d'avoir accès à un ordinateur.  Pour commencer ce cours, acheter des tables, des chaises, des tableaux weleda, et surtout des ordinateurs : 6000 $ Construire Commencer la construction de salles de classe ""en dur"" est devenu nécessaire quand les moustiques empêchaient les cours du soir d'avoir lieu. Poeuy, accompagné de travailleurs locaux, a donc construit deux salles de classe qui servent désormais pour les cours d'anglais. Une maison permettant d'accueillir les volontaires est également en cours de construction. La prochaine étape, c'est la construction de deux nouvelles salles de classe pour accueillir les cours d'informatique. Acheter le matériel, payer les artisans locaux, pour bâtir les nouvelles salles de classe : 6200 $ Partager Nous souhaitons que notre école sache s'intégrer dans son environnement rural et dans la communauté dont nous faisons partie, en participant à son développement et en aidant les familles qui en ont besoin. C'est pourquoi nous souhaitons mettre en place des actions soutenant la communauté.
Planter des arbres fruitiers qui seront une source de nourriture ou de revenus pour les familles les plus dépendantes.

Réparer les maisons endommagées.

Distribuer des filtres dans les foyers pour purifier l'eau afin de la rendre potable.

Acheter des vélos pour les familles n'en disposant pas afin de permettre aux enfants d'aller à l'école librement.

Fournir des semences de riz aux familles les plus démunies, le riz étant la nourriture de base la plus commune au Cambodge.

Tous ces projets d'intégration nous coûteront autour de 2300 $.Notre motivation 
Camille ""J'ai été volontaire à l'école. C'est dans cette école, la première fois,que j'ai vraiment
 compris l'importance de l'éducation. Je crois en cette école, je crois 
en ces enfants parce que Poeuy croit en eux et qu'eux font preuve d'un 
enthousiasme qui ne peut que leur permettre de réussir. A mon retour en France, j'ai voulu contribué au travail de Poeuy en lui envoyant  un colis de fournitures scolaires. Et puis j'ai pris conscience qu'il savait mieux que moi de quelles fournitures il avait besoin. Que ce qu'il lui fallait à présent, c'était avoir toutes les cartes en main pour organiser le futur de son école au mieux. Je lui ai proposé 
d'organiser ce projet de financement pour qu'il puisse prendre en main, seul ou avec ses élèves, le futur de son école.""
Poeuy est le directeur et le créateur de l'école. Il vit à Tnol Trong avec sa femme, ses trois filles et Saneth, une fillette de 12 ans qui vit avec eux afin d'avoir un accès plus facile à l'école locale khmer. Il a eu la chance de pouvoir assister à un cours à Siem Reap, les weekends, ce qui fait de lui  un professeur d'anglais aujourd'hui certifié.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

In permaculture design, we create smart energy efficient systems where elements interact in a mutually beneficial way to produce a greater whole. <br/>Practically it means observing, designing and building systems to provide with my basic everyday needs at a low environmental impact. <br/></span><br/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">It has to be said, the van is a 3 liter diesel engine that requires fuel to drive and thus it also pollutes the environment. As the goal of living in the Van is to become more self aware and sufficient, I aim to </span>compensate<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> for this pollution with a reduction in personal ecological impact. I am also investigating how to reduce the exhaust pollution by the usage of filters, and I will adapt the vehicle so it is possible to run on biodiesel made from waste cooking oil (more on this in a later post !) </span></span><i><br/><br/></i>
<p><b>- The van will be my only home full-time for the next years. </b><br/>I will have the comforts of a traditional home, but everything is just tinier and I will have to use my resources such as power or water wisely. Living with limited resources and space will force me to re-think my choices and habits, and adapt where necessary. </p>
<p><b>- The van is a transport vehicle.</b><br/>For the next years I will be visiting permaculture projects and communities all around Europe, to learn about them and their projects. <br/>By volunteering at various communities, I hope to learn tremendous amounts and become a better permaculture designer ! <br/>I will keep an active blog and 'database' of permaculture projects, designs and systems for everyone to access freely. This way we could learn from each other experiences,  and extend the communal knowledge<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">.</span></p>
<p><b>- The van is BIG.</b><br/>Lucy July, the Van, is a Mercedes-Benz 409D born in 1985 a good 6m long, 3m high 2,3m wide and 3ton heavy. She's been converted to a mobilhome camper for 5 people, fitted with everything you need including a small bathroom ! <br/>August is the engine, a famous OM617 motor. <br/>These cars are known for driving over 1 million km's and they are perfect for driving on biodiesel from recycled oil ! </p>
<p><b>- The van is a personal lifestyle experiment. </b><br/>I will monitor closely how much resources I consume, how much garbage I produce, even how much poop I make ! <br/>By reducing my needs, my consumption and my garbage, I will<span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> see how such a nomadic lifestyle can influence my ecological footprint, compared to my previous urban lifestyle. </span><br/><u style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">Reduce - Reuse - Recycle !</u></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">- The van prefers home made biodiesel above fossil fuels. </b><br/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">One of the main points of the conversion, is to seek </span>independence<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> of big oil companies. I will source used cooking oil (a waste product), filter it and convert it into biodiesel for driving the Van as much as I can.</span><br/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Driving on biodiesel produces less greenhouse gasses, and I'm using a local resource that would otherwise become waste.<br/>Making my own fuel forces me also to engage with the local community.<br/></span>One other aspect of this goal is the law. It is often illegal to drive on fuels that aren't regulated and especially taxed. It is possible in some countries and on private terrain. Recycling waste oil to a resource should be encouraged in my opinion. <br/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Realistically, I don't think I can find enough oil while travelling to drive ONLY on home made biodiesel, but I sure will try ! </span></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">- The van serves the community.</b><br/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Not only will the community benefit through the information shared online, t</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">he van will also be used for teaching introductions to permaculture in all kind of places I go. It can be a mobile outdoor classroom ! </span><br/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Ofcourse I will be giving a lot of rides and sleep-over places (always pick up hitchhikers!) , and I want to form a driving seedbank to exchange plant and vegetable seeds, acting as a steel pollinator between communities.</span></span><br/></p>
<p><b>- The van is technical experiment. <br/></b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I will test all my technical skills repairing and converting this Van, a lot of the systems will be experimental and DIY ! Self made water boilers, solar panels, washing machines, everything needed will pass the stage and all this info will be available on the blog. This way you can even build your own permaculture van! </span></p>
<p><b>- The van doesn't like big company's that suck your soul. </b><br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">This will be a hard but necessary part of the transition. I want to consume less ! </span><br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">That means : finding other ways to get food, for example bartering, volunteering, dumpsterdiving and so on. Recovered clothes and other recycled goods will be the first choice, and if money is involved , it will be used locally to people who can use it instead of shareholders and off-shore tax paradises. </span></p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">- The van needs you ! <br/></b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Lucy July August sure is one hell of a ride if it all works out, and that's where I really need your help ! </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">All my savings went to the purchasing and repairing of the Van to get it back on the road. <br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I have been estimating how much budget I still need in order to get the last repairs done, purchase the materials necessary for the various systems to make this home a low impact permaculture van and the Indiegogo perks and fee's,  <br/>The total estimated amount of funding I need is 4000€.  <br/>This amount will go to the replacing of the molded walls, the building of an electrical system , the compost toilet , the heat exchanger from engine, a water filtering system, DIY solar panels and so on. </span></p>
<p>This sounds like a big amount, but consider that I will be making almost everything myself, I will use recycled or 2th hands goods where ever possible , and it's actually peanuts compared to building a house !<br/> If I would not obtain the 4000€ needed, the Permaculture Van project will still go on with the funds acquired, but everything will take a little more time as I will have to work and save longer. <br/>In the unlikely case that more as the estimated 4000€ is collected, the surplus will be saved as an emergency car breakdown fund and it will help to pay a mentor on my way to my permaculture diploma ! <br/><br/>Currently I aim to have everything ready and start travelling by November 2015 and be at least 2 years on the road, and if the feeling is good , even longer ! </p>
<h2>What do you get back ? </h2>In exchange for your support as a community, I will give back tons of information about permaculture , it's systems and living in a camper.  <br/>I'll be able to tell and teach others about permaculture as a way to live, I will be helping communities and their projects and assist in their permaculture design. <br/>All systems in these communities, such as greywater treatment or composting systems will be investigated, documented and shared for others to learn ! <br/>In the long term, it is the aim to develop a sort of database with info about all different permaculture systems and solutions, while providing travelers and wwoofers some more information about a community :) <br/>Everything will be freely available via the web , and one day, I hope to publish a book of these experiences.  <br/><br/>Also have a look at my unique perks, found here on the right side ! <br/>As an artist and crafter , I will provide you contributors with nice and one of a kind gifts. I will update more about the different perks (with photos) in the near future , contact me if anything is unclear ! <br/><h2>
<br/>How to help ?</h2>You could help in many way's ! <br/>If you can, please consider a donation for this campaign and feel free to choose one of the perks on the right side, I hope you like them ! <br/>Sharing this campaign with friends and family via social media is always fantastic ! <br/><br/>

The van is a permaculture project. 

How can you redesign a vehicle to provide a home that supplies you with most of your daily needs, able to stay off-grid for periods of time, search interaction and balance with all 5 elements (water-earth-energy-air-community) AND do this all as environmentally friendly as possible while being as independent as possible from big corporations ? That's where permaculture comes in. In permaculture design, we create smart energy efficient systems where elements interact in a mutually beneficial way to produce a greater whole. Practically it means observing, designing and building systems to provide with my basic everyday needs at a low environmental impact. It has to be said, the van is a 3 liter diesel engine that requires fuel to drive and thus it also pollutes the environment. As the goal of living in the Van is to become more self aware and sufficient, I aim to compensate for this pollution with a reduction in personal ecological impact. I am also investigating how to reduce the exhaust pollution by the usage of filters, and I will adapt the vehicle so it is possible to run on biodiesel made from waste cooking oil (more on this in a later post !) 
- The van will be my only home full-time for the next years. I will have the comforts of a traditional home, but everything is just tinier and I will have to use my resources such as power or water wisely. Living with limited resources and space will force me to re-think my choices and habits, and adapt where necessary. 
- The van is a transport vehicle.For the next years I will be visiting permaculture projects and communities all around Europe, to learn about them and their projects. By volunteering at various communities, I hope to learn tremendous amounts and become a better permaculture designer ! I will keep an active blog and 'database' of permaculture projects, designs and systems for everyone to access freely. This way we could learn from each other experiences,  and extend the communal knowledge.
- The van is BIG.Lucy July, the Van, is a Mercedes-Benz 409D born in 1985 a good 6m long, 3m high 2,3m wide and 3ton heavy. She's been converted to a mobilhome camper for 5 people, fitted with everything you need including a small bathroom ! August is the engine, a famous OM617 motor. These cars are known for driving over 1 million km's and they are perfect for driving on biodiesel from recycled oil ! 
- The van is a personal lifestyle experiment. I will monitor closely how much resources I consume, how much garbage I produce, even how much poop I make ! By reducing my needs, my consumption and my garbage, I will see how such a nomadic lifestyle can influence my ecological footprint, compared to my previous urban lifestyle. Reduce - Reuse - Recycle !
- The van prefers home made biodiesel above fossil fuels. One of the main points of the conversion, is to seek independence of big oil companies. I will source used cooking oil (a waste product), filter it and convert it into biodiesel for driving the Van as much as I can.Driving on biodiesel produces less greenhouse gasses, and I'm using a local resource that would otherwise become waste.Making my own fuel forces me also to engage with the local community.One other aspect of this goal is the law. It is often illegal to drive on fuels that aren't regulated and especially taxed. It is possible in some countries and on private terrain. Recycling waste oil to a resource should be encouraged in my opinion. Realistically, I don't think I can find enough oil while travelling to drive ONLY on home made biodiesel, but I sure will try ! 
- The van serves the community.Not only will the community benefit through the information shared online, the van will also be used for teaching introductions to permaculture in all kind of places I go. It can be a mobile outdoor classroom ! Ofcourse I will be giving a lot of rides and sleep-over places (always pick up hitchhikers!) , and I want to form a driving seedbank to exchange plant and vegetable seeds, acting as a steel pollinator between communities.
- The van is technical experiment. I will test all my technical skills repairing and converting this Van, a lot of the systems will be experimental and DIY ! Self made water boilers, solar panels, washing machines, everything needed will pass the stage and all this info will be available on the blog. This way you can even build your own permaculture van! 
- The van doesn't like big company's that suck your soul. This will be a hard but necessary part of the transition. I want to consume less ! That means : finding other ways to get food, for example bartering, volunteering, dumpsterdiving and so on. Recovered clothes and other recycled goods will be the first choice, and if money is involved , it will be used locally to people who can use it instead of shareholders and off-shore tax paradises. 
- The van needs you ! Lucy July August sure is one hell of a ride if it all works out, and that's where I really need your help ! 
All my savings went to the purchasing and repairing of the Van to get it back on the road. I have been estimating how much budget I still need in order to get the last repairs done, purchase the materials necessary for the various systems to make this home a low impact permaculture van and the Indiegogo perks and fee's,  The total estimated amount of funding I need is 4000€.  This amount will go to the replacing of the molded walls, the building of an electrical system , the compost toilet , the heat exchanger from engine, a water filtering system, DIY solar panels and so on. 
This sounds like a big amount, but consider that I will be making almost everything myself, I will use recycled or 2th hands goods where ever possible , and it's actually peanuts compared to building a house ! If I would not obtain the 4000€ needed, the Permaculture Van project will still go on with the funds acquired, but everything will take a little more time as I will have to work and save longer. In the unlikely case that more as the estimated 4000€ is collected, the surplus will be saved as an emergency car breakdown fund and it will help to pay a mentor on my way to my permaculture diploma ! Currently I aim to have everything ready and start travelling by November 2015 and be at least 2 years on the road, and if the feeling is good , even longer ! 
What do you get back ? In exchange for your support as a community, I will give back tons of information about permaculture , it's systems and living in a camper.  I'll be able to tell and teach others about permaculture as a way to live, I will be helping communities and their projects and assist in their permaculture design. All systems in these communities, such as greywater treatment or composting systems will be investigated, documented and shared for others to learn ! In the long term, it is the aim to develop a sort of database with info about all different permaculture systems and solutions, while providing travelers and wwoofers some more information about a community :) Everything will be freely available via the web , and one day, I hope to publish a book of these experiences.  Also have a look at my unique perks, found here on the right side ! As an artist and crafter , I will provide you contributors with nice and one of a kind gifts. I will update more about the different perks (with photos) in the near future , contact me if anything is unclear ! 
How to help ?You could help in many way's ! If you can, please consider a donation for this campaign and feel free to choose one of the perks on the right side, I hope you like them ! Sharing this campaign with friends and family via social media is always fantastic ! 

All help is deeply appreciated ! Bless <3

Help me create a valuable foundation for the next generation of world educators and leaders! <br/>Hi,<br/>my name is Marcia Voss and this is my campaign. I am a 24-year-old music student in Germany. I’m a proud dog owner of a 4year old Mexican street mud. Under my passions for life are hobbies such as traveling, languages, music, arts, dance, animals, nature and Bikrahm yoga.<br/>I have never ever asked strangers for donations nor made an online campaign before, but now I found a strong enough reason for me to ask the world to contribute to my cause. <br/>Recently, I've been browsing the Internet for volunteer opportunities abroad and tumbled across a very touching post. In that post a man called Shamser Thapa and his family are doing their best for their poor village in Gaunshahar, Lamjung, Nepal. Gaunshahar is the original abode of the royal family of Nepal, which later relocated to Kathmandu. The small palace and courtyard still host’s traditional festivals that attract hundreds, sometimes thousands of people from all around at many intervals during the calendar year. <br/>Gaunshahar's population is 1000 and is located in the Lamjung district with a population of 6,611 (stats as of 2011), the village has 1 communal place and only 1 communal school. At this moment there are 75 students, aged 3-13, with class sizes no bigger than 12.  In the district of Lamjung the villages have many low-income families, who are struggling in receiving basic education. Most families’ children have basically no chance of education. Shamser and his family, with help from volunteers around the world, such as me, are planning to build a second school so more families have the chance in sending their children to school. <br/>About Heaven Hill Academy<br/> <br/>Shamser Thapa is a local teacher and principal who is passionate about improving his community. Not satisfied with the education system, his vision is to build a new free independent school in the heart of Gaunshahar. A school, which will not discriminate between family income and social class status but will take the poorest of the village children alleviating the financial burden on their families and providing them with quality education they could not otherwise afford. <br/>The Plan <br/>To fund and build a physical school for approximately 40 students from the age of 4 to 8 in the heart of Gaunshahar. <br/>The challenges, which lay ahead of us, are:<br/>•   Find suitable land in the village<br/>•   Source funding to buy the land at an estimated cost of US$ 8,500<br/>•   Secure funding to build the buildings an at estimated cost of US$ 12,600 <br/>•   Gain approval from the education board<br/>•   Design the layout of the school<br/>•   Have a steady flow of volunteers to assist with the build and reduce costs<br/>•   Fit out of the school <br/>•   Design the school emblem and create the logo to match our principles<br/>•   Secure funding for the day to day running of the school - estimated at US$ 600 per month<br/>•   Employee and train 4 teachers <br/>•   Identify worthy students and enroll them<br/>•   Opening day <br/>Progress up to Date!<br/><br/>22 September 2014 - We’ve found suitable land in the heart of Gaunshahar. The farmer, who currently grows crop on the land, is willing to sell so we’re beginning negotiations.<br/> <br/> <br/>30 September 2014 - A generous donation has been received from a previous volunteer. This has allowed us to purchase the land. Once the millet has been harvested, we can start the build!<br/>14 October 2014 - We’ve been granted permission from the local authority in Besishahar to open a school for nursery, lower kindergarten and upper kindergarten classes. <br/> 21 October 2014 - With the help of a volunteer and after weeks of drawings and revisions, we’ve come up with a design for the school which we believe optimises the space we have available.<br/> <br/>26 October 2014 - A further large donation has been received which has allowed us to purchase a water tank for the school, pay for the electricity wiring as well as start breaking the stones.<br/>27 October 2014 - We’ve now started breaking the stones. A family in the village who has land near the school’s location has given permission to use their stone. We’ve employed 2 men local to the village to begin breaking the stone at the quarry. Volunteers have cut in a path into the side of the mountain for access and they’ve started carry the stones from the quarry to the site.<br/> <br/>7 November 2014 - With the help of the volunteers, we’ve created both a logo and school motto. After brainstorming ideas, we believe ‘Pride in our past, skills for the future’ emphasises our aim for the school; to preserve the traditions of the community and provide future generations with the skills and knowledge to achieve. With the pipal tree being an important focal point in this rural community, it’s also our main focal point with the roots representing the past and the leaves the future.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>About Shamser Thapa<br/> <br/>Shamser Thapa is a teacher and principle of a school in the small picturesque village of Gaunshahar, Nepal. The village being the original abode of the Nepali Royal family before they were relocated to Kathmandu.<br/>Shamser was brought up in Gaunshahar, the son of a farming family. Schooled in the local public school, their mornings and evenings were spent assisting the family with chores around the farm, leaving little time for studying. Not much has changed in Gaunsahar in 30 years. <br/>Having graduated from the local high school, Shamser sought higher education but with his father lacking the funds to invest in his son’s education he moved to Kathmandu and took a job in a hotel in Nagarkot as a kitchen porter to enable him to pay for his university degree. Impressing the owner with his English, he was promoted to waiter before finally moving to concierge. Working full time at the hotel proved difficult to fit in the time for study, but with his determination, he managed to secure a degree in English Literature and Population after 3 years. <br/>Graduating Tribhuban University, Shamser continued to save until a time when he was able to move to the West in search of employment opportunities, not unlike the vast majority of men in rural communities in Nepal who struggle to find work. Spending a year and a half in Antwerp working and saving, he realised, in comparison to the West, he missed the close knit community of his hometown; the perfect environment to bring up his family and the perfect place where he could make a difference to the future of the community; something he wasn't afforded in Antwerp.<br/>With ideas for social improvement circling around Shamser’s head, he moved back home. He took a job teaching in a local school in Gaunshahar and was soon made principle. Not resting on his laurels and with the poverty of the village in the forefront of his mind, Shamser continued with small projects borne from the heart.<br/> <br/>This story, as well as all the images on Shamser's websites at  <a href=""http://www.heavenhillhomestay.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.heavenhillhomestay.com</a> &amp; <a href=""http://www.heavenhillacademynepal.org,"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.heavenhillacademynepal.org,</a> touched me deeply. Since I had read the story, I cannot stop thinking about the children and their beautiful villages in the mountains of Nepal. With in the years to come I sincerely wish to travel to Gaunshahr to meet Shamser Tapa, his family and the wonderful children we all have helped establish a foundation for their future! Nepal has been one of my longest dreams, for over 7 years now. Every now and again I envision my stay with them already.<br/>In my opinion, education is of high importance and necessity globally. The lack of education around the world is scary. We know that the United States as well as Europe have enough educational problems but for countries to not have even a choice of getting educated is outrageous, in my mind. I am asking you to help me raise funds so we can send Gaunshahar's and the surrounding village children to get a basic education near their home.<br/>When we archive the goal of $10.000 US Dollars/9390.99 Euros, you have helped build a second school by supplying the funds for all materials needed for building the school, as well as giving the children enough props to start learning such as:<br/>•   Pencils, rubbers/erasers, markers, crayons, colour pencils, sharpeners, and etc. <br/>•   Exercise books, drawing paper, A4-sized printer paper <br/>•   First aid materials (plasters, scissors, wound disinfection) <br/>•   English children's books  <br/>•   Children's clothes <br/>•   Educational board games and toys <br/>•   Radio/CD player <br/>•   Old laptops <br/>•   Light bulbs and lamp covers  <br/>•   Cups, mugs, plates or bowls <br/>•   Toys <br/>•   Cash!<br/>Please be aware of size and weight because all items will be hiked up the mountains. The smaller and lighter the better! :) <br/>How you helped build the new school?<br/>Your donations here → Donation Button! (integrate button)<br/>With your efforts, we also accept any and all materialistic donations sent to the address below. Read further to see a full list of items require for the school or see above mentioned item list in short.<br/>You can personality ship items to:<br/>Heaven Hill Academy   <br/>Gaunshahar-1 Lamjung   <br/>Zone-Gandaki   <br/>Nepal   <br/>Or directly address to Shamser Thapa.<br/><br/>Sending school supplies <br/>We realize many people prefer to send school materials by airmail/courier than donating money. Whilst any donations of supplies are greatly received, it’s unfortunate that in Nepal the customs charges to have parcels greater than 2kg released from the depot in Kathmandu are extremely high, meaning we have to channel much needed money into releasing them. Should you wish to send supplies directly, please get in touch and we may be able to put you in contact with someone from your country who is coming to volunteer and could bring any items. Alternatively, if there are specific items you wish to donate, we can source them here in Nepal and purchase using your kind donation.   <br/>NOTE: When you ship items, make sure you keep a detailed list of items sent in case of damage, loss or theft. Get a durable/heavy duty box and make sure you receive your tracking number. Make sure items in the box are shielded well, cover them with newspaper, Styrofoam or any other gap filling material for safer arrival of package. Best to get package coverage/insurance. <br/>Donations are the best way to help! I will deal with the shipping costs and pack as many suite cases as the airline allows me.<br/><br/>Make a donation<br/>One of the most important parts of our vision for Heaven Hill Academy is the ability to offer quality education free of charge to those children who would not otherwise have access to it. We will be dependent on donations to fund the build, chattels, teaching resources and ongoing running costs (teaching materials, wages, electricity, etc.) initially for the school. Although there are plans to develop an income stream to fund the school on going, this will not be realized until the end of 2015. 100% of all donations received will go directly into providing a child’s free education with nothing taken for any admin costs. We understand the need for transparency when donating to charitable causes, therefore should you wish to donate to the project, we urge you to get in touch and we’ll tell you how your generous donation, however big or small, will be spent.<br/><a href=""http://www.heavenhillacademynepal.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.heavenhillacademynepal.org</a><br/><br/> <br/>Make your cause 2016 the children of Gaunshahar!!!!<br/>Save the children and an amazing culture, hit in April 2015 by one of the largest earthquakes in history of the world with a magnitude of 7.8!!!<br/>Leaving Nepal devastated and in need of our support to rebuild!<br/> <br/>Image credits: Mercy Corps<br/><br/>Disaster Relief:<br/>Links:  <br/>MercyCorps<br/>1.   <a href=""http://nepal.mercycorps.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://nepal.mercycorps.org/</a><br/>ROKPA<br/>1.   <a href=""http://www.rokpa.org/en/what-we-do/nepal.html?gclid=CjwKEAiA7MWyBRDpi5TFqqmm6hMSJAD6GLeApR2tuy68piZAWSg1CMzGOl63cjfolBhaCjVTjFUj0xoCadzw_wcB"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.rokpa.org/en/what-we-do/nepal.html?gclid=CjwKEAiA7MWyBRDpi5TFqqmm6hMSJAD6GLeApR2tuy68piZAWSg1CMzGOl63cjfolBhaCjVTjFUj0xoCadzw_wcB</a><br/><br/>2.   <a href=""http://www.rokpa.org/index.php?id=9&amp;gclid=CjwKEAiA7MWyBRDpi5TFqqmm6hMSJAD6GLeA76YMejvNCbJXp6Go5AAS10ghHK6wdo_EvP11h3NkjBoCn0Hw_wcB"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.rokpa.org/index.php?id=9&amp;gclid=CjwKEAiA7MWyBRDpi5TFqqmm6hMSJAD6GLeA76YMejvNCbJXp6Go5AAS10ghHK6wdo_EvP11h3NkjBoCn0Hw_wcB</a><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> <br/>Find below a complete list done by Shamser Thapa of things needed for the new school: <br/><br/>1.

Once the goal is reached, I will send the money directly to Shamasar Tapa’s account in Nepal via direct deposit/PayPal transfer. <br/>It is very important to me to make the biggest impact possible with the funds collected. The excitement for me lies in establishing a partnership with the Heaven Hill Community for future educational travels, volunteer opportunities, international friendships and relations to better the world where we can.<br/>As some of you know, I've lived already in 6 countries (Germany, Australia, Mexico, States and France) and visited 15 countries. Throughout my travels I have seen and heard a lot. Mexico was my first real encounter with poverty and strong social conflict. Seeing people squished in the tiniest places just to have a roof over their head, seeing stray and diseased animals on a daily roaming the streets, empty buildings of unfinished projects, and the hustle to have a meal per day on the table for each member in the family and than consider it normal. Seeing the different social behaviours when strangers/tourists enter the country unaware of the cultural differences is very provocative, in mind.<br/>Tourism has become a trend and I am not for the trend of travel. If everyone traveling would share their money accurately, consider how you can positively take your vacations while helping the natives and volunteer some hours in building relationships, institutions (such as schools etc.) or other useful deeds needed at the place of your visit, we all would profit from a higher standard of living and friendships globally. <br/>One of my dreams is to make the differences between human cultures and societies just a tiny bit smaller by actively participating and learning different cultures, languages, mindsets and behaviours. I believe if we all work together, with each other, everyone involved will benefit from a life long very valuable journey of progression. <br/>This campaign is the start of my efforts to fund raise and help on a global scale. Writing you this made me realize I want to do this for more people. There are so many causes I feel very passionate about and it would be amazing for me to get your continuous support on the goals we all share.<br/>In the past I have helped a few friends in Australia fund raise to save the Kimberly Mountains among other cause driven events. One thing I do daily is sign petitions and make pledges for a better future through websites such as causes.com, greenpeace, sierra, world wildlife fund, compact.de and many more. I've never done any fundraising or campaigning online in this manner before and hope I am doing well with it, which will show through your support.<br/>My research on volunteer opportunities is and was extensive. There are so many ways to volunteer and help globally. One can go through an organization that will place you to work or find private volunteer projects. Heaven Hill Homestay is a private volunteer opportunity that I chose, to be able to have a more intimate experience with the natives of Nepal. <br/>With this information and campaign my hope remains that it touches you on a humane and heartfelt level to donate the highest amount you can.  The more collective spirit, the quicker help can reach the village children of Gaunshahar, Nepal.<br/><br/>I sincerely thank you in advance for reading, sharing and donating to this cause! <br/><br/><br/> <br/>Risks &amp; Challenges <br/>The challenges I am facing with this campaign are:<br/>1.   The amount I want to raise, will take time, effort and collective spirit!

I am the principal of an academy of learning in Lamjung, Nepal. My family has a homestay located in a beautiful part of North-Western Nepal on the top of a hill with stunning views of Annapurna, Fishtail, Manaslu, Peak 29 and Lamjung. My village is called Gaunshahar and is the original abode of the royal family of Nepal, which later relocated to Kathmandu. The small palace and courtyard still hosts traditional festivals that attract hundreds, sometimes thousands of people from all around at many intervals during the calendar year.<br/>Besisahar is a small town in the valley below and is the starting point of the famous Annapurna Circuit trek. Know that you can also get your trekking permits from Besisahar. We have both accommodation in our homestay as well as a newly built traditional Nepali eco roundhouse made from stone and a straw roof. Both accommodations have western style bathrooms; hot shower available, Internet and plenty of blankets. Our food is sourced from almost entirely local ingredients. We can accommodate vegetarian diets as well. We can also teach volunteers to cook Nepali food, such as chapati for breakfast and Dal Baht as a main course.<br/>We welcome all new volunteers with Tikka and Garlands. Whilst staying with my family, we welcome any help you can give. As the principal of the local school I welcome volunteers that help the children in any way they can, especially with handwriting practice, learning English or even just playing with them or teaching them games. <br/>Don't worry if you have no special skills. I will give assistance with any work that needs doing. This might be painting, building work, cooking or whatever you can offer. A few volunteers started their own novel projects, which were most welcome. Volunteers helped build a clay cob oven, a chimney and ideas of our vegetable garden. You are welcome to use our outside clay oven to bake or cook (we can make pizza). You can buy some ingredients in Besisahar. One volunteer set up a very small library (children's book donations are welcome). Other volunteers helped build the house we live in, and our beautiful garden. Two recent volunteers taught some nursery rhymes and games to our school children during assembly. If you know anything about permaculture, we'd love to learn so we can grow more of our own food. We've collected laptops from volunteers, which have enabled us to run computer classes for free with the children from the village.<br/>We ask volunteers to pay only a total of 5 USD a day to stay here. This cost includes two meals, tea and coffee, free wifi and cold shower. We have a local shop if you want to buy snacks, drinks and other items. We ask volunteers to give four hours help a day in any way you can.

Help me create a valuable foundation for the next generation of world educators and leaders! Hi,my name is Marcia Voss and this is my campaign. I am a 24-year-old music student in Germany. I’m a proud dog owner of a 4year old Mexican street mud. Under my passions for life are hobbies such as traveling, languages, music, arts, dance, animals, nature and Bikrahm yoga.I have never ever asked strangers for donations nor made an online campaign before, but now I found a strong enough reason for me to ask the world to contribute to my cause. Recently, I've been browsing the Internet for volunteer opportunities abroad and tumbled across a very touching post. In that post a man called Shamser Thapa and his family are doing their best for their poor village in Gaunshahar, Lamjung, Nepal. Gaunshahar is the original abode of the royal family of Nepal, which later relocated to Kathmandu. The small palace and courtyard still host’s traditional festivals that attract hundreds, sometimes thousands of people from all around at many intervals during the calendar year. Gaunshahar's population is 1000 and is located in the Lamjung district with a population of 6,611 (stats as of 2011), the village has 1 communal place and only 1 communal school. At this moment there are 75 students, aged 3-13, with class sizes no bigger than 12.  In the district of Lamjung the villages have many low-income families, who are struggling in receiving basic education. Most families’ children have basically no chance of education. Shamser and his family, with help from volunteers around the world, such as me, are planning to build a second school so more families have the chance in sending their children to school. About Heaven Hill Academy Shamser Thapa is a local teacher and principal who is passionate about improving his community. Not satisfied with the education system, his vision is to build a new free independent school in the heart of Gaunshahar. A school, which will not discriminate between family income and social class status but will take the poorest of the village children alleviating the financial burden on their families and providing them with quality education they could not otherwise afford. The Plan To fund and build a physical school for approximately 40 students from the age of 4 to 8 in the heart of Gaunshahar. The challenges, which lay ahead of us, are:•   Find suitable land in the village•   Source funding to buy the land at an estimated cost of US$ 8,500•   Secure funding to build the buildings an at estimated cost of US$ 12,600 •   Gain approval from the education board•   Design the layout of the school•   Have a steady flow of volunteers to assist with the build and reduce costs•   Fit out of the school •   Design the school emblem and create the logo to match our principles•   Secure funding for the day to day running of the school - estimated at US$ 600 per month•   Employee and train 4 teachers •   Identify worthy students and enroll them•   Opening day Progress up to Date!22 September 2014 - We’ve found suitable land in the heart of Gaunshahar. The farmer, who currently grows crop on the land, is willing to sell so we’re beginning negotiations.  30 September 2014 - A generous donation has been received from a previous volunteer. This has allowed us to purchase the land. Once the millet has been harvested, we can start the build!14 October 2014 - We’ve been granted permission from the local authority in Besishahar to open a school for nursery, lower kindergarten and upper kindergarten classes.  21 October 2014 - With the help of a volunteer and after weeks of drawings and revisions, we’ve come up with a design for the school which we believe optimises the space we have available. 26 October 2014 - A further large donation has been received which has allowed us to purchase a water tank for the school, pay for the electricity wiring as well as start breaking the stones.27 October 2014 - We’ve now started breaking the stones. A family in the village who has land near the school’s location has given permission to use their stone. We’ve employed 2 men local to the village to begin breaking the stone at the quarry. Volunteers have cut in a path into the side of the mountain for access and they’ve started carry the stones from the quarry to the site. 7 November 2014 - With the help of the volunteers, we’ve created both a logo and school motto. After brainstorming ideas, we believe ‘Pride in our past, skills for the future’ emphasises our aim for the school; to preserve the traditions of the community and provide future generations with the skills and knowledge to achieve. With the pipal tree being an important focal point in this rural community, it’s also our main focal point with the roots representing the past and the leaves the future.About Shamser Thapa Shamser Thapa is a teacher and principle of a school in the small picturesque village of Gaunshahar, Nepal. The village being the original abode of the Nepali Royal family before they were relocated to Kathmandu.Shamser was brought up in Gaunshahar, the son of a farming family. Schooled in the local public school, their mornings and evenings were spent assisting the family with chores around the farm, leaving little time for studying. Not much has changed in Gaunsahar in 30 years. Having graduated from the local high school, Shamser sought higher education but with his father lacking the funds to invest in his son’s education he moved to Kathmandu and took a job in a hotel in Nagarkot as a kitchen porter to enable him to pay for his university degree. Impressing the owner with his English, he was promoted to waiter before finally moving to concierge. Working full time at the hotel proved difficult to fit in the time for study, but with his determination, he managed to secure a degree in English Literature and Population after 3 years. Graduating Tribhuban University, Shamser continued to save until a time when he was able to move to the West in search of employment opportunities, not unlike the vast majority of men in rural communities in Nepal who struggle to find work. Spending a year and a half in Antwerp working and saving, he realised, in comparison to the West, he missed the close knit community of his hometown; the perfect environment to bring up his family and the perfect place where he could make a difference to the future of the community; something he wasn't afforded in Antwerp.With ideas for social improvement circling around Shamser’s head, he moved back home. He took a job teaching in a local school in Gaunshahar and was soon made principle. Not resting on his laurels and with the poverty of the village in the forefront of his mind, Shamser continued with small projects borne from the heart. This story, as well as all the images on Shamser's websites at  www.heavenhillhomestay.com & www.heavenhillacademynepal.org, touched me deeply. Since I had read the story, I cannot stop thinking about the children and their beautiful villages in the mountains of Nepal. With in the years to come I sincerely wish to travel to Gaunshahr to meet Shamser Tapa, his family and the wonderful children we all have helped establish a foundation for their future! Nepal has been one of my longest dreams, for over 7 years now. Every now and again I envision my stay with them already.In my opinion, education is of high importance and necessity globally. The lack of education around the world is scary. We know that the United States as well as Europe have enough educational problems but for countries to not have even a choice of getting educated is outrageous, in my mind. I am asking you to help me raise funds so we can send Gaunshahar's and the surrounding village children to get a basic education near their home.When we archive the goal of $10.000 US Dollars/9390.99 Euros, you have helped build a second school by supplying the funds for all materials needed for building the school, as well as giving the children enough props to start learning such as:•   Pencils, rubbers/erasers, markers, crayons, colour pencils, sharpeners, and etc. •   Exercise books, drawing paper, A4-sized printer paper •   First aid materials (plasters, scissors, wound disinfection) •   English children's books  •   Children's clothes •   Educational board games and toys •   Radio/CD player •   Old laptops •   Light bulbs and lamp covers  •   Cups, mugs, plates or bowls •   Toys •   Cash!Please be aware of size and weight because all items will be hiked up the mountains. The smaller and lighter the better! :) How you helped build the new school?Your donations here → Donation Button! (integrate button)With your efforts, we also accept any and all materialistic donations sent to the address below. Read further to see a full list of items require for the school or see above mentioned item list in short.You can personality ship items to:Heaven Hill Academy   Gaunshahar-1 Lamjung   Zone-Gandaki   Nepal   Or directly address to Shamser Thapa.Sending school supplies We realize many people prefer to send school materials by airmail/courier than donating money. Whilst any donations of supplies are greatly received, it’s unfortunate that in Nepal the customs charges to have parcels greater than 2kg released from the depot in Kathmandu are extremely high, meaning we have to channel much needed money into releasing them. Should you wish to send supplies directly, please get in touch and we may be able to put you in contact with someone from your country who is coming to volunteer and could bring any items. Alternatively, if there are specific items you wish to donate, we can source them here in Nepal and purchase using your kind donation.   NOTE: When you ship items, make sure you keep a detailed list of items sent in case of damage, loss or theft. Get a durable/heavy duty box and make sure you receive your tracking number. Make sure items in the box are shielded well, cover them with newspaper, Styrofoam or any other gap filling material for safer arrival of package. Best to get package coverage/insurance. Donations are the best way to help! I will deal with the shipping costs and pack as many suite cases as the airline allows me.Make a donationOne of the most important parts of our vision for Heaven Hill Academy is the ability to offer quality education free of charge to those children who would not otherwise have access to it. We will be dependent on donations to fund the build, chattels, teaching resources and ongoing running costs (teaching materials, wages, electricity, etc.) initially for the school. Although there are plans to develop an income stream to fund the school on going, this will not be realized until the end of 2015. 100% of all donations received will go directly into providing a child’s free education with nothing taken for any admin costs. We understand the need for transparency when donating to charitable causes, therefore should you wish to donate to the project, we urge you to get in touch and we’ll tell you how your generous donation, however big or small, will be spent.http://www.heavenhillacademynepal.org Make your cause 2016 the children of Gaunshahar!!!!Save the children and an amazing culture, hit in April 2015 by one of the largest earthquakes in history of the world with a magnitude of 7.8!!!Leaving Nepal devastated and in need of our support to rebuild! Image credits: Mercy CorpsDisaster Relief:Links:  MercyCorps1.   http://nepal.mercycorps.org/ROKPA1.   http://www.rokpa.org/en/what-we-do/nepal.html?gclid=CjwKEAiA7MWyBRDpi5TFqqmm6hMSJAD6GLeApR2tuy68piZAWSg1CMzGOl63cjfolBhaCjVTjFUj0xoCadzw_wcB2.   http://www.rokpa.org/index.php?id=9&gclid=CjwKEAiA7MWyBRDpi5TFqqmm6hMSJAD6GLeA76YMejvNCbJXp6Go5AAS10ghHK6wdo_EvP11h3NkjBoCn0Hw_wcB Find below a complete list done by Shamser Thapa of things needed for the new school: 1.

<p><b></b></p><p></p><p></p></div>","Life as an asylum seeker in Bulgaria's capital Sofia can be isolated and boring. Significant administrative hurdles prevent most asylum seeker children from enrolling in school, and the refugee camps are in quiet parts of town, with no activities provided by the state.That’s where The Refugee Project steps in.For more than four years, we have worked with hundreds of children and adults living in the refugee centres in Sofia, Bulgaria. We organize Bulgarian, English and computer lessons, sports and games, music, cookery and art activities, parties and excursions. What's the point?Every child deserves a childhood. The activities we provide for children (and adults) not only help them to integrate into a new country; they also provide a chance to be creative, to try new activities, to make friends, and to take a break from a difficult period in their lives.What We NeedWe aim to raise $5000 to cover the costs of materials for our classes, activities, events and excursions for the children in the 3 refugee centres in Sofia in 2015. Every cent of the donations will go directly towards these activities, because the project is run by more than 60 volunteers, none of whom are paid.Every dollar makes a difference…

5 dollars provide pencils for 10 children


50 dollars are enough for a whole week of activities in one refugee center


100 dollars will cover the costs of an excursion to a Sofia tourist site for 20 children.

It helped multiple families grow a little extra food last year. It helped the hosts by turning an unused space in to a beautiful variety of people and plants, and at times a hustle bustle of pests lol (we don't allow pesticide use in our gardens). The most important thing I feel we grew last season was hope. The hope of a food secure city and a community oriented mentality.</p>
<p>The Backyard Sharing Program has a very simple structure.</p>
<p> We find host yards and turn them in to gardens. We then pair gardeners, with hosts and once they come to an agreement the fun begins! We helped over 20 people with our first garden and did so with next to no money. But now we want to help a lot more people!</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need </h3> <p>We need all the things that come with gardening. We need good clean healthy soil/manure for amending the beds. We need good seed. We need watering cans and hand tools, rain barrels and composters. We had to rent a rototiller and I feel we are still at a stage where renting is the best way for us :). We are putting in a few planters as part of our Food Is Free side project. We have the ok for two locations to do so! </p>
<p>We need your help to keep helping people!</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>We want to show people that it is easy to grow food! </p>
<p>We want to make it so easy and accessible that the families and kids involved,fall in love with every aspect of gardening! even pulling the weeds! well maybe not pulling the weeds...</p>
<p>
                  
The way we like to do this is.</p>
<p>Free workshops! </p>
<p>As I had said before we helped over 20 people last year. I reached out to alot of Transition Guelph members and had them share their time and knowledge . We hosted canning workshops and companion gardening workshops along with a few more. This year I have asked another volunteer to help me coordinate(Tiffany Baldwin) in hopes of helping that many more people and being able to host alot more workshops!</p>
<p>This is also where the need of funding comes in. We not only want to teach the skills (canning,composting,seed saving,pressure canning, tree grafting and so much more!) but hope to plant some communal fruit bearing tree and shrubs, along with sending home preserves and possibly a few supplies to help participants practice at home. </p>
<p>Where we hope to be the most impactful is in educating our gardeners to extend the fruits of their labours. By teaching these skills and overall helping them grow a passion for gardening, we hope to build food security amongst the families that need it most.</p>

confidence. When our girls feel good about themselves, they treat others
 well, act appropriately in a variety of situations, and have a 
sense of accomplishment that they will carry with them throughout their

<ul>
<li>I'm Andy Short, founder of Sumatra Environmental Education Concern (SEEC). I have been teaching English and Environmental Management, among other subjects, in Indonesia, for more than 12 years. Indonesia is going through a phase of development which is putting massive strain on its natural environment and resources and continued uncontrolled progress will lead to negative consequences for the marine and forest ecosystems, and the amazing, unique species which live there, such as Sumatran Tigers, Orangutans, Gibbons, Elephants, Rhinos, Monkeys, Hornbills, Pangolins, Fruit Bats, Slow Loris, and many, many more.  The consequences of disturbing ecosystem services will negatively impact humans, too.</li>
<li>Young people from normal schools in Indonesia rarely get any chance to see nature and learn about their environment in the field. They are also the majority. We believe the ability to get out and engage with nature and conservation should NOT just be the right of children from wealthy schools, but all children.</li>
<li>After many years of experience and contacts within the Department of Education, and with the hardest-working and most valuable conservation organisations in the country, we have the ability to connect with schools and hundreds of thousands of children in Sumatra and beyond, and an opportunity to encourage them to love and protect their environment.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What we need and what you get</h3>
<ul><li>To legally register as an organisation in Indonesia SEEC will require around $7,500 (£5,700) or 100 million Indonesian Rupiah as funds. This will enable us to be officially registered as a 'yayasan' in Indonesia. Additional funds raised will be used for operational expenses, for rental of a temporary base / office space for SEEC, and to prepare our first proper season of fieldtrips and classes.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Indonesian children have the potential to protect and ensure the survival of hundreds of unique species and the stunning and vital forest home they still live in. All that is required is education, some understanding, and some care, in order to save species and their forest ecosystems, which are vital to supporting life, including human life.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

The bus this campaign is funding:

The bus serves 3 purposes


This multi-function, free to use central Brighton community space - booked via a simple process of direct democracy

All around the outside walls of the bus - A 60ft long, permanent, mobile installation of the Wall Of Ideas - The new way for people in Brighton to influence decision making in their city & bring their own ideas to the table.Now we can take this to people, rather than expecting them to know about & come to us.We will run the Wall Of Ideas all over Brighton, gathering the ideas, dreams, needs, and voices of the potentially digitally excluded, isolated locals, and give them a new way to be heard in the issues they know about and care about most.The bus will be the 4th erection of the Wall Of Ideas. The difference is that
• This time it's going up permanently
• Now the leader of the council + our local MP Caroline Lucas are eager to support.

<p></p>
</div>
<p>The <i>Identity
Quest</i> is the first ever game simulation of a complete linguistic
environment. You play the game, and on the way, acquire the language spoken in
it. </p>
<p>Never before has a language learning been easier or more enjoyable. The <i>Identity Quest</i>
gives you the complete knowledge of a language you’ve chosen to play. You won’t
need anything else playing it. No more study groups or courses. No more embarrassment
or frustration when talking with foreigners because you can’t convey simple
messages as natural and easy as in your native language. </p>
<p>All psychological barriers are gone with the advent of
the game. Natural acquisition meets the best of organized learning, thus
providing you with the easiest way to know a language. You can make your dream a
reality and acquire one, two, three, or maybe five languages.</p>
<p>Originally planned as a 3d real world simulation, The <i>Identity Quest</i> was further rewritten
into a point-and-click casual game with static 2d or 3d scenes, dialog choices,
animated facial expressions, animated mini-games, and cut-scenes to minimize
the development cost.</p>
<p>You may ask why we think our Project is any different
from other mobile apps and language games so abundant in the booming market
these days. Indeed, there are various online games, which are also free. So
yes, why The <i>Identity Quest</i>? </p>
<p>The main distinction between ANY existent linguistic
game and The <i>Identity Quest</i> is the latter’s holistic approach.</p>
<p>If you run a search for language games, you will find
infinite web resources, displaying games in categories. You will see games that
present vocabulary topics, grammar issues, phonics, word-building nuances, etc.
Tons of valuable materials, but emphasizing only ONE point of study. </p><p>
For example, if you choose <i>Animals</i>, you will get drills only on
these creatures, wild or domestic, not connected to anything else. Studying
like this doesn’t immediately incorporate the new elements into your overall
system of knowledge, since there are no links to anything learned before.
Consequently, it takes time for your memory to extract the necessary name when you
need it in a free conversation.<br/></p><p>
This is what we avoid in <i>The Identity Quest</i>. You won’t have tasks
or challenges just for the sake of the material presented in them. Everything
has its meaning and connection with something bigger and deeper. </p><p>
This integrity becomes possible thanks to initial submission of the material
you need to acquire to the gripping story you live in the Game. The logic of
the game world around you asks for your understanding of the CONTEXT, and this
is exactly what makes <i>The Identity Quest</i> unique on the current
linguistic game market. This, and a complex system of the underlying theoretical
principles.</p>

opportunity to acquire the world’s most learned languages.</b> </p><p>The studio will
afford the game players the most interesting, engaging, personalized,
motivating, and quickest way to obtain a fluent command of a chosen language.</p>
<p>We hope that players’ full satisfaction with the Game will stimulate the desire

and other languages, leading to their greater personal growth and more job

<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1226082/files/20150216110335-Story.png?1424113415"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The <i>Identity Quest</i> is a
detective fantasy story about a teenage girl (the language speaker different
from the one spoken in the Game) who is transported to an alternative world, a
mixture of feudalism and striking number of modern and futuristic technologies
provided by magicians. The magicians represent a small privileged group of
people possessing the real power in the kingdom, guarding and multiplying
scientific knowledge and artificially suppressing the nation’s development.<br/></p><p>
The player’s avatar, Claire, finds a book in her father's library. Attracted by its
enigmatic shimmering, she reads its beginning, which is written in the language of
the Game, and falls out of our present reality. </p><p>
The girl regains her senses in a weird forest, awoken by Clarissa, the witch,
who also uses the language of the book but does not look very surprised to find
a strange girl in a deserted place. Seeing Claire’s confusion and
incomprehension, the witch takes the girl to live in her house. </p><p>
Clarissa assumes a guardian role toward Claire, constantly talking to her and
gradually making the girl use the foreign language through completion of
different challenges, including meeting new people and visiting necessary
places. Clarissa, all in all, shows herself as an exceptionally caring
individual. </p><p>
First, unselfishness of her motives is put in doubt at the beginning of the
story when Claire finds a diary of Clarissa’s missing daughter. Further events
of Season 1 don’t reveal the true nature of the witch’s behavior, keeping the
player intrigued and making eager to find out what is going on. </p><p>
Following the game course, Claire needs to become a law-abiding citizen—she has
to obtain documents, enroll to school, and find a job. Each part of the game
approximates Claire to the solution of her mission in this world and her final
returning home.</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1226085/files/20150216110400-Characters.png?1424113440"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>In The <i>Identity
Quest </i>Season 1, there are three main characters:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>--<i>Claire</i>, the player’s avatar, a girl from
our reality, who is accidently transported to a fantasy world.</p>
<p>The game plot implies that at the beginning of the
game she has no knowledge of the language spoken in the game. However, the
player’s previous experience with the language (if there is any) allows them to
regulate the input and number of <i>Hints</i>,
thus varying the time needed for the tasks completion and points earned.</p>
<p>If there’s no such experience, the player simply
guesses the answer and sees the reaction, shown in the comments to the answer
and in Clarissa’s replies. </p>
<p><i style=""font-style: italic;"">--Clarissa</i>, the Royal witch, who runs
into Claire on a forest clearing with a prominent oak tree.</p><i>
</i><p>Somehow, she seems more baffled than shocked to meet a
girl in such weird clothes, and generously takes Claire to live with her. The
witch, seeing that the girl doesn’t understand the language she speaks, offers
to teach her. She also promises to take care of this complete stranger and to pass Claire off as her niece.</p><p>--And one more
mysterious character, who remains hidden until half of the Season, but is omnipresent
and pretty annoying. The player hears him at every possible and impossible
moment.  Mr. X comments on her actions with
encouraging or disappointed remarks, speaking his not-always-kind mind.<br/></p><p>Apart from the main heroes, there are other 27 supportive
and additional characters, some of whom appear only to say a few phrases.</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1226087/files/20150216110440-TheWorld.png?1424113480"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The magical world—the suspicious blend of modern and
fantasy elements—where Claire emerges is restricted to a part of the forest
with Clarissa’s cottage and Kingstown, the capital of the kingdom. </p>
<p>The 12 locations (with 53 different screens and 9
interludes connecting the main locations) form 30 game levels, unevenly divided
into 8 Episodes. Each level adds new mysteries and broadens the heroine’s
perception of the game reality. </p>
<p>Almost all the locations of Season 1 display typical
surroundings a language beginner is supposed to get around:</p>
<p>1. Library</p><p>2. Forest</p>
<p>3. House</p>
<p>4. Town</p>
<p>5. Town Hall</p>
<p>6. Main Square</p>
<p>7. Restaurant</p>
<p>8. Boutique</p>
<p>9. School</p>
<p>10. Store</p>
<p>11. Jeweler’s Store</p>
<p>12. Town Market</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1226089/files/20150216110506-Features.png?1424113506"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>Integrity.</b> All in one game. You don’t need teachers, tutors, courses, and
textbooks anymore. The <i>Identity Quest</i>
gives you a full command of the language you’ve chosen to play in.</p>
<p><b>Fun.</b> The <i>Identity Quest</i> is a
fascinating game of its own value. It contains intrigues, mysteries, hidden
identities, puzzles, and mini-games of different genres. Everything, which will
give you the most pleasure and excitement. The detective story development
entwined with comedy, thrilling and melodramatic situations gives the
gamer a unique experience of being involved in genuine book/movie
adventures.</p>
<p><b>Motivation.</b> The game’s plot and its challenges give you the constant wish to go on
with The <i>Identity Quest</i>, thus
ensuring your progress in the language and lessening your chances of losing interest.</p>
<p><b>Interaction.</b> You can interact with everything in The <i>Identity Quest</i> and get an appropriate response. Almost all the scenes,
mini, and extra linguistic games are replayable with a possibility to choose
differently and see the consequences. You easily pick up the names of things,
clicking on them as many times as necessary. </p>
<p><b>Context.</b> As children explore the world through interaction and learn concepts
from context, going from concrete ideas to abstract ones, The <i>Identity Quest</i> gives you meanings,
derived from the environment surrounding you.</p>
<p><b>Story-driven
acquisition.</b> Unlike other language learning
means, The <i>Identity Quest</i>’s story dominates
everything else. Lexical choices and grammatical structures  stem from
the logic of the story, not vice versa. You live the heroine’s life and acquire
the language of the game on the way. </p>
<p><b>Regulated input.</b> You have a full control of the language input by asking other
characters to repeat or reword the phrases, using any number of <i>Hints</i>, reading translations of the
previous dialogs in the <i>Journal</i>, and
having a nice magic ability to suspend the time. Your initial level doesn’t
matter; by controlling what you get, you progress at your own speed.</p>
<p><b>Multiple languages.</b> Originally written in English for the Russian-speaking audience, The <i>Identity Quest</i> is easily transferable
into other languages. We have already started translating the Spanish and French
versions for English-speakers, English and French versions for
Spanish-speakers, English and Spanish for French-speakers, and English,
Spanish, and French versions for Russian-speakers. If we spark your interest
and get your support, we have Italian, German, and Portuguese in mind as the
additional languages.</p>
<p>We would love to find out what languages you want most
to satisfy your needs, so if you can spare a moment, please leave your comments
for us to consider.</p>
<p><b>Natural acquisition
&amp; organized learning.</b> The <i>Identity Quest</i> has taken the best from
the natural language environment you would have just living in the country, and
the organized learning process where the material is presented in the easiest
to master form. This mixture allows the player to progress much faster than in
either of these environments.</p>
<p><b>Theoretical basis.</b> The holistic simulated linguistic environment of the <i>Identity Quest</i> is the result of the
6-year research carried out by the author of this Project. Linguistics, applied
linguistics, sociolinguistics, psychology, pedagogy, pragmatics, and didactics
all played their role in defining the best principles to simulate the
consistent game world. Based on them, the <i>Identity
Quest</i> imitates a wide range of social interaction and recreates authentic
communication.</p>

funding will make the project closer to reality. </p><p>$200,000 is the money for the
entire Season 1, 8 Episodes, but we realize that it is highly unlikely for a
new, unexperienced team to gather that much.</p>
<p>However, if we are able to raise more than $5,500, we
will be able to hire a freelance programmer, an artist, and a composer, who
will help make the playable alpha version of Chapters 1&amp;2 for the next
attempt to collect the needed funds.</p>
<p>If we are lucky to attract more attention, each $20,000
will provide a month’s work on the project, and $60,000 will make Episode 1
possible.</p>
<p>In addition, the more subsidization we attract, the
more real the game world will become with more 3d features, built-in speech
trainers, advanced animation, console and tablet versions. </p>
<p>The ultimate (and initial) idea is (was) a virtual
reality or an open-world 3d game (like GTA or Quake), but that would require a lot more money.</p>

</div></div>","The Identity Quest is the first ever game simulation of a complete linguistic environment. You play the game, and on the way, acquire the language spoken in it.




The Identity
Quest is the first ever game simulation of a complete linguistic
environment. You play the game, and on the way, acquire the language spoken in
it. 
Never before has a language learning been easier or more enjoyable. The Identity Quest
gives you the complete knowledge of a language you’ve chosen to play. You won’t
need anything else playing it. No more study groups or courses. No more embarrassment
or frustration when talking with foreigners because you can’t convey simple
messages as natural and easy as in your native language. 
All psychological barriers are gone with the advent of
the game. Natural acquisition meets the best of organized learning, thus
providing you with the easiest way to know a language. You can make your dream a
reality and acquire one, two, three, or maybe five languages.
Originally planned as a 3d real world simulation, The Identity Quest was further rewritten
into a point-and-click casual game with static 2d or 3d scenes, dialog choices,
animated facial expressions, animated mini-games, and cut-scenes to minimize
the development cost.
You may ask why we think our Project is any different
from other mobile apps and language games so abundant in the booming market
these days. Indeed, there are various online games, which are also free. So
yes, why The Identity Quest? 
The main distinction between ANY existent linguistic
game and The Identity Quest is the latter’s holistic approach.
If you run a search for language games, you will find
infinite web resources, displaying games in categories. You will see games that
present vocabulary topics, grammar issues, phonics, word-building nuances, etc.
Tons of valuable materials, but emphasizing only ONE point of study. 
For example, if you choose Animals, you will get drills only on
these creatures, wild or domestic, not connected to anything else. Studying
like this doesn’t immediately incorporate the new elements into your overall
system of knowledge, since there are no links to anything learned before.
Consequently, it takes time for your memory to extract the necessary name when you
need it in a free conversation.
This is what we avoid in The Identity Quest. You won’t have tasks
or challenges just for the sake of the material presented in them. Everything
has its meaning and connection with something bigger and deeper. 
This integrity becomes possible thanks to initial submission of the material
you need to acquire to the gripping story you live in the Game. The logic of
the game world around you asks for your understanding of the CONTEXT, and this
is exactly what makes The Identity Quest unique on the current
linguistic game market. This, and a complex system of the underlying theoretical
principles.
на русском   en français

Our principal goal is to give ANY person an
opportunity to acquire the world’s most learned languages. The studio will
afford the game players the most interesting, engaging, personalized,
motivating, and quickest way to obtain a fluent command of a chosen language.
We hope that players’ full satisfaction with the Game will stimulate the desire
to continue with the playing-acquisition in other sequential games of the same
and other languages, leading to their greater personal growth and more job
opportunities.
The Identity Quest is a
detective fantasy story about a teenage girl (the language speaker different
from the one spoken in the Game) who is transported to an alternative world, a
mixture of feudalism and striking number of modern and futuristic technologies
provided by magicians. The magicians represent a small privileged group of
people possessing the real power in the kingdom, guarding and multiplying
scientific knowledge and artificially suppressing the nation’s development.
The player’s avatar, Claire, finds a book in her father's library. Attracted by its
enigmatic shimmering, she reads its beginning, which is written in the language of
the Game, and falls out of our present reality. 
The girl regains her senses in a weird forest, awoken by Clarissa, the witch,
who also uses the language of the book but does not look very surprised to find
a strange girl in a deserted place. Seeing Claire’s confusion and
incomprehension, the witch takes the girl to live in her house. 
Clarissa assumes a guardian role toward Claire, constantly talking to her and
gradually making the girl use the foreign language through completion of
different challenges, including meeting new people and visiting necessary
places. Clarissa, all in all, shows herself as an exceptionally caring
individual. 
First, unselfishness of her motives is put in doubt at the beginning of the
story when Claire finds a diary of Clarissa’s missing daughter. Further events
of Season 1 don’t reveal the true nature of the witch’s behavior, keeping the
player intrigued and making eager to find out what is going on. 
Following the game course, Claire needs to become a law-abiding citizen—she has
to obtain documents, enroll to school, and find a job. Each part of the game
approximates Claire to the solution of her mission in this world and her final
returning home.
In The Identity
Quest Season 1, there are three main characters:
--Claire, the player’s avatar, a girl from
our reality, who is accidently transported to a fantasy world.
The game plot implies that at the beginning of the
game she has no knowledge of the language spoken in the game. However, the
player’s previous experience with the language (if there is any) allows them to
regulate the input and number of Hints,
thus varying the time needed for the tasks completion and points earned.
If there’s no such experience, the player simply
guesses the answer and sees the reaction, shown in the comments to the answer
and in Clarissa’s replies. 
--Clarissa, the Royal witch, who runs
into Claire on a forest clearing with a prominent oak tree.
Somehow, she seems more baffled than shocked to meet a
girl in such weird clothes, and generously takes Claire to live with her. The
witch, seeing that the girl doesn’t understand the language she speaks, offers
to teach her. She also promises to take care of this complete stranger and to pass Claire off as her niece.--And one more
mysterious character, who remains hidden until half of the Season, but is omnipresent
and pretty annoying. The player hears him at every possible and impossible
moment.  Mr. X comments on her actions with
encouraging or disappointed remarks, speaking his not-always-kind mind.Apart from the main heroes, there are other 27 supportive
and additional characters, some of whom appear only to say a few phrases.
The magical world—the suspicious blend of modern and
fantasy elements—where Claire emerges is restricted to a part of the forest
with Clarissa’s cottage and Kingstown, the capital of the kingdom. 
The 12 locations (with 53 different screens and 9
interludes connecting the main locations) form 30 game levels, unevenly divided
into 8 Episodes. Each level adds new mysteries and broadens the heroine’s
perception of the game reality. 
Almost all the locations of Season 1 display typical
surroundings a language beginner is supposed to get around:
1. Library2. Forest
3. House
4. Town
5. Town Hall
6. Main Square
7. Restaurant
8. Boutique
9. School
10. Store
11. Jeweler’s Store
12. Town Market
Integrity. All in one game. You don’t need teachers, tutors, courses, and
textbooks anymore. The Identity Quest
gives you a full command of the language you’ve chosen to play in.
Fun. The Identity Quest is a
fascinating game of its own value. It contains intrigues, mysteries, hidden
identities, puzzles, and mini-games of different genres. Everything, which will
give you the most pleasure and excitement. The detective story development
entwined with comedy, thrilling and melodramatic situations gives the
gamer a unique experience of being involved in genuine book/movie
adventures.
Motivation. The game’s plot and its challenges give you the constant wish to go on
with The Identity Quest, thus
ensuring your progress in the language and lessening your chances of losing interest.
Interaction. You can interact with everything in The Identity Quest and get an appropriate response. Almost all the scenes,
mini, and extra linguistic games are replayable with a possibility to choose
differently and see the consequences. You easily pick up the names of things,
clicking on them as many times as necessary. 
Context. As children explore the world through interaction and learn concepts
from context, going from concrete ideas to abstract ones, The Identity Quest gives you meanings,
derived from the environment surrounding you.
Story-driven
acquisition. Unlike other language learning
means, The Identity Quest’s story dominates
everything else. Lexical choices and grammatical structures  stem from
the logic of the story, not vice versa. You live the heroine’s life and acquire
the language of the game on the way. 
Regulated input. You have a full control of the language input by asking other
characters to repeat or reword the phrases, using any number of Hints, reading translations of the
previous dialogs in the Journal, and
having a nice magic ability to suspend the time. Your initial level doesn’t
matter; by controlling what you get, you progress at your own speed.
Multiple languages. Originally written in English for the Russian-speaking audience, The Identity Quest is easily transferable
into other languages. We have already started translating the Spanish and French
versions for English-speakers, English and French versions for
Spanish-speakers, English and Spanish for French-speakers, and English,
Spanish, and French versions for Russian-speakers. If we spark your interest
and get your support, we have Italian, German, and Portuguese in mind as the
additional languages.
We would love to find out what languages you want most
to satisfy your needs, so if you can spare a moment, please leave your comments
for us to consider.
Natural acquisition
& organized learning. The Identity Quest has taken the best from
the natural language environment you would have just living in the country, and
the organized learning process where the material is presented in the easiest
to master form. This mixture allows the player to progress much faster than in
either of these environments.
Theoretical basis. The holistic simulated linguistic environment of the Identity Quest is the result of the
6-year research carried out by the author of this Project. Linguistics, applied
linguistics, sociolinguistics, psychology, pedagogy, pragmatics, and didactics
all played their role in defining the best principles to simulate the
consistent game world. Based on them, the Identity
Quest imitates a wide range of social interaction and recreates authentic
communication.
We’ve chosen Flexible Funding because even incomplete
funding will make the project closer to reality. $200,000 is the money for the
entire Season 1, 8 Episodes, but we realize that it is highly unlikely for a
new, unexperienced team to gather that much.
However, if we are able to raise more than $5,500, we
will be able to hire a freelance programmer, an artist, and a composer, who
will help make the playable alpha version of Chapters 1&2 for the next
attempt to collect the needed funds.
If we are lucky to attract more attention, each $20,000
will provide a month’s work on the project, and $60,000 will make Episode 1
possible.
In addition, the more subsidization we attract, the
more real the game world will become with more 3d features, built-in speech
trainers, advanced animation, console and tablet versions. 
The ultimate (and initial) idea is (was) a virtual
reality or an open-world 3d game (like GTA or Quake), but that would require a lot more money.
·  Taxes and Fees: profit tax, payroll taxes, IndieGoGo + bank transfer fees, administrative
& legal fees, licensing & software; 
·  Programming: in-game, server, & system programming;
·  Art: character art, interface art (menus, mini & extra games, animations,
cut-scenes, visual effects)
·  Localization: translation into the chosen languages (English, Spanish, French,
Italian or German), development of extra linguistic mini-games for each

·  Music and Sound Effects
·  Other: marketing, social media, etc.
Because we can’t make the game without your help. 
Our team, though proficient in other areas, lacks
members with programming skills and an experienced Project Manager, who will
see the Project to the smallest details we may have overlooked. 
What’s more, we need a concept artist, who is capable
of envisioning the entire game right from the start and intertwining the

<br/><p></p> </div></div>","Seventeen
years of midwifery practice and many summers chatting to
student midwives have led me to believe there are glaring gaps of
necessary knowledge in present midwifery
training.
I am proud to be part of this new project
that will train with-women
midwives in traditional skills and support newly
trained midwives who
before felt unprepared.
We will hold a space for the brave midwives previously
persecuted around the globe
to share their infinite wisdom.

Our school will be in the foothills of the
Sierra Nevada Mountains,
Southern Spain.
The fertile land is abundant with oranges,
lemons, almonds and olives.
Year round sunshine and gushing water from the
100 year old irrigation
system enable us to grow food. We will take
studies back to a basic
wisdom. Living on the land, nurtured and inspired students and teachers
will flourish from the earth up.We have gathered the sharpest, most passionate
minds in midwifery to
create a centre of wisdom away from modern
medicine, protocol and
insurance issues which stop true midwifery from
flourishing as a profession.
Rather than fighting a non functioning system,
we are creating a new
paradigm........ Starting afresh.
***

The
first year long apprenticeship began in October 2014.  8 full-time students
are living and learning at camp Luna (as named by the students!) and we are enjoying
the wisdom of teachers from around the world.

People want the space passionately....

We need to find €15,000 to complete the
school infrastructure.

This will be spent on our building team who are
working so hard to
create this stunning space.
We are lucky enough to have Steve James as our
designer and project
manager with a dedicated team of volunteer
builders.


The
money is needed for feeding the gang, a salary for Steve
and pocket money for the volunteers. Costs for
the general
infrastructure are €650 a week to keep us
rocking and if we plough on
we reckon we will finish by autumn.....

We urgently need to buy the remaining roof
materials (we already bought
the large roof beams)…
We have been donated a fabulous Land Rover to
use during the
build, but we have to put diesel in it....

Please trust every penny will be used wisely.

A detailed list of needs and wants can be found
at the end of this
information.

Donate generously to create a ground breaking
community of birth
revolutionaries!***




Da-A-Luz has existed for more than 15 years...Women have come to birth their babies with nature and a team of lay midwives.
Aspiring birth workers have come to learn
skills, be nurtured and take
their knowledge back to their communities.
The Da-A-Luz project counsels women through
miscarriage, birth trauma
and termination, being a point of contact for
non-judgmental and loving
support in the community.
Our Birth Rocks and Essence of Birth retreats
have been an inspiration
to spirit and mind for many beautiful women
struggling to work in a
system that does not support them.
Da-A-Luz also tours Europe in the fabulous Big
Black Truck with a
geodesic dome dedicated to educating parents in
all their birth
choices. We wow the festivals with our funky space,
this year sponsored
by Lush and Mike Flannagan. Our workshops for
both pregnant women and
birth professionals change lives.


Vanessa Brooks, founder and project leader is
active with the Global
Midwifery Council and works with the Midwifery
Today European
Conferences, helping to turn heads to towards a
new yet ancient
birthing culture.
***

What Are
We Doing?
We are building a school dedicated towards
creating a new paradigm in
midwifery education - women based learning. Away
from the belief that
birth is merely a medical event.

We are creating a learning space for wise women
around Europe and a
sanctuary for those who feel unsupported by a
medicalised and
fragmented system.

What Have
We Got Already?

We have already started building with the help
of a donation from Antje
Martje, a midwife from the Netherlands and an
incredible offer from
ecobuilder Steve James who is our architect. We
have already built the
foundations and first few feet of wall and
prepared all the wood and
infrastructure to start the final push to finish
the space for Spring.
Nick Price, dry stone waller teaches the team of
volunteers, who have
given their time for food and nurturing in the
heat of the Alpujarras
mountains.
We have a community of beautiful folk who are
working hard to make this
vision come true.
We have a group of brave and wise teachers from
around the world lined
up to teach.
We are a third way through our first year of
study.

it, how that person manages it, how s/he invests it (turn it into more) and how

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><b>The School:</b> <br/></p>
<p>The Talimi Haq School was established in 1998 as an innovative learning center for the children of the working poor in Howrah, an industrial suburb of Kolkata, India. The school is located in the Priya Manna Basti (a slum settlement, characterized by cramped
housing, poor environmental conditions, near non-existent health care
and chronic poverty.) <br/></p>
<p></p>

<p>The current enrollment at
the school is approximately 250 students, ranging in age from 3 to 16. The primary focus of the school is not
only on establishing vital language, literacy and numeracy skills, but just as
importantly on the arts, including music, dance and drama, and, overall, on creating an environment conducive to developing the
self-respect and dignity that make healthy, well-rounded and civic-minded individuals. <br/></p>
<p>For these children, many of whom enter the labor market by the age of 13, the
Talimi Haq School represents a privileged (and singular) space of safety,
caring, nurturing, and support otherwise lacking in their lives. </p>

<b>Head Teacher: Amina Khatoon</b><br/><p>The teacher in charge at
the school, Amina Khatoon (pictured above), has been working at the school since its inception 17 years ago.<span>  She, along with her crew of seven other community based teachers, share a truly
remarkable dedication to the mission of bringing education to the poor and marginalized children of Howrah</span>. Ms. Khatoon received an Infochange Media Fellowship, and published a series articles on life in the Priya Manna Basti, and the challenges of education, economy and health-care that the mostly poor, Muslim residents of the slum face. Nothing describes the problems and promise of education in the Priya Manna Basti better than Amina's own words, published in a series of articles here:</p>

<b>Our Current Undertakings</b>:</h3>
<p>With your support, and according to plans well worked out in advance by the teachers at Talimi Haq, the school plans to initiate two new education and empowerment projects: 1.) a sewing school and 2.) a health clinic that will provide regular access to reproductive health care for teenage girls, as well as classes for these same girls in self and community-health care. <br/></p>
<p>These two projects, together, will provide a platform for the girls of the Talimi Haq School to secure better opportunities for their own futures, both in terms of economy and health care.<br/></p>
<h4>
<b>The Sewing School:</b><br/>
</h4>
<p>Tailoring is a traditional trade in Bengal, but it is also a skill that, because of a lack of resources, few young people are presently learning, particularly in the slums. Sewing is valued by the women of the community because it enables them to bring money into the home, and can also help sustain young women and their children in the (all to common) event of the loss of or abandonment by a spouse.</p>
<p>The sewing school will produce handicrafts and other tailored goods for sale through established fair trade channels. This money will go towards the operation of the school and the eventual self-sustainability of the project. It will also provide girls a very marketable skill, which will allow them a measure of economic independence, under otherwise constrained circumstances.<br/></p>
<p>We are asking you to help out in providing the funds for space, machinery and personnel to get this project off the ground.</p>
<h4>
<b>Health Care:</b>
</h4>In this community women typically marry and start having children at a young age, sometimes as early as 14 years old. By the time they are in the mid-twenties many women in the community are entirely overburdened with the struggle of maintaining families with an average of five children per household. In addition, malnutrition, poor sanitation, and lack of proper health care results in high rates of maternal mortality.<br/><br/>The health project envisioned by Ms. Khatoon will provide for a bi-weekly health clinic, with a certified gynecological doctor, who will give the girls regular examinations and screenings, as well as family planning counseling. The project will also involve a course, run by Ms. Khatoon and two other women teachers at the school, in self-health care and empowerment. This project will be overseen in consultation with Dr. Joia Mukherjee, Harvard University Department of Global Health and Social Medicine and Medical Director of the world-renowned organization Partner's in Health (PIH):<br/><br/><a href=""http://ghsm.hms.harvard.edu/person/faculty/joia-mukherjee"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://ghsm.hms.harvard.edu/person/faculty/joia-mukherjee</a><br/><br/>

General supplies, room rental and local staff support for two years will be $9,790. </p>
<p>Two years allows time for future donors to witness the project's value to the community, for students to start producing garments that can be sold to raise funds, and for us to develop a sustainable funding model.<br/></p>

</div><div> <p>We will begin at once to work on a sustainable funding model. In India, this is much easier to do for a project that is underway. Local businesses people, politicians, and community leaders already respect Talimi Haq School. When they see how the sewing classes and health education are being received by the community they will be encouraged to support our project. But we will not rely on donations. We believe that self-sustaining money can be raised by selling items through a fair trade NGO. <br/></p>

Two years allows time for future donors to witness the project's value to the community, for students to start producing garments that can be sold to raise funds, and for us to develop a sustainable funding model.
Please see a detailed budget for these programs below.

GivingWe are happy to accept any donations big or small. All donations will go directly to these projects without administrative overhead of any sort. The organizers of this campaign do not have charitable status, and as such we regret that your donations may not be tax deductible.  For birthdays, Christmas, Hanukkah, or other special occasions give the
 gift of a donation in the person's name, For a gift of $200 receive a present sewn by the young
 women you have empowered with your contribution. For other perks and dedicated giving see our Perks page. If we raise less than $19,875 we will offer as many sewing and health 
classes and hours of medical counseling as funds allow. Meanwhile we 
will explore alternative funding sources.
  

The Challenges to Overcome

 We will begin at once to work on a sustainable funding model. In India, this is much easier to do for a project that is underway. Local businesses people, politicians, and community leaders already respect Talimi Haq School. When they see how the sewing classes and health education are being received by the community they will be encouraged to support our project. But we will not rely on donations. We believe that self-sustaining money can be raised by selling items through a fair trade NGO. 
Other Ways You Can Help
 Perhaps you are unable to make a donation now. You can still help us to achieve our goals by telling your family and friends about our campaign and encouraging them to visit our Indiegogo website to make a donation. Get the word out through Facebook and other social media!
Ask to be put on our Friends List so we can send you links to videos and photos of the project and regular updates.

<p>  In
the summer of 2015 I am planning on attending a service learning trip in South
Korea. As most of you know I am a social work major and a huge component of
being successful in this field involves hands on experience helping those in
need. The purpose of this trip is to engage in social work practice while also
gaining knowledge about what it is like to work with diverse populations and
adapt to the differences abroad. </p>
<p>  While
in Korea I will have the opportunity to work approximately 30 hours a week in an agency that helps children and youth with developmental disabilities. It is an opportunity to give my knowledge and compassion to the
people of South Korea and immerse myself into their community. </p>
<p>  I
am incredibly passionate about the field of social work. For as long as I can
remember volunteering has been my passion and the one true thing that brings me
complete happiness. In the process of my studies I am trying to acquire as many
experiences and opportunities to learn skills to become the best
social worker possible and have all of the resources to promote change in the
lives of those who are suffering and in the world. Through going to Korea I
will gain these valuable skills and experiences that I hope to use in our
community one day. </p>
<p>  I
will leave for Korea the May 31st and be there for one month. I will be attending with a professor of social work who is actually
from Korea along with many other Chico State students. We will spend our week
days volunteering at a variety of human service agencies and on the weekends we
will be immersed into the culture with the natives. I truly can’t explain how
excited I am that this opportunity has come before me, the benefits that it has
on my education and my life are numerous. </p>
<p>  As
my friends and family I am asking if you would like to be a part of my journey
through a small sponsorship or simply through your prayers and positive
thoughts. I cannot wait to embark on this journey and create some positive
change in the lives of those who are struggling in Korea; however I am even
more thrilled to become a social worker who is equipped to handle all that is
thrown at me and help the people of our community. If you would like to be a part
of my journey you can donate here. As a sponsor I will keep you informed about my time in
Korea and when I return I would like to share with you my experience. </p>

<p>
</p>
<p>Our son was diagnosed with Autism 6 years ago. Life was difficult and
stressful having to plan around all the issues that children on the Spectrum
have. Our daughter, who was 9 at the time, always seemed to be left out, as we
had to cater more for our son who was very rigid instead of our easy going
girl.  We longed to be able to find a way to enjoy both our children and
to be able to connect as a family. We chose camping as a way to accomplish this
as it met our financial, time and therapeutic needs.  Through camping, our son has been able to
manage many of his sensory overload issues, such as coping with insects, heat
and cold, using an unfamiliar toilet and becoming used to getting dirty and
enjoying natural experiences. He also had to learn how to cope with many
unstructured activities and to not be so rigid in a routine; it was ok for him
to not be in bed by 7:30pm as there were marshmallows to roast and stars to
explore. He also had no sense of danger and would often run away when he became
overly anxious. We therefore used camping and our experience with wilderness
survival to teach him how to become aware of dangers around him, teach him basic
survival techniques and also how to self sooth and calm himself in order to
manage his anxiety. These are just some of the things we want to share with and
teach families in our camping workshops.</p>
</div><p>We have found the perfect property to fulfil our dreams. It is 22 acres of beautiful bushland set in the foothills of the Alpine mountains in Victoria, Australia. We are asking for donations in the amount of $250,000. This money will go towards securing a loan for the total amount of the purchase price of the property which is currently priced at $595,000. The money raised through this campaign will go towards purchasing the property and doing the necessary works to make it a safe and secure area to run these camping workshops. In order to make the property safe, it needs a significant amount of maintenance and upgrades such as clearing of undergrowth and building a toilet block to accommodate the campers participating in the workshops. In the event we don't reach our full campaign goal, any money raised will be used to help secure the property with a loan from a financial institution.</p><div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>You may ask why do we want to do this and what
qualifications do we have to be successful in our endeavour? Raising a child
with Autism is a daily struggle and each child on the Spectrum is unique
in their abilities and challenges. We do understand this. Our aim is to help as
many families as we can to find a positive outlet in an activity all of the
family can enjoy together. In Victoria
alone, there is a minimum of a six month waiting list for families of children
with special needs to partake in respite camps or farm stays. That is a long
time to wait to participate in any kind of activity that can cater for their needs.
Raising a child with additional needs takes a toll on families and many of
these families do not have a lot of additional money to be able to take
holidays. Camping can be a cheap and convenient way for a family to take a much
needed break whenever their schedule allows, which is another reason we have
been enjoying this activity for 6 years.</p>
<p>So who are we? We are 2 families that have been the best of
friends for 8 years who will be operating as a partnership. We have been together through the diagnosis of our son, the challenges and the successes. We camp together regularly as a family group. Between the 4
adults our formal qualifications include a former member of the US Army Special
Forces who now owns and operates his own Private Security Firm specialising in
Close Personal Protection and Physical Environment Protection. There are also 2
former nurses with over 20 years combined experience with specialties in Paediatric
and Mental Health nursing. Two of us are also Certified Trainers, one with a Masters in Public Health who specialises in Community Education. Finally, we have a Builder with demolition and large
rig experience which will be useful when making upgrades and ongoing maintenance
to the property. As an added assistance with our camps, we have a Licensed
Family Therapist who is also an Occupational Therapist with special training in
Autism Spectrum Disorders who has expressed interest in participating in these
camping workshops. </p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>There is never any thing without risk and challenges.</p>
<p>Our number one challenge, is to raise enough money to purchase and upgrade the property to make it the safe environment we wish to offer.  In the event we do not raise enough money for this property, then we will look at purchasing a different property that will again allow us to conduct these learning workshops.  We believe in what we are doing and know it works as it has worked for our family.<br/></p>
<p>The next challenge we will face will be making the property safe and secure for families.  The property is at the foothills of the Alpine region in Victoria and does back on to a state forest.  As avid campers and outdoors people, we know what to look for and will remove, if possible, anything that may pose any type of risk for the families so they will have a safe and enjoyable stay.  This includes erecting a new fence around the property and clearing of underbrush.  </p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We understand that not everyone has the financial means to donate money to our campaign.  Any help you can offer in getting our story out to the world and help publicise our campaign would be a tremendous help.  Just because you cannot financially support us, you can still support us by spreading the word on social media and by word of mouth.  If you know an organisation that may be interested in our campaign, please let them know about us.  Don't forget to use sharing tools right here at Indiegogo.com.</p>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Amidst soaring Himalayan mountains and diverse cultures that fascinate the world, Nepal’s massive earthquake devastated that
country’s <b>only film school</b>– <a href=""http://oscar.edu.np/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://oscar.edu.np/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Oscar International College of Film Studies</a>. </p>

<br/>
<p>It was only when Oscar started in 2005 that locals began formally learning how to craft and share their own fascinating stories through filmmaking.</p>
<p>In this hard-pressed land, helping survivors rebuild lives is vital, but so too are the arts which give us deeper connections, understanding and joy.  In all of Nepal, Oscar is the sole college that teaches the art of film.</p>
<p>In the
words of Oscar’s Dean, filmmaker Binod Paudel:</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><i>“Crisis can create wonderful stories and narrative in cinema. </i></b><b><i>So, we just want to experiment with lowest technologies to get </i></b><b><i>better output and show the world that less money can create something </i></b><b><i>very creative and beautiful too.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>We will be grateful even if we can</i></b><b><i> get outdated equipment such as </i></b><b><i>HD cameras, some inexpensive lights and</i></b><b><i> audio recorders in working condition.”</i></b></p>
<br/><p></p>

<br/>
<h3>The Bigger Picture</h3> <p></p>
<p>Together, via <a href=""http://www.weone.us/rebuilding-nepal-s-only-film-school--oscar-intl.-.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">We One</a> (an officially registered 501(c)3 nonprofit), we'll fund-raise and deliver several camera &amp; light kits ($10,000), plus a year’s rent for classrooms while the campus rebuilds (another $10,000). Money goes a long way in Nepal and <b>US donors' donations are tax-deductible</b>. </p>
<p>Being one of the <b>world’s most affordable non-subsidized
film schools</b> (tuition is <span>$1,400/year;
while 20% of
the students have need-based scholarships), Oscar’s never had a lot of
equipment: a single Red digital cinema camera and several 5Ds (professional HD video cameras), yet its impressive alumni have achieved
recognition at major film festivals like </span>Venice, Busan and Berlin. </p>
<p>Now, with the
earthquake having destroyed much of that equipment, your pledges and
encouragement will make a huge difference for these students. </p>

<h3><b>Our Goals</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>After
achieving and delivering one goal, we’ll focus on fulfilling the next.</p>
<p><b>First </b>raise $10,000 for camera and production gear (<b>your donations of used equipment are tax-deductible</b>, contact us for more details); </p>
<p><b>Second </b>raise another $10,000 for a year’s
temporary classroom rent; </p>
<p>If together, we make our first 2 goals, then
our final goal is in reach too.</p>
<p><b>Finally</b> raise $60,000 to
rebuild the main building in a creative, cost-effective, environmentally friendly
and earthquake-resistant manner.</p>
<p><b>All net
proceeds will go to these goals </b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b><b><br/></b></b></h3>
<h3><b><b>More Details</b></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>SHORT-TERM GOAL:</b></p>
<p><b>Raise $10,000</b> to partially replace
and deliver equipment destroyed in the earthquake, including:</p>
<p>3-4
Canon 5D or 7D DSLR camera-kits (used equipment donations are tax-deductible)</p>
<p>2-3
basic light kits</p>
<p>2 audio
recorders (used equipment donations are tax-deductible)</p>
<p>Since
the earthquake, the entire student body has been sharing a single 5D camera to
shoot their practical exams.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>MEDIUM-TERM GOAL:</b></p>
<p><b>Raise $10,000</b> to pay for a year’s
rent of temporary classroom facilities while the school rebuilds.  </p>
<p>With the
monsoon season upon us and then the Himalayan Winter approaching, funds will be
used to rent space to temporarily house the college’s classes while rebuilding
begins.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><b><br/></b></b></p>
<p><b><b>FINAL GOAL:</b> </b></p>
<p>In the
long run, funds will be used to rebuild the college classrooms and studio in a
clever, environmentally friendly way. 
This additional <b>$60,000 will
complete the project</b>.  Money goes a
long way in Nepal.</p>
<p><b><i>“My</i></b><b><i> <span>perception about budget is different. I want to build
the building<br/>
creatively not lavishly. We do not need a lavish
or standard kind of<br/>
building. We are artists and we know how to
survive in bad condition.</span></i></b></p>
<p><b><i>I want to make our simple building
environmentally friendly, earthquake</i></b><b><i><br/>
<span>resistant and good-looking in very low cost. I
have been researching related<br/>
construction types and I can say that within 60 thousand US dollars, we can build such a building for 150 students.""</span></i></b></p>

<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Caveats</b></h3>
<p>The cost of transporting and delivering camera packages to Nepal, and any import duty will be covered through the funds raised. Update October 17, 2015: Please note that We One board member Yatin Parkhani will be travelling to Nepal at his own expense to deliver the first batch of gear and that will hugely reduce any delivery costs (import duties excepted).</p>
<p>For donors selecting Room or Building naming rights rewards: if the amount raised via indiegogo is not enough to rebuild the campus building, then these rewards will be implemented once the college is able to raise additional funds to complete construction.  Any Diamond-level donation of $30,000 will be held and secured in the WE ONE bank account and released to Oscar International College of Film Studies upon initiation of building reconstruction projects. <br/></p>While Oscar International College of Film Studies is established, popular, has a stable student body, and continues operations, there is no guarantee of the college's functional capacities in the future (i.e. a natural, financial, social, or political disasters or obstacles could occur).    <br/>
</div><div>Credit card donors from outside of the United States may be charged an additional currency conversion fee by their own credit cards.

</div></div>","Update December 1, 2015
Rebuilding Oscar International Film School and Nepal landed in premiere magazine Vanity Fair.  This article by Mark Edward Harris was sparked by writer and supporter Eric Hiss and our collective efforts. Thank you all for being a big part of this special story.
Yatin ParkhaniUpdate October 17, 2015
As our formal Indiegogo campaign winds down today, I want to thank you all for helping raise over $1400 and one donated 5D camera package (worth $1500!). I will be traveling to Nepal (at my own expense) in early November to deliver the contributions to the film school.  In the meanwhile, tax-deductible donations continue on US nonprofit WeOne's simpler, yet equally secure and dedicated donation page. 
Thank you all for being such generous beings
Yatin Parkhani

The Story
Amidst soaring Himalayan mountains and diverse cultures that fascinate the world, Nepal’s massive earthquake devastated that
country’s only film school– Oscar International College of Film Studies. 


Today its 120 pupils study under tents and in temporary shelters; their camera gear largely destroyed and classrooms condemned. Now your US tax-deductible donation can help.



It was only when Oscar started in 2005 that locals began formally learning how to craft and share their own fascinating stories through filmmaking.
In this hard-pressed land, helping survivors rebuild lives is vital, but so too are the arts which give us deeper connections, understanding and joy.  In all of Nepal, Oscar is the sole college that teaches the art of film.
In the
words of Oscar’s Dean, filmmaker Binod Paudel:

“Crisis can create wonderful stories and narrative in cinema. So, we just want to experiment with lowest technologies to get better output and show the world that less money can create something very creative and beautiful too.
We will be grateful even if we can get outdated equipment such as HD cameras, some inexpensive lights and audio recorders in working condition.”

   


The Bigger Picture 
Together, via We One (an officially registered 501(c)3 nonprofit), we'll fund-raise and deliver several camera & light kits ($10,000), plus a year’s rent for classrooms while the campus rebuilds (another $10,000). Money goes a long way in Nepal and US donors' donations are tax-deductible. 
Being one of the world’s most affordable non-subsidized
film schools (tuition is $1,400/year;
while 20% of
the students have need-based scholarships), Oscar’s never had a lot of
equipment: a single Red digital cinema camera and several 5Ds (professional HD video cameras), yet its impressive alumni have achieved
recognition at major film festivals like Venice, Busan and Berlin. 
Now, with the
earthquake having destroyed much of that equipment, your pledges and
encouragement will make a huge difference for these students. 


Our Goals

After
achieving and delivering one goal, we’ll focus on fulfilling the next.
First raise $10,000 for camera and production gear (your donations of used equipment are tax-deductible, contact us for more details); 
Second raise another $10,000 for a year’s
temporary classroom rent; 
If together, we make our first 2 goals, then
our final goal is in reach too.
Finally raise $60,000 to
rebuild the main building in a creative, cost-effective, environmentally friendly
and earthquake-resistant manner.
All net
proceeds will go to these goals 



More Details

SHORT-TERM GOAL:
Raise $10,000 to partially replace
and deliver equipment destroyed in the earthquake, including:
3-4
Canon 5D or 7D DSLR camera-kits (used equipment donations are tax-deductible)
2-3
basic light kits
2 audio
recorders (used equipment donations are tax-deductible)
Since
the earthquake, the entire student body has been sharing a single 5D camera to
shoot their practical exams.



MEDIUM-TERM GOAL:
Raise $10,000 to pay for a year’s
rent of temporary classroom facilities while the school rebuilds.  
With the
monsoon season upon us and then the Himalayan Winter approaching, funds will be
used to rent space to temporarily house the college’s classes while rebuilding
begins.



FINAL GOAL: 
In the
long run, funds will be used to rebuild the college classrooms and studio in a
clever, environmentally friendly way. 
This additional $60,000 will
complete the project.  Money goes a
long way in Nepal.
“My perception about budget is different. I want to build
the building
creatively not lavishly. We do not need a lavish
or standard kind of
building. We are artists and we know how to
survive in bad condition.
I want to make our simple building
environmentally friendly, earthquake
resistant and good-looking in very low cost. I
have been researching related
construction types and I can say that within 60 thousand US dollars, we can build such a building for 150 students.""

– Dean Binod Paudel
  


Donate Multiple Ways

Working
with We One (an officially registered 501(c)3
nonprofit), Oscar can also accept online donations
securely at We One’s own website, where American Donors’ contributions are also tax deductible. 
DONATE YOUR USED CAMERA GEAR (It’s
Tax-Deductible):
Additionally,
if you have gently-used Canon 5D cameras, lenses or gear and are based
in LA, the Bay-area or South Florida, We One can collect these donations AND
provide tax write-offs for fair market value.
To arrange for donating equipment, contact We One's Yatin Parkhani at yatin@beyondmaya.com or call +1 (718) 312-9327
Note: 5D camera donations are valued at Room Naming Rights reward-level.





Final ThoughtsOscar's film students come from remote valleys and soaring
mountains, Himalayan cities and farming villages  – places many of
us will never reach. But combining the ancient power of story with modern
motion-picture tools, these young filmmakers can take us into their own fascinating worlds.
Together, let's give them that chance. 


“The earthquake has taught us a good lesson in being human. Helping each other in your
capacity is always joyful and peaceful movement for the life [sic]. So, our motto would be: 'Creating
filmmakers in Nepal and for the world in an artistic, humane way and at very low
cost.'""
– Dean Binod Paudel

Caveats
The cost of transporting and delivering camera packages to Nepal, and any import duty will be covered through the funds raised. Update October 17, 2015: Please note that We One board member Yatin Parkhani will be travelling to Nepal at his own expense to deliver the first batch of gear and that will hugely reduce any delivery costs (import duties excepted).
For donors selecting Room or Building naming rights rewards: if the amount raised via indiegogo is not enough to rebuild the campus building, then these rewards will be implemented once the college is able to raise additional funds to complete construction.  Any Diamond-level donation of $30,000 will be held and secured in the WE ONE bank account and released to Oscar International College of Film Studies upon initiation of building reconstruction projects. While Oscar International College of Film Studies is established, popular, has a stable student body, and continues operations, there is no guarantee of the college's functional capacities in the future (i.e. a natural, financial, social, or political disasters or obstacles could occur).    
Credit card donors from outside of the United States may be charged an additional currency conversion fee by their own credit cards. Please factor this into your donation if your credit card is a non-US one.  Note that US donors' donations ARE tax-deductible, but that non-US donors' donations may not be tax-deductible (please check in your own countries).

Peru has many disadvantaged
communities that lack essential things for a good quality of life. Lobitos is one of the many economically disadvantaged towns that lacks access to basic
needs such as clean water, sewage system, quality education and opportunities
for social inclusion and development. 
Despite
their poor economic conditions, the town believes there is more to wellbeing and

project which is investigating how to build communities based on eight
dimensions of wellbeing: economic, social, cultural, material, psychological,
spiritual, environmental, and physical. The program is already running in
Colombia, Chile, and Ecuador.

We are scientifically investigating a new way to
build communities – the wellbeing way.HOW IS THIS APPROACH DIFFERENT?
Many approaches just focus on the economic development of marginalized communities. While this is clearly important, this one-sided approach can cause other problems such as environmental damage, community fragmentation and loss of culture and spirituality. Our approach takes all these dimensions into account when helping the community plan its business and community development.WHAT WILL BE THE OUTCOME?
40+ local community members completing a program who rate their experiences as life changing and who are motivated to continue their journey;
Identification of areas of wellbeing strength and weakness in the community;
Identification of new business opportunities that can improve community wellbeing

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE LEAVE? SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY
Long-term sustainability is achieved by:Including a local permanently-based NGO (Waves for Development) in the training workshops who then assumes responsibility for ongoing community wellbeing goal setting and new business development;Partnering with a local University with the view to building their social entrepreneurship curriculum which includes ongoing student projects in the Lobitos community;Ongoing direct community training facilitated through us and the partner NGO and University. 
WHY INVEST IN US?We have received specialist postgraduate training in how to link entrepreneurship and community wellbeing for marginalized communities. We are skilled in:
Teaching to low education communities in Latin America;
Knowledge of community wellbeing and its measurement;
Knowledge of entrepreneurship training.

Aull in 1971, treats students as individuals, in an atmosphere where they are free to do their very best, free from excessive competition with their peers, and free from the fear of failure.Open Fields in the WorldOpen Fields students have attended colleges and universities including Bard, Bowdoin, Clemson, Cornell, Hampshire, Mount Holyoke, Smith, the Sorbonne, Stanford, UNH, UVM, Vassar, Wellesley, and more. But more importantly, they have gone on to create lives that are meaningful to them and to the world - as engineers, farmers, actors, environmentalists, dancers, social workers - often citing Open Fields as crucial in their development.The Open Fields School buildingThis school building - formerly a harness shop, residence, and post office - is in a harsh New England environment, where the cold winters, snow, wind, rain, and sun have worked their way through the wood: Our exterior staircase was getting rickety; the window sills and clapboards on the back wall of the school were decaying; one sill, buried by winter after winter of snow, and spring after spring of wet rains, has rotted and needs replacing; and the roof, which has kept snow and rain out of the building for many a year, may not last much longer!Project Expenses

Replace exterior stairs/porch/access to third floor: $4,500


Replace 8 windows on the east side of the building, replace siding as necessary, repair rot at the roofline: $7,500


Replace rotted sill on the north side of the building: $5,500


Remove and replace shingles on the roof, repairing any damage: $7,500

I live with my wife and our 1yo son.<br/><br/>I started university when I was 19, and I had a nervous breakdown 3 months in. I failed university, ran out of money, and found out I was pregnant. I assumed I'd never be able to go back.<br/><br/>This year I went out on a limb and applied to do the course I've wanted to do since a child, Archaeology and Anthropology at Manchester. I got an unconditional offer. I dared to dream of a way to support my family, despite being severely disabled, and then Student Finance dashed those dreams again.<br/><br/>I now have an unholy number of diagnoses. I have Major Depressive Disorder, Generalised Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, Joint Hypermobility Syndrome, Hypermobility, Chronic Fatigue, and a series of gastrointestinal problems caused by these other conditions and the medications I take for them. I am a wheelchair user and can't walk more than 50 metres. Because of how disabled I am, my wife is my full-time carer. She cannot work, and as such we live off a variety of state benefits designed to support families in our position. We have nothing left over at the end of the month – the safety net of the benefit state is hanging precariously low to the ground.<br/><br/>Student Finance have decided not to award me a tuition fee loan for this year. I have two years of funding remaining with them, but they are only willing to fund years 2 and 3 of my course. Their basis for this is the (incredibly ableist) assumption that I may, again, be thwarted by disability and then they'd have spent more money on me. I have appealed their decision, again and again, but they refuse to listen.<br/><br/>They have also assessed me as needing a £3,000 maintenance grant, but have since stripped me of it and sent me a bill for £800 to make up for my maintenance grant from the year I was 19. This is not money I have, and will make going to university incredibly difficult.<br/><br/>One of the ways to gain funding back is to prove that my previous failure was the result of ill health. Unfortunately, thanks to the horrible GP that I had at the time, my records are missing. I spent an hour going through them with my current GP. I sent them every piece of evidence I had, and they've declared it inadequate.<br/><br/>I'm supposed to be starting University, with appropriate support for the first time, in a month. At this rate, I will have to cut my losses on equipment deposits, books, and hope, and simply say I cannot afford to go and have the life I have dreamed about. I am so scared that I will lose any chance of this opportunity thanks to bureaucracy and ableism. My health is plummeting with the worry of it all. Everything hinges on this.<br/><br/>If you've been following the updates on our situation, you'll also know that in two weeks we will be homeless, as our landlady has discovered that we're gay and is now refusing to renew our lease. We have tried appealing to the council for housing, but they have blocked us at every turn – despite having had our application for over eight weeks, they still haven't assessed us as being eligible for help. We are going to have to leave the area that I know and love, that I grew up in, where I can see my mother's house from my front door, and move to an area where I will be terrified to step outside, simply because they are the only place that will take us.<br/><br/>There are so many stresses pressing down on us at the moment, that this is the only way I can see forward. If everyone who follows me on Twitter were able to chuck in a fiver, then I'd be able to pay my fees for this year. I wouldn't have to give up my dream. Even if they weren't, the more I'm able to get, the more likely I might be to persuade charities or the university to make up the rest.<br/><br/>The target here represents a replacement of the money that Student Finance have denied me for being disabled. If we can reach it, I can go to university. That would, at the moment, be more than I could ever imagine.<br/><br/>Any money raised in excess of this, tbh, is beyond my comprehension, but if the unthinkable occurs, it will go towards paying for my specialist equipment, my powerchair and our dire housing situation.<br/><br/>Thank you so much for even reading this.</p></div>","Hi.

<p>and I believe that putting a home cooked meal on the table as often as possible is one of the best and most affordable ways to prevent disease. Plus, it makes you really happy and proud, to boot!</p>
<p>  I've been doing this for a while now, and the key is having confidence to cook at home with simple ingredients. Not only is it vastly more beneficial for your health, but it's a big money saver compared to eating out or on the fly. A recipe doesn’t have to be fancy or made with a huge number of ingredients. Honestly, it doesn’t! It just needs to be real food.  Plain and simple, real food tastes good and doesn't need much, if any, preparation to get there. For many years, I'd start my cooking classes by saying, “This will be easy, delicious, and nutritious.”</p>   My desire to educate has reached an all-time high as diseases like obesity, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, Autism, ADHD, Alzheimer’s, cancer, colitis (its goes on and on) impact our country and the planet. I’m 41, and already I have way too many friends dealing with serious health conditions. Many of you know how personal it is for me, and I’m guessing that you, too, have a story of disease somewhere in your life right now.</div>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448381422/suhljx4q9ovjcbydowke.png"" src="""" style=""width: 630.319px; height: 128px;""/></p>
<p>   I’ve decided to produce a television show called YUM YUM about cooking and lifestyle. It’s going to be a lot of fun, because if it isn’t enjoyable, you just ain't gonna do it! We’re going to get your kids in the kitchen, liberate their hijacked taste buds, and demonstrate the power of food as fuel. </p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448381597/empzgixvam1ofycdid5w.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>  So I’ll educate you on what the right foods are and where you can buy them. I’ll teach you how to prepare delicious meals efficiently, because I know how busy life can be. Building confidence in the kitchen will not only help you to reclaim your health, but will also allow you to experience the joy in preparing a home cooked meal! </p>
<p>  Additionally, I’ll introduce and interview nutrition experts who can help us to sort out the incredible number of opinions and approaches that exist. I want to support your effort to help you form your own belief system about what’s best for you and your family, because you need to believe in what you’re doing in order to be successful. That goes for anything in life, not just food.</p>

<h3>MY MISSION</h3>
<p>I am committed to repopulating the kitchens of America. Cooking has become a lost life skill and I'm going to teach it, in a fun way, to as many people as possible! Together we'll assume responsibility for our own health by preparing real food for ourselves and our families. I'll show you how combining a healthy diet and lifestyle are the key to prevention.  Let's ditch the fear and rebuild our confidence in the kitchen! You'll love being back in the kitchen with me...EASY NUTRITIOUS AND DELICIOUS!</p>

<p></p>
<br/><p>In 2013 Hilary co-authored the best selling cookbook, ""The Heal Your Gut Cookbook"". A must have guide for those healing their guts through The GAPS Diet. The book chronicles Hilary's journey in healing herself and her family with food. It is now available in German and soon French and Spanish. </p>

<h3>WHAT AM I PRODUCING?</h3>
<p>Topics will include at least:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to practically cook nutrient dense food.</li>
<li>Traditional recipes from kitchens around the world.</li>
<li>Using food as medicine.</li>
<li>The important role of community and eating together.</li>
<li>Stories of health and healers.</li>
<li>Important steps to happiness outside the kitchen.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m planning a televised series of ‘cooking adventure’ shows, simply titled 'YUM YUM'. In each episode, we'll explore the delicious and healthy flavors of our nation's vibrant, multi‐cultural appetite. Some shows will be filmed from ‘the road’, others with a guest in my kitchen; all of them will feature a meal at the family table! <br/> <br/>It is a light‐hearted yet focused cooking series inspired by the overwhelming feedback I got from my cookbook. I continue to receive emails from around the world telling stories of healing through food alone. Likewise, I often hear from people who grew up outside the US and say that my recipes remind them of home, where native populations thrive with far less disease. And of course, I also hear stories of heartache and helplessness from people who are struggling to regain their health. My series will dig deep into these issues and explore the power of food as medicine.<br/> <br/>I am highly motivated by our country's staggering rates of chronic disease in children and adults. In fact, many of you know that the past couple of years have been focused on my family's own intense healing dietary protocols for treating illness. Now I am ready to do my part: to share what we've learned about nutrition, food prep, and most importantly, family togetherness, in hopes of helping others to avoid such 'diseases of civilization' as cancer. The more we can empower people to take control of their own health and make good choices, the better shot we have at a bright future for our children.<br/> <br/>Let’s face it. This country has more cooking shows, cooking magazines and better access to food than ever before, yet as a country we are cooking less and less. I want to show viewers that it’s fun to be in the kitchen, to source great foods, and to prepare meals for sharing at the family table, as was done for generations until very recently. My bottom line: buy the best quality ingredients that you can afford, and cook real food.</p>

<h3>HILARY BOYNTON - CREATOR &amp; PRODUCER</h3>
<p>Hilary Boynton, certified holistic health counselor, received a BA in psychology from the University of Virginia and was trained at the Institute for Integrative Nutrition. The devoted mother of five young kids, Hilary has seen the power of nutritional healing firsthand. Inspired by her own experience of ""food as medicine,"" she has dedicated herself to helping others on their path to wellness as a cook, coach, and professional educator. Hilary supports her clients by integrating ""Paleo"" and ""Primal"" philosophies with the wisdom of the Ancestral Health Movement and the Weston A. Price Foundation. Hilary is a Weston A. Price chapter leader, has run several local food co-ops, teaches cooking classes out of her house, and helped to open a farm-to-table restaurant in Concord, Massachusetts. She lives in Topanga, California with her family.</p>
<p>The success of her book, and the lessons she learned along the way, helped to fuel her new project. YUM YUM became a reality when she realized she just had to do more. The letters of pleas for help, from sick people all over the world, opened her eyes to this global problem of ill health. The passion and determination she has to empower people to take control of their own health and prevent disease is tireless. She and her family have battled many health issues themselves including cancer, epilepsy, infertility, eczema, and Alzheimer’s amongst others.</p>
<p>She understands what it’s like to be in the trenches. In talking with people from around the world, and listening to them recount the fond memories around the traditional foods they ate growing up, much the same as in her cookbook, she knew this information had to be shared. With a non-judgmental, non-threatening joi de vivre, Hilary travels and talks to the people who are doing things right and thriving. Uncovering not only the truths and mistruths, but the fun and pleasure of preparing a meal, she hopes to inspire people to get back in their kitchens and cook … simple, economical, real food.</p>
<h3>NICK BOYNTON - CREATOR &amp; PRODUCER</h3>
<p>Nick has worked in commercial real estate development and management for many years. He has also raised money for several start-up companies. In 2013 he was diagnosed with throat cancer which he treated for in Los Angeles. His cancer was a wake-up call because he knew he had lost control of his health. Ensuring he's around for the next 50 years is his chief goal and is now regaining his health. </p>
<p>He’s always been Hilary’s biggest fan and has witnessed her development over their 16 years of marriage. Nick has joined the team and wants to help others avoid the pain he has suffered and the risk of recurrence he now lives with. He can even cook a bit too but prefers not to follow recipes. </p>

<h3>MELISSA BOYCE - OWNER OF VOICE OF BOYCE</h3>Social Media Management</div>
<div>
<br/>
<p>Melissa has been in the field of advertising since 2009.  She has watched and learned as social media unfolded through the years from Myspace to SnapChat and everything in between. It has changed the way customers are obtained, relationships are built and brands are trusted. If you still think the point of social media is to post on your profile, then expect to see the same results as if you were on the corner handing out your business card. It's called social for a reason, the conversation matters. </p>

<h3>A SINCERE THANKS</h3>
<div>I am honestly humbled and so very grateful for all the support I have received even before the official launch of this campaign. I can't thank you all enough for jumping in and supporting me in all different ways, from cheering me on to spreading my mesage to making financial commitments.

<h3>PERKS &amp; REWARDS</h3>
<p>I spent a lot of time (outside the kitchen) researching the wide variety of Perks that have been offered in other campaigns. My ""product"" is EDUCATIONAL: having fun, sharpening your skills in the kitchen, improving your overall health, and in turn upgrading your lifestyle. This made it difficult to choose perks that you'd really appreciate and are eco friendly. I decided to keep it simple and offer perks that not only say thanks but are helpful in the kitchen, wearable, usable and/or educational. Your donations will allow me to realize my dream of improving your health and creating a brighter future for our children.  </p>
<div>Aside from cool t-shirts, hoodies, buttons, hanging with me at the farmer's markets and chit chatting on Skype we have some very cool other perks! Check out a few of our super exciting perks below!

</div></div>","America is the most OBESE country in the WORLD.

                           

OBESITY and its related diseases are NOW the #1 cause of death in the United States.                     

                 



Coincidentally, Americans are COOKING LESS. It requires TIME to shop and prepare...time we all think we don't have.                           
                  
Americans are either eating out or buying prepared foods, and every time we do this we put our health in someone else's control.                       

                   

Eating out is an option that's very hard to ignore.         Wouldn't you take an extra hour out of your day to prepare a home cooked meal if you knew it would prolong your life, prevent disease, improve your relationship with your kids and give them a brighter future?            

                                                  
                         


 

and I believe that putting a home cooked meal on the table as often as possible is one of the best and most affordable ways to prevent disease. Plus, it makes you really happy and proud, to boot!
  I've been doing this for a while now, and the key is having confidence to cook at home with simple ingredients. Not only is it vastly more beneficial for your health, but it's a big money saver compared to eating out or on the fly. A recipe doesn’t have to be fancy or made with a huge number of ingredients. Honestly, it doesn’t! It just needs to be real food.  Plain and simple, real food tastes good and doesn't need much, if any, preparation to get there. For many years, I'd start my cooking classes by saying, “This will be easy, delicious, and nutritious.”   My desire to educate has reached an all-time high as diseases like obesity, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, Autism, ADHD, Alzheimer’s, cancer, colitis (its goes on and on) impact our country and the planet. I’m 41, and already I have way too many friends dealing with serious health conditions. Many of you know how personal it is for me, and I’m guessing that you, too, have a story of disease somewhere in your life right now.

   I’ve decided to produce a television show called YUM YUM about cooking and lifestyle. It’s going to be a lot of fun, because if it isn’t enjoyable, you just ain't gonna do it! We’re going to get your kids in the kitchen, liberate their hijacked taste buds, and demonstrate the power of food as fuel. 

  So I’ll educate you on what the right foods are and where you can buy them. I’ll teach you how to prepare delicious meals efficiently, because I know how busy life can be. Building confidence in the kitchen will not only help you to reclaim your health, but will also allow you to experience the joy in preparing a home cooked meal! 
  Additionally, I’ll introduce and interview nutrition experts who can help us to sort out the incredible number of opinions and approaches that exist. I want to support your effort to help you form your own belief system about what’s best for you and your family, because you need to believe in what you’re doing in order to be successful. That goes for anything in life, not just food.
I want to be a catalyst for change, and I deeply appreciate your support in helping me to reach this goal.
Rememeber: few ingredients, easy steps, and amazing results.
Let's get started, America! 
See you in the kitchen




MY MISSION
I am committed to repopulating the kitchens of America. Cooking has become a lost life skill and I'm going to teach it, in a fun way, to as many people as possible! Together we'll assume responsibility for our own health by preparing real food for ourselves and our families. I'll show you how combining a healthy diet and lifestyle are the key to prevention.  Let's ditch the fear and rebuild our confidence in the kitchen! You'll love being back in the kitchen with me...EASY NUTRITIOUS AND DELICIOUS!

MELISSA BOYCE - OWNER OF VOICE OF BOYCESocial Media Management


Melissa has been in the field of advertising since 2009.  She has watched and learned as social media unfolded through the years from Myspace to SnapChat and everything in between. It has changed the way customers are obtained, relationships are built and brands are trusted. If you still think the point of social media is to post on your profile, then expect to see the same results as if you were on the corner handing out your business card. It's called social for a reason, the conversation matters. 



UPDATED RODUCTION BUDGET 11.23.15

The goal of this Indiegogo campaign is to produce one half hour pilot episode of YUM YUM, as well as a 1-2 minute sizzle reel, which will then be marketed to the many media outlets who are always looking for good content.$60,000 Total Budget 
Funds received after the goal is reached will enable us to travel further and expedite brand development and production.


A SINCERE THANKS
I am honestly humbled and so very grateful for all the support I have received even before the official launch of this campaign. I can't thank you all enough for jumping in and supporting me in all different ways, from cheering me on to spreading my mesage to making financial commitments. It's all amazing and so incredibly awesome! I promise we will have a wild ride! Remember it's all about FUN and it's all about YUM!  
                             




PERKS & REWARDS
I spent a lot of time (outside the kitchen) researching the wide variety of Perks that have been offered in other campaigns. My ""product"" is EDUCATIONAL: having fun, sharpening your skills in the kitchen, improving your overall health, and in turn upgrading your lifestyle. This made it difficult to choose perks that you'd really appreciate and are eco friendly. I decided to keep it simple and offer perks that not only say thanks but are helpful in the kitchen, wearable, usable and/or educational. Your donations will allow me to realize my dream of improving your health and creating a brighter future for our children.  
Aside from cool t-shirts, hoodies, buttons, hanging with me at the farmer's markets and chit chatting on Skype we have some very cool other perks! Check out a few of our super exciting perks below! What a great way to give back and cross off a few holiday gifts at the same time!",42.0,1,"1 Campaign

grew to include boat builders, rowers, sailors, wood workers and other enthusiasts.  We work out of a floating

families or moved away there were only a few old timers keeping it alive.<span>  2013 brought new members to the club.  We now have the energy but are short on funds
to start our next project. </span></p>
<p>We want to build a 12 foot
Providence River boat in order to have another row boat that sails.  This was a boat documented by Howard Chapelle and built in 1875 by a man named Button Swan. It was once
 common at the head of Narragansett Bay, near Providence, Rhode Island. 
 The original boat was commonly used for crab fishing. It featured a 
live well and carried a huge gaff rig. The boat would be 12’ 4” long 
with a beam of 5’ 3”.  It’s got an unstayed cat rig with an optional head sail (jib).  The traditional type of building would be Lapstrake (Clinker) planks on steam bent hardwood frames (ribs).<span></span></p>
<p><span>
</span></p>
<p><b>This project will:</b></p>
<p><span>1.<span> 
</span></span>not only replace
one of our older boats but also provide a boat for members and their children to sail<br/></p>
<p><span>2.<span> 
</span></span>provide an
opportunity for our members to build a boat in a very traditional way</p>
<p><span>3.<span>

</div></div>","Short Summary

                                                     The boat we want to build....12' Providence River Boat 

Oarlock and Sail Wooden Boat
Club was started 20 years ago by two women who wanted to build their own
boats.  As the years went by the club
grew to include boat builders, rowers, sailors, wood workers and other enthusiasts.  We work out of a floating
workshop we built at the Maritime Museum’s Heritage Harbour Dock in Vancouver, BC.  
The club has built and
restored several boats over the years including:                         7’ Fancy Pram, 9’ Gartside
Pram, 12’ Gartside Riff, 16’ Derry Carter lapstrake rowboat, 12’ Vogler
Brothers clinker-built and a 12’ Richard
Kolin Heidi design.
                                                                                                         The Gartside Riff ""Ragna""
As members got older, had
families or moved away there were only a few old timers keeping it alive.  2013 brought new members to the club.  We now have the energy but are short on funds
to start our next project. 
We want to build a 12 foot
Providence River boat in order to have another row boat that sails.  This was a boat documented by Howard Chapelle and built in 1875 by a man named Button Swan. It was once
 common at the head of Narragansett Bay, near Providence, Rhode Island. 
 The original boat was commonly used for crab fishing. It featured a 
live well and carried a huge gaff rig. The boat would be 12’ 4” long 
with a beam of 5’ 3”.  It’s got an unstayed cat rig with an optional head sail (jib).  The traditional type of building would be Lapstrake (Clinker) planks on steam bent hardwood frames (ribs).


This project will:
1. 
not only replace
one of our older boats but also provide a boat for members and their children to sail
2. 
provide an
opportunity for our members to build a boat in a very traditional way
3. 
members will learn how to use
tools and wood building skills
4.  carry on the Maritime heritage in Vancouver                                




Funds for this project are needed for:
·  wood
·  rigging
·  shipping

When I joined the IEC of Hamilton

Beyond the curriculum and
mentorship of the program, it is the inspiring of confidence and resilience in
the young minds of Hamilton that is at the core of what Mighty does. In a time
of such uncertainty there is no better gift than to instill in the next generation
than everything entrepreneurship can bring into a life. 
It is the intention of this
campaign to stoke the flames of youth entrepreneurship to bring the MIGHTY
Program into a 3rd successful year of operation. 


   What We Need & What You Get 
Despite Mighty's past success The
government has reallocated funds and is no longer supporting their Youth
Entrepreneurship Partnerships model from which MIGHTY received its funding. Our goal
is to raise $10,000.00 to maintain the operational cost of providing and coordinating
MIGHTY.
Funds raised will go to:
· 
Providing over 40 after school entrepreneurial
sessions across both Hamilton school boards
· 
Operation costs required to facilitate sessions
and coordinate volunteers/contributors
· 
Transportation (bus tickets) required by
participating students who may otherwise been unable to attend sessions
·

</p><p><b>Who
we are</b></p>
<p>We are a group of educators that have
come together to seek ways of helping economically marginalized groups, such as
women and the youth, earn a living. We seek and implement innovative approaches, which help people who have completely no source of livelihood. We are currently
conducting a life skills training programme in school to help reduce pregnancy
cases and retain girls in school. </p>
<p><b>Why Kisii girls</b></p>
<p>One of the
obstacles for women empowerment in Kenya is lack of sound education and training.
This stems from school dropout at a tender age due to pregnancy. Kisii County,
with 17.3% of its residents having obtained secondary education (Commission of
revenue, 2011), has one of the high school dropout rates of girls in Kenya.
Socio-cultural practices and domestic roles make women and girls spend their
time doing household chores. Often, due to poverty and lack of knowledge on
reproductive health, girls conceive shortly after another pregnancy.We endeavor, through the life skills programme, to educate girls to avoid pregnancy and foster the re-admission into school of the girls who have dropped out due to pregnancy related cases.<br/></p>
<p><b>Why we need your contribution</b></p>
<p>Besides the life
skills programme which aims at retaining girls in school, we are intending to
rehabilitate dropouts and help them resume school. For those who will not be
re-admitted, we will help them learn a handwork training of their choice that
can help them find a source of income. We now need to build a room that will be
used as a seminar and training room for these girls. The seminar room will
remain as an initiative to start a girl’s cultural centre, for networking and
motivating the girls. The site for construction has been donated and we are now
seeking to raise money for materials and the construction work.The seminar room accessories and furniture have been provided by a women and girls grant that we were awarded. Your contribution will help us find shelter to realize the goal of this project.<br/></p>
<p>These are girls from
families that are already burdened with other children to provide for. It is an
added burden for the parents to take care of the children of their children.
Your contribution will help us send the girls back to school, give them
training that they can use to earn a living and give them life skills that will
help them take control of their lives.</p><p><b>Other contributions</b></p><p>Thank you for taking time to read this and having interest on our project. Your contribution of any kind are greatly appreciated. In case you are not able to give monetary contribution, your time as a volunteer to motivate, mentor and and be part of the life skill training activities will be a precious gift to us.
