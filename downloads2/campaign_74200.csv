For we fought brother against brother, and we gave our very lives to God, to this blessed and promised land, and to you, our posterity, that you might realize and embrace the truths and freedoms the Lord your God has won for you, even by the shedding of our blood upon the earth! Yea, we did give our all, that we might break the bonds of sin and death forever, through Jesus Christ, and be forgiven of our sins and rise above the wickedness of the world!</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">     And not long after this great and terrible war in the new land and against evil on every side, we having achieved our mighty purpose through the majestic power and grace of God, many did turn their hearts from God and from His beloved Son, Jesus Christ, and did forget the miraculous blessings of freedom and liberty, won by their Creator, Redeemer, and Savior.  And they turned back their hearts to the world and to their old ways, and did follow after the wicked lusts of their hearts; falling back into temptation and the captivity of the adversary.  </p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">     For Satan places all manner of evil thoughts in the hearts and minds of the children of men to both confuse and frustrate men, so they forget the Lord their God and His blessings and commandments, and to cause us to change our righteous desires and sacred dreams to selfishness, greed, and dominion over others, and over all things in the earth.  Thus, many were deceived, and the same wicked practices and patterns of our motherlands began to take root upon this land, and in the hearts of God’s free children.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">     We plead unto to you to see with your spiritual eyes the truth of all God’s words unto the discovery of evil schemes and the wicked captivity of the adversary.  Yea, we say to all God’s children in the earth, choose ye the better part, even the gospel of Jesus Christ, and perform the duties therein, and be saved!  We, who have lived upon this earth, and who have died and returned to our maker, know of a certainty, that God is the Eternal Father, and that Jesus is the living Christ.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">     Now the Lord must set His hand again and tend to His vineyard, to purify His people, and tear down what Satan and wicked men hath built up.  Nevertheless, there is a way prepared, by the Lord, for you to come unto Him and receive His salvation.  It is to repent now of your wicked ways, tear down your false gods, and idols, and things of the world, and turn your hearts, now, to the Lord and His teachings.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">     To you our descendants we all say together to heed the words of Christ!  Praise the name of God and give all glory to Him for your lives, your freedoms, and agency.  And choose to seek the Kingdom of God and to establish it upon the earth.  Serve not yourselves but God only, and fulfill all righteousness and all the commandments of Him who is mighty to save!</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">     The example is set for you by the Savior of the world how to keep the commandments of God and maintain the freedom of this land unto your souls.  Do as the Lord has commanded: lift up the poor and lowly in spirit; feed the hungry, and go in unto the sick and afflicted and bless them; mourn with those that mourn, and lighten the burden of others, through love and compassion; and bring many unto Christ, through repentance and humility and the waters of baptism, that may be numbered with His flock, and may also be called His people.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">     Impart of your substance, freely, even your time, talents, and abundance; and see that ye clothe the naked, and give shelter to those who are without; that there might not be any poor, or hungry, or bond among you.  And if ye shall do all these things, ye shall avoid the bondage and captivity of the adversary, and the Lord will pour out His blessings upon you, that you shall not have room enough to receive them!</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">     We are thy kindred, and we didst go forth to prepare the way for your coming, and to set a corrupt world straight and just, that you might live in this blessed land and maintain the righteous laws of the Lord, that you might not be compelled nor corrected, and that you would remain chaste, and not be chastened by the Lord.  We speak with one accord and say that we have fought the good fight and have conquered Satan in our time, and we know that through the grace of God you can do likewise, if ye will but be wise and seek Christ, the Savior of the world, the Savior of us all, for He is the only way, the truth, the light, and the life of the world, and we confess it before thee from beyond the veil in heaven and from the dust of the earth to which you shall all return.  </p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">     And we say these things to you, not to trouble your hearts, but as the voice of warning, to cause you to ponder in your hearts the words of Jesus Christ, and to follow Him.  If you will look to the Savior and to none other for the answers, He will come in unto you, to your heart, and tell you that all these things are true and must be done, for God our Father in heaven commands it, that He may fit us for His kingdom and immortality and eternal life!</p><p>     Upon deep consideration of all these things in my heart it is clear to me that the American dream of our early ancestors was not a dream of temporal things, but that of the spiritual, and of the soul.  Their hearts were transfixed upon the salvation of God and they desired deliverance from the spiritual bondage and captivity of their souls, even deliverance from sin within and from the sins of others or the world without, that they might achieve and obtain complete and perfect, spiritual freedom in this life, as well as in the eternities to come!</p><p>     And they exclaim that it is still, and must remain, the true dream of America and of American hearts today!  For they did study the word of the Lord and it became their heart and soul.  The word showed them the errors of their ways, and they looked to Christ, in hope and faith, for forgiveness of sin, and for the deliverance and redemption of their souls.  </p><p>     They knew that Christ’s words could set them free from the pains of sin within and from the buffetings of Satan.  For their hearts were turned to their fathers even the holy prophets, and they remembered the blessings of the Lord to their fathers, and they humbled their hearts and received guidance and direction through the Spirit of the Lord.  They found strength in the Lord, and through Him they did escape the woes of sin and captivity.</p><p>     They followed the same pattern as our ancestors of old, to repent and give up their sins, their old traditions, and their old ways, to become new creatures in Christ and apply His attributes of love and charity, and all virtues of righteousness and heavenly power, unto themselves.  And as they did so they found a love for God, country, and their fellow man that was equal to the love they had for their families and their own lives, thus fulfilling the two greatest commandments of the gospel.  And they understood the truth that God made all men equal and made man to be free, and they were prepared to give their very lives in defending that truth.  They believed in God and they knew he would deliver them.</p><p>     As I consider their great faith in the Lord and their sacrifices, the voice of our forbears is joined by those who have gone before them even the prophets, apostles, and disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ, and all who have come to this earth and who have gone on to the next world do solemnly unite their voice together with our patron saints once again in declaring the truth to my heart, saying: Hosanna, to God and the Lamb, for God’s glorious plan of salvation, happiness, and redemption, and for the gift of His Son, our Savior and Redeemer, Jesus Christ! For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called, Wonderful, Counselor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">     It is He, the Lord, Jesus Christ that has made it possible for us to receive our exaltation, resurrection, and the glory of God, and to sit down in their presence even at this time and rejoice for all eternity, and to turn our hearts to you and reach out to the children of God in the earth, as you turn your hearts and minds to us.  We, even all the hosts of heaven, look upon the inhabitants of the earth, and plead with you to repent and come unto Christ.  Learn from us, learn from our mistakes, our experiences, our triumphs and successes in the Lord.  And know this, that your life is not your own, and is but a time and season to prepare to meet God; that you might obtain the grace of God, and of His only begotten Son, through the sacrifice of His Son, whom God the Father has given, for all the sins of the world.  </p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">     Forget, put aside, yea, cast off your own lusts, envies, and strifes, repent unto God through Christ, and sin not, but do the will of the Father even after the pattern and example set by Christ himself.  Step forward, before the world, and fulfill His plan of salvation, and ask God, “Where wouldst thou have me go, Father? What wouldst thou have me do that I may serve thee and give back all of my love unto thee for the gift of thy Son, that I might inherit eternal exaltation and behold thee and know thee, and come unto thee, and live with thee in thy presence?  And we His prophets and apostles do solemnly witness that God lives and Jesus the Christ also, and we share these things to strengthen you, to guide you, to help and to save you, and do so, for your sake, through Christ the Savior.</p><p>     And so on do the voices from the dust of the earth unite and come into my heart and soul and plead with me to share with all, their collective voice, their witness of the Lord. And as I ask myself and the Lord how did they do it?  How did they overcome the world, and to begin to put on the armour of the Lord, and serve thee wholeheartedly all their days? As I seek the Spirit and search the scriptures for the answers I hear the voice of the Lord, saying: I have set my people apart upon this promised land, for a wise purpose in me, and to work out their salvation and exaltation.  I do witness to thee and to the world that I did send my Spirit upon many to come to this land to be free, for there were many in bondage in other lands who cried out to me for forgiveness and deliverance.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">     I prepared this land from the beginning and have set it apart for my righteous chosen, and I gave unto them, and to all who come to this land, a promise, that if ye will keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land, and if ye keep not my commandments ye have no promise, and know that I am the same yesterday, today, and forever, and that I keep my promises.  And I send my Spirit to those who seek after righteousness in whatever lands they may be, and my Spirit leadeth them to promised lands and to stand in holy places.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">     I have set thee thee at liberty in this promised land with a covenant, and I have consecrated it for thy sake.  It is a choice land, choice above all others, and by the shedding of blood has this land been purchased for thee even the blood of thy brethren who did stand uprightly before me and before the world in righteousness.  And their faith was equal to it, that they did give their lives to serve their one true God, and gave up their lives for my cause and for thee.  </p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">     And after gathering my people to this land, I caused my people that they should declare before the world their faith and dependence in God unto deliverance, and I commanded them to fight for their freedom, and reassured them through my Spirit that I would lead the charge in this great cause of liberty and justice, for my righteous sake.  That I might set up a righteous nation unto myself and for the Gentiles, and fulfill the promises and covenants that I have made with their fathers.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">     And by the power of my Spirit, I inspired thy brethren to declare the truth, and to write these words, saying, “The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">     We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.  To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">     He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">     He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">     He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">     He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">     He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">     He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">     He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">     He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">     He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">     He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">     He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">     He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">     He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">     For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">     For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">     For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">     For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">     For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">     For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">     For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">     For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">     For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">     He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">     He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">     He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty &amp; perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">     He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">     He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">     In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">     Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">     We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.”</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">     For I have decreed that this land shall be a land of inheritance and a land of liberty unto the Gentiles.  And I have also decreed that there shall be no kings upon the land unto the Gentiles, and I will fortify this land against all other nations, and he that fighteth against Zion shall perish.  And any king raised up against me shall perish, for I the Lord, the king of Heaven, will be their king, and a light unto those that hear my words.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">     Their cause was just before me, for it is my cause, to save the righteous sons and daughters of God from the wickedness of the world, insomuch, as they will repent and come unto me with full purpose of heart.  Yea, I have purchased thee and this land by their blood, to set it apart, and consecrated it for righteous sake, even as the Father hath given me as a sacrifice for sin, to set men free.  I have purchased all of you through the shedding of mine own blood to pay the price of sin, the sins of all the world, even your sins.  I laid down my life for thee, and took it up again, that I might conquer death and bring forth the resurrection, for all who have lived and died in the world.  And I have done all these things to fulfill the laws and will of the Father .</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">     I sent forth my Spirit upon the founding fathers of this nation, to establish a righteous constitution, from which to govern this land, to maintain the freedoms purchased by the blood of your Savior and the blood and lives of true saints, and to declare it also by the inspiration of my Spirit, saying: “We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.”  And I caused my people to organize themselves and a government of their own which could only be possible if they were freemen in a free land.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">     And regarding the constitution and the interpretation thereof, it is a work brought about by my Spirit, for the children of men, to profit them thereby, first spiritually and second temporally, and thereby must be interpreted by my Spirit the same.  And it is given unto thee to assist the righteous in governing this land inasmuch as all citizens of the land obey its precepts in all diligence and humility.  And it is given unto thee according to my Spirit for the benefit of all upon this land equally, and to preserve freedom, righteousness, and the liberty of all the sons and daughters of God.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">     For the Lord doeth that which is good among the children of men; and he doeth nothing save it be plain unto the children of men; and he inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God, both Jew and Gentile.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">     And I sent forth my Spirit upon them in all instances that they could carry out the work of the Lord and bring about freedom and my gospel upon this land and build up my church.  And I helped them to conquer Satan who had great hold upon the hearts of their enemies. And they fought with bravery and with free hearts insomuch that they feared no man and no devil in this world, but they looked to God to seal up their faith and sanctify their souls unto salvation. For all this doth the Father require of His children, even a broken heart and contrite spirit.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">     And after the earth did rest for a time, I saw that it was a good nation, full of many good and humble souls.  A nation of nations, to be set up and set apart as a nation of righteousness, and to be an example to the world.  That other nations might see the goodness of the people upon the land who follow the commandments of God, and who love the Lord and one another.  That the nations of the world might be like this nation and cast off evil things, even Satan, and begin to follow the counsel of the Lord.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">     I the Lord saw that the season was right, to bring back to the earth, the fullness of my counsel, even the fullness of my gospel and my church.  Many had softened their hearts and humbled themselves and began to seek help from their Father above. And my Spirit wrought upon their souls to bring about a mighty change, and to help them keep in remembrance, that it was I that spared them, and it is I the Lord that suffered them to come to this place.  Remember, I am the truth and the life, no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.  And they began to see for themselves truth and cast off the philosophies of men and to seek answers from the Lord.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">     Yea, in a season, I scattered my people upon the face of the earth that they might remember the Lord their God, and the few who were righteous were scattered unto salvation and the wicked unto captivity.  And in my own due time will I gather them in and bring forth and fulfill all my promises to my people of the house of Israel, to fulfill the covenant I made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that the seed of Abraham would be blessed and receive the blessings of my gospel and eternal life through the Gentiles, even the people of this nation,</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">     These are the promises and covenants of the Lord made unto the children of Israel and unto Abraham.  All these whom hath spoken from the dust, yea, my prophets and apostles do so through my Spirit and speak from the dust of the earth through the words and holy scriptures and records which I caused them to write.  And the heavens above bear witness of me and of the Father and of these things to come and of all things that have come to pass for God’s children in all the earth and throughout all generations of man.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">     And my arm is stretched out still, to beckon to all, to come follow me, that I might gather all men unto me.  That they might obtain forgiveness of sin and freedom to their souls through my church and my gospel.  And in the early days of freedom and liberty in the land, I sent my Spirit unto a young boy of great faith, who lived among many who believed in me, and among many who wandered in disbelief.  And I brought him forth to be a prophet in the land, to act in my place, and to restore my church and the fulness of my gospel.  </p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">     His name is Joseph Smith, and he is like unto Joseph in Egypt, and the prophets, Moses and Abraham.  And I did cause him to bring forth a record of an ancient people who dwelt upon this land, who were brought forth out of Jerusalem, by my same spirit, before the destruction and scattering of my people, and before I the Lord, God, came into the world. An ancient people who are ancestors of the native americans, a remnant of the house of Jacob.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">     And they were a people given the same promise of prosperity and freedom upon this land, if they would live and establish a righteous nation unto me, that I might prepare them, also, for the kingdom of God, and prosper them in all their doings and in all their days upon the earth.  And I called upon my chosen prophets to proclaim my gospel of repentance and baptism, and to bear record of me to all generations, and to keep a record of their proceedings.  And the records were gathered together for my people that they might learn to chose good over evil and to worship God their Father in Heaven, and to turn from the temptations of Satan forever.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">     Nevertheless, they did multiply upon the earth and kept a record, and after many generations became wicked and idolatrous and forgot their God in Heaven and all things which He did for them.  And they did destroy one another until there was but a remnant of them left upon this land.  And the last prophet who was good and faithful, I caused to wander and write all that had transpired, and to keep and preserve and join all the records into one.  </p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">     And the name of the record is the Book of Mormon after the prophet Mormon, who lived in this promised land in ancient times.  And I caused Moroni, the the last of my prophets, and son of Mormon, to hide up the plates for a certain time of the Lord; to come before the children of men in latter-days; and to be joined with the records of mine ancient prophets, not of this fold.  And in all times and in all places have I caused records to be kept by my prophets, to witness to the world of my coming and my salvation, and to benefit the whole earth and all the inhabitants therein.  That they may learn the ways of the Lord, and keep the commandments and covenants of the Father; to one day come back into Our presence.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">     And in due time, I sent forth Moroni to show unto Joseph the records of my people upon this land.  And commanded my servant, Joseph, to translate the records and bring them forth unto the world, that my people might have the words of my chosen prophets in ancient times.  To show to the world the blessings they received by my hand for keeping the commandments, and the pains and wars and sufferings they experienced by their own hands, in times when they kept not my commandments.  And the record contains a history of a nation that was destroyed, and of a nation that dwelt here before them, which was utterly destroyed from off the face of this land, save their records only, because they would not keep my commandments, nor would they repent and turn unto me, nor turn from their abominations and works of darkness.</p><p>     And all these things doth the Lord speak and put into my heart, mind, and soul as I ask for more understanding and to know and understand the truth of His ways and of his purposes. And I think on and reflect upon the the experience of Joseph Smith.  And he adds his voice, and I hear the voice of Joseph Smith speak to my heart personally, saying: I was just a young boy but I knew in my heart that I had a love for God and for all men, and I wanted to serve God with all of my heart.  </p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">     I sought for truth and understanding and I found answers in the gospel of Christ, and I read from the words of James of the New Testament, first chapter, verse five, which reads, If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.  I understood it to mean that if I lacked wisdom I should ask of God directly and personally, and that He would teach me and answer my questions in the same way, directly, and personally.   I decided to follow the conviction in my heart, and determined to do as the scripture admonished, to ask God for wisdom and understanding.</p><p>     And I was about to share more of what Joseph experienced as he became the prophet of the Lord, Jesus Christ and His church in these latter-days, but I am constrained by the Spirit to invite you to seek out the words and witness of Joseph Smith for yourself, to seek out a missionary from this church and hear the account in person, and judge for yourself, through the Lord Spirit, of the truthfulness of Joseph Smith’s calling from the Lord; if he truly is the mouthpiece of the lord, for our benefit and for these latter-days.</p><p>     The spirit will guide you and tell you every needful thing and how one can give back to the Lord for all they have been given!  I thank God for my Savior Jesus Christ and for the prophet Joseph Smith!  Through him we have the fullness of the gospel and many more records of Jesus Christ and his teachings!  I can now study and learn the patterns, principles, and doctrines of service and salvation, and I will forever be grateful!</p><p>     With all of my heart I wish to continue on and share with you all of the things that I have learned through the Spirit of the Lord, His servants, the scriptures, the founding fathers, and serving in His church, but you can see that I can get carried away and talk forever about these things!  I have learned for myself the true dream within all of us!  We are here to work and follow our original dream in heaven to become perfect like our Father in Heaven.  And I know this is all possible through Christ the Lord!</p><p>     This is the reason for my desire to do more for the Lord and for creating this project and campaign.  I want to create for myself a business and organization that works for the Lord.  And it will allow me the opportunity to study His words further and to share them with all who desire to know the truth and realize true freedom in their hearts in this life and forever!  I want to build Zion, even a business worthy to be part of the Lord’s kingdom on earth!  </p><p>     And over the course of the last six months or so, the Lord has provided me with answers and a plan to realize these dreams and other desires of my heart: to lift up the poor and needy, to help people temporally as well, and to do my part and make contributions to the progress of the world somehow, even technologically using my background abilities!  So finally, now, I will try to paint a picture for you and explain as many of the details as I can regarding this inspiring plan or endeavor that I have received from the Lord!</p><p>     For starters, I am working with a small group of friends, and since we have taken upon us the name of Christ as members, we desire to do likewise as an organization, to show our faith and devotion in serving the Lord, and the direction of our endeavor.  The name of our organization is, Charity the Pure Love of Christ.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Charity the Pure Love of Christ</strong></p><p> </p><p>     We would like to share with you the fundamental or foundational principles of our organization to show that they are the driving force within us to bring this endeavor about because these principles are the source of our products and services, and become the actual products and services that we provide.</p><p>     First we desire to establish a righteous foundation; to continue to prove to God that it is a worthy endeavor, and that we are a faithful and trustworthy people to be authorized to use His name.  Second, to show to the world that we are a Christ centered business built up to the Lord, and we seek not our own, but to do the will of the Father!  We have adopted the same gospel principles in accordance with His church even The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and as members of the church we abide His laws and the laws of the land, even the laws of this great nation, the United States of America, first and foremost.</p><p>     From thence, we feel instructed to pattern the organization and our practices and procedures after the foundation of the city or civilization of Enoch and the Golden Rule.  We live the Golden Rule of Christ, or as it is found in Mathew chapter 7 verse 12: Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets. Moreover, throughout all of the ages and generations of the earth, no civilization has been perfect in keeping the Golden Rule and all of God’s commandments and covenants except for the people of the city of Enoch!  What a pattern and example to follow!</p><p>     Enoch was the son of Jared, and seventh Patriarch extending back to Adam.  He was born in a land of righteousness and promise like us!  He was called to proclaim repentance and baptism to the wicked that they might correct their ways or suffer destruction.  Many took offense to the word of the Lord, which he shared, and they opposed him and the Lord, and they called him wild.  However, some listened to him and followed his call to repentance and came unto the Lord.</p><p>     Through many mighty miracles Enoch and his followers triumphed over their enemies.  They were obedient and united in heart and mind and carried out the laws of Christ.  And through their service there was no poor among them and they realized economic equality.  This led to even great spiritual unity and prosperity throughout their entire civilization.  The Lord poured out a multiplicity of blessings built them up as a City of Holiness, even Zion(or the kingdom of God, even Heaven on earth)!  They based their lives on the order and unity of Heavenly Father in the celestial kingdom, the highest glory.  And their civilization continued for 365 years and was received up into heaven to receive their eternal reward(save a small remnant which remained for a wise purpose in the Lord)!</p><p>     We want to give our best effort in establishing a Zion organization and see if we can achieve economic equality among us as the very least of our goals.  It seems like a tall order but that is the exciting part, to raise the bar and challenge ourselves to see greater goodness come into the world and actually correct the corruption of the world, through the power of truth and righteousness!  We are a group of Christians trying to provide a service that assists with the caring of the spiritual welfare of people throughout the world; the same mission of Jesus Christ.</p><p>     And in turn, one of the organization’s business proceedings is taking our beliefs, structure, or culture, if you will, and turning it into our product or services that we provide for other organizations and businesses throughout the world who may be looking for such things to improve their business for their people’s sake.  These services may be provided through counseling or consultation, for individuals, groups, or entire organizations and personnel; all inclusive.</p><p>     As one example of a service we provide, it can begin as simple as instructing one how to pray or a company how to incorporating gospel principles in the business such as: teaching the golden rule, offering a prayer at the beginning of the day or in meetings, or quick spiritual thought or quote, which will help bring in the Spirit of the Lord, and bring in focus and unity.  And who knows, such a thought or quote, or even a hymn, may help someone throughout the day or week, in some way, or in some aspect of their lives.</p><p>     In addition to the Golden Rule, we feel another foundational principle, that is a goal of ours to incorporate, is to follow the pattern of “laying up in store”. This is a principle that is not had among businesses of our day, but an example of it can be found in the Bible in the story of Joseph who was sold into Egypt.  Many are familiar with his story and how he was the beloved son of Jacob, who was called Israel, and he always did as his father instructed(another type or example of Christ).  His brother’s were jealous and sold Joseph as a slave to Potiphar of Egypt. Joseph loved God, however, and turned everything, no matter the difficulty, into something good, and I imagine he would be just as optimistic if he were alive today.  He was even thrown into prison for something he did not do.  He didn’t deserve any of it but took it in stride and kept the commandments of the Lord.  </p><p>     Then one day, he interprets the dream of Pharaoh, which no one else could do, through the power and gifts of God.  He tells Pharaoh the meanings of all the symbols in his dream and that they were the works of God which He would bring about soon upon the land.  There was to be seven years of plenty, to be followed by seven years of famine.  And the dream came with instructions of the Lord how to prepare in all things, which could only be interpreted by one with the Spirit and vision of the Lord.</p><p>     And Pharaoh was pleased with the words of Joseph and understood them; to lay up in store the fifth part of the grain of the land in the seasons of plenty to carry them through the seasons of famine that they might not perish, and so the Lord would preserve the house of Jacob also, and His chosen people.</p><p>     And we know that the Lord will come again but before the Lord comes there will be many changes great and terrible in the world including famines and pestilences and wars and rumors of wars, and we want to prepare for these things, moreover, we want to help you prepare yourself and your families and your friends; this is a part of the service we want to provide from our business to other businesses.  For in seasons of famine or disasters, those organizations that have not laid up in store for their people will find that there is no one in the land or in the office to work and move products or carry out the work and services of their business.</p><p>     And from the same story we learn that money failed in Egypt and they gave of their cattle for food, and next, their lands for food and seeds, that they might plant and grow food for their families, and continue to live in the land.  Could the currency of our day fail?  Yes, very easily in fact, especially as things become more and more digital.  When the lights go out what have ye? Hopefully you have laid up in store provisions for difficult times for you and your people.  Or perhaps we can help you prepare today!</p><p>     Another foundational principle is that of equal stewardship.  It is a principle our church thrives on and even the least of the many stewardships in every ward is no less serviceable than the other.  A good example of this is taught by the Savior himself, in the New Testament, in the parable of the servants of the vineyard. (Follow this link to see a video of the parable: <a href=""https://www.lds.org/bible-videos/videos/laborers-in-the-vineyard?lang=eng"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.lds.org/bible-videos/videos/laborer...</a>)</p><p>     It is not about the reward but the work and the agreement.  As we fulfill our work or stewardship, the Lord rewards us equally.  The focus in not of profit but of people, and sharing in the work of the Lord.  Consider the lilies of the field how they grow and toil not.  He is the great creator and redeemer and Savior of all.  We need but seek Him and His employ and He will provide for us temporally, and if we seek His words unto salvation He will put us to work in His vineyard and the work of the harvest, or saving souls, as we work as His disciples to feed His sheep spiritually and bring people to Christ.  And the Lord will always bless those who do His will, whether the blessings come in this life or in the next, they will always come, and are great indeed!</p><p>     And again this is what we desire for ourselves and desire to share with others, especially, those businesses looking to provide even further, in addition to laying up in store for their people, and in dividing equally the stewardship, the beloved work of the business, among their people, that all might profit thereby equally, and be rich in spirit also.</p><p>     One of the most difficult and challenging principles we have incorporated into the foundation of our business is that of consecration.  We must return to the first principle of the golden rule perfected by the people of Enoch for further understanding.</p><p>     They lived the commandments with exactness and consecrated everything to the Lord and to each other!  This means that they recognized and understood that the Lord provided everything for them both temporally and spiritually and they sacrificed all back to God and for one another. Consecration is the highest order and to put it into perspective it simply means to share all that God has given equally with each other and in order!  It is so simple yet so profound and amazing!  And it can be done within a Christ centered business.  One that is truly established upon the gospel of Christ and in all its practices and through all of the members of the business who are also established in Christ and His doctrine, wholeheartedly, and understand their stewardship.</p><p>     The great beauty of consecration is that the focus is united and hearts are stitched together for the sake of Zion and God’s Kingdom!  It strengthens the faith of all, and lifts up the poor and the needy, and humbles the rich or proud; and all things become common among the people. Moreover each person will give and receive equally, meaning that each has ownership of the business of Zion and all share the stewardships and responsibilities.</p><p>     And likewise it is our greatest desire to share this principle, law, and challenge with other businesses and organizations to help them achieve the greatest blessings a Christ centered business can achieve even that of shared ownership and celestial consecration and glory!</p><p>     And last but not the least, we are to serve and volunteer throughout the world and this has taken from in our company as foundational branches we are calling Charity, Freedom, and Volunteer Centers!  We want to establish these centers in places where people gather to shop, dine, or find entertainment; places of high traffic so we can be among our brothers and sisters and be and outlet for help if needed!</p><p> </p><p><strong>Charity, Freedom, &amp; Volunteer Center</strong></p><p> </p><p>     This is the most exciting part, and is the main part of the organization and of giving back!  It is an actual facility or center that will help us interact, as the Savior did during His ministry, one on one and face to face in our towns, cities, and communities, with anyone and everyone who is looking for assistance!  We are disciples of Christ after all, and it is our calling as members of His church to be missionaries everyone, and to share the gospel with our fellow man and brothers and sisters in the world.  We cannot move forward in our hopes of eternal progression and applying Christlike attributes to our souls without service! The missions of the church include: Preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ, Perfecting the Saints, Redeeming the Dead, and Caring for the Poor and Needy, and we can establish these centers as an additional source in carrying out the missions of the Lord!</p><p>     We want to do this everyday with the main focus being spiritual freedom and spiritual guidance for all!  We want to create small establishments that provide these things for free and help those who see and feel the captivity of the adversary find deliverance and spiritual liberty,  through the principles, parables, teachings, and truths of the gospel, through the words and works of Christ! </p><p>     By small and simple things are great things brought to pass!  The Centers focus on these small and simple things, even prayer and scripture study.  These two things are some of the most effective tools we can offer and that we can use to bring the Spirit into our lives and the lives of others, and it is by the Spirit that mighty changes can come about in our lives!  And they must be done daily that the changes may be everlasting!</p><p>     Our spirits are the most sensitive things in the world, and they need to communicate with the Spirit of our Lord in order to maintain their spiritual strength and integrity.  Prayer provides the way to communication to our Heavenly Father the desires of our hearts.  And we can tell him anything and ask for things we need.   He knows us and loves us, and I know and promise that He hears and answers every sincere prayer according to His will and timing.</p><p>     And often times the Lord will answer our prayers through the scriptures and the words and experiences of prophets of old.  And the scriptures become His way of communicating to us his answers and instructions that we might find what we need.  And sometimes He answers prayers through others or small daily miracles.  And so these and many other principles are the curriculum, service, and charity that our business and these Centers provide, and to feast upon the word of the Lord all the day long each and every day!</p><p>     Another initiative of the Centers and the foundation, Charity the Pure Love of Christ, is to establish a place of spiritual education.  A place where we can share with people who are looking for help in overcoming anything that may be hindering their freedom or to help move individuals from “I have a dream” for freedom to “I have a plan” for freedom.  And this is where your contributions come in, as we meet one on one with individuals or with families or groups who have spiritual dilemmas, we can provide them with examples of similar battles and struggles from your stories couple with the true stories of prophets and people in the scriptures.</p><p>     We know the Lord is able to help with any circumstance or situation because He knows that everyone faces adversity and that the adversary and his followers work hard to customize their traps for each of God’s children to make us slaves to our habits and appetites or to entice us with the riches of the earth or to steal, harm, enslave, or even destroy another’s life.  How does He know all the answers?  Because He performed the atonement in which He took upon himself the sins of all the world and suffered the pain and bitter anguish and full punishment of the law for all of us, for all of our misdeeds and wrongdoings.  And so Christ knows us better than we know ourselves, and has all of the answers and we want to present Him and His saving teachings to you to help you find freedom!</p><p>     These centers not only provide the spiritual nourishment and sustenance for each patron that comes in, but it also provides a much needed service opportunity for the brothers and sisters who work, serve, and volunteer there!  It is a center for edification of both or all individuals or groups involved including families and friends.  It can be a safe house from the storm.  If you are struggling with something you just can’t find answers to come to the charity center for help! Perhaps you feel downtrodden, depressed, or discouraged by all of the noise, negativity, and bullying in the world, and you would like to shake it off somehow.  We want to say, ""Come to the center, we are just down town or around the corner!  Or give us a call we want to listen, and we know His words will help!  For we are the humble recipients of Christ’s words and atonement, and we know He can help because He helps us each and every day!”</p><p>     Or perhaps you feel like doing a kind act or service that day.  Again, we say, “Come by and volunteer, and visit, and share with others the reason for your happiness and the reasons for your willingness to follow Him!”</p><p>     It’s not just about establishing spiritual safe havens in one place.  We want to build these centers up unto the Lord in all the world for all of God’s children and for Christ!  To help all in the world find freedom for their souls and their lands and connect the global family together.  To educate all about Christ and Heavenly Father and that we are all God’s children and one eternal family!</p><p>     If ever there is a spiritual crisis in you life or one you see in your family or friends lives we want to be your spiritual response team.  If we are not close, look to a nearby member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints(or LDS for short), or for a Mormon neighbor(our nickname) for anything you stand in need of, especially spiritual assistance, for that is our entire way of life! We go to church and live the gospel and prepare ourselves everyday to be ready to help!  We are your Christian brothers and sisters and we uphold the laws of the land and fight for the title of liberty and truth throughout the world, and we stand together forever against evil and Satan.</p><p>     If you seek us out and we aren’t able to help or be the good Samaritan you need then look for another and give us a second and perhaps even a third chance to prove our worth!  The Lord has prepared someone near you that will help, I promise!  Sometimes we get distracted by the world just like you, but we practice applying the atonement of Jesus Christ daily in our lives and He will not fail us and allow us to fail you.</p><p>     So come to us or let us come to you for anything, and we will work together with you and with the help of the Lord we will discover His answers and His solutions to any problem, question, or concern.  After all we are His Children and He loves us all.  God’s greatest desire is to helps us, and He does all He can to bring us back into His presence to one day give us rest from the cares of the world, and He hopes with all of His heart that we will hearken to the words of His beloved Son Jesus Christ, so He can provide us with every needful thing daily as we rely upon His Son. </p><p>     Service or volunteering is the healing spiritual power for the soul.  It is the next driving force of Americans and for all once and individual finds freedom to their souls.  It is the foundation of our church and missionary program and everyone is a volunteer in the church and it is how the work of the Lord moves forward.  Once we realize the dream of freedom it behooves us to get to work in obtaining it for ourselves or for others.  This is the same when one receives spiritual freedom, we are called by the Spirit to proclaim the everlasting power of forgiveness and where to find it!</p><p>     Remember the words of our former president John F. Kennedy who said, “And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you — ask what you can do for your country. My fellow citizens of the world: ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man.  Finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world, ask of us the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you. With a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that here on earth God's work must truly be our own.”</p><p>     Let us ask ourselves this question, ""What can I do for my country?"", moreover, we must ask ourselves, “What can I do for God?”.  If you ask with a sincere heart the answers will come to your heart and mind and the Lord will the answer, and He will say, “Feed my sheep.”  And we must do as we are instructed be it temporal or spiritual, and answer the call to serve wherever the Lord needs us.  Let us pledge our allegiance by stepping forward as volunteers and serving the poor and the needy, or strengthening the poor in spirit.</p><p>     I would love to continue to share all the possibilities of these centers, but the goal is to help even one person if we can!  To leave the ninety and nine and go after the one!  We want to know if you are interested in helping out or what you are already doing as volunteers and freedom fighters!

For we fought brother against brother, and we gave our very lives to God, to this blessed and promised land, and to you, our posterity, that you might realize and embrace the truths and freedoms the Lord your God has won for you, even by the shedding of our blood upon the earth! Yea, we did give our all, that we might break the bonds of sin and death forever, through Jesus Christ, and be forgiven of our sins and rise above the wickedness of the world!     And not long after this great and terrible war in the new land and against evil on every side, we having achieved our mighty purpose through the majestic power and grace of God, many did turn their hearts from God and from His beloved Son, Jesus Christ, and did forget the miraculous blessings of freedom and liberty, won by their Creator, Redeemer, and Savior.  And they turned back their hearts to the world and to their old ways, and did follow after the wicked lusts of their hearts; falling back into temptation and the captivity of the adversary.       For Satan places all manner of evil thoughts in the hearts and minds of the children of men to both confuse and frustrate men, so they forget the Lord their God and His blessings and commandments, and to cause us to change our righteous desires and sacred dreams to selfishness, greed, and dominion over others, and over all things in the earth.  Thus, many were deceived, and the same wicked practices and patterns of our motherlands began to take root upon this land, and in the hearts of God’s free children.     We plead unto to you to see with your spiritual eyes the truth of all God’s words unto the discovery of evil schemes and the wicked captivity of the adversary.  Yea, we say to all God’s children in the earth, choose ye the better part, even the gospel of Jesus Christ, and perform the duties therein, and be saved!  We, who have lived upon this earth, and who have died and returned to our maker, know of a certainty, that God is the Eternal Father, and that Jesus is the living Christ.     Now the Lord must set His hand again and tend to His vineyard, to purify His people, and tear down what Satan and wicked men hath built up.  Nevertheless, there is a way prepared, by the Lord, for you to come unto Him and receive His salvation.  It is to repent now of your wicked ways, tear down your false gods, and idols, and things of the world, and turn your hearts, now, to the Lord and His teachings.     To you our descendants we all say together to heed the words of Christ!  Praise the name of God and give all glory to Him for your lives, your freedoms, and agency.  And choose to seek the Kingdom of God and to establish it upon the earth.  Serve not yourselves but God only, and fulfill all righteousness and all the commandments of Him who is mighty to save!     The example is set for you by the Savior of the world how to keep the commandments of God and maintain the freedom of this land unto your souls.  Do as the Lord has commanded: lift up the poor and lowly in spirit; feed the hungry, and go in unto the sick and afflicted and bless them; mourn with those that mourn, and lighten the burden of others, through love and compassion; and bring many unto Christ, through repentance and humility and the waters of baptism, that may be numbered with His flock, and may also be called His people.     Impart of your substance, freely, even your time, talents, and abundance; and see that ye clothe the naked, and give shelter to those who are without; that there might not be any poor, or hungry, or bond among you.  And if ye shall do all these things, ye shall avoid the bondage and captivity of the adversary, and the Lord will pour out His blessings upon you, that you shall not have room enough to receive them!     We are thy kindred, and we didst go forth to prepare the way for your coming, and to set a corrupt world straight and just, that you might live in this blessed land and maintain the righteous laws of the Lord, that you might not be compelled nor corrected, and that you would remain chaste, and not be chastened by the Lord.  We speak with one accord and say that we have fought the good fight and have conquered Satan in our time, and we know that through the grace of God you can do likewise, if ye will but be wise and seek Christ, the Savior of the world, the Savior of us all, for He is the only way, the truth, the light, and the life of the world, and we confess it before thee from beyond the veil in heaven and from the dust of the earth to which you shall all return.       And we say these things to you, not to trouble your hearts, but as the voice of warning, to cause you to ponder in your hearts the words of Jesus Christ, and to follow Him.  If you will look to the Savior and to none other for the answers, He will come in unto you, to your heart, and tell you that all these things are true and must be done, for God our Father in heaven commands it, that He may fit us for His kingdom and immortality and eternal life!     Upon deep consideration of all these things in my heart it is clear to me that the American dream of our early ancestors was not a dream of temporal things, but that of the spiritual, and of the soul.  Their hearts were transfixed upon the salvation of God and they desired deliverance from the spiritual bondage and captivity of their souls, even deliverance from sin within and from the sins of others or the world without, that they might achieve and obtain complete and perfect, spiritual freedom in this life, as well as in the eternities to come!     And they exclaim that it is still, and must remain, the true dream of America and of American hearts today!  For they did study the word of the Lord and it became their heart and soul.  The word showed them the errors of their ways, and they looked to Christ, in hope and faith, for forgiveness of sin, and for the deliverance and redemption of their souls.       They knew that Christ’s words could set them free from the pains of sin within and from the buffetings of Satan.  For their hearts were turned to their fathers even the holy prophets, and they remembered the blessings of the Lord to their fathers, and they humbled their hearts and received guidance and direction through the Spirit of the Lord.  They found strength in the Lord, and through Him they did escape the woes of sin and captivity.     They followed the same pattern as our ancestors of old, to repent and give up their sins, their old traditions, and their old ways, to become new creatures in Christ and apply His attributes of love and charity, and all virtues of righteousness and heavenly power, unto themselves.  And as they did so they found a love for God, country, and their fellow man that was equal to the love they had for their families and their own lives, thus fulfilling the two greatest commandments of the gospel.  And they understood the truth that God made all men equal and made man to be free, and they were prepared to give their very lives in defending that truth.  They believed in God and they knew he would deliver them.     As I consider their great faith in the Lord and their sacrifices, the voice of our forbears is joined by those who have gone before them even the prophets, apostles, and disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ, and all who have come to this earth and who have gone on to the next world do solemnly unite their voice together with our patron saints once again in declaring the truth to my heart, saying: Hosanna, to God and the Lamb, for God’s glorious plan of salvation, happiness, and redemption, and for the gift of His Son, our Savior and Redeemer, Jesus Christ! For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called, Wonderful, Counselor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.     It is He, the Lord, Jesus Christ that has made it possible for us to receive our exaltation, resurrection, and the glory of God, and to sit down in their presence even at this time and rejoice for all eternity, and to turn our hearts to you and reach out to the children of God in the earth, as you turn your hearts and minds to us.  We, even all the hosts of heaven, look upon the inhabitants of the earth, and plead with you to repent and come unto Christ.  Learn from us, learn from our mistakes, our experiences, our triumphs and successes in the Lord.  And know this, that your life is not your own, and is but a time and season to prepare to meet God; that you might obtain the grace of God, and of His only begotten Son, through the sacrifice of His Son, whom God the Father has given, for all the sins of the world.       Forget, put aside, yea, cast off your own lusts, envies, and strifes, repent unto God through Christ, and sin not, but do the will of the Father even after the pattern and example set by Christ himself.  Step forward, before the world, and fulfill His plan of salvation, and ask God, “Where wouldst thou have me go, Father? What wouldst thou have me do that I may serve thee and give back all of my love unto thee for the gift of thy Son, that I might inherit eternal exaltation and behold thee and know thee, and come unto thee, and live with thee in thy presence?  And we His prophets and apostles do solemnly witness that God lives and Jesus the Christ also, and we share these things to strengthen you, to guide you, to help and to save you, and do so, for your sake, through Christ the Savior.     And so on do the voices from the dust of the earth unite and come into my heart and soul and plead with me to share with all, their collective voice, their witness of the Lord. And as I ask myself and the Lord how did they do it?  How did they overcome the world, and to begin to put on the armour of the Lord, and serve thee wholeheartedly all their days? As I seek the Spirit and search the scriptures for the answers I hear the voice of the Lord, saying: I have set my people apart upon this promised land, for a wise purpose in me, and to work out their salvation and exaltation.  I do witness to thee and to the world that I did send my Spirit upon many to come to this land to be free, for there were many in bondage in other lands who cried out to me for forgiveness and deliverance.     I prepared this land from the beginning and have set it apart for my righteous chosen, and I gave unto them, and to all who come to this land, a promise, that if ye will keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land, and if ye keep not my commandments ye have no promise, and know that I am the same yesterday, today, and forever, and that I keep my promises.  And I send my Spirit to those who seek after righteousness in whatever lands they may be, and my Spirit leadeth them to promised lands and to stand in holy places.     I have set thee thee at liberty in this promised land with a covenant, and I have consecrated it for thy sake.  It is a choice land, choice above all others, and by the shedding of blood has this land been purchased for thee even the blood of thy brethren who did stand uprightly before me and before the world in righteousness.  And their faith was equal to it, that they did give their lives to serve their one true God, and gave up their lives for my cause and for thee.       And after gathering my people to this land, I caused my people that they should declare before the world their faith and dependence in God unto deliverance, and I commanded them to fight for their freedom, and reassured them through my Spirit that I would lead the charge in this great cause of liberty and justice, for my righteous sake.  That I might set up a righteous nation unto myself and for the Gentiles, and fulfill the promises and covenants that I have made with their fathers.     And by the power of my Spirit, I inspired thy brethren to declare the truth, and to write these words, saying, “The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.     We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.  To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.     He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.     He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.     He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.     He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.     He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.     He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.     He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.     He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.     He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.     He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.     He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.     He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.     He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:     For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:     For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:     For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:     For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:     For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:     For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences     For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:     For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:     For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.     He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.     He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.     He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.     He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.     He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.     In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.     Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.     We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.”     For I have decreed that this land shall be a land of inheritance and a land of liberty unto the Gentiles.  And I have also decreed that there shall be no kings upon the land unto the Gentiles, and I will fortify this land against all other nations, and he that fighteth against Zion shall perish.  And any king raised up against me shall perish, for I the Lord, the king of Heaven, will be their king, and a light unto those that hear my words.     Their cause was just before me, for it is my cause, to save the righteous sons and daughters of God from the wickedness of the world, insomuch, as they will repent and come unto me with full purpose of heart.  Yea, I have purchased thee and this land by their blood, to set it apart, and consecrated it for righteous sake, even as the Father hath given me as a sacrifice for sin, to set men free.  I have purchased all of you through the shedding of mine own blood to pay the price of sin, the sins of all the world, even your sins.  I laid down my life for thee, and took it up again, that I might conquer death and bring forth the resurrection, for all who have lived and died in the world.  And I have done all these things to fulfill the laws and will of the Father .     I sent forth my Spirit upon the founding fathers of this nation, to establish a righteous constitution, from which to govern this land, to maintain the freedoms purchased by the blood of your Savior and the blood and lives of true saints, and to declare it also by the inspiration of my Spirit, saying: “We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.”  And I caused my people to organize themselves and a government of their own which could only be possible if they were freemen in a free land.     And regarding the constitution and the interpretation thereof, it is a work brought about by my Spirit, for the children of men, to profit them thereby, first spiritually and second temporally, and thereby must be interpreted by my Spirit the same.  And it is given unto thee to assist the righteous in governing this land inasmuch as all citizens of the land obey its precepts in all diligence and humility.  And it is given unto thee according to my Spirit for the benefit of all upon this land equally, and to preserve freedom, righteousness, and the liberty of all the sons and daughters of God.     For the Lord doeth that which is good among the children of men; and he doeth nothing save it be plain unto the children of men; and he inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God, both Jew and Gentile.     And I sent forth my Spirit upon them in all instances that they could carry out the work of the Lord and bring about freedom and my gospel upon this land and build up my church.  And I helped them to conquer Satan who had great hold upon the hearts of their enemies. And they fought with bravery and with free hearts insomuch that they feared no man and no devil in this world, but they looked to God to seal up their faith and sanctify their souls unto salvation. For all this doth the Father require of His children, even a broken heart and contrite spirit.     And after the earth did rest for a time, I saw that it was a good nation, full of many good and humble souls.  A nation of nations, to be set up and set apart as a nation of righteousness, and to be an example to the world.  That other nations might see the goodness of the people upon the land who follow the commandments of God, and who love the Lord and one another.  That the nations of the world might be like this nation and cast off evil things, even Satan, and begin to follow the counsel of the Lord.     I the Lord saw that the season was right, to bring back to the earth, the fullness of my counsel, even the fullness of my gospel and my church.  Many had softened their hearts and humbled themselves and began to seek help from their Father above. And my Spirit wrought upon their souls to bring about a mighty change, and to help them keep in remembrance, that it was I that spared them, and it is I the Lord that suffered them to come to this place.  Remember, I am the truth and the life, no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.  And they began to see for themselves truth and cast off the philosophies of men and to seek answers from the Lord.     Yea, in a season, I scattered my people upon the face of the earth that they might remember the Lord their God, and the few who were righteous were scattered unto salvation and the wicked unto captivity.  And in my own due time will I gather them in and bring forth and fulfill all my promises to my people of the house of Israel, to fulfill the covenant I made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that the seed of Abraham would be blessed and receive the blessings of my gospel and eternal life through the Gentiles, even the people of this nation,     These are the promises and covenants of the Lord made unto the children of Israel and unto Abraham.  All these whom hath spoken from the dust, yea, my prophets and apostles do so through my Spirit and speak from the dust of the earth through the words and holy scriptures and records which I caused them to write.  And the heavens above bear witness of me and of the Father and of these things to come and of all things that have come to pass for God’s children in all the earth and throughout all generations of man.     And my arm is stretched out still, to beckon to all, to come follow me, that I might gather all men unto me.  That they might obtain forgiveness of sin and freedom to their souls through my church and my gospel.  And in the early days of freedom and liberty in the land, I sent my Spirit unto a young boy of great faith, who lived among many who believed in me, and among many who wandered in disbelief.  And I brought him forth to be a prophet in the land, to act in my place, and to restore my church and the fulness of my gospel.       His name is Joseph Smith, and he is like unto Joseph in Egypt, and the prophets, Moses and Abraham.  And I did cause him to bring forth a record of an ancient people who dwelt upon this land, who were brought forth out of Jerusalem, by my same spirit, before the destruction and scattering of my people, and before I the Lord, God, came into the world. An ancient people who are ancestors of the native americans, a remnant of the house of Jacob.     And they were a people given the same promise of prosperity and freedom upon this land, if they would live and establish a righteous nation unto me, that I might prepare them, also, for the kingdom of God, and prosper them in all their doings and in all their days upon the earth.  And I called upon my chosen prophets to proclaim my gospel of repentance and baptism, and to bear record of me to all generations, and to keep a record of their proceedings.  And the records were gathered together for my people that they might learn to chose good over evil and to worship God their Father in Heaven, and to turn from the temptations of Satan forever.     Nevertheless, they did multiply upon the earth and kept a record, and after many generations became wicked and idolatrous and forgot their God in Heaven and all things which He did for them.  And they did destroy one another until there was but a remnant of them left upon this land.  And the last prophet who was good and faithful, I caused to wander and write all that had transpired, and to keep and preserve and join all the records into one.       And the name of the record is the Book of Mormon after the prophet Mormon, who lived in this promised land in ancient times.  And I caused Moroni, the the last of my prophets, and son of Mormon, to hide up the plates for a certain time of the Lord; to come before the children of men in latter-days; and to be joined with the records of mine ancient prophets, not of this fold.  And in all times and in all places have I caused records to be kept by my prophets, to witness to the world of my coming and my salvation, and to benefit the whole earth and all the inhabitants therein.  That they may learn the ways of the Lord, and keep the commandments and covenants of the Father; to one day come back into Our presence.     And in due time, I sent forth Moroni to show unto Joseph the records of my people upon this land.  And commanded my servant, Joseph, to translate the records and bring them forth unto the world, that my people might have the words of my chosen prophets in ancient times.  To show to the world the blessings they received by my hand for keeping the commandments, and the pains and wars and sufferings they experienced by their own hands, in times when they kept not my commandments.  And the record contains a history of a nation that was destroyed, and of a nation that dwelt here before them, which was utterly destroyed from off the face of this land, save their records only, because they would not keep my commandments, nor would they repent and turn unto me, nor turn from their abominations and works of darkness.     And all these things doth the Lord speak and put into my heart, mind, and soul as I ask for more understanding and to know and understand the truth of His ways and of his purposes. And I think on and reflect upon the the experience of Joseph Smith.  And he adds his voice, and I hear the voice of Joseph Smith speak to my heart personally, saying: I was just a young boy but I knew in my heart that I had a love for God and for all men, and I wanted to serve God with all of my heart.       I sought for truth and understanding and I found answers in the gospel of Christ, and I read from the words of James of the New Testament, first chapter, verse five, which reads, If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.  I understood it to mean that if I lacked wisdom I should ask of God directly and personally, and that He would teach me and answer my questions in the same way, directly, and personally.   I decided to follow the conviction in my heart, and determined to do as the scripture admonished, to ask God for wisdom and understanding.     And I was about to share more of what Joseph experienced as he became the prophet of the Lord, Jesus Christ and His church in these latter-days, but I am constrained by the Spirit to invite you to seek out the words and witness of Joseph Smith for yourself, to seek out a missionary from this church and hear the account in person, and judge for yourself, through the Lord Spirit, of the truthfulness of Joseph Smith’s calling from the Lord; if he truly is the mouthpiece of the lord, for our benefit and for these latter-days.     The spirit will guide you and tell you every needful thing and how one can give back to the Lord for all they have been given!  I thank God for my Savior Jesus Christ and for the prophet Joseph Smith!  Through him we have the fullness of the gospel and many more records of Jesus Christ and his teachings!  I can now study and learn the patterns, principles, and doctrines of service and salvation, and I will forever be grateful!     With all of my heart I wish to continue on and share with you all of the things that I have learned through the Spirit of the Lord, His servants, the scriptures, the founding fathers, and serving in His church, but you can see that I can get carried away and talk forever about these things!  I have learned for myself the true dream within all of us!  We are here to work and follow our original dream in heaven to become perfect like our Father in Heaven.  And I know this is all possible through Christ the Lord!     This is the reason for my desire to do more for the Lord and for creating this project and campaign.  I want to create for myself a business and organization that works for the Lord.  And it will allow me the opportunity to study His words further and to share them with all who desire to know the truth and realize true freedom in their hearts in this life and forever!  I want to build Zion, even a business worthy to be part of the Lord’s kingdom on earth!       And over the course of the last six months or so, the Lord has provided me with answers and a plan to realize these dreams and other desires of my heart: to lift up the poor and needy, to help people temporally as well, and to do my part and make contributions to the progress of the world somehow, even technologically using my background abilities!  So finally, now, I will try to paint a picture for you and explain as many of the details as I can regarding this inspiring plan or endeavor that I have received from the Lord!     For starters, I am working with a small group of friends, and since we have taken upon us the name of Christ as members, we desire to do likewise as an organization, to show our faith and devotion in serving the Lord, and the direction of our endeavor.  The name of our organization is, Charity the Pure Love of Christ. Charity the Pure Love of Christ      We would like to share with you the fundamental or foundational principles of our organization to show that they are the driving force within us to bring this endeavor about because these principles are the source of our products and services, and become the actual products and services that we provide.     First we desire to establish a righteous foundation; to continue to prove to God that it is a worthy endeavor, and that we are a faithful and trustworthy people to be authorized to use His name.  Second, to show to the world that we are a Christ centered business built up to the Lord, and we seek not our own, but to do the will of the Father!  We have adopted the same gospel principles in accordance with His church even The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and as members of the church we abide His laws and the laws of the land, even the laws of this great nation, the United States of America, first and foremost.     From thence, we feel instructed to pattern the organization and our practices and procedures after the foundation of the city or civilization of Enoch and the Golden Rule.  We live the Golden Rule of Christ, or as it is found in Mathew chapter 7 verse 12: Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets. Moreover, throughout all of the ages and generations of the earth, no civilization has been perfect in keeping the Golden Rule and all of God’s commandments and covenants except for the people of the city of Enoch!  What a pattern and example to follow!     Enoch was the son of Jared, and seventh Patriarch extending back to Adam.  He was born in a land of righteousness and promise like us!  He was called to proclaim repentance and baptism to the wicked that they might correct their ways or suffer destruction.  Many took offense to the word of the Lord, which he shared, and they opposed him and the Lord, and they called him wild.  However, some listened to him and followed his call to repentance and came unto the Lord.     Through many mighty miracles Enoch and his followers triumphed over their enemies.  They were obedient and united in heart and mind and carried out the laws of Christ.  And through their service there was no poor among them and they realized economic equality.  This led to even great spiritual unity and prosperity throughout their entire civilization.  The Lord poured out a multiplicity of blessings built them up as a City of Holiness, even Zion(or the kingdom of God, even Heaven on earth)!  They based their lives on the order and unity of Heavenly Father in the celestial kingdom, the highest glory.  And their civilization continued for 365 years and was received up into heaven to receive their eternal reward(save a small remnant which remained for a wise purpose in the Lord)!     We want to give our best effort in establishing a Zion organization and see if we can achieve economic equality among us as the very least of our goals.  It seems like a tall order but that is the exciting part, to raise the bar and challenge ourselves to see greater goodness come into the world and actually correct the corruption of the world, through the power of truth and righteousness!  We are a group of Christians trying to provide a service that assists with the caring of the spiritual welfare of people throughout the world; the same mission of Jesus Christ.     And in turn, one of the organization’s business proceedings is taking our beliefs, structure, or culture, if you will, and turning it into our product or services that we provide for other organizations and businesses throughout the world who may be looking for such things to improve their business for their people’s sake.  These services may be provided through counseling or consultation, for individuals, groups, or entire organizations and personnel; all inclusive.     As one example of a service we provide, it can begin as simple as instructing one how to pray or a company how to incorporating gospel principles in the business such as: teaching the golden rule, offering a prayer at the beginning of the day or in meetings, or quick spiritual thought or quote, which will help bring in the Spirit of the Lord, and bring in focus and unity.  And who knows, such a thought or quote, or even a hymn, may help someone throughout the day or week, in some way, or in some aspect of their lives.     In addition to the Golden Rule, we feel another foundational principle, that is a goal of ours to incorporate, is to follow the pattern of “laying up in store”. This is a principle that is not had among businesses of our day, but an example of it can be found in the Bible in the story of Joseph who was sold into Egypt.  Many are familiar with his story and how he was the beloved son of Jacob, who was called Israel, and he always did as his father instructed(another type or example of Christ).  His brother’s were jealous and sold Joseph as a slave to Potiphar of Egypt. Joseph loved God, however, and turned everything, no matter the difficulty, into something good, and I imagine he would be just as optimistic if he were alive today.  He was even thrown into prison for something he did not do.  He didn’t deserve any of it but took it in stride and kept the commandments of the Lord.       Then one day, he interprets the dream of Pharaoh, which no one else could do, through the power and gifts of God.  He tells Pharaoh the meanings of all the symbols in his dream and that they were the works of God which He would bring about soon upon the land.  There was to be seven years of plenty, to be followed by seven years of famine.  And the dream came with instructions of the Lord how to prepare in all things, which could only be interpreted by one with the Spirit and vision of the Lord.     And Pharaoh was pleased with the words of Joseph and understood them; to lay up in store the fifth part of the grain of the land in the seasons of plenty to carry them through the seasons of famine that they might not perish, and so the Lord would preserve the house of Jacob also, and His chosen people.     And we know that the Lord will come again but before the Lord comes there will be many changes great and terrible in the world including famines and pestilences and wars and rumors of wars, and we want to prepare for these things, moreover, we want to help you prepare yourself and your families and your friends; this is a part of the service we want to provide from our business to other businesses.  For in seasons of famine or disasters, those organizations that have not laid up in store for their people will find that there is no one in the land or in the office to work and move products or carry out the work and services of their business.     And from the same story we learn that money failed in Egypt and they gave of their cattle for food, and next, their lands for food and seeds, that they might plant and grow food for their families, and continue to live in the land.  Could the currency of our day fail?  Yes, very easily in fact, especially as things become more and more digital.  When the lights go out what have ye? Hopefully you have laid up in store provisions for difficult times for you and your people.  Or perhaps we can help you prepare today!     Another foundational principle is that of equal stewardship.  It is a principle our church thrives on and even the least of the many stewardships in every ward is no less serviceable than the other.  A good example of this is taught by the Savior himself, in the New Testament, in the parable of the servants of the vineyard. (Follow this link to see a video of the parable: https://www.lds.org/bible-videos/videos/laborer...)     It is not about the reward but the work and the agreement.  As we fulfill our work or stewardship, the Lord rewards us equally.  The focus in not of profit but of people, and sharing in the work of the Lord.  Consider the lilies of the field how they grow and toil not.  He is the great creator and redeemer and Savior of all.  We need but seek Him and His employ and He will provide for us temporally, and if we seek His words unto salvation He will put us to work in His vineyard and the work of the harvest, or saving souls, as we work as His disciples to feed His sheep spiritually and bring people to Christ.  And the Lord will always bless those who do His will, whether the blessings come in this life or in the next, they will always come, and are great indeed!     And again this is what we desire for ourselves and desire to share with others, especially, those businesses looking to provide even further, in addition to laying up in store for their people, and in dividing equally the stewardship, the beloved work of the business, among their people, that all might profit thereby equally, and be rich in spirit also.     One of the most difficult and challenging principles we have incorporated into the foundation of our business is that of consecration.  We must return to the first principle of the golden rule perfected by the people of Enoch for further understanding.     They lived the commandments with exactness and consecrated everything to the Lord and to each other!  This means that they recognized and understood that the Lord provided everything for them both temporally and spiritually and they sacrificed all back to God and for one another. Consecration is the highest order and to put it into perspective it simply means to share all that God has given equally with each other and in order!  It is so simple yet so profound and amazing!  And it can be done within a Christ centered business.  One that is truly established upon the gospel of Christ and in all its practices and through all of the members of the business who are also established in Christ and His doctrine, wholeheartedly, and understand their stewardship.     The great beauty of consecration is that the focus is united and hearts are stitched together for the sake of Zion and God’s Kingdom!  It strengthens the faith of all, and lifts up the poor and the needy, and humbles the rich or proud; and all things become common among the people. Moreover each person will give and receive equally, meaning that each has ownership of the business of Zion and all share the stewardships and responsibilities.     And likewise it is our greatest desire to share this principle, law, and challenge with other businesses and organizations to help them achieve the greatest blessings a Christ centered business can achieve even that of shared ownership and celestial consecration and glory!     And last but not the least, we are to serve and volunteer throughout the world and this has taken from in our company as foundational branches we are calling Charity, Freedom, and Volunteer Centers!  We want to establish these centers in places where people gather to shop, dine, or find entertainment; places of high traffic so we can be among our brothers and sisters and be and outlet for help if needed! Charity, Freedom, & Volunteer Center      This is the most exciting part, and is the main part of the organization and of giving back!  It is an actual facility or center that will help us interact, as the Savior did during His ministry, one on one and face to face in our towns, cities, and communities, with anyone and everyone who is looking for assistance!  We are disciples of Christ after all, and it is our calling as members of His church to be missionaries everyone, and to share the gospel with our fellow man and brothers and sisters in the world.  We cannot move forward in our hopes of eternal progression and applying Christlike attributes to our souls without service! The missions of the church include: Preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ, Perfecting the Saints, Redeeming the Dead, and Caring for the Poor and Needy, and we can establish these centers as an additional source in carrying out the missions of the Lord!     We want to do this everyday with the main focus being spiritual freedom and spiritual guidance for all!  We want to create small establishments that provide these things for free and help those who see and feel the captivity of the adversary find deliverance and spiritual liberty,  through the principles, parables, teachings, and truths of the gospel, through the words and works of Christ!      By small and simple things are great things brought to pass!  The Centers focus on these small and simple things, even prayer and scripture study.  These two things are some of the most effective tools we can offer and that we can use to bring the Spirit into our lives and the lives of others, and it is by the Spirit that mighty changes can come about in our lives!  And they must be done daily that the changes may be everlasting!     Our spirits are the most sensitive things in the world, and they need to communicate with the Spirit of our Lord in order to maintain their spiritual strength and integrity.  Prayer provides the way to communication to our Heavenly Father the desires of our hearts.  And we can tell him anything and ask for things we need.   He knows us and loves us, and I know and promise that He hears and answers every sincere prayer according to His will and timing.     And often times the Lord will answer our prayers through the scriptures and the words and experiences of prophets of old.  And the scriptures become His way of communicating to us his answers and instructions that we might find what we need.  And sometimes He answers prayers through others or small daily miracles.  And so these and many other principles are the curriculum, service, and charity that our business and these Centers provide, and to feast upon the word of the Lord all the day long each and every day!     Another initiative of the Centers and the foundation, Charity the Pure Love of Christ, is to establish a place of spiritual education.  A place where we can share with people who are looking for help in overcoming anything that may be hindering their freedom or to help move individuals from “I have a dream” for freedom to “I have a plan” for freedom.  And this is where your contributions come in, as we meet one on one with individuals or with families or groups who have spiritual dilemmas, we can provide them with examples of similar battles and struggles from your stories couple with the true stories of prophets and people in the scriptures.     We know the Lord is able to help with any circumstance or situation because He knows that everyone faces adversity and that the adversary and his followers work hard to customize their traps for each of God’s children to make us slaves to our habits and appetites or to entice us with the riches of the earth or to steal, harm, enslave, or even destroy another’s life.  How does He know all the answers?  Because He performed the atonement in which He took upon himself the sins of all the world and suffered the pain and bitter anguish and full punishment of the law for all of us, for all of our misdeeds and wrongdoings.  And so Christ knows us better than we know ourselves, and has all of the answers and we want to present Him and His saving teachings to you to help you find freedom!     These centers not only provide the spiritual nourishment and sustenance for each patron that comes in, but it also provides a much needed service opportunity for the brothers and sisters who work, serve, and volunteer there!  It is a center for edification of both or all individuals or groups involved including families and friends.  It can be a safe house from the storm.  If you are struggling with something you just can’t find answers to come to the charity center for help! Perhaps you feel downtrodden, depressed, or discouraged by all of the noise, negativity, and bullying in the world, and you would like to shake it off somehow.  We want to say, ""Come to the center, we are just down town or around the corner!  Or give us a call we want to listen, and we know His words will help!  For we are the humble recipients of Christ’s words and atonement, and we know He can help because He helps us each and every day!”     Or perhaps you feel like doing a kind act or service that day.  Again, we say, “Come by and volunteer, and visit, and share with others the reason for your happiness and the reasons for your willingness to follow Him!”     It’s not just about establishing spiritual safe havens in one place.  We want to build these centers up unto the Lord in all the world for all of God’s children and for Christ!  To help all in the world find freedom for their souls and their lands and connect the global family together.  To educate all about Christ and Heavenly Father and that we are all God’s children and one eternal family!     If ever there is a spiritual crisis in you life or one you see in your family or friends lives we want to be your spiritual response team.  If we are not close, look to a nearby member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints(or LDS for short), or for a Mormon neighbor(our nickname) for anything you stand in need of, especially spiritual assistance, for that is our entire way of life! We go to church and live the gospel and prepare ourselves everyday to be ready to help!  We are your Christian brothers and sisters and we uphold the laws of the land and fight for the title of liberty and truth throughout the world, and we stand together forever against evil and Satan.     If you seek us out and we aren’t able to help or be the good Samaritan you need then look for another and give us a second and perhaps even a third chance to prove our worth!  The Lord has prepared someone near you that will help, I promise!  Sometimes we get distracted by the world just like you, but we practice applying the atonement of Jesus Christ daily in our lives and He will not fail us and allow us to fail you.     So come to us or let us come to you for anything, and we will work together with you and with the help of the Lord we will discover His answers and His solutions to any problem, question, or concern.  After all we are His Children and He loves us all.  God’s greatest desire is to helps us, and He does all He can to bring us back into His presence to one day give us rest from the cares of the world, and He hopes with all of His heart that we will hearken to the words of His beloved Son Jesus Christ, so He can provide us with every needful thing daily as we rely upon His Son.      Service or volunteering is the healing spiritual power for the soul.  It is the next driving force of Americans and for all once and individual finds freedom to their souls.  It is the foundation of our church and missionary program and everyone is a volunteer in the church and it is how the work of the Lord moves forward.  Once we realize the dream of freedom it behooves us to get to work in obtaining it for ourselves or for others.  This is the same when one receives spiritual freedom, we are called by the Spirit to proclaim the everlasting power of forgiveness and where to find it!     Remember the words of our former president John F. Kennedy who said, “And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you — ask what you can do for your country. My fellow citizens of the world: ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man.  Finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world, ask of us the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you. With a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that here on earth God's work must truly be our own.”     Let us ask ourselves this question, ""What can I do for my country?"", moreover, we must ask ourselves, “What can I do for God?”.  If you ask with a sincere heart the answers will come to your heart and mind and the Lord will the answer, and He will say, “Feed my sheep.”  And we must do as we are instructed be it temporal or spiritual, and answer the call to serve wherever the Lord needs us.  Let us pledge our allegiance by stepping forward as volunteers and serving the poor and the needy, or strengthening the poor in spirit.     I would love to continue to share all the possibilities of these centers, but the goal is to help even one person if we can!  To leave the ninety and nine and go after the one!  We want to know if you are interested in helping out or what you are already doing as volunteers and freedom fighters! All of these stories are stories of success and we want to hear them and compile them and use them to help others!  We want others who want to join us and share in this work to let us know!      And last but not least, is a principle of ""Return and Report"".  It is accountability!  We must all prove our worth here in this life by our good works before God on judgement day!  We want you to keep tabs on us as we strive for perfect honest and transparency in all our dealings with our fellow man.  We will report everything so we can make sure we practice what we preach before God and the world!     And all these things I share with you with the hope that they may bring about goodness to someone in the world.  I hope I can help the Lord in his work.  I know I will keep trying to serve the Lord all my days, to give back to Him, even just a little if I can.  I hope you will see truth in all these things, and I hope you will come unto Christ and receive freedom from sin and true happiness to your hearts as I have through Christ the Lord!  May God bless you all with freedom and happiness forever! Thank you for considering this project and campaign!      As a last reminder,  we know this is a great endeavor and huge responsibility and we know the Lord will make us equal to the task, we just need your help to begin the task and make this a truly worthy endeavor, of the people, for the people!  We know we cannot appeal to all but if something caught hold of your heart somewhere throughout, we hope that you are ready and willing to donate or contribute to the cause!     We have nothing to give in return but our deepest gratitude, much like the hungry beggar on the street corner.  Consider for a moment, when you give to them, do you expect something in return?  Don’t we hope with all of our hearts that those we give to will use the money for something good, something that will help and last!?  This is true charity!  And this is our humble appeal to all of you!  We promise we will do great things with your donations just as we have done so with all that the Lord has given us already!  And He stands ready to reward you for your kindness, and is preparing blessings for you now and blessings in store for you in Heaven!     Please also will you consider contributing to the project with your stories of freedom through Christ, that we have been asking for in this project!?  Your voices are the voices we want to hear forever!  For they build us up!  And we know they will help build up the poor and lowly in spirit! Even anonymous stories will help someone, perhaps even eternally!     Anything you can do will help or if you think of something I have not please message me! neighborabe@gmail.  And we hope to be able and will try to thank you in person some day! Thank you all so much!See the Updates tab for further light and truth and our progress!  We will be working on this campaign and this endeavor every day!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>MakrSpace Lethbridge is a company dedicated to fostering a community that support and encourages creativity, ingenuity, and authenticity. Lethbridge is a growing city with a lack of resources for young people to create and engage their creative spirit. MakrSpace Lethbridge was founded by a 17-year-old Lethbridge College student who believes everyone should have access to a space that fosters innovation and works with the community.</p>
<p><font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Establishing a Makerspace in Lethbridge will allow students and adults to collaborate and create </span>meaningful<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span>projects that will inspire and empower others. A Makerspace provides a unique environment that many cannot find at home, in school, or at their workplace. The environment fosters innovation and creation which is what we are all about.</font></p>
<p>Many students and adults have lost the opportunity to be creative and even more do not have the ability to access equipment and technology that allows them to be creative and innovative. We want to provide an inclusive space that allows people to think outside the box and create something great and meaningful.</p>
<p>While we are a for profit company, we operate on the basis that our community is paramount and we will work with them to benefit the community. We will be dedicating a majority of our profit to community sponsorships and grants to certain innovators/creators that utilize our space. We also believe operating as a ""for profit"" company allows us to provide higher quality equipment to our users and allows us to provide additional perks to our users.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">What is a Makerspace?</span></h3>
<p>A Makerspace is, in essence, a space that allows creators to connect and collaborate on projects by sharing ideas, equipment, and knowledge. Anyone can access the facility and anyone can use the equipment. While the area is public you do require a membership to use certain equipment and technology. Memberships will be available in certain lengths such as daily, monthly, and yearly. We will also have spaces for users to host meetings, work on large scale projects in groups, and work alone. Our facility will also have office space available for users to rent on a monthly/yearly basis depending on their needs. We will also be developing partnerships with various organizations to bring our users exclusive services to jumpstart their idea.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">What We Need</span></h3>
<p>A makerspace requires a rather large upfront investment to get the tools, equipment, and location needed to properly serve the users. We will be using the funds raised through this campaign to purchase essential equipment and begin the process of renovating a space to contain our Makerspace. All funds raised after our goal will also be put towards the purchase of additional equipment and marketing to ensure we can serve Lethbridge to our best ability.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>One of the risks we face when trying to open a Makerspace is that a majority of people have no idea what they are! We want to change that through public awareness and getting the public involved through little workshops and community events. We believe this is a challenge that cane turned into a great opportunity.</p>
<p>Another risk when opening a Makerspace in Lethbridge is that we have no real way to gauge interest as no one has ever really tried to open a Makerspace before. TechBridge Makerspace tried to establish itself in 2016-2018; however, they were unsuccessful due to their lack of media attention, public awareness, and overall engagement with the community. We believe we can succeed if we engage the community and get our name/idea out to the public, specifically students.</p>

</div></div>","Summary
MakrSpace Lethbridge is a company dedicated to fostering a community that support and encourages creativity, ingenuity, and authenticity. Lethbridge is a growing city with a lack of resources for young people to create and engage their creative spirit. MakrSpace Lethbridge was founded by a 17-year-old Lethbridge College student who believes everyone should have access to a space that fosters innovation and works with the community.
Establishing a Makerspace in Lethbridge will allow students and adults to collaborate and create meaningful projects that will inspire and empower others. A Makerspace provides a unique environment that many cannot find at home, in school, or at their workplace. The environment fosters innovation and creation which is what we are all about.
Many students and adults have lost the opportunity to be creative and even more do not have the ability to access equipment and technology that allows them to be creative and innovative. We want to provide an inclusive space that allows people to think outside the box and create something great and meaningful.
While we are a for profit company, we operate on the basis that our community is paramount and we will work with them to benefit the community. We will be dedicating a majority of our profit to community sponsorships and grants to certain innovators/creators that utilize our space. We also believe operating as a ""for profit"" company allows us to provide higher quality equipment to our users and allows us to provide additional perks to our users.

What is a Makerspace?
A Makerspace is, in essence, a space that allows creators to connect and collaborate on projects by sharing ideas, equipment, and knowledge. Anyone can access the facility and anyone can use the equipment. While the area is public you do require a membership to use certain equipment and technology. Memberships will be available in certain lengths such as daily, monthly, and yearly. We will also have spaces for users to host meetings, work on large scale projects in groups, and work alone. Our facility will also have office space available for users to rent on a monthly/yearly basis depending on their needs. We will also be developing partnerships with various organizations to bring our users exclusive services to jumpstart their idea.

What We Need
A makerspace requires a rather large upfront investment to get the tools, equipment, and location needed to properly serve the users. We will be using the funds raised through this campaign to purchase essential equipment and begin the process of renovating a space to contain our Makerspace. All funds raised after our goal will also be put towards the purchase of additional equipment and marketing to ensure we can serve Lethbridge to our best ability.

Risks & Challenges
One of the risks we face when trying to open a Makerspace is that a majority of people have no idea what they are! We want to change that through public awareness and getting the public involved through little workshops and community events. We believe this is a challenge that cane turned into a great opportunity.
Another risk when opening a Makerspace in Lethbridge is that we have no real way to gauge interest as no one has ever really tried to open a Makerspace before. TechBridge Makerspace tried to establish itself in 2016-2018; however, they were unsuccessful due to their lack of media attention, public awareness, and overall engagement with the community. We believe we can succeed if we engage the community and get our name/idea out to the public, specifically students.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are Rød Mos, a fresh Rotterdam startup, introducing people to different mushroom varieties grown by us in an urban setting using recycled materials. Mushrooms are natural decomposers and can grow from things such as food waste and paper waste; our idea is to rent unused industrial or commercial buildings on the outskirts of the city, which is relatively cheap, and to grow different types of mushrooms using waste from restaurants and shops. This way we can provide a wide and tasty selection of vegan, biological food that is locally produced, and at the same time reduce the carbon footprint of both the city and its residents.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What we need is enough funds to be able to rent a building and buy the equipment needed to start large-scale mushroom production. With our goal of €70,000, we would be able to operate for a minimum of a year, which is long enough to establish the solid supply chain required for the circular business model we propose, where we get waste from shops and restaurants and use it to grow more mushrooms, which are then sold back to them. The main expenses in setting up Rød Mos consist of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rent. This is one of the major costs, as even unused industrial buildings have a price. Rent combined with the materials and labor needed to set up our growing rooms would account for almost half of the startup cost.</li>
<li>Equipment. Electrics, electronics, and other things such as transportation are needed to be able to operate the business cost-effectively. These constitute around a quarter of the goal.</li>
<li>Running costs. There are many things that must be paid during operations, and that is what the last quarter is reserved for.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Of course you do not get nothing for helping us out! We have a perk tier created with goodies related to us. Our goal is both to have a sustainable business, but also to help the local community and environment. Even if you do not fund, this project brings the local community:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new, innovative way of growing food</li>
<li>A way to reduce waste and the associated costs</li>
<li>New job opportunities</li>
<li>A wider selection of protein-rich, vegan and biological food</li>
<li>A use for old industrial and commercial buildings</li>
</ul>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risks and challenges are based mostly in the funding phase, as our team does have some experience growing mushrooms and doing practical work. However, there still are some risks:</p>
<ul>
<li>It may be difficult to convince businesses to establish a supply chain with us to begin with, it being a new concept. Until more solid customers can be found to get the waste from and to sell to, production would need to use at least in some part non-recycled materials to begin with, and selling not to businesses but small local shops. This is not exactly meeting our green goals or particularly profitable, but is a necessary middle-step given the circumstances</li>
<li>Mushroom harvests can fail due to factors such as contamination, so it is important to not put all our eggs in the same basket and sell many different mushroom varieties, as well as to have multiple and separated growing areas.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Not everyone has money to donate, but if you like our concept there is still something you can do!</p>
<ul>
<li>Share our campaign with your friends to let them know what we are trying to do</li>
<li>Talk about mushrooms! Have a look at your local grocery store's mushroom selection, and then look online at all the different types there are to eat.  Get more people on that mushroom train!</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! Hey! Hello! My name is Kelsey and I'm mom to two dogs and a cat. My oldest dog, Jameson, has been with me for 9 years now and I am STILL obsessed with him. All I want to do is spend time with him and pamper him. I know I'm not alone in this.</p>
<p>However, when I was shopping for our latest addition, Gracie, I found that it was nearly impossible to get quality, unique dog supplies from a local business. When I go to a new city, one of the first things I search for is a pet boutique. Cities of similar sizes and demographics can support multiple local pet boutiques and we don't even have one! And then I realized, if I want one so badly, if I would be so excited, if I would spend ALL of my money there, why can't I make it happen?</p>
<p>So it's happening. I'm hoping to open a brick and mortar local pet boutique where the fine pet parents of Champaign-Urbana can find small batch, eco friendly, quality made pet products right here in their hometown. Of course there are a few other big ideas I have in mind for when the time comes. :) </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Okay, so here is where you come in. I need money, obviously, but I also want to only sell products that I have personally tested and trust to use on my own pets. So I'm asking for money... and I will certainly graciously accept your money, but I also came up with a great way to jump right in to selling products as well as get a few extra fluffy test subjects. </p>
<p>For a $50-$99 donation, you will get a box of dog or cat supplies worth $50 as well a $10 voucher for use in the future. </p>
<p>For a $100+  donation, you will get a box of dog (sorry cats) supplies worth $100 and a voucher for $25. </p>
<p>All I ask of you is that you tell me if you have strong feelings about any of the products to help me get a feel of what people would like to see more or less of! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Game Plan</h3>
<p>It would be really cool to just pay rent on a storefront and have a grand opening right away. However, I do plan on starting off being eCommerce based. The money raised during this campaign will go to building an inventory and cost associated with getting things up and running. When the online stores reach a level capable of supporting it, it will be time to move onto a brick and mortar location. I'm trying to really straddle the line between being prepared for anything while planning for everything and just jumping right in. </p>

<p><strong>Q: How did you come up with the name <i>Cultivate</i>?</strong></p>
<p>A: We discovered the word <strong><i>cultivate</i></strong> while researching synonyms for 'community' and 'nurturing' and were immediately drawn to it. The significance of <i><strong>Cultivate</strong> </i>quickly increased two-fold for us:</p>
<p> 1. It means <i>to develop land for growing -</i> which reminds us of international coffee farmers and their hard labor.</p>
<p>2. It also means <i>to enrich and nurture or take care of</i>. We've personally dedicated our lives to that very meaning. Growing and nurturing relationships is what's most important to us.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Where will you be located?</strong></p>
<p>A: We have a potential location on Saginaw Road on the edge of Flint &amp; Grand Blanc, Michigan.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What will your hours be?</strong></p>
<p>A: We plan to be open Monday-Thursday: 10am-7pm; Friday: 10am-9pm; Saturday: 9am-2pm; Closed on Sundays. </p>
<p><strong>Q: Will you be roasting your own coffee?</strong></p>
<p>A: Not at this time. It's important to us to partner with and support already established Michigan coffee roasters. We may do our own roasting in the future!</p>
<p><strong>Q: What if I don't drink coffee?</strong></p>
<p>A: We plan to also serve loose leaf teas &amp; and homemade Chai recipes!</p>
<p><strong>Q: What food will you be serving?</strong> </p>
<p>A: We plan to serve desserts, pastries, and an awesome specialty item (which you'll have to wait and see!) <strong>We will also have gluten free &amp; vegan goodies as well! </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: How can I help?</strong></p>
<p>A: Donate and spread the word of <strong>#CultivateCoffeeCompany</strong> through social media like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, email, and actual conversations.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I donate offline?</strong></p>
<p>A: Absolutely! Just contact us at hello@cultivateflint.com and we'll set it up. </p>
<p><strong>Q: What happens if we don't raise all the money?</strong></p>
<p>A: We will try our best to launch with limited funding. With your help, Cultivate Coffee Co will be a huge success! </p>
<p><strong>Q: Do you have a website?</strong></p>

<p>A: Each perk has an estimated delivery month/year listed in the description. You will be notified of any delays.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will any perks go out before the campaign is completed?</strong></p>
<p>A: Unfortunately, no.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do I tell you what t-shirt size I need?</strong></p>
<p>A: There is an option to choose your size inside the perk. </p>
<p><strong>Q: What if I want more than one perk?</strong></p>
<p>A: You can make multiple gifts on Indiegogo using a single account. Just make sure you use the same email address and login, so we’ll know that all of your perks are meant to go to the same person.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How much is shipping? </strong></p>
<p>A: Shipping is included in the perk price, regardless of your location. We will not be shipping internationally. </p>

Help us spread the word:
1. Share #CultivateCoffeeCompany on social media! Use the Indiegogo share tools at the top of the campaign page, on the right.
2. Talk about the project with your friends!

Q: How did you come up with the name Cultivate?
A: We discovered the word cultivate while researching synonyms for 'community' and 'nurturing' and were immediately drawn to it. The significance of Cultivate quickly increased two-fold for us:
 1. It means to develop land for growing - which reminds us of international coffee farmers and their hard labor.
2. It also means to enrich and nurture or take care of. We've personally dedicated our lives to that very meaning. Growing and nurturing relationships is what's most important to us.
Q: Where will you be located?
A: We have a potential location on Saginaw Road on the edge of Flint & Grand Blanc, Michigan.
Q: What will your hours be?
A: We plan to be open Monday-Thursday: 10am-7pm; Friday: 10am-9pm; Saturday: 9am-2pm; Closed on Sundays. 
Q: Will you be roasting your own coffee?
A: Not at this time. It's important to us to partner with and support already established Michigan coffee roasters. We may do our own roasting in the future!
Q: What if I don't drink coffee?
A: We plan to also serve loose leaf teas & and homemade Chai recipes!
Q: What food will you be serving? 
A: We plan to serve desserts, pastries, and an awesome specialty item (which you'll have to wait and see!) We will also have gluten free & vegan goodies as well! 
Q: How can I help?
A: Donate and spread the word of #CultivateCoffeeCompany through social media like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, email, and actual conversations.
Q: Can I donate offline?
A: Absolutely! Just contact us at hello@cultivateflint.com and we'll set it up. 
Q: What happens if we don't raise all the money?
A: We will try our best to launch with limited funding. With your help, Cultivate Coffee Co will be a huge success! 
Q: Do you have a website?
A: Yes, we do! It's www.cultivateflint.com. You can also find us on Facebook & Instagram.
Email: hello@cultivateflint.com 

Q: When will I get my perks?
A: Each perk has an estimated delivery month/year listed in the description. You will be notified of any delays.
Q: Will any perks go out before the campaign is completed?
A: Unfortunately, no.

A: There is an option to choose your size inside the perk. 
Q: What if I want more than one perk?
A: You can make multiple gifts on Indiegogo using a single account. Just make sure you use the same email address and login, so we’ll know that all of your perks are meant to go to the same person.
Q: How much is shipping? 
A: Shipping is included in the perk price, regardless of your location. We will not be shipping internationally. 
Q: What if I want one of the perks and it is sold out?
A: Some perks are only available in limited quantities because of their special nature. So get these perks while they’re hot and contribute now! If possible, we will increase the number of a few limited release perks.",14.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>WHO WE ARE</p>
<p>Hi, my name is April Yutzy-Kuhl. The idea of a provincial Maker directory came to mind in the spring of 2019 when I was in search of a specific product that I had previously purchased from a local Maker and wanted to purchase again. After a long and unsuccessful search, I realized this important service was needed! </p>
<p>I have been working with Lowell Klassen of Profuzion Studio for roughly 7 months, to develop our brand and website details. We believe that Manitoba Artisans &amp; Makers deserve to have their own directory! And not a basic, simple listing, but an elaborate and extensive directory to showcase just how unique they and their products are! Let's bring awareness to these talented individuals who work hard at their creations!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>OUR VISION</p>
<p>To put all Manitoba makers on the map, through a well-known, affordable, and unique marketing platform.</p>

<h3>My name is Jessica and I'm a photographer.</h3>
<p>I have been photographing families for over ten years as a way to have a flexible, portable income while my husband served in the military.  He finished his commitment in 2014 and we moved to southern Indiana to find our forever home. He soon qualified as 80% disabled and we struggled for a couple of years to find work that would support our family and his health. I soon realized that I would no longer be able to stay at home and teach our children, so I found a local school that I loved and decided to open my Photography studio full-time.  When I moved into the space in April of this year, I quickly realized that it would hold much more than just a few props and backgrounds.  After hours of brainstorming I came up with this idea to combine several of my passions into one.</p>
<ul>
<li>photography</li>
<li>crafting</li>
<li>RRR (reduce, reuse, recycle)</li>
<li>and supporting other small businesses</li>
</ul>
<p>My store currently houses 10 handmade, local vendors. In addition, it currently also houses the gently used kid's items of at least 6 families for resale. When a person shops in my store they have the ability to contribute to the livelihood of at least 17 families, while shopping for unique clothing and gift items! I love the concept, and I'm working hard to continue to grow it, while needing to stay as debt free as possible for the financial health of our growing family.</p>
<p>Right around the time that I signed my lease, I found out I was pregnant.  Little did I know, that my business plan would now have to include a newborn in the middle of my brand new lease agreement. Surprise! I've stressed for months of how I was going to make it through the month or so around his birth, without letting everyone down. I think this campaign has the potential to see my dream to fruition, with the help of friends, family, and community.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So here is the break down:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1,000 for one months rent and utilities</li>
<li>$1,000 to pay an employee to keep the doors open for one month</li>
<li>$500 to pay for wholesale items from my vendors to continue to support them even while I am unable to continue marketing for them during this time.</li>
</ul>
<p>The good news is that you don't even have to give something for nothing! Based on the amount you give, you can receive</p>
<ul>
<li>chances to win a photo session</li>
<li>a kid's t-shirt custom designed by my daughter</li>
<li>store credit</li>
<li>leather hair accessories</li>
<li>fall foliage photo session and more!</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure to check out the perks!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our store is the only one like it in our area. There are only two other stores that sell children's clothing within about a 30 minute drive, and guess what? If you spend $20 there they don't notice. When you shop from a small business owner, you directly impact those families. When you shop from MY small business you currently have the opportunity to directly impact 17 families. Help me to continue help my community.</p>
<p><strong>IF I DO NOT MEET MY GOAL</strong>, funds will first be used towards rent and utilities. Under these circumstances I will do my best to hire both an employee (at reduced hours) and make purchases from my vendors.</p>
<p><strong>IF WE RAISE MORE THAN MY GOAL</strong>, 25% of any ""extra"" will be donated to three local charities that are close to my heart.  If you would like more information on these charities please contact me.</p>

<p><strong>Alright guys, here is my problem</strong>.... Did you know that Polk County is the #1 county in the state of Florida for animal euthanizations? And sadly, up to 70% of pets euthanized are because of space limitations. When the pandemic hit, pet adoptions increased, thousands of pets were finally getting the home they deserved. Now with people returning to work, shelters are again at maximum capacity and are struggling to make space for these loving animals. </p>

We Are LOCAL MAKERS-- we dare to dream and have the desire to create.

We are COMMUNITY-- neighbors, friends, and family.

When you BUY LOCAL-- you help weave the cultural threads of our neighborhoods together, support livelihoods, and fuel passions.
Pop-Local is a retail home for products created from local makers, a one-stop-shop existing to support and share the stories of independent businesses, artists and artisans local to Vancouver/Portland Metro & its surrounding area!WE SUPPORT THOSE WHO DARE TO DREAM AND HAVE THE PASSION TO CREATE. Our mission as a company is to fuel independent businesses, connect the community, and inspire a greater local economy. OUR STORYWe began our journey as a Pop-Up Store! Pictured is 'NMV Pop-Local 'In light of the unprecedented events of 2020, the concept for Pop-Local was born from a mission to help support local independent businesses, makers, and artists throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Our current pop-up shop represents over 65 local brands and is now on the path to becoming it’s own brick-and-mortar location. As a result, the current pop-up shop location will be closing at the end of May in preparation for the move.In order to turn this dream into a reality—and the current pop-up into a long-term Vancouver establishment—we need your help!  Although we set a launch goal at $5,000, our hope is to raise funds towards our entire buildout cost estimated to be $50,0000. All of your contributions and donations will go towards our store design, build-out costs, wall finishes, built-in shelving for merchandise, refrigeration units, and retail fixtures. We have some amazing Indiegogo Backer Perks lined up for your donations, featuring handmade products that are designed by some of our very own local vendors.  There are also options for unique memorabilia and personalized name plates that will commemorate your contribution in playing a founding role in Pop-Local’s roots.Thank you for taking the time to join our cause! HOW IT ALL STARTED Night Market Vancouver—another company belonging to founder Jessica Chan—was a family-friendly, monthly marketplace that occurred year-round at Terminal 1 of the Vancouver Waterfront.  Each monthly event showcased over 80 local vendors and featured live music, rotating entertainment, and food and drink for purchase.  Night Market Vancouver brought thousands of members from the community together in a fun environment to celebrate the local culture and to support small, independent businesses.In March 2020, however, Night Market Vancouver (like so many other companies) was forced to shut down and halt all activity until further notice due to health and safety concerns in light of the novel COVID-19 virus.  As an event business that relied entirely on large public gatherings to generate revenue, Night Market Vancouver was entirely without income.  Chan was forced to pivot her business model in order to survive.  Although she has plans to bring back the Night Market Vancouver event when it is safe to do so, her primary focus shifted to building a store to continue to support local makers, crafters, and artisans throughout the on-going pandemic.  The concept for Pop-Local was created to serve as a new home for local vendors — to showcase their brands and to bring their products to market without the monthly event setup, in a safer space, and without the need for vendors to put up booths.The Pop-Local store officially started its journey in September 2020, as a pop-up shop in the heart of historic downtown Vancouver, Washington at 111 W 9th St. as “NMV Pop Local”.  Chan was offered a temporary space by a good friend (a big thank you Most Everything Vintage) and jumped at the opportunity, driven by a desire to help some of the local businesses and people affected by the shutdown.  Thanks to the local community’s incredible reception to the pop-up store, Pop-Local has decided to go brick-and-mortar in a more permanent fashion! NMV Pop-LocalFrom Chan's backyard to reality!

What kind of setup does it require?</b></p><p>Solar Liberator does not require any setup at all. It is fully integrated and functional straight away out of the packaging. You can simply place it where sunlight falls and it will start generating power. Connecting the 500W Solar Liberator to your home is as simple as plugging it into a wall socket.</p><p><b>2. Does it work in gloomy weather?</b></p><p>On overcast days where there is reasonable cloud cover, the power capacity can drop but with the battery backup it could sustain a consistent supply. </p><p><b>3. What happens on rainy days?</b></p><p>On rainy days the solar irradiance is much lower than on a sunny day, and hence the amount of energy generated by your Solar Liberator will be much less than normal. Nevertheless, depending on the capacity and charge level of the batteries of your Solar Liberator, you can continue drawing power from it as normal.</p><p><b>4. Can I use it at night?</b></p><p>The battery pack that comes with the unit will be sufficient to keep it functional for up to 2 hours at full capacity. If the power being drawn from the unit is less, it will last longer. </p><p>It is also possible to add more battery units to enhance the use of the unit at night, in gloomy weather, etc.</p><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">5. Why is Solar Liberator different from other solar power solutions?</b><br/></p><p>Most of the solar power generation units out there are commercial solutions for which you need to hire a contractor who will assemble the system at your premises and wire it into your house! These systems will cost you anywhere from $15,000 to $50,000 upfront. These solutions are sometimes a good choice if you think you will need over 10KW of power.Solar Liberator is designed to be the right choice if your needs are below 10KW (which is the vast majority of households) or if you want to slowly transition to solar energy one step at a time without committing to a large system upfront. </p><p>Further, Solar Liberator’s portable, flexible and extensible design and fully integrated packaging makes it the most sensible choice if you want to add solar power to non traditional living spaces and vehicles such as boats, caravans, mobile homes, sheds, etc..</p><p>On the other end you have small DC only low power solar panels that sometimes succeed in charging your phone etc.. but generally these are nothing more than toys or junk that gets thrown away or forgotten after sometime.</p><p><b>6. <b>What about warranty of the components?</b></b></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The high grade poly-crystalline PV cells come with 25 year warranty from the original manufacturers. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Each Solar Liberator unit will carry a 5-year materials and workmanship warranty which includes the electronics. The minimum design lifespan for the electronics is 10 years, but should last much longer. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The included Li-ion batteries are designed to last 5 years by the use of advanced software optimized charging cycles and thermal dissipation control. They are warranted for a minimum of one year.</span></p><p><b>7. How can I claim Federal and state benefits for renewable energy when I get a Solar Liberator?</b></p><p>With the 500W Solar Liberator, you should be entitled to claim the 30% federal tax credit and also may be eligible to claim various other state and federal benefits for renewable energy. Prior to delivery, we will convert your Indiegogo contribution into a purchase and provide you with the necessary invoices and documents that will enable you to claim these benefits.</p><p></p><p>

Do Solar Liberator
units work with European and other international electrical systems as well as
the US?</b></p>
<p>Absolutely. The portable units (25W and 100W) have a voltage
selector switch to select the output voltage/frequency. The socket panel in
these units will come with appropriate A/C sockets according to your delivery address.
For example the units shipped to the US will contain Type B (NEMA 5-15) A/C
sockets, whereas units shipped to the UK will contain Type G (BS 1363) sockets.
</p>
<p>Similarly, the 500W unit will be supplied with a plug that
is compatible with your local standards. The grid-tie capability in the 500W
unit detects the voltage/frequency of the grid supply it is connected to, and outputs
power to your home’s electrical network with the exact same voltage/frequency/phase
(from 100V -250V and 50/60 Hz).</p>
<p><b>2. What precautions
are taken to prevent the 500W unit from reverse feeding power output when the
grid supply is down?</b></p>
<p>In grid-tie mode, Solar Liberator will shut down power output
if the grid supply goes down, to prevent reverse feeding. This is a requirement
for the UL 1741/IEEE 1547 certification which is the standard required by most
utility companies for equipment that feeds power into their grids.</p>
<p><b>3. Can the 500 watt
units be used off-grid? </b></p>
<p>There are two separate outlets for grid-tie and ‘Always On’ off-grid
output. This is for safety and to prevent accidentally connecting the wrong
output to the grid. The grid-tie output can simply be plugged into a wall
socket using the provided cable, whereas you need to draw cabling and connect
up the off-grid output terminals via a transfer switch that disconnects the
grid when operational. </p>
<p><b>4. How does the unit know
to output power when connected to a transfer switch that has triggered due to
utility grid failure? Wouldn’t the unit still believe it was in island protect
mode?</b></p>
<p>The grid tie output will shut down when the utility supply goes
down. If you have wired the ‘Always On’ off-grid out put through a transfer
switch, when the transfer switch triggers, then your house will be supplied
power from the ‘Always On’ output, and is isolated from the grid. </p>
<p><b>5. I saw that 4 is
the maximum number of 500W panels that can be chained. Does this mean you can
also have more than 1 set of 4 chained 500W units plugged into separate sockets
or is there a limitation of 4 units per house?</b></p>
<p>The 4-unit limit is such that the maximum rated current (usually
15A) is not exceeded for the wall socket you are plugging the Solar Liberator
array into.  You can have multiple sets
of 4 units plugged in – as long as each set plug into a different breaker circuit
and you do not exceed the max current of the circuit.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>6. I don’t completely
understand how the unit will power my house by being plugged into an outlet, is
there anywhere that explains this properly?  Is this power available throughout the house?</b></p>
<p>When you plug the 500W Solar Liberator unit in to a wall
socket, the unit will feed the generated solar power into your home’s
electrical network, just like the power line that comes to your house from your
utility Company. This is achieved by the grid-tie circuitry built-in to the
Solar Liberator unit. Therefore the power that is fed into the household
network in this way can be drawn from any other socket in the house or even
flow back onto the grid (if you have net metering setup with your utility company,
you could get credited for the excess power that flows back to the grid).</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>7. How durable are 500W
units to be in a purely outside environment?  Will
they be able to stand up to hail, heavy rain, snow, ice, freezing temperatures,
and high winds? How will freezing temperatures effect the internal battery and
the unit as a whole? </b></p>
<p>The Solar Liberator unit is made out of anodized Aluminum
with acrylic sheets covering the PV cells. It is designed to endure difficult
weather conditions such as heavy rain and snow, etc.  The battery and the electronics are housed in
a weather-proof casing.  The software
uses advanced thermal and charge management to ensure the longevity of the
battery and electronics.  The battery by
design can operate at temperatures down to -20 C (though performance may
deteriorate).</p>
<p>For extreme low temperatures though, we recommend removing
the batteries to minimize damage to the batteries.</p><p></p><p><b>8. How will it stand
up to high temperatures?  How does it
protect the batteries and electronics from heat?</b></p>
<p>The panels and the electronics themselves will operate at
50+ C. The internal structure and circuitry have sophisticated heat dissipation
mechanisms. But if the ambient temperature itself is above 40 C, the battery
will deliver minimal power as the software will keep things quiet to minimize
stress on the batteries.</p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>9. Has the mounting been
tested for high winds? What kind of wind speed can it handle?</b></p>
<p>The units and mounting has been tested for wind speeds of
50kmph/30 mph.</p>
<p>In areas where high winds and gusts over 80kmph/50mph are
common, we recommend mounting the units on the ground or using windbreaks and
the use of specialized reinforced mounting systems. </p>
<p><b>10. What kind/brand of
solar panels do you use in the 500W unit?</b></p>
<p>We do not use generic/branded solar panels. Solar Liberator
uses a 8 × 16 grid of standard 6inch crystalline Photo-voltaic cells that are
integrated into the unit and makes up the panel. Each of the 128 cells, has a
peak power output of 4.2W for a theoretical peak output close to 538W. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>11. For a roof installation
of the 500w units, can the installation be done by a homeowner, or do you
recommend an installer. Any specific installers you recommend?</b></p>
<p>Mounting the unit is straightforward and electrical setup is
as simple as plugging the cabling that runs from the unit into a wall socket. It
is reasonably assumed that this can be carried out by an adult familiar with
basic DIY work. If you are not comfortable with setting it up yourself, we
would recommend that you seek the assistance of a professional in your locality.</p><p></p><p><b>12. Do I have to have
net metering setup with my utility provider in order to use Solar Liberator?</b></p>

You do not have to have a net metering agreement
with your utility provider.  But if you
do have a net metering agreement, the excess power that flows from your home to
the grid will get metered as well and be credited by your utility company.  If you do not have net metering setup, and the
units generate more power than you are consuming, no power will be drawn from
the grid and your meter would come to a halt.<br/>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>13. How much does the
500W unit weigh?</b></p>
<p>The 500W panel weighs 20kg with battery of which the battery
weighs 8kg.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>14. Is there a need
to replace the internal battery pack when they die? Can we unplug it on the
unit?</b></p>
<p>All Solar Liberator units can function without the battery
pack. The battery pack will enhance performance of the unit though, with evened-out,
smooth power delivery as the sunshine fluctuates and by providing backup power
when the sun does not shine at all.</p>
<p>Batteries can be easily removed or replaced. Replacement batteries
will be available once the deliveries start.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>15. Will the unit
function fine with the “computer” resetting each time the sunlight is lost or
would “grid” tied models have some way of trickling power to the main board to
keep things going?</b></p>
<p>The microcontroller we use is a very low powered component
that can draw power from any of the power sources available (solar panels,
battery and grid). If all power sources are lost, it will reset and recover on
power being regained.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>16. What is level of
configuration that the software allows for the user? Can we activate/deactivate
the batteries?  </b></p>
<p>The software does not allow battery configuration in order
to keep things simple for the user. The software does everything intelligently
to achieve the best balance in performance, longevity and overall health of the
unit.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>17. I would love to
get more information about your Li-Ion batteries?</b></p>
<p>The Li-ion battery is a sealed battery cartridge that
consists of 128 standard Li-ion 18650 2,350 mAh battery cell with voltage level
of 3.7V. The battery charging and thermal cycles are controlled by the internal
software, which is part of the innovation in Solar Liberator, and is optimized
for best performance and battery life.</p><p></p><p><b>18. It would also be
great to get info on the extra batteries. What would be the max battery

<p>Additional batteries will be available once deliveries
start. The unit comes with a single 1kWh battery cartridge. But the unit can
house up to 4 batteries giving you 4 kWh of storage, which is enough to draw
peak power for 8 continuous hours.</p>

500W unit also supports connecting up external
Lead-acid battery banks to expand storage capacity even more.<br/><p></p><p><b>19. How easy is it to
integrate an external battery bank into the system with all the other
components continuing to function properly?</b></p>
<p>The 500W unit supports connecting external Lead-acid battery
banks using the high current DC terminals provided in the unit. Solar Liberator
will automatically integrate the external battery bank into its energy
management scheme.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>20. What is the hardware
that is inside the unit? Do you use open hardware such as Nanode, Raspberry Pi,
etc? </b></p>
<p>While we are fully supportive of open architecture, the
hardware inside the Solar Liberator is proprietary and we do not use open hardware.
The reason for this is primarily the safety critical nature of the devices, hence
minimizing unneeded complication. In addition, if the hardware/firmware was
user modifiable this may invalidate certification.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>21. Have you
considered adding a NIC, using DHCP, for easier configuration? How do we enter
the SSID and password for local wireless network?</b></p>
<p>There is a built-in WiFi NIC which connects to your local wireless
network and configures using DHCP. Administrative configuration interface for
Solar Liberator is accessed via Bluetooth, where you can configure the units to
use a specific wireless network with SSID/password.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>22. Will we have
control of the “data” or is it all going to a central cloud?</b></p>
<p>Yes – you absolutely have control over whether the data

We are now working hard on building our first fully complete pre-production units. Your support will be used to take Solar Liberator into production and delivery. The funds raised will be used for...

 Production tooling and mold creation costs


 Designing the supply chain process


 Manufacturing and meeting minimum order quantity requirements of our manufacturers


 Packaging design and sourcing


 Certification costs (UL 1741, UL 498, UL 943 & FCC certification)

 Setting up delivery and support channels
With your help, we can make Solar Liberator available to you and millions of others who would otherwise not have been able to enjoy the many benefits of solar power.1. What kind of setup does it require?Solar Liberator does not require any setup at all. It is fully integrated and functional straight away out of the packaging. You can simply place it where sunlight falls and it will start generating power. Connecting the 500W Solar Liberator to your home is as simple as plugging it into a wall socket.2. Does it work in gloomy weather?On overcast days where there is reasonable cloud cover, the power capacity can drop but with the battery backup it could sustain a consistent supply. 3. What happens on rainy days?On rainy days the solar irradiance is much lower than on a sunny day, and hence the amount of energy generated by your Solar Liberator will be much less than normal. Nevertheless, depending on the capacity and charge level of the batteries of your Solar Liberator, you can continue drawing power from it as normal.4. Can I use it at night?The battery pack that comes with the unit will be sufficient to keep it functional for up to 2 hours at full capacity. If the power being drawn from the unit is less, it will last longer. It is also possible to add more battery units to enhance the use of the unit at night, in gloomy weather, etc.5. Why is Solar Liberator different from other solar power solutions?Most of the solar power generation units out there are commercial solutions for which you need to hire a contractor who will assemble the system at your premises and wire it into your house! These systems will cost you anywhere from $15,000 to $50,000 upfront. These solutions are sometimes a good choice if you think you will need over 10KW of power.Solar Liberator is designed to be the right choice if your needs are below 10KW (which is the vast majority of households) or if you want to slowly transition to solar energy one step at a time without committing to a large system upfront. Further, Solar Liberator’s portable, flexible and extensible design and fully integrated packaging makes it the most sensible choice if you want to add solar power to non traditional living spaces and vehicles such as boats, caravans, mobile homes, sheds, etc..On the other end you have small DC only low power solar panels that sometimes succeed in charging your phone etc.. but generally these are nothing more than toys or junk that gets thrown away or forgotten after sometime.6. What about warranty of the components?The high grade poly-crystalline PV cells come with 25 year warranty from the original manufacturers. Each Solar Liberator unit will carry a 5-year materials and workmanship warranty which includes the electronics. The minimum design lifespan for the electronics is 10 years, but should last much longer. The included Li-ion batteries are designed to last 5 years by the use of advanced software optimized charging cycles and thermal dissipation control. They are warranted for a minimum of one year.7. How can I claim Federal and state benefits for renewable energy when I get a Solar Liberator?With the 500W Solar Liberator, you should be entitled to claim the 30% federal tax credit and also may be eligible to claim various other state and federal benefits for renewable energy. Prior to delivery, we will convert your Indiegogo contribution into a purchase and provide you with the necessary invoices and documents that will enable you to claim these benefits.
1. Do Solar Liberator
units work with European and other international electrical systems as well as
the US?
Absolutely. The portable units (25W and 100W) have a voltage
selector switch to select the output voltage/frequency. The socket panel in
these units will come with appropriate A/C sockets according to your delivery address.
For example the units shipped to the US will contain Type B (NEMA 5-15) A/C
sockets, whereas units shipped to the UK will contain Type G (BS 1363) sockets.

Similarly, the 500W unit will be supplied with a plug that
is compatible with your local standards. The grid-tie capability in the 500W
unit detects the voltage/frequency of the grid supply it is connected to, and outputs
power to your home’s electrical network with the exact same voltage/frequency/phase
(from 100V -250V and 50/60 Hz).
2. What precautions
are taken to prevent the 500W unit from reverse feeding power output when the
grid supply is down?
In grid-tie mode, Solar Liberator will shut down power output
if the grid supply goes down, to prevent reverse feeding. This is a requirement
for the UL 1741/IEEE 1547 certification which is the standard required by most
utility companies for equipment that feeds power into their grids.
3. Can the 500 watt
units be used off-grid? 
There are two separate outlets for grid-tie and ‘Always On’ off-grid
output. This is for safety and to prevent accidentally connecting the wrong
output to the grid. The grid-tie output can simply be plugged into a wall
socket using the provided cable, whereas you need to draw cabling and connect
up the off-grid output terminals via a transfer switch that disconnects the
grid when operational. 
4. How does the unit know
to output power when connected to a transfer switch that has triggered due to
utility grid failure? Wouldn’t the unit still believe it was in island protect
mode?
The grid tie output will shut down when the utility supply goes
down. If you have wired the ‘Always On’ off-grid out put through a transfer
switch, when the transfer switch triggers, then your house will be supplied
power from the ‘Always On’ output, and is isolated from the grid. 
5. I saw that 4 is
the maximum number of 500W panels that can be chained. Does this mean you can
also have more than 1 set of 4 chained 500W units plugged into separate sockets
or is there a limitation of 4 units per house?
The 4-unit limit is such that the maximum rated current (usually
15A) is not exceeded for the wall socket you are plugging the Solar Liberator
array into.  You can have multiple sets
of 4 units plugged in – as long as each set plug into a different breaker circuit
and you do not exceed the max current of the circuit.
6. I don’t completely
understand how the unit will power my house by being plugged into an outlet, is
there anywhere that explains this properly?  Is this power available throughout the house?
When you plug the 500W Solar Liberator unit in to a wall
socket, the unit will feed the generated solar power into your home’s
electrical network, just like the power line that comes to your house from your
utility Company. This is achieved by the grid-tie circuitry built-in to the
Solar Liberator unit. Therefore the power that is fed into the household
network in this way can be drawn from any other socket in the house or even
flow back onto the grid (if you have net metering setup with your utility company,
you could get credited for the excess power that flows back to the grid).
7. How durable are 500W
units to be in a purely outside environment?  Will
they be able to stand up to hail, heavy rain, snow, ice, freezing temperatures,
and high winds? How will freezing temperatures effect the internal battery and
the unit as a whole? 
The Solar Liberator unit is made out of anodized Aluminum
with acrylic sheets covering the PV cells. It is designed to endure difficult
weather conditions such as heavy rain and snow, etc.  The battery and the electronics are housed in
a weather-proof casing.  The software
uses advanced thermal and charge management to ensure the longevity of the
battery and electronics.  The battery by
design can operate at temperatures down to -20 C (though performance may
deteriorate).
For extreme low temperatures though, we recommend removing
the batteries to minimize damage to the batteries.8. How will it stand
up to high temperatures?  How does it
protect the batteries and electronics from heat?
The panels and the electronics themselves will operate at
50+ C. The internal structure and circuitry have sophisticated heat dissipation
mechanisms. But if the ambient temperature itself is above 40 C, the battery
will deliver minimal power as the software will keep things quiet to minimize
stress on the batteries.9. Has the mounting been
tested for high winds? What kind of wind speed can it handle?
The units and mounting has been tested for wind speeds of
50kmph/30 mph.
In areas where high winds and gusts over 80kmph/50mph are
common, we recommend mounting the units on the ground or using windbreaks and
the use of specialized reinforced mounting systems. 
10. What kind/brand of
solar panels do you use in the 500W unit?
We do not use generic/branded solar panels. Solar Liberator
uses a 8 × 16 grid of standard 6inch crystalline Photo-voltaic cells that are
integrated into the unit and makes up the panel. Each of the 128 cells, has a
peak power output of 4.2W for a theoretical peak output close to 538W. 
11. For a roof installation
of the 500w units, can the installation be done by a homeowner, or do you
recommend an installer. Any specific installers you recommend?
Mounting the unit is straightforward and electrical setup is
as simple as plugging the cabling that runs from the unit into a wall socket. It
is reasonably assumed that this can be carried out by an adult familiar with
basic DIY work. If you are not comfortable with setting it up yourself, we
would recommend that you seek the assistance of a professional in your locality.12. Do I have to have
net metering setup with my utility provider in order to use Solar Liberator?

You do not have to have a net metering agreement
with your utility provider.  But if you
do have a net metering agreement, the excess power that flows from your home to
the grid will get metered as well and be credited by your utility company.  If you do not have net metering setup, and the
units generate more power than you are consuming, no power will be drawn from
the grid and your meter would come to a halt.
13. How much does the
500W unit weigh?
The 500W panel weighs 20kg with battery of which the battery
weighs 8kg.
14. Is there a need
to replace the internal battery pack when they die? Can we unplug it on the
unit?
All Solar Liberator units can function without the battery
pack. The battery pack will enhance performance of the unit though, with evened-out,
smooth power delivery as the sunshine fluctuates and by providing backup power
when the sun does not shine at all.
Batteries can be easily removed or replaced. Replacement batteries
will be available once the deliveries start.
15. Will the unit
function fine with the “computer” resetting each time the sunlight is lost or
would “grid” tied models have some way of trickling power to the main board to
keep things going?
The microcontroller we use is a very low powered component
that can draw power from any of the power sources available (solar panels,
battery and grid). If all power sources are lost, it will reset and recover on
power being regained.
16. What is level of
configuration that the software allows for the user? Can we activate/deactivate
the batteries?  
The software does not allow battery configuration in order
to keep things simple for the user. The software does everything intelligently
to achieve the best balance in performance, longevity and overall health of the
unit.
17. I would love to
get more information about your Li-Ion batteries?
The Li-ion battery is a sealed battery cartridge that
consists of 128 standard Li-ion 18650 2,350 mAh battery cell with voltage level
of 3.7V. The battery charging and thermal cycles are controlled by the internal
software, which is part of the innovation in Solar Liberator, and is optimized
for best performance and battery life.18. It would also be
great to get info on the extra batteries. What would be the max battery
storage for the 500W unit?
Additional batteries will be available once deliveries

house up to 4 batteries giving you 4 kWh of storage, which is enough to draw
peak power for 8 continuous hours.

500W unit also supports connecting up external
Lead-acid battery banks to expand storage capacity even more.19. How easy is it to
integrate an external battery bank into the system with all the other
components continuing to function properly?
The 500W unit supports connecting external Lead-acid battery
banks using the high current DC terminals provided in the unit. Solar Liberator
will automatically integrate the external battery bank into its energy
management scheme.
20. What is the hardware
that is inside the unit? Do you use open hardware such as Nanode, Raspberry Pi,

the SSID and password for local wireless network?
There is a built-in WiFi NIC which connects to your local wireless
network and configures using DHCP. Administrative configuration interface for
Solar Liberator is accessed via Bluetooth, where you can configure the units to
use a specific wireless network with SSID/password.
22. Will we have
control of the “data” or is it all going to a central cloud?
Yes – you absolutely have control over whether the data
gathered by the internal software ever leaves the boundaries of your privacy. You
have the option to enable/ disable ‘Anywhere Monitoring’, which works via our
servers and accessed via the smart phone app.",44.0,0,"1 Campaign

Most food truck renovations cost tens of thousands of dollars, but seeing as electricity is all I need for my refrigerators, I’ve opted for the more economical route: installing the equipment myself.Any amount you can give would help immensely and be greatly appreciated. Buying the truck is the biggest hurdle of this entire process so with your help, we can all sit back, relax, and sip a refreshing Key Lime Water.. Or Strawberry Lemon Water… or Passion Fruit tea! RISKS AND CHALLENGESThere are always risks when it comes to the food industry, but what it ultimately comes down to is a delicious menu at the right price point. Moreover, Beachside Squeeze is a very different concept for an area saturated with deep fried and high calorie options. However, I know that with my trendy branding and healthy choices, beach goers will come to appreciate the unique concept.My ideal location is Canova Beach where dogs are allowed to roam and where there’s plenty of foot traffic. There is much to navigate when it comes to local permitting at Canova Beach, which is the main reason for the lack of food trucks in the area, however it is possible. If for some reason the permitting at Canova doesn’t work out for me, there are plenty of other beaches nearby that are easier to gain permit approval. Those areas will require a bit more creativity on my part in building a customer base, but it’s nothing I can’t handle. OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELPI understand that not everyone is able to contribute financially to this project. However, I would be very thankful for your support and encouragement. Please share this on your social media pages and email EVERYONE you know. Look for the share tools at the top of this campaign. You can also follow the development of Beachside Squeeze on Facebook and Instagram. With your help, we can make this happen! THANK YOU!   THANK YOU!   THANK YOU!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>TL;DR/DW - We are people who nerd out over good coffee and want to bring that passion to the wonderful city of Yakima while creating a culture of love and beautiful community!</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>So... What is Happening Here?</h3>
<p>My wife, Alaena and I have always been coffee snobs of sorts. We frequent new shops wherever we go to enjoy the experience. We have worked in the coffee industry for roughly 16 years collectively ranging from Starbucks to independent shops. We have always dreamed about starting our own shop! Back in the fall of 2018 I began work at a shop in Portland called Haven Coffee Co. We had been long time customers that love the family (Jerry, Jane, Nate and Ariel Bennett) that own and operate the shop. I reached out to Nate and told him my heart about learning more about coffee so that one day I could use that experience to do my own. They brought me on board with them and since then I have been learning so much about the industry from an owner's point of view and continue to gain knowledge that will impact Alaena and my own coffee business someday. In March 2020, Haven shut it's doors due to COVID-19. The owners decided to make the most of their down time and broke ground on a full remodel of the shop. Luckily, I was brought back on during this time to help with the remodel. While I was working on the remodel, Alaena and I really started to envision starting our own shop in the near future. After a lot of prayer and brainstorming we began to seriously consider venturing out and starting our own shop we both felt that God is leading us to take a step of faith to make our dream reality.</p>
<p>After making the decision to move forward we started to ask the big questions like, where do we build our community and where do we open a business and what do we call ourselves? Portland is the coffee mecca making it is extremely difficult to open something new in a place that is so over saturated. So we thought through locations such as Beaverton, Tigard, Hillsboro, Sherwood and Bethany (all locations fairly close to where we live now). As we went down the list we began to mark them off due to either the location being too close to an already established shop or just not the best location for a shop. That is when I started to think about outside of Portland. A place we already know and a place that is growing year after year and doesn’t really have the “designer” coffee experience already...Yakima Washington! We lived there for a time when we took over the youth group at the Yakima Vineyard Church. Yakima has always been a place of family and community for us where we have so much support. We discussed where a good place would be and what it could look like. One day we started thinking about the Yakima Vineyard as a possible shop location. The church building is a beautiful 100+ year old building  with a lot of space and it has a café already built into the side of it.  When we brought the proposal to the team at the church we got a green light. Now with a door open we began the discussion about what would we call our little shop? As we pondered what we want to stand for and what we want our impact to be we came to Catalyst Coffee Co. The word catalyst fits our mission as a shop driven towards community and ministry. We strongly desire to have a deep impact on the community in Yakima. </p>
<p>Now this is where you come in! We are launching this Indiegogo as a way to help us start funding our way to our grand opening such as the remodel and business related issues. We want you to partner with us on this adventure and support us as we fight for our dream.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Remodel costs and initial living costs will be the primary until we open the doors in the (hopefully) early fall. We need to have some funds on hand to start moving forward. We will need to obtain the proper equipment, and supplies. We will be able to do the majority of the work ourselves with the help of a couple friends that work in the construction industry. We are aiming to keep the startup  costs fairly low.</p>
<p>With your donations you will be able choose from different perks. i.e. cups, shirts, hoodies, discounts and more! We have lined up some pretty sweet merch that we think you will enjoy.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We believe that Yakima is a place where we can truly make an impact in the coffee community. Yakima is known for their hops, fruit, and breweries but we would love to add coffee to that list.</p>
<p>Why us? Not only being coffee ""snobs"" we also have work collectively in the industry for 16ish years. Be it from managing in the corporate coffee world or just being a barista at a little hole in the wall. We have been around and know a thing or two about this thing. Outside of the coffee world we have worked for other well know businesses that have taught us a thing or two about the business world as well. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We understand that this is an interesting time to open a new business. Relocating our family and starting a small business in a rather crazy time is a risk in and of itself. However, we have a large support group already advocating for us to succeed.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Of course we would love and appreciate everyone to give to this but we also are realists and understand that this is a difficult time. Another way you can support us is by sharing this with your friends and family or on Facebook, instagram, tiktok(ha), Linkedin, Twitter, vine, AIM, and email. </p>

Because of the lack of opportunities, most communities in the region feel they must choose one or the other, as they have few options to accomplish both. Mosqoy works with Quechua communities to achieve a future where they are not forced to choose. Instead, Mosqoy presents community members with viable economic opportunities that can co-exist with the continuation of traditional ways of life. This is the central focus of Mosqoy’s work.</span></span></p>

What is the challenge that Mosqoy needs help with?
In the Cusco region of the Peruvian Andes, indigenous Quechua communities face a challenging decision: to develop economically towards a prosperous future or to revitalize their unique yet threatened culture. Because of the lack of opportunities, most communities in the region feel they must choose one or the other, as they have few options to accomplish both. Mosqoy works with Quechua communities to achieve a future where they are not forced to choose. Instead, Mosqoy presents community members with viable economic opportunities that can co-exist with the continuation of traditional ways of life. This is the central focus of Mosqoy’s work.

How is Mosqoy Creating a Positive Impact?

Andean Youth Program
Our goal is to assist in creating a positive generation of leaders, for the future of these communities. Through our Andean Youth Program, we’ve funded over 60 students from rural communities to attend post-secondary education. Our current students are now studying various trades in the nearest city of Cusco, to be able to eventually return to their communities, become employed, and give back through both skills and resources. They have immense potential to become positive role models for the next generation, and to turn this vicious cycle into a positive one. All they need are resources and encouragement.
Textile Revitalization Program
We support over 150 weavers to sell their traditional textiles at fair-trade marketplaces. These textiles are unique works of art and rich sources of Quechua heritage and wisdom. They act as a history book, documenting Quechua values, beliefs, and stories. Much like the salmon is a keystone species in biology, these textiles are a keystone species for their culture. Profits from sales support the Andean Youth Program, as well as socioeconomic development projects chosen by the communities, such as building compostable toilets and creating communal weaving centres.
Global Stewardship Program
Mosqoy works with elementary schools, high schools, and universities in North America to raise awareness and inspire future generations to become globally aware and responsible youth. These are, after all, the next backpackers and consumers of the world. If they do not know how to positively impact the communities they encounter, they may inadvertently cause negative impacts. Our goal is to build global stewardship and compassion, to shift globalization towards more positive outcomes.
 

Why We Need Your Help

Our programs have tripled in the last 7 years, and the passion and dedication of our volunteers is no longer enough to maintain our sustainability.

We are now supporting approximately 150 weavers and over 60 students in 15 highland communities of the Andean mountains. And there is a wait-list.


 

 
What will we do with your donation?
With $15,000, we can expand our programs AND create long-term positive change in the following ways:
1.     Hire staff in Peru to maintain our programs.
Our staff in Peru fill an irreplacable role in the lives of our students: they act as mentors, leaders, and sources of inspiration. We need to secure their funding to make sure our students can continue to benefit from their support.
2.       Expand our retail network and set up an online store
We have the supply and the demand. We just need the capital to be able to buy more weavings from our network of artists, to provide a steadier and more guaranteed source of income. With this, we can expand our outlets from fairs and festivals, to retail stores, boutiques, museums, and our very own online store. 
3.       Create a Short Documentary Video
 
The documentary will focus on our work in Peru, letting Mosqoy alumni and Quechua weavers speak for themselves. The film will also offer rare insight into the lifestyle and traditions of remote Andean communities.

4.       Kickstart our social enterprise programs
 
Mosqoy’s new social enterprises include partnering with retailers to expand our textile revitalization project and organizing educational tours for high-school students. These social enterprises will enable our programs to become more self-sustainable, as we’ll be able to fund our own programs.
 
5.      Put more energy into our programs, less into fundraising.
 
What have we achieved so far? 


Over 60 students have been funded, and 27 have graduated, becoming nurses, eco-tourism guides and government employees.


150 weavers have benefitted from selling their textiles fair-trade, using the funds to support their communities' own goals towards sustainable development.
 



More Reasons to Support Us
The Mosqoy model is designed to become self-sustainable through the communities we work with in Peru. Mosqoy Alumni will re-invest into the education fund after graduation, supporting future generations of students. Weavers will gradually set up enough capacity to develop local markets. With enough textile sales and program graduates, the youth of these communities will be running Mosqoy themselves! 
We are frugal and will use every dollar wisely.  For 7 years we have done a lot with very little; we know every low-cost alternative out there and have learned the most effective ways to make a lot of positive change happen.
We are a registered Canadian charitable organization. Meaning that we’re held accountable to our work.

I want to share this feeling with everyone.</p><p>The intersection of my community work and love of comics got me thinking: How many people who are queer or trans (or are bad ass cis accomplices) love comics and inclusive storylines but feel like they can’t share it with anyone in real time?</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498655078/woxfthmkvtbzooy9wxng.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>In Charlotte, there aren’t enough inclusive in-person spaces.

For us, by us.My name is Lara Americo and I’m a transgender activist, artist and musician living in Charlotte, NC. I’m passionate about creating inclusive, positive spaces for communities, which I’ve done through my work with The Freedom Center for Social Justice Center and other local organizations supporting queer and trans people of color for the past three years.On top of that, I’m a huge fan of reading and writing comics. Sequential art tells stories in a way that books can’t. In graphic novels and comic books, you have an intersection of art and writing that you don’t see in any other medium. Something powerful happens in that short moment when you see the expression on a character's face and you read their dialog. You can feel what the character is thinking. You become the character. I want to share this feeling with everyone.The intersection of my community work and love of comics got me thinking: How many people who are queer or trans (or are bad ass cis accomplices) love comics and inclusive storylines but feel like they can’t share it with anyone in real time?In Charlotte, there aren’t enough inclusive in-person spaces. And there’s a large population of underserved LGBTQ people: Nearly 90,000 LGBTQ people live in the Charlotte metro area, and 3.3 percent of people in North Carolina identify as gay, lesbian or transgender. That’s only the people who feel safe enough to publicly identify themselves in these surveys (via Gallup and UCLA Williams Institute Survey).Even though we’re considered a metropolitan city and have this population, there aren’t enough inclusive spaces. Charlotte doesn’t have a LGBTQ Community Center. Charlotte “gayborhoods” are disappearing because of gentrification. Local comics events are generally geared towards cisgender white men and other communities are an afterthought.The reality is: We won’t have any inclusive spaces unless we create them for ourselves.This is why I’ve created Comic Girl Coffee & Books, a space to read, share comics, build community, and drink fresh, local coffee. There will also be food for sale along with books and other products. I’ve found a space for the coffee shop, but I need an extra push to officially launch it!The PlanI’m looking to fund initial start-up costs. This includes licensing and business fees, improvements on the space, decorations and furniture, initial inventory and equipment. Your contribution will also fund the following items to get this place opened:
Espresso machine
Coffee
Comics
Local pastries
Cold brew from Pure Intentions
Security deposit for first month’s rent
Business License
My plan is to open two pop-up locations in Petra’s Piano Bar and Advent CoWorking as a way to subsidize funding for a permanent location at Area 15. Area 15 is a DIY, small business incubator with a reputation for developing businesses. I plan to open my first location here as long as I can pay the security deposit and get the above items.Comic Girl Coffee & Books will:
Source coffee and tea from local roasters and fair trade organic suppliers.
Source food from people of color, trans, queer, femme and immigrant providers.
Create a safe, joyful space for community comic book and coffee lovers.
The long-term plan for Comic Girl Coffee & Books is to expand as big as our community
 In the future, as we grow, here are the benefits coming from Comic Girl Coffee: 
Provide marginalized people with a way to create their own income and be a part of a badass business.
Support the transgender homeless shelter Trans.formation House in Charlotte, which is projected to open in early 2018. A percentage of profits from Comic Girl Coffee & Books will go toward supporting marginalized people through employee/owner opportunities and supporting Trans.formation House.
Work towards understanding oppression and anti-oppression and have literature available to support this. Sliding scale pricing will ensure people can access information about collective organizing, sustainable housing, homesteading and other topics even if they can’t afford it -- and some of our comic books.
Events can also take place in the space that benefit the community. Community organizers will be able to hold events like fundraisers and meetings.
Let’s make this happen! Comic Girl Coffee & Books will be the place for people who want to laugh and share their love of comics and inclusive stories over coffee. Building community in Charlotte is crucial, and I’d love for us to do that together.If you have any other questions about this project, please reach out to me.

<h3>The Bonton Food Desert and Our Aquaponics  System</h3>
<p></p>
<p>You have the opportunity to make an impact for a community in need. It will empower them to stand up against hunger and provide a healthy lifestyle for generations to come! Please come alongside us so that we can make a difference together!</p>
<p>The neighborhood of Bonton is one of the worst food deserts in Dallas and the US. That means that at least 500 people or at least 33 percent of the census tract's 
population resides more than one mile from a supermarket or large 
grocery store without the means to travel.
 For a Bonton resident to get groceries, they must take a bus for 1.5 
hours, do their shopping, and haul their groceries 1.5 hours back. There
 simply isn't healthy food within the geographic and economic grasp 
of a ""Bontonian."" Thus, most grow up eating packaged snacks and french 
fries from the local beer&amp;wine store and are suffering the health 
consequences. I met a man dying of kidney and heart failure at 41, and 
another going blind from diabetes in his 40's, not because of hereditary
 issues. Rather, they have had terrible nutrition since their birth. 
Quite a perdicament, right? Bonton's residents and HIS BridgeBuilders 
refuse to wait until somebody else solves their problem. They are 
embracing a plethora of urban farming techniques, one of which is 
aquaponics. Aquaponics is a system in
 which the waste produced by fish supplies nutrients for plants grown 
hydroponically, which in turn purifies the water for the original fish. 
It is an efficient system that has huge potential in helping this 
community! Here is a picture:</p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/82615/files/20130918151304-IMG_4650.JPG?1379542384"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>The first aquaponics system built in this community 
has been an enormous success. Many residents are working on it and 
reaping the benefits of its produce. The community is excited about how 
this can help provide healthy and affordable food for their families. 
However, with winter coming, the aquaponics system needs to be 
winterized by mid-October. That is where you come in!<br/></p>
<p>By investing in this project, you will be an important part in our quest to saturate Bonton with fresh healthy food. We are using unique urban farming techniques to give fresh fruit and vegetables to Bonton's residents and to teach them how to replicate these systems for their families. One of these techniques is aquaponics, defined as ""a system of aquaculture in which the waste produced by farmed fish supplies nutrients for plants grown hydroponically, which in turn purify the water."" The aquaponics system has provided much needed produce to many in the community. However, the system will be extremely disadvantaged and almost completely fruitless (and vegetabless ;) if it is not protected against the coming winter weather. We desperately need to construct a greenhouse around our aquaponics system and winterize it to ensure year-around production. Your contribution will be a vital part of our success!</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to continue providing this urban farming aquaponics system to the community throughout the winter. To that end, we need a greenhouse, a heater and other winterizing equipment to ensure the fish and produce from the system can continue to provide fresh, easily accessible, and healthy food to Bonton's residents. To pay for the equipment, labor, and cost of transacting here, we need $10,000. Here is a preliminary drawing of what the greenhouse will look like!</p>

<p>In order to keep with our theme of community restoration, we will acquire most of our building materials from Habitat Home restorations in the community. Furthermore, the building process of this greenhouse will intentionally include members of the community. They will be taught throughout the project and will take charge in some of the work. Furthermore, they will be some of the many beneficiaries of the system's produce.</p>
<p>We are committed to spending this money with integrity and wisdom (so much to do and so little resources to do it!). So, if we do raise more than our goal, 100% of all funds will enable other vital community farming projects.

And needless to say … we will need lots of new equipment to take care of all of you! 

What is Edgar and why help us with this expansion?Edgar makes the neighbourhood, city, and province proud. This tiny, chef-owned restaurant has often made the cover of magazines and graced the pages of newspapers and cookbooks. Chef Marysol won gold at the 2013 Gold Medal Plates culinary competition and continued on to place fourth at the 2014 Canadian Culinary Championships. Edgar has been featured on the Food Network’s You Gotta Eat Here, with Vincent Graton in Le Goût du Pays, and alongside Benoit Roberge in Sur le Pouce. Chef Marysol also participated in Chuck’s Hughes televised culinary competition À Couteaux Tirés. Last but, not least, in 2017 Chef Marysol hosted her own 13 episodes cooking show, Les menus Zeste, on Zeste TV. 

Edgar is proud of its community involvement—we love The Breakfast Club, Harmony House, the Canadian Cancer Society, The Heart and Stroke Foundation (The Heart Institute), Moisson Outaouais, Ten Oaks, Cultivating Cooks, the Ottawa Food Bank, as well as, volunteering and mentoring in schools lucky enough to have a culinary program. In 2016 and 2017 Marysol has also been an official spokesperson for the Egg Farmers of Canada.
We need your help to make this project a reality. Thanks to you, Edgar will soon be able to welcome you with big(ger) open arms!

Trinity grad to return to Manchester for ‘Fun Run’

MANCHESTER -- BRIAN SMITH joined his family and friends at Lake Winnipesaukee this past weekend, as he has for years, but the 6-foot former marathoner now has to watch from shore when everyone else boards the boats to go out on the lake.

</h3><p><b><i>MERCI A TOUS LES GÉNÉREUX CONTRIBUTEURS ! Nous avons atteint le premier objectif, mais CE N'EST PAS FINI ! Nous avons lancé en parallèle une collecte au Mexique et avons récolté pour 6 mois. Si nous atteignons 5 000 euros en France, nous aurons de quoi payer deux années de scolarité !</i></b></p><p><b><i>LUPE ET MAYA</i></b></p>
<p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432308907/bdngtv8rtabnbxd2x27e.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>Lupe a 6 ans et un sourire ravageur ; Maya, 7 ans et le
charme d’une petite biche. Voilà trois ans déjà que nous côtoyons chaque jour
ces deux rayons de soleil nés dans un bidonville mexicain.Toutes deux sont des <b>indiennes mazahuas</b> et parlent aussi bien l'espagnol que leur dialecte, une drôle de langue qui rappelle le japonais. </p>
<p>Depuis la vieille Europe, on imagine que les enfants des <i>barrios</i> grandissent dans la violence, la
drogue et l’abandon. C'est loin d’être toujours le cas. Lupe et Maya ont beau travailler le week-end dans les rues pour vendre du bois ou des tissus brodés par
leur grand-mère, ce sont des enfants aimées et entourées. Avec leur coiffure toujours impeccable et leurs bonnes manières qui en ont déjà surpris plus d'un, elles observent avec émerveillement ce qui se passe autour d'elles et ne se lassent jamais de poser des questions. Certes, elles vivent avec toute leur famille dans une seule pièce, elles mangent des tortillas matin, midi et soir et se douchent avec un seau d'eau froide, mais c'est aussi ce qui leur donne le sens des réalités et surtout de la force.</p>
<p>Vous l’aurez compris : l’intelligence, l’assurance, la gaieté
de ces deux petites filles brûlantes de curiosité nous ont séduits. Alors, au
fil des mois, nous avons pris goût à leur apprendre à lire et à écrire, à leur donner de quoi dessiner, à
jouer aussi… Seulement voilà, en août dernier, Lupe et Maya sont entrées à
l’école, fières comme Artaban, prêtes à dévorer le monde. 
Mais l’école publique ici, ce n’est pas une panacée: cinquante-cinq enfants par classe, souvent pas de
cahier et des cours de 13h30 à 18h tous les jours. Si vous ajoutez que, selon une étude récente de l'OCDE, 17 000 instituteurs dans le pays savent à peine lire et écrire...</p><p>Les chiffres sont alarmants. <b>Sur 100 élèves qui entrent en CP, seuls 35 finissent l'école primaire. Quant aux enfants indigènes, 3% d'entre eux seulement parviennent à terminer le lycée. </b></p><p>Maya et Lupe font de leur mieux, s’appliquent à l’école, ne manquent jamais de préparer leurs devoirs, mais dans ces conditions, leur avenir est déjà compromis. Dans <b>un pays qui enregistre parmi les plus forts taux d'inégalité au monde</b>, pour qu'un enfant pauvre puisse s'en sortir, il n'y a qu'une seule solution: l'envoyer dans une école privée. </p>
<p><b><i>LE PROJET</i></b></p><p><b><i></i></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432308393/mfdkqty6ifex0ywqwi6g.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Nous avons donc décidé d’<b>aider Maya et Lupe à entrer à la Escuela Valle de Bravo, une école bilingue espagnol-anglais </b>avec une ambiance familiale et des
professeurs aussi attentifs qu’exigeants. Les propriétaires de l’école, après
quatre jours d’essai, ont accepté de donner <b>une bourse</b> à nos deux petites
protégées . C’est une grande première ! </p><p></p><h3></h3><p>Directeurs, instituteurs, parents d’élèves, tous sont conscients de l’importance symbolique de l’entrée de Lupe et Maya dans ce petit paradis de l’éducation. Dans une société classiste et raciste, l’arrivée de deux indiennes dans des classes où la majorité des enfants ont le teint clair et des origines européennes est un chamboulement. Tous sont prêts à aider nos deux pionnières à s’intégrer tout en gardant les pieds sur terre. Tous considèrent que c’est une chance pour les autres élèves de prendre si tôt conscience de la diversité.</p><p>Plusieurs parents d’élèves ont déjà par exemple organisé une collecte d'uniformes déjà usés mais encore en bon état pour les offrir à Maya et Lupe. La future institutrice de Maya a proposé de lui donner gratuitement quelques cours de remise à niveau en mathématiques. </p>
<p>Certes, l’idéal serait de changer radicalement le système éducatif
au Mexique, de se battre pour l’amélioration des écoles publiques et de faire
des campagnes contre le racisme, mais les petits ruisseaux font les grandes
rivières. Si Lupe et Maya dans quelques années parlent couramment anglais et
entrent à l’université, elles pourront alors défendre leur communauté. Si Lupe
et Maya s’avèrent être un exemple d’intégration réussie, d'autres personnes seront à l’évidence tentées de se lancer au Mexique dans un projet
similaire. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b><i>LE BUDGET</i></b></p>
<p>Nous avons besoin pour payer les frais de scolarité et le matériel
de <b>3 600 euros par an</b>, soit 1 800 euros par enfant. Vous trouverez la
répartition des frais ci-dessous. Les frais de scolarité seront immédiatement
payés à l’école pour bénéficier de 5% de remise supplémentaire et l’argent servant à payer matériel, livres et sorties, sera
déposé sur un compte en banque spécifique dont nous aurons seuls l’accès.  </p>
<p>Le père de Lupe et Maya, Ramon, s’est engagé à donner 400 pesos
par mois pour ses deux filles, l’équivalent de 25 euros. Il gagne 4500 pesos
par mois, a quatre enfants à nourrir et ne peut vraiment pas faire mieux. </p>
<p>De notre côté, nous nous engageons à accompagner quotidiennement nos deux petites voisines, à leur donner des cours de soutien, à les encourager, mais aussi à vous donner de leurs nouvelles régulièrement: nous pensons publier une vidéo tous les six mois et peut-être créer prochainement un blog !</p>
<p>La collecte devra être renouvelée chaque année pendant encore 5
ans minimum jusqu’à leur entrée au collège. Si la somme de 3 600 euros est
dépassée, l’argent sera conservé sur le compte en banque pendant un an afin de
payer les frais de scolarité de l’année prochaine !</p>

</div></div>","MERCI A TOUS LES GÉNÉREUX CONTRIBUTEURS ! Nous avons atteint le premier objectif, mais CE N'EST PAS FINI ! Nous avons lancé en parallèle une collecte au Mexique et avons récolté pour 6 mois. Si nous atteignons 5 000 euros en France, nous aurons de quoi payer deux années de scolarité !LUPE ET MAYA
Lupe a 6 ans et un sourire ravageur ; Maya, 7 ans et le
charme d’une petite biche. Voilà trois ans déjà que nous côtoyons chaque jour
ces deux rayons de soleil nés dans un bidonville mexicain.Toutes deux sont des indiennes mazahuas et parlent aussi bien l'espagnol que leur dialecte, une drôle de langue qui rappelle le japonais. 
Depuis la vieille Europe, on imagine que les enfants des barrios grandissent dans la violence, la
drogue et l’abandon. C'est loin d’être toujours le cas. Lupe et Maya ont beau travailler le week-end dans les rues pour vendre du bois ou des tissus brodés par
leur grand-mère, ce sont des enfants aimées et entourées. Avec leur coiffure toujours impeccable et leurs bonnes manières qui en ont déjà surpris plus d'un, elles observent avec émerveillement ce qui se passe autour d'elles et ne se lassent jamais de poser des questions. Certes, elles vivent avec toute leur famille dans une seule pièce, elles mangent des tortillas matin, midi et soir et se douchent avec un seau d'eau froide, mais c'est aussi ce qui leur donne le sens des réalités et surtout de la force.
Vous l’aurez compris : l’intelligence, l’assurance, la gaieté
de ces deux petites filles brûlantes de curiosité nous ont séduits. Alors, au
fil des mois, nous avons pris goût à leur apprendre à lire et à écrire, à leur donner de quoi dessiner, à
jouer aussi… Seulement voilà, en août dernier, Lupe et Maya sont entrées à
l’école, fières comme Artaban, prêtes à dévorer le monde. 
Mais l’école publique ici, ce n’est pas une panacée: cinquante-cinq enfants par classe, souvent pas de
cahier et des cours de 13h30 à 18h tous les jours. Si vous ajoutez que, selon une étude récente de l'OCDE, 17 000 instituteurs dans le pays savent à peine lire et écrire...Les chiffres sont alarmants. Sur 100 élèves qui entrent en CP, seuls 35 finissent l'école primaire. Quant aux enfants indigènes, 3% d'entre eux seulement parviennent à terminer le lycée. Maya et Lupe font de leur mieux, s’appliquent à l’école, ne manquent jamais de préparer leurs devoirs, mais dans ces conditions, leur avenir est déjà compromis. Dans un pays qui enregistre parmi les plus forts taux d'inégalité au monde, pour qu'un enfant pauvre puisse s'en sortir, il n'y a qu'une seule solution: l'envoyer dans une école privée. 
LE PROJET
Nous avons donc décidé d’aider Maya et Lupe à entrer à la Escuela Valle de Bravo, une école bilingue espagnol-anglais avec une ambiance familiale et des
professeurs aussi attentifs qu’exigeants. Les propriétaires de l’école, après
quatre jours d’essai, ont accepté de donner une bourse à nos deux petites
protégées . C’est une grande première ! Directeurs, instituteurs, parents d’élèves, tous sont conscients de l’importance symbolique de l’entrée de Lupe et Maya dans ce petit paradis de l’éducation. Dans une société classiste et raciste, l’arrivée de deux indiennes dans des classes où la majorité des enfants ont le teint clair et des origines européennes est un chamboulement. Tous sont prêts à aider nos deux pionnières à s’intégrer tout en gardant les pieds sur terre. Tous considèrent que c’est une chance pour les autres élèves de prendre si tôt conscience de la diversité.Plusieurs parents d’élèves ont déjà par exemple organisé une collecte d'uniformes déjà usés mais encore en bon état pour les offrir à Maya et Lupe. La future institutrice de Maya a proposé de lui donner gratuitement quelques cours de remise à niveau en mathématiques. 
Certes, l’idéal serait de changer radicalement le système éducatif
au Mexique, de se battre pour l’amélioration des écoles publiques et de faire
des campagnes contre le racisme, mais les petits ruisseaux font les grandes
rivières. Si Lupe et Maya dans quelques années parlent couramment anglais et
entrent à l’université, elles pourront alors défendre leur communauté. Si Lupe
et Maya s’avèrent être un exemple d’intégration réussie, d'autres personnes seront à l’évidence tentées de se lancer au Mexique dans un projet
similaire. 

LE BUDGET
Nous avons besoin pour payer les frais de scolarité et le matériel
de 3 600 euros par an, soit 1 800 euros par enfant. Vous trouverez la
répartition des frais ci-dessous. Les frais de scolarité seront immédiatement
payés à l’école pour bénéficier de 5% de remise supplémentaire et l’argent servant à payer matériel, livres et sorties, sera
déposé sur un compte en banque spécifique dont nous aurons seuls l’accès.  
Le père de Lupe et Maya, Ramon, s’est engagé à donner 400 pesos
par mois pour ses deux filles, l’équivalent de 25 euros. Il gagne 4500 pesos
par mois, a quatre enfants à nourrir et ne peut vraiment pas faire mieux. 
De notre côté, nous nous engageons à accompagner quotidiennement nos deux petites voisines, à leur donner des cours de soutien, à les encourager, mais aussi à vous donner de leurs nouvelles régulièrement: nous pensons publier une vidéo tous les six mois et peut-être créer prochainement un blog !
La collecte devra être renouvelée chaque année pendant encore 5
ans minimum jusqu’à leur entrée au collège. Si la somme de 3 600 euros est
dépassée, l’argent sera conservé sur le compte en banque pendant un an afin de
payer les frais de scolarité de l’année prochaine !

<p>We need $130,000 to open our franchise. This covers the franchise fee,
inventory and all start-up costs.</p>
<h3>Why do we want to open a Bricks and

<p>We
fell in love with this franchise the moment we walked into the Kailua, Hawaii
location. My husband, Jason, was fast approaching the end of his service contract in the Air
Force, and we instantly knew this was how we wanted to spend the rest of our
working years. We want to work side-by-side and put
smiles on people’s faces by providing excellent products, wonderful services
and a place for Lego enthusiasts of all ages to call home.

</p><h3>Why we're crowdfunding:</h3>
<p>We’ve saved $50,000 on our own, we’re debt free, have credit in the 800’s,
but the banks are still hesitant to loan us the $100,000 we need. For many, it’s
just too low a number. Some want to see it on the SBA approved franchise list
before they’ll act. Others insist we both have second jobs (after my husband's service contract
ends in April) before they’ll lend us the money. How they expect us to work
full time AND open a business is something I’ll never understand.</p>
<p>If we can crowdfund at least $50,000, we can secure a personal loan for the

<h3>About SORA COWORKING</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Shoka.  This is Yogni, my amazing partner.  We live in Cúcuta, Colombia and opened a very first coworking space in the city, SORA COWORKING, last year.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1626104090/kmzz7ny6x5gbpcpgfoqa.jpg"" src=""""/>   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1626104132/awt9qimod6ekbjvad32v.png"" src=""""/>   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1626104097/mwneviuvib5qslrswizl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Cúcuta is located in the northeast part of Colombia and situated on the border with Venezuela. Colombia has beautiful nature, fruits, people, culture and not to mention one of the best coffee in the world.</p>
<p>However, I have realized that there is not much space here in Cúcuta for people, both locals and internationals, to sit and work under safe and relaxing situation.  Houses or cafeterias are  wonderful places to work, but sometimes you can encounter various distractions or difficulties. That is why I decided to open a coworking space here.</p>
<p>Not only Sora Coworking is giving a positive impact to the locals (Colombians), but also to internationals. Since Cúcuta is close to Venezuela, and Venezulea has been struggling with economic, institutional, and social crisis for about 10 years and Cúcuta has been one of the main gates for them to enter. According to UNHCR, over 5 million Venezuelans have left the country, which is about 15% of its population. Due to this situation and for the pandemic as well, there are numerous NGOs/NPOs who are striving every single day to help people who are in need.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1626099040/ptmiiquff3qjpzs9ueqz.png"" src=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1626099049/mhmjbyj7zjix9k4h2yhl.png"" src=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1626099103/bl32kxpb1jzgtne2ifbg.png"" src=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1626099120/pr2rpsunlrozbxyontib.png"" src=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1626099206/ogs8yxxwm7qqf3yc0maa.jpg"" src=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1626099231/bl2nm4rgktoe35njpu8f.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The campaign is important to me and locals because we need space with fundamental materials, including safety, with relaxing environment in order for us to be innovative, creative and interactive.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We believe there are various impacts we can bring to Cúcuta and the world by this campaign.</p>
<p>First of all, we are offering space that is secure and relaxing to the locals who want to start new business, to organize an event, to have an presentation, to do networking, or even to study or relax. Majority of them need the space which they can feel comfortable and where they can afford, and Sora Coworking is one of the great option for them.</p>
<p>Second, Sora Coworking is inclusive. We are already receiving messages and calls from various parts of the country in different labor areas. This can make a positive impact for people to get chance and to grow collaboratively.</p>
<p>Our vision is that Sora Coworking is going to be an epicenter of entrepreneurship here in Cúcuta. We would like to open a gate in order for people to take the very first step to make an impact.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge that we face right now is with financial aspect, especially for the material and for the team.</p>
<p>We started our space last year with a small office, and moved here in March. We opened this new place recently, but our space is already being small. We can see there is a necessity clearly.</p>
<p>In order to Sora Coworking to be an epicenter, we need the place big enough, secure enough and comfortable enough for the people.  Security cameras, locks, tables, internet, air conditioner, lights, there are numerous material is needed. Also the place needs to be well-advertised. We can see the concept of ""coworking"" is still not well-known in the city, and people are curious about it. Our advertisement team is doing a great job, and hope to expand this opportunity to other web designers as well. </p>

Hi, I'm Shoka.  This is Yogni, my amazing partner.  We live in Cúcuta, Colombia and opened a very first coworking space in the city, SORA COWORKING, last year.
      
Cúcuta is located in the northeast part of Colombia and situated on the border with Venezuela. Colombia has beautiful nature, fruits, people, culture and not to mention one of the best coffee in the world.
However, I have realized that there is not much space here in Cúcuta for people, both locals and internationals, to sit and work under safe and relaxing situation.  Houses or cafeterias are  wonderful places to work, but sometimes you can encounter various distractions or difficulties. That is why I decided to open a coworking space here.
Not only Sora Coworking is giving a positive impact to the locals (Colombians), but also to internationals. Since Cúcuta is close to Venezuela, and Venezulea has been struggling with economic, institutional, and social crisis for about 10 years and Cúcuta has been one of the main gates for them to enter. According to UNHCR, over 5 million Venezuelans have left the country, which is about 15% of its population. Due to this situation and for the pandemic as well, there are numerous NGOs/NPOs who are striving every single day to help people who are in need.
     
The campaign is important to me and locals because we need space with fundamental materials, including safety, with relaxing environment in order for us to be innovative, creative and interactive.
 

What We Need
￥150,000(1,500USD) to cover the advertisement including the payment for web designers or system engineers.
   
￥300,000 (3,000USD) to cover the first 3 months rent and expenses.
￥350,000(3,500USD) to cover the tech, furniture, and decor. We are going to repair/reconstruct to make sure the place is secured.
　 　 
 

The Impact
We believe there are various impacts we can bring to Cúcuta and the world by this campaign.
First of all, we are offering space that is secure and relaxing to the locals who want to start new business, to organize an event, to have an presentation, to do networking, or even to study or relax. Majority of them need the space which they can feel comfortable and where they can afford, and Sora Coworking is one of the great option for them.
Second, Sora Coworking is inclusive. We are already receiving messages and calls from various parts of the country in different labor areas. This can make a positive impact for people to get chance and to grow collaboratively.
Our vision is that Sora Coworking is going to be an epicenter of entrepreneurship here in Cúcuta. We would like to open a gate in order for people to take the very first step to make an impact.
             
 

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge that we face right now is with financial aspect, especially for the material and for the team.
We started our space last year with a small office, and moved here in March. We opened this new place recently, but our space is already being small. We can see there is a necessity clearly.
In order to Sora Coworking to be an epicenter, we need the place big enough, secure enough and comfortable enough for the people.  Security cameras, locks, tables, internet, air conditioner, lights, there are numerous material is needed. Also the place needs to be well-advertised. We can see the concept of ""coworking"" is still not well-known in the city, and people are curious about it. Our advertisement team is doing a great job, and hope to expand this opportunity to other web designers as well.

<h3>Carl G Wargaming's Story</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm Steve White, and I am the Owner and General Manager of Carl G Wargaming Inc.  I have been playing board games, miniature wargames, role playing games, and collectible card games for a long.......long........time.  I've also been a professional painter of miniatures at different points in my life, like this one I did for a painting contest....</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1588625495/bziomjwx6u71jbnreih4.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I have been working for the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) since 1998 in a profession where I am able to build communities and care for the members and families in their most difficult times, and our nation's contribution to the war in Afghanistan meant that I was in high demand.  It all took its tole, and now I am preparing for a medical release due to the injuries I sustained in the service to my country. </p>
<p><i>(as a side note, I would have included some pictures of myself in uniform, but this would violate Section 291 of the National Defense Act (NDA), since a crowdfunder is seen as a commercial purpose).</i></p>
<p>My family and I took many months to decide what I would do after the military, and we kept coming back to my passion for community building and playing games.  Community building was why I joined the  CAF in the first place, and my passion for games has been with me my whole life, so we decided to start a game store back home in the Maritimes. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1588626122/ymxcxhd7xdw0khyhwxps.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We wanted to keep our connection to the military, so setting up our first store by CFB Gagetown seemed a natural choice.  There I will be building a community by setting up a game store that is in Oromocto itself, and which has the space to host large groups of game enthusiasts.  I know that games of all sorts are immensely popular to those associated with the military, and the ""recce"" we did in September 2019 found us the best location for it.</p>
<p>This will be a big step for my family, and the store will need strong support from the community to be a success, as well as being the game store you always wished for.  Even before COVID-19 hit, getting this business off the ground and well stocked with the games you want was going to be challenging, but now with the pandemic raging we need your help all the more.  The funds raised here will get us the shelving and game tables we need. (No-one likes having to play Settlers of Catan on the floor, or looking for product stacked in big heaps).  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1588629985/bzzafsvcat3lwh0bvm77.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>What Your Support Will Mean...</h3>
</div><div>
<p>It will mean the difference between having a store that is run by a caring newly retired military member, in a military town, and running event around the military time schedule.  This means planning our events and activities around the APS, Ex Maple Resolve, and large deployments.  It means providing a place for you to gather casually outside of the base.  It means building a strong game community in Oromocto with the expectation that this would follow with you to other military towns across Canada.  We are very happy to have our civilian customers as well, and in a way you will be supporting your troops by being a part of this community, and by supporting a business that is being started by a veteran.  Finally, it would mean the difference between this store succeeding or failing....its just that simple during this health crisis.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1588629883/xsikijwhjnanpmfojo3g.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Why open now....its a freekin' pandemic out there?</h3>
<p>When we signed our lease, hooked up the power and heat, and made other commitments in December 2019, expecting to open by the end of May,  we were just like every other Canadian at the time....just going along, business as usual.  The bad timing of this virus has left us with some hurdles to jump and is forcing us to be patient as we wait for contractors, banks, suppliers, and medical release moves to all start up again so we can get this place opened.  </p>
<h3>How much do you need and what do I get?</h3>
<p>We have set an initial goal of $10,000, but any we get over this means the more products, staff, and events we will be able to start up with right away.  It is set as a flexible goal, so if we don't make it to the goal, it will still help.  It just means that more is taken off the top by this crowdfunding platform if we do not achieve the goal.  This means that your dollar will go farther if we do meet and exceed the goal!</p>
<p>With respect to perks, I have tried to make them all interesting so that no matter what your get, it will be unique and memorable.  Whether this is being ordained as a priest of Cthulhu, getting a set of pretty dice (mmmmmm......more dice), or having a vote in what game lines we stock, we want you to start feeling like this is a game store made for <strong>YOU!</strong>  </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div>
<p>To be honest, this is a big risk for us (my family).  We are stepping away from everything I trained for and worked at for the last 20 years, right when my kids are finishing school and looking to college (tuition gives me nightmares already).  But we have done our homework, taken the courses, and found a community that wants what we are bringing to them.  We are ""all in"" and committed to making this a successful community-building business.  And the more successful this campaign is, the less risk of us stumbling as we do this ""about-turn-on-the-quick-march"" of my career.</p>

<h3>Mi Canasta Orgánica </h3>
<p>Mi Canasta Orgánica is a community farming project that aims to improve the lives of farming families by connecting the abundant production of organic produce in La Merced del Potrero with trade opportunities in the region. </p>
<p>Based on Oaxaca's coast, this project was born at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic as a means to address the growing economic difficulties in the region. A group of women from the mountain community of La Merced del Potrero came together, calling themselves ""Mi Canasta Orgánica"". These 16 women began collecting, transporting and trading organic produce on a weekly basis; providing an alternative source of organic products in the tourist destination of Bahías de Huatulco,</p>
<p>Currently, Mi Canasta Orgánica conducts sales by two means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Direct sales in four locations every Tuesday, led by the entrepreneurial “Las Señoras de Rosa"" (Ladies in Pink)</li>
<li>Home-delivery CSA-style baskets delivered directly to customers' door step </li>
</ul>
<p>Traditional, organic agriculture is the main economic activity of La Merced del Potrero, and it is facing increasing opposition from industrial agriculture.</p>
<p>In order to thrive, this initiative needs innovative, market-enabling tools such as online ordering, social media presence, and share the organic farming process with consumers. We seek to use this campaign to level the playing field, and include La Merced de Potrero as another actor in the local produce market. </p>

1. Generate new sales channels and strengthen those that already exist.This includes:


Improve conditions of the Tuesday points of sale to protect the sellers and customers from the elements.
Develop a ""next-week harvest"" inventory system to project the products available by season and generate a weekly pre-sales menu. 
Implement a social media strategy to raise awareness of the realities in farming communities, create transparency of the community's organic agricultural practices, and promote the different trade channels.

<span>AXIOM Beta is a brand new professional digital image capturing platform and you get access to it before anybody else does. So we want to make sure that you are aware of what you are getting yourself into. We're inviting you to be part of this journey as a contributor (you do not need to be a programmer to use the AXIOM Beta), helping to shape the final product. </span>

<p>apertus° was started by filmmakers who were fed up with the limitations of the tools they had to work with every day. Compared to 50 years ago, cameras today are technologically far superior, but at same time a lot less accessible. AXIOM Beta intends to fix that. Full and open documentation, the ability to add new features, change behavior of existing ones and to use any custom accessories are intended and plausible goal of AXIOM Beta.</p>
<br/><p>The plan is to democratize camera technology and put the power back into the hands of the users. It is a self liberation by creating high end tools that we ourselves love to work with - fully independent of any of the big established camera corporations. The time has never been better for such a revolution than it is today!</p>
<br/>By contributing to this project you enable the evolution of to a new stage of cameras, a whole new world of possibilities. Your ideas and experiences will help us advance AXIOM in the future. The crowd funding backers community will play an active role in deciding where the AXIOM development is heading.

<b><span>Upgrade Path:</span></b>
<p>Crowd funding backers will be offered an exclusive upgrade path to the production version of AXIOM. (probably called AXIOM Gamma) Essential components, like image sensors will be reusable as well.</p>
<p><b>Terms &amp; Conditions</b>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Crowd funding backers will receive AXIOM Beta at cost, payment is due at Ship. Current price values are gross estimates and depending on actual production volume might be a lot lower.</p>
<p>AXIOM Beta will also be made available as retail product once all crowd funding backers received their units, retail price will be significantly higher (not at cost) to support a sustainable open hardware business model.</p>
<p>You will get an official invoice from us when we received your AXIOM Beta payment.</p>
<p>AXIOM Beta has standard EU limited warranty against manufacturing defects.</p>
<p>If your camera gets damaged outside the warranty coverage we will offer fairly priced replacement parts for purchase.</p>
<p>Each € 500 development donation entitles you to one AXIOM Beta unit only.</p>
<p>AXIOM Beta will be delivered as assembled &amp; tested or unassembled (with individual components tested) development kit without CE/FCC certification.</p>
<p>Local taxes (VAT), custom fees or duties may apply when receiving your AXIOM Beta. </p>
<p>For certain countries export regulations regarding specific electronic components might apply.<br/></p>
<p>

</p>
<p>All software that we create in the course of AXIOM Beta development will be released under the GNU GPL V2 and all hardware under CERN OHL V1.2.<br/></p>
<p>The Open Source revolution was initially started by technicians and programmers but we are witnessing that we are already in the middle of the next phase where artists and creative people join in. This is key to Open Source’s global acceptance.</p>
<br/><p><b>Fairness is what we believe</b> Open Source ethics basically boils down to. This goes hand in hand with caring about the environment when we plan production or pick the raw materials.</p>
<p><b>Upgrade Instead of Replace</b> is a key motto for all our designs and naturally leads to modularity and more flexible devices, as their longevity is already ensured at the design stage.</p>
<b>Fair Working Conditions</b> for our employees are important to us. So we decided to not go where the labour cost is the lowest but instead do as much as we can in-house or at partner companies we trust to follow the same ethics standards as we do.

<p><span>The largest part of the raised money will go directly into development of the AXIOM Beta (salaries, tools, hardware, prototyping, services, etc.) Another large part will be infrastructure, creating workspace for camera testing/assembly.</span>
</p>
<p>We will maintain a limited reserve fund both as a safety net to ensure production of your AXIOM Beta and as a financial buffer so we can start production of the ordered units before all full payments have arrived. This will reduce rollout time significantly. Another reserve will be created to cover warranty and returns.</p>

<h3>Is an external recording device required for the AXIOM Beta?</h3>
<p>That very much depends on what you want to do with your device and the resulting amount of data per second. For recording low bandwidth data (i.e. high resolution at low framerate or low resolution at high framerate) an external recording device is not required. You can store the data on microSD or transfer it to a device connected through Ethernet, USB or even WiFi. For high resolution and high framerate you will need a suitable recorder connected via a high speed interface like HDMI, SDI or similar.
            <br/></p>
<h3>Why are you giving away the AXIOM Beta so much under retail price? What is the catch?</h3>
<p>With the AXIOM Beta we do not seek to just find customers that purchase cameras. We want to lay the foundation for an active community that is ready to participate in defining and shaping where the AXIOM development is going and that is able to work with pre-production hardware and test new features as they arrive providing valuable feedback and contributions to the apertus° development team and community. That’s why we give the hardware away to those people at cost.</p>
<h3>Are AXIOM cameras going to be available as unassembled DIY kits only?</h3>
<p>No, the AXIOM beta will come assembled and fully operational straight out-of-the-box. For people who are interested in receiving their camera unassembled and in separate parts (so as to make modifications and/or re-arrange them in a non-standard manner), there will be the possibility to do so, however we are not expecting this to be the norm.</p>
<h3>Do I need to be a programmer to use the AXIOM Beta?</h3>
<p>Not at all, software which doesn't require any programming skills will be developed on and for the AXIOM Beta, so all you need to do is to wait a litte till it is useable. During the early stages it won't hurt to have some skills or at least the willingness to learn from and contribute to the software development.</p>
<h3>Do I need to be a programmer to use any future AXIOM?</h3>No, absolutely not! It is of great importance to us that you - the end users - are able to access the source code and the blueprints for our designs. Whilst everything is open hardware / free software, this does not mean that you are required to study our code and implement changes. If you simply wish to use the AXIOM for film making purposes, it will operate in a manner similar to any other camera you might have used before. There may come a day, however, when you want your camera to function in a manner beyond what it was initially intended to do. In these scenarios, it's great to be able to access the source files (required for modification) and re-program the hardware as you see fit.


        <h3>What dynamic range can I expect?</h3>
<p>The CMV12000 sensor provides 10 stops out of the box. Various tricks can be used to increase the dynamic range up to 15 stops. We are confident to have at least 12 stops of dynamic range without impacting the image's quality.</p>
<p>The Truesense (Kodak) has 12 F-stops (Rolling Shutter) and 9.3 F-stops (Global Shutter)</p>
<p>
            The CMV12000 sensor supports three different High Dynamic Range (HDR) modes.
          
        </p>
<ul>
<li>One mode alters the sensors photo-site response curve from a linear default behavior to a shape that is closer to a logarithmic response. This happens before the ADC so no digital data is sacrificed for the additional dynamic range.</li>
<li>The second mode uses different exposure times for even and odd pixel columns. So two exposure brackets can be captured at the same time for sacrificing horizontal resolution.</li>
<li>The third mode is possible due to the high speed nature of the sensor allowing alternating exposure times with each recorded frame and doubling/tripling/etc. frame rate result in double/triple/etc. the amount of data to be captured.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can decide later if you would like to buy the camera for the exclusive crowd- funding perk offer or not. There will be a specific point in time though when we will contact all perk holders as only with a high production volume we will be able to reduce the manufacturing cost for everyone.</p>
<h3>Does the AXIOM Beta include a video recorder?</h3>
<p>No, the AXIOM Beta has no built in recorder, but will provide several options and add-ons to allow recording. Currently we advise to use any existing HDMI recorder. We will work closely with manufacturer to provide “out of the box” compatibility from the popular recorders.</p>
<p>This being said, the camera includes multiple micro-SD ports, so you WILL be able to record 4K RAW still images out of the box. The micro SD card just doesn’t allow motion picture recording.</p>

As seen on:
If the crowd-funding campaign reaches at least the following amounts we will be able to develop the following items:
€110,000 - AXIOM Beta Remote Control with Real Buttons and Knobs
AXIOM Beta Remote Control concept rendering
We will develop an AXIOM Beta wired remote control device complete 
with LCD, buttons, knobs and dials (no live video monitoring). A 
wireless design might be possible, but needs more testing.
Estimated retail price of the Remote Control will be around €300 (gross estimate)€120,000 - Active Canon EF Mount
We will develop an AXIOM Beta EF lens mount module with electronic 
lens control. This will allow setting aperture and focus (with the 
Remote Control or from a smartphone/tablet) with most Canon EF lenses 
when attached to the AXIOM Beta.Canon EF Mount retail price will be around €300 (gross estimate)€130,000 - AXIOM Beta Active Battery Mount

AXIOM Beta with battery (concept image - work in progress)
We will develop a battery mount for NP-F970/F750/F550 batteries to 
power the AXIOM Beta. Includes power usage and capacity monitoring to 
estimate remaining charge and time remaining.€150,000 - AXIOM Beta 4K RAW PC recording optionWe will research and develop a method to stream and record real time 4K RAW video from the AXIOM Beta to a PC. The goal is to design an affordable interface card solution that will be available in Q2 2015.









AXIOM Beta is a brand new professional digital image capturing platform and you get access to it before anybody else does. So we want to make sure that you are aware of what you are getting yourself into. We're inviting you to be part of this journey as a contributor (you do not need to be a programmer to use the AXIOM Beta), helping to shape the final product. 


apertus° was started by filmmakers who were fed up with the limitations of the tools they had to work with every day. Compared to 50 years ago, cameras today are technologically far superior, but at same time a lot less accessible. AXIOM Beta intends to fix that. Full and open documentation, the ability to add new features, change behavior of existing ones and to use any custom accessories are intended and plausible goal of AXIOM Beta.
The plan is to democratize camera technology and put the power back into the hands of the users. It is a self liberation by creating high end tools that we ourselves love to work with - fully independent of any of the big established camera corporations. The time has never been better for such a revolution than it is today!
By contributing to this project you enable the evolution of to a new stage of cameras, a whole new world of possibilities. Your ideas and experiences will help us advance AXIOM in the future. The crowd funding backers community will play an active role in deciding where the AXIOM development is heading.

 We created a proof-of-concept
 prototype to get a feel what moving images from the 4K global shutter 
image sensor are like.  This is the AXIOM Alpha, which we sometimes call
 “the shoebox prototype”:Even at this early stage, the fully rigged AXIOM Alpha was surprisingly nice to handle even for handheld shooting.

Please note that these are the specs of the image sensor not the AXIOM Beta, we will try our best to utilize as much performance as possible from each sensor.

We set out on a journey to create a documentary film to learn how Hollywood reacts to new and open technology. Truth is: Open Source has already arrived there, and people are curious yet critical of this new quality.










To continue the “Hollywood loves Open Source” documentary film we will follow the story of how the AXIOM Beta progresses and how Hollywood will react to it with additional interviews and insights.






Upgrade Path:
Crowd funding backers will be offered an exclusive upgrade path to the production version of AXIOM. (probably called AXIOM Gamma) Essential components, like image sensors will be reusable as well.
Terms & Conditions


Crowd funding backers will receive AXIOM Beta at cost, payment is due at Ship. Current price values are gross estimates and depending on actual production volume might be a lot lower.
AXIOM Beta will also be made available as retail product once all crowd funding backers received their units, retail price will be significantly higher (not at cost) to support a sustainable open hardware business model.
You will get an official invoice from us when we received your AXIOM Beta payment.
AXIOM Beta has standard EU limited warranty against manufacturing defects.
If your camera gets damaged outside the warranty coverage we will offer fairly priced replacement parts for purchase.
Each € 500 development donation entitles you to one AXIOM Beta unit only.
AXIOM Beta will be delivered as assembled & tested or unassembled (with individual components tested) development kit without CE/FCC certification.
Local taxes (VAT), custom fees or duties may apply when receiving your AXIOM Beta. 
For certain countries export regulations regarding specific electronic components might apply.




All software that we create in the course of AXIOM Beta development will be released under the GNU GPL V2 and all hardware under CERN OHL V1.2.
The Open Source revolution was initially started by technicians and programmers but we are witnessing that we are already in the middle of the next phase where artists and creative people join in. This is key to Open Source’s global acceptance.
Fairness is what we believe Open Source ethics basically boils down to. This goes hand in hand with caring about the environment when we plan production or pick the raw materials.
Upgrade Instead of Replace is a key motto for all our designs and naturally leads to modularity and more flexible devices, as their longevity is already ensured at the design stage.
Fair Working Conditions for our employees are important to us. So we decided to not go where the labour cost is the lowest but instead do as much as we can in-house or at partner companies we trust to follow the same ethics standards as we do.

The largest part of the raised money will go directly into development of the AXIOM Beta (salaries, tools, hardware, prototyping, services, etc.) Another large part will be infrastructure, creating workspace for camera testing/assembly.

We will maintain a limited reserve fund both as a safety net to ensure production of your AXIOM Beta and as a financial buffer so we can start production of the ordered units before all full payments have arrived. This will reduce rollout time significantly. Another reserve will be created to cover warranty and returns.



We are in this boat together. We already built the AXIOM Alpha prototype successfully, and are very eager to bring you the AXIOM Beta. It is always a possibility that we might suffer from delays, caused by electronic component shortages or shipping delays as well as having to do additional revisions for parts to ensure optimal quality.


In every case we are committed to full transparency about the process and the achieved progress. We will share with our backers and community the things that require additional attention or caused delays just as much as we’ll report about success and finished components.

<p><strong>We're hoping to raise $75k</strong>, which will go towards:<strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><a href=""https://www.irsss.ca/home"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Indian Residential School Survivors Society</a> | <a href=""https://www.kidsafe.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">KidSafe Project Society</a> | <a href=""https://gwfoodconnection.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Grandview Woodland Food Connection</a> | <a href=""http://eastsidefamilyplace.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Eastside Family Place</a>. </strong>A portion of your pledge will be donated to one of these amazing organizations, the higher the pledge, the bigger the donation and you get to choose where those dollars go. Click the links above to do a deeper dive on each organization, so that you can learn about the amazing things they're doing for our community and make an informed choice about where you'd like us to direct donations. Seb's will also continue to support these organizations in the long term.</li>
<li>
<b>Lease deposits &amp; utility startup costs</b>, once we find the perfect spot! Rest assured that<strong> Seb's will be on The Drive</strong> and we won't be settling for any other neighbourhood. This isn't to say that there aren't other fabulous 'hoods in the city, it's simply that The Drive is home to Seb &amp; Susan, it's the neighbourhood that we live in, belong to, feel safe in and know how to serve best.</li>
<li>
<strong>Design. Build out. Equipment. Fixtures &amp; fittings.</strong> We'll be hiring local, inclusion-informed designers &amp; consultants, East Van trades people and as much as possible, purchasing materials &amp; equipment locally.</li>
<li>
<strong>Toys, games &amp; other fun stuff to keep the kids happy! </strong>Imagine a place where your kids feel at home and welcome to be themselves while they play foosball, LEGO or chess (and maybe even some wicked fun arcade games!), or curl up in a quiet corner with a book, all <strong>while you sit back with a local beer</strong> and something delicious to eat.</li>
<li>
<strong>Inventory. </strong>We're going to need to stock our retail shelves high &amp; create kick ass food &amp; beverage programs. <strong>As always, everything Seb's serves &amp; sells will be either made in East Van </strong>or will come from an East Van based company.</li>
<li>
<b>Hiring &amp; inclusivity consultants. </b>We want to support our community through employment and intend to pay our staff exceedingly well. We also intend to be an inclusive workplace and will be consulting with local organizations on how to best support our neurodiverse neighbours into well-paid, meaningful jobs at Seb's.</li>
<li>
<strong>Community outreach</strong>. Every single dollar that goes into Seb's will be staying in our community and a lot of those dollars will go into our community outreach programs, through direct sponsorships, meal programs, educational workshops, community art initiatives...the possibilities are endless!</li>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Back us &amp; you're backing them, too!</strong></h2>
<p><strong>         </strong> The East Van small business circle of support is so very strong and has the potential for exponential growth...everything you buy from Seb's, we bought from our East Van vendors first and you know what? Our vendors like to support local, too! More often than not they're using local suppliers for the ingredients, packaging &amp; tools that go into creating your favourite products AND they employ local people! If you really think about it, the delicious Jamaican patties that you bought from Seb's and had for dinner last night are yes, the product of Chris's hard work, love and dedication but they also represent dollars spent in multiple local supply chains and the livelihoods of so many of our neighbours.</p>
<p>   The bigger Seb's gets, the more dollars we spend in our community! The Seb's East Van Vendor list is already 20+ strong and we're bringing in new local talent every week!

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>We're very aware that we're entering a world with many risks &amp; hurdles to overcome and these are the reasons that we believe that we'll be able to stand proud and unflinching in the face of any challenge that comes our way:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>You.</strong> Seb and Susan have been through a world of shit together over the past few years and through it all, our community has been there to back us up, cheer us on and lift us up whenever we've needed it. It's <strong>the knowledge that you are behind us</strong> that makes it possible to even have this dream and it's the main motivator behind the drive to make it a success.</li>
<li>
<strong>Seb. </strong>We're building this business to serve our community but the really big picture for Susan is that it's building a future for her son. Seb’s  is a family business in the strongest sense of the term. Not only is it a place where Seb himself will be provided with opportunities for learning, employment and perhaps one day ownership but it's also a vehicle for <strong>building a family of community around him</strong>, so that he always knows that he belongs and is safe right where he is and that the people around him know him and love him.</li>
<li>
<strong>Susan. </strong>If you haven't met me (just gonna write in first person for this bit!), you might not know how single-minded I can be when I have a goal to work towards. This has been a lifelong trait of mine that has seen me through two transatlantic moves, a self-funded university degree, starting two businesses and now, finding ways to support my little family alone. I spent over a decade working in every iteration of the hospitality industry, from cooking, serving, bartending &amp; nightclub coat check girl, to supervisory &amp; management roles and most recently food production and retail. I pride myself on my resourcefulness...if it needs doing, I will undeniably find a way.</li>
<li>If we don't reach our full Indiegogo goal (we know, it's a lofty one!), we'll barrel ahead regardless. Seb &amp; Susan have put time, heart, soul and their own cash into this business and <strong>giving up is not an option! </strong>The funds that are raised here should be enough to get our foot in the door, after which time we would be able to go to the bank to seek debt funding and we're also very open to partnering up with investors.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What do we mean by sensory-sensitive?</h2>
<p>When you come into Seb’s, you’ll likely notice that things feel a little different from your typical café environment.

It's time for Seb's to take the leap
from online to real life and we're
beyond thrilled to invite you
to join the party!
 
 
            

Seb & Susan


Seb's is a mom & son operation based in East Vancouver, with the goal of opening a family-friendly, community-driven, sensory-sensitive, all-inclusive café & retail space in our Commercial Drive neighbourhood. 

We've been delivering made-in-East Van goods all over Greater Vancouver since December 2020, always with the view of providing a storefront for our local vendors and a menu chock full of the deliciousness that our wickedly talented local food entrepreneurs are already cooking up, right here in our 'hood!

Seb's exists specifically to serve our neighbours, whether that be through the warm & welcoming hospitality that will be extended to our guests, or the community outreach that's built into our budget and we're so excited to invite you to jump in with us now, so we can all build this dream together.

 


Where will your dollars go?
We're hoping to raise $75k, which will go towards: 


Indian Residential School Survivors Society | KidSafe Project Society | Grandview Woodland Food Connection | Eastside Family Place. A portion of your pledge will be donated to one of these amazing organizations, the higher the pledge, the bigger the donation and you get to choose where those dollars go. Click the links above to do a deeper dive on each organization, so that you can learn about the amazing things they're doing for our community and make an informed choice about where you'd like us to direct donations. Seb's will also continue to support these organizations in the long term.

Lease deposits & utility startup costs, once we find the perfect spot! Rest assured that Seb's will be on The Drive and we won't be settling for any other neighbourhood. This isn't to say that there aren't other fabulous 'hoods in the city, it's simply that The Drive is home to Seb & Susan, it's the neighbourhood that we live in, belong to, feel safe in and know how to serve best.

Design. Build out. Equipment. Fixtures & fittings. We'll be hiring local, inclusion-informed designers & consultants, East Van trades people and as much as possible, purchasing materials & equipment locally.

Toys, games & other fun stuff to keep the kids happy! Imagine a place where your kids feel at home and welcome to be themselves while they play foosball, LEGO or chess (and maybe even some wicked fun arcade games!), or curl up in a quiet corner with a book, all while you sit back with a local beer and something delicious to eat.

Inventory. We're going to need to stock our retail shelves high & create kick ass food & beverage programs. As always, everything Seb's serves & sells will be either made in East Van or will come from an East Van based company.

Hiring & inclusivity consultants. We want to support our community through employment and intend to pay our staff exceedingly well. We also intend to be an inclusive workplace and will be consulting with local organizations on how to best support our neurodiverse neighbours into well-paid, meaningful jobs at Seb's.

Community outreach. Every single dollar that goes into Seb's will be staying in our community and a lot of those dollars will go into our community outreach programs, through direct sponsorships, meal programs, educational workshops, community art initiatives...the possibilities are endless!

 


Club Seb
This is the pledge perk that we're most excited about and it's included at every tier!
Club Seb is a concept born of the desire to try to find a way to mitigate some of the risks that come along with operating a hospitality business on the super tight margins that the industry is so well known for.
As a member, you can sign up for a monthly subscription, which affords you a monthly store credit of $5-$20, free tea or coffee every time you come in, exclusive updates & voting power and a place on our in-store wall of fame, which includes a family mini session with a local photographer and a take-home print! Depending on what tier you go for, your pledge today will get you either a lifetime or one year membership to Club Seb!

We have been friends since high school and, after graduating at university, we decided to <strong>create a project</strong> for the <strong>sustainable development</strong> of our territory. </p><p><strong>Niccolò</strong> studied International Political Science and is keen about travel, also thanks to the Erasmus+ experience. He has always been involved in his community through participation in volunteering events of local cooperatives, like the “Morvillo” presidium of Libera. Moreover, he has developed digital skills in how to manage social media, web design and an e-commerce.</p><p><strong>Lorenzo</strong> has been living in the Cinque Terre his whole life and knows quite well both the culture and the problems of his territory. He graduated in Tourism and Territory Development and has an active role in the Cinque Terre National Park, being president of the Youth Council. </p><p><strong>Gianpaolo</strong> has lived in the Cinque Terre all his life as well and has always been committed in the support of his territory. He loves to think of himself as the keeper of ancient rural and marine traditions, passed down from generation to generation.</p><p>Such strong sense of place motivated us to protect and <strong>restore </strong>our territory. We want to make sure that <strong>future generations </strong>will be able to learn from the same traditions and enjoy the beauty of the <strong>Cinque Terre National Park</strong>. </p><p>It was such dedication to our land that inspired us to create a <strong>2.0 Agricultural Company</strong> within the <strong>Cinque Terre National Park</strong>. The main aim is to <strong>preserve our territory</strong> and protect it from <strong>neglect and abandonment</strong>. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619810744/g5yfshcyvl9wgyzzfqoj.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><br/><strong><i><i>From left: Lorenzo, Gianpaolo &amp; Niccolò</i><br/><br/><br/>The story of our project:</i></strong></p><p>Like we said before, we have been living here in the <strong>Cinque Terre</strong> forever, and we are well aware that our territory is as <strong>beautiful as fragile</strong>. Over the last decades, the people have stopped <strong>taking care</strong> of the peculiar balance between human settlement and Nature, that here in the <strong>Cinque Terre </strong>is as <strong>unique as precarious. </strong></p><p>Without any doubt, the greatest danger threatening the<strong> Cinque Terre territory</strong> is the <strong>hydrogeological instability</strong>, caused by the <strong>abandonment of the land and</strong> the lack of adequate <strong>maintenance. </strong></p><p>Every year, the<strong> risk of flooding</strong> is very high. Everyone in the Cinque Terre will remember forever the immense <strong>damage and pain</strong> caused by <strong>the flood</strong> of the <strong><i>25th of November 2011.  </i></strong></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619789095/e2u2qc1pfgdr3vqejgwc.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Fortunately, nothing similar has happened since, but every winter with heavy rainfall there is always a great many damage. In these occasions, the <strong>dry-stone walls</strong>, a symbol of the Cinque Terre, usually collapse, <strong>the streets are damaged</strong>, the territory stability is constantly threatened by landslides, causing great danger and problems to <strong>inhabitants and visitors</strong>. </p><p>We also want to highlight that the <strong>mass tourism does not benefit</strong> such a fragile territory. Every year the <strong>Cinque Terre host over 4 million visitors</strong>, without following a proper plan to manage this tourism flux. In addition, such a plan should be drawn up in view of the <strong>environmental protection</strong>, and not only of the profits. </p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>Our project:</i></strong></p><p>The idea of <strong>WILD FARM CURNIGIA </strong>was born from a desire to deal with the damage caused from both the abandonment of the land and the mass tourism. </p><p>WILD FARM CURNIGIA will be a <strong>2.0 Agricultural Company</strong>, with a negative environmental impact (below zero). The farm will be on a land that is now <strong>abandoned and neglected</strong>, but that we are going to <strong>restore</strong>. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619793664/loqdcbchfnms4ylm4rmz.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>We will therefore offer a new <strong>type of visit</strong>, during which everyone could be able to <strong>discover</strong> the very <strong>core of Cinque Terre</strong>: a difficult yet stunning territory, its harsh but <strong>authentic people</strong>, the <strong>traditions</strong> and the <strong>typical products</strong>. </p><p>Not only will our project be committed to restore <strong>abandoned territories</strong> and plant typical products, but it will also offer a series of <strong>new tourism services</strong>. Our offers will be conceived in terms of <i><strong>slow tourism</strong></i>, so that the visitors will have time to notice the frail beauty of our territory and to embrace the same cause of its inhabitants, choosing to value, <strong>respect and defend it.</strong> <br/> </p><p>Moreover, our <strong>Wild Farm aims </strong>to start or take part to some social initiatives, as we firmly believe that <strong><i>economic growth goes hand in hand with social development. </i></strong></p><p>On one hand, we will promote <strong>young people</strong>, <strong>refugees </strong>and <strong>immigrants’ integration</strong> into the labor market, in support of the institutions’ <strong>campaigns of inclusiveness</strong>.

What we want is to protect the biodiversity and, at the same time, to help the proliferation of bees and beehives. We also created a garden of herbs, largely used in the local cuisine. </p><p>Apart from our work in <strong>Corniglia</strong>, we recently obtained a beautiful olive grove, located near the Santuario di <strong>Nostra Signora di Reggio, </strong>above Vernazza. <strong>Our farm</strong> will now be able to develop a project of <strong>olive cultivation and oil production,</strong> that will certainly be as interesting as challenging.</p><p><strong>But now we need your help to pursue the dream of Wild Farm Curnigia.</strong></p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>What we want to do:</i></strong></p><p>Through this Crowd Funding campaign, we will be able to actually start our <strong>Wild Farm Curnigia</strong>. </p><p>In particular, our project is made up of two parts: </p><p><i><strong>Wild Farm Curnigia area. </strong></i></p><p>Thanks to your donation, a <strong>visiting area</strong> will be created in our lands, that are easily accessible by the <strong>railway station in Corniglia</strong>.

Ho inoltre sviluppato competenze digitali nell’ambito dei social media, web design ed e-commerce.</p><p>Io, <strong>Lorenzo</strong>, vivo da sempre nelle Cinque Terre, e conosco profondamente la cultura e i problemi di questo territorio. Ho completato il percorso di studi in Turismo e Sviluppo del Territorio; sono inoltre impegnato in ambito sociale e politico all’interno del Parco Nazionale delle Cinque Terre, ricoprendo il ruolo di Presidente della Consulta dei Giovani.</p><p>Io, <strong>Gianpaolo</strong>, da sempre vivo nelle Cinque Terre e da sempre sono impegnato, anche dal punto di vista lavorativo, in questo territorio. Amo considerarmi come un custode delle antiche tradizioni rurali e marinare della mia terra che, dalle generazioni che ci hanno preceduto, vengono tramandate a noi giovani.<br/><br/>Da questo forte sentimento di appartenenza ai nostri luoghi, prende forma l’idea di salvaguardare e ripristinare il territorio, per far sì che anche le generazioni future possano trarne i valori, gli insegnamenti, e possano anche goderne la bellezza, elementi che contraddistinguono il <strong>Parco Nazionale delle Cinque Terre</strong>, rendendolo unico nel mondo. </p><p>Dalla passione e dall’attenzione per la nostra terra, quindi, è nata l'idea di creare un'<strong>Azienda Agricola 2.0</strong> all’interno del territorio del Parco Nazionale delle Cinque Terre, con l’obbiettivo principale di portare un importante contributo alla sua <strong>tutela</strong> ed alla <strong>salvaguardia</strong> rispetto ai danni derivanti dall’incuria e dall’abbandono. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img

insita nella loro particolare bellezza, esiste una estrema fragilità.<br/>Le <strong>Cinque Terre</strong>, infatti, sono piccole e fragili, ed in venir meno, nel corso degli ultimi decenni, della paziente, lenta e costante opera dell’uomo porta a far crollare quel peculiare equilibrio tra insediamento umano e Natura, che in questi luoghi ha raggiunto caratteristiche uniche, di una <strong>instabile e precaria perfezione.</strong></p><p>Il principale e maggiore <strong>pericolo</strong> che incombe sul territorio delle Cinque Terre è sicuramente rappresentato dal <strong>dissesto idrogeologico</strong>, causato dall'<strong>abbandono dei terreni </strong>e dalla mancanza di <strong>adeguata manutenzione</strong>.</p><p>Ogni anno il rischio di un'<strong>alluvione</strong> è sempre altissimo; resteranno per sempre indelebili nella memoria degli abitanti delle Cinque Terre, gli immensi danni e il dolore causati dalla famosa alluvione del <strong>25 Novembre 2011.</strong><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619789267/emthlep6rtbnmvv8qord.jpg""

danni; frequentemente franano i <strong>muretti a secco</strong>, che delle Cinque Terre sono il simbolo e la colonna vertebrale, si lesionano le strade di accesso, e l'integrità del territorio viene costantemente <strong>minacciata da uno stillicidio di frane</strong>, con grave<strong> pericolo </strong>ed enormi disagi per la popolazione residente e per i visitatori. </p><p>Vogliamo sottolineare, inoltre, che un<strong> territorio</strong> così <strong>fragile</strong> come il nostro, non trova certo un aiuto da un tipo dal <strong>turismo sregolato e di massa</strong>, che ogni anno conduce nelle Cinque Terre oltre <strong>4 milioni di visitatori</strong>, senza però un sistema che consenta la corretta gestione di tale flusso turistico, in un’ottica che non sia solo di profitto a corto respiro, ma che, invece, sia anche orientata alla <strong>salvaguardia ambientale.</strong> </p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>IL NOSTRO PROGETTO: </strong></i></p><p><strong>L’idea di WILD FARM CÜRNIGIA nasce proprio per combattere e trovare rimedio ai danni causati, da un lato dall’abbandono delle terre, e dall’altro, dal turismo di massa. </strong></p><p>WILD FARM CÜRNIGIA, nelle nostre intenzioni, sarà un'<strong>Azienda Agricola 2.0</strong> con un<i><strong> i<strong>mp</strong>atto ambientale negativo </strong></i>(inferiore

e splendido, della gente, aspra ma genuina, delle tradizioni e dei prodotti tipici, e tutto questo in una <strong>chiave Slow</strong>. </p><p>Il progetto della nostra Azienda Agricola non si ferma solo al <strong>recupero e ripristino dei terreni</strong> <strong>abbandonati</strong> e del ritorno alla <strong>produzione agricola </strong>dei prodotti locali tipici, ma vuole anche offrire una serie di servizi turistici, pensati ed organizzati in <strong>chiave Slow</strong>, così da portare i visitatori a comprendere l’effimera e fragile bellezza del territorio, ed a condividere, insieme alle popolazioni locali, la scelta di <strong>valorizzarlo, rispettarlo e difenderlo.</strong> <br/> </p><p><img class=""lazy""

We have been friends since high school and, after graduating at university, we decided to create a project for the sustainable development of our territory. Niccolò studied International Political Science and is keen about travel, also thanks to the Erasmus+ experience. He has always been involved in his community through participation in volunteering events of local cooperatives, like the “Morvillo” presidium of Libera. Moreover, he has developed digital skills in how to manage social media, web design and an e-commerce.Lorenzo has been living in the Cinque Terre his whole life and knows quite well both the culture and the problems of his territory. He graduated in Tourism and Territory Development and has an active role in the Cinque Terre National Park, being president of the Youth Council. Gianpaolo has lived in the Cinque Terre all his life as well and has always been committed in the support of his territory. He loves to think of himself as the keeper of ancient rural and marine traditions, passed down from generation to generation.Such strong sense of place motivated us to protect and restore our territory. We want to make sure that future generations will be able to learn from the same traditions and enjoy the beauty of the Cinque Terre National Park. It was such dedication to our land that inspired us to create a 2.0 Agricultural Company within the Cinque Terre National Park. The main aim is to preserve our territory and protect it from neglect and abandonment. From left: Lorenzo, Gianpaolo & NiccolòThe story of our project:Like we said before, we have been living here in the Cinque Terre forever, and we are well aware that our territory is as beautiful as fragile. Over the last decades, the people have stopped taking care of the peculiar balance between human settlement and Nature, that here in the Cinque Terre is as unique as precarious. Without any doubt, the greatest danger threatening the Cinque Terre territory is the hydrogeological instability, caused by the abandonment of the land and the lack of adequate maintenance. Every year, the risk of flooding is very high. Everyone in the Cinque Terre will remember forever the immense damage and pain caused by the flood of the 25th of November 2011.    Fortunately, nothing similar has happened since, but every winter with heavy rainfall there is always a great many damage. In these occasions, the dry-stone walls, a symbol of the Cinque Terre, usually collapse, the streets are damaged, the territory stability is constantly threatened by landslides, causing great danger and problems to inhabitants and visitors. We also want to highlight that the mass tourism does not benefit such a fragile territory. Every year the Cinque Terre host over 4 million visitors, without following a proper plan to manage this tourism flux. In addition, such a plan should be drawn up in view of the environmental protection, and not only of the profits.  Our project:The idea of WILD FARM CURNIGIA was born from a desire to deal with the damage caused from both the abandonment of the land and the mass tourism. WILD FARM CURNIGIA will be a 2.0 Agricultural Company, with a negative environmental impact (below zero). The farm will be on a land that is now abandoned and neglected, but that we are going to restore. We will therefore offer a new type of visit, during which everyone could be able to discover the very core of Cinque Terre: a difficult yet stunning territory, its harsh but authentic people, the traditions and the typical products. Not only will our project be committed to restore abandoned territories and plant typical products, but it will also offer a series of new tourism services. Our offers will be conceived in terms of slow tourism, so that the visitors will have time to notice the frail beauty of our territory and to embrace the same cause of its inhabitants, choosing to value, respect and defend it.  Moreover, our Wild Farm aims to start or take part to some social initiatives, as we firmly believe that economic growth goes hand in hand with social development. On one hand, we will promote young people, refugees and immigrants’ integration into the labor market, in support of the institutions’ campaigns of inclusiveness. On the other hand, we will create activities and workshops, in collaboration with local institutions and schools, in order to get the children to re-discover their territories. What we did:We have already started to work hard for our dream to protect the Cinque Terre territory. After a few months, some interesting results are starting to show. First, we got over 1000 square meters of lands: the famous yet long abandoned Cinque Terre terraces, near the town of Corniglia. The lands have been deforested, restored and are now ready to be farmed.In order to make the terraces accessible and to guarantee the safety of our work and territory, we re-built several cubic meters of stone-dry walls, digging up and rearranging the stones of the old walls. Our Wild Farm Area before and afterHere, we found the traces of an old hen house, that we decided to rebuild, make bigger and more comfortable for our hens, that are guarded by Tito the rooster and well protected from foxes and weasels’ night incursions.Our feathered friends will soon welcome a duck and a goose, that are still cared for in our nursery. Furthermore, as we restore the terraces, we are planting a great many species of plants and flowers. What we want is to protect the biodiversity and, at the same time, to help the proliferation of bees and beehives. We also created a garden of herbs, largely used in the local cuisine. Apart from our work in Corniglia, we recently obtained a beautiful olive grove, located near the Santuario di Nostra Signora di Reggio, above Vernazza. Our farm will now be able to develop a project of olive cultivation and oil production, that will certainly be as interesting as challenging.But now we need your help to pursue the dream of Wild Farm Curnigia. What we want to do:Through this Crowd Funding campaign, we will be able to actually start our Wild Farm Curnigia. In particular, our project is made up of two parts: Wild Farm Curnigia area. Thanks to your donation, a visiting area will be created in our lands, that are easily accessible by the railway station in Corniglia. On the hill right above the station, we will set up a unique sensory path, enriched by the telling about the life and needs of the Cinque Terre territory.The path will include:- a barefoot path, to directly “feel” the Cinque Terre- the herbs garden, to explore the biodiversity and the beauty of nature, mainly using the senses of smell, sight and touch.- listening cones, to quietly experience our land, separately from the rest of the world. - a path between the lemon trees, to discover the taste, smell and beauty of our lemons and compare them with our other products.As we mentioned before, we have already realized the herbs garden and the hen house. Therefore, we will use part of the donations to implement the other activities (the barefoot path, the one between the lemon trees, the listening cones) and to equip all paths with railings and fences, to protect the safety of our visitors. Furthermore, in order to have the lowest possible environmental impact, we will use the other part of your donations to plant about 30 fruit trees and more than 100 flower plants in our lands.The olive grove:The olive grove will be the final destination of a trekking tour, organized by us. The tour will be led by an official guide of the National Park and will be a mixed experience:- trekking path from Vernazza to the sanctuary.- visit to the sanctuary, where a guide will explain its history and show its hidden gems.- visit to our olive grove, with a lesson on the olive cultivation, the oil production in the Cinque Terre and the importance of this activity for the culture and economy of our territory.The tour will conclude with the tasting of our oil and an aperitif, overlooking the stunning sea of the Cinque Terre. Your donations will therefore be used to create the tasting and relax area, where the visitors could rest after trekking. All the services we offer have a special aim: we want to make sure that our tourists understand the importance of the preservation of our territory, the value of agriculture, hard work and good food.  Here in Wild Farm Curnigia, we are well aware that the Cinque Terre is one of the most popular destination in the world. What we hope is to create a slower kind of tourism and make sure the tourists are attentive to what they see. The goal of our project is to create a company with a new concept, which can have a positive impact on the environment and its community through its work.The work to be done is a lot but we are ready!We hope you enjoyed our project and to thank you we have created some fantastic rewards for you!__________With a view to total transparency we want to present in detail all the costs we will incur to start, as presented before, the Wild Farm in Corniglia and the olive grove in Loc. Reggio: We want to share with you some pic of the work we did!you can check our social page! Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/WildFarmCurnigia/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/wild_farm_curnigia/  Web Site: https://wildfarmcurnigia.com Our  mail: wildfarmcurnigia@gmail.com  If you like our project share with your friends to support us!Thanks!___________________________________________LA NOSTRA STORIA: Ciao, siamo Lorenzo, Niccolò e Gianpaolo, amici sin dal tempo del liceo e, dopo aver concluso gli studi universitari abbiamo deciso di creare un progetto di sviluppo sostenibile, che abbia un impatto positivo per il nostro territorio.Io, Niccolò, provengo da una formazione universitaria in Scienze Politiche Internazionali, sono appassionato di viaggi, anche grazie alle molte esperienze fatte all'interno del programma Erasmus+; sono molto attivo sul territorio, partecipando a eventi di volontariato con associazioni e cooperative locali, come il presidio Morvillo di Libera. Ho inoltre sviluppato competenze digitali nell’ambito dei social media, web design ed e-commerce.Io, Lorenzo, vivo da sempre nelle Cinque Terre, e conosco profondamente la cultura e i problemi di questo territorio. Ho completato il percorso di studi in Turismo e Sviluppo del Territorio; sono inoltre impegnato in ambito sociale e politico all’interno del Parco Nazionale delle Cinque Terre, ricoprendo il ruolo di Presidente della Consulta dei Giovani.Io, Gianpaolo, da sempre vivo nelle Cinque Terre e da sempre sono impegnato, anche dal punto di vista lavorativo, in questo territorio. Amo considerarmi come un custode delle antiche tradizioni rurali e marinare della mia terra che, dalle generazioni che ci hanno preceduto, vengono tramandate a noi giovani.Da questo forte sentimento di appartenenza ai nostri luoghi, prende forma l’idea di salvaguardare e ripristinare il territorio, per far sì che anche le generazioni future possano trarne i valori, gli insegnamenti, e possano anche goderne la bellezza, elementi che contraddistinguono il Parco Nazionale delle Cinque Terre, rendendolo unico nel mondo. Dalla passione e dall’attenzione per la nostra terra, quindi, è nata l'idea di creare un'Azienda Agricola 2.0 all’interno del territorio del Parco Nazionale delle Cinque Terre, con l’obbiettivo principale di portare un importante contributo alla sua tutela ed alla salvaguardia rispetto ai danni derivanti dall’incuria e dall’abbandono. Da sinistra: Lorenzo, Gianpaolo e NiccolòDOVE NASCE IL NOSTRO PROGETTO :Vivendo da sempre in questi luoghi unici, ci siamo resi conto che, già insita nella loro particolare bellezza, esiste una estrema fragilità.Le Cinque Terre, infatti, sono piccole e fragili, ed in venir meno, nel corso degli ultimi decenni, della paziente, lenta e costante opera dell’uomo porta a far crollare quel peculiare equilibrio tra insediamento umano e Natura, che in questi luoghi ha raggiunto caratteristiche uniche, di una instabile e precaria perfezione.Il principale e maggiore pericolo che incombe sul territorio delle Cinque Terre è sicuramente rappresentato dal dissesto idrogeologico, causato dall'abbandono dei terreni e dalla mancanza di adeguata manutenzione.Ogni anno il rischio di un'alluvione è sempre altissimo; resteranno per sempre indelebili nella memoria degli abitanti delle Cinque Terre, gli immensi danni e il dolore causati dalla famosa alluvione del 25 Novembre 2011.Anche se eventi catastrofici di tale portata per fortuna, non si sono ripetuti, però ogni stagione invernale, quando le piogge si fanno più intense, si verificano comunque molti danni; frequentemente franano i muretti a secco, che delle Cinque Terre sono il simbolo e la colonna vertebrale, si lesionano le strade di accesso, e l'integrità del territorio viene costantemente minacciata da uno stillicidio di frane, con grave pericolo ed enormi disagi per la popolazione residente e per i visitatori. Vogliamo sottolineare, inoltre, che un territorio così fragile come il nostro, non trova certo un aiuto da un tipo dal turismo sregolato e di massa, che ogni anno conduce nelle Cinque Terre oltre 4 milioni di visitatori, senza però un sistema che consenta la corretta gestione di tale flusso turistico, in un’ottica che non sia solo di profitto a corto respiro, ma che, invece, sia anche orientata alla salvaguardia ambientale.  IL NOSTRO PROGETTO: L’idea di WILD FARM CÜRNIGIA nasce proprio per combattere e trovare rimedio ai danni causati, da un lato dall’abbandono delle terre, e dall’altro, dal turismo di massa. WILD FARM CÜRNIGIA, nelle nostre intenzioni, sarà un'Azienda Agricola 2.0 con un impatto ambientale negativo (inferiore a 0), poiché verrà recuperato e ripristinato il territorio su cui sorgerà la fattoria, oggi completamente abbandonato ed in avanzato stato di degrado.Si verrà così a creare una nuovissima tipologia di offerta di visita e fruizione, grazie alla quale chi lo vorrà potrà finalmente scoprire e davvero vivere a fondo l'essenza delle Cinque Terre, di un territorio difficile e splendido, della gente, aspra ma genuina, delle tradizioni e dei prodotti tipici, e tutto questo in una chiave Slow. Il progetto della nostra Azienda Agricola non si ferma solo al recupero e ripristino dei terreni abbandonati e del ritorno alla produzione agricola dei prodotti locali tipici, ma vuole anche offrire una serie di servizi turistici, pensati ed organizzati in chiave Slow, così da portare i visitatori a comprendere l’effimera e fragile bellezza del territorio, ed a condividere, insieme alle popolazioni locali, la scelta di valorizzarlo, rispettarlo e difenderlo.  Inoltre, la nostra Wild Farm si propone l’obbiettivo di dare vita e prendere parte ad alcune iniziative di natura sociale, nella convinzione che lo sviluppo economico debba andare di pari passo con lo sviluppo e la consapevolezza sociale. Da una parte, si contribuirà all’inserimento nel mondo del lavoro e nella società attiva, di ragazzi rifugiati ed immigrati, attraverso programmi di inclusione lavorativa, in collaborazione con gli Enti preposti. Dall’altra parte, vi sarà la creazione di attività e workshops, in collaborazione con gli Enti locali e gli istituti scolastici delle Cinque Terre, al fine di coinvolgere i bambini nella riscoperta del proprio territorio. CHE COSA ABBIAMO FATTO:Abbiamo già iniziato a lavorare sodo per dare vita al nostro sogno, e per salvaguardare il territorio delle Cinque Terre, ed in pochi mesi, abbiamo già raggiunto interessanti risultati!!! Per cominciare, abbiamo ottenuto la disponibilità di più di 1000 m2 di terreni , le famose terrazze delle Cinque Terre, da tempo abbandonate, nei pressi del paese di Corniglia: i terreni sono stati completamente disboscati, ripristinati e sono pronti per essere coltivati. Per rendere accessibili le terrazze, per garantire la sicurezza del nostro lavoro e del territorio, abbiamo ricostruito diversi metri cubi di muretti a secco ormai crollati, dissotterrando e riposizionando le pietre franate degli antichi muretti. In questi terreni abbiamo rinvenuto le tracce di un antico pollaio, che è stato ricostruito, ingrandito e reso funzionale e comodo per le nostre ospiti galline capitanate dal pugnace gallo Tito, in una struttura a prova delle incursioni notturne di volpi e faine. Le ruspanti pennute sono in attesa di accogliere a breve nuove ospiti, una paperotta ed una simpatica ochetta, che – ancora piccole – sono accudite nella nostra nursery. Inoltre, mano a mano che ripristiniamo i terrazzamenti, procediamo con la messa a dimora di molteplici specie di piante e fiori, così da favorire la biodiversità, agevolando anche lo sviluppo di api ed alveari; è stato creato un vero e proprio giardino delle erbe aromatiche, largamente impiegate nella cucina locale. Oltre alle opere intraprese nei terreni a Corniglia, abbiamo recentemente ottenuto la disponibilità di un bellissimo uliveto, nei pressi del famoso Santuario di Nostra di Signora di Reggio.Ciò consentirà alla nostra piccola azienda di sviluppare un progetto di ulivocoltura e di produzione di olio, molto interessante ed impegnativo, sia dal punto di vista agricolo che turistico.ORA PERO' ABBIAMO BISOGNO DEL VOSTRO AIUTO PER CONTINUARE IN QUESTO NOSTRO SOGNO DI WILD FARM CURNIGIA CHE COSA VOGLIAMO FARE:Attraverso questa campagna CrowdFounding, noi saremo finalmente in grado di dare la scintilla iniziale alla nostra Wild Farm Cürnigia. Nello specifico, il progetto che andremo a realizzare può essere descritto in due sezioni:Zona Wild Farm Curnigia: Grazie alle vostre donazioni sarà creata una zona di visite nei nostri terreni, facilmente raggiungibile dalla stazione ferroviaria di Corniglia. Sulla collina che sovrasta la stazione sarà attrezzato un percorso sensoriale, unico nel suo genere, inframezzato da informazioni sulla vita rurale delle Cinque Terre, e sui bisogni del territorio. Il percorso di visita comprenderà: PERCORSO A PIEDI NUDI per essere e sentirsi davvero a contatto diretto con le Cinque Terre;GIARDINO DELLE ERBE AROMATICHE per esplorare con i sensi dell’olfatto, della vista, del tatto la biodiversità e la bellezza della natura. CONI DELL’ASCOLTO per fare esperienza della nostra terra in tranquillità e, completamente separati dal resto. PERCORSO TRA I LIMONI per scoprire il gusto, l’odore e la bellezza dei nostri limoni e confrontarlo con altri nostri prodotti come i nostri piccanti peperoncini, l'amaro della rucola e il dolce dei fichi maturi!Come detto, sinora abbiamo effettivamente realizzato il giardino delle erbe aromatiche, ed il pollaio con gli animali da cortile. Utilizzeremo quindi parte delle donazioni derivanti da questa campagna per implementare anche le altre attività progettate (percorso a piedi nudi, tra i limoni, coni dell’ascolto), e per dotare tutti i percorsi dei necessari dispositivi, ringhiere e recinzioni per garantire la sicurezza dei visitatori. Inoltre, al fine di avere un’impresa con il più basso impatto ambientale possibile, utilizzeremo parte delle vostre donazioni per piantare in questi terreni più di 30 alberi da frutto e più di 100 piante di fiori ULIVETO:Utilizzeremo l’uliveto sottostante il Santuario di Reggio come meta di arrivo di un tour di trekking da noi organizzato. Il tour sarà condotto da una guida ufficiale del Parco Nazionale e costituirà un’esperienza mista: -percorso di trekking da Vernazza fino al Santuario; -visita al Santuario, con approfondimento della sua storia, e la scoperta delle perle nascoste;-visita al nostro uliveto con lezione sulla coltura dell’ulivo, e sulla produzione dell’olio nelle Cinque Terre, e l’importanza che riveste nella cultura e nell’economia del territorio. -Il tour si concluderà con la degustazione dell’olio delle Cinque Terre e l’aperitivo con vista sullo splendido mare delle Cinque Terre. Utilizzeremo, quindi, i vostri contributi per costruire la zona degustazione-relax, in cui i visitatori potranno riposarsi dopo lo sforzo del trekking. I servizi che abbiamo intenzione di offrire sono pensati in ottica di catturare e condurre l’attenzione dei turisti su temi fondamentali come la preservazione del nostro territorio, i valori dell’agricoltura, del lavoro e del buon cibo. Questo perché noi di Wild Farm Curnigia siamo ben consapevoli che le Cinque Terre sono una delle più gettonate mete turistiche del mondo, perciò speriamo di poter indirizzare il flusso turismo verso una direzione più SLOW e attenta a ciò che ha intorno e che viene a conoscere.  L'obiettivo del nostro progetto è quello di creare un'azienda con un nuovo concept, che possa attraverso il suo lavoro avere un'impatto positivo sull'ambiente e sulla propria comunità.Il Lavoro da fare è tanto ma noi siamo pronti!Speriamo che il nostro progetto vi sia piaciuto e per ringraziarvi abbiamo creato delle fantastiche ricompense per voi!_________In ottica di una totale trasparenza vi vogliamo presentare nel dettaglio tutti i costi che andremo a sostenere per avviare, come presentato prima, la Wild Farm a Corniglia e l'uliveto in Loc.

<h2>Hoi, </h2>
<p>Sherida hier, het PLANTBEEST in kwestie! Maker van plantaardige alternatieven voor alles wat je mist sinds je dagen als omnivoor of ervan weerhoudt om plantaardig te leven!</p>
</div><div>
<p>Hoewel ik sinds 2017 veganistisch eet en een hoop jaren daarvoor al vegetariër was, zijn er altijd bepaalde cravings geweest die nooit zijn verdwenen. Daarnaast had ik destijds een omnivoor in huis die af en toe spareribs in een hoekje zat weg te knagen en mopperde dat hij best een vegan versie zou eten als die dingen tenminste te vreten waren. </p>
<p>Creatieve oplossingen bedenken is 1 van mijn sterkste eigenschappen dus challenge accepted! Ik begon te experimenteren met dingen zoals chicken wings en ribs, goed afkijkend bij vooral de Aziatische keukens waar ze al tijden wisten hoe je vleesvervangers kon maken voor tempelmaaltijden en ging daarna door met kazen en visvervangers voor vrienden en kennissen. Tussendoor rommelde ik ook lekker in de keuken om recepten te maken voor andere mensen en deze online te delen. Ondanks de berg aan positieve reacties en uitspraken van mensen die riepen ""Oh, als ik ooit bij jou kan bestellen.."" was ik er nog niet toe om professioneel te gaan produceren. Wel noemde ik het voor de grap mijn 'backup plan' voor als ik ooit mijn (behoorlijk stressvolle) baan als videogames ontwikkelaar helemaal zat zou worden.</p>
<p>In oktober 2020 was het moment eindelijk, de realisatie dat mijn werk me niet gelukkig maakte en 2 uur later lag de eerste draft voor PLANTBEEST Kitchen op tafel.</p>
<p>Met hulp, advies en aanmoediging van de fantastische mensen om me heen heb ik in een hele korte tijd een pilot kunnen opzetten om PLANTBEEST van de grond te krijgen. Tot mijn grote verrassing bleken de reacties zo positief dat mijn keuken van 8m2 de vraag nauwelijks meer kon bijbenen. Inmiddels is de vraag zo groot dat alles binnen enkele uren volledig is uitverkocht! </p>
<p>Heel vervelend voor iedereen die telkens net achter het net vist maar ook voor mijzelf omdat ik sta te trappelen om het assortiment uit te breiden!</p>

<h3>Wat maakt PLANTBEEST speciaal?</h3>
<p>Een PLANTBEEST product moet aan een aantal verwachtingen voldoen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Realistische smaak en textuur</li>
<li>Stilt de lekkere trek naar de dierlijke variant</li>
<li>Zo min mogelijk rare toevoegingen </li>
<li>Goede verse ingrediënten</li>
<li>Makkelijk te verwerken of bereiden</li>
<li>Ruime porties</li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Waar wordt het geld voor gebruikt?</h3>
<p>PLANTBEEST moet dringend groeien om de huidige vraag te kunnen beantwoorden, daarom heb ik voor de begroting gekeken naar wat er echt noodzakelijk is en wat iets minder urgent is. Het doelbedrag van €18.400 is gericht om te kunnen starten met een nieuwe keuken en wordt gebruikt om de huur van een pand voor 6 maanden te bekostigen plus het leasen van apparatuur voor dezelfde periode.</p>
<p>Met deze apparatuur kunnen de PLANTBEEST producten sneller en efficiënter worden geproduceerd zodat de productie omhoog kan. Een automatische worstenvuller zorgt bijv. voor minder blessures en een grotere oplage.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Is er een risico?</h3>
<p>Op dit moment zijn de middelen en ruimte al beschikbaar om de PLANTBEEST producten te kunnen produceren ( op een trage, inefficiënte manier). De beloningen kunnen daarom zonder probleem geleverd worden. </p>
<p>Het vinden van een goede ruimte en de inrichting zal enige tijd in beslag nemen maar zodra dit gerealiseerd is kan de keuken na een korte inwerktijd worden gebruikt voor de opgeschaalde productie.

<h3>I've got the amazing opportunity to move Cheeky's Vintage from a Pop Up to a Storefront!</h3>
<p>As many of you know, I have been dreaming of a storefront for my vintage business, but knew it might take years to find the perfect opportunity. But I think the stars have aligned to give me a chance to start out on a small scale in a gorgeous space in Hyattsville, Maryland.</p>
<p>A local artist has offered me the chance to sublet her space in a beautiful building, starting in mid-September--just as people start to think about holiday shopping.</p>
<p>I knew the minute I saw the space that it would be perfect and that it would provide a great opportunity to take Cheeky's Vintage to the next level. I'm also a little nervous and I need some help to make this dream come true.</p>
<p>I'm hoping to raise $5,000 for my start up costs, which include securing the space, marketing, sales systems and some cosmetic work to get the space in shape.</p>
<p>I've been so grateful to so many friends and family who have purchased items from me and given me advice and support as I started Cheeky's and I would be so thankful for your support as I take this next big leap.</p>
<p>I know that no one would advise starting a retail business during a pandemic; but it's also true that there's a passion for supporting local businesses right now and vintage wares have been gaining popularity over the last several years. The success of my Pop-Up and online sales also gives me the confidence to give my dream a go and I'd love your support to make it happen.</p>
<p>In my perfect world, this kick starts a retail space that will grow over the years and one day let me hire my son Cash and others with intellectual disabilities as employees...which is real reason I started thinking about owning a small retail business years ago.</p>
</div><p>All of my supporters will receive a 10% discount on their first (or next!) Cheeky's Vintage purchase. </p><p>Thank you for considering supporting Cheeky's Vintage. I'm grateful for the support you've already given me.</p><p> </p></div>","I've got the amazing opportunity to move Cheeky's Vintage from a Pop Up to a Storefront!

<h3>More Than Just a Fitness Regimen</h3>
<p>I fell in love with pole dance when I was studying in London, and it kept me sane and fit when I was overworked and burning out in New York. At Body &amp; Pole in New York, I discovered my people: strong and smart women who knew how to be the boss at the office, but loved to let their hair down and release their inner daredevil diva in the studio.</p>
<p>A good pole studio is more than just a place to dance and train, it's a place that fosters creativity, discipline, and body-positivity. It's a supportive community that pushes you to get out of your comfort zone, builds your confidence, and challenges you to WERK and be your best self.</p>
<p>Now that I've moved back to Chiang Mai to be my own boss and to rediscover this wonderful city, I would love to share my passion with others. Please help me to start Chiang Mai's first dedicated pole studio, and discover a better way to work out!</p>

<h3>So What's the Deal With This Campaign?</h3>
<p>I'm looking for $3000 USD (~ ฿98,000 THB) to fund:</p>

I fell in love with pole dance when I was studying in London, and it kept me sane and fit when I was overworked and burning out in New York.

As Obama landed in the Tel Aviv airport for his first official visit to Israel last month, a group of Palestinians, joined by a few Israelis and internationals, attempted to remind the President of the movement which made his election possible.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
If you ever had a website, the first thing that comes to mind after adding all your images and content is: How do I attract visitors? There are today a few options such as pay-per-click, SEO and social networking. I don't think these options are good enough, and have decided to start a project that will attract visitors to your website in a completely new way. Try the proof of concept website here: <a href=""http://lewt.it"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Lewt.it"">http://lewt.it</a>.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Lewt combines looting in computer games (Diablo, Super Mario Bros. etc.) with website marketing. Imagine having hordes of visitors all fighting over your marketing budget, while you have full control over how they are rewarded. A click on a link, button, or any other clickable web object can give a monetary reward for visitors, and will keep them addicted to using your website. Be more specific and define CSS id's and class names that give loot, and give a bonus to visitors that use your site ""correctly"". Collect anonymous statistics about how your visitors navigate your website and much more!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Who am I? I am a passionate entrepreneur and developer from Sweden, currently living in Cairns, Australia. I have created an e-commerce platform for small business owners (<a href=""http://www.noobtrader.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.noobtrader.com</a>) and most recently a student room-sharing service (<a href=""http://www.roomspots.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.roomspots.com</a>) as well as other online content management systems. I have never been as excited about a project as I am for this, and can't stop thinking about all the features I will implement!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I will need $20,000 to make this project a serious contender to all other web marketing techniques available today. I plan to team up with a web security specialist and a marketing guru, and make this project a very disruptive online marketing company. If you support this project, I will make sure you are well rewarded:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beta access, try the service on your own websites and give feedback</li>
<li>Free memberships for a year or lifetime</li>
<li>Be part of the logo and website design process</li>
<li>Have loot achievements with your own graphics and name</li>
<li>Have your website listed on the lewt case studies page</li>
<li>Have your logo with link appear on the home page as top sponsor</li>
<li>Be an advisor to the project team and have a say in all major decisions up until the project goes live</li>
</ul>
<p>The funds will first be used for creating the member pages and securing the entire process, with Paypal and other payment systems being implemented. Then, all exciting visual features and rewards will be implemented such as achievements, badges, loot options (timed ""raids"", first to complete an achievement and much more). Any extra funds remaining after a solid application has been built will be used for marketing and spreading the word on all platforms, including mobile.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I believe this project has enormous potential, in fact I get more ideas the more I think about its possibilities. It will allow anyone to quickly attract - and keep - visitors on their website, instead of hoping that they will be interested after clicking an online ad. Being able to see exactly how visitors navigate on your website is an advanced feature that is very useful for improving sales or website useability. Also, having fun while you are providing value or content to a website is a win-win situation.</p>

<p>My name is Erin West.  I currently work full-time in Wellness and Community Health.  In 2013 my daughter, Riley and I, along with a friend created Kindredhouse - a non-profit 501(c)(3) community-level aid organization in Cambodia. At Kindredhouse we care about creating a better future for Cambodians and ensuring the sustainability of Chansor Hospital as well as health education programs for the community. </p>
<p>Cambodia is a country deeply scarred by mass genocide committed from 1975 – 1979. This tragedy killed an estimated 1.7 million people, among them the most educated or professional citizens, leaving future generations with few role models and opportunities. When I first visited Cambodia in 2006, I discovered a country rich in culture, history and beauty, but desperately lacking basic medical care and health education. Now with the support of financial supporters and a team of over 25 committed volunteers, Kindredhouse provides medical supplies, medications, health education and support to Chansor Commune Hospital.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our Impact<br/>
Chansor is a village or 'commune' within Soutr Nikum District, Siem Reap Province. The region consists of 20 villages and the Chansor Hospital serves approximately 15,000 people.

<p>erinw@kindredhouse.org</p><p></p></div>","My name is Erin West.  I currently work full-time in Wellness and Community Health.  In 2013 my daughter, Riley and I, along with a friend created Kindredhouse - a non-profit 501(c)(3) community-level aid organization in Cambodia. At Kindredhouse we care about creating a better future for Cambodians and ensuring the sustainability of Chansor Hospital as well as health education programs for the community. 
Cambodia is a country deeply scarred by mass genocide committed from 1975 – 1979. This tragedy killed an estimated 1.7 million people, among them the most educated or professional citizens, leaving future generations with few role models and opportunities. When I first visited Cambodia in 2006, I discovered a country rich in culture, history and beauty, but desperately lacking basic medical care and health education. Now with the support of financial supporters and a team of over 25 committed volunteers, Kindredhouse provides medical supplies, medications, health education and support to Chansor Commune Hospital.

Our Impact
Chansor is a village or 'commune' within Soutr Nikum District, Siem Reap Province. The region consists of 20 villages and the Chansor Hospital serves approximately 15,000 people. There is one physician who travels to the area on a part-time basis. Kindredhouse has provided support and medications to Chansor Hospital since inception with the goal of increasing effective delivery of basic healthcare needs to community members.  Recently, we returned from an aid trip to Chansor wherein 18 volunteers provided enough medications and medical supplies to effectively address medical needs for 6 months.  
In order to move forward, Chansor Hospital desperately needs some construction in and around the building.  The roof leaks horribly and a pig farm adjacent to the hospital grounds floods into the building during the rainy season (July-November) bringing filth and disease which makes it impossible to provide a clean, effective and sterile environment for adequate medical care.  There are challenges along the way to our goal - some of which are; language barriers, Chansor community is very rural and organizing a group to assess need is difficult, and of course, financial concerns.  We are prepared to face these challenges with proper planning, experience within the country, local support and the help of experts.  We have been asked by the community to help.  They have expressed their needs, desires and love and we feel confident we can overcome these obstacles.

<h3>Short Summary:</h3>
<p>In recent years i have been working in a simple graphical real-time circuit simulator in my sparse time.</p>
<p>I actually have the ""bare bones"" working, that is: the gui, circuit simulator core and the interface to a good avr simulator (simavr). So it's possible to simulate an avr microcontroller hooked to external electronics components at real time. This is what you can see in the video.</p>
<p>Now i want to have some arduino boards and shields integrated in the simulator as well as develop it to be an usable aplication for everyone and release it as open source software.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Brief description of the simulator:</h3>
<p><strong>The core</strong> of the aplication is an electric circuit solver and a set of basic electronic elements, it's written to be gui-independent, so it could be used in other guis.</p>
<p><strong>The gui</strong> uses Qt C++ framework, so it's platform independent and takes advantage of all the high-level facilities that Qt provides. </p>
<p><strong>The avr simulation</strong> is done by a lightweight, fast C simulator (simavr) interfaced directly to the graphic pins trough efficient IRQ hooks. So it's possible to simulate an avr 16 Mhz at real time in a Pentium-D 2,8 Ghz (60% cpu load).</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Goals:</h3>
<p>- Develop the gui to be easy to use and bug-free.</p>
<p>- Add a basic set of graphical electronic components.</p>
<p>- Add a basic set of output devices, including 7-seg dispalys, lcd...</p>
<p>- Integrate a basic set of Arduino Hardware: boards and shields.</p>
<p>- Add a plotter and an oscillocope view.</p>
<p>- Port to as many platforms as possible, at least Linux and Windows.</p>
<p>- Translate to as many languages as possible, at least English and Spanish.</p>

<h3><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: small; font-weight: normal;"">Hello, my name is David Patrick, for years I had a longing to travel the world. Not just on my own, but to share it with others who have the same passion as I do to see new places, cultures and people. Starting in 1998, I have been involved in the tourism industry in a multitude of capacities. I spent 6 seasons in Breckenridge, CO working for Vail Resorts. In March of 2005, I joined the Trek America team leading tours and driving for 4 years from Mexico to the Arctic Ocean, Los Angeles to New York City. After a brief hiatus in graduate school and teaching chemistry, I returned to the road working for Dragoman in the Middle East along with Eastern/Southern Africa and South America. </span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">I love what I do and the initial focus of Infinite Adventures is to highlight the amazing beauty and adventures available in the wilds of Alaska. Over time, the hope is to grow the adventures offered on down through Western Canada and the lower-48. I want to be your expert on all things North America!</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">The reason for my campaign is to be assisted in developing in an overland vehicle. I would love to build a vehicle from scratch but this would cost close to $150,000. Way too much for a startup to invest and expect to grow and become profitable within it's first few years. So, I've decided on the next best option; which is to take an old bus and refurbish it to my specifications where we will have a backlocker (luggage storage), 20 seats, 2 tables, a refrigerator, overhead lockers, exterior storage compartments, and a roof rack with viewing platform along with other vital amenities.

</div></div>","Hello, my name is David Patrick, for years I had a longing to travel the world. Not just on my own, but to share it with others who have the same passion as I do to see new places, cultures and people. Starting in 1998, I have been involved in the tourism industry in a multitude of capacities. I spent 6 seasons in Breckenridge, CO working for Vail Resorts. In March of 2005, I joined the Trek America team leading tours and driving for 4 years from Mexico to the Arctic Ocean, Los Angeles to New York City. After a brief hiatus in graduate school and teaching chemistry, I returned to the road working for Dragoman in the Middle East along with Eastern/Southern Africa and South America. 
I love what I do and the initial focus of Infinite Adventures is to highlight the amazing beauty and adventures available in the wilds of Alaska. Over time, the hope is to grow the adventures offered on down through Western Canada and the lower-48. I want to be your expert on all things North America!
The reason for my campaign is to be assisted in developing in an overland vehicle. I would love to build a vehicle from scratch but this would cost close to $150,000. Way too much for a startup to invest and expect to grow and become profitable within it's first few years. So, I've decided on the next best option; which is to take an old bus and refurbish it to my specifications where we will have a backlocker (luggage storage), 20 seats, 2 tables, a refrigerator, overhead lockers, exterior storage compartments, and a roof rack with viewing platform along with other vital amenities. This type of vehicle is commonly being used in tours throughout the world, except here in North America. If I can develop the first of its kind here, I believe that Infinite Adventures will see remarkable growth within it's formitive years.
I believe that this undertaking is the next step in the tourism industry here in the states. With gas/diesel prices continuing to rise, the need for travelers to utilize these types of small group adventure tours will continue to grow. Your contributions to my small business will be a great spring board in being ready to get the wheels rolling May 2013.
Infinite Adventures is looking to raise $15,000 towards the initial purchase of our overland vehicle. With the experience gained leading tours in the Middle East, Africa, South and North America, we know what sights and experiences our clients are looking forward to, as well as the ones that haven't even crossed their minds.

Compared to the competition who utilizes 15 passenger vans, this vehicle gives you the space to stretch your legs, walk around while moving, play cards or write your journal, and when you see that amazing photo, you don't have to clamor over your neighbor to get it. 
Even if our goal isn't met, the funds you donate will go directly to either the vehicle's purchase or the refurbishing project. 
Please help me achieve my dream to show the world how amazing North America is with its' nature, geology, and culture.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Audrianna Talavera and I am co-director of Community Boost Consulting, a non-profit consulting firm based in San Diego. ProjectFLITE (<em>Fostering leadership &amp; Independence through entrepreneurship) </em>is an initiative we're taking on in partnership with Empowered Youth to transform 6 at-risk youth into entrepreneurs &amp; venture capitalists by the end of an intenstive 10-week program. They will be starting, running, and growing their own businesses during these 10 weeks. </p>
<p>The program will culminate in them flying out to San Diego to pitch their journey to over 100 entrepreneurs and venture capitalists at StartUp Grind San Diego on July 7 and we need YOUR help to make this happen! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Funds from this campaign will go towards paying for 9 flights (the 6 boys, their 2 mentors, and the founder of Empowered Youth) and their room &amp; board while they are here. Most of them have never been on a plane before!    </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I think everyone can relate when I say life isn't easy sometimes, but ""not easy"" is a very relative term. After hearing the stories of these 6 boys, it's hard to every think anything was a struggle in your own life. The circumstances these boys were under at such a young age were heart-wrenching to learn about. To see how determined and committed they are to break the cycle and create a bright, succesful future is incredibly inspiring. Your contribution will help make that bright, successful future a reality. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We completely understand if you cannot make a donation today. If you could take the time to share this with friends and family we would be extrememly grateful! </p>
<p>Or if you want to read about the boys' journeys, they will be posting weekly blogs and vlogs here: <a href=""https://communityboostconsulting.org/category/project-flite/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://communityboostconsulting.org/category/project-flite/</a></p>

<h3>Dear Friends,<br/> Everyday is a fun day for us. We always get to see new faces walk through our doors, excited to see the glowing screens and hear the pew-pew noises from each arcade and pinball machine. It’s fun to make new friends that remember playing these arcade games when they were a kid or watching parents with their little ones, huddled over a game and cheering with their son or daughter as they jump that barrel, stomp on the turtle, or shoot that last spaceship.<br/><br/> We always hear you guys and gals cheer, “Thank you for doing this, for opening up in my neighborhood.”… And we always respond with, “Hey if it wasn’t for you guys showing up, we wouldn’t have a fun place for you guys to hang out”.<br/><br/><br/> But the way things are going, Rusty Quarters might have shut our doors forever.<br/><br/><br/> Recently we’ve seen a drastic decline in attendance. Drastic enough that it is affecting our day-to-day business. Some of this is due to the recent moody weather (warm/cold/warm/snow/cold). Some is due to a newer and more fancy arcade that recently opened up in the MPLS area. And some may be just for the fact that the novelty of bringing a retro video arcade back to life has just faded by way of the dinosaur…<br/><br/> We are currently in a high rent lease, locked in for almost 2 more years (lease is up in 11/2014). We started this labor of love with a very small shoestring budget. We have spent every penny to keep us open. We've sold cars, tiki mugs, shirts, and every other personal bauble to keep this place going. We've looked into second jobs to make ends meet but are shut down with words like, ""You're overqualified"" or ""I can't hire someone that's just going to quit right after their business picks up"". We have exhausted all of our savings and because of slow attendance we've been a bit shy of the rent for a few months, leaving us in the red with our landlords for $8,000 in compiled back rent...</h3>
<h3>The fact is that THE RENT IS JUST TOO DAMN HIGH! We’ve tried our best get a Small Business loan but have been denied at every turn. (Turns out, you have to have money to borrow money) And it turns out that we are too small of retail space for a food/alcohol license. All we can do is try our best to get better attendance and keep Rusty Quarters open for 2 more years until we can find a larger place with cheaper rent, a proper HVAC system, running water and a grill. <br/><br/> Bottom Line, if business doesn’t pick up soon for Rusty Quarters, we will have to close our doors June 1st.<br/><br/> In conjunction with asking for donations, we just hope that if you get bored around the house, had a hard day at work, need to do something fun with the kids, or just need a cheap date night, you’ll decide to stop by your neighborhood arcade and spend a couple of quarters. Relax with fan favorites such as Donkey Kong, Galaga, Rampage, Ms. Pac-Man, Tekken, etc. Also, keep us in mind for your next birthday party or event. Revenue from those activities make up for those slow days...</h3>
<h3>But if you really want to help us out, we're willing to make it worth your while with a list of Donation Perks which may be found on the right of the screen. Even though we've set our perks to $5 Donations, you are welcome to donate as much as you want.<br/><br/> Also, please join our Facebook page and spread the word to your friends and family that there is a fun place in town to spend your afternoon/evening.<br/><br/>We do understand that this is our second donation drive (we needed your help back in 04/12) and would like to thank everyone in the past that has help to keep us open through these hard economic times. Once again time are tough for us at Rusty Quarters and hope with your continue support of our business, we'll be here for your retro video game needs for years to come.<br/><br/> We’re not asking for all of your hard earned money. All we’re asking for are your spare quarters, which believe it or not truly add up. With your continued support of this neighborhood small business, we’ll keep you guys playing with new games in a kid safe and clean environment...

Led by an instructor who has developed strong working relationships with community organizations in Decatur, Illinois, we use our experiences in recitals, mainstage productions, and arts entrepreneurship to enhance our community through collaborative, arts-based projects.
What We Are Doing:

Macon County, Illinois is one of the least healthy counties in the state, with exceptionally high rates of smoking, obesity, and teen pregnancy. in the face of mounting budget cuts, the Macon County Health Department (MCHD), located in Decatur, Illinois, is looking for innovative ways to reach their diverse constituents and promote positive public health messages. Therefore, we are collaborating withMCHDto revitalize their lobby. Serving several diverse constituencies, the spaceis loud, unorganized, and does not create a positive community environment. In consultation with MCHD staff and administration, we have developed an arts-based solution that will allow the MCHD lobby to serve as a positive and inviting space for the patients that utilize the department’s services. We also hope to promote the idea of a healthy lifestyle through our artistic contribution to the center via iconic artwork.

A general theme for the redevelopment is to create a more modern, chic, but still professional atmosphere. After surveying MCHD staff, it has become clear that noise levels, exacerbated by high ceilings, create a challenging work environment, and anecdotal evidence suggests that clients also find the noise and institutional look of the lobby to be offputting. To combat theseissues, we will be adding color to the walls and  designing fabric tapestries throughout the space to create a more inviting, professional setting. Tapestries will help to absorb sound and diminish reverb within the main space, while strategically located, hypoallergenic plants and miniature trees will bring a much-needed natural element into the space.Additionally, because the Health Department serves Macon County’s diverse population including all ages, we will install a children’s playspace to cater to families as well as providing a separate area for a more solitary experience.
 
How We Will Use The Money:
 
Money awarded as well as fundraised by our project team will be used solely for the materials used to implement our design. A breakdown of this is listed below. We will perform all labor to minimize costs and maximize our contribution.

<p>Don Louis:</p>
<p>I'm the primary Photographer and Videographer for Frame of Mind. I've always loved video, and I've wanted to be a film maker since I was seven years old. I have always had a strong passion for film, and I want to start now while I'm young.  To have the experience and to be able to make a living doing what I love is very important to me. I want to make people happy and give them a result they can be happy with. Also, I couldn't ask for a better team than Davylyn and Josh. I would be so grateful for any help with this dream. </p>

<p>Davylyn Shaddinger:</p>
<p> I'm the web designer, marketer, organizer, and more. I am an amputee and have been since birth.I have amputations on every limb to some extent (missing leg, toes and fingers). I have always worked very hard in my life. I was an excellent student all my years up through college. I studied to be an elementary school teacher. However, upon getting my first job, I found that a 9-5 job of any kind was too hard on my leg. I would love to be able to work from home as Frame of Mind's behind the scenes coordinator. I would appreciate any help in making it a reality for me to help support my husband and future family. </p>

<p>Joshua Shaddinger: </p>
<p>I am the secondary photographer and videographer. I also handle all the legalities like registering, taxes and the non-fun things Don and Davy don't want to deal with.   I owned my own business all of my adult life, but moved to Arizona for my wife, and I am looking for a career change. I want to be able to provide for my family, and ask for your help. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, with Don's talent, Davy's design and organizationals skills, and Josh's legal skills, we've got a pretty grand business in the making. But we need your help. We need funding to make this a reality! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are hoping to raise in total $2,600.This will cover multiple business expenses:  </p>
<p> -Surgery for Davy ($1000)</p>
<p>- Part of our home and office rent (3 months rent $900)</p>
<p>- Finishing our legal registration like getting a tradename and our logo trademarked. ($150)</p>
<p>- A tertiary camera to force Davy to learn photography ($119)</p>
<p>- A new tripod for our Canon T4I ($100)</p>
<p>- New Business Cards with our website ($50)</p>
<p>- Studio Lighting ($200)</p>
<p>- A new, secondary T4I so we can have multiple angles ($879)</p>
<p>- Advertising space at our local wedding gallery ($300 for 6 months)</p>
<p>- Advertising in our local magazine ($500 for six months)</p>
<p>- Canon 50mm lens ($150)</p>
<p>- Sample Wedding Albums to show customers ($400)</p>
<p>- Our ultimate Goal, an amazing Video Camera ($2500)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Altogether this is over $2,600, but we figure we can scrounge up some of it ourselves offering street dances and yodeling telegrams. (Or we could get overfunded to spare our dignity!)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In return for funding us, we are offering awesome perks and thanks yous! Pens, posters, street dances and yodeling telegrams! And more! We cannot offer anything spectacular, but hope a little touch of our personality will be enough.</p>
<p>We promise frequent updates of events, new photography and fun! We'll keep you in the loop with everything that goes on with Frame of Mind. </p>
<p> </p>

<p>We want to make a living doing what we love, and making other people happy. Your contribution will help us with our dream. We live in a small area where there aren't many video and photography options. We want to offer high quality, memorable services at anaffordable price.

<h3>A Little About Us</h3>
<p>Paradox Pewter has gradually morphed from an absorbing hobby to a full-blown company during the past 12 years, producing an eclectic variety of pins, wax seals and charms.<br/><br/>Recently, Paradox Pewter has had a rapid growth spurt – engaging such clients as Burning Man (Lamplighter's charms) and Children's Fairyland in Oakland, CA (pewter and gold storybox keys).<br/><br/>To meet the demands of this growth, I have gathered and created new equipment, including hand-crafting a spin caster. The time has come, however, where a piece of equipment is needed that I cannot build myself.<br/><br/><strong><em>A laser engraver system.<br/><br/></em></strong>Outsourcing the engraving work, from which the casting molds are made, has quickly become time-consuming and too expensive per piece. Having a system in house will allow me to produce a larger array of products and reduce the cost to customers.

</ul><p><strong>ABOUT CASA ATABEXA ACHE</strong></p>
<p> The Bronx has been, and continues to be, the most underserved of any borough in this city, ranked the unhealthies of 62 counties of New York City.  Casa Atabex Aché has responded consistently to the needs of young and adult women who have been victims of rape, child abuse, addiction, domestic violence, trauma and poverty. Casa Atabex Aché has created a space for women’s self healing through mental, emotional counseling, peer education, emotional release, empowerment programs and seasonal retreats.  Preventive services include  violence prevention and reproducitve justice (HIV/AIDS testing and education, safe sex education and services, Hepatitis C education and workshops, and nutritional education).  Casa Atabex Aché also provides a space for political education, community leadership, and cultural/spiritual events that have been presented on a national level.  Casa Atabex Aché has developed tenant workshops, interdisciplinary arts programming, political advocacy in collaboration with community organizations internationally.   Casa Atabex Aché is a sacred space for women within our communities who want to heal, grow, thrive, and simultaneously, create positive change in thier famlies, community and the world.</p>
<p><strong>Our Commitment to THE SOUTH BRONX</strong></p>
<p>The Bronx community, particularly the South Bronx, is undergoing a shift in population.  The current residents are being displaced and replaced by gentrification, based on the interest of the owners and property management companies to achieve higher income for the housing units, after renovations.  We are clear that this is bigger than us and it is an economic and racial injustice affecting communities nationally and globally.</p>
<p>We, along with our fellow community organizations, have worked continuously to rehabilitate the Bronx and are alarmed and outraged by this situation.   Our goal has always been to empower our communities, and place them at the forefront of their communities revitalization. "" There are over 17,000 public housing residents live in five NYCHA developments across 84 buildings in Mott Haven constantly facing high crime rates, low performing schools, and poor health of residents"".These residents are our constiuents, our participants, our staff and our family and we are committed to continue to provide programs that will build a stronger, more sustainable community that will address their immediate needs. </p>
<p>The repetitive displacement of community organizations via evictions,  contracts or lease renewals denied, or increase in rents have a direct impact on the services offered by community to the community.  In the last year the South Bronx lost over 10 organizations that include La Pena, Rebel Diaz Arts Collective, Freedom, Cescoc, Green Workers Coop, and many others who have lost their premises in this manner.</p>
<p><strong>OUR REQUEST</strong></p>
<p>The community of the South Bronx cannot afford to lose yet another life, another resource or another safe space. We need your support to strategize on next steps and save the space. </p>
<p>We  are making an appeal to you, as our community and family, to address this outrage and help Casa Atabex Aché to continue providing the services vital to our community. </p>
<p>In the next month we are asking you to support our global fundraising efforts to raise $50k towards a NEW SPACE, towards our REBIRTH! </p>
<p>the best thing is that the minute you support, no matter what you give, whereever we are you will be gifted a safe space towards your own healing adn liberation, self empowerment and self love!   </p>
<p>While we have faith that we will exceed our goal, we wont stop until we do and  we will use what eer money is raised to secure a space and continue programming. </p>

<p><b>
</b></p><p><b>Ten years ago, </b>a
group of us got together to re-think how we provided homeless services in
Alachua County. The way we had been doing things wasn’t working. Getting help
was like running an obstacle course. We were asking people with little or no
access to transportation to run back and forth across town, from one agency to
another, desperately trying to stitch together the resources and referrals they needed to pull themselves back on their feet. The same problems that
contributed to people <i>becoming</i> homeless
– limited transportation, lack of knowledge about available help, physical and
mental health problems, and more – also made it difficult for people to
get back <i>into </i>housing. </p>
<p>Community leaders,
advocates, volunteers, and homeless and formerly homeless people spent six
months working on the issue. GRACE Marketplace emerged from these discussions as the
central piece of our community’s 10-Year Plan to End Homelessness. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">GRACE brings together the
best social service and health care agencies in our community to strengthen the
safety net for our friends and neighbors.</span></p><b>

<p><br/></p></div>","Ten years ago, a
group of us got together to re-think how we provided homeless services in
Alachua County. The way we had been doing things wasn’t working. Getting help
was like running an obstacle course. We were asking people with little or no
access to transportation to run back and forth across town, from one agency to
another, desperately trying to stitch together the resources and referrals they needed to pull themselves back on their feet. The same problems that
contributed to people becoming homeless
– limited transportation, lack of knowledge about available help, physical and
mental health problems, and more – also made it difficult for people to
get back into housing. 
Community leaders,
advocates, volunteers, and homeless and formerly homeless people spent six
months working on the issue. GRACE Marketplace emerged from these discussions as the
central piece of our community’s 10-Year Plan to End Homelessness. GRACE brings together the
best social service and health care agencies in our community to strengthen the
safety net for our friends and neighbors.

<h3><b>Living on The Streets for The Cause  </b></h3>
<p>Pastor Dave Ferrari will live homeless for 4 days and 3 nights at the downtown camp named #SafePark, as well as other areas of the city, to raise the necessary funds to reopen the shelter for a year. Video documented by professional photographer Patrick McArdle and guided by #SafePark founder and homeless advocate Jon McLane, Pastor Dave will survive 4 days with no money and only the property he can carry on his back. He will attempt to receive all of his meals, showers, clothing, and hygiene items from the different homeless service organizations, who currently provide these services to the homeless. As well as fundraising to reopen the shelter, Pastor Dave is hoping to bring awareness to the growing needs of the Tucson homeless population. <br/></p>

</div></div>","Following the controversial closing of the church's City of Tucson funded 90 day emergency shelter, Pastor Dave Ferrari has announced a new plan to reopen the low demand shelter year round.  The emergency shelter is set to re-open on Sunday evening July 26, 2015.  Over the next 5 weeks Pastor Dave will be working with civic leaders, business leaders, religious and faith based leaders, as well as citizens and neighbors to solve the issues and get this shelter funded and off the ground.
Living on The Streets for The Cause  
Pastor Dave Ferrari will live homeless for 4 days and 3 nights at the downtown camp named #SafePark, as well as other areas of the city, to raise the necessary funds to reopen the shelter for a year. Video documented by professional photographer Patrick McArdle and guided by #SafePark founder and homeless advocate Jon McLane, Pastor Dave will survive 4 days with no money and only the property he can carry on his back. He will attempt to receive all of his meals, showers, clothing, and hygiene items from the different homeless service organizations, who currently provide these services to the homeless. As well as fundraising to reopen the shelter, Pastor Dave is hoping to bring awareness to the growing needs of the Tucson homeless population.

<p>Ashley Linder, a former foster child and now CrossFit
coach and athlete, started LinderKids with the desire to improve the lives of
eligible foster youth through fitness and community support. She was removed from an abusive home and spent her formative years in foster care. Within this situation, she was unable to participate in physical activities or benefit from the therapeutic team building dynamic of sports and fitness; undoubtedly one of the best opportunities during this crucial developmental period. While in the Navy she discovered an amazing functional fitness protocol and sport called CrossFit. She fell in love with the positive community culture and the constant continued self-improvements experienced due to hard work and dedication. Thus the idea was planted in her heart to start a foundation that afforded foster children the opportunities she never had and to experience the awesomeness of CrossFit.</p>

<p>Foster children are often robbed the opportunity to participate in sports due to lack of funding, no parental support, or are moved from family to family so often they can't consistently be involved in extracurricular activities. This is where LinderKids comes into action and bridges this unfortunate underprivileged inequality.</p>

<p>Lauren, her husband Jonas and her two sons live in Babylon on the south shore of Long Island.  As you may have heard, Long Island's south shore took a devastating hit by Hurricane Sandy.  Luckily they had evacuated prior to the storm and were safe, but when they returned they found their home in a state of disrepair.  Over three feet of water flooded the entire house, front to back. </p>

<h3>BIG Plans for the FUTURE...</h3>
We do have BIG plans for longer term development of our company, that involve expansion, and a new building to accommodate the growth.  We don't want to call it a ""manufacturing facility"", but rather a design studio for all of our artists to have space for creativity.  Our plan includes building a self- contained and self- supported, environmentally friendly facility.  We have researched the use of solar energy, to power the equipment that we use, and we already use green products in our home and to produce our products.  We have the land right here in our small town, but in order to build what we want and NEED, it would cost over $30K.... SO we will start a bit smaller with this fundraising campaign, to get the materials and supplies that we need, to ignite our PLAN!<br/><br/><img alt=""Greg assembly"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1267.photobucket.com/albums/jj551/mleefipps/197debea.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 5px;"" title=""Greg assembly""/>Over the last 5 years, Waste Not Recycled Art has grown incredibly!  In our first year we had 83 sales- and it was JUST ME.  I was so excited to have about 200 blocks to make at Christmas time.  This past Christmas we made over 4000 blocks plus hundreds of other items that we've added since we first set up shop.  My husband and I have now partnered up, we have 2 employees &amp; 7 sales reps.<br/><br/>Although we would LOVE to go paper free, the cost to do that would be astronomical.  We have every intention of combining the recycling aspect of our business with innovation to grow in an eco-friendly way, and will NEVER send our products over-seas to save money on manufacturing.<br/><br/><br/>

JUST KIDDING!  Although great ideas and our catalog WERE born on the balcony while we were on our honeymoon last year!  ;)  Anything above and beyond this amount, will be put to good use, and will get us even closer to our long term goals... so THANK YOU from the bottom of our hearts!<br/><br/></p>

<p>Im looking to open my own design studio to create the best cuts, color, updos and blowouts of your dreams! With the completion of my space it will have the ambiance of elegance with chandeliers over every station and touches of old hollywood glam, each station will have the privateness of sheer curtains to bring down during your color process, from our exclusive color bar.  The shampoo room will be a separate retreat to enjoy a relaxing shampoo and head massage in a dim lit room by sparkling chandeliers above with the soft sounds of spa music in the background in a relaxing lounge chair to put your feet up and enjoy! All while you sip on a little champagne!</p>
<p>And  for the Guys a tribute to back in the day old school barber shop complete with pool table, overstuffed leather couch and vintage inspired barber chair and sink.  Large flat screen TV and Wall Street ticker (just to keep you up to date)! Get that amazing clean shave the only way it should be done, hot towel treatment and all! Even cigars available to enjoy! All in a separate space just for you!</p>
<p>  With this dream come true I can provide what Woodbury has been lacking, an amazing elegant space that meets rugged charm for men and woman alike.  It being the main route to and from for new yorkers to all the best antique shops in the country! Equidistant from Boston and New York, and Washington Depot and Litchfield right up the street, it will bring people from all over, giving support to all our little mom and pop shops Woodbury has to offer!</p>
<p>  I also am wanting to donate a portion of my proceeds to the Susan G. Koman foundation, and St.Jude Research Hospital, two charity's very close to my heart.  This is just something I am wanting to do for the woman and children out there that have suffered from this disease and lost their hair, and a contribution to those that are very close to me that have made it through! </p>
<p>   Without your help none of my dreams can come true, none of the donations, nothing! It's impossible to get a loan these days without being in business for years prior or putting up my parents house :( So make this happen, I NEED ALL of YOU to pitch in whatever you can PLEASE!! Or there will be ALOT of unhappy people looking for SWAG.  All donations can and will be put towards the equipment of the salon even if I don't reach my goal. </p>
<p>All the old world charm and ambiance of Woodbury, and all the talent of a Great stylist and her team! With all of YOUR help and confidence in me  I can make make this dream a reality! Even if you can't contribute monitarily you can do so by getting the word out there for me!!!</p>

</p><h3>What is My Plane Space?</h3>
<p>A patent-pending lightweight, portable carry-on that fits right on top of the existing armrests of planes.  It securely fits on armrests of all plane sizes and is just the right height to keep the person sitting next to you from elbowing you and crowding your space.  It will be your new ""can't fly without"" product!</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><h3>What is the story behind this?</h3>
<p>We are frequent fliers and were tired of always being elbowed by the person sitting in the middle seat.  It is common courtesy to give the middle seat occupant use of both armrests; but everyone has encountered the experience of their seatmate's arms and/or elbows coming across the armrest and jabbing you.  We saw a need - and invented a product to fill that need!  Keep your seat space (and sanity) with My Plane Space.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><h3>What will the money be used for?</h3>
<p>We are ready to move this product into mass production using plastic injection molding.  We are committed to keeping production in the United States. After we receive enough pre-orders through indiegogo.com, we will immediately begin production and get you a My Plane Space as quickly as possible. </p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><h3>Have you tested this product?</h3>
<p>Yes, My Plane Space has received rave reviews!  It has been tested on many flights, regionally and cross-country.  It is a lifesaver!  You no longer have to dread who sits next to you, or receive accidental elbow jabs while your seatmate reads or works on their laptop.  We have received much interest from people when they see it and they always want to know where they can buy one.  The people in the middle seat say it's more comfortable than the regular armrest and it's nice not to get in each other's space. </p>
<h3>Do airlines allow this on board?</h3>
<p>Yes, we worked with the FAA to ensure it meets all requirements.  It easily fits in any carry-on bag (doesn't take up very much space at all) and flight attendants have provided unsolicited feedback that it's such a great idea!  It doesn't block any exits or obscure any functions, so there's no problems at all!  You can use it on any flight!</p>
<h3>Do I still have an armrest?</h3>
<p>Yes, you still have an armrest to use.  You don't have to fight over the middle armrest with a My Plane Space - you graciously give use of the middle armrest to the person sitting next to you.  Which, like many other people, we always give the person in the middle seat the armrest anyway because there's still another one and we all know it sucks to be stuck in the middle.  My Plane Space is actually praised by people sitting in the middle seat as the part that fits over the armrest is padded (much more comfortable than the standard hard armrest).  So, you get to stop the elbows and ride in comfort without it being an uncomfortable or tense situation!</p>
<h3>What if I don't fly, can I still help?</h3>
<p>Yes, even if you don't fly and are not able to donate, it would be greatly appreciated if you could share this campaign with everyone you know.  With 4 million people flying every day, it is likely your co-workers, friends, and/or family use air travel and would love to have a My Plane Space.</p>
<h3>We appreciate your support in revolutionizing airline travel with My Plane Space! </h3>

We are hoping to raise enough money to help build two classrooms on to a local school and to volunteer in an ever growing orphanage! We are also going to be working first hand with the families of the Genocide victims. This will be an amazing and life changing experience for all. Here is a link to our fund raising page, every penny counts and any extra we make goes towards the rest of the build ;) thank you so much xx History - “Rwanda School Aid” was a locally set up charity to send a group of young people and adults from North Berwick to Rwanda in 2009, the group worked hard together to improve a Rwandan community and they helped to build a playground which massively improved the local children’s experience. The group who went to Rwanda came back with a new outlook on life and it was obvious that this opportunity had been a life changing one for many of the British participants, not only did they learn about the Rwandan culture and history, they formed relationships with locals and some of the group members continue to return to Rwanda to continue to support them and their community through improvement.This has been an inspiration to send another youth group to Rwanda in 2012 through North Berwick Youth Cafe. some of these young people may not have otherwise engaged in a project of this scale. • The group will learn team building, planning and some DIY skills • This is a life changing opportunity for all involved • It may open door for return visits • The team will build relationships with one another, staff and the Rwandan community • The list could be endless and these are benefits which we see happening, we do believe that the change in each young person will be the greatest benefit. • And we as an organisation are here to support, give advice, opportunities, invest in our young people, give them ownership of a project and give the chance of a fantastic project to young people who may not otherwise get involved. Benefits to the Rwandan community • Improved living through the improvements we make • Links with British workers and young people • Opportunities for young people to visit Rwanda again if you want to know any more about the project please do not hesitate to contact us. <a href=""http://www.northberwickyouthcafe.org.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.northberwickyouthcafe.org.uk</a> Thank all so much and remember what a difference this will make to this community! xxx</p></div>","Myself and three other Youth Workers are taking a group of Young people to Rwanda in October.

Here is a link to our fund raising page, every penny counts and any extra we make goes towards the rest of the build ;) thank you so much xx History - “Rwanda School Aid” was a locally set up charity to send a group of young people and adults from North Berwick to Rwanda in 2009, the group worked hard together to improve a Rwandan community and they helped to build a playground which massively improved the local children’s experience. The group who went to Rwanda came back with a new outlook on life and it was obvious that this opportunity had been a life changing one for many of the British participants, not only did they learn about the Rwandan culture and history, they formed relationships with locals and some of the group members continue to return to Rwanda to continue to support them and their community through improvement.This has been an inspiration to send another youth group to Rwanda in 2012 through North Berwick Youth Cafe. some of these young people may not have otherwise engaged in a project of this scale. • The group will learn team building, planning and some DIY skills • This is a life changing opportunity for all involved • It may open door for return visits • The team will build relationships with one another, staff and the Rwandan community • The list could be endless and these are benefits which we see happening, we do believe that the change in each young person will be the greatest benefit. • And we as an organisation are here to support, give advice, opportunities, invest in our young people, give them ownership of a project and give the chance of a fantastic project to young people who may not otherwise get involved. Benefits to the Rwandan community • Improved living through the improvements we make • Links with British workers and young people • Opportunities for young people to visit Rwanda again if you want to know any more about the project please do not hesitate to contact us. http://www.northberwickyouthcafe.org.uk Thank all so much and remember what a difference this will make to this community! xxx",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

My brother Spencer and I and our development team have spent almost 3 years
            working full time creating YSAcentral for LDS young and mid-single adults (check out the video above!). It's been our mission
            to unite together LDS singles all over the world and make communication and socializing simple to help keep our hope alive and the fire burning.</p>
<br/><p style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif !important; font-size: 12px !important; color: #4d4d4d !important; line-height: 1.4em !important;"">But <b>we need your help to finish</b> this much needed website. YSAcentral is 90% complete, without your financial contribution and your help spreading the word,
            we'll be forced to stop development and won't be able to launch it.</p>
<br/><p style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif !important; font-size: 12px !important; color: #4d4d4d !important; line-height: 1.4em !important;"">Up to this point, the entire YSAcentral project has been paid for by me personally at great sacrifice. Why?
            Because no YSA website existed that helps LDS singles overcome their unique challenges and I felt very strongly that one needed to be built.
            But sadly, due to conditions outside my control, I can't afford to finish the last 10% of development without your help.
            YSAcentral is an amazing and very robust social platform that requires money and a team of developers.
            If we don't reach our fundraising goal, YSAcentral is not going to happen.</p>
<br/><p style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif !important; font-size: 12px !important; color: #4d4d4d !important; line-height: 1.4em !important;"">This is where you come in and how you can help make it happen for millions of LDS singles like yourself or those singles that you know and love!
            We <b><i>must</i></b> reach our fundraising goal and in order to do so, I need you to do 2 simple but extremely important things: </p>

<h3 style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif !important; font-size: 12px !important; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 7px;"">Keep Our Hope Alive and Our Fire Burning</h3>
<p style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif !important; font-size: 12px !important; color: #4d4d4d !important; line-height: 1.4em !important;"">For us singles, our happiness and our desire to be our best selves is heavily influenced by our social situation and our outlook on our social opportunities.
            Out of all the things that we need as LDS singles, a social network that unites us all together online and offline is by far most needed to help keep
            our hope alive and keep the fire burning within us during this difficult period of our lives (see video).</p>
<br/><h3 style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif !important; font-size: 12px !important; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 7px;"">Loss of Hope Brings Loss of Spirituality</h3>
<p style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif !important; font-size: 12px !important; color: #4d4d4d !important; line-height: 1.4em !important;"">For most YSAs, their greatest desire is to be married. Since marriage and the gospel are so intertwined together, when the hope of finding an ideal eternal
            companion is lost or seems unlikely, faith that once burned brightly now grows dim and their desire to live the gospel begins to fade and some,
            far too often, fall away. When opportunities are limited or non-existent in their own ward, being stuck socializing exclusively within that same
            small group of people month after month causes many to lose hope.</p>
<br/><h3 style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif !important; font-size: 12px !important; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 7px;"">New Opportunities Bring New Hope</h3>
<p style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif !important; font-size: 12px !important; color: #4d4d4d !important; line-height: 1.4em !important;"">Hope of friendship, eternal marriage and a burning desire to live the gospel can be strengthened or restored when YSAs are able to frequently attend social
            activities where they can consistently and easily meet new people, see fresh faces, and have invigorating social interactions with singles from other
            wards in the area. YSAcentral makes this happen by breaking down communication barriers and makes socializing simple.</p>
<br/><h3 style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif !important; font-size: 12px !important; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 7px;"">All YSAs Will Be Included, Involved &amp; Accounted For</h3>
<p style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif !important; font-size: 12px !important; color: #4d4d4d !important; line-height: 1.4em !important;"">YSAs need to be social, to be spiritual, to be united and they need to belong; they need their own unique social network to unite around,
            be empowered and be touched by inspirational and spiritual messages while they are communicating online.
            Priesthood leaders will be more electronically enabled to more effectively serve, connect with, strengthen,
            communicate with and keep track of their young single adults of today.</p>

<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ysacentral.com/refer-donations/api/hit_logger.php"" src="""" style=""display: none;""/></div>","Hi, I'm Josh Hall, the founder of YSAcentral. My brother Spencer and I and our development team have spent almost 3 years
            working full time creating YSAcentral for LDS young and mid-single adults (check out the video above!). It's been our mission
            to unite together LDS singles all over the world and make communication and socializing simple to help keep our hope alive and the fire burning.
But we need your help to finish this much needed website. YSAcentral is 90% complete, without your financial contribution and your help spreading the word,
            we'll be forced to stop development and won't be able to launch it.
Up to this point, the entire YSAcentral project has been paid for by me personally at great sacrifice. Why?
            Because no YSA website existed that helps LDS singles overcome their unique challenges and I felt very strongly that one needed to be built.
            But sadly, due to conditions outside my control, I can't afford to finish the last 10% of development without your help.
            YSAcentral is an amazing and very robust social platform that requires money and a team of developers.
            If we don't reach our fundraising goal, YSAcentral is not going to happen.
This is where you come in and how you can help make it happen for millions of LDS singles like yourself or those singles that you know and love!
            We must reach our fundraising goal and in order to do so, I need you to do 2 simple but extremely important things: 





Keep Our Hope Alive and Our Fire Burning
For us singles, our happiness and our desire to be our best selves is heavily influenced by our social situation and our outlook on our social opportunities.
            Out of all the things that we need as LDS singles, a social network that unites us all together online and offline is by far most needed to help keep
            our hope alive and keep the fire burning within us during this difficult period of our lives (see video).
Loss of Hope Brings Loss of Spirituality
For most YSAs, their greatest desire is to be married. Since marriage and the gospel are so intertwined together, when the hope of finding an ideal eternal
            companion is lost or seems unlikely, faith that once burned brightly now grows dim and their desire to live the gospel begins to fade and some,
            far too often, fall away. When opportunities are limited or non-existent in their own ward, being stuck socializing exclusively within that same
            small group of people month after month causes many to lose hope.
New Opportunities Bring New Hope
Hope of friendship, eternal marriage and a burning desire to live the gospel can be strengthened or restored when YSAs are able to frequently attend social
            activities where they can consistently and easily meet new people, see fresh faces, and have invigorating social interactions with singles from other
            wards in the area. YSAcentral makes this happen by breaking down communication barriers and makes socializing simple.
All YSAs Will Be Included, Involved & Accounted For
YSAs need to be social, to be spiritual, to be united and they need to belong; they need their own unique social network to unite around,
            be empowered and be touched by inspirational and spiritual messages while they are communicating online.
            Priesthood leaders will be more electronically enabled to more effectively serve, connect with, strengthen,
            communicate with and keep track of their young single adults of today.
A Social Network Built for LDS Singles by LDS Singles: Unites Everyone & Everything in One Spot

Being LDS and single, your lifestyle and social needs are very unique and differ greatly from the world's. It's not easy. We know! We're frustrated YSAs too! So we've built a website exclusively for YSAs and what we need:

Every YSA, every activity, every announcement and all the social action within your entire region.
Communication tools, uplifting & entertaining content, helpful info, regional directories, and more.
Accessible anytime, anywhere and always up-to-date. Complete social information in real-time.
No more social barriers. No more social despair. No more being excluded. YSAs are united!
It's all in one spot; from activities to adventures, rides to roommates, hope to humor, dating ideas to making friends, you'll be enhanced personally, strengthened spiritually and enabled temporally.







You will be helping create something that enables, empowers and gives us hope! YSAcentral and MSAcentral, the platform specifically for mid-singles, will bless & enrich the lives of millions of singles for decades to come.
You can join this great cause by clicking the ""contribute"" button now. Whether it's $5 or 5,000, your contribution and efforts in spreading the word will make a huge difference. You will be happy knowing that you personally
            helped create something that makes our lives better and more vibrant. Will you join me and help make it happen for us LDS singles?

                Whether it's biking, basketball, learning to quilt, jogging or joining a service project, every group can be found in one spot. Adventure starts here!






Housing & Roommate Listings
YSAcentral is a real-time, centralized housing & roommate listing service exclusively for LDS YSAs. For those with rooms to rent, they can post their ad anytime with photos & video. For those looking for a room, they can view what's available world-wide in real-time, 24/7.

Facebook Friends Updated Automatically

<h3>Our Story </h3>
<p>My name is Forrest Galante. Exploring and traveling the world has been a
 big part of my life and is one of my greatest passions. Growing up in 
Harare, Zimbabwe, I spent time exploring the depths of the African 
safari. Furthering my interests in the outdoors and primitive survival 
in my studies I have traveled to over 36 countries. I even stripped down
 to my skinnies to become a competitor on Discovery Channel's hit show, <a href=""http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/naked-and-afraid/bios/forrest-galante.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Naked and Afraid""</a> last fall.<br/><br/>I
 believe travel provides an opportunity to open yourself up to new ideas
 and to let go of your culinary inhibitions. From my experiences, I wanted to provide other 
explorers like myself with a resource based on their location anywhere in the world. A place where they 
could share their dining experiences  and provide their thoughts to 
better prepare others.</p>
<p>The entire TravelGrub team has worked tirelessly to get to where we are now. As a labor of love for this project, everyone has worked for free and completely out of pocket to help people all over the world have amazing culinary experiences. By donating to the campaign, you will show us that you believe in our product as well and that you want to help share the love of exotic and exciting food.<br/></p>
<p>The biggest challenge when starting any business like this is 
getting the word out there, we believe this concept sells itself, 
but people need to find out about it in order for it grow! So help us get the word out! :)</p>

<div> </div>Power Toothpaste is the world’s first caffeine-infused toothpaste that <b>gives you a rush while you brush</b>, providing a much-needed boost in the first few minutes after waking up. A single tube comes with enough toothpaste for up to 90 brushes.

<div>You'll be purchasing tubes of Power Toothpaste that are 2.5 fl. oz. in size and good for <b>up to 90 brushing sessions</b>! We recommend brushing with slightly larger than a pea-sized amount of Power Toothpaste, which contains about <b>80 mg of caffeine</b>.</div>
<div><p>This <i>Caffeine Informer</i> article has additional details about Power's specifications and caffeine content: <a href=""http://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-content/caffeine-toothpaste"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-content/caffeine-toothpaste</a></p></div>
<div>The ingredients in Power Toothpaste don't deviate much from what you'd normally see in a toothpaste (besides the caffeine, of course): <i>Glycerin, sorbitol, silica, water, caffeine, xylitol, calcium carbonate, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, flavor, titanium dioxide, xanthan gum, menthol, citric acid, sodium citrate, and sodium laurel sulfate</i>.<p> </p>
<p><b>Here's an example of tubes from our first production batch of travel-size tubes. </b>The larger 2.5 fl. oz. tube will look similar to this, but the design will be printed on the tube rather than on a label, with quality similar to that of your typical premium toothpaste. Our tube manufacturing partner has produced tubes for some of the world's largest companies, including Colgate®.</p> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452104871/qfxy5o47d7v1n3isdhbd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>In order to kick this project off, we're selling tubes of Power Toothpaste on Indiegogo for a lower price than they will sell for online in the future.</p>
<p><b>We've finished formulating our toothpaste, signed the manufacturing contracts, and ordered thousands of tubes in advance of this Indiegogo campaign. </b>Our prototype order of thousands of travel-size tubes went off without a hitch. The funds we raise in this campaign will allow us to manufacture our first large production run of full-size tubes of Power Toothpaste. Our campaign goal of $42,500 represents the amount we need to raise in order to place this first large production order, offer our toothpaste at an attractive price, and continue to be able to sell Power Toothpaste to anyone who wants it after this campaign has completed. <b>If we don't reach our goal, you'll get your money back.</b></p>
<p>If we exceed our funding goal, the extra funds will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accelerating our timeline for shipment of Indiegogo perks.</li>
<li>Growing our ability to turn Power Toothpaste into a self-sustaining business, long after the end of this Indiegogo campaign.</li>
<li>Developing additional products focused on both improving personal health and giving people the power they need to accomplish their goals. We already have a nighttime toothpaste in the works, and raising additional funds on Indiegogo will help us bring this idea to fruition!</li>

Our product, Power Toothpaste, is the world’s first toothpaste to contain caffeine. We treat toothpaste with the spirit of innovation seen much more commonly in Silicon Valley and far too rarely in the corporate behemoths of personal care. Toothpaste is a technology product that helps people clean and care for their teeth… but we believe a toothpaste can and should do more. With Power Toothpaste, you get a rush while you brush™.</span></p><p> </p><p>The idea behind Power was birthed by an experience many can relate to. When Founder Dan Meropol went in for his regular dentistry check-up, his dentist told him that his teeth looked great but that he hadn't been flossing enough. Dan had heard this before, but it hadn't stuck. He did some online research, and was surprised to learn from <a href=""http://www.statisticbrain.com/oral-hygiene-statistics/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an ADA study</a> <span>that only half of Americans floss daily, and half of Americans only brush once per day.</span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Dan set out to find a way to get people to take better care of their teeth, and gave his friend Ian a call. Ian had recently been thinking about how terrible he felt in the mornings, and in a stroke of genius suggested a caffeinated toothpaste.</span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">We realized there was a way to both encourage better oral care <i>and</i> solve the problem of morning grogginess. Ian quickly found himself making the very first version of Power Toothpaste in his kitchen.</span></p><p>Ian got to work formulating and perfecting the flavor of Power Toothpaste. Ian and Dan shared the first version of their toothpaste with their friends and family, and it quickly became evident they were on to something. Their friends demanded it and wanted to buy it, but Ian’s kitchen set- up couldn’t grow anywhere close to the demand they were receiving. It became clear that caffeinated toothpaste needed to become a real product, and they took it upon themselves to turn Power Toothpaste into a bonafide business. After a year of hard work, Power Toothpaste is ready to hit the shelves.</p><div> </div><div>

<li>The safety and healthfulness of our toothpaste is our number one priority. We’ve been working with dentists, industry insiders, and expert formulators to ensure the highest quality product. Plus, our toothpaste is made in America, in FDA and CGMP-compliant facilities. We’ve visited our manufacturing partner in person to inspect it and meet with its staff. </li>
<li>If things go as planned, we're going to be mailing out a lot of toothpaste orders. We're working with a fulfillment partner to ship the bulk of the simpler orders from this campaign. We'll be fulfilling the larger and more complex orders by hand, to make sure everyone gets exactly what they ordered.</li>
<li>The production order we place after this campaign will be our biggest yet. As with any large manufacturing project, things can go wrong in unexpected ways. To get ahead of any issues, we ran a smaller production run of travel-size tubes following the same techniques and processes that will be used in our future production batches. We've ironed out the kinks, received great feedback on those tubes (see the press reviews and testimonials above) and are confident that our subsequent, larger orders will run smoothly.</li>
</ul></li></ul>

<h3>I like having coffee, is this going to replace my morning ritual?</h3>
<p>Not necessarily! Most of our friends who regularly drink coffee find they still enjoy their morning cup of joe, but also enjoy getting their day going as soon as soon as they start brushing. Some of them have reported drinking slightly less coffee, and some of our friends who don’t drink coffee regularly have cut down after using Power Toothpaste. So it really depends on you!</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>Power Toothpaste is fortified with caffeine, just like your coffee. When you brush, your tongue and gums absorb the caffeine. You'll find you feel a boost much quicker than from coffee or energy drinks, which absorb through the stomach. You don’t need to swallow, so just brush normally, with the same amount of toothpaste as you normally would.</p>
<h3>Is Power Toothpaste safe to use?</h3>
<p>Absolutely! Caffeine is the only ingredient in Power Toothpaste that you wouldn't find in your standard toothpaste. Each pea-sized amount of Power Toothpaste contains <span>slightly less than the amount of caffeine as in a medium cup of coffee</span>. Of course, if you are very sensitive to caffeine or have a preexisting medical condition, we'd recommend consulting a medical professional before brushing with Power Toothpaste.</p>
<h3>What about nighttime? Do I need a second tube of toothpaste?</h3>
<p>We don’t recommend using Power Toothpaste at night (unless you're trying to stay up), and for now you should use your standard toothpaste. But stay tuned! We are hard at work developing a nighttime version of Power Toothpaste.</p>
<h3>How often can I brush?</h3>
<p>We don't recommend brushing with Power Toothpaste more than three times a day. Use your judgment.</p>
<h3>What does it taste like?</h3>
<p>We formulated Power Toothpaste to taste like most toothpastes on the market, and we ended up with something we think tastes better, mintier, and fresher than the toothpastes we've used before. Check out <a href=""#user_testimonials"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_self"">these testimonials</a> for a closer look!</p>
<div>
<h3>Does Power Toothpaste contain fluoride?</h3>
<div>Power Toothpaste is a fluoride-free toothpaste. We understand that many people out there would prefer a fluoridated toothpaste. We'd like to additionally offer a fluoridated version, but the cost and complexity of manufacturing a fluoridated toothpaste are much higher, and we didn't want to set our campaign goal any higher than it needed to be. If you help us get Power Toothpaste off of the ground, we'll work hard to develop a fluoridated version to compliment our fluoride-free toothpaste.</div>

</div></div>","Thank you to all of our Indiegogo supporters - We're in business! Power Toothpaste is shipping now from www.powertoothpaste.com. Place your order now and get a rush while you brush.
 

The new tubes have been manufactured, and the toothpaste tastes great - not to mention provides a perfect boost. We can't wait to hear what you think! 
 
 
 
Introducing Power Toothpaste™

  
 
 Power Toothpaste is the world’s first caffeine-infused toothpaste that gives you a rush while you brush, providing a much-needed boost in the first few minutes after waking up. A single tube comes with enough toothpaste for up to 90 brushes. Unlike coffee, which takes 30-45 minutes to fully absorb into your system, Power Toothpaste takes effect almost immediately. You'll feel energized and alert before you've even finished brushing.
 
 
 
 
 Mornings suck. Most of us feel like zombies for the first hour of our day. But it doesn't have to be this way. Power Toothpaste eliminates morning grogginess just minutes after waking up.
 


 
Power Toothpaste is more than just a toothpaste. Power Toothpaste is the world's first toothpaste that not only cleans your teeth, but gives you the energy that you need to take on the world, one morning at a time.

 
 
 

 
Traditional oral care products are boring. For most people, oral care is a chore, something they do because they feel they have to. And 50% of Americans don't brush twice a day. Our mission is to turn oral care into something people can get excited about. Brushing your teeth should be an indispensable part of your morning routine.Power Toothpaste doesn't deliver a megablast of caffeine, but provides a subtle buzz, increasing focus and alertness, all without a crash. Regular coffee drinkers who use our toothpaste still enjoy their morning cup of coffee – the difference is they feel great as they are getting ready and don’t find themselves staring anxiously at a coffee machine, waiting for it to slowly finish brewing.
 
 


 Power Toothpaste beats plaque and tartar buildup in the same way as the leading brands. Not to mention that Power Toothpaste whitens your teeth, compared to coffee which stains and darkens. But this toothpaste does more than just give you a minty-clean smile. Power Toothpaste gives you a rush while you brush, whenever you need it most. Brush just after waking up to blast away morning grogginess in minutes. Brush mid-day to relieve yourself of post-lunch drowsiness, or to refocus before that big meeting. Burning the midnight oil? Brush at night to stay energized and on your A-game. 
 

 
 

Sorry Starbucks.
 

One brush with Power Toothpaste gives you the same energy boost as a cup of coffee, and much quicker. The tubes we're selling here on Indiegogo provide up to  90 brushes. That's 90 cups of coffee, and up to $245 saved.

Power Toothpaste Has Been Turbocharging My Mornings!""Power Toothpaste definitely helps... on days I’ve used it, I still drank my cup of coffee but didn’t feel the need to dive for the coffee machine as soon as I turned on my computer. And on weekends, I haven’t even noticed I skipped my coffee if I used the Power Toothpaste first thing in the morning. ""

**Note: Free shipping included with all US orders!** 


See our Perk Details section below for more information about all of these perks.
 
 

You'll be purchasing tubes of Power Toothpaste that are 2.5 fl. oz. in size and good for up to 90 brushing sessions! We recommend brushing with slightly larger than a pea-sized amount of Power Toothpaste, which contains about 80 mg of caffeine.
This Caffeine Informer article has additional details about Power's specifications and caffeine content: http://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-content/caffeine-toothpaste
The ingredients in Power Toothpaste don't deviate much from what you'd normally see in a toothpaste (besides the caffeine, of course): Glycerin, sorbitol, silica, water, caffeine, xylitol, calcium carbonate, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, flavor, titanium dioxide, xanthan gum, menthol, citric acid, sodium citrate, and sodium laurel sulfate. 
Here's an example of tubes from our first production batch of travel-size tubes. The larger 2.5 fl. oz. tube will look similar to this, but the design will be printed on the tube rather than on a label, with quality similar to that of your typical premium toothpaste. Our tube manufacturing partner has produced tubes for some of the world's largest companies, including Colgate®. 
 
 
 

In order to kick this project off, we're selling tubes of Power Toothpaste on Indiegogo for a lower price than they will sell for online in the future.
We've finished formulating our toothpaste, signed the manufacturing contracts, and ordered thousands of tubes in advance of this Indiegogo campaign. Our prototype order of thousands of travel-size tubes went off without a hitch. The funds we raise in this campaign will allow us to manufacture our first large production run of full-size tubes of Power Toothpaste. Our campaign goal of $42,500 represents the amount we need to raise in order to place this first large production order, offer our toothpaste at an attractive price, and continue to be able to sell Power Toothpaste to anyone who wants it after this campaign has completed. If we don't reach our goal, you'll get your money back.
If we exceed our funding goal, the extra funds will go towards:

Accelerating our timeline for shipment of Indiegogo perks.
Growing our ability to turn Power Toothpaste into a self-sustaining business, long after the end of this Indiegogo campaign.
Developing additional products focused on both improving personal health and giving people the power they need to accomplish their goals. We already have a nighttime toothpaste in the works, and raising additional funds on Indiegogo will help us bring this idea to fruition!

  We think of ourselves as a technology startup, but we don't write code or build apps. Our product, Power Toothpaste, is the world’s first toothpaste to contain caffeine. We treat toothpaste with the spirit of innovation seen much more commonly in Silicon Valley and far too rarely in the corporate behemoths of personal care. Toothpaste is a technology product that helps people clean and care for their teeth… but we believe a toothpaste can and should do more. With Power Toothpaste, you get a rush while you brush™. The idea behind Power was birthed by an experience many can relate to. When Founder Dan Meropol went in for his regular dentistry check-up, his dentist told him that his teeth looked great but that he hadn't been flossing enough. Dan had heard this before, but it hadn't stuck. He did some online research, and was surprised to learn from an ADA study that only half of Americans floss daily, and half of Americans only brush once per day.Dan set out to find a way to get people to take better care of their teeth, and gave his friend Ian a call. Ian had recently been thinking about how terrible he felt in the mornings, and in a stroke of genius suggested a caffeinated toothpaste.We realized there was a way to both encourage better oral care and solve the problem of morning grogginess. Ian quickly found himself making the very first version of Power Toothpaste in his kitchen.Ian got to work formulating and perfecting the flavor of Power Toothpaste. Ian and Dan shared the first version of their toothpaste with their friends and family, and it quickly became evident they were on to something. Their friends demanded it and wanted to buy it, but Ian’s kitchen set- up couldn’t grow anywhere close to the demand they were receiving. It became clear that caffeinated toothpaste needed to become a real product, and they took it upon themselves to turn Power Toothpaste into a bonafide business. After a year of hard work, Power Toothpaste is ready to hit the shelves.

We didn’t want to be one of those crowdfunding campaigns that take months and months to ship. Our supporters deserve better. That’s why we’ve put significant time and financial investment behind Power Toothpaste before we ever brought it to Indiegogo.
 

 
 
 
 American oral hygiene is abysmal: 50% of Americans don't brush twice a day. For most people, oral care is a chore, something they do because they feel they have to. Our mission is to make being healthy an exciting and integral part of the morning routine. We want to make brushing your teeth an indispensable part of your morning, something that not only cleans your teeth but gives you the boost you need to take on the day.
80% of the toothpaste sold in the US is produced by two multibillion-dollar conglomerates, which haven't innovated in decades. Traditional oral care is a lackluster experience. The products are boring and unimaginative. We think you deserve better from your toothpaste, and have re-imagined what a toothpaste can be. This is a toothpaste that does more, and helps you do more. A toothpaste that gives you the energy you need to take on your day.
Power Toothpaste is a new kind of toothpaste. A toothpaste for people with big ideas. A toothpaste for dreamers (and deep sleepers). A toothpaste for people who wake up and want to change the world.

The safety and healthfulness of our toothpaste is our number one priority. We’ve been working with dentists, industry insiders, and expert formulators to ensure the highest quality product. Plus, our toothpaste is made in America, in FDA and CGMP-compliant facilities. We’ve visited our manufacturing partner in person to inspect it and meet with its staff. 
If things go as planned, we're going to be mailing out a lot of toothpaste orders. We're working with a fulfillment partner to ship the bulk of the simpler orders from this campaign. We'll be fulfilling the larger and more complex orders by hand, to make sure everyone gets exactly what they ordered.
The production order we place after this campaign will be our biggest yet. As with any large manufacturing project, things can go wrong in unexpected ways. To get ahead of any issues, we ran a smaller production run of travel-size tubes following the same techniques and processes that will be used in our future production batches. We've ironed out the kinks, received great feedback on those tubes (see the press reviews and testimonials above) and are confident that our subsequent, larger orders will run smoothly.

 
 
Here's some of the work we've done with our tube supplier to make sure our tubes are ready to be manufactured and printed:

“Puntos Corazon” is catholic international NGO,

mission is to train and send young volunteers to live for 1 or 2 years in the
center of a deprived area, to be friend of the lonely and isolated people
through a personal one-to-one compassionate approach. They work with the poor,
the most wounded and rejected people in the world. They generate and promote a
“culture of compassion” which affirms the intrinsic value of every person at all
levels of the society through various initiatives in the corporate, political,
scientific and artistic spheres.<br/><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/469000/files/20140329083144-Group.jpg?1396107104"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>We are looking
for 10,000 US dollars. All the money will go directly in the ONG Puntos’Corazon
bank account.</p>
<p>We will also
make reports about how the money is used. The urgent need is to finance one
more young volunteer in Valparaiso. The volunteers we currently have are really
not enough and we need to finance repairs on house’s floor in the entrance. The
floor and walls were severely damaged after the earthquake and they haven’t
been able to repair them yet.<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">(7200 USD for
one volunteer (600 USD during 12 months) and 2800 USD to repair the house)</span></p>
<p>All the funds
will go to ONG Puntos Corazon in Valparaiso. If we don’t reach the entire goal we will do the
vital repairs that are urgent ( 2800 USD) 
and we can finance a volunteer but for a 
shorter period.</p>
<p><b>You can get outstanding reward : receive a blessing for your startup or project ! </b></p><p>Father Laurent, head of Puntos Corazon, has asked us how he
could help us because what we do is very useful to them. </p><p>And we had an idea; for

<p>Father Laurent proposed  : </p><p></p><p><i>“ The blessing of offices, shops or factories is
something common in Latin America where the religious sense is strong and very
present among people. Blessing a Start-up and most of all a social Start-up has
a strong meaning. It is recognizing that not everything is in our hand as was
saying Jean-Louis when he commented something about luck. More over, it is
asking god’s help, asking that, as the blessing prayer says, God grants “ His
guidance and support to all </i><i>who
plan and conduct those Start-ups, to help them take the right decisions and

<p>Pierre Le Goff, entrepreneur français de 41 ans : “Je suis diplômé en

depuis 8 ans”.</p>
<p>Jean-Louis Laporte : “J’ai 55 ans, je suis entrepreneur social et
ingénieur. Je suis bénévole dans une association de soutien aux maladies du
cancer. Je suis passionné par tout ce qui peut améliorer le futur de
l’humanité. Je suis venu au Chili pour une durée de 6 mois, pour participer au
programme Start-up Chile et lancer un projet appelé Spotrotter.</p>
<p>Pierre : “La réalisation d’un documentaire sur l’ONG Puntos Corazon (
Points Cœur) m’ a ouvert les yeux sur tout un monde que nous côtoyons et que
pourtant nous ne voyons pas! Tout près de nous des hommes et des femmes
souffrent et luttent juste pour survivre et quelques autres essaient de les
aider et de partager avec eux.  Je ne
pouvais plus me réveiller tous les matins et continuer à vivre comme si je
n’avais rien vu! Les contributeurs doivent donner plus que de l’espoir : ils
doivent apporter une aide concrète à toutes ces personnes confrontées à
l’adversité et aux volontaires qui ont besoin de moyens financiers pour mener à
bien leurs missions. C’est un travail de chaque jour et les personnes vivant
ces difficultés, les enfants en particulier ont besoin d’un soutien constant”. </p>
<p>Jean-Louis : “Pierre m’a présenté l’association Points Coeur et j’ai été
particulièrement touché par les personnes que j’ai rencontrées dans les
bidonvilles de Valparaiso. J’ai fait la connaissance d’un vieux monsieur, Don
Tito, vivant seul sans électricité ni eau courante sur un sol en terre battue.
J’ai également rencontré  un paraplégique
nommé Juan qui ne peut plus se déplacer. Les volontaires donnent toute leur vie
pour ces personnes isolées et quasiment exclues de la société des hommes.
Malheureusement, il manqué des volontaires pour visiter tous ceux qui en auraient
tant besoin”.</p>
<p><b>L’association Puntos
Corazon (Points Cœur) en quelques mots </b></p>
<p>“Puntos Corazon” (Points Coeur) est une ONG international fondée en France
en 1990. La mission de “Puntos Corazon” est de former et d’envoyer de jeunes
volontaires vivre 1 ou 2 ans dans des banlieues défavorisées, et d’apporter
compassion et soutien personnalisé aux plus isolés. Ils œuvrent auprès des
populations les plus pauvres, les plus vulnérables et les plus exclues du
monde. Ils génèrent et répandent une “culture de compassion” qui met en avant
la valeur intrinsèque de chaque personne, grâce à diverses initiatives dans le
monde de l’entreprise, de la politique, des arts et des sciences.</p>
<p><b>Ce dont nous avons
besoin et ce que vous pouvez faire</b></p>
<p>Nous avons besoin de 10,000 US dollars. La totalité de cette somme sera
versée sur le compte bancaire de l’ONG Puntos Corazon.</p>
<p>Nous ferons des comptes rendus sur l’utilisation de ces fonds. </p>
<p>Le besoin le plus urgent est de financer un jeune volontaire de plus à Valparaiso.
Ceux actuellement présents sont en nombre insuffisant. Nous devons également financer
les travaux du sol et les murs de l’entrée de la maison sévèrement endommagés
par les termites et le dernier tremblement de terre. Les travaux n’ont pas pu
être lancés faute de moyens financiers (il faut 600 USD par mois pour un
volontaire soit 7,200 USD pour un an , et 2,800 USD pour les travaux de la
maison).</p>
<p>Si nous n’obtenons pas la totalité de cette somme, nous ferons en priorité
les réparations du bâtiment, car il y a urgence, et nous financerons un
volontaire pour une durée plus courte.</p>
<p><b>Vous pouvez
bénéficier d’une récompense hors du commun : la bénédiction de votre start-up
ou de votre projet !</b></p>
<p>Le père Laurent, responsable de Points Cœur, nous a demandé comment il
pouvait nous aider car ce que nous faisons est vraiment très utile pour
l’association.</p>
<p>Nous avons eu une idée : pour toutes les start-ups, ainsi que pour tous les
porteurs de projets, il est important de partir du bon pied et sous une bonne
étoile. Le père Laurent a donc décidé de donner sa bénédiction à tous ceux qui
le souhaiteront.</p>
<p>Le Père Laurent précise : “Les bénédictions de
magasins, de bureaux ou d’entreprises sont courantes en Amérique Latine où le
sentiment religieux est très présent dans la population. Bénir une start-up et
surtout une start-up à vocation sociale est porteur d’un sens fort. C’est
reconnaître que tout notre destin n’est pas entre nos mains, comme le dit si
bien Jean-Louis lorsqu’il évoque la Chance. Surtout, c’est demander l’aide de
Dieu, et comme le dit le texte de la bénédiction c’est demander “qu’il guide
ceux qui dirigent  ces start-ups, les
aide à prendre les bonnes décisions et à se comporter de manière équitable.
Ainsi, en respectant les principes de justice et charité, ces entrepreneurs
auront la conscience de travailler pour le bien commun et le bonheur de
contribuer au progrès de l’humanité.”</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>L’impact</b></p>
<p>Aider cette ONG en rendant la maison d’accueil dans un état décent et en
finançant la mission d’un volontaire supplémentaire est la meilleure manière
d’apporter une aide concrète sur le terrain, et d’être à leurs côtés. </p>
<p><b>Les autres manières
d’apporter son aide</b></p>
<p>Certains ne peuvent pas contribuer financièrement, mais ils peuvent
cependant apporter leur aide :</p>

cette campagne.</p>

<p>Pierre :

otros tratan de ayudar y de compartir con ellos. No podía levantarme cada
mañana y seguir viviendo como si no hubiera visto nada! Los colaboradores deben
entregar más que esperanza: deben proporcionar una ayuda concreta a todas estas
personas que se enfrentan a la adversidad y a los voluntarios que necesitan
recursos financieros para llevar a cabo sus misiones. Se trata de un trabajo
diario y las personas que viven estas dificultades, y los niños en particular,
necesitan un apoyo continuo"".</p>
<p>Jean
-Louis: ""Pierre me presentó la Asociación “Puntos Corazón” y me sentí
particularmente conmovido por la gente que conocí en los barrios pobres de
Valparaíso. Conocí a un anciano, Don Tito, que vive solo, sin electricidad ni
agua corriente, en una casa de piso de barro. También conocí a un hombre parapléjico
llamado Juan, que ya no se puede mover. Los voluntarios dan todo para ayudar a
estas personas aisladas y prácticamente excluidos de la sociedad humana. Por
desgracia, faltan voluntarios para visitar a todos aquellos que tienen tanta
necesidad "" .</p>
<p><b>Acerca de Puntos Corazón</b></p>
<p>""Puntos
Corazón"" es una ONG católica fundada en Francia en 1990, se representada
en 23 países. La Misión de Puntos Corazón 
es de formar y enviar jóvenes voluntarios para vivir 1 o 2 años en un
barrio marginado, para compartir con gente aislada  y poder acercarse a ellos con una mirada
desde la compasión. Ellos trabajan con los pobres, con los mas rechazados y
sufridos del mundo. Intentan difundir una ""cultura de compasión "" que
afirma el valor único de cada persona en diferentes ámbitos de la sociedad a
través de múlyiples iniciativas en el mundo empresarial, político, científico, y
artístico . (<a href=""http://chile.puntoscorazon.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://chile.puntoscorazon.org</a> )</p>
<p><b>Lo que necesitamos y lo que Usted puede hacer</b></p>
<p>Necesitamos
10.000 dólares. El importe total se abonará a la cuenta bancaria de la ONG
Puntos Corazón. Realizaremos informes sobre el uso de estos fondos. La
necesidad más urgente es la de financiar un joven voluntario más en Valparaíso.
Los actualmente presentes son escasos. También tenemos que apoyar los arreglos del
suelo y paredes de la entrada de la casa que ha sido muy dañada por las
termitas y el último terremoto. Los trabajos no se pudieron iniciar debido a la
falta de financiamiento (necesidad de 600 dólares mensuales para un voluntario,
es decir 7.200 dólares por año y 2.800 dólares para los trabajos de la casa).</p>
<p>Si no
conseguimos la suma completa, vamos a dar prioridad a la reparación del
edificio, dado que hay urgencia en ello, 
y financiaremos un voluntario por una duración más corta.</p>
<p><b>Usted recibirá un premio fuera de lo común: la
bendición de su Start-up o de su proyecto!</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>El Padre
Laurent, responsable de la Asociación Puntos Corazón, nos preguntó cómo nos podía
ayudar ya que lo que hacíamos era realmente útil para la asociación.</p>
<p>Tuvimos una
idea: para todas las Start-up, así como para todos los titulares de los
proyectos, es importante empezar bien y con una buena estrella. El Padre
Laurent decidió entonces dar su bendición a todos los que lo deseen.</p>
<p>El Padre
Laurent Pavec dice: :<i>  ""Las bendiciones de tiendas, oficinas o
negocios son comunes en América Latina, donde el sentimiento religioso está muy
presente en la gente. Bendecir una Start-up y sobre todo una start-up con
vocación social conlleva un sentido fuerte, importante. Es reconocer que todo
nuestro destino no está en nuestras manos, como lo menciona Jean-Louis cuando
habla de la Suerte. Sobre todo, es pedir la ayuda de Dios y, como dice el texto
de la bendición es pedir ""que EL guíe a los que dirigen estas Start-ups,
que los ayude a tomar las decisiones correctas y a comportarse justamente. Así,
de acuerdo con los principios de la justicia y de la caridad, estos
emprendedores tienen la conciencia de trabajar por el bien común y la felicidad
de contribuir al progreso de la humanidad "".</i></p>
<p><b>El impacto</b></p>
<p>Ayudar a
esta ONG haciendo que la casa de acogida vuelva a tener condiciones decentes y el
poder financiar una misión voluntaria adicional, es la mejor manera de
proporcionar una ayuda concreta y de estar a su lado.</p>
<p><b>Otras formas de ayudar</b></p>
<p>Algunos no
pueden contribuir financieramente, no obstante pueden brindar asistencia:
pidiendo a su alrededor el poder difundir este mensaje y de dar a conocer esta campaña
de sensibilización .</p>
<p>Contamos
con ustedes, mil gracias!</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p></div>","Voir Version Française!Leer en Espanol!Short Summary

pouvais plus me réveiller tous les matins et continuer à vivre comme si je
n’avais rien vu! Les contributeurs doivent donner plus que de l’espoir : ils
doivent apporter une aide concrète à toutes ces personnes confrontées à
l’adversité et aux volontaires qui ont besoin de moyens financiers pour mener à
bien leurs missions. C’est un travail de chaque jour et les personnes vivant
ces difficultés, les enfants en particulier ont besoin d’un soutien constant”. 
Jean-Louis : “Pierre m’a présenté l’association Points Coeur et j’ai été
particulièrement touché par les personnes que j’ai rencontrées dans les
bidonvilles de Valparaiso. J’ai fait la connaissance d’un vieux monsieur, Don
Tito, vivant seul sans électricité ni eau courante sur un sol en terre battue.
J’ai également rencontré  un paraplégique
nommé Juan qui ne peut plus se déplacer. Les volontaires donnent toute leur vie
pour ces personnes isolées et quasiment exclues de la société des hommes.
Malheureusement, il manqué des volontaires pour visiter tous ceux qui en auraient
tant besoin”.
L’association Puntos
Corazon (Points Cœur) en quelques mots 
“Puntos Corazon” (Points Coeur) est une ONG international fondée en France
en 1990. La mission de “Puntos Corazon” est de former et d’envoyer de jeunes
volontaires vivre 1 ou 2 ans dans des banlieues défavorisées, et d’apporter
compassion et soutien personnalisé aux plus isolés. Ils œuvrent auprès des
populations les plus pauvres, les plus vulnérables et les plus exclues du
monde. Ils génèrent et répandent une “culture de compassion” qui met en avant
la valeur intrinsèque de chaque personne, grâce à diverses initiatives dans le
monde de l’entreprise, de la politique, des arts et des sciences.
Ce dont nous avons
besoin et ce que vous pouvez faire
Nous avons besoin de 10,000 US dollars. La totalité de cette somme sera
versée sur le compte bancaire de l’ONG Puntos Corazon.
Nous ferons des comptes rendus sur l’utilisation de ces fonds. 
Le besoin le plus urgent est de financer un jeune volontaire de plus à Valparaiso.
Ceux actuellement présents sont en nombre insuffisant. Nous devons également financer
les travaux du sol et les murs de l’entrée de la maison sévèrement endommagés
par les termites et le dernier tremblement de terre. Les travaux n’ont pas pu
être lancés faute de moyens financiers (il faut 600 USD par mois pour un
volontaire soit 7,200 USD pour un an , et 2,800 USD pour les travaux de la
maison).
Si nous n’obtenons pas la totalité de cette somme, nous ferons en priorité
les réparations du bâtiment, car il y a urgence, et nous financerons un
volontaire pour une durée plus courte.
Vous pouvez
bénéficier d’une récompense hors du commun : la bénédiction de votre start-up
ou de votre projet !
Le père Laurent, responsable de Points Cœur, nous a demandé comment il
pouvait nous aider car ce que nous faisons est vraiment très utile pour
l’association.
Nous avons eu une idée : pour toutes les start-ups, ainsi que pour tous les
porteurs de projets, il est important de partir du bon pied et sous une bonne
étoile. Le père Laurent a donc décidé de donner sa bénédiction à tous ceux qui
le souhaiteront.
Le Père Laurent précise : “Les bénédictions de
magasins, de bureaux ou d’entreprises sont courantes en Amérique Latine où le
sentiment religieux est très présent dans la population. Bénir une start-up et
surtout une start-up à vocation sociale est porteur d’un sens fort. C’est
reconnaître que tout notre destin n’est pas entre nos mains, comme le dit si
bien Jean-Louis lorsqu’il évoque la Chance. Surtout, c’est demander l’aide de
Dieu, et comme le dit le texte de la bénédiction c’est demander “qu’il guide
ceux qui dirigent  ces start-ups, les
aide à prendre les bonnes décisions et à se comporter de manière équitable.
Ainsi, en respectant les principes de justice et charité, ces entrepreneurs
auront la conscience de travailler pour le bien commun et le bonheur de
contribuer au progrès de l’humanité.”

L’impact
Aider cette ONG en rendant la maison d’accueil dans un état décent et en
finançant la mission d’un volontaire supplémentaire est la meilleure manière
d’apporter une aide concrète sur le terrain, et d’être à leurs côtés. 
Les autres manières
d’apporter son aide
Certains ne peuvent pas contribuer financièrement, mais ils peuvent
cependant apporter leur aide :
- en demandant autour d’eux de diffuser le message et de faire connaître
cette campagne.
Nous comptons sur vous tous, mille merci !!!Version Espanol:Ayudemos la casa de acogida de “Puntos Corazón”
a luchar contra las termitas y para financiar una misión de voluntarios

Breve
resumen
Este
proyecto es de dos amigos, Pierre y Jean -Louis (y de todo Valparaíso detrás de
ellos !)
Pierre Le
Goff, empresario francés de 41 años: ""Me gradué en cine en la Escuela ESSRA.
También hice una carrera en la industria alimentaria, la industria farmacéutica
y la restauración. Vivo en Chile desde hace 8 años "".
Jean -Louis
Laporte : ""Tengo 55 años, soy ingeniero del área social y empresario. Soy
voluntario en una asociación de apoyo para enfermedades cancerígenas. Soy un
apasionado de todo lo que pueda mejorar el futuro de la humanidad. Llegué a
Chile por un período de seis meses, para participar en el programa Start-Up
Chile y poner en marcha un proyecto llamado Spotrotter.
Pierre :
""La realización de un documental sobre la ONG “Puntos Corazón” me abrió los
ojos hacia un mundo en el cual vivimos pero que sin embargo no vemos! Cerca de
nosotros, existen hombres y mujeres que sufren y luchan para sobrevivir, y
otros tratan de ayudar y de compartir con ellos. No podía levantarme cada
mañana y seguir viviendo como si no hubiera visto nada! Los colaboradores deben
entregar más que esperanza: deben proporcionar una ayuda concreta a todas estas
personas que se enfrentan a la adversidad y a los voluntarios que necesitan
recursos financieros para llevar a cabo sus misiones. Se trata de un trabajo
diario y las personas que viven estas dificultades, y los niños en particular,
necesitan un apoyo continuo"".
Jean
-Louis: ""Pierre me presentó la Asociación “Puntos Corazón” y me sentí
particularmente conmovido por la gente que conocí en los barrios pobres de
Valparaíso. Conocí a un anciano, Don Tito, que vive solo, sin electricidad ni
agua corriente, en una casa de piso de barro. También conocí a un hombre parapléjico
llamado Juan, que ya no se puede mover. Los voluntarios dan todo para ayudar a
estas personas aisladas y prácticamente excluidos de la sociedad humana. Por
desgracia, faltan voluntarios para visitar a todos aquellos que tienen tanta
necesidad "" .
Acerca de Puntos Corazón
""Puntos
Corazón"" es una ONG católica fundada en Francia en 1990, se representada
en 23 países. La Misión de Puntos Corazón 
es de formar y enviar jóvenes voluntarios para vivir 1 o 2 años en un
barrio marginado, para compartir con gente aislada  y poder acercarse a ellos con una mirada
desde la compasión. Ellos trabajan con los pobres, con los mas rechazados y
sufridos del mundo. Intentan difundir una ""cultura de compasión "" que
afirma el valor único de cada persona en diferentes ámbitos de la sociedad a
través de múlyiples iniciativas en el mundo empresarial, político, científico, y
artístico . (http://chile.puntoscorazon.org )
Lo que necesitamos y lo que Usted puede hacer
Necesitamos
10.000 dólares. El importe total se abonará a la cuenta bancaria de la ONG
Puntos Corazón. Realizaremos informes sobre el uso de estos fondos. La
necesidad más urgente es la de financiar un joven voluntario más en Valparaíso.
Los actualmente presentes son escasos. También tenemos que apoyar los arreglos del
suelo y paredes de la entrada de la casa que ha sido muy dañada por las
termitas y el último terremoto. Los trabajos no se pudieron iniciar debido a la
falta de financiamiento (necesidad de 600 dólares mensuales para un voluntario,
es decir 7.200 dólares por año y 2.800 dólares para los trabajos de la casa).
Si no
conseguimos la suma completa, vamos a dar prioridad a la reparación del
edificio, dado que hay urgencia en ello, 
y financiaremos un voluntario por una duración más corta.
Usted recibirá un premio fuera de lo común: la
bendición de su Start-up o de su proyecto!

El Padre
Laurent, responsable de la Asociación Puntos Corazón, nos preguntó cómo nos podía
ayudar ya que lo que hacíamos era realmente útil para la asociación.
Tuvimos una
idea: para todas las Start-up, así como para todos los titulares de los
proyectos, es importante empezar bien y con una buena estrella. El Padre
Laurent decidió entonces dar su bendición a todos los que lo deseen.
El Padre
Laurent Pavec dice: :  ""Las bendiciones de tiendas, oficinas o
negocios son comunes en América Latina, donde el sentimiento religioso está muy
presente en la gente. Bendecir una Start-up y sobre todo una start-up con
vocación social conlleva un sentido fuerte, importante. Es reconocer que todo
nuestro destino no está en nuestras manos, como lo menciona Jean-Louis cuando
habla de la Suerte. Sobre todo, es pedir la ayuda de Dios y, como dice el texto
de la bendición es pedir ""que EL guíe a los que dirigen estas Start-ups,
que los ayude a tomar las decisiones correctas y a comportarse justamente. Así,
de acuerdo con los principios de la justicia y de la caridad, estos
emprendedores tienen la conciencia de trabajar por el bien común y la felicidad
de contribuir al progreso de la humanidad "".
El impacto
Ayudar a
esta ONG haciendo que la casa de acogida vuelva a tener condiciones decentes y el
poder financiar una misión voluntaria adicional, es la mejor manera de
proporcionar una ayuda concreta y de estar a su lado.
Otras formas de ayudar
Algunos no
pueden contribuir financieramente, no obstante pueden brindar asistencia:

<p>At the 25<sup>th</sup> Annual Popsicle Stick
Bridge Competition held at the University of Alberta in 2013, Civil Engineering
Student Tony Dong broke the record of highest weight at an astonishing 746 lbs
(338kg). To put this into perspective, this is the approximate weight of a
Zebra, being held up entirely by white glue and 100 popsicle sticks. However Tony
didn’t stop there, this year he came up with a new and improved design and once
again broke his own record, holding a weight of 970 lbs (440kg). After great
success, it is time to take the bridge building to the next level. Forming a
team of four students all in our final year of study in the Civil Engineering
Co-op Program, we would like to represent the University of Alberta Faculty of
Engineering and Edmonton itself at the 31<sup>st</sup> Annual Troitsky Bridge
Building Competition. </p>The four-day competition is held in Montreal
at the Concordia University from March 5th to March 8<sup>th</sup> 2015. This
is the first time that the University of Alberta has had an opportunity to be
involved in the event. The University of Calgary has been very active and has teams of toughly 30 people this year! As this is our first year of involvement, our
Engineering Student Society budget is limited and finding funding for materials
and to attend the event is a challenge. Events such as this promote
engineering, creativity, and teamwork. We want to kick start The University of
Alberta’s involvement, hopefully leading to many more years of record breaking
popsicle stick bridges, but we need your help! 
The $5000 will cover the building materials for the bridge,

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We are currently students at the University of Waterloo who strongly believe that a world where we can enjoy the pleasures of modern life and keep our environment clean at the same time, is within our reach.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>A few years ago, Ma'in Sinan, an automotive engineer living in London, Ontario invented a technology for capturing and storing the CO2 emissions of cars, trucks, and buses. The beauty of this technology is that it can be built into both new and existing vehicles; into your new car, and into the car you drove today - meaning it can dramatically reduce the pollution from the cars already on the road. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The dream is to get this technology on as many cars, trucks and buses as possible. The captured vehicle CO2 can then be recycled into biofuels, fertilizers, plastics and even nutritional products with algae technologies. With transportation producing one quarter of the world's CO2 emissions, the potential environmental benefits of this technology are staggering.<br/></p>
<div><br/></div>
<p></p>
<p>Our goal is to build a better showcase for this technology, to both get the word out about this technology and to attract the investments needed to get it on the road. We will be building a new unit of the VCCT and installing it on a car, which we will use to better showcase this technology and it's vast potential. With your support, we can take this next big in making our transportation carbon neutral. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;"">The Impact</span><br/></p>
</div><div>
<p>There is over 800 million vehicles on the roads today. As the world transitions to carbon neutral vehicles, we still need to reduce the environmental impact of these vehicles already on the road; the VCCT can do just that. By helping attract investments for, this project will get us a big step closer to putting this game-changing technology.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Ultimately this project is about making a showcase that demonstrates the true potential of this technology. We will be buying a cheap used car, for around $2000, exactly the kind of car that is so common on the road, and exactly the sort of car that our system will be making carbon neutral. We will then build several models of the VCCT and monitoring the performance of the car with these systems over long periods of time, to demonstrate that a car's performance is unaffected by the VCCT.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The money will also go to buying the parts for the different models and the cost of fuel for the the long range tests. Also, while we as a team will be capable of building most of the system ourselves, there will be several delicate machining jobs which we will need to pay for for these models. These efforts should make it possible for us to optimize the manufacturing process for cheap mass production.</p>

our leading contender for dealing with the captured CO2 is algae,
where the captured CO2 is emptied from the vehicle and recycled with
an algae culture. CO2 can be used in the process of growing algae,
wherein useful products can be derived from the resulting algae
biomass; this includes biofuels, fertilizers, highly nutritious
animal feed and cosmetic products. Research and development in the
use of algae cultures, whether in open ponds or photobioreactors, for
recycling CO2 has been going on for decades; we want to make use of
the many advances made in this CO2 recycling technique. We are also
exploring different chemical processes that have been developed for
dealing with CO2 in a safe non-corrosive way.</span></p>

an interesting side note, we expect that this technology will have
similar affects as a turbo charger - increasing the engine's
volumetric efficiency, albeit arriving at that affect in a totally
different way. The reason for this is that the act of pumping exhaust
gases out of the engine will reduce the residual exhaust gases that
are known to remain in the engine's cylinders after a given
cylinder's expansion stroke and into that cylinder's next intake of a
fuel-air mixture, reducing the resulting heating and expansion of the
intake fuel-air mixture and thus theoretically increasing the
engine's volumetric efficiency. This project will also allow us to
measure this phenomenon in detail.</span></p>

all gases are being captured. We are exploring different filtration
technologies so that in the future only the most harmful gases
(including CO2 of course) are captured, allowing for more efficient
storage. Metal organic frameworks are a good example of this;
research has shown that metal organic frameworks can be used for both
filtering CO2 from exhaust containing other gases such as CO and CH4
and for storing the filtered CO2 in a highly efficient manner.</span></p>

vision is that the VCCT will work a long side leading clean
transportation technologies, for an even cleaner earth. Even if every
vehicle manufactured tomorrow onwards were completely emissions free
(which would be fantastic), the nearly one billion cars, trucks and
buses on today's roads would still be there for years, emitting and
polluting. This technology makes it possible to make vehicles carbon
neutral well after they have left the assembly line. Also, the
current reality is that there will be significantly more emissions
emitting vehicles produced than emission free vehicles in the near
future, and the VCCT will be the best way to address those vehicles.</span></span></p>

Our Story

We are currently students at the University of Waterloo who strongly believe that a world where we can enjoy the pleasures of modern life and keep our environment clean at the same time, is within our reach.

A few years ago, Ma'in Sinan, an automotive engineer living in London, Ontario invented a technology for capturing and storing the CO2 emissions of cars, trucks, and buses. The beauty of this technology is that it can be built into both new and existing vehicles; into your new car, and into the car you drove today - meaning it can dramatically reduce the pollution from the cars already on the road. 

The dream is to get this technology on as many cars, trucks and buses as possible. The captured vehicle CO2 can then be recycled into biofuels, fertilizers, plastics and even nutritional products with algae technologies. With transportation producing one quarter of the world's CO2 emissions, the potential environmental benefits of this technology are staggering.


Our goal is to build a better showcase for this technology, to both get the word out about this technology and to attract the investments needed to get it on the road. We will be building a new unit of the VCCT and installing it on a car, which we will use to better showcase this technology and it's vast potential. With your support, we can take this next big in making our transportation carbon neutral. 

The Impact

There is over 800 million vehicles on the roads today. As the world transitions to carbon neutral vehicles, we still need to reduce the environmental impact of these vehicles already on the road; the VCCT can do just that. By helping attract investments for, this project will get us a big step closer to putting this game-changing technology.


What We Need & What You Get
Ultimately this project is about making a showcase that demonstrates the true potential of this technology. We will be buying a cheap used car, for around $2000, exactly the kind of car that is so common on the road, and exactly the sort of car that our system will be making carbon neutral. We will then build several models of the VCCT and monitoring the performance of the car with these systems over long periods of time, to demonstrate that a car's performance is unaffected by the VCCT.

The money will also go to buying the parts for the different models and the cost of fuel for the the long range tests. Also, while we as a team will be capable of building most of the system ourselves, there will be several delicate machining jobs which we will need to pay for for these models. These efforts should make it possible for us to optimize the manufacturing process for cheap mass production.

FAQs


What
happens to the stored CO2?

Currently,
our leading contender for dealing with the captured CO2 is algae,
where the captured CO2 is emptied from the vehicle and recycled with
an algae culture. CO2 can be used in the process of growing algae,
wherein useful products can be derived from the resulting algae
biomass; this includes biofuels, fertilizers, highly nutritious
animal feed and cosmetic products. Research and development in the
use of algae cultures, whether in open ponds or photobioreactors, for
recycling CO2 has been going on for decades; we want to make use of
the many advances made in this CO2 recycling technique. We are also
exploring different chemical processes that have been developed for
dealing with CO2 in a safe non-corrosive way.

What
happens if the exhaust storage is full?

When
the exhaust storage is full, the vehicle will simply begin emitting
it's exhaust gases into the air as it would without the technology,
until the storage unit is emptied again. 


What
are the effects on the fuel efficiency of a vehicle using this carbon
capture system?

Our
calculations indicate that the effects will be minimal; one of the
benefits of this  project is that it will allow us to confirm such
effects in detail. 


As
an interesting side note, we expect that this technology will have
similar affects as a turbo charger - increasing the engine's
volumetric efficiency, albeit arriving at that affect in a totally
different way. The reason for this is that the act of pumping exhaust
gases out of the engine will reduce the residual exhaust gases that
are known to remain in the engine's cylinders after a given
cylinder's expansion stroke and into that cylinder's next intake of a
fuel-air mixture, reducing the resulting heating and expansion of the
intake fuel-air mixture and thus theoretically increasing the
engine's volumetric efficiency. This project will also allow us to
measure this phenomenon in detail.

There
is more than just CO2 in exhaust gases, what happens to the non-CO2
gases? 


Currently,
all gases are being captured. We are exploring different filtration
technologies so that in the future only the most harmful gases
(including CO2 of course) are captured, allowing for more efficient
storage. Metal organic frameworks are a good example of this;
research has shown that metal organic frameworks can be used for both
filtering CO2 from exhaust containing other gases such as CO and CH4
and for storing the filtered CO2 in a highly efficient manner.


Why not just focus on
developing electric vehicles and/or fuel cell powered vehicles?

The
vision is that the VCCT will work a long side leading clean
transportation technologies, for an even cleaner earth. Even if every
vehicle manufactured tomorrow onwards were completely emissions free
(which would be fantastic), the nearly one billion cars, trucks and
buses on today's roads would still be there for years, emitting and
polluting. This technology makes it possible to make vehicles carbon
neutral well after they have left the assembly line. Also, the
current reality is that there will be significantly more emissions
emitting vehicles produced than emission free vehicles in the near
future, and the VCCT will be the best way to address those vehicles.

To get this technology on the road, wouldn't there need to be an infrastructure to handle the CO2? Is that a huge barrier to get this technology out there?Our long term goal is for this technology to be widespread. Our more immediate goal is to get this technology on larger vehicles, such as transport trucks and buses. One great way to start commercializing this technology is with public transit systems. There are two big reasons for this: the first is that these bus lines will now be to offer completely carbon neutral transportation, which will of course increase their ridership, making their investment in this technology worthwhile.

If the storage gets full, they can go back to emitting their CO2 until the trip is complete. This would still significantly reduce carbon emissions.We intend to use the revenue from commercializing this technology on public transport buses and transport trucks to begin funding the infrastructure needed for a widespread adoption of this technology.  Wouldn't it be better to simply capture the CO2 of industry (power plants, factories, etc.)?

<p>Street and other community performances have always been a big part of TEN31.  We always say that if it wasn't for our fans we wouldn't even be in existence.</p>
<p>The building we have been in for the past 3 years was recently sold and we are being forced to move.  The move opened up an opportunity for us to take on a bigger space.  More space equals MORE PRETEND!</p>
<p>With this bigger space we will be opening a Non-Profit Healing Arts and Event space in the city of Pawtucket.  The goal of this new space is to provide an arts outlet for anyone and everyone who is interested in making art a part of their lives.  It is important to us that we make art and creativity accessible to all people.  Art and getting in touch with one's creativity is both healing and inspiring. </p>
<p>REVEL factory, which is the name of our new space, will offer classes and workshops that are open to the public.  These will range in age and skill level, as well as concentration.  Dance, Theater, Costume Making, Painting - If you can think of it, REVEL factory wants to offer it!  We also want to provide a space for performers and artists to showcase their own work, or for people to host events. </p>
<p>One of the major things REVEL factory is going to do is provide TEN31 a place where we can  have our own events and walk through experiences featuring TEN31 characters and performances.  This is an  opportunity for us to have a permanent location where the people of the community can come and be a part of the magic of TEN31.  </p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The world we live in is full of distractions that take people out of the now.  REVEL factory's goal is to create a place where people can reconnect with themselves and others while exploring their creativity and imagination.  The possibilities are endless.  Each donation provides us with the resources to create these opportunities for the people of our community, and for YOU!</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The end goal for this campaign is $75,000.  This money will go toward the following additions to the space.  The more money we raise, the more of these things we can provide. *</p>
<p>- A Dance and Performance Floor - $13,500</p>
<p>-Theatrical Lighting - $7,482</p>
<p>- Curtains for the stage/Pipe and Drape System - $5,367</p>
<p>- Decorative light fixtures for events - (TBD based on funds raised and money allocated to this)</p>
<p>- A Sound System - $12,110</p>
<p>- Tables, Chairs, and Basic Linens -  30 tables = $4500, 300 Chairs = $9000, Total for all = $13,500</p>
<p>- Workshop Supplies (price TBD based on workshops, we hope to start with a stocked supply closet and go from there!)</p>
<p>- Moveable Walls that will reshape the space and provide a place for artwork to be displayed - (TBD based on funds raised and money allocated to this)</p>
<p>Estimated total with all given prices: $51,959 plus expenses for taxes, indiegogo processing fees, perk shipping, and the remainder will go towards the additions listed above!</p>
<p> *If the full amount is not raised we will spend what we raise to get the basics for the space, and hopefully be able to add more over the years.  <br/></p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> When opening up a new space, there are of course obstacles that may arise.  We have taken the time to map out the plan for the new space and what we can offer.  We also know that if this campaign is not as successful as we hope it to be, that we need to start small. </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary TEN31 is a Living Art Company based in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.  The company was started when Co-Owners Eric and Joe created Living Gargoyles that performed at WaterFire in downtown Providence.  From the success of those performances TEN31 grew into much more.  We have been performing at Special Events for the past 16 years.  Our characters travel to many different parts of the country, and have even been outside the United States to perform at these events.  Our slogan is ""we make pretend"".  
Street and other community performances have always been a big part of TEN31.  We always say that if it wasn't for our fans we wouldn't even be in existence.
The building we have been in for the past 3 years was recently sold and we are being forced to move.  The move opened up an opportunity for us to take on a bigger space.  More space equals MORE PRETEND!
With this bigger space we will be opening a Non-Profit Healing Arts and Event space in the city of Pawtucket.  The goal of this new space is to provide an arts outlet for anyone and everyone who is interested in making art a part of their lives.  It is important to us that we make art and creativity accessible to all people.  Art and getting in touch with one's creativity is both healing and inspiring. 
REVEL factory, which is the name of our new space, will offer classes and workshops that are open to the public.  These will range in age and skill level, as well as concentration.  Dance, Theater, Costume Making, Painting - If you can think of it, REVEL factory wants to offer it!  We also want to provide a space for performers and artists to showcase their own work, or for people to host events. 
One of the major things REVEL factory is going to do is provide TEN31 a place where we can  have our own events and walk through experiences featuring TEN31 characters and performances.  This is an  opportunity for us to have a permanent location where the people of the community can come and be a part of the magic of TEN31.  

The Impact
The world we live in is full of distractions that take people out of the now.  REVEL factory's goal is to create a place where people can reconnect with themselves and others while exploring their creativity and imagination.  The possibilities are endless.  Each donation provides us with the resources to create these opportunities for the people of our community, and for YOU!   What We Need & What You Get The end goal for this campaign is $75,000.  This money will go toward the following additions to the space.  The more money we raise, the more of these things we can provide. *
- A Dance and Performance Floor - $13,500
-Theatrical Lighting - $7,482
- Curtains for the stage/Pipe and Drape System - $5,367
- Decorative light fixtures for events - (TBD based on funds raised and money allocated to this)
- A Sound System - $12,110
- Tables, Chairs, and Basic Linens -  30 tables = $4500, 300 Chairs = $9000, Total for all = $13,500
- Workshop Supplies (price TBD based on workshops, we hope to start with a stocked supply closet and go from there!)
- Moveable Walls that will reshape the space and provide a place for artwork to be displayed - (TBD based on funds raised and money allocated to this)
Estimated total with all given prices: $51,959 plus expenses for taxes, indiegogo processing fees, perk shipping, and the remainder will go towards the additions listed above!
 *If the full amount is not raised we will spend what we raise to get the basics for the space, and hopefully be able to add more over the years.     
    Risks & Challenges  When opening up a new space, there are of course obstacles that may arise.  We have taken the time to map out the plan for the new space and what we can offer.  We also know that if this campaign is not as successful as we hope it to be, that we need to start small. 
NONE of this will stop us from opening REVEL factory!  We are fully prepared to have small scale events and open the space to community projects as it continues to grow.  We also have a plan in place to get REVEL off the ground with a team of Business Students from Roger Williams University this fall.  These students will be given the opportunity to get real world business experience and TEN31 will be provided with people to help us grow and shape our new organization.

This project is not only a passion of ours, it is a reality.  We will do everything in our power to make it work.  Your help will transform this dream into reality and we are so excited to start this journey with you!

<b>Ποίο κάτω θα βρείτε κείμενο στα Ελληνικά.<br/></b></p><p><b>About
Me And This Project: </b>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
My
name is Anna and I live in the small, 500-person village of Zitsa in
the northwest mountains of Greece. I moved here from the United
States (where I had been an environmental lawyer) to be with the love
of my life, and now husband, Kostas (the baker of the village!).  <br/></p><p>Zitsa
is an amazing village for so many reasons, too many to list here (but
if you want to know, ask and I'll respond!). But like many villages
in Greece, over the years much of the ""life"" of the village
has migrated out to the closest city, Ioannina (population about
170,000), which is 25K (15
miles), and as the opportunities in the village have diminished, so
have the number of young people
and families. Zitsa used to have a lot more small businesses and
people did not have to trek
into the city for many basic necessities that were available here,
but are no longer. The journey
into Ioannina is not always easy - many of the older people don't
have cars or can't drive, the
public transportation is infrequent (or unavailable - there are no
buses on weekends), and it takes
a very long time (about an hour each way, whereas by car it's about
25-30 min.). It's also expensive
given the average income in Greece, not to mention the current
crisis. 

</p><p>
</p><p>
I
have lived here a little over 3 years now, and though it has not
always been easy to transition to an entirely new life (and new
language - yeesh!), the wonderful welcome from the incredibly warm
people here has definitely eased the change. I came here because I
fell in love with a person, and then I fell in love with the village.
And because I am passionate about Zitsa and all I believe it can be,
I want to help revitalize it. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
This
is where the bookstore comes in. My passion for my adopted village is
only eclipsed by my passion for all things books - but not just
reading books. I love sharing books, engaging in books through
reading, writing, listening, and sharing. I love teaching, and
learning, and I love the idea of  creating a bookstore around which a
literary community can be built. I want to share my love and passion
for books, for all books, to all people. 

</p><p>
</p><p>
At
the same time, the bookstore will bring some needed services to Zitsa
and the villages around - with this bookstore, people will no longer
have to travel all the way into Ioannina (or further if coming
from a neighboring village) to get books and school supplies. <br/></p><p>Nor
will they have to travel
outside their home village to find and engage in cultural activities.
This bookshop will help
cement Zitsa as a cultural center away from the city as I will have
numerous and continuous events
and seminars, everything from writing and knitting clubs to local
author presentations to international
music and crafts demonstrations (Kostas &amp; I host a LOT of foreign
travelers through
Couchsurfing and many have expressed interest in sharing stories
about their home countries
as well as their talents and passions). It will increase tourism and
also help the immigrant
populations that live here as I will have books in many languages
starting with Greek, English,
and Albanian, and then expanding to German, French, Hebrew and so on,
as I can. 

</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
The
only English school around this area closed here in Zitsa last year,
so I also plan on holding story times for children (and any adults
who want to come, of course) where I will read books to the
kids in Greek (while the kids laugh at my terrible Greek!) and then
read the same book in English.
It may not be structured lessons, but it will be a way for the kids
to learn and engage in the
language. 

</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Finally,
this bookshop will not only sell new and used books, but it will be
one of, if not the ONLY,
bookshop in Greece to rent books - it will be almost like a private
library. And because I want
the villagers to have easy accessibility to books, I will keep the
costs very low. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
This
is why I need some help. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
<b>What
We Need From You: </b>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Kostas
and I have already and will continue to put a lot of our own savings
into this project. 
</p>
<p>
Also,
in Aug. 2013 I was awarded a grant from the EU for young
entrepreneurs to start new businesses in Greece. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
But
our savings, and the grant, are not enough to cover all our start-up
costs. The money we hope
to raise here will pay for: 

</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>
Books,
books, books!! The shelves we have are still mostly empty - right now
the only books
we have are from our personal collections and some donations. With
the money we
raise, we will be able to buy the first shipment of new &amp; used
books to fill the shop, and
then the shop will be self-sustaining as we will use the money from
book sales and rentals
to buy more inventory. 
</li>
<li>
Shelves
&amp; furnishings. The physical space is about 70% complete but we
can't do much more until we receive some funding.</li>
<li>
Events/Seminars/Programs.
Because I want all the villagers to be able to participate in the
various events and programs I will have every few weeks in the
bookshop, I do not want
to charge for attendance. But there will be some costs involved
(materials, financial
assistance to authors and other professionals to travel &amp; stay
here, etc.) and I hope to use funds raised here to cover some of
those costs. 

</li>
</ul><p></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
<b>What
You Will Get From Us: </b>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Undying
gratitude. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Just
kidding - there's more ;) Since you might want something a little
more fun, some of the perks
we have for you are*: 

</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>
Personally
designed Zitsa postcards made from our own photography portfolio 
</li>
<li>
Bookmarks
with the stanzas about Zitsa from Lord Byron's famous poem ""Childe Harold's
Pilgrimage"" written in both English &amp; Greek 

</li>
<li>
Unique
Bookgarden T-shirts with our logo made specifically for this campaign
- after the campaign
ends, they will be discontinued 

</li>
<li>
Bookgarden
book bags with literary quotes in English &amp; Greek and our logo 
</li>
<li>
The
opportunity to name a bookshelf - you can use your own name, or make
up something


</li>
<li>
2-night's
stay at the gorgeous hotel here in Zitsa and 2 days of guided tourism
of the region
by us (airfare not included - but all food &amp; accommodations are
taken care of). 

</li>
<li>
Bakery
Box filled with homemade surprises! 
</li>
</ul><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
<b>Can't
Contribute Financially? Send Books! </b>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Do
you want to help but can't contribute financially? Well, we always
need books. If you have some
you don't want or need anymore, or just want to give away, please
send them to us!! 

</p><p>
Languages
other than English or Greek would be most appreciated, though we will
take anything.
As a thank-you for books you send, you will receive (unless you
indicate that you do not want a perk): 

</p><p>
</p><p>
-
1-3 book = 1 postcard 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
-
4-7 books = 2 postcards 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
-
8-11 books = 2 postcards + 1 bookmark 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
-
12-15 books = 2 postcards, 1 bookmark + 1 t-shirt 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
-
16 books or more = just send money as the shipping to Greece for so
many books could be ridiculous!
But, if you do want to send so many books, you get 2 postcards, 1
bookmark, and 1 book
bag. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
<b>No
Books? Tell A Friend! </b>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Also,
just spreading the word about this campaign would be tremendous help.
Put it on Facebook,
Twitter, and other social media outlets. Put a link on your blog.
Send personal e-mails
to your friends and family. Every bit helps!!! 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

you! </b>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Thank
you so, so much just for reading. If you have any questions or
comments whatsoever, do not
hesitate to contact us at zitsabookgarden@hotmail.com. Thanks again!

μένα και το </b><b>project</b><b>:</b></p>
<p>
Ονομάζομαι
 Άννα Έλλις και ζω σε ένα μικρό χωριό
(500 κατοίκων), τη Ζίτσα στα βορειοδυτικά
βουνά της Ελλάδας. Μετακόμισα εδώ από
τις Ηνωμένες Πολιτείες για να είμαι με
τον έρωτα της ζωής μου, και τώρα σύζυγο
μου, τον Κώστα ( που είναι ο φούρναρης
του χωριού!).</p>
<p>
Η Ζίτσα είναι
ένα εκπληκτικό χωριό για πολλούς λόγους,
πάρα πολλούς για να τους αναφέρω εδώ
(αλλά αν θέλετε να μάθετε περισσότερα
, ρωτήστε και θα σας απαντήσω!). Όμως,
όπως πολλά χωριά στην Ελλάδα με την
πάροδο των χρόνων πολλοί από τους
κατοίκους του χωριού μετακινήθηκαν
στις πόλεις, στην Αθήνα ή στα Ιωάννινα
(με πληθυσμό περίπου 170,000), τα οποία
απέχουν 25 km,
με αποτέλεσμα να μειωθούν τόσο οι
ευκαιρίες στο χωριό, όσο και ο αριθμός
των νέων ανθρώπων και οικογενειών. Η
Ζίτσα στο παρελθόν είχε πολλές μικρές
επιχειρήσεις που εξυπηρετούσαν τους
κατοίκους, οι οποίοι δεν χρειάζονταν
να πηγαίνουν στην πόλη για να καλύψουν
τις βασικές τους ανάγκες, όμως αυτές,
δυστυχώς, δεν υπάρχουν πια. Το ταξίδι
στα Ιωάννινα δεν είναι πάντα εύκολο –
πολλοί από τους μεγαλύτερους ανθρώπους
δεν έχουν αυτοκίνητα ή δεν μπορούν να
οδηγήσουν, η συγκοινωνία δεν είναι συχνή
(ανύπαρκτη το σαββατοκύριακο) και
χρονοβόρα (μια ώρα με το λεωφορείο, ενώ
με το αυτοκίνητο 25-30 λεπτά). Είναι επίσης
ακριβή συγκριτικά με το μέσο εισόδημα
στην Ελλάδα, για να μην αναφέρω την
τρέχουσα κρίση. 
</p>
<p>
Ζω τρία χρόνια
εδώ και μολονότι δεν ήταν πάντα εύκολη
η μετάβαση σε μία ολοκληρωτικά καινούρια
ζωή (και καινούρια γλώσσα – ναι!) η
καταπληκτική υποδοχή των απίστευτα
ζεστών ανθρώπων εδώ έκανε αναμφίβολα
πιο εύκολη την αλλαγή. Ήρθα εδώ, επειδή
ερωτεύτηκα έναν άνθρωπο και μετά
ερωτεύτηκα το χωριό. Και επειδή είμαι
παθιασμένη με τη Ζίτσα και όσα πιστεύω
ότι μπορούν να γίνουν εδώ, θέλω να βοηθήσω
στον εκσυγχρονισμό της.</p>
<p>
Και εδώ είναι
που κάνει την εμφάνισή του το βιβλιοπωλείο.
Το πάθος μου για το νέο  μου χωριό
επισκιάζεται μόνο από το πάθος μου για
κάθε λογής βιβλία – αλλά όχι απλά να
διαβάζω βιβλία. Μου αρέσει να μοιράζομαι
βιβλία, να εμπλέκομαι με βιβλία με το
να διαβάζω, να γράφω, να ακούω, να μιλάω
γι’αυτα. Μου αρέσει να διδάσκω και να
μαθαίνω και λατρεύω την ιδέα της
δημιουργίας ενός βιβλιοπωλείου, όπου
μπορεί να χτιστεί μία λογοτεχνική
κοινότητα. Θέλω να μοιραστώ την αγάπη
και το πάθος μου για τα βιβλία, για όλα
τα βιβλία, με όλους τους ανθρώπους.</p>
<p>
Συγχρόνως
το βιβλιοπωλείο θα εξυπηρετήσει κάποιες
ανάγκες της Ζίτσας και των γειτονικών
χωριών – με το βιβλιοπωλείο αυτό οι
άνθρωποι δεν θα είναι πλέον αναγκασμένοι
να διανύσουν όλη την απόσταση μέχρι τα
Ιωάννινα (ή ακόμη μεγαλύτερη αν έρχονται
από κάποιο διπλανό χωριό) για να πάρουν
βιβλία και σχολικά βοηθήματα. Ούτε θα
χρειάζεται να φεύγουν απ’ το χωριό τους
 για να βρουν και να συμμετάσχουν σε
πολιτιστικές δραστηριότητες. Το
βιβλιοπωλείο αυτό θα βοηθήσει να παγιωθεί
η Ζίτσα ως ένα πολιτιστικό κέντρο μακριά
από την πόλη αφού θα γίνονται πολυάριθμες
και συνεχείς εκδηλώσεις και σεμινάρια,
από συγγραφή και πλέξιμο μέχρι παρουσιάσεις
τοπικών συγγραφέων, διεθνή μουσική και
επιδείξεις τεχνών (ο Κώστας και εγώ
φιλοξενούμε ξένους ταξιδιώτες μέσω του
«Couchsurfing»,
εκ των οποίων πολλοί έχουν εκφράσει το
ενδιαφέρον να μοιραστούν ιστορίες από
τις χώρες τους καθώς και τα ταλέντα και
τα ενδιαφέροντα τους). Επιπλέον, θα
αυξήσει τον τουρισμό και θα βοηθήσει
τον ξένο πληθυσμό που ζει εδώ, καθώς θα
υπάρχουν βιβλία σε πολλές γλώσσες
ξεκινώντας με ελληνικά, αγγλικά και
αλβανικά και στην πορεία γερμανικά,
γαλλικά, εβραϊκά και θα διευρυνθούν,
όσο είναι δυνατό.</p>
<p>
Το μοναδικό
σχολείο αγγλικών εδώ έκλεισε το περασμένο
καλοκαίρι, οπότε σχεδιάζω να οργανώνω
εκδηλώσεις για τα παιδιά (και όσους
ενήλικες θέλουν να παρευρίσκονται,
φυσικά) στις οποίες θα διαβάζω βιβλία
στα παιδιά στα ελληνικά (ενόσω τα παιδιά
θα γελάνε με τα φριχτά ελληνικά μου!)
και μετά θα διαβάζω το ίδιο βιβλίο στα
αγγλικά. Μπορεί να μην είναι οργανωμένα
μαθήματα, αλλά θα είναι ένας τρόπος για
τα παιδιά να μάθουν και να εξοικειωθούν
με τη γλώσσα.</p>
<p>
Τέλος, το
βιβλιοπωλείο όχι μόνο θα πουλάει
καινούρια και μεταχειρισμένα βιβλία,
αλλά θα είναι ένα, αν όχι το ΜΟΝΑΔΙΚΟ,
από τα βιβλιοπωλεία στην Ελλάδα που θα
νοικιάζει βιβλία – θα είναι κάτι σαν
ιδιωτική βιβλιοθήκη. Και επειδή επιθυμώ
οι συγχωριανοί να έχουν εύκολη
προσβασιμότητα στα βιβλία, θα κρατήσω
τις τιμές χαμηλά.</p>
<p>
Και γι’ αυτό
χρειάζομαι κάποια βοήθεια.</p>
<p>
<b>Τι χρειαζόμαστε
από εσάς:</b></p>
<p>
Ο Κώστας και
εγώ έχουμε ήδη δώσει πολλές από τις
οικονομίες μας σ’ αυτό το project
και θα συνεχίσουμε να το κάνουμε. Επίσης,
τον Αύγουστο κέρδισα μία επιχορήγηση
από την Ε.Ε. για νέους επιχειρηματίες
για να ξεκινήσουν νέες επιχειρήσεις. 
</p>
<p>
Ωστόσο, οι
οικονομίες μας και η επιχορήγηση δεν
είναι αρκετές για να καλύψουν όλα τα
αρχικά έξοδα. Τα χρήματα που ελπίζουμε
να συγκεντρώσουμε εδώ θα χρησιμεύσουν
για:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Βιβλία,
βιβλία, βιβλία!! Τα ράφια που έχουμε
είναι ως επί το πλείστον ακόμη άδεια –
αυτή τη στιγμή τα μόνα βιβλία που υπάρχουν
είναι από τις προσωπικές μας συλλογές
και κάποιες δωρεές. Με τα χρήματα που
θα συγκεντρώσουμε θα μπορέσουμε να
αγοράσουμε τα πρώτα καινούρια και
μεταχειρισμένα βιβλία για να γεμίσουμε
τα ράφια και στη συνέχεια το βιβλιοπωλείο
θα αυτό-συντηρείται, καθώς θα χρησιμοποιούμε
τα χρήματα από τις πωλήσεις και τις
ενοικιάσεις βιβλίων για να επεκτείνουμε
το απόθεμα μας.</li>
<li>
<span>Ράφια &amp; επίπλωση. Ο χώρος είναι περίπου 70% πλήρης, αλλά δεν μπορούμε να κάνουμε πολλά περισσότερα μέχρι να λάβουμε κάποια χρηματοδότηση.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>Εκδηλώσεις/Σεμινάρια/Προγράμματα.
Επειδή θέλω όλοι οι κάτοικοι του χωριού
να μπορούν να παίρνουν μέρος στις
διάφορες εκδηλώσεις και στα προγράμματα
που θα διοργανώνω κάθε λίγες εβδομάδες
στο βιβλιοπωλείο, αλλά δεν θέλω να χρεώνω
την συμμετοχή και επειδή, όπως καταλαβαίνετε
θα υπάρχει, κάποιο κόστος (υλικά, εξωτερική
συνδρομή κ.α.), ελπίζω να μπορώ να τα
καλύψω με τα χρήματα που θα συγκεντρωθούν.

Me And This Project: 



My
name is Anna and I live in the small, 500-person village of Zitsa in
the northwest mountains of Greece. I moved here from the United
States (where I had been an environmental lawyer) to be with the love
of my life, and now husband, Kostas (the baker of the village!).  Zitsa
is an amazing village for so many reasons, too many to list here (but
if you want to know, ask and I'll respond!). But like many villages
in Greece, over the years much of the ""life"" of the village
has migrated out to the closest city, Ioannina (population about
170,000), which is 25K (15
miles), and as the opportunities in the village have diminished, so
have the number of young people
and families. Zitsa used to have a lot more small businesses and
people did not have to trek
into the city for many basic necessities that were available here,
but are no longer. The journey
into Ioannina is not always easy - many of the older people don't
have cars or can't drive, the
public transportation is infrequent (or unavailable - there are no
buses on weekends), and it takes
a very long time (about an hour each way, whereas by car it's about
25-30 min.). It's also expensive
given the average income in Greece, not to mention the current
crisis. 



I
have lived here a little over 3 years now, and though it has not
always been easy to transition to an entirely new life (and new
language - yeesh!), the wonderful welcome from the incredibly warm
people here has definitely eased the change. I came here because I
fell in love with a person, and then I fell in love with the village.
And because I am passionate about Zitsa and all I believe it can be,
I want to help revitalize it. 



This
is where the bookstore comes in. My passion for my adopted village is
only eclipsed by my passion for all things books - but not just
reading books. I love sharing books, engaging in books through
reading, writing, listening, and sharing. I love teaching, and
learning, and I love the idea of  creating a bookstore around which a
literary community can be built. I want to share my love and passion
for books, for all books, to all people. 



At
the same time, the bookstore will bring some needed services to Zitsa
and the villages around - with this bookstore, people will no longer
have to travel all the way into Ioannina (or further if coming
from a neighboring village) to get books and school supplies. Nor
will they have to travel
outside their home village to find and engage in cultural activities.
This bookshop will help
cement Zitsa as a cultural center away from the city as I will have
numerous and continuous events
and seminars, everything from writing and knitting clubs to local
author presentations to international
music and crafts demonstrations (Kostas & I host a LOT of foreign
travelers through
Couchsurfing and many have expressed interest in sharing stories
about their home countries
as well as their talents and passions). It will increase tourism and
also help the immigrant
populations that live here as I will have books in many languages
starting with Greek, English,
and Albanian, and then expanding to German, French, Hebrew and so on,
as I can. 




The
only English school around this area closed here in Zitsa last year,
so I also plan on holding story times for children (and any adults
who want to come, of course) where I will read books to the
kids in Greek (while the kids laugh at my terrible Greek!) and then
read the same book in English.
It may not be structured lessons, but it will be a way for the kids
to learn and engage in the
language. 




Finally,
this bookshop will not only sell new and used books, but it will be
one of, if not the ONLY,
bookshop in Greece to rent books - it will be almost like a private
library. And because I want
the villagers to have easy accessibility to books, I will keep the
costs very low. 



This
is why I need some help. 






What
We Need From You: 



Kostas
and I have already and will continue to put a lot of our own savings
into this project. 


Also,
in Aug. 2013 I was awarded a grant from the EU for young
entrepreneurs to start new businesses in Greece. 



But
our savings, and the grant, are not enough to cover all our start-up
costs. The money we hope
to raise here will pay for: 







Books,
books, books!! The shelves we have are still mostly empty - right now
the only books
we have are from our personal collections and some donations. With
the money we
raise, we will be able to buy the first shipment of new & used
books to fill the shop, and
then the shop will be self-sustaining as we will use the money from
book sales and rentals
to buy more inventory. 


Shelves
& furnishings. The physical space is about 70% complete but we
can't do much more until we receive some funding.

Events/Seminars/Programs.
Because I want all the villagers to be able to participate in the
various events and programs I will have every few weeks in the
bookshop, I do not want
to charge for attendance. But there will be some costs involved
(materials, financial
assistance to authors and other professionals to travel & stay
here, etc.) and I hope to use funds raised here to cover some of
those costs. 





What
You Will Get From Us: 





Undying
gratitude. 



Just
kidding - there's more ;) Since you might want something a little
more fun, some of the perks
we have for you are*: 






Personally
designed Zitsa postcards made from our own photography portfolio 


Bookmarks
with the stanzas about Zitsa from Lord Byron's famous poem ""Childe Harold's
Pilgrimage"" written in both English & Greek 



Unique
Bookgarden T-shirts with our logo made specifically for this campaign
- after the campaign
ends, they will be discontinued 



Bookgarden
book bags with literary quotes in English & Greek and our logo 


The
opportunity to name a bookshelf - you can use your own name, or make
up something




2-night's
stay at the gorgeous hotel here in Zitsa and 2 days of guided tourism
of the region
by us (airfare not included - but all food & accommodations are
taken care of). 



Bakery
Box filled with homemade surprises! 




Can't
Contribute Financially? Send Books! 



Do
you want to help but can't contribute financially? Well, we always
need books. If you have some
you don't want or need anymore, or just want to give away, please
send them to us!! 


Languages
other than English or Greek would be most appreciated, though we will
take anything.
As a thank-you for books you send, you will receive (unless you
indicate that you do not want a perk): 



-
1-3 book = 1 postcard 



-
4-7 books = 2 postcards 



-
8-11 books = 2 postcards + 1 bookmark 



-
12-15 books = 2 postcards, 1 bookmark + 1 t-shirt 



-
16 books or more = just send money as the shipping to Greece for so
many books could be ridiculous!
But, if you do want to send so many books, you get 2 postcards, 1
bookmark, and 1 book
bag. 




No
Books? Tell A Friend! 



Also,
just spreading the word about this campaign would be tremendous help.
Put it on Facebook,
Twitter, and other social media outlets. Put a link on your blog.
Send personal e-mails
to your friends and family. Every bit helps!!! 





Thank
you! 



Thank
you so, so much just for reading. If you have any questions or
comments whatsoever, do not
hesitate to contact us at zitsabookgarden@hotmail.com. Thanks again!

for items that need to be shipped the expected delivery date is not
until the beginning of June due to extended shipping times from
Greece. 
Σχετικά με
μένα και το project:

Ονομάζομαι
 Άννα Έλλις και ζω σε ένα μικρό χωριό
(500 κατοίκων), τη Ζίτσα στα βορειοδυτικά
βουνά της Ελλάδας. Μετακόμισα εδώ από
τις Ηνωμένες Πολιτείες για να είμαι με
τον έρωτα της ζωής μου, και τώρα σύζυγο
μου, τον Κώστα ( που είναι ο φούρναρης
του χωριού!).

Η Ζίτσα είναι
ένα εκπληκτικό χωριό για πολλούς λόγους,
πάρα πολλούς για να τους αναφέρω εδώ
(αλλά αν θέλετε να μάθετε περισσότερα
, ρωτήστε και θα σας απαντήσω!). Όμως,
όπως πολλά χωριά στην Ελλάδα με την
πάροδο των χρόνων πολλοί από τους
κατοίκους του χωριού μετακινήθηκαν
στις πόλεις, στην Αθήνα ή στα Ιωάννινα
(με πληθυσμό περίπου 170,000), τα οποία
απέχουν 25 km,
με αποτέλεσμα να μειωθούν τόσο οι
ευκαιρίες στο χωριό, όσο και ο αριθμός
των νέων ανθρώπων και οικογενειών. Η
Ζίτσα στο παρελθόν είχε πολλές μικρές
επιχειρήσεις που εξυπηρετούσαν τους
κατοίκους, οι οποίοι δεν χρειάζονταν
να πηγαίνουν στην πόλη για να καλύψουν
τις βασικές τους ανάγκες, όμως αυτές,
δυστυχώς, δεν υπάρχουν πια. Το ταξίδι
στα Ιωάννινα δεν είναι πάντα εύκολο –
πολλοί από τους μεγαλύτερους ανθρώπους
δεν έχουν αυτοκίνητα ή δεν μπορούν να
οδηγήσουν, η συγκοινωνία δεν είναι συχνή
(ανύπαρκτη το σαββατοκύριακο) και
χρονοβόρα (μια ώρα με το λεωφορείο, ενώ
με το αυτοκίνητο 25-30 λεπτά). Είναι επίσης
ακριβή συγκριτικά με το μέσο εισόδημα
στην Ελλάδα, για να μην αναφέρω την
τρέχουσα κρίση. 


Ζω τρία χρόνια
εδώ και μολονότι δεν ήταν πάντα εύκολη
η μετάβαση σε μία ολοκληρωτικά καινούρια
ζωή (και καινούρια γλώσσα – ναι!) η
καταπληκτική υποδοχή των απίστευτα
ζεστών ανθρώπων εδώ έκανε αναμφίβολα
πιο εύκολη την αλλαγή. Ήρθα εδώ, επειδή
ερωτεύτηκα έναν άνθρωπο και μετά
ερωτεύτηκα το χωριό. Και επειδή είμαι
παθιασμένη με τη Ζίτσα και όσα πιστεύω
ότι μπορούν να γίνουν εδώ, θέλω να βοηθήσω
στον εκσυγχρονισμό της.

Και εδώ είναι
που κάνει την εμφάνισή του το βιβλιοπωλείο.
Το πάθος μου για το νέο  μου χωριό
επισκιάζεται μόνο από το πάθος μου για
κάθε λογής βιβλία – αλλά όχι απλά να
διαβάζω βιβλία. Μου αρέσει να μοιράζομαι
βιβλία, να εμπλέκομαι με βιβλία με το
να διαβάζω, να γράφω, να ακούω, να μιλάω
γι’αυτα. Μου αρέσει να διδάσκω και να
μαθαίνω και λατρεύω την ιδέα της
δημιουργίας ενός βιβλιοπωλείου, όπου
μπορεί να χτιστεί μία λογοτεχνική
κοινότητα. Θέλω να μοιραστώ την αγάπη
και το πάθος μου για τα βιβλία, για όλα
τα βιβλία, με όλους τους ανθρώπους.

Συγχρόνως
το βιβλιοπωλείο θα εξυπηρετήσει κάποιες
ανάγκες της Ζίτσας και των γειτονικών
χωριών – με το βιβλιοπωλείο αυτό οι
άνθρωποι δεν θα είναι πλέον αναγκασμένοι
να διανύσουν όλη την απόσταση μέχρι τα
Ιωάννινα (ή ακόμη μεγαλύτερη αν έρχονται
από κάποιο διπλανό χωριό) για να πάρουν
βιβλία και σχολικά βοηθήματα. Ούτε θα
χρειάζεται να φεύγουν απ’ το χωριό τους
 για να βρουν και να συμμετάσχουν σε
πολιτιστικές δραστηριότητες. Το
βιβλιοπωλείο αυτό θα βοηθήσει να παγιωθεί
η Ζίτσα ως ένα πολιτιστικό κέντρο μακριά
από την πόλη αφού θα γίνονται πολυάριθμες
και συνεχείς εκδηλώσεις και σεμινάρια,
από συγγραφή και πλέξιμο μέχρι παρουσιάσεις
τοπικών συγγραφέων, διεθνή μουσική και
επιδείξεις τεχνών (ο Κώστας και εγώ
φιλοξενούμε ξένους ταξιδιώτες μέσω του
«Couchsurfing»,
εκ των οποίων πολλοί έχουν εκφράσει το
ενδιαφέρον να μοιραστούν ιστορίες από
τις χώρες τους καθώς και τα ταλέντα και
τα ενδιαφέροντα τους). Επιπλέον, θα
αυξήσει τον τουρισμό και θα βοηθήσει
τον ξένο πληθυσμό που ζει εδώ, καθώς θα
υπάρχουν βιβλία σε πολλές γλώσσες
ξεκινώντας με ελληνικά, αγγλικά και
αλβανικά και στην πορεία γερμανικά,
γαλλικά, εβραϊκά και θα διευρυνθούν,
όσο είναι δυνατό.

Το μοναδικό
σχολείο αγγλικών εδώ έκλεισε το περασμένο
καλοκαίρι, οπότε σχεδιάζω να οργανώνω
εκδηλώσεις για τα παιδιά (και όσους
ενήλικες θέλουν να παρευρίσκονται,
φυσικά) στις οποίες θα διαβάζω βιβλία
στα παιδιά στα ελληνικά (ενόσω τα παιδιά
θα γελάνε με τα φριχτά ελληνικά μου!)
και μετά θα διαβάζω το ίδιο βιβλίο στα
αγγλικά. Μπορεί να μην είναι οργανωμένα
μαθήματα, αλλά θα είναι ένας τρόπος για
τα παιδιά να μάθουν και να εξοικειωθούν
με τη γλώσσα.

Τέλος, το
βιβλιοπωλείο όχι μόνο θα πουλάει
καινούρια και μεταχειρισμένα βιβλία,
αλλά θα είναι ένα, αν όχι το ΜΟΝΑΔΙΚΟ,
από τα βιβλιοπωλεία στην Ελλάδα που θα
νοικιάζει βιβλία – θα είναι κάτι σαν
ιδιωτική βιβλιοθήκη. Και επειδή επιθυμώ
οι συγχωριανοί να έχουν εύκολη
προσβασιμότητα στα βιβλία, θα κρατήσω
τις τιμές χαμηλά.

Και γι’ αυτό
χρειάζομαι κάποια βοήθεια.

Τι χρειαζόμαστε
από εσάς:

Ο Κώστας και
εγώ έχουμε ήδη δώσει πολλές από τις
οικονομίες μας σ’ αυτό το project
και θα συνεχίσουμε να το κάνουμε. Επίσης,
τον Αύγουστο κέρδισα μία επιχορήγηση
από την Ε.Ε. για νέους επιχειρηματίες
για να ξεκινήσουν νέες επιχειρήσεις. 


Ωστόσο, οι
οικονομίες μας και η επιχορήγηση δεν
είναι αρκετές για να καλύψουν όλα τα
αρχικά έξοδα. Τα χρήματα που ελπίζουμε
να συγκεντρώσουμε εδώ θα χρησιμεύσουν
για:


Βιβλία,
βιβλία, βιβλία!! Τα ράφια που έχουμε
είναι ως επί το πλείστον ακόμη άδεια –
αυτή τη στιγμή τα μόνα βιβλία που υπάρχουν
είναι από τις προσωπικές μας συλλογές
και κάποιες δωρεές. Με τα χρήματα που
θα συγκεντρώσουμε θα μπορέσουμε να
αγοράσουμε τα πρώτα καινούρια και
μεταχειρισμένα βιβλία για να γεμίσουμε
τα ράφια και στη συνέχεια το βιβλιοπωλείο
θα αυτό-συντηρείται, καθώς θα χρησιμοποιούμε
τα χρήματα από τις πωλήσεις και τις
ενοικιάσεις βιβλίων για να επεκτείνουμε
το απόθεμα μας.

Ράφια & επίπλωση. Ο χώρος είναι περίπου 70% πλήρης, αλλά δεν μπορούμε να κάνουμε πολλά περισσότερα μέχρι να λάβουμε κάποια χρηματοδότηση.

Εκδηλώσεις/Σεμινάρια/Προγράμματα.
Επειδή θέλω όλοι οι κάτοικοι του χωριού
να μπορούν να παίρνουν μέρος στις
διάφορες εκδηλώσεις και στα προγράμματα
που θα διοργανώνω κάθε λίγες εβδομάδες
στο βιβλιοπωλείο, αλλά δεν θέλω να χρεώνω
την συμμετοχή και επειδή, όπως καταλαβαίνετε
θα υπάρχει, κάποιο κόστος (υλικά, εξωτερική
συνδρομή κ.α.), ελπίζω να μπορώ να τα
καλύψω με τα χρήματα που θα συγκεντρωθούν.


Τι θα πάρετε
από εμάς:

Ατελείωτη
ευγνωμοσύνη.


Αστειεύομαι
– υπάρχουν κι άλλα. Επειδή ίσως θέλετε
κάτι λίγο πιο διασκεδαστικό, κάποια απ’
τα δωράκια που έχουμε για εσάς είναι:*

Προσωπικά
σχεδιασμένα καρτ-ποστάλ από τη Ζίτσα
φτιαγμένα από το δικό μας φωτογραφικό
αρχείο.

Σελιδοδείκτες
με τυπωμένες τις στροφές που αναφέρονται
στη Ζίτσα απ’ το γνωστό ποίημα του
Λόρδου Βύρωνος «Το προσκύνημα του
Τσάιλντ Χάρολντ» τόσο στα αγγλικά, όσο
και στα ελληνικά.

Μοναδικά
μπλουζάκια με το λογότυπό μας « Ο
Βιβλιόκηπος» φτιαγμένα αποκλειστικά
γι’ αυτή την καμπάνια – με το τέλος της
καμπάνιας θα καταργηθούν.

Τσάντες
για βιβλία με το λογότυπό μας πάνω  και
τυπωμένα  λογοτεχνικά γνωμικά σε αγγλικά
και ελληνικά.

Την
ευκαιρία να δώσετε όνομα σε ένα ράφι
βιβλίων – μπορείτε να χρησιμοποιήσετε
το όνομα σας ή να δημιουργήσετε κάποιο.

Διαμονή
για 2 βράδια στο υπέροχο ξενοδοχείο της
Ζίτσας και 2 μέρες ξενάγηση στην περιοχή
από εμάς (δεν συμπεριλαμβάνονται
αεροπορικά εισιτήρια – αλλά θα φροντίσουμε
για την διατροφή και την εξυπηρέτησή
σας).

Κουτί
από το φούρνο μας γεμάτο με σπιτικές
εκπλήξεις!


Δεν μπορείτε
να συνεισφέρετε οικονομικά; Στείλτε
βιβλία!

Θέλετε να
βοηθήσετε αλλά δεν μπορείτε να μας
στηρίξετε οικονομικά; Λοιπόν, πάντα
χρειαζόμαστε βιβλία. Αν έχετε κάποια
που δεν θέλετε ή δεν χρειάζεστε πια, ή
απλά θέλετε να τα δωρίσετε, σας παρακαλούμε
στείλτε τα σ’ εμάς!!Όλα τα βιβλία είναι
ευπρόσδεκτα. Για τα βιβλία που θα στείλετε
θα λάβετε (εκτός αν δεν θέλετε) ένα
ευχαριστήριο δωράκι:
 1-3
βιβλία = 1 καρτ-ποστάλ

4-7
βιβλία = 2 καρτ-ποστάλ

8-11
βιβλία = 2 καρτ-ποστάλ + 1 σελιδοδείκτη

12-15
βιβλία = 2 καρτ-ποστάλ, 1 σελιδοδείκτη +
1 μπλουζάκι.

16
ή περισσότερα βιβλία = απλά στείλτε
χρήματα αφού τα έξοδα αποστολής για
τόσα πολλά βιβλία θα την παράλογα! Αλλά,
αν επιθυμείτε να στείλετε τόσα βιβλία
θα πάρετε 2 καρτ-ποστάλς, 1 σελιδοδείκτη
+ 1 τσάντα για βιβλία.

Αν δεν
μπορείτε χρήματα ή βιβλία  τότε διαδωστε
την καμπάνια μας .Πείτε το σ’ ένα φίλο!

Ακόμη και το
να μεταδώσετε αυτή την καμπάνια στον
κόσμο θα ήταν τεράστια βοήθεια. Αναρτήστε

<p><strong>What exactly is 3D printing?</strong></p>
<p>The term “3D printing” refers to processes that automatically build objects layer by layer from computer data. Materials used in 3D printing include resins, plastics and, in some cases, metal.</p>
<p><strong>Soon everyone will have a 3D printer in their home!</strong></p>
<p>Recent developments in the industry have revolutionized how 3D printers are used and who uses them. With billions of dollars being invested in the technology 3D printers have now moved from the corporate world to the living room. Anyone with a computer and a 3D printer can make virtually anything they want right in their own home. And the cost of 3D printers has dropped below $1,000.00 for a basic model.</p>
<p>Manufacturers are predicting that within 15 years every home will have at least one 3D printer and most will have more than one. There will be one in your kitchen to make your food and another one to make physical objects that you need or would like to sell. Thousands of new home based businesses will spring up due to the low cost of 3D printers and the simplicity of using them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The 3D printing revolution is moving at hyper-speed and to stay current with what is happening in the industry enthusiasts need to tune into a single source that keeps track of everything related to 3D printing. That single source is the 3D Printer Club. </p>
