<p>I am an Environmental Science and Policy undergraduate (graduating this semester!) at Humboldt State University in Northern California. I come from the Colorado Rocky Mountains, and have been fortunate to travel and see many incredible things. I've viewed the world from a 14,000 ft peak, gotten sea sick off the Na Pali Coast,  ridden camels in the Judean Desert, marveled at human potential in Tenochtitlan, and enjoyed the 4th of July Fireworks on the roof of my house. I am now working to join a 6-week Environmental Engineering study abroad program in the Dominican Republic this summer.<br/></p>
<p>This program visits Santo Domingo to build Appropriate Technology (sustainable engineering) 
projects in partnership with the local community. This is done by working with
 the community to identify needs and available resources, test the 
resources and methods available, and develop a plan to build a 
sustainable and durable project that meets the community's needs. Within this program, there is no profit motive. This is entirely for learning and providing innovative solutions.</p>
<p> Past projects include a school house built with walls 
made out of plastic bottles, a pharmacy with cinder blocks made from 
local waste products in partnership with a local manufacturer's 
facility, rainwater catchment facilities, renewable energy projects, and
 so much more. <br/>
</p>
<p>While in the DR, I will gain 8-units and build a to-be-determined renewable energy or sustainable resource
 project based on the community's needs. I will stay with a host family 
which will allow me to truly immerse myself in the culture and allow me 
to gain valuable insight on life in the Dominican Republic throughout 
the project.This
 is not a top-down project, but a horizontally based opportunity that 
empowers people across the globe to help each other, hone their own 
personal skills, and develop individuals and communities that are full 
of character, expertise, and contribute to the wider society as a whole.</p>

<p>I
have worked as a pizza maker, bagel maker, sandwich maker, law-firm runner,
barista, manager, volunteer, organizer, and Co-Director. <br/></p>
<p>Since living in Humboldt for the past three years, I've volunteered in
 a variety of manners and spearheaded a multitude of successful projects. <br/>Volunteer and relevant experience includes (but is not limited to):<br/>1) Arcata Marsh 
Interpretive Center Staffer. Provided info to passers-by on this system which serves as the city's Water Treatment System. <br/>2) President
 of HSU's Natural Resources Club: Coordinated community restoration projects with local non-profits almost every Saturday 
for two years.<br/>3) Co-Director for the Campus 
Center for Appropriate Technology (CCAT). This is a student-run, student-funded,
 sustainable-living demonstration house on campus which is home to a 
variety of ""appropriate technologies"" such as rainwater catchment, a 
greenhouse, cob structures, and a 
solar charging station for everyday devices. This experience directly translates into the Practivistas program.<br/>4) Student Board Member on the university's 
Advancement Foundation Board whom I successfully convinced to commit to 
Divesting from Fossil Fuels (<a href=""http://gofossilfree.org/usa/the-story-of-divesting-at-humboldt-state-university/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://gofossilfree.org/usa/the-story-of-divest...</a>) with a fellow organizer and student support.

 with the coalition of students who collaborated to put on Earth Week. 
We just finished our second annual Earth Week this year which was much larger and more successful than last year's as a result of the my efforts with peers last year and a highly expanded collaborative team effort this year with other student leaders on 
campus.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Challenges</h3> <p>My main challenge is not having an income or time to make any money. I am a full-time student (15-units) and work full-time as a live-in Co-Director of CCAT. This is a work trade that allows me free rent and utilities without higher compensation.. I am so fortunate to have this opportunity, but I work a minimum of 30-hours per week (meetings, coordinating, planning, emails, running Volunteer Fridays, etc.) in this position which leaves me no time for an outside income source. Therefore, I cannot provide any more income for this incredible opportunity.</p>

<p>Forivor’s super-soft luxurious organic bedding plays with the idea of transformation to transport you between two different lands.</p>
<p>Designed in the UK, our beautiful reversible bedding features a unique hand-drawn illustration on each side and is accompanied by a set of illustrated Character Cards that provide facts about nature and storytelling cues. </p>
<p>One side of the bedding depicts a British woodland, where wildlife hides in the undergrowth and up in the branches of the trees for children to find. Turning over the bedding reveals a transformed nighttime world. A place of wonder, where glow worms light up the enchanted forest and fantastical creatures play in secret burrows underground.</p>

<p>Our Enchanted Forest single duvet and pillow case (as shown above and below) are made from the softest organic cotton satin with a simple hidden button closure on the duvet and classic envelope style pillow slips.The duvet measures 140 X 200cm and the pillowcase is 75 X 50cm.</p>
<div> </div>
<p>The duvet set comes in a Forivor suitcase (see below) and is accompanied by a set of Junior Character Cards. The cards draw on the popularity of collectable cards, providing interesting and memorable facts about wildlife on one side, encouraging children to explore and understand the world around them. The other side introduces the transformed creatures of Forivorland, their secrets and magic powers. Storytelling cues and questions encourage children to create their own bedtime tales.</p>

<p>As well as creating magical childhood memories, oral storytelling plays an important role in the development of a child’s creative mind, memory development and language skills. We believe that by encouraging children to be storytellers who are passionate about nature, we can help nurture a generation of responsible guardians for the planet.</p>

<p>We are Rebecca Attwood and Alice Ross - co-directors with a mission to inspire magical sleep!</p>
<p>The idea for Forivor, which is named after Rebecca's father Ivor, came to Rebecca after trying and failing to write a story for her goddaughter and coincidentally trying (and failing) to find beautiful organic bedding. She was inspired by her childhood growing up without electricity on the Welsh borders as well as her work with iconic British designer Katharine Hamnett and the Environmental Justice Foundation. Alice's detailed and evocative drawings were the perfect partner for this unique concept and so a dream team was formed. And we both just happen to love anything pickled and a certain shade of dusky pink.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have spent two years perfecting our designs and the supply chain to ensure we have confidence in our supply chain and are offering the finest most luxurious and environmentally friendly product. </p>
<p>However as with any business that imports goods from overseas there are risks. For example during our sampling process we waited an additional 6 weeks for our sample collection to arrive as the shipment had been caught in the worst flooding in 100 years in Chennai, India. We have factored in additional time should our changing climate be unpredictable again.</p>
</div></div>","Forivor’s super-soft luxurious organic bedding plays with the idea of transformation to transport you between two different lands.
Designed in the UK, our beautiful reversible bedding features a unique hand-drawn illustration on each side and is accompanied by a set of illustrated Character Cards that provide facts about nature and storytelling cues. 
One side of the bedding depicts a British woodland, where wildlife hides in the undergrowth and up in the branches of the trees for children to find. Turning over the bedding reveals a transformed nighttime world. A place of wonder, where glow worms light up the enchanted forest and fantastical creatures play in secret burrows underground.



 

Our Enchanted Forest single duvet and pillow case (as shown above and below) are made from the softest organic cotton satin with a simple hidden button closure on the duvet and classic envelope style pillow slips.The duvet measures 140 X 200cm and the pillowcase is 75 X 50cm.
 
The duvet set comes in a Forivor suitcase (see below) and is accompanied by a set of Junior Character Cards. The cards draw on the popularity of collectable cards, providing interesting and memorable facts about wildlife on one side, encouraging children to explore and understand the world around them. The other side introduces the transformed creatures of Forivorland, their secrets and magic powers. Storytelling cues and questions encourage children to create their own bedtime tales.

As well as creating magical childhood memories, oral storytelling plays an important role in the development of a child’s creative mind, memory development and language skills. We believe that by encouraging children to be storytellers who are passionate about nature, we can help nurture a generation of responsible guardians for the planet.






The Enchanted Forest Quilted Blanket is made from super-soft 300 thread count organic cotton satin and stuffed with a bouncy organic cotton wadding that makes it unbelievably soft for young delicate skin. 

It measures 105 X 150cm and is perfect as a blanket or playmat for babies or as a duvet for toddlers and young children. 
 
Our Baby Character Cards accompany the quilted blanket and feature large black and white illustrations with lyrical descriptions of animal sounds and characteristics for parents to enjoy reading and learning with their young children.

<p>The owner, Christine decided to take her love of weddings and turn it into a business! She was selling simple invitations on Etsy when she was asked if a Save the Date that she designed came with invitations and RSVP's. Although that customer never purchased invitations, Christine got the notion that she wanted to design invitations! One day later, Southern Papercraft was born, the domain was registered and Christine hasn't looked back since! </p>

<p>In 2009, the US became unemployed.</p>
<p>A family of 6, 2 dogs and cat moved from Florida to Washington to start a new life.  The father was an unemployed General Contractor and the mom was an unemployed Economics teacher with a brand new MBA.  They had run out of choices, so they chose to move.</p>
<p>This is their story, this is my story.</p>
<p>We weren't the only ones devastated by a sudden shift in our comfy middle class lifestyle, a lot of others were in the same boat.</p>
<p>Unable to find employment in Washington, I decided to start making soap, terrifically natural, beautiful, abundantly fragranced soaps.</p>
<p>What started as coffee money is now providing a living for myself and helping another woman, Jody, a single mom of two.</p>
<p>As of today, Snohomish Soap products can be found in all 9 PCC's in the Seattle area and by mid-October, all 28 Haggen stores throughout the northwest.  In the spring, we'll be launching on Walmart.com.  </p>
<p>We have two markets we are targeting: Natural Markets like Whole Foods and PCC and National Retailers like Kroger, Walmart, and Walgreen's.  These 2 distinct markets have one type of customer in common!  Those customers who are looking for products produced locally and ethically!  These are what folks are calling “conscious consumers”</p>
<p>The problem is, how does a local, craft soap company scale, make a social impact (really important to us) and remain local.  We do it by building a national network of authentically local soap manufacturing sites with moms making soap from their homes.  Its a scalable, sustainable model.</p>
<p>These women will provide the manufacturing needs of the smaller regional retailers and for their community farmers markets.  That's where I started!  Its been a terrific way to connect to my community and build meaningful networks.  We'll stick with my branding, my packaging, my formula.  But, we'll brand it with ""their"" location...for example...Philly Soap Company, Tacoma Soap Company, etc.</p>
<p>The big retailers will continue to be supplied by our manufacturing site in the Puget Sound region.</p>
<p>The cost to get each site up and running is minimal, but we do need a vehicle for deliveries, training, etc.  Thats where you come in!</p>
<p>We're asking for $35,000 to get this amazingly simple ""back on your feet"" plan rolling..</p>
<p>Everyone uses soap, and almost anyone can make soap.  Would you throw in a little (or a lot) to help us get these struggling families moving towards recovery?   Its a WHOLE NEW MODEL and ITS GONNA WORK!</p>

<p><em>About the photo above: Children who had been in child care during a council meeting of parents, teachers, and staff entered the room as council was drawing to a close. We ended the meeting with a ""children's council"" lovingly witnessed by the adults.</em></p>
<h3>A door opens...</h3>
<p>I've been leading circles and council meetings for many years now. Council is a powerful way to contribute to the healing and repair of our broken culture. I've held council in many settings and have taught hundreds of people the foundations of council. <em>This is the kind of work that I am born to do, and I do it well.</em> </p>
<p>Now I have an opportunity to take my work as a council leader to a new level. But I need help from you, my community.</p>
<p>About a month ago I received an email from a mentor who is one of the top international teachers and leaders of the Way of Council. She told me she is ready to pass the torch, and is looking for someone to step into her shoes. She was including me on the short list of those who she felt might be ready to do the job.</p>
<p>What an honor, to be recognized in this way by someone who is a personal hero and inspiration. </p>
<p>But, she said, in order to have a shot at this, there are two things I must do. One was to attend the international Gathering of Council Carriers, which happened a couple of weeks ago. I was there. It was wonderful. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>This is where I need your help</h3>
<p>My second task is to complete a weeklong intensive training that is for dedicated and experienced leaders of council. It is scheduled for mid-September. It's going to cost about $2500 to attend this training. </p>
<p>I'm a freelance worker. I don't have a regular salary or a budget for training. The kind of work I do is vital to our times, but is not of a type that our culture rewards with salaried jobs and pensions plans. So I don't have financial resources to pay the cost of this training. I need your help. But it's not just about me...</p>

<h3>Council can help our culture heal</h3>
<p>If you've ever been in a council-style meeting you know how effectively council:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encourages deep listening to others and to our own hearts.</li>
<li>Supports us in speaking our truths.</li>
<li>Helps heal hurts in their relationships.</li>
<li>Opens pathways to discover our deep wisdom.</li>
<li>Encourages deep connectedness among people and with the land and all its inhabitants.</li>
<li>Helps participants develop a very effective, ecologically-grounded, compassionate style of leadership.</li>
</ul>
<p>After leading hundreds of council meetings in many settings, I've seen time and time again that<strong><em> there is deep power in this work.</em></strong> The Way of Council expresses perfectly the kind of shift in thinking and working together that we need if we are to become a truly just and sustainable culture.</p>
<h3><strong>How I will give back: A four-day training in council leadership</strong></h3>
<p>Besides continuing in my lifelong commitment to serving the cause of culture repair and community healing, I will give a four-day training in the art of council leadership.</p>
<ul>
<li>This training will be open to anyone who contributes at any level. It will be held in Santa Rosa.</li>
<li>I will schedule it collaboratively with donors to maximize the numbers who can attend; those who cannot will be able to attend any of my daylong introduction to council trainings, which I give monthly. </li>
<li>My goal is to consolidate my learning by giving it away immediately; and my vision is to seed our communities with a core group of council leaders who are themselves a community of change agents.  </li>
<li>This will be the same training I have taught at Sonoma State University, where tuition for the course costs over $350. My students there have unanimously agreed that the training is itself a profoundly rewarding and life-changing experience. </li>

Kinkilibaa is a leaf that grows wild in the bush, and has been drunk for its taste and curative effects for generations in the Senegambia, Mali, Guinea, and beyond.  Our focus in the states will be marketing the tea in Madison, Wisconsin, but if it is successful, we hope to expand the market for kinkilibaa to other regions of the United States.</b></span></font></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 15.0pt;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; color: #101010; letter-spacing: 1.0pt;"">Peanuts have been
grown in the Gambia since at least the 1600's, and they have been the primary
cash crop in The Gambia since the British colonial government instituted them
as such during the 19th century.  Today, however, a mold that grows on
Gambian peanuts contains a chemical called aflatoxin which is believed to have
a number of detrimental effects to health. (Put under heading of ""Why Kinkilibaa?"")</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 15.0pt;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; color: #101010; letter-spacing: 1.0pt;"">As a result, the
peanuts that small-time famers in The Gambia grow are not able to be sold to a
broad global market. The Gambian government buys them in the hope of selling
them to neighboring West African states or Asian markets, often at a loss.
 A common goal of foreign development agencies is to develop new products
to increase trade opportunities for Gambian farmers.  Examples of such
products are shea butter, cashews, and honey, yet these all require much more
time, money, and expertise than the average Gambian farmer possesses--including
the farmers in Barrow Kunda. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 15.0pt;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; color: #101010; letter-spacing: 1.0pt;"">Kinkilibaa, on the
other hand, grows wild and is easily cultivated, harvested, and dried with
local methods.  It weighs very little, so it is easy to transport, and
 a number of kinkilibaa groves already exist within walking distance of
Barrow Kunda. </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(16, 16, 16); font-family: Calibri; letter-spacing: 1px;""></span></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 15.0pt;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri; color: #101010; letter-spacing: 1.0pt;"">I was introduced to
kinkilibaa not for its value as a tea, but for the value of its wood in making
tools.  I wanted to make a musical instrument called a berimbau (I play
capoeira- that's a whole other story), and my friend Mamadi told me that
kinkilibaa  wood would offer the best combination of flexibility and
strength.  We went out and harvested a couple straight limbs from a huge
grove of trees, and Mamadi cut off some leaves and small branches as well.
 When we returned to his house and stripped the limbs of bark, Mamadi's
wife Sira brewed the leaves and branches into a tea.  I am a tea drinker
in general, but I was somewhat wary of bush teas, as many of them that I had
tried tended to have an unpleasant, medicinal taste.  This, however, was
mellow and sweet, and I drank the cup down pretty quickly.  After that, I
regularly harvested kinkilibaa for myself, as well as drinking it with my

<p></p></div>","Welcome to the Hojikoto Hojo
Campaign
The purpose of this project is to begin a trade in the herbal tea kinkilibaa with the Barrow Kunda collective in West Africa. Kinkilibaa is a leaf that grows wild in the bush, and has been drunk for its taste and curative effects for generations in the Senegambia, Mali, Guinea, and beyond.  Our focus in the states will be marketing the tea in Madison, Wisconsin, but if it is successful, we hope to expand the market for kinkilibaa to other regions of the United States.
Why Kinkilibaa?
Peanuts have been
grown in the Gambia since at least the 1600's, and they have been the primary
cash crop in The Gambia since the British colonial government instituted them
as such during the 19th century.  Today, however, a mold that grows on
Gambian peanuts contains a chemical called aflatoxin which is believed to have
a number of detrimental effects to health. (Put under heading of ""Why Kinkilibaa?"")
As a result, the
peanuts that small-time famers in The Gambia grow are not able to be sold to a
broad global market. The Gambian government buys them in the hope of selling
them to neighboring West African states or Asian markets, often at a loss.
 A common goal of foreign development agencies is to develop new products
to increase trade opportunities for Gambian farmers.  Examples of such
products are shea butter, cashews, and honey, yet these all require much more
time, money, and expertise than the average Gambian farmer possesses--including
the farmers in Barrow Kunda. 
Kinkilibaa, on the
other hand, grows wild and is easily cultivated, harvested, and dried with
local methods.  It weighs very little, so it is easy to transport, and
 a number of kinkilibaa groves already exist within walking distance of
Barrow Kunda. 
How I got interested in kinkilibaa
I'm Brendan Loula, and the idea for this project stems from my time as a Peace Corps volunteer serving in Barrow Kunda, The Gambia, from 2008-2011.  During my service, I had the pleasure of working with the Village Development committee, women's groups, and many enterprising community members on a variety of small health and development projects.  However, one of the biggest frustrations I came away with after my service was the lack of financial opportunities for Gambians. 
I was introduced to
kinkilibaa not for its value as a tea, but for the value of its wood in making
tools.  I wanted to make a musical instrument called a berimbau (I play
capoeira- that's a whole other story), and my friend Mamadi told me that
kinkilibaa  wood would offer the best combination of flexibility and
strength.  We went out and harvested a couple straight limbs from a huge
grove of trees, and Mamadi cut off some leaves and small branches as well.
 When we returned to his house and stripped the limbs of bark, Mamadi's
wife Sira brewed the leaves and branches into a tea.  I am a tea drinker
in general, but I was somewhat wary of bush teas, as many of them that I had
tried tended to have an unpleasant, medicinal taste.  This, however, was
mellow and sweet, and I drank the cup down pretty quickly.  After that, I
regularly harvested kinkilibaa for myself, as well as drinking it with my
friends and host family for special occasions, such as Ramadan and Eid-al-Adha. 
Since returning to
the states, I have remained in contact with my friends in Barrow Kunda, and I
have been thinking about kinkilibaa as a commercial product for some time.
 After spending a couple years thinking about it, I decided it was time
take a shot at bringing this product to the states in the hopes of establishing
another commodity for trade with The Gambia (with regular availability of the
tea for myself being an extra perk). 
    
What are we going to do with
the money that you donate?
The money will go
towards two things: first funding the initial trip to The Gambia to communicate with
village leaders. This is vital to the success of the project, as social expectations in
The Gambia mandate that you must seek proper permissions before doing business.  During the trip we will also set up some basic infrastructure, and finding the best, least expensive
transport routes. Second, the money will be used for packaging and an advertising campaign here in Madison.
If we don't reach our
funding goal, we will still use the funds we receive to try to work the shipping out remotely with the contacts
we have on the ground in The Gambia.  However, for cultural and logistical reasons,
doing the negotiations and planning on site is preferable. 
What is the final result?
Simple.  You get
continued access to a great new tea product, and the members of the Barrow
Kunda collective get a new opportunity to make money, making everyone's lives
better.  If the project continues to be successful, will expand operations in the US and set up other
cooperatives in The Gambia, and maybe even Senegal.

project with anyone who is interested.

<p>Great news for our <i>Recovery through Recreation </i>campaign!
Two of Hillsides most ardent champions of creating lasting change in the lives
of children, Tori and Al Mordecai, have agreed to support the campaign by
<b>matching all funds up to $2,500</b>. Help support the cause, and remember any
contribution you make will be matched dollar for dollar by the Mordecai family.
<b>Spread the word and share with your friends and family.</b></p>
<p>Hillsides is a 501(c) (3) non-profit dedicated to improving
the overall well-being and functioning of vulnerable children, youth, and their
families. Our vision is to create lasting change in the lives of the children
and youth we serve.</p>
<p> At Hillsides we take
pride in developing and implementing programs that give our children
increased chances at stability, happiness, and an improved quality of life both
now and in the future. </p>
<p>The children in our Residential Treatment Services at Hillsides
come from backgrounds of extreme poverty, neglect, and trauma. These factors
affect the children in adverse ways, ranging from a lack of empathy and social
skills to an inability to express emotions in an appropriate manner. </p>
<p>All children have developmental needs that when met increase
their chances for success and happiness. Sadly, our children come from
backgrounds where these needs were not met. As a result they have started their
lives at a developmental deficit.  It is
our job to do everything that we can to improve their lives, both in the short
and long term.</p>
<p>This project will enable us to help meet the developmental needs
of the children by giving them structure and limits as well as having them
engage in positive social interactions with staff and peers in a safe,
controlled environment. Adding games, equipment, and entertainment features to
our bare-bones recreation center will enable us to develop incentive programs
tailored to meet the specific needs of each individual child.  It will also increase the children’s physical
activity and help them gain a sense of competence and achievement.  Mastering new physical challenges will lead
to increased self-esteem, self-concept, and confidence. As children experiment
with their successes and failures, they learn to trust themselves and others.  </p>
<p>That is why we are asking for your help in equipping our
recreation center. This is one step in helping us confront various issues
affecting our children, ranging from obesity and low self-esteem to
behavioral and developmental challenges. In building up our recreation center, we
will have an added tool to use in the children's therapeutic rehabilitation.</p>
<p>By contributing to our campaign, you will have a direct and
profound impact on the development and improvement of all at-risk youth under
our care. Ultimately, your contributions to our Indiegogo campaign will benefit
not only the children and their families but be a net positive for society as a
whole.  </p>
<p>Helping us fund this project will be helping us build better
tomorrows.</p>
<p>Our funding goal is $5,000. Below is the breakdown of where the
money will be going.</p>

<h3>UPDATES: As of October 2014, we have successfully donated 25 laptops!</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Who We Are and What We Do</h3>
<p>TechBridge is entirely student run. We are a high school volunteer group in the San Francisco Bay Area. Our mission is simple: to equip highly motivated foster children with computer hardware to help them pursue higher education and employment opportunities. This all began with our founder, Jennifer Kao, who is now a sophomore at University of California, Berkeley.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You might wonder why a group of high school kids want to help children. Nowadays, most schools require the use of computers for homework, like projects and essays. We know. We want to help students from low-income families and communities that don’t have access to computers because we know how hard it is to keep up with school and homework without one. </p>
<p>Additionally, we found that it was easier for foster youth to stay connected and find more opportunities if they had access and knew at least the basics with things like Word Doc, PowerPoint and Email. This would help level out the inequality and provide foster youth with more options and equal opportunity to further their educational or occupational career.</p>
<p>Each week, we have student volunteers come in to help out at Green Citizen. GreenCitizen is an eco-waste center that recycles electronic items in the United States under stringent environmental and health regulations. The hours we earn go toward donating laptops to the foster youth in our area.</p>We’ve also organized events to connect with foster youth. An Easter InnVision (a shelter home in South San Francisco) event was held where we were able to donate toys and stationary to children there. But, more importantly, it was inspiring to play with the children there and see them have fun.</span></span><div>

<p>Why, with the volunteer hours, do we still need funding? Other than funds that will go toward more events where we can connect with foster youth, we are also trying to expand our horizons. Recently, we have started to partner up with a local grade school with children who have virtually no access to technology and are new immigrants here in the Bay Area. We want to provide these children with Raspberry Pi(s), which are small computer boards that are relatively inexpensive. However, these smart, small devices require peripherals that need to be accounted for as well. Your contributions will go directly towards these two projects.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>So, What Happens?</h3>
<p>Each part of your donation will go towards supporting our new project as well as events such as our Easter InnVision event this coming Spring (May 2015). Your donation will also go towards setting up a new computer lab at a local school with tablets and Raspberry Pi(s) to get the kids there oriented with technology. Every little sum counts and would immensely help us in expanding our horizons and connecting with our community. We hope that in doing so, we are able to provide equal opportunities to future workers and job hunters with skills necessary to succeed.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>How (Else) You Could Support Us</h3>
<p>Thank you for reviewing our campaign, and we hope you support us even by making a donation. </p>
<p>Other ways you could get involved in bridging the technological divide would be to spread the word about our volunteer group and, if your teen lives in the Bay Area, they could help out as a volunteer, too!

<h3>Hello Everyone!</h3>
<p>For those who know me I am not one to readily ask for anything, almost ever, but this is something that would be of good use to me and I really need. Right now I'm using two laptops which are currently not mine, which is working but not the best situation since both laptops are always also needed by their owners. </p>
<p>Also, as many of you know, I'm leaping into an endeavor to start my own business in the e-commerce sector, namely lingerie. yes, I know, I don't exactly exude sex appeal, but I believe lingerie just isn't about that. I'm very excited to delve into this and the other millions of things I would love to do with life, but its becoming more and more difficult without having my own laptop.</p>
<p>Since my birthday is coming up really soon (October 4), any contribution towards this gift would mean the world to me! </p>
<p>Now I do feel weird making this all about me, so I've decided that whatever amount made above the goal amount all will go to an organization I've been volunteering with, Room to Grow. I have seen first hand how they are helping low income parents help their children by providing social services, books, clothing, and baby items during the first 3 years of the baby's life. </p>
<p>I ESPECIALLY love that they give each child at least 6-7 books every appointment until the child leaves, giving that child about 130 books by the time he/she graduates from the program! Check them out at <a href=""http://www.roomtogrow.org."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.roomtogrow.org.</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What Is Needed: </h3>
<p>So with the amount raised this is what I would receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>MacBook Pro </li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Software for daily and professional use (i.e. Microsoft Office, Adobe CS6)</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Printer</span></li>
<li>AppleCare Protection Plan </li>
<li>Indiegogo fees.</li>
<li>If the goal is not reached, whatever is reached will still go towards the laptop. Everyone will still get updates on when the laptop is purchased and pics! Again any money made above the goal will be given to Room to Grow (minus Indiegogo fees).</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">You would all receive my undying gratitude if this happens!</span></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With a new laptop, I would be able to put in more hours and be more efficient at what I am doing. Hopefully sooner than later you would be able to see the fruits of my work.</p>
<p>Thank you for helping my birthday be the best! </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Thank You!</h3>

Right now I'm using two laptops which are currently not mine, which is working but not the best situation since both laptops are always also needed by their owners. 
Also, as many of you know, I'm leaping into an endeavor to start my own business in the e-commerce sector, namely lingerie. yes, I know, I don't exactly exude sex appeal, but I believe lingerie just isn't about that. I'm very excited to delve into this and the other millions of things I would love to do with life, but its becoming more and more difficult without having my own laptop.
Since my birthday is coming up really soon (October 4), any contribution towards this gift would mean the world to me! 
Now I do feel weird making this all about me, so I've decided that whatever amount made above the goal amount all will go to an organization I've been volunteering with, Room to Grow. I have seen first hand how they are helping low income parents help their children by providing social services, books, clothing, and baby items during the first 3 years of the baby's life. 
I ESPECIALLY love that they give each child at least 6-7 books every appointment until the child leaves, giving that child about 130 books by the time he/she graduates from the program! Check them out at www.roomtogrow.org.


What Is Needed: 
So with the amount raised this is what I would receive:

MacBook Pro 
Software for daily and professional use (i.e. Microsoft Office, Adobe CS6)
Printer
AppleCare Protection Plan 
Indiegogo fees.
If the goal is not reached, whatever is reached will still go towards the laptop. Everyone will still get updates on when the laptop is purchased and pics! Again any money made above the goal will be given to Room to Grow (minus Indiegogo fees).
You would all receive my undying gratitude if this happens!



The Impact
With a new laptop, I would be able to put in more hours and be more efficient at what I am doing. Hopefully sooner than later you would be able to see the fruits of my work.
Thank you for helping my birthday be the best! 


Thank You!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Help Yeyo and Aerin go to Giftival<br/>
</h3>Your dear friends, Aerin Dunford and Sergio Beltrán (aka ""the Yeyo"") have been invited to participate in GIFTIVAL, an incredible gathering of friends and practitioners of <i>gift culture</i>. The event takes place in just one month, from October 11 - 14th in Istanbul, Turkey. <br/><br/>Here's a brief summary of the encounter: <br/><br/>GIFTIVAL is a 5-day collective inquiry/gathering/festival for visionaries and practitioners from around the world exploring new economies and gift 
culture. 
Those of us who are committed to living in and bringing forth a gifting 
paradigm believe it is 
time for us to celebrate our work, to share our stories and to deepen 
our learning and understanding of the gift and its place for us. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/74643/files/20130914192418-Giftival.jpg?1379211858"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

In an effort to meet this demand and expand the regional food system, Food Roots is preparing to embark on our most ambitious project yet: North Coast Grown. This program will increase specialty crop production here on the North Coast by providing local farmers and farm workers with education, networking, and a suite of tools to both increase sales and production for existing farmers and to help establish new farms.<br/><br/>The core of North Coast Grown—and the crucial first step of the program—resides in the construction and use of three 30' x 96' High Tunnel Hoop Houses. These three hoop houses will provide nearly 9,000 square feet of indoor growing space. This space will be available to local farmers, will increase year-round production of fresh, local fruits and vegetables, and will provide a demonstration and training site for new and existing farmers. In the long term, these hoop houses will serve as the base upon which we plan to build a local farm incubator program.<br/><br/>Construction of these hoop houses will cost $78,000 in total. However, due to strong community and institutional support, we already have $71,000 of the funds committed. All we need from you is the final $7,000 in matching funds that will make this entire project happen. With the $7,000 we plan to raise via this campaign, we'll be able to release the additional $71,000 in funding from our various partners, build three High Tunnel Hoop Houses, and begin to implement the ambitious North Coast Grown project.<p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/237861/files/20131202164439-peacecrops.jpg?1386031479"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><h3>North Coast Grown: The Full Details<br/>
</h3>
<p></p>Of course, building the hoop houses is just the critical first step of the entire North Coast Grown project. The $7,000 we raise here, in other words, will not just build these three hoop houses, but will initiate the entire, 21-month North Coast Grown project, which is budgeted at approximately $240,000 and includes the $78,000 to build the hoop houses, a $99,997 grant via the United States Department of Agriculture Specialty Crop Block Grant Program, and support and funding from Food Roots, the Port of Tillamook Bay, and a variety of other local and regional community partners. What that means is that, if we can raise just $7,000 during this campaign, we'll be able to implement a nearly quarter million dollar project to grow and support the regional food system along the North Coast of Oregon.<br/><br/>How will this work? Well, during its initial 21-month phase, North Coast Grown will increase <a href=""http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/ams.fetchTemplateData.do?template=TemplateJ&amp;navID=WhatareSpecialtyCrops?&amp;rightNav1=WhatareSpecialtyCrops?&amp;topNav=&amp;leftNav=&amp;page=SCBGPDefinitions&amp;resultType=&amp;acct=fvgrntprg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">specialty crop</a> production—specifically, fresh fruits, vegetables, and medicinal and culinary herbs—here on the North Coast by providing local farmers and farm workers with a number of new tools and support programs, including:<br/><br/><ul>

<p>The North Coast Grown project is an incredible opportunity and a chance to make a huge impact with a comparatively small contribution. Once we've raised $7,000 in matching funds, we can release the additional $71,000 to build the three High Tunnel Hoop Houses. Once we've built those hoop houses, we will be able to implement the full, $240,000 North Coast Grown program. In other words, if we can raise $7,000 here, we'll leverage it to implement a 21-month, $240,000 project that will significantly support and grow the local food system here on the North Coast of Oregon—and that, ultimately, we will work to build into a local farm incubator program. We can essentially multiply your contribution 30+ times over. But we can only do that if we receive your contribution in the first place. We're not asking you to fund this entire program. We already have an incredible amount of community support and committed dollars. All we're asking is for that final amount to push us over the edge, release over $200,000 in additional funding and support, and begin to provide a wealth of tools and assistance to our current and future farmers here on the North Coast.<br/></p><p>To contribute, click the red ""Contribute Now"" button at the bottom of this page.

Her husband works in construction, and has for quite a number of years. He lost his job about 4 months ago, and was forced to find another job - as you may know, Calgary isn't the most job booming city right now, and especially not at this time. As a result, he was forced to accept a job that would require him to be away from home, in Regina, A LOT of the time, I mean 3 or 4 weeks out of the month, not only is this hard on him - but even harder for my sister to raise the baby alone and not have her partner there with her each and every night. In an effort to hopefully change this as it had become too much for my sister to bear, he was able to get on a job for the same company but in Edmonton. Well Edmonton is at least in Alberta, and isn't too far from Calgary - so they decided they would make the move to Edmonton from Calgary as they could be together every night, and he would be able to see his son everyday. My sister was ecstatic - this is what she had dreamed of for years since he started working Construction, to be able to see him every single night like most couples. <br/></p><p>They began searching for a house in Edmonton at the begging of May when they decided to make the big move. They searched and searched and had troubles finding a house within their price range that was large enough for them, when finally they came across one house - it was perfect, the perfect size, a new area, fairly new and affordable! The only problem was they wanted a short term tenant. After my sister got into contact with the ""homeowners"", and explained the situation asking if they would be willing to sign a longer term lease (as they were looking for 1 or 2 month terms), they had agreed as they were expecting a child and thought it would be easier to have a long term tenant rather than a short term tenant. Because my sisters husband works away, he was away working with the vehicle and my sister was organizing the move while he was working - she was unable to actually go and see the place physically. The landlords sent lots of pictures, we had looked at it on google street view, and it was a very nice house. The ""landlords"" then contacted my sister saying they had ended up in the hospital with complications in the pregnancy but were released - and had an appt in Calgary in the coming days and brought up the idea that they could meet for coffee to exchange the keys when they came to Calgary. Everything about this seemed to legit, and real. They then sent a lease to my sister and asked her to sign it, return it, and they would sign it and return it to her as well with both signatures - and to also email transfer her the damage deposit (2100$) so they would guarantee it was theirs and begin making moving plans. So she did. <br/></p><p>She sent it all, signed and everything. She had still kept in contact with my sister following this - but never returned the signed lease. They were supposed to gain possession of the house on May 22, 2014 and gave notice to their current landlords that they would be leaving the 22nd of May, and had theirs utilities shut off for that day as well. Everything was a go, until the night of May 21st - they received an email from the ""landlords"" saying the basement sump had flooded and renovations needed to be completed before they could move and gave them a new possession date of June 1, 2014. They still loaded everything into a trailer, and sent it to Edmonton to sit until moving day, as they had to leave their current home. Since that night, they have had no communication with the supposed ""landlords"" and all attempts to communicate have failed. My sister had a friend whom lives in Edmonton go to the address they were given, and knock on the door to see who was there, if anyone. To her surprise, an elderly women answered the door. She explained to the lady what was going on, and what had happened and that their address is being given out and someone is supposed to move in. She had absolutely no idea about it, and said they have lived there for a few years and had no intentions on moving.</p><p>This is when we realized it was all a scam. My sister and her family are now lost, scared and worried. They have an almost 2 year old son who needs a stable home to be in, and they need the comfort of a home. Right now, they are couch surfing as they are stranded with no money, and no home.</p><p>It is truly disgusting, and sickening to think there is people in this world who will go through such lengths, and cause so much sorrow in someones life simply because they cannot contribute by working or other means.

My sister, and her family (her husband and (almost) 2 year old son) have lived in Calgary for a few years as well as myself. Her husband works in construction, and has for quite a number of years. He lost his job about 4 months ago, and was forced to find another job - as you may know, Calgary isn't the most job booming city right now, and especially not at this time. As a result, he was forced to accept a job that would require him to be away from home, in Regina, A LOT of the time, I mean 3 or 4 weeks out of the month, not only is this hard on him - but even harder for my sister to raise the baby alone and not have her partner there with her each and every night. In an effort to hopefully change this as it had become too much for my sister to bear, he was able to get on a job for the same company but in Edmonton. Well Edmonton is at least in Alberta, and isn't too far from Calgary - so they decided they would make the move to Edmonton from Calgary as they could be together every night, and he would be able to see his son everyday. My sister was ecstatic - this is what she had dreamed of for years since he started working Construction, to be able to see him every single night like most couples. They began searching for a house in Edmonton at the begging of May when they decided to make the big move. They searched and searched and had troubles finding a house within their price range that was large enough for them, when finally they came across one house - it was perfect, the perfect size, a new area, fairly new and affordable! The only problem was they wanted a short term tenant. After my sister got into contact with the ""homeowners"", and explained the situation asking if they would be willing to sign a longer term lease (as they were looking for 1 or 2 month terms), they had agreed as they were expecting a child and thought it would be easier to have a long term tenant rather than a short term tenant. Because my sisters husband works away, he was away working with the vehicle and my sister was organizing the move while he was working - she was unable to actually go and see the place physically. The landlords sent lots of pictures, we had looked at it on google street view, and it was a very nice house. The ""landlords"" then contacted my sister saying they had ended up in the hospital with complications in the pregnancy but were released - and had an appt in Calgary in the coming days and brought up the idea that they could meet for coffee to exchange the keys when they came to Calgary. Everything about this seemed to legit, and real. They then sent a lease to my sister and asked her to sign it, return it, and they would sign it and return it to her as well with both signatures - and to also email transfer her the damage deposit (2100$) so they would guarantee it was theirs and begin making moving plans. So she did. She sent it all, signed and everything. She had still kept in contact with my sister following this - but never returned the signed lease. They were supposed to gain possession of the house on May 22, 2014 and gave notice to their current landlords that they would be leaving the 22nd of May, and had theirs utilities shut off for that day as well. Everything was a go, until the night of May 21st - they received an email from the ""landlords"" saying the basement sump had flooded and renovations needed to be completed before they could move and gave them a new possession date of June 1, 2014. They still loaded everything into a trailer, and sent it to Edmonton to sit until moving day, as they had to leave their current home. Since that night, they have had no communication with the supposed ""landlords"" and all attempts to communicate have failed. My sister had a friend whom lives in Edmonton go to the address they were given, and knock on the door to see who was there, if anyone. To her surprise, an elderly women answered the door. She explained to the lady what was going on, and what had happened and that their address is being given out and someone is supposed to move in. She had absolutely no idea about it, and said they have lived there for a few years and had no intentions on moving.This is when we realized it was all a scam. My sister and her family are now lost, scared and worried. They have an almost 2 year old son who needs a stable home to be in, and they need the comfort of a home. Right now, they are couch surfing as they are stranded with no money, and no home.It is truly disgusting, and sickening to think there is people in this world who will go through such lengths, and cause so much sorrow in someones life simply because they cannot contribute by working or other means. It is so sad. I'm just a student myself, our parents do not have a lot of money - and we feel so trapped. We are in this together, we're family.By contributing to reaching this 4,000$ goal, you would be changing their life - seriously. I would be forever grateful, as would they. This money will strictly be put towards a damage deposit towards a new home, and the first months rent at a new home so they are able to get back on their feet and provide all the love and care their little boy, and my nephew needs. I realize we all live paycheck to paycheck in this crazy world, but anything will help. And again, thank you so much - from the bottom of my heart.Dylan ForsethWhat We Need & What You GetI am aiming to raise a total of 4,000$ CAD.

<p></p>
<p>Our twin primate boys are our inspiration and the four of us are working hard to bring you the BEST craft beer in Northern VA. </p>
<p>Here's how <b>YOU</b>
 can join our primate family: Because we're self-funding our nano 
brewery, we really need you to join our primate family with a pledge. 
Each pledge will bring us closer to our 1st goal of $15K.  The more 
people you can recruit to join our family, the faster we can <i>zooooom</i>
 from $15K to our ambitious $100K goal.  We're a bit ambitious, but the more
 pledges we receive, the more craft beer we'll be able to brew for you. 
 Here's how the Twinpanzee Brewing Co plans will change as we hit each 
of our goals:</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">**** Current Donation Level ****<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/788907/files/20140814181730-Beer_Contribution_Levls.jpg?1408065450"" src="""" style=""""/></p></figure>
</h3>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><figcaption>Join our primate family so we can zoom to $100K! This picture will change as we get closer to each goal.</figcaption></figure><p></p>
<h3><b>Goal #1 - $15K</b></h3>
<p>Reaching our first goal will mean that 
we will be able to build out and open our nano brewery with a 1.5 barrel
 brewing system and 2-3 fermenters.  Due to the small size and limited 
funding, our tasting room will be open only one day a week.  Although 
$15K is a great starting point, we're confident that as more VA craft 
beer fans join our primate family we will move far beyond this first 
goal.  At this point the head primate will send all members of our 
primate family a handwritten ""Thank You"" note and will add all primate 
family members to a list where you'll be part of special offers, 
discounts and ""family only"" events.</p>
<h1><b><h3><b>Goal #2 - $50K</b></h3></b></h1>
<p>$50K
 will allow us to open our tasting room for a total of two days a week 
as the extra funds would allow us to purchase additional fermenters, 
brite tanks and kegs to increase our capacity.  We would continue using 
the 1.5 barrel brewing system and would brew everyday to keep up with 
the increased demand (because you will <i>loooove</i> our beer!).  Upon hitting the $50K mark, the head primate will do a happy dance and will: <br/>- Send out hand written ""Thank You"" notes to members of our primate family<br/>- Create a special ""thank you"" video for primate family members<br/>- Share two (2) of our favorite all-grain recipes to brew your own Twinpanzee brew<br/>- Add all primate family members to a list where you'll be part of special offers, discounts and ""family only"" events.</p>
<h1><b><h3><b>Goal #3 - $75K</b></h3></b></h1>
<p>Reaching
 the $75K mark would ensure that we could comfortably open our tasting 
room at least three days a week and supply enough beer to all our 
thirsty patrons. The additional funds would allow us to purchase larger 
fermenters (3 BBL) for brewing double batches on our 1.5 BBL system.  
The additional fermenters would also allow us to brew some Triples or 
Lagers which require longer fermentation time. When we hit the $75K 
goal, the entire primate family will do a happy dance and the head 
primate will:<br/>- Send out hand written ""Thank You"" notes to all members of our primate family
<br/>- Create a special ""thank you"" video for primate family members<br/>- Share a total of three (3) all-grain recipes to brew your own Twinpanzee brew<br/>- Add all primate family members to a list where you'll be part of special offers, discounts and ""family only"" events.</p>
<h3><b>Goal #4 - $100K (and beyond!)</b></h3>
<p>If
 we're able to zoom past the $100K goal, we would be able to purchase a 
larger 6BBL brewing system, larger 6 BBL fermenters and could open our 
tasting room for more than four days a week.  You would be helping us 
jump into the big leagues as our brewing capacity would allow for local 
distribution via kegs and cans.  We're confident you will get us to this
 goal so that we can bring Twinpanzee Brewing Co beer to thirsty patrons
 outside of the Northern VA area.  Heck, after we reach the $100K goal 
the Head Primate has volunteered to:<br/>- Shave his head and include a 
picture of his cue ball head with a hand written ""Thank You"" note to all
 members of our primate family
<br/>- Create a special ""thank you"" video for primate family members
<br/>- Share a total of five (5) all-grain recipes to brew your own Twinpanzee brew<br/>- Add all primate family members to a list where you'll be part of special offers, discounts and ""family only"" events.</p>
<p>We also have a ton of GREAT rewards for your donations.  Please see the <b>REWARDS</b> area below for pictures and for more information.</p>

Risks & Challenges

 
Laws, licenses, permits...oh my! As we continue to move forward in planning our brewery, we've found that one of the most challenging aspects of starting a brewery (regardless of the size) is obtaining the proper permits, licenses and dealing with the many laws.
Breweries are closely monitored and heavily regulated at both the state and federal level. In addition to the normal business licenses and permits required of everyone in Virginia, we also must meet the requirements of Federal TTB (formerly ATF) and the ABC of Virginia.
If that wasn't enough, the amount of time it takes to obtain all the necessary permits and licenses are astounding. Imagine paying a monthly lease and not being able to open your doors to the public and sell your brews until you have the right license/permits. We're at the mercy of our state and federal government but will do our due diligence to ensure all of our requests are in order to expedite processing.

<p>During my career, I have traveled the globe in a wheelchair but have encountered about every accessibility issue imaginable: multiple steps at the front door, restrooms that are not accessible, properties located on dangerously steep streets, historic buildings which are not
accessible, and the dreaded small hydraulic lifts that half the time don’t work. Today, many hotels, restaurants,
cruise ships and city attractions say they are accessible or ADA compliant, but
it’s just not so. Our government’s definition of “ADA Compliant” is over 25
years old, and believe me, needs an upgrade!</p>

Our strategy has been to build a database, a wheelchair accessibility index and a unique user-friendly website with detailed
accessibility reviews on thousands of facilities worldwide. We advise wheelchair travelers which hotels, restaurants, cruise ships, city
attractions and mass transportation are wheelchair friendly and <b>importantly</b>
which <b><i>properties to</i> <i>avoid</i></b>. <p></p><p>
<b>At this point we have created the engine and
processes but we still need to build out the content management platform,

The wheelchair community needs a trusted name in

As part of our travel database methodology, we
interview 100% of the facilities on our website and have to date interviewed
over 1,000 hotels, restaurants, cruise ships and city attractions in 8 major U.S. cities and the country of New Zealand.

Hi: I’m Jim Parsons founder of WheelchairJimmy.com and the
WheelchairJimmy YouTube Channel. I created the website to improve the
lifestyles and travel opportunities for persons with disabilities. We have created a unique travel advisory website geared to make disabled travel more fun, accessible, convenient and hassle free.
During my career, I have traveled the globe in a wheelchair but have encountered about every accessibility issue imaginable: multiple steps at the front door, restrooms that are not accessible, properties located on dangerously steep streets, historic buildings which are not
accessible, and the dreaded small hydraulic lifts that half the time don’t work. Today, many hotels, restaurants,
cruise ships and city attractions say they are accessible or ADA compliant, but
it’s just not so. Our government’s definition of “ADA Compliant” is over 25
years old, and believe me, needs an upgrade!

Our strategy has been to build a database, a wheelchair accessibility index and a unique user-friendly website with detailed
accessibility reviews on thousands of facilities worldwide. We advise wheelchair travelers which hotels, restaurants, cruise ships, city
attractions and mass transportation are wheelchair friendly and importantly
which properties to avoid. 
At this point we have created the engine and
processes but we still need to build out the content management platform,
extend our digital technology initiatives including data driven interactivity, mobile and tablet
usability and add new cities. To accomplish our goals we need your help, donations and support. 
The wheelchair community needs a trusted name in
accessible travel. 
Together we can make the world more fun and
accessible!
Our Needs and Your Sponsorship
As part of our travel database methodology, we
interview 100% of the facilities on our website and have to date interviewed
over 1,000 hotels, restaurants, cruise ships and city attractions in 8 major U.S. cities and the country of New Zealand. To better ""scale"" the project, we  need to extend our development team to enhance our dynamic content management platform. This will allow both internal resources and consumer travelers, via crowd sourcing, to upload images, reviews and content while we expand

Our Business Strategy

Develop
the WheelchairJimmy Brand Name as the Most Trusted Name for Disabled Travel:
Over the next several years we intend to actively develop strategic
relationships to generate revenue with multiple hotels, restaurants, city
attractions and cruise ship owners to build our brand name.


Develop a
Dynamic Social Networking Site for the Disabled and Build Content: We
anticipate building our community by providing substantive content on relevant
topics about living life with a disability.


Expand the
Database of Hotels, Restaurants, City Attractions, Cruise Ships and Mass Transit: We believe today’s technology can be used to build and manage a
comprehensive, scalable, accessible database relatively quickly and
inexpensively.


Develop
the WheelchairJimmy.com Mobile App: This will be coordinated with engineering our website content management platform.


Generate
Ad Revenues from our Website and Mobile App: We believe there are
numerous product placement and licensing opportunities relating to the disabled community and
increasingly older demographic marketplace. We have already created revenue sharing affiliation agreements with Hilton Hotels, Intercontinental Hotels (Holiday Inn et al) and CityPass (city attractions).

TIMELINE AND BUDGETWe have created the engine, look, feel and functionality for our website but we still need to build out the content management platform and extend our digital technology initiatives. So first and foremost we will make our website ""efficient and scaleable"". We also need to upload the remaining cities we have interviewed, expand coverage to new
cities and add a crowd sourcing feature. Here's our 4-year timeline:As we expand to new cities and add content, we'll need to expand the WheelchairJimmy Militia, expand the revenue base by securing strategic marketing and licensing partners and raise additional capital.

</li>
</ul><p><b>THE FREELANCE ONLINE EMPLOYMENT SERVICES COMPETITION</b></p><p>The online freelance employment industry has developed rapidly in the past decade. General freelance marketplaces are now the largest platforms. As the industry’s first movers, these marketplaces established brand recognition, grew their user base and made many acquisitions. Job Advocate will compete in this segment but will offer added features and focus on job categories that its competitors do not.</p><p><strong>COMPETITIVE</strong> <b>ADVANTAGE</b><br/>Advantage #1</p><p>Innovative prediction and matching technology that will use algorithms and metatags to create convenience and save time and money for both parties.</p><p>Advantage #2</p><p>Job Advocate will focus on unmet needs in employer demand. This will mean recruiting freelancers with a focus in such professional skills as finance,  accounting, management and marketing. These are underserved markets on competitor sites.</p><p>Advantage #3</p><p>Resource center that attracts and aids freelancers in starting and operating their businesses.</p><p> </p><p><b>HOW IT WORKS</b></p><p>Job Advocate will enlist both employer and freelancers on its marketplace platform. Job Advocate will be a full-service marketplace and its technology will offer added benefits such as talent screening and matching, which will be an added convenience for employers and freelancers. This will also help Job Advocate to combat information asymmetry, which is prevalent in existing services.</p><p>The Job Advocate platform will be the “middle man” for each job posting and consequent hiring. Communication, work and invoicing will all be stored through the company’s cloud-based storage system. In addition to finding contract work, freelancers will have access to a resource center, which will host legal resources, tax advisory, benefit services, payment services, a personal coach resource, and more. It is Job Advocate’s goal to partner freelancers so that they may become independent, productive, educated, and aware of their job market value.  </p><p> </p><p><b>TARGET INDUSTRIES</b></p><p>Job Advocate will open its marketplace to many types of freelancers, but with a focus on skilled and licensed professionals. While its largest competitors (Elance, Freelancer and oDesk) are known to primarily emphasize IT, software development and design and multi-media, Job Advocate will focus on the future of freelance business—white collar workers. </p><p> 37% of job postings on Elance come from the industry segment of IT and Programming, while only 2% comes from finance and management. This is in disparity to the demand in the market. The Global Skills in Demand chart shows that 88% of companies are looking for skilled workers in the area of finance and management, followed by sales and marketing. Job Advocate will focus on enrolling users who meet the criteria demanded by the market. </p><p>In today’s world, more and more traditional workers are turning to freelancing due to the limited available jobs, the independence and quality of life brought on by freelancing, and the ability to control how much money is charged per job. Job Advocate believes that it can locate and convert these ready and available skilled workers and create an in-demand freelance marketplace.</p><p><br/><b>WHO ARE FREELANCERS?</b></p><p>The number of freelance workers in the US is rapidly growing. A 2010 Intuit survey projects that more than 40 percent of the U.S. workforce would be contingent workers by 2020. More recently, a lobbying group called It’s My Business estimated there are 10.3 million independent contractors working in the U.S. today. Freelancers Union, meanwhile, says 42 million workers, or one-third of the current US labor-force are already freelancers.</p><p>These freelancers come from many different backgrounds and are looking for flexibility and freedom in their work. Following the recent economic downturn, the employment rate has recovered at a frustratingly slow pace, except in one area: temporary, contingent, and independent workers. Between 2009 and 2012, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of temporary employees rose by 29%. During the labor market crash of 2008, many previous full-time employees became freelancers out of necessity before realizing the benefits that come along with being independent. A glimpse into the mind of this target market can be seen to the right.</p><p> </p><p><b>COMPANIES HIRING FREELANCERS</b></p><p>Companies of all sizes and industries are now hiring freelance workers. As can be seen on the previous page, companies are now looking to contract out more professional and licensed services such as finance and management. These skills apply to all types of businesses.</p><p>While in the past freelancers have focused on marketing their services to penny-pinching start ups and SMBs, today more and more large corporations with higher budgets are entering into the marketplace. They are looking for experienced professionals for contract work in order to limit payroll while completing projects in a timely manner. </p><p>42% of employers said they anticipate hiring more freelancers in 2014 than the previous year.</p><p>It is projected that by 2020, freelancers could make up 50%of the full time work force.</p><p>Employers are demanding more white collar, professional freelancers.</p><p> </p><p><strong>ONGOING MARKETING STRATEGY</strong></p><p>Once Job Advocate is fully operation and competing within the market, it will implement a continued marketing strategy. This strategy will  involve traditional media, events and networking, online advertising and social media marketing.</p><p> </p><p><b>USER ACQUISITION</b></p><p>Job Advocate will use its sales and marketing plan to acquire new users. In year 1, the website will enroll over 40,000 freelancers and over 16,000 employers. This will increase to a total of  2.5 million freelancers in year 5 and over 400,000 employers.</p><p>The average employer will post 5 jobs per year by year 5, and an average of 40% of posted jobs will be awarded. These numbers are more conservative than industry standard for the sake of proper risk planning in the business plan.</p><p><br/><b>FINANCIAL SUMMARY</b></p><p>Job Advocate is targeting significant growth over the next several years, and is seeking an investment of $500,000 to support this growth. The company is searching for investment partners in order to bring the platform to market and support the company's growth plan, vision and management style. </p><p>The majority of funds raised will go directly to driving the completion and launch of version 1.0, and early customer acquisition and  development.</p><p><br/></p><p>

While its largest competitors (Elance, Freelancer and oDesk) are known to primarily emphasize IT, software development and design and multi-media, Job Advocate will focus on the future of freelance business—white collar workers.  37% of job postings on Elance come from the industry segment of IT and Programming, while only 2% comes from finance and management. This is in disparity to the demand in the market. The Global Skills in Demand chart shows that 88% of companies are looking for skilled workers in the area of finance and management, followed by sales and marketing. Job Advocate will focus on enrolling users who meet the criteria demanded by the market. In today’s world, more and more traditional workers are turning to freelancing due to the limited available jobs, the independence and quality of life brought on by freelancing, and the ability to control how much money is charged per job. Job Advocate believes that it can locate and convert these ready and available skilled workers and create an in-demand freelance marketplace.WHO ARE FREELANCERS?The number of freelance workers in the US is rapidly growing. A 2010 Intuit survey projects that more than 40 percent of the U.S. workforce would be contingent workers by 2020. More recently, a lobbying group called It’s My Business estimated there are 10.3 million independent contractors working in the U.S. today. Freelancers Union, meanwhile, says 42 million workers, or one-third of the current US labor-force are already freelancers.These freelancers come from many different backgrounds and are looking for flexibility and freedom in their work. Following the recent economic downturn, the employment rate has recovered at a frustratingly slow pace, except in one area: temporary, contingent, and independent workers. Between 2009 and 2012, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of temporary employees rose by 29%. During the labor market crash of 2008, many previous full-time employees became freelancers out of necessity before realizing the benefits that come along with being independent. A glimpse into the mind of this target market can be seen to the right. COMPANIES HIRING FREELANCERSCompanies of all sizes and industries are now hiring freelance workers. As can be seen on the previous page, companies are now looking to contract out more professional and licensed services such as finance and management. These skills apply to all types of businesses.While in the past freelancers have focused on marketing their services to penny-pinching start ups and SMBs, today more and more large corporations with higher budgets are entering into the marketplace. They are looking for experienced professionals for contract work in order to limit payroll while completing projects in a timely manner. 42% of employers said they anticipate hiring more freelancers in 2014 than the previous year.It is projected that by 2020, freelancers could make up 50%of the full time work force.Employers are demanding more white collar, professional freelancers. ONGOING MARKETING STRATEGYOnce Job Advocate is fully operation and competing within the market, it will implement a continued marketing strategy. This strategy will  involve traditional media, events and networking, online advertising and social media marketing. USER ACQUISITIONJob Advocate will use its sales and marketing plan to acquire new users. In year 1, the website will enroll over 40,000 freelancers and over 16,000 employers. This will increase to a total of  2.5 million freelancers in year 5 and over 400,000 employers.The average employer will post 5 jobs per year by year 5, and an average of 40% of posted jobs will be awarded. These numbers are more conservative than industry standard for the sake of proper risk planning in the business plan.FINANCIAL SUMMARYJob Advocate is targeting significant growth over the next several years, and is seeking an investment of $500,000 to support this growth. The company is searching for investment partners in order to bring the platform to market and support the company's growth plan, vision and management style. The majority of funds raised will go directly to driving the completion and launch of version 1.0, and early customer acquisition and  development.",0.0,2,"1 Campaign

We grew up in Cincinnati, and would love your help in opening a beer bar and growler to-go shop, in Cincinnati. In 2011, we started a small company in downtown Cincinnati called, ‘The Pedal Wagon’ and have been happily running tours for almost 2 years. It’s been an incredible ride, but we’ve had this pesky passion, which we just can’t shake.Last December, with nothing but adventure in mind, we travelled 6429 miles; from home to California, California to New Orleans, New Orleans to New York, New York to home. On our journey, that passion reared it’s gorgeous head.What stood out the most to us was the craft beer industry: an community full of creative, and most notably, passionate people. From there, we set out to create a venue that does them, and their devoted supporters, justice.What is HalfCut, really?:With HalfCut, our number one goal is to offer you the best lineup of local and rare beer in Cincinnati. That goal centers on two customer experiences: ""to-go"" beer, and ""the beer parlor"". No matter what experience you’re looking for, knowledgeable, beer-loving brewistas will help you at the counter, and walk you through the tap list and bottled beer offerings to make sure you find something you love.To-Go: Come inside and indulge in the sampling process, or grab your beer to go at our 12th street pick-up window.Growlers: Using the growler as a container gives you fresh, draft quality craft beer. Take it home, bring it to a party, down it before a business meeting… we don’t judge.Mix-6 Packs: Mix-6 packs offer a tasty spread for the adventurous beer lovers out there.Beer Parlor: Using inspiration from across this wonderful country, we’ve worked to craft the perfect space for you to imbibe. Come in for a couple drinks, and indulge in good conversation, and good company. You may just bump into a tap takeover, beer class, or sampling night. Why HalfCut needs your help:


We want to create a craft beer mecca, which shines light on the local and regional brewers, with you, the beer drinker, on the front of our mind.Revamping a building constructed in 1884 has been full of surprises. Some of those surprises have put us in a position where we may have to compromise our vision. We don’t want to compromise… so here we are! The Fruits of your Labor:
Draft SystemAdvanced direct draw tap and growler fill system.What that means for you:
Your beer stays fresher, longer
Faster fills means less time between you and your beer
Less waste means lower prices
Larger Walk in CoolerDowntown Cincinnati has a limited selection of “to-go” craft beer. Let’s change that…A large walk in cooler means more space for us to fit a wider variety of bottled beer. With a larger cooler, you never have to have the same mix 6 pack or 22oz bomber.GOAT GIFTS FOR YOURSELF / SOMEONE SPECIALShipping DetailsGreater Cincinnati Area: If fully funded, we will deliver all gifts to you home on December 19th or December 20th for just $5.

<p>The
project goal is to empower the community by encouraging peers to become leading
experts in the pressing issues of Mobility, Alternative Energy,
Sustainability/Water and Systematic Approaches to Meeting Community Needs.
 The methane formed from organic is used as a source of synthetic gas to
create energy via biogas technology. This renewable energy source can provide
energy for small town rural communities and replace the need to use fossil
fuels.  Business and S.T.E.M. students will work together to create a
sustainable enterprises capable of funding themselves.  Alongside this objective, we are bringing the
community into the current push for lowering environmental impact.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p><i><b>Students
will work to address specific challenges. What is the problem or issue we are
working to address? Who is our target population?</b></i></p>
<p>With
the project, both the campus and local community are the target
populations.  We intend to spread awareness about the concept of taking a systematic approach to utilizing biogas as a renewable energy source, maintaining environmental health, and economic
profitability.  Building a sustainable community requires efforts in
research and education.  Fortunately, Tuskegee
University can help with these efforts.</p><p>The project will
also meet urgent and unmet community needs in a number of ways.  For the
town of Tuskegee, the price of energy is above average and there is an absence of
job providers.  Thus, the cost of living
is relatively high and residents must travel outside the community to work.
 The project will have a major impact on the community because it can help reduce
the burden of energy costs.</p>
<p></p>
<p><i><b>What
activities will our group undertake?</b></i></p>
<p>To
address the issue of energy cost in the Tuskegee community we have developed a
biogas operation to create methane as an energy source.  The pilot operation is taking place at the
Shady Grove Blueberry Patch.  The collaboration
with this small business meets our needs in regards to supplies and
infrastructure. Its foundation has been in place for decades, starting in
the 80’s.  The current owner has agreed
to allow us access to the property and it’s resources in exchange for help maintaining the blueberry patch.  Our goal is
develop leadership skills in Tuskegee University students as they promote the
use of this green energy throughout the county. </p><p>Planning, decision-making,
communicating, and teamwork are all skills required to be a responsible student
leader.  Even though a student leadership role is a learning experience
without a grade, it is still one of the most beneficial extracurricular
activities.  With our project, participants are able to take on roles just
as they would in a corporate team or on a research project.  Also, this will serve as a chance for our
generation to experience African Americans farms that is continuously decreasing with time and as
economic resources are reallocated to other social groups. </p><br/><p></p>

We are a (South African) National Small Business Support Organisation. Our goals are to connect, support and provide a platform for small businesses and professional sales people - to network and mentor each other in order to grow, prosper and create new business opportunities, and in so doing - create a job for our fellow countrymen and women. 
South Africa currently has an unemployment rate of over 30% Every job we create, every business we save, every client we refer to a small business owner contributes to solving this problem. Our custom developed software links and make this possible - and this is where we need your help. 
As we are in africa - lets describe it like this - How do you eat an elephant?  - Well easy ... one bite at a time - and this is how we tackle unemployment, one new opportunity, one new job created at a time.   What We Need & What You Get We need financial assistance to finalise development our versions 2 & 3 of BizLink - our business referral software 
We have successfully launched our first version of BizLink - but now through experience and user feedback, we wish to launch updated versions with far greater functionality and reach. BizLink delivers personalised referrals to clients and small businesses that need them most - this ensures that SME's stay in business and protect jobs All funds will be utilised to launch version 2 of BizLink
As we are a self funded company - like most small ,businesses our funding is limited.
With your help we can deliver a practical solution to a very real challenge  





The Impact

 All contributors will receive feedback from us at Just Ask and we will publish your profile on our Small Business Hero's wall on our website - whilst we don't produce a tangible ""thing"" we do save families and protect businesses - you can too. 
Your contribution will directly benefit a small business owner & help create or protect a job We currently serve over 250 SME's and are taking on over 5 new business owners a day Please feel free to visit our website ( www.justask.co.za ) and you can verify our credentials with the South African Small business chambers of commerce & industry  or view www.rcci.co.za to confirm our services and contribution to small businesses, please feel free to contact the head of the Small business chamber linda at Linda Blackbeard  - manager@rcci.co.za 
  Risks & Challenges
The risk to this project in almost nil - as we have already self-funded and launched version one - we simply require the additional funding to launch and code versions 2 and 3 - these being much bigger projects than our initial version and vision 
Versions 2 & 3 can be coded and implemented within three months
All the concept & framework work has been designed - We now need to code, test and upgrade version 1 The importance of this software is that it will allow us to seamlessly provide our Just Ask Small business members with the ability to receive leads and referrals from fellow team members the general public and directly from us at just Ask. It is these business referrals and business opportunities that keep a business in business and in turn provides job opportunities.  
  Other Ways You Can Help If you are a small business owner - you will immediately recognise the importance of protecting and helping fellow small business owners - please leave comments, tips and advice on your successful business rules , do's & don'ts and if you are able to contribute to our ""Shout Out"" we truly appreciate and value your kind support

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><span>The Cobra Club is a community center of sorts - combining a yoga studio that offers calm, meditative classes, and a café that serves beer, wine and a curated menu of locally-sourced comfort foods. The Cobra Club will fill a necessary niche in the rapidly evolving neighborhood of Bushwick, Brooklyn and is aimed at local patrons who find that they have to commute to other neighborhoods and boroughs to enjoy themselves. Founders Nikki Koch, Julia Huffman and Dana Bushman have 20+ years of experience in the arts, hospitality &amp; service industries combined, and through the Cobra Club hope to introduce new people to the benefits of yoga in a </span>non-competitive environment with a focus on self-awareness and injury prevention.</p>
<p><span>Welcoming to all levels, from total beginners to practiced yogis, the Cobra Club will provide an </span><span>environment that supports and embraces each and every person's unique body and personality. The Cobra Club</span><span> also aims to take the stigma out of yoga that the practitioner has to be flexible and able to do complicated and physically demanding poses, while leading a perfectly Zen life of abstinence outside of the yoga studio. Julia, Nikki and Dana recognize that everyone is human, and that vices, in moderation, can help ease difficulties and lead to happier lives. </span></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The floor under the yoga studio is concrete, and we want to install a sprung floor system  to help prevent injuries.

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">Wazi Project differentiates itself from other research companies in that it establishes a dialogue to understand future trends rather than to carry out detached and dispassionate surveys to feed the endless stream of existing statistics.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">Our services include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><strong>Youth opinion surveys</strong> aimed at 13 to 31 year olds, providing corporate and non-corporate clients with a clear understanding of youth concerns and expectations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><strong>A quarterly magazine</strong> containing findings of that quarter's survey results and complemented by opinion pieces from experts and stakeholders that are directly concerned by the issues at hand.

<li>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><strong>PR and media</strong> efforts as an additional and optional service. We help our clients boost their citizenship programmes if they so wish by publicly linking their organisation to the newsworthy outcomes of the commissioned research and pushing these findings to our media contacts</p>
</li>
</ul><p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><strong>Why do we need your contribution?</strong></p>
<p>The key to our success is to create a huge global database of young people who are interested in taking our surveys and giving us their opinion on today's social issues. We believe that once our community is established, reaching out to today's decision-makers and engaging them in a dialogue with tomorrow's decision-makers will become much easier.</p>
<p><strong>Our current strategy:</strong></p>
<p>We are recruiting young people around the world to work as correspondents for us and push out Wazi Project to youth locally. As we have no funds, these positions are currently unpaid making it hard to recruit or to set clear targets for our volunteers.</p>
<p>We are running non-commissioned surveys at the moment to determine what today's most pressing issues are in the eyes of global youth. We expect the results to be eye-opening as many of the topics raised are quite controversial. With our results we intend to generate a media buzz to help establish Wazi Project as an authority on youth research.</p>
<p>All of this would be made much easier if we had the appropriate tools, the funds to reward our correspondents appropriately, the help of professional designers and web developers as well as a highly interactive website and a print magazine.</p>
<p><strong>Your help will be used to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Grow and remunerate our database of young correspondents in order to have a world-wide reach;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop sales and marketing materials to reach out to partners and clients: this will include working with professional designers to create business cards, flyers, pamphlets, etc;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop our website from a rather static page to a highly interactive one where young and old can find a place to engage in dialogue or debate;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Launch a print version of our quarterly magazine and create a distribution network in order to disseminate our findings globally;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is just a start. But we feel that getting Wazi Project going will result in a snowball effect: once we get enough people on board there won't be any way of stopping us and the world will need to listen.</p>
</li>

A quarterly magazine containing findings of that quarter's survey results and complemented by opinion pieces from experts and stakeholders that are directly concerned by the issues at hand. This magazine will initially be online but we hope to develop it into a print magazine with your help.


PR and media efforts as an additional and optional service. We help our clients boost their citizenship programmes if they so wish by publicly linking their organisation to the newsworthy outcomes of the commissioned research and pushing these findings to our media contacts

Why do we need your contribution?
The key to our success is to create a huge global database of young people who are interested in taking our surveys and giving us their opinion on today's social issues. We believe that once our community is established, reaching out to today's decision-makers and engaging them in a dialogue with tomorrow's decision-makers will become much easier.
Our current strategy:
We are recruiting young people around the world to work as correspondents for us and push out Wazi Project to youth locally. As we have no funds, these positions are currently unpaid making it hard to recruit or to set clear targets for our volunteers.
We are running non-commissioned surveys at the moment to determine what today's most pressing issues are in the eyes of global youth. We expect the results to be eye-opening as many of the topics raised are quite controversial. With our results we intend to generate a media buzz to help establish Wazi Project as an authority on youth research.
All of this would be made much easier if we had the appropriate tools, the funds to reward our correspondents appropriately, the help of professional designers and web developers as well as a highly interactive website and a print magazine.
Your help will be used to:


Grow and remunerate our database of young correspondents in order to have a world-wide reach;


Develop sales and marketing materials to reach out to partners and clients: this will include working with professional designers to create business cards, flyers, pamphlets, etc;


Develop our website from a rather static page to a highly interactive one where young and old can find a place to engage in dialogue or debate;


Launch a print version of our quarterly magazine and create a distribution network in order to disseminate our findings globally;


This is just a start. But we feel that getting Wazi Project going will result in a snowball effect: once we get enough people on board there won't be any way of stopping us and the world will need to listen.

How else can you help
We welcome any type of contribution that you want to make. There are many ways to help out.
First of all, you could help create a buzz around Wazi Project. You can like our Facebook page, talk about it with friends and family or use the Indiegogo share tools.
If you fall into our target group (13 to 31), another great way to help us is by taking one of our surveys. Not only are you helping us grow, but you are also making an active contribution in shaping the world into a more informed, transparent and compassionate place.
Apply for a position as correspondent for Wazi Project. Our correspondents are inspiring and well-connected young individuals who support and facilitate our work around the world by representing us in their assigned geographical area. Simply contact us at correspondents@waziproject.com to find out more and see if you fit the bill.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

                   DANCING   HORSE   HEALING  FARM In our hopes to provide this inspirational healing program to women who may benefit from it, we are contacting our local woman's shelter, and Big Sister organizations.  We hope to receive enough funding through this campaign to directly apply funds to scholarships for women who are in need of such an uplifting intervention, but have no resources to pay.  We feel that the horse's healing energies and the supportive programs offered at DANCING HORSE HEALING FARM will enable women to transform and thrive in their lives!                                                                ~We are hoping to hold our first workshops at DANCING HORSE HEALING FARM in October, after the provisions for the farm are finished and programs are fully in place.  Currently, we have 3 women on our waiting list and much positive interest from the community.  Also, just lately, 2 people have offered to volunteer to help with the Vision of the healing farm; this offer of help from these special people just from mention of the healing with horses program, left me filled with gratitude and validation for this very meaningful healing mission.It seems as though many people these days are recognizing and embracing the synergistic energy of horse and human, and experiencing the very unique healing and empowering qualities of the horse.   This is what I call ""Horse Medicine!""                                  An awareness who's time has come!                                Judy and Sassy (aka - Dancing Horse)                                                                 *This campaign is very important to me in many ways: It's important firstly because I want to share this blessing and experience of healing with horses with people that could truly benefit from it.Secondly, I have felt the healing powers of horses many times through out my life.  I am very grateful for the horses and the good people that helped me through some very difficult times in my life.  So, now, I am in a good place in my life, my kids are grown, I have a beautiful farm and I really have a strong desire to give back and share what I have experienced with horse healing energy, in the hopes to help others and really make a difference in their lives.  And hopefully the healing love continues generation to generation and so on. - This is my greatest wish.Lastly, over the years, my children and their music have showed me the ""Dancing Horse"", and this is too beautiful and magical to NOT be shared!Thank you!By supporting and/or contributing to this campaign of Healing with Horses at DANCING HORSE HEALING FARM, you will be helping to uplift, inspire, and heal women thru a nature - based wellness program that will provide for many women and teenage girls the chance to transform their lives and be their healthy authentic selves.  The magnitude of your support is that by helping women to heal and be true to themselves, their healthy higher living will then naturally overflow and enhance all other areas of their lives, including family and other relationships.  This is very important because the healthy woman now has the ability and the tools she needs to teach and be a living example to the next generation, and then those future women to the generation following and the ""healthy cycle"" continues on.............  This healthy cycle will automatically extend out to community through normal daily living and interactions with friends, neighbors, co-workers, etc....

Makers have access to a wide range of tools, equipment, resources, and workspace.  In short:</p><p align=""center""><b>We Make Makers!</b></p><p>We believe the Maker Movement is more than just individuals pursuing a hobby.  Makers are life-long learners, who are passionate about their interest and want to share their projects.  This is where innovation, invention, and jobs start!<br/><br/><i><b>Help us expand to support the growing Maker Community in North San Diego County!</b></i><br/><br/>Thanks to the fantastic support from our community, we have built a great lab in the Vista Business Park. We have been hosting some incredible team projects, from robotic tracked vehicles to liquid-fueled rockets. We're finding more opportunities to support <b>team-based maker challenges</b> for cutting-edge projects and inventions. We can provide the equipment, training, and mentoring for these incredible teams, but often they lack a basic ingredient - funding for their project.</p><p>We're using our Indiegogo InDemand campaign to provide a mechanism for ""microfunding"" these teams. <b>By selecting perks specific for a team, you can directly support the team of your choice</b>.</p><p align=""center""><b>What are team-based maker challenges?</b></p><p>Making covers an incredible range of skill sets and technologies, but too often when we hear about making, it's usually associated with a few basic skills - typically 3D printing and LEDs. Maker challenges put all of these skills and many others into the context of solving problems:</p><blockquote><p>Design and build, or significantly repurpose, a product that will solve a problem, need or want.</p></blockquote><p>Team-based maker challenges are about tackling the toughest problems, and have several common characteristics:</p><ul>
<li>They attempt to solve a problem with a new or novel approach</li>
<li>There is a definite time limit</li>
<li>The problem is large enough that it takes a team to solve it</li>
<li>May take place in a competition format.</li>
</ul><p>In addition to using a combination of many technical skills, team-based maker challenges also require many non-technical skills: ingenuity, teamwork, communications, tenacity, courage and commitment.</p><p align=""center""><b> (here's <i>THE</i> most important paragraph...)</b></p><p>This last set of skills won't be found in any course catalog from your local schools, but employers are constantly seeking people that can <i>demonstrate</i> those skills. The end product is not as important as the path you took to get there. This is where team-based maker challenges come in. They give you the chance to exercise and demonstrate those skills.</p><p align=""center""><b>What kind of challenges do you host at OSML?</b></p><p>Lots!

Makers have access to a wide range of tools, equipment, resources, and workspace.  In short:We Make Makers!We believe the Maker Movement is more than just individuals pursuing a hobby.  Makers are life-long learners, who are passionate about their interest and want to share their projects.  This is where innovation, invention, and jobs start!Help us expand to support the growing Maker Community in North San Diego County!Thanks to the fantastic support from our community, we have built a great lab in the Vista Business Park. We have been hosting some incredible team projects, from robotic tracked vehicles to liquid-fueled rockets. We're finding more opportunities to support team-based maker challenges for cutting-edge projects and inventions. We can provide the equipment, training, and mentoring for these incredible teams, but often they lack a basic ingredient - funding for their project.We're using our Indiegogo InDemand campaign to provide a mechanism for ""microfunding"" these teams. By selecting perks specific for a team, you can directly support the team of your choice.What are team-based maker challenges?Making covers an incredible range of skill sets and technologies, but too often when we hear about making, it's usually associated with a few basic skills - typically 3D printing and LEDs. Maker challenges put all of these skills and many others into the context of solving problems:Design and build, or significantly repurpose, a product that will solve a problem, need or want.Team-based maker challenges are about tackling the toughest problems, and have several common characteristics:
They attempt to solve a problem with a new or novel approach
There is a definite time limit
The problem is large enough that it takes a team to solve it
May take place in a competition format.
In addition to using a combination of many technical skills, team-based maker challenges also require many non-technical skills: ingenuity, teamwork, communications, tenacity, courage and commitment. (here's THE most important paragraph...)This last set of skills won't be found in any course catalog from your local schools, but employers are constantly seeking people that can demonstrate those skills. The end product is not as important as the path you took to get there. This is where team-based maker challenges come in. They give you the chance to exercise and demonstrate those skills.What kind of challenges do you host at OSML?Lots! Here are some examples (past, present and future):
FIRST Robotics
Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition/SEDS-UCSD
Power Racing Series
RoboSub Underwater Autonomous Vehicle Competition
NASA 3D Printing Challenge
and more to come...What can I do at OSML?Are you an entrepreneur with a great idea?  Prototype and build it in our lab!Create, build, learn! We have large, open workspaces filled with cool tools: electronics shop, CNC machines, 3D printers, laser cutters, welding and soldering tools, drawing and modelling programs, and computer lab.     Learning-FriendlyWant to learn a new skill? Take one of our many interactive classes taught by experts. Sign up for classes such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi programming, virtual machines, electronics and circuit design, CNC, and welding.                                                      Why “Open Source”?  Open source accelerates innovation through freedom of collaboration.When people think Open Source, they generally think about software where many people contribute to a product (such as Linux).  But there is also Open Source hardware, where people have access to the design of the components, like Arduino, and other areas like Open Science and Open Education.At Open Source Maker Labs, we value the Open Source philosophy and promote an environment where Open Source hardware, software, science, and education are used.Lifelong Learning at OSMLWe share ideas on new and unique applications of technologies to encourage invention and prototyping. Many of these activities include 3D printing, electronics, robotics, and the use of advanced CNC tools. OSML has a strong focus on using and learning practical skills and applying them creatively – it’s the freedom to innovate, create, and invent – to make whatever you can imagine! We offer classes and workshops that are fun and interactive. If you're a beginner, or want to learn an entirely new skill set, we'll get you started. If you're a pro and are looking for adventure, take on one of our tech challenges and hone your skills. We encourage a collaborative environment where our members can meet and share their knowledge and experience. Members have an opportunity to work together on larger, more complex projects that require different skills and talent.    Supporting our Maker CommunityOSML has been active in the San Diego Maker community, and we’re grateful for enthusiastic response we have received. We played several key roles in bringing together San Diego’s first Maker Faire in October 2015 at Balboa Park, and we're involved in several volunteer groups are working together to bring TWO Maker Faires to San Diego County in 2016.This spring, we've been busy supporting FIRST Robotics Competition Team 4014 and the UCSD SEDS team with mentoring, equipment and technical support. We need to expand now to support the local maker community, students, and entrepreneurs – you can be a part of that!    Actually, It Is Rocket Science.... The UCSD SEDSteam has designed and built a 3D-printed engine powered by liquid oxygen and kerosene for their current rocket, Vulcan-1, and they do frequent tests and builds to improve the design and structure of their rocket. In 2015, they ran a successful crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter, raising $21,882 to pay for an industrial 3D print in inconel (a nickel alloy) of their custom designed engine. They learn CAD on the fly and teach each other how to use power tools and fabrication machines. Through involvement in SEDS, these students learn how to be self-advocates for gaining new skill sets and understanding how the components of the industries work, making them much more competitive as they enter the aerospace job market.The UCSD SEDS team needed more space and fabrication capabilities than what was available on campus, so they went in search of a makerspace - this led them to Open Source Maker Labs. Becoming a build space for SEDS naturally fit in with many of our goals here at the lab, and since we currently host two FIRST Robotics teams and several entrepreneurs developing product prototypes, we ended up with three generations of engineering teams working together. What's in the lab now?

<b>A simple solution for a big problem</b><p></p>
<p>We are a team of 8 bachelor graduated students and we
are attending the MSc in Engineering at the University of Padova. We have been
chosen, after a selection done by a panel of experts at the European Space
Research and Technology Center (<a href=""http://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESTEC"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ESTEC</a>), to participate to the student program
<b>Rexus/Bexus</b>; this project, coordinated by the European Space Agency, allows
students from European universities to carry out scientific and technological
experiments on research rockets and balloons. Our experiment has been selected
to flight in October 2014 on the Bexus stratospheric balloon! However, before
talking too much, let's start from the beginning.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/280539/files/20131227090427-1459967_10151837308622123_257158967_n.jpg?1388163867"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Since the dawn of space exploration, a <b>thermal control system</b> (TCS) for
spacecraft has been required in order to survive to the extreme conditions of
space. TCSs permit to insulate payloads from this extremely cold conditions,
but anyhow, due to their own heat generation, payloads need to be protected also
by overheating. This task was committed to heat radiators.</p>
<p>Nowadays radiators exist in several different forms, designed for every
space mission depending on the function to perform. For this reason it is
difficult to compare different heat radiators, but anyway it is possible to
underline that most of space/planetary missions use passive radiators, simple bare
metal plates, coupled with devices that allow a sort of active control of the
system. These are mostly: heaters, mechanical actuators or devices that involve
the presence of fluids.<br/><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The presence of these devices generates several issues, depending on the
type, such as the strong affection of the electric supply budget, containment
measures for fluids or the use of mechanical actuators with gears and
connections.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>We designed a<i><b> new radiator concept</b></i> which does not involve any of these devices
nor the problems related to them (no typical mechanical actuators with gears ,
no fluids, low power required) nevertheless it allows an active control of the
system varying its <b><i>equivalent thermal resistance</i></b>. </p>

<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In addition, space exploration requires to reduce the mass, sizes and
electrical power demand of spacecrafts and probes; this objective could be
achieved through the miniaturization of spacecraft subsystems, but this
solution is usually constrained by performance requirements, reliability and
other system drivers. Therefore, new ways are to be tested, and one of these is
the development of new technologies, such as new kind of actuators. For this
reason we decided to use actuators based on <b>Electro-Active Polymers. </b></p>
<p>Electro-active polymers (EAPs) are a particular class of polymers, widely
studied in the last decade, which show a <b>deformation</b> in response to an electric
stimulation; this particular behaviour encouraged new studies to test their
potentialities as actuators. Among EAPs, dielectric elastomers (DE) exhibit the
most promising properties. The natural ease of preparing and shaping such DE
materials, coupled with their <b>low mass</b> and large displacements, show that they
have the potential to enable new technologies, like actuators often referred to
as <b>artificial muscles</b>.<br/>In summary, the advantages of DE actuators are several:
they are characterized
by a low density (mass reduction, inertia forces reduction), they have a
limited number of moving parts (reduced complexity, reduced costs, higher
reliability) and they provide a direct conversion of electrical energy into
mechanical energy.</p>
<p>We decided to explore a new path for active thermal control. We had the
innovative idea to switch the way in which the heat passes through the radiator,
by varying it from conduction to radiation. <br/>
In detail, our radiator we present is composed by<b> three overlapped parallel
plates</b> constrained so that is possible to separate them or put them in good
thermal contact. This switching operation, the actuation between the open/close
condition of the plates, allows to vary the system equivalent thermal
resistance and so to control the heat dissipated to the environment.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/280546/files/20131227090638-PIANTA_1mod.jpg?1388163998"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The simplicity of this concept, along with its high
adaptability to <b>variable environmental conditions</b>, makes it suitable for a lot
of future aerospace applications, especially for planetary probes without
attitude control (i.e. balloons, airships and rovers on Mars, Venus and Titan).</span>
</p>
<h1>Trust us, it works</h1>
<p></p>
<p>We made several FEM simulation using<b> Matlab®</b> in order to understand how the system works and what his performances are.</p>
<p>The results are extraordinary: we are able to control the temperature of the dummy payload in an effective and rapid manner.</p>
<p>We also
 simulated a stratopheric balloon flight up to 30 km, with all random 
thermal loads considered (Sun, planetary albedo, convection, etc).</p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">As you can see from the graph, we are able to guarantee the thermal stead<font>i</font>ness of the payload (between 7000s and 10000s). </span></p>
<p>In
 the peak at 6000s is shown how effective is this kind of radiator to 
warm the payload in case of need and, after that, how quickly it can 
dissipate heat if required.</p>

Electro-active polymers (EAPs) are a particular class of polymers, widely
studied in the last decade, which show a deformation in response to an electric
stimulation; this particular behaviour encouraged new studies to test their
potentialities as actuators. Among EAPs, dielectric elastomers (DE) exhibit the
most promising properties. The natural ease of preparing and shaping such DE
materials, coupled with their low mass and large displacements, show that they
have the potential to enable new technologies, like actuators often referred to
as artificial muscles.In summary, the advantages of DE actuators are several:
they are characterized
by a low density (mass reduction, inertia forces reduction), they have a
limited number of moving parts (reduced complexity, reduced costs, higher
reliability) and they provide a direct conversion of electrical energy into
mechanical energy.
We decided to explore a new path for active thermal control. We had the
innovative idea to switch the way in which the heat passes through the radiator,
by varying it from conduction to radiation. 
In detail, our radiator we present is composed by three overlapped parallel
plates constrained so that is possible to separate them or put them in good
thermal contact. This switching operation, the actuation between the open/close
condition of the plates, allows to vary the system equivalent thermal
resistance and so to control the heat dissipated to the environment.







The simplicity of this concept, along with its high
adaptability to variable environmental conditions, makes it suitable for a lot
of future aerospace applications, especially for planetary probes without
attitude control (i.e. balloons, airships and rovers on Mars, Venus and Titan).

Trust us, it works

We made several FEM simulation using Matlab® in order to understand how the system works and what his performances are.
The results are extraordinary: we are able to control the temperature of the dummy payload in an effective and rapid manner.
We also
 simulated a stratopheric balloon flight up to 30 km, with all random 
thermal loads considered (Sun, planetary albedo, convection, etc).





As you can see from the graph, we are able to guarantee the thermal steadiness of the payload (between 7000s and 10000s). 
In
 the peak at 6000s is shown how effective is this kind of radiator to 
warm the payload in case of need and, after that, how quickly it can 
dissipate heat if required.

HELP US! SUPPORT US! WE REALLY NEED IT TO ACHIEVE OUR DREAM!



These sponsors will provide us the stratospheric balloon, however we have to build and develop the new technology we want to test.


The CISAS and DII departments of University of Padova will help us for about 30% of  direct costs, the remaining is at our charge.
We
 estimate that the total cost will be about 30000 €, due to the 
components that have to withstand heavy thermal and structural loads.Any support that you give will enable us to make a major step towards our goal.

The path to success? Together with us!
Tie
 your name or your brand to POLARIS experiment. We will do several 
conferences, pubblications and trips in which you can obtain visibility to 
the main european space agencies and aerospace industries.
Your brand/name will be also written in our documentation and attached to the experiment during the flight.

professional dancer and competitive junior Olympic gymnast who suffered a
severe lower back injury, which ended my career in all forms of movement in
July of 2002 (as I was told by a dozen spinal orthopedics) During this time of
depression, and physical and mental trauma, my younger cousin was diagnosed
with <b>Autism</b> - something I did not understand. This child, however, would become
the light at the end of the tunnel. He helped me regain all of my strength,
courage and ambition for the passions I had in life.  As I began my
training as an ABA therapist and began to do hands on work with my cousin, I
found myself falling in love with the work of helping a child with special
needs. During this time, my work with autistic children became a big part
of my life,as I took on more cases working
independently with autistic children.</p><p style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></p><p style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/431826/files/20140313153225-62789_107144862683023_6301080_n.jpg?1394749945"" src="""" style=""width: 288.71244635193136px; height: 217px;""/> </p><p style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">(Dr Temple Grandin and I) ""I had the pleasure of meeting her three times and attending her conferences""</span></p><p style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></p><p style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Although content in my ABA work, something was
missing; it was my passion, my drive and my vision for movement in dance and
fitness.It was during this time that I
found IM=X Pilates. It was the right form of rehabilitation I needed to regain
some form of normalcy in my body. It helped
so much in my physical and mental rehabilitation that I decided to become
certified in the discipline. This was not enough for me, so I sought out other options and came across </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The Laban
Institute for movement studies. </span><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><i>“Where my life changed”</i></b><br/></p><p style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b></b></p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">

 I regained enough strength to begin moving
again, I realized that it had all started with these special children that were
meant to cross my path. They helped me regain the courage and strength I needed
to get back into movement. The more time I invested in a child with </span><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Autism</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">, the
more I began to believe in myself. I started to expand my physical
capabilities. It was then I found Zumba, this fun exciting dance craze brought
me back to my Latin dance roots. It was a great way for me to get back into
dancing. I decided to become certified because I thought it was a great way to
connect others to dance.</span><p></p><p style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">In June of 2011 I decided to go for it all; it was
time to pull out everything I had stored in a box (diagrams, business plans,
the name ‘Breakin Boundaries’) since I was 14, and make it a reality.  I
rented space from a friend in Greenpoint, Brooklyn who owns OTOM GYM. 
There I taught IM=X Pilates and ZUMBA in a basement. I began teaching my
members about the proper movements and alignments of their bodies, making
modifications for their specific needs and their own disabilities. People began
to thank me for what I have done for them, and my response in return was
always, and still is, “no, thank you!”</p><p style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/433177/files/20140314061711-66234_110133942384115_6874699_n.jpg?1394803031"" src="""" style=""width: 297.79411764705884px; height: 225px;""/></p><p>(Where it all began and yes I was 5 months pregnant)</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I found a beautiful space that I finally took the
plunge for and officially opened up </span><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Breakin Boundaries</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">.
My dream had come true.  I offered various adult and children
classes and quickly became successful in doing so.This
short-lived dream became a reality, from a

My story:  I was a former
professional dancer and competitive junior Olympic gymnast who suffered a
severe lower back injury, which ended my career in all forms of movement in
July of 2002 (as I was told by a dozen spinal orthopedics) During this time of
depression, and physical and mental trauma, my younger cousin was diagnosed
with Autism - something I did not understand. This child, however, would become
the light at the end of the tunnel. He helped me regain all of my strength,
courage and ambition for the passions I had in life.  As I began my
training as an ABA therapist and began to do hands on work with my cousin, I
found myself falling in love with the work of helping a child with special
needs. During this time, my work with autistic children became a big part
of my life,as I took on more cases working
independently with autistic children. (Dr Temple Grandin and I) ""I had the pleasure of meeting her three times and attending her conferences""Although content in my ABA work, something was
missing; it was my passion, my drive and my vision for movement in dance and
fitness.It was during this time that I
found IM=X Pilates. It was the right form of rehabilitation I needed to regain
some form of normalcy in my body. It helped
so much in my physical and mental rehabilitation that I decided to become
certified in the discipline. This was not enough for me, so I sought out other options and came across The Laban
Institute for movement studies. “Where my life changed”

 I regained enough strength to begin moving
again, I realized that it had all started with these special children that were
meant to cross my path. They helped me regain the courage and strength I needed
to get back into movement. The more time I invested in a child with Autism, the
more I began to believe in myself. I started to expand my physical
capabilities. It was then I found Zumba, this fun exciting dance craze brought
me back to my Latin dance roots. It was a great way for me to get back into
dancing. I decided to become certified because I thought it was a great way to
connect others to dance.
In June of 2011 I decided to go for it all; it was
time to pull out everything I had stored in a box (diagrams, business plans,
the name ‘Breakin Boundaries’) since I was 14, and make it a reality.  I
rented space from a friend in Greenpoint, Brooklyn who owns OTOM GYM. 
There I taught IM=X Pilates and ZUMBA in a basement. I began teaching my
members about the proper movements and alignments of their bodies, making
modifications for their specific needs and their own disabilities. People began
to thank me for what I have done for them, and my response in return was
always, and still is, “no, thank you!”(Where it all began and yes I was 5 months pregnant)I found a beautiful space that I finally took the
plunge for and officially opened up Breakin Boundaries.
My dream had come true.  I offered various adult and children
classes and quickly became successful in doing so.This
short-lived dream became a reality, from a
financial perspective, when I finally realized my rent was just way too high
for me to stay. In June 2013, I stopped all children’s classes and with a
second baby boy on the way, I had no choice but to sell my lease.    (Before)                                        (After)
I seamlessly moved my entire adult program to a Greenpoint location in January 2014, with the hopes of lowering my rent. That being said, my members continued to come to every class whether it’s to let loose, feel good, be healthier or to consult with me about a plan to better themselves.(607 Manhattan Avenue location)Although the space Breakin Boundaries is currently occupying
is beautiful, it is not enough for us to reach our full potential.  Any
money donated would be greatly appreciated and put towards our expansion. Your
contributions would be a huge help.                                           Other Ways You Can Help                               *Share this campaign with friends and family*         *Spread the word by posting to social media (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram)*

<h2>Let's Talk</h2>

Human'ESDES is a registered non-profit in Lyon, France. We work with Jokkolabs in Mali, a social-change hub and co-working space on the MALeBOOKS project.Mali (West Africa) desperately needs books.
That's a fact, and that's a problem. Shipping books is not possible: too heavy, too hard to select, too difficult to distribute and maintain.What if we could send them eReaders (Kindle-like) instead and fill those with thousands of books ? Would that help ?→ Help us raise about $5,000 and find out after 6 months!
A Simple GoalWe believe in reading being an extremely useful development factor ; by itself.
We don't want to force people to read.
We don't want to have them read only educational content.
We want them to discover and (really) enjoy reading.
We want to them to open their minds themselves and gain have a free-hobby.

We want to provide content-full devices to various groups of people who might benefit from reading and see what happens.

Do they use it ?
If no, why ? Can the limitation be overcame ?
If yes, what are they reading ? 

What reading materials are the most attracting ?

We only need hardware money. Everything else is covered!
We understand how frustrating it can feel to donate to such a project and see all the money going into misc expenditures.
This is why we already raised €6,000 which will cover all the non-hardware cost: plane tickets, shipping, customs, training, distribution, etc. Indiegogers are only left with the actual hardware, how relieving!

<p><strong>What is Play City?</strong></p>
<p>Play City is a socially responsible Indoor Playground concept for kids of all ages. A place where kids can have fun, be active, creative, and social – all in a safe, clean and friendly environment. Play City aims to help the fight against childhood obesity and other pediatric diseases with this unique facility where kids of all ages can find fun activities they will love and want to repeat over and over again.</p>
<p><strong>All profits from this facility will go to pediatric health and wellness charities.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>ALL profits??  Yes, ALL profits!</strong></h2>
<h2> </h2>
<p><strong>The Background</strong></p>
<p>When the current 35-45 year old parents were growing up, computers were barely becoming available (I got my first Atari when I was 16!).  The internet, iPads, iPods,  and even cell phones seemed like a science fiction movie as likely as humans living on Mars. So what were the forms of entertainment for kids back then? It was going outside, playing with friends, playing sports, and being active!</p>
<p>We’re not blaming childhood obesity on the internet and video games alone, but statistics show that the childhood obesity rate in the US has TRIPLED since 1963! Among children today, obesity is causing a broad range of health problems that previously weren’t seen until adulthood. These include high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and elevated blood cholesterol levels. There are also psychological effects: Obese children are more prone to low self-esteem, negative body image and depression. And excess weight at young ages has been linked to higher and earlier death rates in adulthood.</p>
<p>Physical inactivity is a major risk factor for developing heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. The American Heart Association recommends that children and adolescents participate in at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity every day.</p>
<p>Another reason why kids stay at home more is that most of us don’t feel safe letting our kids year old kids go out of the house on their own anymore. All you hear about in the news are kidnappings, shootings, sexual predators (check on the internet how many registered sex offenders live within 10 miles of you!), and just overall an unsafe place and time to grow up. For those who live in a “safe” neighborhood, you still don’t let the kids go further than 50 feet away from the house. Admit it – you’re scared something will happen to them!</p>
<h2><strong>What will Play City offer?</strong></h2>
<h3>Play City will offer all types of fun, creative, and thought-provoking activities and games for kids of all ages (even the big kids among us!):<br/><br/><strong>-Feature Attraction – a Laser Maze Course</strong>
</h3>
<p>It’s just like in the movies! Imagine you enter a mysterious room and as you cross the starting point, the Laser Maze pops to life and the room ahead of you is filled with brilliant green lasers radiating from the walls. Music and light effects immerse you into the experience. It’s time to put your game face on. The Laser Maze Challenge is a timed event. The lower the time, the better. The mission is to navigate the Maze without breaking a beam. If you do, that’s OK, you’re simply penalized with time being added to your score. As you expertly navigate through the web of lasers, going over and under lasers as quickly as possible on your way to the end of the Maze, be sure to select the Mission Objectives along the way. When you reach the end and navigate beyond the final laser beam, you select the Mission Complete which finishes your challenge and determines your time/score.</p>

The latest project began in December 2010 when the Mayor of Williamsport met with a non-profit organization with more than 30 years of experience in the ice rink business. At that point it was a vague plan, something to build upon.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2012 the idea was presented to the public and set in motion. What was needed: lots of money and the acquisiion of the Picklener Arena that was being used for roller hockey and soccer. The Picklener Arena could be retrofitted with ice and ready for business by October 2012. Neither of the initatives gained enough support by the June 30th deadline.</p>
<p>The idea of putting a refrigerated ice surface at Historic Bowman Field, home to a professional baseball team, came to light and the necessary research and discussion ocurred.  An announcement was made to the public in July 2012 at Bowman Field that an open ice arena would indeed be constructed.</p>
<p>Construction of the rink began in ealry October and was ready for the home opener. The home opener game for the professional hockey team broke all attendance records for the league. Other programs offered included: public skating sessions, skating lessons for children and adults, youth and adult ice hockey and skating lessons for Special Needs Children! Public skating times were very popular with the school students of all ages and surrounding colleges and universities. The youth hockey program attracted fewer participants than hoped for, but the adults hockey program flourished. The skating lessons for children and adults were nicely attended, but the Special Needs program thrived.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as the temperatures dropped, so did the attendance at the hockey games. Bad weather, including rain and snow closed the rink more than once, resulting in lost revenue. The rink closed one day ahead of schedule because of lost revenue and the hockey team could not play their last home game.</p>
<p>It was a risky experiment, leaving the City of Williamsport with unpaid utility bills by the hockey team and the non-profit organization. It is our goal to raise money to help pay these bills, with the hope that our efforts will heal the wound caused by the outoor rink project.</p>
<p>That is where we come in. A group of people, who did not know each other before this time, have come together to continue the crusade for an indoor ice rink for Williamsport.</p></div>","The idea of an indoor ice arena for Williamsport has been sought after for more than 30 years with many starts and stops.

<h2>The Big Picture</h2>
<p><span>Bust'DD (pronounced busted) is the first<span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span><em><strong>reasonable</strong></em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span>alternative for large-busted women to get supportive, affordable, comfortable, and stylish bras.  Unlike our competitors, we provide an accurate way to determine your bra size without long questionnaires about your breasts, fancy computer algorithms or molded plastic cups.  We’ll be offering size combinations most stores don’t carry along with convenient sales models. </span></p>
<p><span>The founders are Kim Johnson and Laura Johnson.  We are both busty women so we know the issues being faced by busty ladies.  We are both<span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span><strong>fed up</strong><span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span>with the intimate apparel industry!!  We want to make bras better, prettier and sell them at a lower price by making and selling them ourselves (we're cutting out the middle<em>men</em>).</span></p>
<p><span>At least 4 out of 5 women are wearing the wrong size bra.  And with all the different ways to measure combined with massive amounts of mis-information, we're not surprised.  There are<span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span><em>so many</em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span>women above a D cup, many of whom don't even know it.  And those who know they are a G, H or I cup are beyond frustrated with selection, availability and price.  We deserve better.  So Bust'DD is here to start the BRAvolution for millions of women.</span></p>
<p><span>We’re moving from the startup/prototype phase into the beta phase, so we’re glad you’re here!  Join the BRAvolution and help us bring quality bras to market.  Please donate to our campaign today!  </span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></h2>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>Designing, constructing and manufacturing bras is difficult business.  We're up to the challenge, but we need your help!  We are making at least 3-4 styles for our beta run.  Then we're manufacturing about 10 of each style in different sizes.  Finally, we'll field test these bras by giving these to real women and allowing them (and potentially YOU) to provide us feedback to make them the best bras possible.  Upon completion of all these steps, we will make changes as needed and roll out our first line of bras, all thanks to you!</span></p>

<p><span>If you are a busty woman, we don't need to explain the impact Bust'DD will make.  Bras currently on the market are uncomfortable, expensive and ugly in the larger cup sizes.  Not to mention hard to find and impossible to understand what size you are.  Bust'DD is fixing all of that!</span></p>
<p><span>When busty women are forced to buy their ugly, expensive bras online, society has told them they are ""odd"" or not worth making quality bras for such a small segment of the market.  First, this is not a small segment of the market.  Due to the mis-information around sizing, there are actually millions of women who are DD+, but simply have no idea.  </span></p>
<p><span>Don't take it from us, take it from the women affected:</span></p>
<p><em>""I wear a size 32DDDD, which is impossible to find in any store""</em></p>
<p><em>""I have huge boobs and normal dept stores that have lower prices don't carry my size.""</em></p>
<p><em>""When I'm lucky enough to find my size, the selection is really, really poor.  I'm lucky to find anything that's not very basic and white.""</em></p>
<p><em>""Cute bras never come bigger than a C cup.""</em></p>
<p><em>""It seems that most stores only sell cup sizes up to DD. It would be nice if larger cup sizes were more widely available. Also, I can't seem to find any cute or sexy bras in my size.

<p><em>""Please don't assume the women buying a DD-cup bra are over the age of 60. Make the larger sizes in cute styles and colors.

Bust'DD (pronounced busted) is the first reasonable alternative for large-busted women to get supportive, affordable, comfortable, and stylish bras.  Unlike our competitors, we provide an accurate way to determine your bra size without long questionnaires about your breasts, fancy computer algorithms or molded plastic cups.  We’ll be offering size combinations most stores don’t carry along with convenient sales models. 
The founders are Kim Johnson and Laura Johnson.  We are both busty women so we know the issues being faced by busty ladies.  We are both fed up with the intimate apparel industry!!  We want to make bras better, prettier and sell them at a lower price by making and selling them ourselves (we're cutting out the middlemen).
At least 4 out of 5 women are wearing the wrong size bra.  And with all the different ways to measure combined with massive amounts of mis-information, we're not surprised.  There are so many women above a D cup, many of whom don't even know it.  And those who know they are a G, H or I cup are beyond frustrated with selection, availability and price.  We deserve better.  So Bust'DD is here to start the BRAvolution for millions of women.
We’re moving from the startup/prototype phase into the beta phase, so we’re glad you’re here!  Join the BRAvolution and help us bring quality bras to market.  Please donate to our campaign today!  
What We Need & What You Get


Designing, constructing and manufacturing bras is difficult business.  We're up to the challenge, but we need your help!  We are making at least 3-4 styles for our beta run.  Then we're manufacturing about 10 of each style in different sizes.  Finally, we'll field test these bras by giving these to real women and allowing them (and potentially YOU) to provide us feedback to make them the best bras possible.  Upon completion of all these steps, we will make changes as needed and roll out our first line of bras, all thanks to you!
We're asking for $25,000 to get the process started and we'll put every penny received to good use in making the beta version of our bras.  But you can help take us even further!  We've set a stretch goal of $65,000. Take a look at the chart below to see where the money goes at each target level.

<p><strong>Hi, I am Nadine! </strong></p>
<p>It has been my LIFE LONG DREAM to go to South Africa and help with animals and the environment that they and human beings share. I finally have my chance to go through a non profit organization and contribute my part in helping this world.</p>
<p>I have been selected to represent the United States by volunteering in South Africa this summer with International Student Volunteers (ISV), a volunteer and travel organization. I am seeking your sponsorship, so that I can make a difference abroad this summer.</p>
<p>ISV is an internationally recognized and awarded organization that appoints university students from the U.S., Canada, Australia and the U.K. to various countries around the world in an effort to impact entire communities and endangered habitats in need. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>South Africa?</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>I have spent years donating my time in my local community and all over Los Angeles. Whether it be through food pantries or helping at places like ""The Gentle Barn"" my heart has always been towards helping and lending a hand in any possible way I can. </p>
<p>Now that I am in college I have this HUGE opportunity to broaden my volunteering efforts in ways that I never thought could be possible.  </p>
<p>While on my environmental conservation project, I’ll receive hands-on, practical experience supporting such issues as endangered species preservation or habitat restoration, which will strengthen my understanding of the world at large and lead me on a path of ecological conservation to impact our world for years to come.</p>
<p><span>Many species of animals are running out of space and their territories are overlapping with that of people – conflict results; animals are sometimes poisoned, shot or trapped. Wildlife care and rehabilitation centers not only have a role in caring for injured wildlife but also in education programs to help people learn to live with their animal neighbors more harmoniously. During this program I plan on guiding and rehabilitating these helpless animals and educating people on such issues.</span></p>
<p><span>During my trip I will have time to connect with children from local orphanges and educate them on certain topics such as AIDs awareness while creating a special bond with them. <span>ISV is working to assist local organizations with their efforts to fill the gaps left by government systems in selected communities to make these children feel like they have a chance to live a fufilling life. </span></span></p>
<p><span>Every little step can lead towards something so beautiful and powerful to create change for the greater good! And that is what I plan to do while I am volunteering my time in South Africa.</span></p>

<p>Community Technology Alliance (CTA) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing critical technology and services to aid in <strong>preventing and ending homelessness</strong> nationwide – beginning with the world’s hub of technology: Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>CTA provides technology to nonprofits and other organizations to help them collect data about their services and conduct comprehensive research about homeless men and women. With this information, we can make informed decisions about a population of people who are widely misunderstood and also in great need of our assistance. <strong>In 2011 alone, over 90,000 individuals in need received lifesaving services from CTA’s partner organizations. </strong></p>
<p>We know ending homelessness sounds like a crazy goal. Well our answer is simple: We are committed to this goal because people are dying in our streets.</p>
<p>This is a social issue that affects us all. It's a human right to have a warm place to sleep, food to nourish our bodies and to feel cared about. Plus, all of us who are working to accomplish this goal feel terrific knowing we are changing lives dramatically, and giving hope to those who have lost hope.</p>
<p><strong>We drive the technology. You drive us. Together we will end homelessness.</strong></p>
<p>So how will your support help? Much of what drives us is support from our community and donors, like you. Without the support of our community, we make less of an impact and our reach is limited. But with your help, we can provide assistance to more organizations and collect reliable and comprehensive data using the latest technologies and ultimately we get closer to reaching our goal: ending homelessness. We’d like you to be a part of reaching this goal. </p>
<p><strong>Our technology is changing lives. Be a part of that change.</strong></p>
<p>CTA has created several technologies that are directly helping homeless men and women everyday. Here are a few examples of the technology and research tools CTA provides:</p>
<p>• <strong>Community VoiceMail</strong> provides a contact number for homeless individuals to receive messages from potential employers, landlords, social workers and family.</p>
<p>• <strong>Homeless Management Information System (HMIS): </strong>CTA hosts the HMIS system for four Bay Area counties. HMIS is the required data collection tool for organizations receiving federal monies from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. It helps keep track of demographics, services and program outcomes.</p>
<p>• <strong>CTA proactively links</strong> human service programs across five Bay Area counties to leverage data and systems to reduce redundancies and costs.</p>
<p>• <strong>A CTA-created web and smartphone application</strong> has been used to survey more than 1300 individuals about their level of vulnerability to premature death due to the harsh conditions of life on the street.</p>
<p>• <strong>Housing One</strong>, a crowd-funding site hosted by CTA, allows individual donors to easily contribute to cover move-in costs for homeless individuals transitioning into their own apartments.</p>
<p>• <strong>The Shelter Bed Hotline</strong>, a life-saving automated referral service provided by CTA, connected 7200 callers to homeless shelters in 2011.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Support us in more than one way</strong></p>
<p>The power of reaching out to our friends, family, coworkers and neighbors can never be overrated. You don’t have to ask them to donate – simply spreading the word about our work does the trick. The more people tweet, like, share, email and chat about us, the more likely we are to reach our goal.</p>
<p>We encourage you to spread the word far and wide about CTA’s work and how we are driving technology to take on mountainous goals like ending homelessness. With your support we <em>will</em> end homelessness, but as with all great accomplishments it’s a team effort.</p>

We are a team of experienced biohackers from the Bay Area biohacker spaces <a href=""http://counterculturelabs.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Counter Culture Labs</a> in Oakland, CA and <a href=""http://biocurious.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BioCurious</a> in Sunnyvale, CA. Together, we are engineering regular baker's yeast to produce the world's first real vegan cheese protein and from there, the worlds first Real Vegan Cheese!

<h2></h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/687263/files/20140701081646-vegan_cheese_team_photo_enhanced.jpg?1404227806"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h2>What is Real Vegan Cheese?</h2>
<p>Real Vegan Cheese is a not a cheese substitute! It all begins with regular old baker's yeast. Through synthetic biology, we engineer our yeast to become milk-protein factories, churning out real milk proteins (known as caseins). These milk proteins are then combined with water, vegan sugar and oil to make a kind of milk which is ultimately converted into Real Vegan Cheese using the age-old cheese-making process.<br/></p>

<p>To create our proteins, we study animal genomes to find natural milk-protein genetic sequences. We optimize the genes for use in yeast and synthesize the resulting yeast milk protein DNA from scratch. This DNA is then put into yeast cells where the cellular machinery takes over and produces real milk-protein from the DNA blueprint provided by us. No animal products involved. Plus the purified proteins will be identical to those found in regular cheese, and will not contain any GMO!</p>

<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>The work we do can be expensive, but the rewards will be great! If 
funding for this project is successful, we will be able to create 
variants of baker's yeast that produce the four milk-proteins needed for
 cheese, then purify the proteins and make the worlds first Real Vegan 
Cheese! All of our research will be made available on our wiki as it 
happens and will be licensed under free and open licenses. All 
patentable technology will be released into the public domain. The team 
consists of 100% unpaid volunteers so all of the funding from this 
campaign will go toward the cost of materials, equipment and physical 
space.</p>

Both a little over 1"" in size (3cm), and available at the $50 level.</p>
<p><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/766540/files/20140804174201-IMG_0060b.jpg?1407199321"" src="""" style=""width: 206.20118343195267px;height: 144px;""/>We've also tried some 3D prints in solid metal of the chymosin enzyme. We really love the gold plated version on the left, but at the slightly larger size (~3/4 inch) that you see for the nickel plated one on the right. Metal prints are a bit more expensive, so we're offering this one at $70. Looks and feels a bit like a gold nugget.</p>

<h2>Our Team</h2>
<p>The Real Vegan Cheese project is open to collaborators of all skill levels and from all walks of life. In October we will be entering our Real Vegan Cheese project into the International Genetically Engineered Machine (<a href=""http://igem.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">iGEM</a>) synthetic biology competition. We are excited to be part of a larger global community consisting of students and biohackers from over 30 countries!</p>
<h2>Impacts</h2>
<p>We live in an unsustainable world. The cheese we eat today is produced by commercial dairy cows which, though they produce delicious milk and cheese, have an exceptionally large carbon footprint.  Even the U,N. Food and Agriculture Organization reports that the world's 1.5 billion cows emit dozens of polluting gases, including large amounts of methane. This methane gas is a leading contributor to global warming!</p>
<p>By creating an alternative pathway to cheese, we help the environment, increase access to tasty and healthy food, and support people who have already committed themselves to a smaller personal carbon footprint.<br/></p><p>Our team of scientists have an amazing reputation for being passionate contributors to technological and scientific innovation as well as social and environmental justice. We are excited to take this passion into the world and prove that we together through open science can make huge strides in technology while being socially and environmentally responsible. Together we can change the way the world values, creates and consumes cheese.</p>
<h2>Health effects</h2>
<p>Not only can we make Real Vegan Cheese that is better for the environment, we can also design it to be better for <i>you</i><i>:</i></p><ul>
<li><p>For each of the four main proteins found in cheese, there are dozens of known genetic variants found in humans and in different breeds of cows. Some of these versions of the proteins are associated with various health benefits, or increased risks of allergic response. We have the opportunity to pick and choose the most desirable variants of these naturally occurring proteins, increasing health benefits and removing allergens.<br/></p></li>
<li>
<p>There are clear health benefits to consuming milk proteins derived from humans versus cow milk proteins. This is made possible by expressing the genes that code for human milk proteins in yeast. Using human genes to make vegan milk may not be appetizing to everyone, so for you folks that love good old-fashioned cow cheeses, we’re also making a vegan cow cheese.</p>
</li>
</ul><h2></h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/687316/files/20140701083426-marc_in_lab.jpg?1404228866"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>The path to Real Vegan Cheese is not an easy one. The science and cheese-making processes pose certain challenges that must be addressed.</p>
<p>As a health conscious and ecologically responsible collective, we have our own concerns about our process. We do not want to produce food in a way that replicates the shortcomings of some existing Genetic Engineering companies. One of our major challenges will be to evaluate whether the technology we work with is safe. We will need to continually re-evaluate risks and design safe-guards that prevent or limit potential dangers to individuals, humanity or the planet as a whole.</p>
<p>Our Molecular Biology team is focused on creating low-cost solutions to producing cheese protein. Utilizing yeast as protein factories can be challenging. The proteins we want them to produce are complex and designed by nature for animal systems. Yeast have the same internal machinery as cows or goats (or humans) but the cellular machinery is primitive in comparison. To create functional milk-proteins we will have to help yeast perform protein modifications similar to those that occur naturally in animals. In our process we plan to incorporate helpful enzymes that make yeast-derived milk proteins perform like animal milk-proteins. The addition of these animal-inspired enzymes will help our Cheese-Making team produce Real Vegan Cheese!</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>Is it really vegan?</h3>
<p>Yes. Our genes are made from scratch to work in yeast, and though they are inspired by mammals, none of the genes, organisms or growth mediums we use have ever been part of an animal. </p>
<h3>Will the cheese contain GMOs?</h3>
<p>In short: No. While we genetically modify yeast, the yeast itself is not eaten, and the resulting milk-protein is separated from the GMOs before being turned into cheese. This method has been used for many years to produce safe medicines and foods such as insulin and vanilla flavoring. In fact, the rennet used in most cheese today is produced using this same method. This has meant that the old and ethically questionable method of extracting rennet from the stomachs of calves has fallen out of favor.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/687305/files/20140701083125-purifying_protein_scaled.jpg?1404228685"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Will you be eating this cheese?</h3>
<p>Eventually, yes - that is the goal. But it may be a while before we reach that point. We will need to do some more research on exactly how to follow all FDA regulations regarding foods generated using genetically engineered organisms. If we can achieve a sufficiently purified product, show that it does not contain any foreign DNA or living organisms, and produce everything in suitable facilities, then we believe that we will be able to safely and legally produce cheese for consumption. Until we meet all those requirements, all cheese protein we produce will be clearly labeled as “Not for Human Consumption”.</p>
<h3>When can we buy your cheese?</h3>
<p>Hold your horses! We are still in the Research &amp; Development stage right now - that is what our Indiegogo campaign (and our participation in the iGEM competition) is all about. Once we have proven that we can actually do this, we’ll still need to figure out how to scale up from milligrams to kilograms, and how to produce our cheese in the most food-safe and economical way. <br/></p>
<h3>But aren’t you sending out a Real Vegan Cheese as one of your IndieGogo perks?</h3>
<p>We hope to brew a big batch of yeast at the end of the project, and have enough cheese protein for one small cheese. Any donor at the “Big Cheese” level will have the option of receiving a cheese made from that batch (likely labeled as “Not for Human Consumption”), assuming we can make enough protein. Or they can choose to receive a cheese-shaped prop made using their own personalized cheese press, and a rain check for our first fully FDA compliant cheese.</p>
<h3>What if I'm lactose intolerant, or allergic to milk proteins?</h3><p>Since we will be producing pure cheese protein, there will be NO lactose in Real Vegan Cheese whatsoever. We will likely be adding some other type of sugar (not lactose), both for flavor, and to feed the bacterial cultures that are used in cheese ripening. Cows milk protein allergy is an entirely different issue from lactose intolerance. Since we have the luxury of engineering everything from scratch, we can choose the least allergenic naturally occurring casein variants from cows or other dairy animals. Even better - we can swap out one or more of the cow proteins for the human version, which should be the least allergenic of all!</p>
<h3>Can you mail to my country?</h3>
<p>Due to local regulations regarding shipping of DNA, we may not be able to send the Biohacker Special kit to all countries. Please check your local laws!</p><p></p><p></p>

But it will be a long road from there to putting Real Vegan Cheese on the shelves. Visit our website to support this project

All stretch goals achieved!Featured in:


















We are a team of experienced biohackers from the Bay Area biohacker spaces Counter Culture Labs in Oakland, CA and BioCurious in Sunnyvale, CA. Together, we are engineering regular baker's yeast to produce the world's first real vegan cheese protein and from there, the worlds first Real Vegan Cheese!

What is Real Vegan Cheese?
Real Vegan Cheese is a not a cheese substitute! It all begins with regular old baker's yeast. Through synthetic biology, we engineer our yeast to become milk-protein factories, churning out real milk proteins (known as caseins). These milk proteins are then combined with water, vegan sugar and oil to make a kind of milk which is ultimately converted into Real Vegan Cheese using the age-old cheese-making process.
How can yeast produce milk protein?
To create our proteins, we study animal genomes to find natural milk-protein genetic sequences. We optimize the genes for use in yeast and synthesize the resulting yeast milk protein DNA from scratch. This DNA is then put into yeast cells where the cellular machinery takes over and produces real milk-protein from the DNA blueprint provided by us. No animal products involved. Plus the purified proteins will be identical to those found in regular cheese, and will not contain any GMO!
Want to hear more hard-core science?
Drink straight from the fire hose over at our Wiki! Learn all about casein micelles, the different casein proteins and their genetic variants, why casein kinase is not the kinase that acts on casein, our plans for vegan lactose substitutes, and more. And feel free to ask us questions in the Comments section...

Why Real Vegan Cheese?

We believe that using animals as large-scale food production machines is ethically and environmentally irresponsible.
We believe that our process is more ethically responsible and environmentally sustainable than the status quo.
We believe that all humans, vegans included, should have access to delicious and healthy cheese!


What We Need & What You Get
The work we do can be expensive, but the rewards will be great! If 
funding for this project is successful, we will be able to create 
variants of baker's yeast that produce the four milk-proteins needed for
 cheese, then purify the proteins and make the worlds first Real Vegan 
Cheese! All of our research will be made available on our wiki as it 
happens and will be licensed under free and open licenses. All 
patentable technology will be released into the public domain. The team 
consists of 100% unpaid volunteers so all of the funding from this 
campaign will go toward the cost of materials, equipment and physical 
space.
3D printed Jewelry Perks
Here are some previews of the 3D printed jewelry we are working on. Feedback welcome!
Cheesy Flask Earrings with our cheese-in-a-flask logo, and the original Curd Nerd Jewelry: a 3D printed model of the protein structure of chymosin, the enzyme in rennet that causes milk to coagulate into cheese curds. Both a little over 1"" in size (3cm), and available at the $50 level.
We've also tried some 3D prints in solid metal of the chymosin enzyme. We really love the gold plated version on the left, but at the slightly larger size (~3/4 inch) that you see for the nickel plated one on the right. Metal prints are a bit more expensive, so we're offering this one at $70. Looks and feels a bit like a gold nugget.
Finally, if you're a huge fan of wearing your science next to your heart - here's a 3-tier pendant showing (1) the Fam20C kinase that is responsible for phosphorylating ceasein proteins so they form micelles, (2) the chymosin enzyme that cleaves one of the caseisn to coagulate milk, and (3) the Kappa casein that is cleaved by chymosin and is the lynchpin in cheese making. Note that these proteins structures of the human Fam20C and Kappa casein were worked out by our own team!
T-shirt DesignsHere is a preview of our T-shirt designs. Note that we've added a new Exclusive perk for our Narwhal stretch goal! Only available until we hit our $20K goal, so get them while they're hot!We're looking to add a cool slogan to these T-shirts, and we'd love your input - so post your ideas in the Comments section.
Our Team
The Real Vegan Cheese project is open to collaborators of all skill levels and from all walks of life. In October we will be entering our Real Vegan Cheese project into the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) synthetic biology competition. We are excited to be part of a larger global community consisting of students and biohackers from over 30 countries!
Impacts
We live in an unsustainable world. The cheese we eat today is produced by commercial dairy cows which, though they produce delicious milk and cheese, have an exceptionally large carbon footprint.  Even the U,N. Food and Agriculture Organization reports that the world's 1.5 billion cows emit dozens of polluting gases, including large amounts of methane. This methane gas is a leading contributor to global warming!
By creating an alternative pathway to cheese, we help the environment, increase access to tasty and healthy food, and support people who have already committed themselves to a smaller personal carbon footprint.Our team of scientists have an amazing reputation for being passionate contributors to technological and scientific innovation as well as social and environmental justice. We are excited to take this passion into the world and prove that we together through open science can make huge strides in technology while being socially and environmentally responsible. Together we can change the way the world values, creates and consumes cheese.
Health effects
Not only can we make Real Vegan Cheese that is better for the environment, we can also design it to be better for you:
For each of the four main proteins found in cheese, there are dozens of known genetic variants found in humans and in different breeds of cows. Some of these versions of the proteins are associated with various health benefits, or increased risks of allergic response. We have the opportunity to pick and choose the most desirable variants of these naturally occurring proteins, increasing health benefits and removing allergens.

There are clear health benefits to consuming milk proteins derived from humans versus cow milk proteins. This is made possible by expressing the genes that code for human milk proteins in yeast. Using human genes to make vegan milk may not be appetizing to everyone, so for you folks that love good old-fashioned cow cheeses, we’re also making a vegan cow cheese.

Risks & Challenges
The path to Real Vegan Cheese is not an easy one. The science and cheese-making processes pose certain challenges that must be addressed.
As a health conscious and ecologically responsible collective, we have our own concerns about our process. We do not want to produce food in a way that replicates the shortcomings of some existing Genetic Engineering companies. One of our major challenges will be to evaluate whether the technology we work with is safe. We will need to continually re-evaluate risks and design safe-guards that prevent or limit potential dangers to individuals, humanity or the planet as a whole.

The proteins we want them to produce are complex and designed by nature for animal systems.

that together, we could actually make a difference. Whatever it is to 
you, I hope you let it carry you towards action.
Thank
 you for your interest to read this far and for considering any measure 
of support for our efforts. Helping others just might be the best 
ride you ever take. Ride safe and ride free!

Monkey’s Uncle is a locally owned, family-friendly restaurant in the planning
stages in Griffin, GA.  At the Monkey’s Uncle we will offer delicious and
carefully prepared American fare, remarkable customer service, a large variety
of bottled and draught beer, and a welcoming atmosphere to create a dining experience
worth raving about.  Guests will design sandwiches, tacos, and burgers, choosing
from our unique and sometimes surprising list of accoutrements.  The
possibilities are endless! </p>
<p>We're committed to providing a comfortable and friendly dining room for families with children.  We will strategically create space
within the dining area that provides while-you-wait entertainment for kids of
all ages beyond the expected coloring page menu. In addition to kid-sized
portions of many of our regular menu offerings, our kids menu will include
healthy, real food options instead of the ‘prepackaged mac’n’cheese,
frozen chicken fingers, and corn dogs’ menus offered in other places. Our
kids menu will offer families of young children the kind of food they might prepare and serve at home.</p><h4><br/></h4><h4><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Who's Lee?</b></h4><p></p><p>Since my teens I've read Tolkien’s <u>The Lord of the Rings</u>
and imagined the hometown scene in The Prancing Pony of Bree, where the
friendly innkeeper and restaurateur welcomes all into his house for room and
board, waits on them hand and foot, and enjoys their company day in and day out.
That book became a dear friend to me, and the common room of the Prancing Pony became
a permanent, detailed, and lively scene in my mind.  I've long known I’d make a good master of the house
and dreamt of welcoming that company into my place each day, serving wonderful
food and encouraging a good time with friends and family.</p>
<p>Since then I've learned much about restaurants in the fast
food and fast casual segments, spending a little time with McDonald’s and a
long time with <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Chick-fil-A, including in the original and flagship location in
Hapeville, GA.  I've learned that timing
is everything, hospitality means the world, and that special things happen
around a comfortable table.</span></p>
<h4><br/></h4><h4><b><strike>Location, Location, Location!</strike> <i>Local community involvement!</i></b></h4><p>I've also learned that a local business doesn't last without
the support of its community, and that giving back to that community shouldn't
just be an option—it’s a responsibility.  The Monkey’s Uncle’s will be known for
community involvement. We will work with local teams and clubs,
support the arts in Griffin, and give time and resources to local non-profits
like the Hope Health Clinic, Spalding Samaritans, and Five Loaves and Two Fish
Food Pantry. Service that extends from the restaurant beyond its doors is a
real passion for us.</p><p>We also intend to develop relationships with local farmers and vendors and incorporate as much Georgia-grown food in our kitchen as possible. We are currently researching grass-fed beef options as well as Georgia produce options. If you have a resource you believe we should investigate, please get in touch with us. We want to find the best balance in profitability while offering Griffin a restaurant you can be proud to support.</p>

<h3>Top 10 Reasons you should help Reunite the Saffolds!</h3>
<p>10. Why wouldn't you want to reunite a good father with his wife &amp; daughters</p>
<p>9. You're helping the economy</p>
<p>8. You're making dreams come true... living in San Diego, creating jobs, and raising great children!</p>
<p>7. Stop this grown man from crying on YouTube!  Geez!</p>
<p>6. See more videos of these hillarious kids</p>
<p>5. Help some girls see the ocean for the first time ever.</p>
<p>4. Because it's good karma</p>
<p>3. Because we've been paying it forward for a long, long time</p>
<p>2. So we can do day care for you if you live in San Diego and need nights or weekends.</p>
<p>1. Come'on man!  Do you really need more reasons?  A family should be together!</p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My husband's name is Jason Saffold. He's been in Staffing for 10 years working in the corporate world. What made him successful is how much he cared for his employees... treating every person who walked through the door with respect and support.  How is that different?  Because he started as 'just a temp' himself and knew first hand how poorly some people treat 'temps'.  He vowed to be different, to help everyone even if he couldn't give them a job, he tried to help in some small way.  That attitude has paid off to the point that he... we as a family are now able to start our own staffing company and know we never need to treat our employees as just a dollar sign or a temp or anything but human beings.  We vow to take care of all of our employees!</p>
<p>I am Sue Ann and I run the best day care in Mason City Iowa... don't take my word for it, but ask all of my families who are so sad to see me go to San Diego.  But, I grew up there, my family is there, my happiness in the world is there.  My husband is now there running this business... but I am stuck in Iowa and desperately want to reunite with him.  My four daughters and I cry every night because he is such a great father, such an incredible person and is out there doing this all by himself trying to build a business, put people to work, put the money away to afford to move us there.  I plan on providing second and third shift and weekend day care in San Diego too... something so few provide.  As a daycare provider I can not really contribute much to our move, but at least I am keeping a roof over our heads.  My husband keeps telling me I must have an ""S"" tattooed on my chest for caring for our four daughters and up to 12 more children in my day care.  Yes, 16 kids a day is insanity!</p>
<p>By contributing to our campaign, you will reunite our family, our four daughters 3, 4, 9 and 10 with their dad, my husband Jason.  You will help us keep this business growing and creating job opportunities for people who often don't get a chance... a hand in the world.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $7,500</p>
<p>$2,000 first month's rent on a house in San Diego where I can run day care</p>
<p>$2,000 for deposit on the house</p>
<p>$2,400 for renting a U-Haul truck to move from Mason City Iowa to San Diego</p>
<p>$600 in gas to drive the truck across country</p>
<p>$500 plane ticket to fly Jason back to Iowa to move us to San Diego</p>
<p>$1000 for hotels and food cross country</p>
<p>In return for your contribution we will provide you with Jason's resume or interview consultation.  His consultation has resulted in thousands of people getting hired... so this is a very good value!</p>
<p>If we don't get the money in time... we are going to keep trying, so the money will still be used toward the move... it's just that the school year starts September 5 in San Diego and we want to move the family before then... and before it snows in Iowa in October!  Please help us reunite sooner than later!</p>
<p>If you're in San Diego, we can also offer to wave your application fee if you want to join my day care.</p>

<h3>The P.E.I. Dodgeball Club needs your help!</h3>
<p>Being from Prince Edward Island, Canada, It's a bit uncommon that many of us enjoy dodgeball. People would often associate our ""gentle island"" with sports like curling, golf and hockey.

<p>To those of us who play Dodgeball every Sunday, we are very passionate about the sport. We're always looking for new players and generally anyone who will come out to play. Being from a small province and playing a, obscure sport, it is often hard to get people to come out and play though we've managed.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Regulus Coffee House Company is a locally owned and operated business. We are located in the Portage Park neighborhood on the northwest side of Chicago.  Our neighbors welcomed us with open arms which thrilled us to no end. They have continued to show support and as we are nearing our one-year anniversary, we would like to show our thanks by fulfilling some dreams and suggestions made by them.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">There are many reasons why we wanted to open, amongst them being our passion for coffee and coffeehouses themselves. We look at them as being the original social network. We wanted to help our local economy by bringing a diverse clientele to the area, while adding what we thought was missing: a local coffee shop!  We believe there is a natural allure to the neighborhood coffeehouse and what it can do: educate, entertain, and even add positivity to the quality of life.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Times New Roman, serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">We jumped through the hoops required of opening a small business, using all the capital we had and then some. With the banks and business credits not being start-up friendly, we did what we could with what we had. We put countless hours, sleepless nights, and our hearts into what we call Regulus Coffee House Company. We did it! We opened, and it was awesome. The neighborhood was more ecstatic about the opening than we were, we think. That was the positive reinforcement we needed to hear/feel to confirm we made the best choices along the way. We are doing our best and growing in popularity but still lack what  is truly needed to make this work.</span></span></span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">It was our goal to create a space where people could run in for a quick fix before work, students could study, neighbors could meet and become friends, and community groups to conspire change. We wanted to give people an alternative to the big guys that run rampant in our city, trying our hardest to keep our quality high and our prices low. Our homey vibe urges people to hang out, get cozy, and read or surf the web while sipping from our one-of-a-kind, handmade (by a local artist!) mugs. We love to use local vendors when we can. When we cant we try and keep it within neighbor states. Our bakers are a neighborhood start-up with a great product. Our independent roaster, with over twenty years experience, has already established himself locally, and we can't get enough of his organic, fair trade selections. We have banded with neighboring businesses to create the Irving Austin Business District, who's goal it is to revitalize and beautify our neighborhood.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Our next step will be to expand our business to better service the needs of the community. This expansion includes both the physical footprint of Regulus and our in-house offerings. We have already opened our doors to local artists and performers so they can get themselves out there. What we have seen has been a talent in the area that had no neighborhood outlet, community groups with the need to mix the meeting venues up, and other local entrepreneurs that would like to hold workshops here.

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p>
</div></div>","Regulus Coffee House Company is a locally owned and operated business. We are located in the Portage Park neighborhood on the northwest side of Chicago.  Our neighbors welcomed us with open arms which thrilled us to no end. They have continued to show support and as we are nearing our one-year anniversary, we would like to show our thanks by fulfilling some dreams and suggestions made by them.
There are many reasons why we wanted to open, amongst them being our passion for coffee and coffeehouses themselves. We look at them as being the original social network. We wanted to help our local economy by bringing a diverse clientele to the area, while adding what we thought was missing: a local coffee shop!  We believe there is a natural allure to the neighborhood coffeehouse and what it can do: educate, entertain, and even add positivity to the quality of life.
We jumped through the hoops required of opening a small business, using all the capital we had and then some. With the banks and business credits not being start-up friendly, we did what we could with what we had. We put countless hours, sleepless nights, and our hearts into what we call Regulus Coffee House Company. We did it! We opened, and it was awesome. The neighborhood was more ecstatic about the opening than we were, we think. That was the positive reinforcement we needed to hear/feel to confirm we made the best choices along the way. We are doing our best and growing in popularity but still lack what  is truly needed to make this work.
It was our goal to create a space where people could run in for a quick fix before work, students could study, neighbors could meet and become friends, and community groups to conspire change. We wanted to give people an alternative to the big guys that run rampant in our city, trying our hardest to keep our quality high and our prices low. Our homey vibe urges people to hang out, get cozy, and read or surf the web while sipping from our one-of-a-kind, handmade (by a local artist!) mugs. We love to use local vendors when we can. When we cant we try and keep it within neighbor states. Our bakers are a neighborhood start-up with a great product. Our independent roaster, with over twenty years experience, has already established himself locally, and we can't get enough of his organic, fair trade selections. We have banded with neighboring businesses to create the Irving Austin Business District, who's goal it is to revitalize and beautify our neighborhood.
Our next step will be to expand our business to better service the needs of the community. This expansion includes both the physical footprint of Regulus and our in-house offerings. We have already opened our doors to local artists and performers so they can get themselves out there. What we have seen has been a talent in the area that had no neighborhood outlet, community groups with the need to mix the meeting venues up, and other local entrepreneurs that would like to hold workshops here. We would like a larger space for those groups to gather for workshops, fundraisers, art shows, etc. Regulus regulars have expressed an interest in a larger menu that would include lunch items. We aim to please and have been talking to vendors for said items, but as of right now, we are short on space to accommodate very much extra in that area.

That is not why I share her story here and why I chose to help her raise funds. Cindy is an amazing woman with a rich story of love and service.</p><p>Cindy has been a teacher in North Carolina for near three decades. Firm, effective, and loving in her classroom. I have met adults that had Mrs. Orsillo as their teacher when they were children and they remember her most fondly. A very active member of her fellowship's youth program, a go to woman for education and church responsibilities. When Cindy is not filling in where she is needed, she is also a GED instructor for adults and Bible studies teacher for children. To be frank, I will just say her kids (awesome kids, btw) do not live in a gated community. Cindy is a teacher, completely and wholly. Besides, of course being simply wonderful her.</p><p>I don't need community members to tell me that my husband's mom is great, but they do, time and time again.</p><p>For the last few years, Cindy has traveled and returned to Africa to continue what she loves with people (seemingly to me) she was destined to connect with. Her stays in Africa are more than casual voluntourism. Cindy has formed working and lasting relationships with the people, children, and co-creators of the projects that arise out of need in South Africa. Needs like digging and helping install a clean water well / system for an elementary school. She comes to Africa with her teaching experience, but gives more than that where she is called.<br/></p><p>Cindy raises the funding and asks loved ones to contribute what and where they are able. Most of her fund raising has been traditional; letters, asking family, and putting together car washes. Her church also contributes towards expenses for the children in Africa. Cindy's expense comes down to plane ticket and lodging. I know that any money beyond that would be spent on providing goods or contributing to the community that hosts her. I know because that is the way my mother in law rolls.</p><p>Children in Africa and the U.S. LOVE Mrs. Orsillo (even if they don't always like her ;) Every trip that she makes to South Africa not only directly makes a difference in people's lives there, but inspires many people here to BE more. Cindy encourages love, dedication, and growth through her actions. Her reputation precedes her and inspires others to do what they love and fulfill their destiny.</p><p>If you are like her or want to be more like Cindy, in solidarity...contribute, share this, talk about he,r and inspire other kindreds. We all make a difference, sometimes directly and at times vicariously (for now, until we do it too!)<br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; Perks</h3><p>What is needed?</p><p>Plane ticket fare  $2600</p><p>Lodging expense $150</p><p>All monies will go towards fare and lodging. If Cindy's campaign is overabundant I have every confidence that all extra monies would be used with great care and conscience.<br/></p><p><b>Perks!</b></p><p>I will be adding perks as I find them or as supporters donate perks. If you have something to give in this way, please message me. So, keep up with our updates. I do have some ideas that are for local friends and friends abroad.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Lives really are touched by You.<br/>
</h3>Cindy will mulch a path, tutor a child, hold a baby, dig a well, build a house...with little or no request made at all. It was not Africa, it was in Missouri in a community that was growing, where I lived that I firs experienced Cindy's drive to be or service. In my community (I lived off grid in a growing village), whenever Cindy saw work to be done or children to be celebrated or soothed, SHE was there.

That is not why I share her story here and why I chose to help her raise funds. Cindy is an amazing woman with a rich story of love and service.Cindy has been a teacher in North Carolina for near three decades. Firm, effective, and loving in her classroom. I have met adults that had Mrs. Orsillo as their teacher when they were children and they remember her most fondly. A very active member of her fellowship's youth program, a go to woman for education and church responsibilities. When Cindy is not filling in where she is needed, she is also a GED instructor for adults and Bible studies teacher for children. To be frank, I will just say her kids (awesome kids, btw) do not live in a gated community. Cindy is a teacher, completely and wholly. Besides, of course being simply wonderful her.I don't need community members to tell me that my husband's mom is great, but they do, time and time again.For the last few years, Cindy has traveled and returned to Africa to continue what she loves with people (seemingly to me) she was destined to connect with. Her stays in Africa are more than casual voluntourism. Cindy has formed working and lasting relationships with the people, children, and co-creators of the projects that arise out of need in South Africa. Needs like digging and helping install a clean water well / system for an elementary school. She comes to Africa with her teaching experience, but gives more than that where she is called.Cindy raises the funding and asks loved ones to contribute what and where they are able. Most of her fund raising has been traditional; letters, asking family, and putting together car washes. Her church also contributes towards expenses for the children in Africa. Cindy's expense comes down to plane ticket and lodging. I know that any money beyond that would be spent on providing goods or contributing to the community that hosts her. I know because that is the way my mother in law rolls.Children in Africa and the U.S. LOVE Mrs. Orsillo (even if they don't always like her ;) Every trip that she makes to South Africa not only directly makes a difference in people's lives there, but inspires many people here to BE more. Cindy encourages love, dedication, and growth through her actions. Her reputation precedes her and inspires others to do what they love and fulfill their destiny.If you are like her or want to be more like Cindy, in solidarity...contribute, share this, talk about he,r and inspire other kindreds. We all make a difference, sometimes directly and at times vicariously (for now, until we do it too!)What We Need & PerksWhat is needed?Plane ticket fare  $2600Lodging expense $150All monies will go towards fare and lodging. If Cindy's campaign is overabundant I have every confidence that all extra monies would be used with great care and conscience.Perks!I will be adding perks as I find them or as supporters donate perks. If you have something to give in this way, please message me. So, keep up with our updates. I do have some ideas that are for local friends and friends abroad.Lives really are touched by You.
Cindy will mulch a path, tutor a child, hold a baby, dig a well, build a house...with little or no request made at all. It was not Africa, it was in Missouri in a community that was growing, where I lived that I firs experienced Cindy's drive to be or service. In my community (I lived off grid in a growing village), whenever Cindy saw work to be done or children to be celebrated or soothed, SHE was there. I was bed ridden and would watch through my window, my guest work and serve and commune with kind hearted strangers to her. My heart was so full and grateful that I was apart of her family. I mean, I was already sold by her amazing son, but I knew where he came from after watching his mom about the village.Her kindness hasn't ceased one bit over the years.

She will return, her story will continue and generations of men and women will want to give to the world, near and far, as Cindy Orsillo gives of herself.More than one way to help? Of course!

their food traditions.<span>  While in Italy,
we will be given many opportunities for cross-cultural learning, to share food movement
success stories and lessons learned, and to build relationships and bring new ideas back to the challenges still to be met

As a seafood wholesaler on
the historic Union Wharf in Portland, Maine, I’ve been working to help our company shift
direction from a retail seafood shipping company to a more localized seafood

milk from very rare Randall cows and Jersey cows. At Winter Hill, where they

I am honored and
excited to announce that I have been chosen as one of just 240 US delegates to attend
Slow Food’s 2014 Terra Madre & Salone del Gusto global food conference from October 23-27 in Turin, Italy.
Delegates from over
130 countries are selected for their ability to represent their country, and
their food traditions.  While in Italy,
we will be given many opportunities for cross-cultural learning, to share food movement
success stories and lessons learned, and to build relationships and bring new ideas back to the challenges still to be met
at home. 

As a beginning cheese-maker
and a selected delegate to the conference, I’m hoping for support to cover
travel costs, and possibly even make some additional visits to creameries after
the conference to maximize this learning experience. I want to learn as much as I can to deepen my education about artisan style cheese making and

No more tangles during your travel.  No more tangles during workouts with long cords that gets in the way.  Now you can adjust your cords length, protect and use it with your imagination.  Such as wear it around your wrist and even use it as a cell phone stand"".  - Peter Chin, Inventor

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>My Name is Josh and I started riding motorcycles about 4 years ago. My first bike was a 1980 Honda XL250 which I owned for 3 years. My friend introduced me to dirt riding and soon after I upgraded my bike to a KLR in 2013. Since then I've done a few moto-camping trips, some over weekends and another over 10 days. It's an addiction thats taken over my life and if you've ever ridden a motorcycle you understand the itch to just hit the road and go. </p><p>I'm planning to leave my job in late June or early July to head to a KLR Rally in Colorado. I'm leaving a few weeks early in order to explore the west coast and enjoy life on the road, camping off the bike and living as minimally as possible. This trip is a big life changer for me because I've never traveled outside of my home state on my bike, nor have I ever committed to such an adventure.

My first bike was a 1980 Honda XL250 which I owned for 3 years. My friend introduced me to dirt riding and soon after I upgraded my bike to a KLR in 2013. Since then I've done a few moto-camping trips, some over weekends and another over 10 days. It's an addiction thats taken over my life and if you've ever ridden a motorcycle you understand the itch to just hit the road and go. I'm planning to leave my job in late June or early July to head to a KLR Rally in Colorado. I'm leaving a few weeks early in order to explore the west coast and enjoy life on the road, camping off the bike and living as minimally as possible. This trip is a big life changer for me because I've never traveled outside of my home state on my bike, nor have I ever committed to such an adventure. I don't plan on returning home immediately after the rally and I would like to eventually continue on into Mexico and Central America afterwards. This campaign would be helpful in many ways, assuring I'll have money for emergencies, supplies and repairs for the bike.

Thank you for checking out our Indiegogo campaign today! </h3><p>Kevin is a barista by day/singer-songwriter by night, and Brooke works for a non-profit organization. They live in Nashville, Tennessee with two pups named Koola &amp; Khloe.</p><p><span><b>We
 always dreamed of becoming parents one day.</b> After receiving the diagnosis
 that we would not be able to have children on our
own, the dream didn’t go away. We don’t consider it so much as <i>choosing </i>to adopt, but that <b>this is what was meant for us our entire lives.</b></span><br/><br/><b>We are currently on the waiting list</b> and at any moment (!!!) a birth mom could see our profile and pick us to raise her child. To be trusted enough to raise someone else's child is such an enormous responsibility and something we don't take lightly. We are completely humbled to be given this opportunity to be parents.<br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>Our domestic infant adoption will cost roughly <b>$20,000</b> once all is said and done. We've already paid for some administrative costs, such as the home study and the birth mother fee. The placement fee is due after a child is placed in our home, and then we will have to cover additional legal fees, which can vary drastically in cost.<br/><br/><ul>

<li>Legal fees after placement = unknown</li>
</ul><p>The purpose of this campaign is to help with the cost of the placement fee <strong>only</strong>. Our goal is to raise $5,000, about half of the final fee to adopt a child.

<p>On Wednesday, June 12, 2013, Mark passed away unexpectedly leaving behind his loving wife Stacey and two beautiful children, Joshua (8) and Emily (4).  There are a lot of words one could use to describe Mark...Loyal, devoted, hardworking, trustworthy, just to name a few.  Above all, he was a family man, putting his wife and kids ahead of everything else.  His absence will be greatly felt, but his memories will live on forever in all that had the pleasure of knowing him.  We are hoping to raise at least $2500 to help Stacey and the children through the trying times that are still to come...bills to be paid, daycare expenses, and so many other unexpected expenses along the way.  No gift is too small...all funds will go directly to Stacey to help ease the worry she may have for providing for her family.</p>

We took this tiny sum along with our own money to qualify for a start-up loan through local microlender <a href=""http://peoplefund.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PeopleFund</a>, and rebuilt 1819 Rosewood to set up a daily access point for farm-fresh as well as conventional produce and healthy snacks.</p><p>As we have grown, we have been able to accept SNAP benefits and diversify the products on our shelves. In response to community input, we recently added a <a href=""http://rosewoodfood.com/menu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Daily Menu</a>, which includes healthy sandwiches, salads, fresh juice and smoothies—all at affordable prices and made from the products we carry in the store. The store is designed around sustainability and minimal waste, with all food waste going into the neighborhood compost cycle via the <a href=""https://www.compostpedallers.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">East Side Compost Pedallers</a>.<br/></p><p>We at Rosewood believe that if communities have regular and affordable access to healthy food options grown and produced close to home, have a say in what their neighborhood stores carry and have a stake in seeing those options become a reality, all demographics of that community will benefit. We also believe that if this model can work at Rosewood, it can be a template for other neighborhoods and communities across the United States to help address their own food access and security issues.<br/></p><p></p><h2>Why is Rosewood becoming a co-op?<br/>
</h2>Rosewood Community Market is transitioning into a food co-op because the cooperative model is built around the ideals of sustainability, affordability and involvement. This is especially important for this market, which resides in the heart of one of Austin's most economically, demographically and ethnically diverse neighborhoods. A cooperative gives the market a chance to engage all members of the community and allows neighbors the opportunity to support one another on a daily basis.<br/><p></p><p>Rosewood Community Market will be East Austin's first cooperative 
grocery store. The corner of Rosewood and Chicon and the 
surrounding area was considered a USDA food desert prior to the opening 
of Rosewood Community Market. In previous generations, the neighborhood 
had a number of food and grocery options, however over the last several decades, the neighborhood has lost its connection to the experience of having fresh food accessible and available. The cooperative is an 
effort to re-establish the community's connection to its historical foodways and allow for a voice from all members of the neighborhood about what they want to see from their food providers.<br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h2>What will my donation to Rosewood go to support?<br/>
</h2>The key to the entire concept behind this market hinges on access. Every dollar donated to this campaign will help Rosewood improve neighborhood access and increase its capacity for operations and community outreach.<p></p><h4>Increase product availability and consistency</h4>Rosewood has established many strong relationships with local growers, producers and distributors. With your help, we can maximize these relationships to meet our customers' requests for products. We see Rosewood as the one-stop shop for anyone looking to make a meal or stock their kitchen with fresh food products. Increased consistency will ultimately drive up patronage and co-op membership, allowing the cooperative better wholesale buying power and lower prices for high quality products at a convenient neighborhood level.<p></p><h4>Create viable employment opportunities</h4><p>Rosewood has had the good fortune of having many dedicated part-time employees and volunteers contribute to its success through the first 11 months of operation. However, it has always been the goal of Rosewood to create sustainable, living-wage employment opportunities for hard-working individuals who want to learn and grow with our organization. Funds from this campaign will be earmarked to hire Rosewood's first full-time general manager, who will build upon the operational strategy for the store front and its subsidiary activities.<br/></p><h4>Engage the community</h4><p>The money raised will help Rosewood be at the forefront of an on-the-ground campaign to increase fresh food access in our neighborhood and beyond. We are a small organization, but believe we can be a model for giving our food system and our consuming habits a nudge in the right direction. For example, the new cooperative will be a catalyst in the creation of a <a href=""http://foodfitphilly.org/eat-healthy/healthy-corner-stores/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.healthycornerstores.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Healthy Corner Store Program</a> in the City of Austin. Additional priorities include the support and development of community gardens, urban gardening education and cooking literacy.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><h2>What are the perks for supporting Rosewood?</h2>Aside from being part of what we believe to be a very special project and an opportunity to make a real difference in our economic and food systems in a small yet high-impact way, we have tried to put together some one-of-a-kind incentives as a sign of appreciation for your support. Check back regularly throughout the campaign for new limited-edition rewards!<p>If you choose to support us at a membership level, you will become a founding member of the cooperative or have the ability to sponsor a membership for another member of our community. A lifetime membership to the Rosewood Community Market guarantees access to members-only specials as well as the opportunity to shape the future of the market. The Rosewood Community Market is currently under the guidance of a steering committee that will establish the cooperative, write its charter by-laws, and set the date for the first member meeting. Once the founding members elect Rosewood's first board, it is up to us as a community to direct the future operations of the store.</p><br/><p></p><p><b></b></p><h2><b>What challenges does Rosewood face?<br/></b></h2><p></p><p>Rosewood Community Market has dealt with many of the typical issues a new, small business encounters in its first year. But beyond the daily grind and slim margins of a neighborhood grocery, Rosewood faces several challenges unique to its location, model and mission.</p><h4>Product Availability</h4><p>A top priority of the co-op is to make Rosewood a viable, one-stop shop for its members and patrons. But we are limited on space, parking and visibility due to our location in the neighborhood, so it can make getting new patrons in the door a challenge. When they do come in, they can sometimes be confronted with a fluctuating inventory and may find the store does not meet their expectations. The cooperative hopes to address this challenge by increasing its customer baseline and establishing a standard for product purchases through more predictable sales expectations. As we move forward, Rosewood has a great advantage in this regard because we have the first year of operations in the books so it is possible to gauge for the coming seasons.<br/></p><h4>Affordability</h4><p>How do you keep fresh and local food affordable? It's one of the toughest questions we have to address. It's also one of the most important to try and figure out. Some of it is finding creative ways to source our products, some is limiting non-food costs and overhead, and some is engaging consumers in the conversation about what good food is actually worth. What is it worth to us to eat fresh, quality food grown close to home and consume products made and distributed locally? There are still more questions than answers in this realm, but it is part of why Rosewood exists.<br/></p><h4>Servicing a Diverse Community</h4><p>Rosewood Community Market is uniquely positioned to service a diverse mix of potential patrons. But with that comes the challenge of satisfying the needs of many different groups--culturally, geographically and economically. The corner of Rosewood and Chicon resides in one of Austin's historically African American neighborhoods. The surrounding east side is also home to many Hispanic and Latino households, many of whom have lived in the area for multiple generations. In recent years, parts of the area have been in transition, with many young professionals, students and artists moving in and out of the neighborhood. The market is positioned between several subsidized and affordable housing apartment complexes, near a couple of schools and just off the beaten path from a more intensely developed commercial district near Highway 35. With so many different audiences within a one-mile radius, it will take ongoing work to determine what will best serve the needs of the entire community. Yet we know that everyone should have access to fresh local food, and we believe that this foundation has incredible power to bring people together, no matter their backgrounds.<br/></p><p></p><h4>Reestablishing Neighborhood Food Culture</h4><p>As previously mentioned, the area where the market is located was once plentiful with neighborhood grocery options. But generations have passed since that was an actuality for the area and with that void of presence has come an expectation, or lack thereof. It will take time to establish the market and have people in the neighborhood understand what it is about, why it is there and trust that it will stick around. <br/></p><h4>Creating a Community Value of Local Food</h4><p>Tying into the idea of affordability is also the challenge of creating a value of local food. Many people may find it hard to understand why local food is important or relevant. Some may find it difficult to justify spending more on a bunch of local carrots at the neighborhood cooperative than they would for a similar sized bunch at the chain grocery a few miles away. That speaks to the larger conversation in which we are trying to participate. What is the actual value of food, particularly local food? Why is it worth it? Why should we consider where and how many of our dollars are spent on what? These are not easy questions to answer, but Rosewood is willing to be a place where anyone can feel comfortable engaging in the conversation. </p><p></p><div>

The mission of Rosewood Community Market is simple.
We want to bring fresh and local food to the areas of 
Austin that need it most. We want that food to be approachable, 
accessible and affordable. We want to support as many local producers as possible, to serve our neighborhood and surrounding areas as best we can
 and give back to our community as much as we can.With your help, Rosewood Community Market will:
be East Austin's first cooperative grocery store

be fully financially sustainable and economically viable

provide our community with consistent access to healthy and nutritious food

Laminaria and bladder wrack</span></b>-  are powerful ingredients as they draws an
extraordinary wealth of mineral elements from the sea that can account for up
to 36% of they dry mass. These include sodium, calcium, magnesium, potassium,
chlorine, sulfur and phosphorus; the micronutrients include iodine, iron, zinc,
copper, selenium, molybdenum, fluoride, manganese, boron, nickel and cobalt.<br/><b>This *natural mix* is suppose to be massaged into the skin, resulting in
skin stimulation and detoxification</b><br/>
(*Massage - allowing nutrients and anti-oxidants to be absorbed into the skin –
detoxifying, hydrating, and healing as it dries). <br/><b><u><span>Recipe:</span></u></b><br/>
*Cambrian blue clay (50%)  + laminaria (25%) + bladder wrack (25%) – is a 100% vegan, 100% natural and powerful mask for all skin types…<br/><span>Take: 3 – 4 tsp. of Cambrian blue clay
powder, ½ tsp. of laminaria powder, and ½ tsp. of bladder wrack powder.<br/>
Mix all these dry ingredients together in a glass, or plastic bowl.<br/><b>*Do not use any metal staff. <br/>*Use a glass or plastic bowl, and glass,
plastic or wood spoon / stick.</b><br/>
Pour clean water over this *mixture* (using approximately 40% - 50% water).<br/>
Stir the *mixture* with a plastic, glass or wooden spoon / stick - until they
are thoroughly blended (...you should get a smooth, spreadable paste – …like a
good sour crème).<br/>
But, the consistency of the paste is up to you (…you can experiment, and make
the mask thicker, or thinner).<br/>
Gently massage this mask into your skin for several minutes.<br/>
Then, spread evenly over the face and leave to dry (for 15-20 minutes).<br/>
Remove / wash off with warm water.<br/>
If you want, you can use your favorite moisturizer to nourish the skin
afterwards.</span></p><p></p><h3><span><span><b><span>*PLEASE

«Cambrian Blue Clay» - is one of the best kept beauty and medical Secrets of the modern world…CAMBRIAN PERIODThe Cambrian (/ˈkæmbriən/) is the first geological
period of the Paleozoic Era, lasting from 541.0 ± 1.0 to 485.4 ± 1.9 million
years ago (mya) and is succeeded by the Ordovician. The
period was established by Adam Sedgwick, who named it after Cambria, the Latin
name for Wales, where Britain's Cambrian rocks are best exposed.
The Cambrian Period marked a profound change in life
on Earth; prior to the Cambrian, living organisms on the whole
were small, unicellular and simple. Complex, “multicellular” organisms
gradually became more common in the millions of years immediately preceding the
Cambrian, but it was not until this period that mineralized – hence readily
fossilized – organisms became common. The rapid diversification of life forms in the Cambrian, known as the Cambrian explosion, produced the first
representatives of all modern animal phyla.(wikipedia.org)




NORTH-WEST REGION OF RUSSIA( LENINGRAD REGION )
During the Cambrian period, the continents and seas differed from present day
configurations. Four major continents, Gondwanaland, Angara, and the two sections of
Euramerica, were inundated with a rising sea level; accumulating thick
sedimentary deposits.At that time, the Russian Lower Cambrian subdivision - Siberia separated
from the supercontinent to form an isolated land mass. Over the 600 million years Siberia shifted, morphed,
and eventually became land -  locked in the Eurasian continent (*During the Pleistocene epoch, great continental ice
sheets scoured and depressed the shield's surface - and the ancient rocks have
yielded a rich variety of minerals…). In Russia, the Cambrian beds are remarkable in that they comprise mostly undisturbed and unconsolidated sand and clay despite their great age.*During this period early sediment began to form of what is now known as the Cambrian blue clay. 
""Leningrad region"" - an ecological pearl of the North-West
Russia, and has an absolutely unique structure of the subsoil.There is no any other place on the plains of Russia
where you can find such a complete set of outputs of ancient rocks - ranging in age from Archaean to the Late Paleozoic. In the basis of the Paleozoic sediments - are
sandstone and Cambrian blue clay, the age of which is about 600 million years.
This is due to the fact, that the Leningrad region
lies at the junction of two major structures of the earth’s crust - on the
southern edge of the Baltic Shield’s crystalline bedrock and Eastern European
Platform. Together they form the East European (Russian) platform - where its
Pre-Cambrian folded basement emerges on the surface.

MAIN  COSMETIC  RECIPIESWITH CAMBRIAN BLUE CLAY
Most of skincare products, which have been made with the use of Cambrian
blue clay (...or other type of clay) - contain just small amount of it. But, if
you just spend some time, take the pure Cambrian blue clay powder, and simply
mix it to a paste with spring water (...or, add seaweeds, herbal powders, herbs
extracts, natural oils) – you will get 100% natural, and highly effective
cosmetic, and healing product *MADE BY YOURSELF*.The benefits of making your own cosmetics will be immediately evident: your new
products will smell and feel good, and so will your skin and body.

Universal & Powerful Facial Mask: 

Cambrian blue clay + Laminaria powder +  Bladder wrack powder
Laminaria and bladder wrack-  are powerful ingredients as they draws an
extraordinary wealth of mineral elements from the sea that can account for up
to 36% of they dry mass. These include sodium, calcium, magnesium, potassium,
chlorine, sulfur and phosphorus; the micronutrients include iodine, iron, zinc,
copper, selenium, molybdenum, fluoride, manganese, boron, nickel and cobalt.This *natural mix* is suppose to be massaged into the skin, resulting in
skin stimulation and detoxification
(*Massage - allowing nutrients and anti-oxidants to be absorbed into the skin –
detoxifying, hydrating, and healing as it dries). Recipe:
*Cambrian blue clay (50%)  + laminaria (25%) + bladder wrack (25%) – is a 100% vegan, 100% natural and powerful mask for all skin types…Take: 3 – 4 tsp. of Cambrian blue clay
powder, ½ tsp. of laminaria powder, and ½ tsp. of bladder wrack powder.
Mix all these dry ingredients together in a glass, or plastic bowl.*Do not use any metal staff. *Use a glass or plastic bowl, and glass,
plastic or wood spoon / stick.
Pour clean water over this *mixture* (using approximately 40% - 50% water).
Stir the *mixture* with a plastic, glass or wooden spoon / stick - until they
are thoroughly blended (...you should get a smooth, spreadable paste – …like a
good sour crème).
But, the consistency of the paste is up to you (…you can experiment, and make
the mask thicker, or thinner).
Gently massage this mask into your skin for several minutes.
Then, spread evenly over the face and leave to dry (for 15-20 minutes).
Remove / wash off with warm water.
If you want, you can use your favorite moisturizer to nourish the skin
afterwards.*PLEASE
NOTE: You may want to avoid laminaria, and bladder wrack -
if you have an iodine allergy or sensitivity. ***Facial
masks with Cambrian blue clay are extremely beneficial for your skin - ...masks help to draw impurities from the skin, leaving it
radiant, free from dirt, and healthy-looking. ***With Regular uses - lifts your
skin, makes it elastic and evens out skin tone.

</h3> <p>Well...most of you know the long and short of it; starting a company can be very difficult, stressful and challenging.

<p>I also believe this center can have a valuable impact on our home town of Hamburg and the surrounding suburbs of Buffalo, NY.  And yes, this is the same Buffalo known for chicken wings, blizzards, 2 Stanley Cup loses and 4 straight Superbowl loses. But what people don't know unless they visit here is how amazing this area and community are.  Friendly and inviting people always willing to help out a neighbor, and support a good cause.

<h1><b></b></h1><p><b style=""font-size: 36px; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 40px;"">Epigaze Audio: Who We Are</b><br/></p>
<p>Hello Everybody! For those of you who do not know me, my
name is Josh Alley, I run and operate Epigaze Audio. For the past year I have
taken the dream of Epigaze Audio from a side project to a full-scale business. Epigaze Audio is committed to offering the best pedals available at reasonable prices for the modern day guitarist. In any business there are growing pains and I feel I have done a great job so
far with keeping up with demand and all of the interest in my products. I have
great plans for the future of Epigaze Audio and this where your help is greatly
appreciated!</p>
<p>The sole purpose of this campaign is to help Epigaze Audio
maximize it’s potential growth and better service all of it’s customers and
dealers.</p>
<h3><b>How Your Contributions Will Help</b></h3>
<p>Below I have explained the key points that your
contributions will help come to live.</p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Legal Administration
/ Aid: One of the biggest hurdles for growth is acquiring the appropriate
funding. Your contribution will help curve the cost that will be needed to gain
the acceptance of investors in Epigaze Audio.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Tools &amp;
Equipment: To keep up with the ever increasing demand in Epigaze Audio
products, new tools and equipment are required to streamline the production
while still keeping true to our hand-build tradition.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Workspace &amp;
Storage: With additional production, more space is needed to provide an adequate
working environment and proper storage for equipment, materials, pedals in
production, packaging, and shipping.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Inventory: One
of the most important points I want to accomplish is to constantly have an
inventory of finished products available at all times to abolish and/or
drastically reduce turnaround times. To date all of my customers have been
great with the current 2-3 week turnaround time, but I want to offer my
customers a higher level of service.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul><h3><b>The Impact</b></h3>
<p>Epigaze Audio is more than just a guitar pedal company. I
have had the privilege of gaining some great friends and a thriving community
of musicians, builders, merchants, and artists. Everything I do with Epigaze
Audio I do with a mindset of 110%. Everyone deserves a great product, with
stunning graphics, attention to detail and quality components, and outstanding
build quality and durability. I stand by every single product 100%, and I am looking
forward to expanding on an already excellent business model with all of you at
my side. Thank you to all of my frends, family, and customers who have taken me
this far already. Now is the time that I ask you to help carry Epigaze Audio one-step
further. Cheers!</p>

<p></p></div>","Epigaze Audio: Who We Are
Hello Everybody! For those of you who do not know me, my
name is Josh Alley, I run and operate Epigaze Audio. For the past year I have
taken the dream of Epigaze Audio from a side project to a full-scale business. Epigaze Audio is committed to offering the best pedals available at reasonable prices for the modern day guitarist. In any business there are growing pains and I feel I have done a great job so
far with keeping up with demand and all of the interest in my products. I have
great plans for the future of Epigaze Audio and this where your help is greatly
appreciated!
The sole purpose of this campaign is to help Epigaze Audio
maximize it’s potential growth and better service all of it’s customers and
dealers.
How Your Contributions Will Help
Below I have explained the key points that your
contributions will help come to live.


Legal Administration
/ Aid: One of the biggest hurdles for growth is acquiring the appropriate
funding. Your contribution will help curve the cost that will be needed to gain
the acceptance of investors in Epigaze Audio.


Tools &
Equipment: To keep up with the ever increasing demand in Epigaze Audio
products, new tools and equipment are required to streamline the production
while still keeping true to our hand-build tradition.


Workspace &
Storage: With additional production, more space is needed to provide an adequate
working environment and proper storage for equipment, materials, pedals in
production, packaging, and shipping.


Inventory: One
of the most important points I want to accomplish is to constantly have an
inventory of finished products available at all times to abolish and/or
drastically reduce turnaround times. To date all of my customers have been
great with the current 2-3 week turnaround time, but I want to offer my
customers a higher level of service.

The Impact
Epigaze Audio is more than just a guitar pedal company. I
have had the privilege of gaining some great friends and a thriving community
of musicians, builders, merchants, and artists. Everything I do with Epigaze
Audio I do with a mindset of 110%. Everyone deserves a great product, with
stunning graphics, attention to detail and quality components, and outstanding
build quality and durability. I stand by every single product 100%, and I am looking
forward to expanding on an already excellent business model with all of you at
my side. Thank you to all of my frends, family, and customers who have taken me
this far already. Now is the time that I ask you to help carry Epigaze Audio one-step
further. Cheers!

Everyday I am discovering a deeper connection with South Africa and finding a greater sense of purpose in teaching Fisantekraal youth about bikes. The youth in this community face huge disadvantages and difficulties.  I know the bike club is making a real difference and is much loved by all members. I'm running this campaign to raise funds to purchase more used bikes and parts, as well as run events to keep the bike club going! <div>

<h3>Where is Fisantekraal Bike Club?

</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Our bike club runs out of a shipping container at the back of Fisantekraal High School.  <a href=""http://www.google.co.nz/maps/ms?msid=205217353120440283175.0004dc602686c342cc479&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=-33.7825,18.718021&amp;spn=0.010629,0.021136"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fisantekraal</a> is a rural township near Cape Town in South Africa formed at the end of apartheid by rural workers forced to move off landholders' farms. Only one in five adults in the township have completed high school and the youth lack educated role models.  <img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/833143/files/20140904015353-highschool.jpg?1409820833"" src="""" style=""""/>The community petitioned for a school of their own for many years and finally Fisantekraal High School was built; the school roll is now around 900 and the first learners will matriculate this year.  This school is a proud heart of the community.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why a bike club?</h3>
<p></p>
<p><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/835083/files/20140904195603-shellycircle.jpg?1409885763"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The township is isolated and ownership of a bicycle, and the skills to maintain it, significantly improves the lives of our young bike mechanics.  The self confidence that comes from knowing you have built your bike yourself stands our club members in good stead.  The ability to travel, with the closest town 10km away, is hugely valued by our teenagers.  For the members who are matriculating, their bicycle will provide them transport to job interviews and further training. The healthy community atmosphere created in bike shop fosters friendships across different ages. It is heart warming to see the older, more experienced members helping the younger children. 
<p>The bike club is appreciated by the parents of our members as well as the youth, with adults sometimes stopping by to pump tires and to see what their kids are raving about.</p>

<p>Peace and Love International (PLI) is a Canadian NGO that has been running various programs at Fisantekraal High School since the school's inauguration in 2012. Current programs include tutoring, scholarship assistance and our bustling bike club! </p>
<p>Beeyond a Bike (BaB) is a grass-roots initiative of a Canadian bicycle mechanic and traveling cyclist named Brenna Coupland whose mission is to empower communities through bicycle accessibility and mechanical education.</p>
<p>In 2011, a Claremont Rotary member donated the 6x3 m shipping container which now houses our bike club.  Claremont Rotary also helped with the transport of 14 used bicycles donated by Canadian Rotary branches to Peace and Love International. THANK YOU ROTARY! From the bike and shipping container donations a vision for a bike program at Fisantekraal High School was born! Conversations between BaB and PLI began and the two collaborated to develop a pedal-powered program to launch at the high school in 2014!</p>

Over a course of 6-8 weeks, students attend regular workshop classes with a trained and enthusiastic instructor (read: bike geek) and fix a used bicycle.

<br/><p>Our latest dream is a team! We now have ten cycling enthusiasts with working bicycles and we are growing 'wheely' fast. We are ready to get involved in races and events and want to make it happen as a team. To do so, we need cycling jerseys and shorts for all team members as well as entrance fees and general participation costs (transportation, food accommodation) per event. To participate in mountain bike events, we will need approximately 12 mountain bikes for the team members to share. </p>

</div> <p>THANK YOU so much for your support.</p></div>","Hi! My name is Brenna Coupland I'm a Canadian bicycle mechanic and founder of the Fisantekraal Bike Club! In partnership with the NGO Peace and Love International and Beeyond a Bike, I facilitate an educational bike program at Fisantekraal High School. Everyday I am discovering a deeper connection with South Africa and finding a greater sense of purpose in teaching Fisantekraal youth about bikes. The youth in this community face huge disadvantages and difficulties.  I know the bike club is making a real difference and is much loved by all members. I'm running this campaign to raise funds to purchase more used bikes and parts, as well as run events to keep the bike club going! 

Where is Fisantekraal Bike Club?



Our bike club runs out of a shipping container at the back of Fisantekraal High School.  Fisantekraal is a rural township near Cape Town in South Africa formed at the end of apartheid by rural workers forced to move off landholders' farms. Only one in five adults in the township have completed high school and the youth lack educated role models.  The community petitioned for a school of their own for many years and finally Fisantekraal High School was built; the school roll is now around 900 and the first learners will matriculate this year.  This school is a proud heart of the community.

Why a bike club?

The township is isolated and ownership of a bicycle, and the skills to maintain it, significantly improves the lives of our young bike mechanics.  The self confidence that comes from knowing you have built your bike yourself stands our club members in good stead.  The ability to travel, with the closest town 10km away, is hugely valued by our teenagers.  For the members who are matriculating, their bicycle will provide them transport to job interviews and further training. The healthy community atmosphere created in bike shop fosters friendships across different ages. It is heart warming to see the older, more experienced members helping the younger children. 
The bike club is appreciated by the parents of our members as well as the youth, with adults sometimes stopping by to pump tires and to see what their kids are raving about.


Who we are: Peace and Love International and Beyond a Bike


Peace and Love International (PLI) is a Canadian NGO that has been running various programs at Fisantekraal High School since the school's inauguration in 2012. Current programs include tutoring, scholarship assistance and our bustling bike club! 
Beeyond a Bike (BaB) is a grass-roots initiative of a Canadian bicycle mechanic and traveling cyclist named Brenna Coupland whose mission is to empower communities through bicycle accessibility and mechanical education.
In 2011, a Claremont Rotary member donated the 6x3 m shipping container which now houses our bike club.  Claremont Rotary also helped with the transport of 14 used bicycles donated by Canadian Rotary branches to Peace and Love International. THANK YOU ROTARY! From the bike and shipping container donations a vision for a bike program at Fisantekraal High School was born! Conversations between BaB and PLI began and the two collaborated to develop a pedal-powered program to launch at the high school in 2014!

The Bike Club Programme



Over a course of 6-8 weeks, students attend regular workshop classes with a trained and enthusiastic instructor (read: bike geek) and fix a used bicycle. As they progress, the students develop a thorough understanding of basic mechanics, riding and safety skills and have the opportunity to participate in group rides and events. 
 
Once students have completed the programme, they graduate and become the proud owners of the bicycle they fixed themselves, a helmet, a lock and an invitation to continue participating in bike club as volunteer mechanics and teachers to their peer students. 

We've come a long way, but are passionately pedaling ahead!  


By the end of September, Bike Club will have graduated 10 students with bicycles from the programme and assisted 4 others in turning their pile of parts into something that moves them! We are rapidly evolving into a vibrant, diverse bicycle community and have students knocking on our door everyday, keen to get involved.  We want to take our bike club to the next level, expand and build our capacity to take on more students. We need more bikes, more parts, more gear and more of YOUR SUPPORT to make that happen! 


Open Shop - coming soon, with your help! 

Every week, the workshop is open to any student of Fisantekraal High School who wishes to repair their own bicycle or get involved in the space. Graduates of the program volunteer as mechanics and continue to be involved in bike club's group outings and Fisantekraal Bike Team events. 
 
We require that users of the workshop respect the shop space and contribute by way of assisting others, helping around the workshop or creating art or cool bicycle diagrams. Your donation can ensure we always have spare cables, tubes, brake pads and healthy snacks on site for our wrenching youth!

Fisantekraal Bike Team - coming soon, with your help!


Our latest dream is a team! We now have ten cycling enthusiasts with working bicycles and we are growing 'wheely' fast. We are ready to get involved in races and events and want to make it happen as a team. To do so, we need cycling jerseys and shorts for all team members as well as entrance fees and general participation costs (transportation, food accommodation) per event. To participate in mountain bike events, we will need approximately 12 mountain bikes for the team members to share.

The orphanage provides the students with a home to live in and with the help of Mercy Corps three meals a day. Throughout the school year 8 caretakers stay with the students in the orphanage.


Currently the orphanage houses a hospital room staffed with one doctor and two nurses. However, the infirmary room that they have is in complete disrepair; the toilet, sink and beds are all broken. This means no running water and no nearby toilet. As one of the most prominent sicknesses is diarrhea, this can cause a real problem trying to go outside and walk 400m to the squat toilet. The orphanage reached out to the Naryn Oblast Health Promotion Unit (HPU) to help find funding to repair their infirmary. The Naryn Oblast HPU is responsible for educating people about preventing the spread of communicable diseases and reducing the prevalence on noncommunicable diseases.

</h1>
<p></p>
<p>We're headed into our second week of crowd funding and we're 13% of the way there! Not bad! Many thanks to everyone involved! And for the rest of you... Don't you like wine?!? And shenanigans?! We got both here!</p>
<h1>What Are You Guys Doing? </h1>
<p></p>
<div>We're making wine! And people are buying it! Last year, we made 140 cases of Single-Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc, and managed to place it in restaurants and specialty shops all over California and New Mexico.</div>
<div>
<h1>Really?</h1>
<div>Yep! We did it the old-fashioned way, and drove all over the place, begging people to try our juice. It's kind of like touring in a rock band; you get to hang out in a van, see new places and meet people. It's really fun.</div>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451938605/bhb2ti7qytlak2t17bcm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<h1>So Why Are You Doing This?</h1>
<p>Because we like to drink wine and travel and meet people and find out about stuff! The three of us have spent our lives working in restaurants, and when we met and discovered we all wanted to make wine, we pooled our resources and made it happen! </p>
<p></p>
<h1>Just What Have You Gotten Yourselves Into?</h1>
<p>It's like this: Last time around, we emptied our bank accounts, called in some favors, and generally scraped together enough money to buy two tons of grapes, 4 steel barrels, and some bottles, caps and labels. We made Sauvignon Blanc and sold all of it, and used the money we made to buy four times as many grapes this year. Now that our wine has nearly finished working its magic inside the barrels, we need capital for the bottles, caps, labels, and to cover the fee at the facility where we're storing our wine. We're about 15 grand short, and our hair is turning gray AT THIS VERY MOMENT. </p>

<h1>Ok, What is the Goal Here? And Why ""Savage""?</h1>
<p>Our goal with Savage Wines is to produce minimally manipulated wines from all over California that serve as a snapshot of that particular time and place. We use organically cultivated fruit from a single vineyard, picked when we think the grapes are just right, crushed, fermented and bottled and delivered to your face. That's it. </p>
<p>We're shooting for an approachable, honest portrayal of climate and terroir. We started with the TTT vineyard Sauvignon Blanc from Happy Canyon in the east end of Santa Barbara's Santa Ynez Valley. This year, we're adding ANOTHER Sauvignon Blanc from the Jack Mcginley vineyard. No blending, no oak, no additives. Just the juice and a fun story.</p>
<p>We settled on the name ""Savage"" for a couple of reasons. The wild nature of the Sauvignon Blanc grape which, when left unchecked, grows and grows uncontrollably. It's a real show-off. We like that kind of enthusiasm. </p>
<p>We also took inspiration from history and Genghis Khan's nomadic Mongol Empire, who in the course of their admittedly brutal campaigns across the globe, would adopt and improve on the technological and agricultural innovations of the people who came under their rule. Using the best California has to offer, we hope to showcase wines from all over the state! (Without the, y'know, brutal violence)</p>

<h1>Why Sauvignon Blanc?</h1>
<p></p>
<div><div><div><p>We chose Sauvignon Blanc for several reasons. The first, and perhaps the most important, is that it’s what we most often drink personally. Second, just two hours from our office is a growing region (Santa Ynez Valley) whose Sauvignon Blanc has a reputation for producing premium wines. Third, making wine from this varietal is relatively simple; the grapes are crushed, barreled, and left to ferment. This wine will be ready for market just 7-8 months after harvest (Red wines, certainly the one’s we are interested in, will take more time). Finally, our first target market is Southern California, where it is always sunny and warm - a great environment for white wine sales.</p></div></div></div>

<h1>What We Need and How Your Contribution Helps!</h1> <p></p>
<p>We're launching this campaign in the hopes that our community will join us in delivering two unique wines representing what the Happy Canyon AVA has to offer. </p>
<p>With your support, we're aiming to raise $15,000.  We've personally invested our own savings, as have many of our family members. Savage is a bootstrap endeavor, in every sense. This campaign will help us launch our second vintage by securing the purchase of bottles, caps and labels and paying for the bottling of our wine (not to mention the renewal of state and federal licenses, which ain't cheap). Then, we can deliver it to more restaurants and retailers across the United States! Wouldn't that be neat?! </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The main risk is, of course, that no one buys the wine we make. (That would be bad.)</p>
<p>We are fortunate to have spent our entire working careers, 55 years cumulatively, learning about wine and developing lasting relationships in the food and wine community. In short, we feel that just as our first vintage was placed in restaurants in short order, our second vintage will be successful finding it's way to wine lists and retailer's shelves. With your help, Savage can ascend from regional curiosity to nationwide phenomenon!</p>

Help us out today! #LetsMakeWine



UPDATE!


We're headed into our second week of crowd funding and we're 13% of the way there! Not bad! Many thanks to everyone involved! And for the rest of you... Don't you like wine?!? And shenanigans?! We got both here!
What Are You Guys Doing? 

We're making wine! And people are buying it! Last year, we made 140 cases of Single-Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc, and managed to place it in restaurants and specialty shops all over California and New Mexico.

Really?
Yep! We did it the old-fashioned way, and drove all over the place, begging people to try our juice. It's kind of like touring in a rock band; you get to hang out in a van, see new places and meet people. It's really fun.



So Why Are You Doing This?
Because we like to drink wine and travel and meet people and find out about stuff! The three of us have spent our lives working in restaurants, and when we met and discovered we all wanted to make wine, we pooled our resources and made it happen! 

Just What Have You Gotten Yourselves Into?
It's like this: Last time around, we emptied our bank accounts, called in some favors, and generally scraped together enough money to buy two tons of grapes, 4 steel barrels, and some bottles, caps and labels. We made Sauvignon Blanc and sold all of it, and used the money we made to buy four times as many grapes this year. Now that our wine has nearly finished working its magic inside the barrels, we need capital for the bottles, caps, labels, and to cover the fee at the facility where we're storing our wine. We're about 15 grand short, and our hair is turning gray AT THIS VERY MOMENT.

</h1><p><br/></p><h3>""Share Zero Space is the new Social Netwotk of Things and Events"". <br/>
</h3><p><br/></p><p>How will be cool if you can control all wath you want in the real world?  <br/></p>Yes, imagine how cool it will be when you will be able to control any event you care for in the real world, from every place, by simply accessing a special cloud space and immediately interacting with that event!<br/><br/>This idea jumps over all limits if also you can share this superpowe with your family and with your friends.<br/><div>
<br/>All is now possible by using two things: a smart device and a social cloud website<br/><br/><h2>OK, but how does it works?<br/>
</h2>
<p>You only need to have at least one ShareZeroSpace device, here pictured without case and power supply for simplicity.<br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1388384/files/20150416081235-board_cor_shield_photo.jpg?1429197155"" src="""" style=""""/>       <i>(Photo of SZS core board connected + multi pourposes shield on bottom)</i><br/></p>
<br/>
<p>You need  to connect the device to the internet network (via cable or wifi)  and to the events you need to control. <br/></p>
<p>The controlled events may for example be related to <b>electrical motor driven gates, light or light systems, socket or socket stripes, irrigation systems, electrical locks, heating or cooling systems.</b> <br/></p>
<p>Or they may consist in events that you need to supervise, such as access to controlled doors, water level controls, power or water metering systems or whatever else is furnished of  an input or output dialogue. <br/></p>
<p>The example below shows the capabilities of core SZS board + multi purposes in/out/temp shield.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431103077/e9mzjyvlpxjouqdmpwzp.png"" src="""" style=""""/>This stage will require in most cases ten minutes of work by a non super-tech user, may be you or your electrician, or zero minutes by buying a ready to use device, such the power strip exhibit on demo.</p>
<br/>Then you need to register your new ShareZeroSpace device on the cloud, and, after a ultra simple localized language configuration, all is done.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430770389/twpqaw9nhh5uugbpejsy.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 597.67px;height: 448px;""/></p>
<br/>No specialized devices, no apps, no software, no servers, no long time learning curve. By means of any kind of internet connected device, such as mobile phones, tablets, PC’s, internet totems, etc., you can access your ShareZeroSpace zone using your personal account. <br/><br/>Immediately, you be able to operate on your controlled event through a simple and powerful graphic interface.<br/><br/>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430771251/mhcp8isu0dqjxpc390oi.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 593.726px;height: 262px;""/></p>You can have multiple ShareZeroSpace devices connected and joined to your account in multiple place all over the world. Awesome superpower!.<br/><br/>All is done. But there is more in SZS tech! We introduce <i><b>the opportunity</b></i>, with no complications, with no overwork, with no wast of time,<i><b> to share</b></i> every single controlled event <i><b>with others</b></i>.<br/><br/>The friendsor delegates will be authorized and alerted with a mail that includes the appropriate informations. From this point, your friends can interact with event, and  if you desire, you will be warned anytime. The cool side is that your shared-event friends, in their ZSZ zone on their accounts, can find and use the shared event. When you desire to stop the sharing, with a simple action you can cancel it. <br/><br/>Finally you can also be warned if something has changed status by e-mail, like a opened SZS controlled door or a electric motor failure when SZS will be adopted for check power overcharge.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430773207/l5syzi6h7eq3vj0u3hig.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 569.333px;height: 427px;""/></p>Also other people may have an account and multiple SZS device under their control, also they can share with you the control of events.<b> It's like a social network of things, instead of a social network of words. </b><br/><br/>You can do what you want no matter of community (share), no matter of time (zero), no matter of distance (space). <br/><br/><b><i>Simple, sure, instantly and primarily all, smart!.<br/></i></b><br/><i><b>If you help us</b></i> joining this campaign, <i><b>we help you</b></i> not only to enjoy of this smart solution, but <i><b>we together can really change</b></i> our way to enjoy life and <i><b>have more free time and fun!</b></i>.<br/><br/><i><b>Together we can make the difference from suffer the technology to steer technology!<br/><br/>More info on our prezi presentation about business opportunity <a href=""https://prezi.com/fqi-pnvzn-xl/share-zero-space-the-total-event-control-technology/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HERE</a>!</b></i><a name=""demo"" rel=""demo noopener nofollow""></a>

No problem, if you buy a micro-cloud server running SZS you can create your personal and even private SZS cloud. This mean you can put it in you private network and running it by controlling and sharing event like the world wide cloud on your private network. <br/>If you connect it to the internet (e.g. by your home adsl or wan) this will spread all over the world, and you can reach from any place, but remain your provate SZS cloud </p><p><b>Q</b>: After buy a SZS device, how I need to do for connect it to SZS cloud for control and share event connected to my SZS device</p><p><b>A:</b> What is needed is simply input the unicode serial string (proviced with yout SZS device) in the page ""Device"" after clicking add device. After this operation,you can assign descriptive names to your events and after configuring Ip address of yor network all is done. From now you'll find all event in your ""Zone"" page.  You can from now; control, share and delegate any event. SZS Cloud allow you can do everythings  from any device connected to the internet all over the world.<br/></p><p> <b>Q:</b> Why you think the product also without case?</p><p><b>A</b>: Because we consider the owner want to embed the SZS device in their appliance instead of place another case.

In the future we plan to have a case for inside with better design.<br/></p><p><b>Q:</b> How long takes to electrically connect SZS device to an event?</p><p><b>A:</b> Depend on event. In most case, like the electric gate, the irrigations system, the garden lights, etc. is a question of minutes. Consider that digital output o SZS device consist in a relay with open-common-close contact. It's like to connect a standard switch. </p><p><b>Q:</b> Can I use SZS device like a smart house bus component?</p><p><b>A:</b> Yes, the SZS device can work like a smart house bus component. Configuring it with function ""digital input act on related digital output""  and all is done. Locally you'll connect the wall switch to digital input and the related digital output (relay) will work like a switch. From this point you can locally switching the charge (eg.lamp) with your old wall switch and remotely you can use SZS cloud  in your account for control the switch event. The output can work like a two state switch (open/close) or if you want like a push button with desidered hold time (programmable). The power stripe output wokr like this. Remotely you can control related output socket and locally the same using the small red button (see socket stripe demo's photo). Feedback on SZS cloud is always the true state of input or output.  </p><p><b>Q:</b> What type of internet connection need SZS device<br/><br/><b>A:</b> SZS device work with all type of internet connection from super slow 33.6K, to a fast 100M fiber optic. Every type such fixed ADSL, WAN, HDSL work well and for mobile applications GPRS, 3G, 4G are suitable. <br/>Traffic from SZS clousd and SZS device use a very small bandwith and the footrprint of SZS on your network is very small.<br/></p><p><b>Q: </b>What about SZS device in mobile use</p><p><b>A: </b>SZS device work perfecty in mobile use. The device can work with a low power supply (9-12 VDC@ 0.6A max with all relay engaged) and is suitable to work with battery operated or with energy saving system such battery and solar pannel. Communication with internet can be realized using a GPRS, 3G or 4G connection. If SZS device is equipped with a WiFi expansion, it can operate also using smartphone or portable router. This means you can use for eg. for control door car opening or anti theft solution for cutting fuel simply stopping electric fuel car pump.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>
<p></p></div>","What do you want to control today?
""Share Zero Space is the new Social Netwotk of Things and Events"". 
How will be cool if you can control all wath you want in the real world?  Yes, imagine how cool it will be when you will be able to control any event you care for in the real world, from every place, by simply accessing a special cloud space and immediately interacting with that event!This idea jumps over all limits if also you can share this superpowe with your family and with your friends.
All is now possible by using two things: a smart device and a social cloud websiteOK, but how does it works?

You only need to have at least one ShareZeroSpace device, here pictured without case and power supply for simplicity.
       (Photo of SZS core board connected + multi pourposes shield on bottom)

You need  to connect the device to the internet network (via cable or wifi)  and to the events you need to control. 
The controlled events may for example be related to electrical motor driven gates, light or light systems, socket or socket stripes, irrigation systems, electrical locks, heating or cooling systems. 
Or they may consist in events that you need to supervise, such as access to controlled doors, water level controls, power or water metering systems or whatever else is furnished of  an input or output dialogue. 
The example below shows the capabilities of core SZS board + multi purposes in/out/temp shield.
This stage will require in most cases ten minutes of work by a non super-tech user, may be you or your electrician, or zero minutes by buying a ready to use device, such the power strip exhibit on demo.
Then you need to register your new ShareZeroSpace device on the cloud, and, after a ultra simple localized language configuration, all is done.
No specialized devices, no apps, no software, no servers, no long time learning curve. By means of any kind of internet connected device, such as mobile phones, tablets, PC’s, internet totems, etc., you can access your ShareZeroSpace zone using your personal account. Immediately, you be able to operate on your controlled event through a simple and powerful graphic interface.
You can have multiple ShareZeroSpace devices connected and joined to your account in multiple place all over the world. Awesome superpower!.All is done. But there is more in SZS tech! We introduce the opportunity, with no complications, with no overwork, with no wast of time, to share every single controlled event with others.The friendsor delegates will be authorized and alerted with a mail that includes the appropriate informations. From this point, your friends can interact with event, and  if you desire, you will be warned anytime. The cool side is that your shared-event friends, in their ZSZ zone on their accounts, can find and use the shared event. When you desire to stop the sharing, with a simple action you can cancel it. Finally you can also be warned if something has changed status by e-mail, like a opened SZS controlled door or a electric motor failure when SZS will be adopted for check power overcharge.Also other people may have an account and multiple SZS device under their control, also they can share with you the control of events. It's like a social network of things, instead of a social network of words. You can do what you want no matter of community (share), no matter of time (zero), no matter of distance (space). Simple, sure, instantly and primarily all, smart!.If you help us joining this campaign, we help you not only to enjoy of this smart solution, but we together can really change our way to enjoy life and have more free time and fun!.Together we can make the difference from suffer the technology to steer technology!More info on our prezi presentation about business opportunity HERE!
We make the cloud version running well,
and you can verify this by connecting to sharezerospace using the credential: e-mail: demo password: 12345. Once you logged in, then click on Zone and then click icon ""control"" on rigth side of lava lamp row. Please note, in this demo,  user account data is locked for avoiding undesidered user data changement.At this point you can locate the lamp status indicator and the command icon where, by clicking, you can control the switching of lamp. You also can use a web cam icon, by clicking it and, after you inserted the camera account (user:user, password:user), direct live video will appear on the screen, showing what happens to the lamp at the moment. You can find all the instructions about demo features and vision, in the document    ""Thechnology that we really need"" .

</h3></div>","Well,
mushroom science WILL save the earth soon 
And,
yup. We are amateurs in front of a camera. No apologies, but our WRITTEN REPORT is the hot topic, so please watch or read below and help us tell the world!
Our Story
Mission: 
We
are writing a report to share with the world to raise global awareness and help accelerate consumer
demand for this new, completely green technology. 
We
believe the greening and environmental recovery of our planet will be a reality
in our lifetime.  Households simply need
to know and ask for it. This campaign is a tool in the goal.Background:
Last
year, Fungi Magazine (http://www.fungimag.com/) requested an article about bio-composite technology that
uses mushroom plants (mycelia) to grow â€“ yes, GROW â€“ packaging shapes to cushion and protect items
in shipping.The
article for Fungi Magazine tentatively titled â€œEcovativeâ€™s Breakthrough Biomaterials: Materials for the
future, made with stuff that was here all alongâ€ is about creativity,
innovation, market driven, cost effective, competitive and environmentally
friendly technologies using components from the mushroom kingdom. Fungi
Magazine cannot afford to pay for this major piece, but the Editor agrees the
whole project should be shared.  We are
turning to crowd-funding so we may share this critically important story with
the world.Why is this so important? New science, new industry, more jobs, cradle-to-cradle material science, non-competing for food or feedstock, eliminating plastics for our oceans, non-toxic construction materials plus more!
Respectfully,

Penelope
Zeller

 The Impact
Our
article and this campaign intends to:
Â·                    
Illustrate that the expansion of bio-composite material science
will create jobs in new industries contributing to a new economy without
polluting. (This isn't like any other 'green' technology that currently exists! Using mushroom technology is the only cradle-to-cradle material science that can compete in cost effectiveness with EPS.)  
Â·                    
Create global consumer demand for technologies that replace
products with negative environmental impact. 
The more people know that these products are readily available now, the
faster business will respond to bring these to market
Â·                    
Expose powerful incentives to focus more resources to the study of
mycology.
Â·                    
Encourage enhancing our world by redirecting petroleum based
synthetic materials for long term use.
Â·                    
Create expectation of significant reduction in non-biodegradable
and hard to recycle plastics from the single-use waste stream.
Â·                    
Illustrate that there are ideas for other market driven
applications using the science and study of mycology to develop materials that
are not just green, but better â€“ economically and in terms of performance are
available now.

<p>We are just two guys that have found immense relief, by learning the hard way, that serving others is the ultimate fulfillment in this life. While this is something that we try to incorporate into our daily lives, the opportunity to serve some of the most impoverished and disenfranchised people in human history is uncommon but welcome. When a friend of Keith's made mention of the trip, he was (and is) willing to go volunteer out of pocket. When Keith made mention to Kevin, he was also willing to go volunteer out of pocket, but might be a little bit more selfless (and humble) because he quickly realized this could be an opportunity for many to contribute their hard-earned and well-deserved money to a worthy cause. Being familiar with self-organized fundraisers and the relatively recent phenomenon of crowdsourcing and social media utilization for this sort of thing, we figured it was worth a shot. So here's where you come in - donate whatever you want, or just post our link to your social media and spread the word otherwise however you want, but do it often! The goal of $5,000 was chosen pretty arbitrarily, with estimated costs for volunteers around $1,600 per person. We would love to raise enough money to make a nice cash donation, or maybe use the cash to buy something really useful for the kids (at the staff's suggestion). The deadline of September 12 was chosen because it is Andy Landers' birthday, and he is an amazing example of dedication and discipline in devotion to social justice.</p></div>","so stoked to receive the news that 30+ orphans have moved into a home with screens, safe running water, sewage and electricity as a result of the work we did. thank you all for your support and participation. please consider sharing our link and/or making a monetary contribution.
