<h3>Caitlyn, What are you doing??</h3>
<p><span>I am subletting my Oakland flat for four months and taking off on a bicycle with a pack of friends, a notebook, and a pencil. I have no idea what this journey will ""produce."" I will go and see what I shall see. I hope to find myself on unexpected adventures with new friends; I imagine that I will discover new ways of seeing the world and the people I share it with; I know that I will come back with notebooks full of writings, wacky tan lines, and crazy strong quads. </span></p>
<p><span>We will depart Oakland in mid-June and head east toward the foothills of the Sierras, then climb northward, landing in Ashland, Oregon, the first week of July. From there we'll continue north, make a right turn at Portland, Oregon, and head east across Idaho and into Montana. From there: Missoula (and the Adventure Cycling Association's Headquarters!) Glacier National Park, the Northern Plains and Great Lakes. Then northward to Canada to explore the Quetico Wilderness in southern Ontario and Quebec; then to Montreal...and finally...south, to end in Bar Harbor, Maine. Then the Amtrak back home! A more comprehensive list of cities we'll pass though can be viewed on my website: </span></p>

<h3>Why $5,000?</h3>
<p>First of all, I need a new bike!</p>
<p>I also need touring gear, maps, and provisions for four months on the road. </p>
<p>If I exceed my goal of $5,000, I will donate to Biketopia, a volunteer-run bicycle cooperative in South Berkeley, CA.</p>

What We Need & What You Get

Where the money goes:
For every $2 dollars donated, $1 dollar goes to one of three charities; the March of Dimes (who were very prominent in the NICU and absolutely amazing with their help to the families), Graham's Foundation, and Spare Key.  All three do great works and need to continue helping families who are on the same type of roller coaster ride we are on.  The other $1 will be used to help with expenses that have arisen for the care of our son.  We were comfortable financially before Cole’s birth, but now with the medical bills and the needs of a premature child, that comfortable is a thing of the past.  Due to Cole’s needs, my wife has had to quit her job in order to stay home to take care of him.

</p><p>Ever since I can remember,
Whalemina stood on the corner of beach 95<sup>th</sup> Street, overlooking the ocean
in Rockaway. Growing up, I would see the beautiful mosaic structure and admire
it. Images of the sun and moon adorned the Whale, and her smiling face seemed
to come to life. I thought she would be there forever. Unfortunately after
Hurricane Sandy devastated Rockaway Beach, Whalemina was washed away, pieces of
her body dispersed all throughout the streets of the peninsula. </p>
<p>My concern is this:
Whalemina’s memory will disappear; the kids of Rockaway will never even know
who she was. </p>

storm, along with so many things that were lost, I realized that Whalemina could
not be one of them. And so, I want to bring her back to life.</p><p>                                                                  * * * * *<br/></p><p>“Whalemina” is a fictional
piece, pulling from real events, telling the whole life story of the Rockaway
Whale. It begins with her journey from the sea, to the Central Park Children’s
Zoo where she was known as Jonah, all the way to her days in Rockaway. It's a story about adventure, wandering, growing up, getting lost, but eventually finding your way back home.</p>

<p>Printing and self-publishing
a book is not as simple as I thought. In order to print and publish 500
copies, it will cost over $2,000, and I would also like to be able to pay the artist for his hard work. And as much as I hate to ask people for
money, I have to admit I could use a little help from my friends. That being
said, absolutely anything helps! Whether it’s one dollar or one hundred
dollars, I would be super grateful that you care.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<br/><p>
</p>
<span style='font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: ""Verdana"",""sans-serif""; color: black;'>When my
Dad was diagnosed with and then died from liver cancer within a week I had no
intention of writing about it whatsoever. Then, I just woke up one morning,
went into auto-pilot and started typing. </span>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style='font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: ""Verdana"",""sans-serif""; color: black;'>The
result is <i style="""">‘Seven Days to Say I Love You.’</i>
</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><i style=""""><span style='font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: ""Verdana"",""sans-serif""; color: black;'>‘Seven Days to Say I Love You’</span></i><span style='font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: ""Verdana"",""sans-serif""; color: black;'> documents the week in which my
father died. It’s kind of a love story, and while it’s also an incredibly sad
story, I hope people find it, in parts, uplifting and inspirational. It deals
with things – death, loss, growing older – that most of us have to face at one time
or another, and I hope these are subjects that I have written about in a way
that people can relate to and understand. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style='font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: ""Verdana"",""sans-serif""; color: black;'>I have
self-published the book on Amazon Kindle where it has received some really great
reviews. This is the one I like best…</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style='font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: ""Verdana"",""sans-serif""; color: black;'> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-weight: bold;"">‘I took the decision to read Seven Days to Say I Love You'
for probably the wrong reasons - I have liked Ashley Hames for a while due to
his previous works, I thought he was a no nonsense, straight talking cool dude.
I figured anything that he had wrote and published would be to my liking. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-weight: bold;"">I decided one Saturday night that I would buy it. That night
I did not sleep. I was so compelled by the book that I could not put it down. Utter
brilliance, heartfelt and meaningful, I was truly inside the writer’s mind from
beginning to end. I'm not a crier, I never cry at films, books, or TV shows -
that is until now. To say I shed a few tears is a massive understatement: I
wept buckets. Each time I composed myself enough to continue reading I would
get through a couple of pages and start crying again. I gained a whole new
perspective of life. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-weight: bold;"">This book will make you cry, laugh, and experience emotions
that you may never knew existed. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Well done and thank you Ashley, I know that wherever Hamesy
is and whatever he is doing he is one proud father, and so he should be.’</span><span style='font-family: ""Courier New""; color: black;'></span></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I am using this site in the hope of funding a self-published 
paperback copy of my book and to launch an advertising campaign to get

</div></div>","Our Story


When my
Dad was diagnosed with and then died from liver cancer within a week I had no
intention of writing about it whatsoever. Then, I just woke up one morning,
went into auto-pilot and started typing. 
The
result is ‘Seven Days to Say I Love You.’

‘Seven Days to Say I Love You’ documents the week in which my
father died. It’s kind of a love story, and while it’s also an incredibly sad
story, I hope people find it, in parts, uplifting and inspirational. It deals
with things – death, loss, growing older – that most of us have to face at one time
or another, and I hope these are subjects that I have written about in a way
that people can relate to and understand. 
I have
self-published the book on Amazon Kindle where it has received some really great
reviews. This is the one I like best…
 
‘I took the decision to read Seven Days to Say I Love You'
for probably the wrong reasons - I have liked Ashley Hames for a while due to
his previous works, I thought he was a no nonsense, straight talking cool dude.
I figured anything that he had wrote and published would be to my liking. 
I decided one Saturday night that I would buy it. That night
I did not sleep. I was so compelled by the book that I could not put it down. Utter
brilliance, heartfelt and meaningful, I was truly inside the writer’s mind from
beginning to end. I'm not a crier, I never cry at films, books, or TV shows -
that is until now. To say I shed a few tears is a massive understatement: I
wept buckets. Each time I composed myself enough to continue reading I would
get through a couple of pages and start crying again. I gained a whole new
perspective of life. 
This book will make you cry, laugh, and experience emotions
that you may never knew existed. 
Well done and thank you Ashley, I know that wherever Hamesy
is and whatever he is doing he is one proud father, and so he should be.’


The Impact
I am using this site in the hope of funding a self-published 
paperback copy of my book and to launch an advertising campaign to get 
it noticed where people can see it and read it. Not everyone has a 
Kindle and not everyone likes reading off a computer.

My Story
“You cannot fine or guilt people into going green. All you create is a deeper aversion to governmental control over our personal lives. If the Green Movement really wants to get the average American onboard…pay him. Not with a new government program, but by educating people to the mutually beneficial opportunity in recycling.”  TS Penn, Introduction from “The Gaz Guide: No More Excuses, Getting paid to save the planet!”
 
I ran into friend who showed me a way to make enough money to get by and sometimes,… even better. I was already somewhat familiar with scrap metal recycling from back in the 1970’s. I grew up with a couple brothers whose family owned a Jersey junkyard… flash forward 25 years, now it is an Auto Salvage Facility. About 5-6 years ago, things took an unexpected turn.

You will be amazed by the money you are throwing out, or worse yet, PAYING the local recycling company to take away literally hundreds and probably thousands of dollars worth of scrap metal. They of course WILL NOT be big fans of this book.
 
            I have done quite a bit of writing over the years, from freelance articles, political blogs, business plans, press releases, marketing materials, website content, screenplays and more. I started writing the Gaz Guide about 2 years ago when the scrap metal market was crazy and I needed to find a source of income as the economy crashed. The lines outside metal recycling facilities were long… and today I see the same thing once again: elderly people in Cadillacs with garbage bags of aluminum cans and recyclables; mini-vans with soccer moms with kids in tow bringing in aluminum cans, old aluminum patio furniture, old mowers etc.; teenagers in pickup trucks filled with metal.  The word is out there but still so few know how to optimize their profits. 
 
            We are in bad economic times and the future does not look like it is going to get better anytime soon. I am now working to finish the first definitive book on everything you need to know about earning cash through scrap metal recycling. The book is a simple, humorous, and fun read.  Chock full of color photos and providing an eye-opening look at the cash that can be realized by recycling common items.  The book explains, step-by-step, how to make money by recycling.

The Impact
One can argue the semantics and morals behind the motivation to recycle for profit; however, in the end, it is a win-win situation. The Environmentalist and the Capitalist, the far left and far right, in this case, have finally found a common ground. I challenge you to find another scenario where these two opposing social and political worlds will agree. A mutually beneficial idea that actually benefits everyone whether your involved or not.
 
·         The more people who get involved… the cleaner the planet becomes.

            The concepts and information in this book will have an impact of the lives and income of the reader. Furthermore, it will have an impact on the planet and those of us who call earth home.

My End Goal
                       
 My goal is two parts.  The first part is to finish and self publish this book. Finding a publisher would be even better, but I want to get it out in the market as quickly as possible. The second part is to start a new company that will provide complete soup to nuts, recycling fund raising campaigns for charities and non-profit organizations such as the Adult work program for the disabled like the one my daughter is currently in.

We would work with major local corporations to encourage them, and their employees to donate recyclable materials for the charity or non-profit.
 
            I already have made contact with a school that also runs an “Adult Work Program” for the disabled as well as non-profit organization that assist our returning military veterans interested in arranging various outdoor activities and trips such as hunting and fishing, and camping. Both have expressed a sincere interest, excitement to get started as soon as I can get the company up and running. 
 
            This book is the first step. Charities and Non-Profit organizations have suffered from a major drop in donations due to the economy. I have a personal connection to the mentally disabled and military veterans. I see and hear on a daily basis about the needs I could help provide. I guess I could have added this to my section on “impact”. But the company will be phase II and will require quite a bit more funding than I am asking for the book.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><a href=""http://theculturalgutter.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Cultural Gutter</a> was created in the early years of the new millennium to fulfill a dream--provide quality, clear-eyed writing about disreputable art. Since 2004, we have written about videogames, comics, science fiction, fantasy, genre film, romance and television. And throughout that time, we have maintained a commitment to paying writers for their work.</p>
<p>In summer 2012, like many other arts organizations, we lost our Canada Arts Council operations grant. The legions of mazer tanks surrounded the vulnerable Cultural Gutter. But that fall, friends of the Cultural Gutter rallied to our Gutter-A-Go-Go campaign to help us keep our commitment to paying writers for their work. While we fell short of our goal, we raised enough money to make and send out all our contributor perks and keep The Gutter going until this June.</p>
<p>Now we hope to rise from the ashes as Gutter-A-Go-Go Raids Again!</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
The Cultural Gutter was created in the early years of the new millennium to fulfill a dream--provide quality, clear-eyed writing about disreputable art. Since 2004, we have written about videogames, comics, science fiction, fantasy, genre film, romance and television. And throughout that time, we have maintained a commitment to paying writers for their work.
In summer 2012, like many other arts organizations, we lost our Canada Arts Council operations grant. The legions of mazer tanks surrounded the vulnerable Cultural Gutter. But that fall, friends of the Cultural Gutter rallied to our Gutter-A-Go-Go campaign to help us keep our commitment to paying writers for their work. While we fell short of our goal, we raised enough money to make and send out all our contributor perks and keep The Gutter going until this June.
Now we hope to rise from the ashes as Gutter-A-Go-Go Raids Again!
 


What We Need
If you contribute to Gutter-A-Go-Go Raids Again, not only will you get the sweet perks that Gutter collaborators have donated, you will also support paying writers for their work and help loose upon the world thought-provoking essays on gutter culture.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>Raspberry Colored Scars</i>. This book is a collection of poems that works through a series of emotions and experiences surrounding sexual assault. It explores the idea of healing as a process that doesn’t end, but rather builds on itself over time. It also explores the cycle of love that we each experience.<br/><br/>My name is Elisabeth Foster and I am the author of Raspberry Colored Scars. I wrote this book because it is important to talk about healing and love. We are at a point in our culture where we are encouraging and learning from discussion about previously taboo issues, such as sexual assault and mental health.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will be able to connect to my feelings and emotions surrounding this topic. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of exploration of emotion and feeling that I have. I hope that you can feel with me in a way that is unique to your own experiences, as well as in relation to mine. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you be more aware and have a conversation with others who have had a traumatic experience.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you enjoy raw, honest emotion. It is blunt, vulgar, superfluous and empowering. Raspberry Colored Scars is a real book that speaks to both victims, their friends/family and perpetrators who are looking at assault through this lense for the first time.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Book - Raspberry Colored Scars</strong></h3>
<p>The book is broken into 6 sections...<br/><br/>I. Before: This section addresses the lack of understanding I had about sexual assault before I experienced it. It focuses on the difficulty associated with thinking back to a time before the assault happened.<br/><br/>II. Violation: Violation details the actual events of multiple assaults and the feelings that they create and leave behind. It outlines both a physical and emotional betrayal. <br/><br/>III. Healing I: This section considers the initial “healing” process that is often synonymous with suppression or denial. It is the facade that you put up for others, but also for yourself.<br/><br/>IV. Passion: Passion outlines the cycle of love - from meeting someone new, falling in love, losing someone you love to starting all over again. <br/><br/>V. Harm: Harm addresses the physical, emotional and mental harm that comes out of a traumatic experience such as assault. <br/><br/>VI. Healing II: This section acknowledges healing as a continual process. It encourages the reader to recognize their role in the creation of their own narrative.<br/> </p>
</div><div>

<h3>About the Author</h3>

She is an Archer Fellow and will be working for Representative Sheila Jackson Lee at her Washington, D.C., office in the Fall.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you.

I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.</p>

And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you be more aware and have a conversation with others who have had a traumatic experience.You will love this book if you enjoy raw, honest emotion. It is blunt, vulgar, superfluous and empowering. Raspberry Colored Scars is a real book that speaks to both victims, their friends/family and perpetrators who are looking at assault through this lense for the first time.
 
The Book - Raspberry Colored Scars
The book is broken into 6 sections...I. Before: This section addresses the lack of understanding I had about sexual assault before I experienced it. It focuses on the difficulty associated with thinking back to a time before the assault happened.II. Violation: Violation details the actual events of multiple assaults and the feelings that they create and leave behind. It outlines both a physical and emotional betrayal. III. Healing I: This section considers the initial “healing” process that is often synonymous with suppression or denial. It is the facade that you put up for others, but also for yourself.IV. Passion: Passion outlines the cycle of love - from meeting someone new, falling in love, losing someone you love to starting all over again. V. Harm: Harm addresses the physical, emotional and mental harm that comes out of a traumatic experience such as assault. VI. Healing II: This section acknowledges healing as a continual process. It encourages the reader to recognize their role in the creation of their own narrative.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><i>Trigger Warning</i> is a poetry book designed to show anyone out there who is going through a rough patch that there is always someone out there who understands and can help them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Harley Vaughn and I am the author of Trigger Warning. I wrote this book because I have battled depression and abuse in my past. I never had the courage to ask for the help I needed, so I am sharing my voice to push others to talk about what is going on in their lives and to seek recovery.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that though you feel alone or lost, there are others out there who have been through these battles as well. You will also find that it is possible to get help and get better. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for reaching out. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you find your voice and reach out to those around you for the help you need.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In this book, you'll learn about personal battles and seeking recovery:</p>
<ul>
<li>Love and Loss and how they can contribute in the downward spiral of our mental health</li>
<li>Depression, sexual and physical assault, along with other battles, and how it changes our outlooks on life</li>
<li>Finding the courage to say that you are not okay and how to go about recovering</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you have dealt, are dealing, or know someone who has had these issues in their life. Trigger Warning is a poetry book that speaks to teens and young adults who are looking at depression and recovery for the first time.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>The Book - <i>Trigger Warning</i>
</h2>
<p>The book is written in 4 Parts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Part 1 contains the introduction and Poems 1-5. In the introduction, I share how I personally battled through depression and suicidal tendencies, and how I sought recovery multiple times. These chapters will also show you love and how it can be the start of your mental downfall. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Part 2 contains Poems 6-15. These are based around heartbreak. The reader will learn how heartbreak and personal battles can go hand-in-hand as well as how relationships tend to fall apart when you are in a very bad mental state.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Part 3 contains Poems 16-51. This part of the book will look into personal battles such as depression, sexual and physical abuse, alcoholism, eating disorders, rape, and more. It will both educate readers on the dangers and struggles of these issues as well as show them that they are not alone in the things that they are going through or have gone through. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Part 4 contains Poems 52-70 and a hotline page. The last section of the book is constructed of tips on how to get through the recovery process, as well as including reminders and positive notes on how recovery is always possible, even after a relapse.  It is designed to really push them to seek help among their peers. The back of the book also has a page full of hotlines, in case someone needs help, but feels that they cannot reach out to those around them.</p>

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p>This is a book inspired by my mother’s immigration story. The book is also a self-reflection on my own life, and a lot of the character’s feelings and ideals are closely influenced by that.<br/><br/>My name is Dylan Luong and I am the author of Bring Your Heart. I wrote this book because I wanted to share these amazing real-life stories that have fascinated me all my life. I want readers to have a better understanding of the sacrifices and reasons that go into becoming an immigrant and how these same situations are still continually playing out in today’s world. On a personal note, I’ve also always wanted to write my own book as well as preserve my family’s story and legacy.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover a new perspective on immigration. Rarely do we ever get to hear these types of stories that take us into the perspective of an immigrant. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for storytelling in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you become even more aware and educated on the matter of immigration today.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the struggles of immigration and why immigrants choose to leave their home country:</p>
<ul>
<li>April 30th, 1975 - Fall of Saigon</li>
<li>Life on the Boat</li>
<li>Surviving on the Island</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you love an adventure. This story is very broad in terms of time, places, and experiences. A lot of the things that these characters go through may seem unimaginable — from living in a war-torn country for decades to being stranded on a boat in the middle of the ocean for two weeks while fending off pirates. It’s crazy to think that all of these things actually happened to real people. The journey from Vietnam to America is just the beginning, yet the events that lead up to this momentous feat are unbelievable.<br/><br/>Bring Your Heart is a fiction book that speaks to people from all different backgrounds who are curious about life as a Vietnamese immigrant or want to learn more about the infamous journey to get to America.<br/> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Book - Bring Your Heart</h2>The book is written in 4 Parts....<br/><br/>Part 1 is entitled “Vietnam.” The introduction is a look at the present time when Mei Le, the main character, is an adult living in rural Lancaster, Pa. She has a son who is curious about her upbringing, which transitions the story back in time to when the mom was a kid living in Vietnam during the war. In the following chapters, you will learn about her personality and the people that are closest to her. You get to see family dynamics and go deep inside her thought process. Following the Fall of Saigon, which signifies the end of the Vietnam War, there are time jumps that explain the reasoning for the family’s decision to leave Vietnam and their last few moments in their home country before leaving.<br/><br/>Part 2 is entitled “Boat People.” This is the second act of the story where the family leaves Vietnam in the pursuit of a new home. Things quickly turn south for the family on the boat; they experience food shortages, broken engines, and pirate attacks. All of these hardships are devastating blows to the family, and this section of the book truly depicts the gruesome reality that many immigrants unfortunately face. In the end they are saved, but not without much loss.<br/><br/>Part 3 is entitled “The Island.” After surviving the boat ride, the family now has to find a way to live on Kuku Island. Adjusting to this primal way of living is beyond normal for the family. Life and death suddenly become dependent on crucial decision-making. This section briefly touches on what life was like on the deserted island they lived on for approximately 2 years.<br/><br/>Part 4 is entitled “America.” This is the final act of the story. Throughout these different sections, we have seen the family live in and adapt to different environments. What makes this last part profoundly unlike any other is the fact that they are now the “black sheep.” Building up a new life is already in itself a challenge; add onto that having to learn the language and culture as well as having to interact with the people that already reside in this country. Minorities are always the odd man out, but this holds especially true in Lancaster, Pennsylvania (Amish Country). Vietnamese immigrants are also not regarded highly in America after the country’s controversial involvement in the Vietnam War. Now being fully grown and having lived in the United States for nearly all her life, Mei reflects on her journey to freedom. As a parent, Mei realizes that everything she’s been through was all for her son and that she should continue to share her stories with him to keep her family’s legacy alive.<h2> </h2>

introduction to the anthology, I suggest that origins of female erasure in Western
culture was propagated by the framing myth of Adam and Eve, and continues to affect
a majority of people on our planet, regardless of whether an individual
practices a religion based on this mythology. </p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">
<p>The cover image is intentionally complex and multi-layered in its
meanings. This classical image of Eve in the Garden of Eden is consistent with her
portrayals in Renaissance art as a white European female. Our understanding of
genetics today confirming human origins evolving out of Africa, the original
“Eve” would surely have been a dark skinned female. Clearly the image does not
represent all women in our glorious diversity of color and size. There is a
double meaning intended in the cover image as the “white” Eve in the
Renaissance portrayal has already been erased of her African origins, and
continues to disappear even as she reaches for the fruit from the Tree of
Knowledge.</p>
<p>In the Genesis 2 myth, a male God gives Adam, the first man, the power to
name all the creatures of the earth, including Eve, the first woman. Adam is
given the power by God to name her, and thus given power <i>over</i> the female sex, and given the power to <i>define</i> the very nature of woman. The male's empowerment by God to
name the female is intentional and significant. The woman does not name, and
thus define, herself. Her nature is literally man-made. The power of naming is
a magical act with cultural significance. The power to name ourselves has been historically
usurped from women, and over time we have forgotten that we ever had this power
to begin with. Female erasure continues to be propagated through gender
identity politics today and continuing efforts to define and enforce oppressive
gender constructs on the female sex.</p>
<p>The cover
for this anthology was created as a gift from my oldest and dearest friend,
renown photographic artist Claudia Kunin. </p>

<p><b>WHAT'S IN THE BOOK?</b></p>
<p>Through researched articles, essays, first-hand experiences, story telling, and verse, these voices are needed to ignite the national conversation about the politics of gender-identity as a backlash to feminist goals of liberation from gender stereotypes, oppression and sexual violence.<br/></p>

<p>This anthology encourages readers to consider how and why our female bodies matter, and how our bodies inform our everyday lives. Contributors shed light on how the language of gender-identity politics has been purposely used to reframe and replace specifically biology-based realities, reinforcing the destructive hierarchy that objectifies and harms women and children. </p>
<p>Some contributors connect the momentum of female erasure to the ways we treat our Mother Earth. Others share their personal struggles with being gender nonconforming women, with some sharing their journeys from living as trans men and their choice to de-transition. Some discuss political struggles and triumphs arising from providing female-centered spiritual spaces, reclaiming their female bodies as a source of power and significance, and why it is so important for all of us to consider asking deeper questions about how misogyny, violence, and sexism are being enacted in this issue. </p>
<p>Contributors come from a wide variety of backgrounds in terms of race, class, religion, sexual orientation, and age (ranging from twenty to eighty-three years old), and live in the United States, Zimbabwe, Australia, and the United Kingdom.  They are lesbian feminists, political and spiritual feminists, heterosexual-womanist women,mothers, scholars, attorneys, poets, medical and mental health providers, environmentalists, and women who chose to de-transition, all providing perspectives that are ignored, silenced, vilified, or underrepresented in the popular media and disregarded in discussions promoting legal protections for transgender persons at the expense of women and girls. Some contributors wrote under pseudonyms to keep their teaching jobs or to protect their children from harassment. </p>

Ruth Barrett, Anthology Editor and Project Weaver


ABOUT THE BOOK


This book bears witness and exposes the current trend of gender identity politics as a continuation of female erasure as old as patriarchy itself.  
This anthology brings together voices of forty-six contributors celebrating female embodiment while exploring deeper issues of misogyny, violence and sexism in gender identity politics today, demonstrating the intentional silencing and erasure of living female realities.These perspectives come at a time when gender politics and profits from an emerging medical transgenderism industry for children, teens, and adults inhibits our ability to have meaningful discussions about sex, gender, changing laws that have provided sex-based protections for women and girls, and the re-framing of language that erases females as a distinct biological class.ABOUT THE COVERIn my
introduction to the anthology, I suggest that origins of female erasure in Western
culture was propagated by the framing myth of Adam and Eve, and continues to affect
a majority of people on our planet, regardless of whether an individual
practices a religion based on this mythology. 
The cover image is intentionally complex and multi-layered in its
meanings. This classical image of Eve in the Garden of Eden is consistent with her
portrayals in Renaissance art as a white European female. Our understanding of
genetics today confirming human origins evolving out of Africa, the original
“Eve” would surely have been a dark skinned female. Clearly the image does not
represent all women in our glorious diversity of color and size. There is a
double meaning intended in the cover image as the “white” Eve in the
Renaissance portrayal has already been erased of her African origins, and
continues to disappear even as she reaches for the fruit from the Tree of
Knowledge.
In the Genesis 2 myth, a male God gives Adam, the first man, the power to
name all the creatures of the earth, including Eve, the first woman. Adam is
given the power by God to name her, and thus given power over the female sex, and given the power to define the very nature of woman. The male's empowerment by God to
name the female is intentional and significant. The woman does not name, and
thus define, herself. Her nature is literally man-made. The power of naming is
a magical act with cultural significance. The power to name ourselves has been historically
usurped from women, and over time we have forgotten that we ever had this power
to begin with. Female erasure continues to be propagated through gender
identity politics today and continuing efforts to define and enforce oppressive
gender constructs on the female sex.
The cover
for this anthology was created as a gift from my oldest and dearest friend,
renown photographic artist Claudia Kunin. 

WHAT'S IN THE BOOK?
Through researched articles, essays, first-hand experiences, story telling, and verse, these voices are needed to ignite the national conversation about the politics of gender-identity as a backlash to feminist goals of liberation from gender stereotypes, oppression and sexual violence.
This book is broken down into different topical sections including: 
Biological Erasure by Gender Ideology, Re-Framing Reality and the Language of Erasure, The ""Violent"" Female Body, A Room of Our Own, Personal Stories from the Belly of the Beast, and Resistance to Delusion.

<p>Three months ago, I was sitting in a coffee shop in Elgin with my friend Ransom, discussing the vision God has laid on my heart for the next season of life and ministry. This conversation was especially significant, because my relationship with Ransom started 5 years ago when he was still a sophomore in high school struggling with depression and addiction. He was the victim of abuse growing up, and had particular difficulty in social and emotional situations.</p>
<p>Several years ago when we began thinking about how to help hurting students in our community, the ideas in Luke 4:18-19 were close to our heart. This is the passage where Jesus describes his mission. He states that he came to <strong>“proclaim good news to the poor,” “to set the oppressed free,” and “to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.”</strong> Matthew 4:23 goes on to describe Jesus’ ministry as “preaching,” “teaching,” and “healing.” He focused on people’s minds, hearts, bodies, and relationships in his ministry, and we wanted to do the same. After seeing a need to address addiction, loss, grief, anxiety, self-harm and other forms of pain (and after much trial and error), Christ Community Church empowered me to launched a program called Regroup.</p>
<p>5 years later, sitting in front of me in the coffee shop, Ransom was now a mature young man, paying his own bills, healthily coping with depression and his past trauma. The difference is stark and the change that took place in his life was not by accident. He spent 2 years using the Regroup tools. He took responsibility for hurt he had caused, learned his identity in Jesus, and he learned how to forgive the people who had hurt him. <strong>He was set free, and he wasn’t the only one. </strong>6 students came to our first meeting, but within two sessions, that number had grown to 36 each week. Over the course of 5 years, we ran a new session every 4 months, and even took the program to ministry partners in the Czech Republic. We saw hundreds of students impacted, and whole families transformed.</p>
<p><strong>Now, we’re ready to take Regroup further. </strong>We want to empower pastors and leaders across the country to help people find strength together in community, and we need your help. This Christmas, we’re looking to raise $5500 to print 500 books and 50 leader resource guides in order to equip leaders to raise up small groups, train mentors, and encourage hurting people that hope is possible.</p>

</h3><p><b>Birth of a Book</b></p>
<p>Back in the early 90’s, a

sports, so I took up golf.<span>  Working on my
game whenever possible, I managed to lower my handicap from 20 to 2, and in

thriller.  I had a stack of instruction
books laying around, all chock full of ideas, but none were fun to read.  Most of them read like textbooks with an
overwhelming amount of information.  My
idea was to offer a series of short, concise lessons through on-the-course
interaction between entertaining characters, while at the same time building an
exciting murder mystery—a fun read with mental game ideas that a golfer could
take right to the golf course.  Those
ideas became my “easy golf” strategy.  Virtually

<h3>The Plot</h3><p>From the back cover
</p><p>In the resort
town of Bend, Oregon,
Andy Harris is mired in a brutal slump. For over
a month he’s been grinding away, studying his golf books and magazines, playing
and practicing more, but nothing seems to help. Fueling his panic is the
upcoming club championship, when he has to square off against a questionable
friend who employs an array of gamesmanship to disrupt him when they play. If
he can’t fix his game by then, he’s not sure what he’ll do. Maybe swap his
clubs for a bowling ball.</p>
<p>Four hundred miles away, Reno Homicide Detective
Warren Sutter isn’t doing so well himself. First, there was the phone call from
a good friend, whose son has disappeared. Then there’s his new partner, Robert
Tensley, a naive rookie detective who has just transferred from public relations.
Against his fervent objections, Warren is ordered to mold Robert into a competent detective
as they pursue the missing person case. </p>

nameless stranger begins tailing the casino owner, confirming the father’s
threat.</span></p>

Leicht zu lesende medizinische Spitzen-Informationen im Abonnement täglich per e-mail! Kurz und knackig.
Hintergrund/ Erfahrung:

bloggen wir (auch auf Facebook und Twitter) seit 3 Monaten schon 3-4 Mal in der Woche sauber und kurz aufgearbeitet neueste Top News aus der Welt der Medizin und angrenzender Gebiete.

Das eingesetzte Geld soll die kompletten Kosten des Projekts für mindestens ein Jahr decken. Parallel wird mit den Informationen eine abrufbare, einfache Datenbank des medizinischen Wissens erstellt.
Ich persönlich muss dabei nichts daran verdienen.
Die News sind einzigartig vom Inhalt, da ich direkten Zugang zu allen wichtigen Datenbanken, Verlagen und Portalen habe. Tagfrische News, kurz und knackig aufgearbeitet und für jeden Laien sofort verständlich, das macht keiner im Moment.

Mit der Unterstützung der Kampagne erreichen wir gemeinsam, dass alle Menschen endlich in die Situation kommen, an Spitzen-Informationen und Wissen zu kommen, die sie selbst in Ihrem Leben unabhängiger, selbstständiger macht. Wichtiges Wissen, was auch in unseren Datenbanken aufgebaut wird.
Schon vor und/oder nach jedem Gang zum Arzt  kann der Abonnent eine Diagnose kontrollieren, entsprechende Fragen stellen und sich sicher sein, das das Richtige gemacht wird.

<p></p>
<p style=""font-family: Arial;font-size: 17.3333px;line-height: 1.38;white-space: pre-wrap;"">El PERÚ es un país de múltiples identidades, un abanico de sabores, colores, ritmos y tradiciones que en suma nos hacen un país de “todas las sangres”. Como país contamos con una diversidad en recursos culturales e históricos que asombran y educan, así como recursos ambientales que riqueza y belleza; en este marco único se viene realizando en el Perú el Festival Internacional de Narración Oral del Perú: TODAS LAS PALABRAS, TODAS!!!</p>
<p style=""font-family: Arial;font-size: 17.3333px;line-height: 1.38;white-space: pre-wrap;"">Buscamos ser un proyecto artístico socio-cultural que sea un ejemplo de: real descentralización e inclusión social para unir, compartir, integrar, sumar y hacer de nuestras diferencias un vínculo; de nuestros idiomas puentes y de nuestros recursos, oportunidades sustentables.</p>
<p style=""font-family: Arial;font-size: 17.3333px;line-height: 1.38;white-space: pre-wrap;"">Queremos promover la lectura, la identidad cultural, la diversidad, la integración, la valorización y cuidado de la memoria de los pueblos. De esta forma se trabaja el respeto a las diferencias, el enfoque de género, la educación y el desarrollo económico sostenible.</p>

<p></p>
<p style=""font-family: Arial;font-size: 17.3333px;line-height: 1.38;white-space: pre-wrap;"">Uno de nuestros objetivos es que el festival se co-gestione involucrando a diversos actores sociales donde el festival vaya teniendo presencia y así contribuir a reales procesos de descentralización e inclusión social.</p><p style=""font-family: Arial;font-size: 17.3333px;line-height: 1.38;white-space: pre-wrap;"">Ya se ha logrado y se ha demostrado que este tipo de co-gestión es posible, donde diversos tipos de entidades (entidades gubernamentales, empresas, organismos de la sociedad civil), asumen responsabilidades, desarrollan capacidades de gestión cultural y de toma de decisión conjunta).Consideramos necesario que el festival contribuya a democratizar el acceso a las expresiones culturales. Dentro de cada región se ha logrado estar presente en diversos espacios para brindar a la población más opciones de acceso al festival. De esta forma se hacen presentaciones en teatros, universidades, escuelas y también en asentamientos humanos, albergues, cooperativas, cárceles (centros penitenciarios), etc. </p><p style=""font-family: Arial;font-size: 17.3333px;line-height: 1.38;white-space: pre-wrap;""><span style=""font-family: Arial;font-size: 17.3333px;line-height: 1.38;background-color: initial;"">Las actividades son programadas y difundidas por igual, así ninguna población es tratada como “objeto de una acción de ayuda social”, sino como parte de una programación integral. Se busca alcanzar los mismos criterios de calidad y visibilidad.</span></p>
<p style=""font-family: Arial;font-size: 17.3333px;line-height: 1.38;white-space: pre-wrap;"">El festival desarrollará una estrategia de desarrollo económico sostenible a partir de involucrar activamente a gobiernos regionales, empresas, operadores turísticos, artistas, organismos de la sociedad civil y asociaciones culturales.Se comparten actividades y se logra descentralizar realmente el evento, fomentando que los representantes regionales se apropien del mismo y vean a este no como una “extensión” o una “versión” de un festival desde Lima (la capital), sino que incluso vean las oportunidades que su realización implica.</p>
<p style=""font-family: Arial;font-size: 17.3333px;line-height: 1.38;white-space: pre-wrap;""><span>El festival sensibiliza en el cuidado y promoción de los recursos culturales y ambientales así como la mejor convivencia y el enfoque de género, a su vez genera oportunidades de intercambio, capacitación, desarrollo y crecimiento a los “jóvenes narradores orales” tanto a nivel nacional como internacional.</span><br/></p><p style=""font-family: Arial;font-size: 17.3333px;line-height: 1.38;white-space: pre-wrap;""><span></span></p><p></p>

</div></div>","¿Qué es el Festival Todas las palabras, Todas!?
Todas las palabras, Todas! es un festival internacional de narración oral en el Perú, el cual tiene vida todos los años en el mes de Setiembre desde el 2011, año de su primera edición. 
Desde su primera edición, cada año, se ha realizado simultáneamente en más de 5 regiones congregando a artistas nacionales e internacionales: narradores, voces nuevas de la oralidad, cantautores e invitados especiales. Ellos tejen una red de presentaciones, talleres, encuentros y más en ciudades, comunidades, teatros, centros culturales, universidades escuelas, centros penitenciarios, etc. 
Este es un proyecto de desarrollo cultural con un enfoque de descentralización e inclusión social que busca desarrollarse en cada región, a través de socios co-gestores que nos permitan tener una presencia permanente
El festival es una fiesta de la palabra que busca tejerse cada año de manera comunitaria, creciendo, y llegando poco a poco a más regiones que se unan al sueño de poder contar con un festival que se haga realmente en todo el Perú como un manto tejido a mano que abrigue a todos por igual.

¿Por qué organizamos el festival Todas las palabras, Todas!?

El PERÚ es un país de múltiples identidades, un abanico de sabores, colores, ritmos y tradiciones que en suma nos hacen un país de “todas las sangres”. Como país contamos con una diversidad en recursos culturales e históricos que asombran y educan, así como recursos ambientales que riqueza y belleza; en este marco único se viene realizando en el Perú el Festival Internacional de Narración Oral del Perú: TODAS LAS PALABRAS, TODAS!!!
Buscamos ser un proyecto artístico socio-cultural que sea un ejemplo de: real descentralización e inclusión social para unir, compartir, integrar, sumar y hacer de nuestras diferencias un vínculo; de nuestros idiomas puentes y de nuestros recursos, oportunidades sustentables.
Queremos promover la lectura, la identidad cultural, la diversidad, la integración, la valorización y cuidado de la memoria de los pueblos. De esta forma se trabaja el respeto a las diferencias, el enfoque de género, la educación y el desarrollo económico sostenible.

¿Cómo funciona el festival Todas las palabras, todas!?

Uno de nuestros objetivos es que el festival se co-gestione involucrando a diversos actores sociales donde el festival vaya teniendo presencia y así contribuir a reales procesos de descentralización e inclusión social.Ya se ha logrado y se ha demostrado que este tipo de co-gestión es posible, donde diversos tipos de entidades (entidades gubernamentales, empresas, organismos de la sociedad civil), asumen responsabilidades, desarrollan capacidades de gestión cultural y de toma de decisión conjunta).Consideramos necesario que el festival contribuya a democratizar el acceso a las expresiones culturales. Dentro de cada región se ha logrado estar presente en diversos espacios para brindar a la población más opciones de acceso al festival. De esta forma se hacen presentaciones en teatros, universidades, escuelas y también en asentamientos humanos, albergues, cooperativas, cárceles (centros penitenciarios), etc. Las actividades son programadas y difundidas por igual, así ninguna población es tratada como “objeto de una acción de ayuda social”, sino como parte de una programación integral. Se busca alcanzar los mismos criterios de calidad y visibilidad.
El festival desarrollará una estrategia de desarrollo económico sostenible a partir de involucrar activamente a gobiernos regionales, empresas, operadores turísticos, artistas, organismos de la sociedad civil y asociaciones culturales.Se comparten actividades y se logra descentralizar realmente el evento, fomentando que los representantes regionales se apropien del mismo y vean a este no como una “extensión” o una “versión” de un festival desde Lima (la capital), sino que incluso vean las oportunidades que su realización implica.
El festival sensibiliza en el cuidado y promoción de los recursos culturales y ambientales así como la mejor convivencia y el enfoque de género, a su vez genera oportunidades de intercambio, capacitación, desarrollo y crecimiento a los “jóvenes narradores orales” tanto a nivel nacional como internacional.

¿Como te vamos a agradecer?
Hay muchas maneras de agradecer por formar parte de Todas las palabras, Todas!
Queremos hacerte parte del proceso, enviarte actualizaciones que muestre cómo vamos avanzando con el desarrollo del festival, antes del estreno y durante el transcurso de este.
También queremos reconocer tu apoyo en nuestra comunidad en redes sociales y como colaborador en nuestra publicidad impresa.
Para aquellos que quieren recibir una muestra de nuestro agradecimiento y profundizar en el proceso del festival tenemos: 


Un susurrador, hecho a mano por pobladores de algunas regiones en donde se realiza el festival. Un susurrador es un tubo de material reciclable que sirven para transmitir poesías o coplas que se recitan al oído, son los  elementos necesarios para transportarse a lugares soñados, sin moverse del lugar. Esta muestra de agradecimientos es válida solo para 5 colaboradores.         


Una clase maestra de introducción a la narración  (presencial u online) con un narrador de cuentos profesional. La clase tiene un número límite de 8 alumnos.
Visibilización de tu apoyo en nuestros canales de comunicación. (En caso de solicitarlo)
Por último esperamos que la principal forma de recompensa sea la de hacerse parte de un festival que busca seguir creciendo y expandirse en todas las regiones del Perú.

¿Quiénes somos?

Within hours of iScot announcing their presence, a number of ‘anonymous’ twitter users attempted to put sustained pressure on Intu Braehead's management and London HQ to ban the sale of iScot.  Several of Intu's tenants including M&amp;S were targetted also.  <div>
<br/><div>These individuals began by tweeting and retweeting false and malicious allegations that iScot was a “political protest group”. They inferred the magazine preached hate messages and was connected to organisations involved in violent, racist and illegal activities.  <p></p>

<h3>What's this all about? </h3>
<p>I am Avery Lockland, and I am the author of a new dystopian novel called Hue &amp; Cry. This book is about Alison Mason, a resident of the town of Tormid, which sits in the eye of a perpetual storm that covers all of the known world. Outside of Tormid's walls there is nothing but death. Inside the walls they are protected by the good will of the Storm King. Every 13 years, the residents of Tormid burn a holy child alive, and Alison's newborn baby is selected to be the next sacrifice. <br/><br/>I wrote this book because that's what I do. I tell stories that I believe people will be able to connect with. Alison's struggles with motherhood, post-partum depression, abuse, and oppression might feel very real for a lot of women reading this. <br/><br/>I hope this story can inspire people to think about the issues she goes through, both on a cultural and personal level. Perhaps if you can see yourself in Alison, her fears and loneliness might resonate with you.</p>
<h3>Welcome to Tormid </h3>
<p>Across the 13 chapters of Hue &amp; Cry, you will become familiar with Tormid and it's culture. The city's main landmark is the Cathedral of the Storm King, which sits at the heart of everything. There, the clergy (lead by the Archbishop) rules over the population. Caster Lynch, one of the wealthier members of the city, covets that position, and has made it his personal aspiration to rise through the church's ranks. And several blocks east of the Cathedral sits the Militia fort, a stone base built into the city's tall wall, featuring the only gate through to the wastelands outside. Jacob Flint, Alison's childhood friend, is a part of this Militia, and their mission is to map and explore the inhospitable lands scarred by the storm, in search of artifacts belonging to the Old-World.    <br/> </p>
</div><div>

NEW BOOK OUT 13TH OF DECEMBER 2010 ;D</span><br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/></p>
<p>Dear wonderful person deliberating whether or not to spend time reading this pitch,</p>
<p>It's nice to see you! My name is Katy Gilbert, and I'm an author who isn't anywhere rich enough to do this without your help.</p>
<p>I would desperately like to produce a new book. This <span class=""caps"">DIY</span> project is the written equivalent of a musician's EP; a collection of pieces that I think you'll enjoy, all put together. It's made up mostly of prose and a couple of poems; a couple of old favourites and many more exclusive pieces that you won't find anywhere else! Happy, sad, angry and glad; the spectrums of feeling, encouragement and linguistic techniques are packed in there!</p>
<p>Now, without resorting to hyperbole, this book is hopefully going to be the <em>best thing you've ever read</em> and so you might want to change your life by donating a little bit of money to help me make it happen.</p>
<p>Here's the thing: I can self-publish this little side-project for nothing, but <em>torturously</em> I can't print or ship it to you, or me in order to ship it to you (keeping the reader's cost down) without money. And I have a bit. Which I will use because this means more to me than anything, apart from you obviously. However, it's not quite enough.</p>
<p>Which is where wonderful you comes in! To the right you can see a list of perks ï¿½ call them emblems of my undying gratitude to you ï¿½ that you will receive according to the amount that you donate. And they're fun and lovely and great!</p>
<p>If you're interested in the perks that involve choosing a piece from the book, here are your options:<br/> 1.ï¿½Happily single? You, apparently, are a liar.ï¿½ (working title)<br/> 2.ï¿½How Sun Rises Deceitful Promiseï¿½ï¿½<br/> 3.ï¿½This Sicknessï¿½ (working title)<br/> It's up to you!</p>
<p>Honestly, though, I wouldn't enjoy my work so much without the emotional support that followers, friends and family like you have shown me, so this seems like an appropriately creepy opportunity to thank you for that.</p>
<p>Let's make this happen!</p>
<p>Thank you for taking a look,</p>

Dear wonderful person deliberating whether or not to spend time reading this pitch,
It's nice to see you! My name is Katy Gilbert, and I'm an author who isn't anywhere rich enough to do this without your help.
I would desperately like to produce a new book. This DIY project is the written equivalent of a musician's EP; a collection of pieces that I think you'll enjoy, all put together. It's made up mostly of prose and a couple of poems; a couple of old favourites and many more exclusive pieces that you won't find anywhere else! Happy, sad, angry and glad; the spectrums of feeling, encouragement and linguistic techniques are packed in there!
Now, without resorting to hyperbole, this book is hopefully going to be the best thing you've ever read and so you might want to change your life by donating a little bit of money to help me make it happen.
Here's the thing: I can self-publish this little side-project for nothing, but torturously I can't print or ship it to you, or me in order to ship it to you (keeping the reader's cost down) without money. And I have a bit. Which I will use because this means more to me than anything, apart from you obviously. However, it's not quite enough.
Which is where wonderful you comes in! To the right you can see a list of perks ï¿½ call them emblems of my undying gratitude to you ï¿½ that you will receive according to the amount that you donate. And they're fun and lovely and great!
If you're interested in the perks that involve choosing a piece from the book, here are your options: 1.ï¿½Happily single? You, apparently, are a liar.ï¿½ (working title) 2.ï¿½How Sun Rises Deceitful Promiseï¿½ï¿½ 3.ï¿½This Sicknessï¿½ (working title) It's up to you!
Honestly, though, I wouldn't enjoy my work so much without the emotional support that followers, friends and family like you have shown me, so this seems like an appropriately creepy opportunity to thank you for that.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>A little over two years ago, I built a website and launched a facebook page for my book series, ""Happiness in Your Life."" I had planned on taking my 12 years of journals and notebooks and organizing them into 12 books, releasing them over time. I started writing and designing inspirational posters, and then a blog, and then another blog...and now I have written and posted over 900 posters and close to 500 articles on several blogs, the facebook page, and a newsletter. I would not have believed it had I not lived it. I am humbled and grateful daily to the 300,000+ friends on the facebook page who inspire me, motivate me, and who I look forward to seeing every day. </p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Printing full color books is not really possible in small quantities. Well, it is, but they'd cost around $100 each. I'd like to have my book, ""Poems"" made, quantity 2500 (or more). It will be a full color 6""x6"" book of approximately 50 poems. They are all poems I have written over the past two years. Some are about love, or about moving on, forgiving, and of course...dreams. </p>
<p>In addition to printing costs, I will need to purchase more image licenses, UPC code, ISBN Number, and shipping envelopes and postage to mail them out. </p>
<p>-If the goal is exceeded, I really would love to redo <a href=""http://www.happinessinyourlife.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.happinessinyourlife.com</a> and add more free pdf posters, reorganize the whole site to show all the blogs, and make it look pretty. </p>
<p>-I also have monthly expenses of image licenses (which supports independent photographers and artists), domain names, software, bandwidth, the newsletter service, and disc space. I never wanted to do a paid subscription site, as I wanted the articles to be free for anyone who needs them to read. Unfortunately, that means I get the whole bill every month. Fortunately, I've been able to do quite a lot. When I have more, I can do more. I would love that.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In my own life, I have discovered a lot. I used to feel powerless, angry, sad, all sorts of self-defeating ideas and limitations that it seemed were ""just reality."" Then one day, I found myself in a hospital bed with meningitis and a ""right to die"" contract in front of me provided to me by the nurse which stated that if I get to the point where machines are the only thing keeping me alive, to unplug them.</p>
<p>I realized then that this could really be ""it,"" ""over and out.""</p>
<p>I said a prayer that day that if I were given another shot, I promise to figure myself out and then share anything and everything with anyone and everyone. I promised to appreciate life and believe in all good things. An amazing recovery followed, and 15-odd years later, here we are.</p>
<p>I know that most of my unhappiness was really just faulty thinking. I know that happiness is possible for just about everyone, and I do my best to share everything I've learned since then with you. </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>     My newest book, ""Turds"", just got published recently.  Now it's time for me to promote the mofo!  I've used all the free advertising avenues I could think of.  Being a former business owner, I know that sometimes paid advertising works the best.  Here's the lowdown on the book:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>     From the author of ""Teenage Vigilante"", comes the new ebook, ""Turds"".   
The plot deals with a military experiment involving fecal matter gone 
awry.   When four giant poop monsters are unleashed upon an unsuspecting 
small town, only one man can save the day.   Ernie Sputnik!   He's the 
goofball plumber who knows the sewers like the back of his hand.<br/><br/>     The
 book reads like a parody of the film, THE BLOB(1988).   This extremely 
hilarious romp plays as a tribute to horror films in general, with 
tongue-in-cheek references to TOXIC AVENGER, TREMORS, and SAW.<br/><br/>     As
 Ernie teams up with his pal Scotty, they must battle the turd creatures
 with machine guns, grenades, and even Lysol!   If you enjoy bathroom 
humor or giant monster movies, you'll love this.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>     It's available for the Kindle, PC, Palm, Android, iphone, ipod touch, Nook, Sony Reader, etc.  Turds can be found on Amazon and Smashwords.<br/><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>     The goal is to get the word on ""Turds"" out there.  If this book sells well, I'll be publishing another this summer.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>     So my plan is to raise at least $500 for things such as:<br/><br/>* Facebook advertising<br/><br/>* Printing up business cards to circulate<br/><br/>* Buying ad space on a few blogs</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>* Place an ad in Fangoria magazine</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>     I'm even sacrificing some of my personal items to make this happen! <br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>     The best way you can help is spreading the turd.....er, the word!  Post the link to this page on Facebook, Twitter, Myspace, Craigslist, Yahoo groups, on your email lists, on your blog, etc.<br/></p>

<p><span>Elle has been watching Jacob for 14 years, from the moment of their births, until they both reached their teens. Jacob has no idea that he has been targeted, chosen, by Elle's parents. The day has arrived for her to finally begin her part of her parents' mission: to seduce Jacob so he'll accompany her back to her parents' home planet.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>About the Author:</span></p>
<p><span>The passing of my wife two years ago gave me the impetus to reinvent myself so I could stay home with my kids. I decided to pursue a passion, writing.  My children, now 13 and 15 years old, inspired me to write in a genre they love to read.  Socialite 1 is a four book science fiction series about an arranged marriage <em>extraordinaire</em>. </span></p>
<p><span>WHAT IS SOCIALITE</span></p>
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p><span>Ray and Grace Amis were chosen from 40 candidates for a mission that may save their people,the Zozians, from extinction: find a human willing to leave his home and family to serve as a fresh pool of genetic and social knowledge.  The success of the mission hinges on the Amis finding a mate for their daughter Elle.  Ray created the network, Socialite, so he can scour available knowledge about individual humans and find the most appropriate match for his daughter.  Socialite becomes a phenomenon, replacing search tools and social networks to become the main form of communication on Earth.  Ray and Grace chose Jacob Liebe, a one year old living in the small town called Mission located near Vancouver, British Columbia.  The Amis move into the house across the street from the Liebes, give birth to their daughter and live in seclusion for fourteen years, waiting for the right time to introduce their daughter to her chosen husband.</span></p>
<p><span>The full vision:</span></p>
<p><span>The book series combines a great story of suspense, action and romance with poetry, humour and importantly, music! While writing Socialite 1, I was continuously inspired to add songs within the text. The result is two songs integrated into the story of each book, creating a multimedia vision of the series.  As well, I was frequently inspired with ideas for both the future of the story and the backstory. The future will be realized in three book series that will follow Socialite 1.  Events from the distant past that eventually lead to the Amis’ adventures in Socialite 1 are being developed as the Zozian Diaries (anyone can begin reading it right now online at <a href=""http://zozian-diaries.blogspot.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://zozian-diaries.blogspot.ca</span></a>/ !)</span></p>
<p><span>WHAT IS COMPLETE SO FAR</span> </p>
<p><span>All four books of Socialite 1 are complete and available as ebooks from Amazon kindle store, Apple iBookstore and Kobo books.  The print versions are also complete and available through Amazon’s CreateSpace by going to this page: <a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/socialitebooks/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>https://sites.google.com/site/socialitebooks/</span></a> </span>.</p>
<p>The music of Socialite 1 is composed, and the complete lyrics for most of the songs are included in the text of the four books of this series. The video above includes samples of four of the songs (the recordings are of me singing and playing guitar into my laptop, for now).</p>
<p>I have started writing Socialite 2 and have composed all of the music for this second series.  I have also begun writing the Zozian Diaries and readers can check out the first few chapters right now online for free!</p>
<p>WHAT NEEDS TO BE COMPLETED</p>
<p>I am independently publishing this series.  The initial print run needs to be ordered.  Also the songs need to be recorded in a studio with additional musicians and singers.  The CD needs to be designed and produced. </p>
<p>Once these things are completed, I will need to market and “pound the pavement” to generate an interest for this exciting book series and for the accompanying music.</p>
<p>WHAT YOU GET</p>
<p>Lots of perks are available.  You decide if you want to read the series as an ebook or a traditional print book.  You can also get the music (once it is recorded) as a signed CD.  Perhaps you want a coffee cup with the logo of the DarkRoast coffee chain that features prominently in the series, or maybe you'd like me to use your name or the name of a loved one for a character in one of the books of the next series.  Check out all of the perks on the right side of this page.</p>
<p><span>OTHER WAYS TO PARTICIPATE</span></p>
<p>I am very grateful for all donations to this campaign. I am very passionate about this series and for that reason made the books accessible at the lowest perk level ($10 for all 4 ebooks!).</p>
<p>I realize that some people are not able contribute monetarily.</p>
<p>Everyone can help this project just by liking the Socialitebooks facebook page, telling a friend about the books and reading the free Zozian Diaries blog online and leaving comments.   </p>
<p>Thank you very much for helping to bring this project to life!</p>

Ray and Grace Amis were chosen from 40 candidates for a mission that may save their people,the Zozians, from extinction: find a human willing to leave his home and family to serve as a fresh pool of genetic and social knowledge.  The success of the mission hinges on the Amis finding a mate for their daughter Elle.  Ray created the network, Socialite, so he can scour available knowledge about individual humans and find the most appropriate match for his daughter.  Socialite becomes a phenomenon, replacing search tools and social networks to become the main form of communication on Earth.  Ray and Grace chose Jacob Liebe, a one year old living in the small town called Mission located near Vancouver, British Columbia.  The Amis move into the house across the street from the Liebes, give birth to their daughter and live in seclusion for fourteen years, waiting for the right time to introduce their daughter to her chosen husband.
The full vision:
The book series combines a great story of suspense, action and romance with poetry, humour and importantly, music! While writing Socialite 1, I was continuously inspired to add songs within the text. The result is two songs integrated into the story of each book, creating a multimedia vision of the series.  As well, I was frequently inspired with ideas for both the future of the story and the backstory. The future will be realized in three book series that will follow Socialite 1.  Events from the distant past that eventually lead to the Amis’ adventures in Socialite 1 are being developed as the Zozian Diaries (anyone can begin reading it right now online at http://zozian-diaries.blogspot.ca/ !)
WHAT IS COMPLETE SO FAR 
All four books of Socialite 1 are complete and available as ebooks from Amazon kindle store, Apple iBookstore and Kobo books.  The print versions are also complete and available through Amazon’s CreateSpace by going to this page: https://sites.google.com/site/socialitebooks/ .
The music of Socialite 1 is composed, and the complete lyrics for most of the songs are included in the text of the four books of this series. The video above includes samples of four of the songs (the recordings are of me singing and playing guitar into my laptop, for now).
I have started writing Socialite 2 and have composed all of the music for this second series.  I have also begun writing the Zozian Diaries and readers can check out the first few chapters right now online for free!
WHAT NEEDS TO BE COMPLETED
I am independently publishing this series.  The initial print run needs to be ordered.  Also the songs need to be recorded in a studio with additional musicians and singers.  The CD needs to be designed and produced. 
Once these things are completed, I will need to market and “pound the pavement” to generate an interest for this exciting book series and for the accompanying music.
WHAT YOU GET
Lots of perks are available.  You decide if you want to read the series as an ebook or a traditional print book.  You can also get the music (once it is recorded) as a signed CD.  Perhaps you want a coffee cup with the logo of the DarkRoast coffee chain that features prominently in the series, or maybe you'd like me to use your name or the name of a loved one for a character in one of the books of the next series.  Check out all of the perks on the right side of this page.
OTHER WAYS TO PARTICIPATE
I am very grateful for all donations to this campaign. I am very passionate about this series and for that reason made the books accessible at the lowest perk level ($10 for all 4 ebooks!).
I realize that some people are not able contribute monetarily.
Everyone can help this project just by liking the Socialitebooks facebook page, telling a friend about the books and reading the free Zozian Diaries blog online and leaving comments.

<p><strong>This book is for women of all ages.  </strong>Those with kids and those without.  For those who are hearing the silent whispers of there being something more for them in their lifetime.  Those not negating where their lives currently are, but those looking for more fulfillment, to live their purpose, or to enhance the life they currently have. </p>

Past jobs as translator and writer of role-playing games, editor for an italian fantasy/sci-fi/RPG magazine, illustrator (as shown by the arts of most of my books) and music: sax player, owner of a web-radio (TWM Relaxing Radio), and frontman of The Wimshurst’s Machine, italian-based steampunk-inspired ambient orchestra that got three nominations at the ""Hollywood Music in Media Awards"" (2010, 2011 e 2012).

</p><p>I read 'If I Were King' to my nephews and they enjoyed it as well as I did. The bright and fun illustrations transported us to Africa. The book uses a clever way to convey an important message: 'It is okay to be adventurous while recognizing your friends and being extra careful when it comes to their ""turf"" or boundaries.' I don't think I've read them a book before as enjoyable as this one where differences between people are celebrated and one finds his/her comfort zone among people of different background. Great book!</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Unable to agree on their ideas about God and religious celebrations, four different ethnic tribes—Greeks, Chinese, Zulus, and Mayans—who live together harmoniously most of the year, combining aspects of each of their cultures to make their kingdom strong and prosperous, suddenly become divisive when religious holidays approach. During such times, they cannot agree on the timing or manner of religious traditions, and they each have their own god who looks and dresses as they do. When Niko, a young Greek boy, has several dreams of God, each tribe interprets the various details of his dreams according to its own view of God, further emphasizing the tribes’ differences in beliefs. Subsequently Niko is shunned for having created even more disharmony and for lying to the tribes, or so they think, as no one believes he dreamed of God. To clear up all the confusion and arrive at the truth, Niko begs God to manifest in one final dream. This time God shows him that the tribes’ beliefs are actually different expressions of the same god. Niko concludes that God is like colorless and formless iridescent light and the beliefs of all tribes about their gods are correct as these gods are like colors of the rainbow that derive from white light.</span></p>

My name is Randa Handler.  Working at the UN with people from many races and nationalities who welcomed each other's cultures influenced me.  People can get along despite their differences! After spending some years as an international journalist, publicist and publisher, I embarked on a journey writing and illustrating children's books with that message. I am convinced that when you teach kids that differences are just gems to be cherished and not problems, the world would really be a better place as you will be wiping away hate!

What We Need & What You Get
I am raising money to print 3,000 copies each of 2 of my books as I would like to send as many free copies to elementary school teachers as possible.
Both books will be printed as hardcovers. If we are unable to reach our whole campaign amount we will print smaller quantities. But for a national campaign 3k is a small quantity.

The Impact
My goal is to try and make a difference with a message of tolerance of difference conveyed in a fun way without being preachy. Elementary school teachers have indicated their approval by leaving messages at my FB page and even reviewing books.  I'm so glad that they agree with me that the earlier we can start helping kids understand and appreciate cultural differences the better our world will be.

5 Stars* By Roger Awn - 
Once again, Randa Handler writes a masterful story where the belief in god and religion is shown to enhance rather than destroy harmony among diverse cultures.
5 Stars* By Jessica Warne (Elementary School Teacher/ CA USA) - 
This story portrays God as loving and accessible, as well as willing and able to answer heartfelt questions about harmony, unity and diversity in human relations. All this is beautifully accomplished through a child's earnest effort to simply solve a difficult problem in his village. If or when different religious beliefs are causing conflict, this is the book to give to either children or adults.
5 Stars* By Steve - 
Ms. Handler's style is perfect to teach children these qualities as its tone is neither preachy nor heavy-handed. I recommend this book to all parents and teachers to use to teach children about religious tolerance.

</p><p>Hi. I'm Khadija Anderson, host of
Desert Addicts Writers' Camp. Desert Addicts Writers' Camp is an annual writers
retreat dedicated to offering outstanding and affordable poetry and non-fiction
writing workshops in the desert. Our first Writer's Camp was held in May 2013 at
a public campground in Joshua Tree National Park. Our next project is a
permanent home for the Desert Addicts Writer's Camp at a private desert
property near Joshua Tree. But I need your help.</p>
<p>I need to raise $2500 to cover the
cost of basic necessities at the base camp or we will once again have to
use a good portion of participant fees to rent noisy, crowded campsites, while that money <i>should</i> be used to pay our workshop leaders what they deserve for all
their hard work.  So I'm turning to
you, our strongest supporters, to ask for contributions. In exchange, we're
offering thank you gifts such as postcards, books, and private writing
consultations. Your contribution will help us complete our base camp and beyond
that, it will help future writers participate in affordable annual desert
writing retreats. </p>
<p>What we need is $2500 to purchase a composting toilet, solar
generator, materials to build a shade pergola, and the means with which to tow
a donated Airstream trailer from Seattle to the property.</p>
<p>The thank you gifts we are offering are Desert Addicts
Writers' Camp postcards, a hand bound chapbook of 3 woodcuts and poems about
the desert, a gorgeous anthology of desert writings, a poetry book pack of
wonderful local poets, and a private consultation with either one of our
workshop leaders either during this year's camp or via skype.</p>
<p>If we don't meet our entire goal, we will use the money
collected to get as many items on the list as possible.</p>
<p>Even if you can't donate monetarily, please use the
Indiegogo share tools to spread the word.</p>
<p>Thanks so much!!!</p>

<strong>Money.</strong> (No point in beating around the bush.) <br/>
</p><p>Here is how we will spend it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Materials for the incentives.</strong> All that fun stuff has to come from somewhere!</li>
<li>
<strong>Living expenses.</strong> Food, bills, and a roof to turn away the life-leeching rays of the blazing hatestar – sorry, <em>the sun</em>. We have this annoying hierarchy of needs thing going on. <em>Damn you, Maslow!</em>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Medical care.</strong> Writing all these naughty words can 
be dangerous, you know. Paper cuts, repetitive stress injuries, tragic 
Hitachi accidents . . . it's a brutal line of work. (Have you ever tried
 to get lube out of a keyboard?) No, seriously, some of us need to be 
medicated for the public good.</li>

Is that exciting? No! But we have to stay alive to write smut. Contrary 
to what you might think, zombies don't write very interesting sex 
scenes. It's just a lot of moaning and cannibalism.</p>
<h2>What Happens:</h2>
<p>We post the book serially on our site. This will be our 13th novel, 
and we've never failed to post three serial updates a week. We are 
reliable. The story <em>will</em> be finished on time. It is projected to run between 45 and 50 chapters, and should be between 125,000 and 150,000 words.</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>We are on a mission to publish the first comprehensive
gluten free guide book! “Goodbye Gluten, Hello Delicious: Your Guide To Going
Completely Gluten Free”, written by Delicious Alchemy founder Emma Killilea,
will change the lives of those on restricted diets by offering advice, recipe
ideas and a 30-day meal planner. We are looking to raise the production and
publishing costs of the book, and once published, all proceeds of the book will
go to our brand new charity – the Delicious Alchemy Charitable Foundation.</b></p>My name is <a href=""http://www.deliciousalchemy.co.uk/emmas-story/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Emma Killilea</a>,
I have coeliac disease, and 10 years ago I founded a gluten free food company
called <a href=""http://www.deliciousalchemy.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Delicious Alchemy</a>. In celebration of our 10 year anniversary, we are
setting up a charity called the <a href=""http://www.deliciousalchemy.co.uk/charity/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Delicious Alchemy Charitable Foundation</a>. This
is the first fundraiser we are doing for the foundation and it’s part of a
very ambitious project that we hope you will become part of!
<p>We want to raise over
£16,000 to put towards the production costs of the book I am writing to help people who need to transition from a gluten filled diet, to a gluten free diet. These costs will cover things such as beautiful food photography to compliment the recipes which will appear in
the book. The book will be one of a kind – it’s not only a
recipe book, it’s a supportive helping hand to guide and assist people. </p>
<p></p>

<p>We are aiming to make
this book a <b>worldwide bestseller</b> and
all proceeds of the book will go to the Foundation. This is why we need you to
come on board!</p>
<p>The aim of Delicious
Alchemy is to improve the lives of people on a restricted diet and the
foundation is one of the ways we are making that happen. The Foundation will donate money
and food to other charities and worthy causes that share our aims. As an
example, we are donating gluten free food to the foodbanks supported by the
Trussell Trust in the UK and we will be supporting medical and scientific
research programmes that aim to find cures for, or ease the symptoms of those
with, gluten related problems. </p>

<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul></ul>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><p></p>
<ul><li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We need £16,000 for the production costs of the book. As well as funding the editing and typesetting of the book, it will also go towards really beautiful food
     photography and food styling to compliment the gorgeous recipes in the
     book. To create a worldwide best-seller, we need the book to be inspiring and
     for people to be proud to exhibit it on their kitchen shelf. </span></li></ul>
<ul><li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">We have a huge variety of exciting perks that are
exclusively available to our Indiegogo supporters, and won’t be available to
anyone else! These include joining us on a whistle stop tour of Paris – we’ll
be going on a 24-hour trip via the Eurostar to eat at an exclusively gluten
free bakery, patisserie and restaurant that we love there. If you don’t fancy
that, you could become an exclusive Product Tester for one whole year – getting
your hands on brand new Delicious Alchemy products before anyone else! You
could also get a signed copy of the book, or a social shout out with our gratitude.
So, if you are passionate about free from food being available to food banks
throughout the UK, if you’re a self-confessed foodie, or you just want to get
your hands on the book – we have something to suit you. </span></li></ul>
<ul><li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">If we don’t reach our goal, whatever we have raised
will go towards the food photography and food styling. Ultimately everyone
penny is going towards the charity. If we over fund, which
hopefully we will, the extra money will go towards the publishing costs of the
book, such as the editing, the typesetting, design, etc. </span></li></ul></span>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>21% of households in the
UK alone contain at least one person who is avoiding a minimum of one allergen
for health reasons. The top three allergens avoided are gluten, dairy and
peanuts. Gluten-related symptoms range from life-threatening, to life-limiting to
varying levels of discomfort, and the only way for sufferers to avoid being ill
is to go on a gluten free diet. </p>
<p>It’s extremely difficult
to move onto a gluten free diet and it’s even more difficult to maintain it –
gluten is in everything! These people, like me, need this diet for health
reasons, many of them serious, therefore helping people to achieve, and
ultimately to enjoy, this life-long regime is very important. </p>
<p>Raising awareness for
the conditions that a gluten free diet is known to cure or improve is also
important. Coeliac disease is a very serious condition and a gluten free diet
cures it but did you know that people with arthritis, Crohn’s disease, autism
and colitis can also benefit from a gluten free diet? </p>
<p>Myself, and everyone at
Delicious Alchemy, want people on restricted diets to know what they can and
cannot eat and I want to see them out and about with their friends, enjoying
life and all it has to offer! We don’t want them inadvertently eating gluten
and being ill for days on end or being too scared to leave the house in case
they get poisoned. Unfortunately, this is the reality for many people so let’s
change it!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Challenges &amp; <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Other Ways You Can Help</span>
</h3> <p></p>
<p>The main risk we face is
that this crowdfund campaign does not reach the people who need the help. If
you know anyone who would benefit from our book or charity, please send them
this link so that we can fund and hopefully overfund our goal! Please post it
on your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram and even My Space (if you still
have it!) . You can also use the Indiegogo share buttons at the top of the page. </p>
<p>We know that gluten-related
medical conditions are on the rise and more and more people need a book like
this to help them. </p>

pretty recipe books out there but none that truly guide people through what can
be a frightening and lonely journey.  Please help us to spread the word and make this project happen! </p>

</div></div>","We are on a mission to publish the first comprehensive
gluten free guide book! “Goodbye Gluten, Hello Delicious: Your Guide To Going
Completely Gluten Free”, written by Delicious Alchemy founder Emma Killilea,
will change the lives of those on restricted diets by offering advice, recipe
ideas and a 30-day meal planner. We are looking to raise the production and
publishing costs of the book, and once published, all proceeds of the book will
go to our brand new charity – the Delicious Alchemy Charitable Foundation.My name is Emma Killilea,
I have coeliac disease, and 10 years ago I founded a gluten free food company
called Delicious Alchemy. In celebration of our 10 year anniversary, we are
setting up a charity called the Delicious Alchemy Charitable Foundation. This
is the first fundraiser we are doing for the foundation and it’s part of a
very ambitious project that we hope you will become part of!
We want to raise over
£16,000 to put towards the production costs of the book I am writing to help people who need to transition from a gluten filled diet, to a gluten free diet. These costs will cover things such as beautiful food photography to compliment the recipes which will appear in
the book. The book will be one of a kind – it’s not only a
recipe book, it’s a supportive helping hand to guide and assist people. 



We are aiming to make
this book a worldwide bestseller and
all proceeds of the book will go to the Foundation. This is why we need you to
come on board!
The aim of Delicious
Alchemy is to improve the lives of people on a restricted diet and the
foundation is one of the ways we are making that happen. The Foundation will donate money
and food to other charities and worthy causes that share our aims. As an
example, we are donating gluten free food to the foodbanks supported by the
Trussell Trust in the UK and we will be supporting medical and scientific
research programmes that aim to find cures for, or ease the symptoms of those
with, gluten related problems. 




   What We Need & What You Get


We need £16,000 for the production costs of the book. As well as funding the editing and typesetting of the book, it will also go towards really beautiful food
     photography and food styling to compliment the gorgeous recipes in the
     book. To create a worldwide best-seller, we need the book to be inspiring and
     for people to be proud to exhibit it on their kitchen shelf. 
We have a huge variety of exciting perks that are
exclusively available to our Indiegogo supporters, and won’t be available to
anyone else! These include joining us on a whistle stop tour of Paris – we’ll
be going on a 24-hour trip via the Eurostar to eat at an exclusively gluten
free bakery, patisserie and restaurant that we love there. If you don’t fancy
that, you could become an exclusive Product Tester for one whole year – getting
your hands on brand new Delicious Alchemy products before anyone else! You
could also get a signed copy of the book, or a social shout out with our gratitude.
So, if you are passionate about free from food being available to food banks
throughout the UK, if you’re a self-confessed foodie, or you just want to get
your hands on the book – we have something to suit you. 
If we don’t reach our goal, whatever we have raised
will go towards the food photography and food styling. Ultimately everyone
penny is going towards the charity. If we over fund, which
hopefully we will, the extra money will go towards the publishing costs of the
book, such as the editing, the typesetting, design, etc. 
  The Impact 
21% of households in the
UK alone contain at least one person who is avoiding a minimum of one allergen
for health reasons. The top three allergens avoided are gluten, dairy and
peanuts. Gluten-related symptoms range from life-threatening, to life-limiting to
varying levels of discomfort, and the only way for sufferers to avoid being ill
is to go on a gluten free diet. 
It’s extremely difficult
to move onto a gluten free diet and it’s even more difficult to maintain it –
gluten is in everything! These people, like me, need this diet for health
reasons, many of them serious, therefore helping people to achieve, and
ultimately to enjoy, this life-long regime is very important. 
Raising awareness for
the conditions that a gluten free diet is known to cure or improve is also
important. Coeliac disease is a very serious condition and a gluten free diet
cures it but did you know that people with arthritis, Crohn’s disease, autism
and colitis can also benefit from a gluten free diet? 
Myself, and everyone at
Delicious Alchemy, want people on restricted diets to know what they can and
cannot eat and I want to see them out and about with their friends, enjoying
life and all it has to offer! We don’t want them inadvertently eating gluten
and being ill for days on end or being too scared to leave the house in case
they get poisoned. Unfortunately, this is the reality for many people so let’s
change it!

Our Challenges & Other Ways You Can Help
 
The main risk we face is
that this crowdfund campaign does not reach the people who need the help. If
you know anyone who would benefit from our book or charity, please send them
this link so that we can fund and hopefully overfund our goal! Please post it
on your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram and even My Space (if you still
have it!) . You can also use the Indiegogo share buttons at the top of the page. 
We know that gluten-related
medical conditions are on the rise and more and more people need a book like
this to help them. 



There are plenty of
pretty recipe books out there but none that truly guide people through what can
be a frightening and lonely journey.  Please help us to spread the word and make this project happen! 

Thank you for viewing our Indiegogo page - if you like the idea of the book but donating on here isn't really your thing, you can sign up to our newsletter to be kept up to date with when the book will be available to purchase. Sign up here: http://confirmsubscription.com/h/d/FB2A27F3A912...

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<i>Yellow Boxes</i> is a book that follows a half-Korean girl searching for her mother in a dream world that twists and coils her reality irreparably. At the same time, an auntie appears, urging beautifully wrapped yellow presents onto the girl and her nine sisters.<br/><br/>My name is Eun Hye Kim and I am the author of <i>Yellow Boxes</i>. I wrote this book because I've always been fascinated with dream and alternate worlds, particularly the strange ways in which the familiar manifests and lingers with us, even into our wakening.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will identify with what seeps in and takes shape for a tightly-enclosed family of ten girls in their mother's absence. Through this book, I want people to see their own family beyond their given roles of <i>mother, father, sister, aunt</i>... My immigrant parents work six days a week, which has accumulated into almost two decades now, in the consuming life of running a restaurant. It is bittersweet to compare the parents I know with the people they were in the faded photos of old albums, when they used to be called by their names – not only someone's mother or father. Ultimately I hope you can come out of this book seeking to understand the people closest to us more carefully, especially the parts of them that are still strange to you, before it is too late.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about love, and the ways in which it sustains and destroys people:<ul>
<li>Yeo-deol, the main character, who tries to trace back to the root of maternal love</li>
<li>Daddy, who chases a great, divine love</li>
<li>Mama, who is haunted by the ghostly strings of fated love</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you have a taste for magical realism and stories that bring you back to familial relationships, and the different way we tug at and tie ourselves within them.<br/><br/><i>Yellow Boxes</i> is a fiction book that speaks to young adults emerging into their own lives who are looking at their identity within and outside of their family.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Book - <i>Yellow Boxes</i>
</h2>
<p>The book sets out on the day that Yeo-deol Henderson turns 29 years old – the same age as her Mama was the winter that she disappeared, leaving Yeo-deol's father and nine other sisters in a desolate house. Yeo-deol goes back to this winter 14 years ago, when she slept through most of the days and a woman claiming to be their auntie began to ring their doorbell, offering beautifully wrapped yellow presents.</p>

<p><strong>Story of My Book</strong></p>
<p><i>Are We Failing Our Kids? Mental Health and Education </i>is about mental health and the US education system (K-12). My book explores what is and is not being done, on the grade school level, to help students who are living with a mental illness.<br/><br/>My name is Andrea Shaker and I am the author of <i>Are We Failing Our Kids? Mental Health and Education.</i> I wrote this book because I wanted to create awareness and conversations about the mental health services and education in the US schools system but also to the areas that need improvement in the US school system regarding mental health.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover more about mental health in the US education system. I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the topic.

She believes this end to stigma starts with children and through the education system by increasing the mental health services and merging mental health education in the curriculum for every age level. Andrea hopes that the book will create enough conversations to make changes to better the services that are already there, create more services, and increase the amount/quality of mental health education in the U.S school system.<br/><br/>Andrea likes to dance, hike, swim, read, travel, spend time with friends and family.

Mental Health and Education is a nonfiction book that speaks to parents, educators, mental health professionals, education policy makers, etc. who want to look at mental health and education in a new way. The Book - Are We Failing Our Kids? Mental Health and Education.The book is written in 3 parts.Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1-3. In this section of the book you will learn about the history of mental health in the US school system from stigma and silence to policies put in place. Also, in this section you will hear why mental health education and services are important in U.S school system at this time. For example, how events occurring in the US such as racial trauma, mass shootings, bullying, suicide, substance use, pandemic, etc. are effecting our children’s mental health and how services in school and education can help reduce this effect.Part 2 contains chapters 4-12. In this section of the book you will hear first hand personal experiences from former or present students in the U.S school system who struggle with mental illness and how schools assisted them with this.

Andrea is a caring and loving person who always puts others before herself and always see’s the best in others.Andrea’s passion is to make mental health a common topic that is talked about and checked on and not one that people are afraid to discuss or admit to due to stigma. She believes this end to stigma starts with children and through the education system by increasing the mental health services and merging mental health education in the curriculum for every age level. Andrea hopes that the book will create enough conversations to make changes to better the services that are already there, create more services, and increase the amount/quality of mental health education in the U.S school system.Andrea likes to dance, hike, swim, read, travel, spend time with friends and family.

We all have a feeling of wanting to do more, to be a part of greater purpose. We can let this feeling control us and let us feel like we are wasting our days, or we can use it to create our vision and guide our activity for today.</p><p>My name is Adam Arafat and I am the author of <i>BE SOMEONE</i>. I wrote this book because a few years ago I was struggling with my direction in life. I have always had this need to be a part of something greater, to be actively working towards something. When I started my first job out of University, I isolated this feeling and observed how it influenced my decision making in the past. I discussed this with colleagues and interviewed professionals across industries and discovered we all have this feeling in some capacity. I have heard it been described as an ""entrepreneurial spirit."" Through my research, I have discovered those that have become someone, or have built legacies that made significant impacts in their communities and beyond had a clearly defined vision of who they wanted to be and what they wanted to accomplish. The book goes in depth on how to feed your entrepreneurial spirit, find, define and evolve your vision by defining for yourself what it means to be someone. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover your vision of who you want to be by learning from the stories of others that have found theirs. With this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for active legacy building. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you find inspiration to define your vision so that you can look forward to overcoming every obstacle in the way of building your legacy. <br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about visions that formed industry leading technology companies and visions that power global social impact movements as well as the unfolding events of 2020:</p><ul>
<li>Tales from traveling abroad at the dawn of the global pandemic COVID-19 and how 2020 is a time of change economically, socially, and politically.</li>
<li>Exclusive interview with Technology Entrepreneur Tom Gonser and the founding of DocuSign. </li>
<li>Brave stories from those highly involved in the Black Lives Matter movement and on the ground coverage of the short lived CHAZ/CHOP (Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone/Capital Hill Organized Protest)  </li>

<p>(Hiya folks, Publisher Mike G. here. As with issue #1, the demand for our magazine just doesn't stop when the Kickstarter does — so I've set up this campaign.

<p> </p>
<p>Last fall, we launched The American Bystander, a print humor quarterly designed to bring comedy into the 20th Century. We wanted to see if there was still an audience for a classic humor magazine format. You know -- comics, essays, short stories, all backed by beautiful design -- the kind of thing millions of people loved and bought in The National Lampoon, SPYand The Realist.<br/><br/>The reaction we received was beyond our wildest hopes. We made our goal in four days, and nearly doubled the amount we were shooting for. So far, with almost no publicity, we've sold nearly 2000 softcover books, at $25 a piece. Wowsers.</p>
<p>So...we're doing it again. And we've made the changes that our backers asked for. <br/><br/>First, it's cheaper -- $20 instead of $25. Our costs per issue go down the more we print, we'll keep dropping the price as long as the number of readers goes up. So if you want #3 to be cheaper still, back this one!</p>
<p>Second, we've simplified the pledge levels, and kept them affordable. </p>
<p>Third, there are more comics in this one, tons more short pieces, and more writing and art by women. </p>
<p>Finally, if we get enough backers, we're offering subscriptions. One year (four issues) in print or PDF format. There are publishing reasons we have to do this as a stretch goal; find out more under ""Stretch Goals"" below.</p>
<p>We've kept all the things you liked, and added all the things you asked for. Plus, just like #1, we are paying our contributors, and letting them keep all the rights to their material. <br/><br/>Issue #1 proved that people still liked classic humor magazines. Is there an audience big enough to keep the party going indefinitely? It's up to you.</p>
<p>(Some of) THE PEOPLE IN THIS ONE:<br/>Charles Barsotti (The New Yorker), Merrill Markoe (Late Night With David Letterman), Liza Donnelly (The New Yorker), Zach Bornstein (Jimmy Kimmel Live), MK Brown (National Lampoon), Shary Flenniken (National Lampoon), Liana Finck (The New Yorker), Howard Cruse(Stuck Rubber Baby), Jack Handey (SNL, The New Yorker), Todd Hanson (The Onion), John Howell Harris (The Onion), Brian McConnachie (National Lampoon, SNL, SCTV), Mallory Ortberg (The Toast, Slate), Mike Reiss (The Simpsons), Nell Scovell (SPY), Steve Young (The Late Show With David Letterman)...and many more!</p>

<h2><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">THE STORY</span></h2>
<p>My novel is the synthesis of psychedelic initiation and biblical adventure, enacted by a fractal collection of our gods upon an irradiated island beyond the outskirts of a pre-apocalyptic empire.</p>
<p>The best comparison I've concocted is to the Lord of the Rings remixed by Philip K. Dick.</p>
<p>The events thus depicted address, in large part, a question near and dear to my heart:</p>
<p>Has our species already wrought changes on this planet that will make it uninhabitable to us?</p>
<p>This is not something that we can answer, but the likelihood of suicide merits our deepest reflection.</p>
<p>In our culture, there is often talk of ""saving the world.""  My story posits the view that the world doesn't need to be saved; and that for us to think that we could do so is a perversion of the same arrogance that has caused its destruction at our hands.</p>
<p>Our potentially impossible quest is for the preservation of an environment that affords humans a modicum of hospitality.  The world's would-be champions are hesitant to admit this, for fear of seeming anthropocentric.  To me, saving ourselves as a part of (rather than apart from) creation is a goal no less important than saving the whole world, albeit somewhat more realistic.</p>
<p>ENTHEOGENESIS takes place in a world very much like ours; which is to say one of overshot carrying capacity.  It is an America with a government that can fabricate history and erase dissent with keystrokes; whose doctrine of preemptive counterattack has been logically extended to encompass nuclear warfare; when famine has driven people to voluntary imprisonment; and where the remaining natural resources are consolidated in the service of corporate profiteering.</p>
<p>Yet is also a world of hope, where a few intrepid pioneers endeavor to repurpose the detritus of civilization for a future more beautiful, abundant, and peaceful than ours.</p>
<p>Our narrator provides a bridge between the two.  He begins his tale as an alienated, ungrounded drug dealer lost in the chemical labyrinth of his own brain, and he ends it as the impassioned curator of an underground seedbank on a retribalized island.  In order to understand the journey that transforms his consciousness, you will have to read the book.</p>
<h2><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">MY LIFE AND THE WRITING PROCESS<br/></span></h2>
<p>I first wrote this novel when I was 17, but that version was for my eyes only.  At the time, I was simultaneously influenced by psychedelia and prominent members of the anthropological and ecological intelligentsia.  However, I remained disdainful of their predominant mode of exposition, wherein the problems afflicting (and inflicted by) humanity are described in excruciating detail, but a realistic solution is not.  I have always imagined myself writing professionally; but wanted to do so from a platform of practical experience, so as to turn the evolutionary tide from academics to action.  I dropped out of high school for a different path; and perhaps I am merely jealous of credentials, since I lack any.  Regardless, I avoided the ""armchair environmentalism"" I would criticize in others by applying myself inextricably to a course of self-education.  I've learned about my subsistence, and my effects on the living world (of which I am a part), by taking direct responsibility for them, from the ground up, at Earthaven Ecovillage.</p>
<p>I arrived here with little more than ambition, and my endeavor ever since has been to foster the synergistic integration of systems that perpetuate human existence, such that the products of one become the inputs of another, and waste is eliminated as a concept.  To this end, I work in any arenas where sunlight is harvested or wealth is grown - as a forester, organic farmer, installer of renewable energy, and designer/builder/project manager for sustainable human settlements.  In July 2011, during the somewhat anticlimactic culmination of my efforts here, I experienced the sudden concrescence of my various vocations and interests, via the vision of a new novel loosely based on my first.  I knew from the moment of my epiphany that <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">ENTHEOGENESIS</span> would involve sailing; and because I had no relevant experience, I decided that I would need to gain some in order to write about it credibly.  For five restless months, I incubated my ideas for the book, while I finished a custom house under a tight deadline, saved money, and made arrangements to facilitate the adventure.</p>
<p>By 12.21.11, I had disentangled myself enough from responsibilities at home to leave and undertake the writing project in earnest.  My intention and budget permitted me a year for the purpose.  I began by doing prognostic research, revisiting some of the settings already familiar to me, and exploring Block Island for the first time. The latter was a powerful source of inspiration; critical elements of the story seemed to fall into place as I discovered them.  Then I isolated myself, with my incipient composition, aboard a sailboat with only one other person (the boat owner/captain).  I disconnected myself from the concerns of work and the distractions of modern communications, and thereby created the conditions which enabled my manuscript to erupt within the eight weeks following my departure from Earthaven.</p>
<p>When the reality of my completed draft sunk in, I was excited by the prospect of not only being finished, but possibly being published, on 12.21.12 - significant partially because it is one year after the beginning of my project, but more so because of its importance to Terence McKenna, the quintessential experiential intellectual, to whom my novel pays homage.</p>
<p>I devoted entire insomniac nights of intention while sailing to this date, and undertook the conventional route to publication.  I soon learned that it is very difficult for a first time author (who isn't already a celebrity) to even make submissions without a literary agent.  Furthermore, obtaining one is unlikely, and an arduous process at best.  For their services, the agent receives 15-20% of the earnings from sale of an author's ""rights"" to their own work.  I spent two months querying agencies (about 70 in all); and whenever I received responses (which was not terribly often), they read to the effect of, ""I admire your work, but don't know how to sell it.""</p>
<p>Needless to say, that didn't last very long.  I am not going to let my novel gather dust while waiting for agents and publishers to validate it on the basis of profitability, any more than I was willing to let institutions evaluate my potential contribution as a human being in terms of GPA and SATs.  I have an urgent message, and a unique story that must be told.  I believe in humanity, and in destiny.  I know a rare opportunity when I see one, and I'm going for this one, ""all-in"", as they say in some circles.</p>
<h2><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>HEMP PAPER</strong></span></h2>
<p>In the village depicted by my novel, <em>Cannabis</em> is much more than a crop; it is a cornerstone in their agricultural and economic mosaic.  For reference sake, I brought <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The Great Book of Hemp</span> on my sailing trip.  What struck me the most was the final page, which reads:</p>
<p>""<strong>Every reasonable effort</strong> was made by Inner Traditions to print <em>The Great Book of Hemp</em> on hemp paper.  Unfortunately, imported hemp paper is still very expensive for large-scale use, and we were unable to do so.""</p>
<p>Hmmm.</p>
<p>Yet the United States remains the world's largest consumer of hemp.  <em>Cannabis</em> is ideally suited to our soil and climate; affords innumerable resources; and was so essential to our historical prosperity that, in some colonies, Americans were legally required to grow it.  Our Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were in fact drafted upon hemp paper.  Yet today, it is illegal to grow - because the Controlled Substances Act does not differentiate between marijuana and industrial hemp.</p>
<p>Instead, we have a wood-based pulp and paper industry, which is the third leading source of industrial pollution.  The material produced, often laden with toxic chemicals, coatings, and inks, eventually comes to represent over a third of American waste.  Meanwhile, a cultivated field of hemp can produce four times as much paper as the same area of trees through a non-toxic process, while sequestering carbon in the soil with organic methods.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>As always, you have to <strong>follow the money</strong>.  This subject is addressed in more detail by <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">ENTHEOGENESIS</span>, but for the moment it suffices to say that the present circumstances were created by the <strong>collusion</strong> of <strong>government</strong> (, <strong>private interests</strong> (petrochemicals, particularly the DuPont dynasty), and the <strong>media</strong> (Hearst, who drove the nail in the coffin of hemp newspaper).  The economic roadblocks to ecological sanity are, in the present day, such that the publishers of Inner Traditions may say, in truth, that they made every reasonable effort in their unsuccessful attempt to procure hemp paper.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I am a man characterized by<strong> unreasonable effort.</strong></p>
<p>In fact, I have been consistently drawn to allegedly insolvable problems and insurmountable challenges.  Perhaps this is why I cannot resist the pursuit of human speciation, instead of extinction; and it is why I remained undeterred in my quest to find paper that was worthy of my story.  In fact, the more elusive the material, the more attached to it I became.  As one of my characters says in the book:</p>
<p><strong>""I still refuse to accept America as it is as the best we can do</strong>.""</p>
<p>Yet I have no expectation that solutions will come from America as an institution.  The precedent set by prohibiting the cultivation of industrial hemp (after such a long tradition of our nation relying upon it) irrefutably indicates that politicians would rather deprive us of a cornerstone in our transitional strategy, than see their corporate sponsors make anything less than the greatest profits possible.</p>
<p>While sailing the Atlantic, I spent many long nights on watch reflecting on this, and decided that the single most significant legislative step that the United States could make for our culture's transition, and for the sake of our environment, is the repudiation of this ban.</p>
<p>Until it occurs, I believe that no one in the halls of American government has any business talking about sustainability, unless they refer to a constitutional amendment protecting my right to pursue it from the depredations of the DEA.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I aim to subvert branding, and harness the escalating trend toward commoditization of counterculture, to underscore the obscenity that is really going on here.  If you've read this far, I trust that you are willing to participate as well.</p>
<h2><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">MY PUBLISHING MODEL</span></h2>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>CONTEMPORARY CONTEXT</strong></span></p>
<p>The world of conventional book production is in tremendous upheaval, (which reflects the condition of our culture as a whole).  With the accessibility of print-on-demand technology, vanity book packagers on every corner, and cheap materials, anyone with a manuscript can become a published author.  Meanwhile, online vendors and E-books have upset the publishing dynasty known as ""The Big Six"", who now struggle to remain afloat by slashing their staff, reducing their offerings, and conspiring to fix E-book prices.</p>
<p>I brought an E-reader with me on my sailing adventure; considering the limitations on luggage, it proved to be an indispensable tool for research and reference during my composition.  Since this may, in fact, be the most sustainable publishing format currently available, I will offer <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">ENTHEOGENESIS</span> as an e-book to whoever desires it, in addition to the physical version made of the paper described above.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>THE EXTINCTION OF PRINTED BOOKS?</strong></span></p>
<p>This possibility is examined in the future history told by my novel; and for my part, I hope that it does not come to pass because I love books.  The sensations of actual pages; the fragrance of glue; the beauty of illustrations; and all of the other ""extras"" elevate writing to something that cannot be matched by text on a screen.  A collection of titles on a server does not conjure the same ambience as someone's hand-picked collection.</p>
<p>If we expect to have printed books in the future, we must be thinking now about how to produce them sustainably; thus will we be able to fill our shelves with volumes of aesthetic appeal, rather than remorse.  My hemp paper, textured as it is with flecks of green and brown vegetation, is beautiful on its own; and my first edition will also include several features I've always enjoyed in other books, such as deckle edge (to accentuate the paper), French flaps (for a more durable and interesting cover) and maps (to ground the story).  To ensure that publications with such features will be available to future generations, I selected my printer based on their reduction of landfill waste; run the offices of <strong>beLove </strong>on solar energy; and will fuel my nationwide publicity tour with biodiesel (see below for more information).</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>A NEW PARADIGM</strong></span></p>
<p>In the space between print-on-demand, electronic publishing, and the faltering ""Big Six"", lies the gap wherein the future of physical books may arise - in the form of small to medium runs from imprints such as my own.  It has been pointed out to me that my readers do not necessary feel the same, or as strongly, about the plight of industrial hemp as I do.  Therefore, the decision to add cost to book production, for a paper that may only console my own sensibilities, is my own responsibility.  True enough; and only as an independent publisher can I realize this luxury.</p>
<p>If I sold my manuscript, I would essentially lose control of my design, pricing, and printing.  Conventional publishers cannot afford to consider an author's ethical values; they make their decisions about book design based on their bottom line, as allegiance to shareholder interests dictates that they must.  Similarly, POD is a system made affordable simply by cookie-cutter design, cheap materials, and gross volume.</p>
<p>The only way to create a book that I can be proud of, while keeping my cover price in the ballpark for my category (15-20 USD), is to produce it myself, and to this end I have formed the<strong> beLove</strong> imprint.  My strategy is to offset out-of-pocket expenses wherever possible with my own time and energy.  At every step in book production, value (and thus cost) is added.  Through vertical integration, I can absorb some of the fees associated with my specialized book production myself, so that my readers don't have to.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">ARTI</span><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">S</span><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">U</span><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">NA</span><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">L ENTERPRISE<br/></span></strong></p>
<p>It is fortuitous that I am already practiced in the manifestation of this business model.  As a builder of custom homes, I have always involved myself in every detail, from schematic design to the processing of raw materials; from the harvest of the solar energy that powers the tools, to the selection of fixtures based on their lifecycle cost.  The integration of all the trades (by keeping a comprehensive array of services in-house), and the elimination of mark-ups or redundant labor whenever possible, are the means by which my business has consistently delivered exceedingly ecological buildings for prices that are competitive with conventional construction.</p>
<p>My observation is that, in the absence of necessity, people will only voluntarily subscribe to a transitional strategy when it is financially accessible.  As an entrepreneur, I have always sought to increase efficiency and reduce overhead so that I may have the satisfaction of offering a more ecological product (and thus more value) to my clients.  This mode of operation has applied to my work with design, construction, forestry, renewable energy, and agricultural products.  I now intend to bring the same ethics, of conscientious craftsmanship and authentic materials, to my publications.</p>
<p>It's no way to get rich, but that has never been my motivation.  I am motivated by challenges, and by the satisfaction of knowing that I gave my best effort to leave the world a better place than it would be without me.  In this case, there is the challenge of executing the project without losing money - in spite of the fact that my work lacks the guarantee of commercial success sought by the agents who rejected it.  Most of the time though, I feel that there is no ""why""; there is only me, and I am a process by which the will of the Universe is unfolded.</p>
<p>Above all, I know now that I would not have been satisfied with conventional publishing.  I would never have made my publication date, and thus my chance to pay tribute to Terence McKenna; nor would I have been able to use the hemp paper.  Now I get to have both, as well as the ability to create, or creatively collaborate on, all of my own graphics, layout, branding, and publicity.  Instead of squandering my efforts on queries destined for the literary slush pile, all of my work applies directly to the enhancement of my artwork, manuscript, and platform.  The learning curve in publishing very steep, but it is tremendously stimulating, and I'm having a blast overturning the system.</p>

<p>Although many of my endeavors at Earthaven have been eminently grant-worthy, I have never sought funding from such sources.  To me, the concept of sustainability implies an enterprise that can stand on its own financially; if it is subsidized by the wealth generated in the petroleum economy, then it becomes merely a palliative agent to justify the continuation of our destruction.  Furthermore, I don't have the patience to go through all the administrative waste of applications, grant reports, and so on; and I'm unwilling to compromise my values for the fiscal security of my organizations.  In the grand scheme, government funding and philanthropic contributions are mostly allocated to B.S., if you will; and it is not a funding system to which I will be subservient or that I care to validate.</p>
<p>Thus, the model of innovation that I believe will blaze the trail of our transition is ecological micro-enterprise, wherein the wealth of our future is earned organically.  Such businesses, with their risk/reward component, afford a more dynamic, cutting-edge, and evolutionary approach to our potential extinction than non-profits and such.  Crowdfunding, in turn, offers us all the perfect grassroots mechanism to directly support the endeavors that will in turn become the reality we seek.  As a ""cause"", I love the fact that I can market myself to, and correspond with, my stakeholders directly; and that doing so simultaneously strengthens both my network and platform.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">WHAT IF I DON'T REACH MY GOAL?<br/></span></strong></p>
<p>I will beg, borrow, or otherwise obtain the capital to proceed with the project.  However, any funds contributed to my Indiegogo campaign will afford me opportunity to devote more time to editing/improving my work, and promoting the finished book.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">WHAT IF I RECEIVE MORE THAN MY GOAL?</span></strong></p>
<p>If only I should be so fortunate ; )</p>
<p>First of all, I will cover the costs of fulfilling the perks I've offered.  Each dollar contributed does not translate to a dollar applied toward the paper, since, with each perk, I incur costs that are additional to the expenses of publishing (such as shipping, travel, merchandise, etc.)  At some point in the realm of $20-25K, I expect that I will be able to pay for both the perks AND the paper.  If I don't reach that point, I will pursue other sources of funding as necessary to make up the difference.</p>
<p>After the perks and paper are paid for, surplus funds will be used to increase the size of my initial printing if possible.  This will reduce my upfront cost per copy, and thus the cover price.  Also, contributions above and beyond my goal provide me working capital to increase the scope of my book publicity tour, reprint <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">ENTHEOGENESIS</span> sooner, expand my line of hemp merchandise, andor begin composition of the sequel/prequel sooner.</p>
<h2><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>MY EDITOR:</strong></span></h2>
<p>By starting my own imprint, I committed myself to (among other things) the responsibility of hiring my own editor.  With any literary connections to speak of, I hardly knew where to begin this process; but I had a specific ""fit"" in mind, and sought a relationship that would transcend marks on a page.  After an epic investigation, I had the exceedingly good fortune of encountering the illustrious Patrick Lobrutto at a moment conjunct with an opening in his schedule.</p>
<p>He has stewarded works of several authors that influenced me (such as Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, Philip K. Dick, etc.), and as editor of the ""Dune"" novels, is intimately familiar with the demands of constructing an imaginary alternate universe.  This is an important factor since I hope to work with the same editor on the other books in my series; someone who will, as Patrick put it, know my world better than anyone other than myself, in the end.  Thanks to his direct experience of the counterculture and psychedelic experience, he is perfectly positioned to understand what I aim to accomplish in the broader world with my work.  He is a legend among editors (how many have a Wikipedia page, after all?), with thirty-five years experience, who won the World Fantasy Award for editing.  Frankly, I was thrilled just to speak with him on the phone, let alone to have the once-in-a-lifetime chance to retain his services - which I did because we both agreed unequivocally that he is best editor money can buy for my project.</p>
<p>But what Pat brings to the table is much more than just expertise and prestige.  He offers a holistic view of the cosmos, a comprehensive understanding of the entire publishing industry, and the wisdom necessary to polish my raw vision into something worthy of publication (and thus, of your reading time).  I expect his knowledge of history, philosophy, mythology, and literature to improve my novel immensely; but his influence on the project extends to the cover design and publicity advice as well, and I am so honored to have him on my team.</p>

<p>August 7th is also Lammas, the cross-quarter date between the solstice and equinox.  As such, I will be through 5/8ths of the year I have afforded this project; and at this point, I will have galley copies of my novel produced to send to reviewers.</p>
<p>The actual book production will occur as soon after the galleys as possible, pending a final edit and delivery of the hemp/recycled paper to my printer.  I will have physical books for distribution to my Indiegogo contributors by the first week of November.  The distribution that I have in place should permit me to place books in stores by 12.21.12; but retail booksellers make their orders so far in advance of the Christmas season that the only way to secure your copy is to pre-order one here, or purchase one from me directly at one of my tour locations.</p>

<p>I hope that you'll spend a few moments browsing my perks, and that one (or more) might catch your fancy.  Regardless, there are also many ways you can contribute that don't necessarily involve spending US dollars.  In order to succeed, my campaign must achieve <strong>virality</strong>; if you tell other people about it, and they tell others, I can raise awareness by exponential growth and <strong>guerilla marketing</strong>, where the promotion of my project is based on its own merit, instead of conventional advertising machinations.</p>
<p>To help, you can recommend/forward my project to your family and co-workers; post a link to it on your blog; promote it on your Twitter account or share it on your Facebook wall and invite friends.  Send me your criticism or appreciation; offer to set up a book signing near you; get me an introduction or some coverage in the press.</p>
<p>Above all, I aim to advance our aspirations toward sustainability and cultural transition; selling my books is but one vehicle for the purpose.  I'm always interested in meeting dynamic people and exploring endeavors that go outside the box, if you care to share with me your ideas for advancing our collective cause.  And please don't hesitate to contact me about barter, non-monetary contributions, or any questions for might have about my campaign.</p>

THE STORY
My novel is the synthesis of psychedelic initiation and biblical adventure, enacted by a fractal collection of our gods upon an irradiated island beyond the outskirts of a pre-apocalyptic empire.
The best comparison I've concocted is to the Lord of the Rings remixed by Philip K. Dick.
The events thus depicted address, in large part, a question near and dear to my heart:
Has our species already wrought changes on this planet that will make it uninhabitable to us?
This is not something that we can answer, but the likelihood of suicide merits our deepest reflection.
In our culture, there is often talk of ""saving the world.""  My story posits the view that the world doesn't need to be saved; and that for us to think that we could do so is a perversion of the same arrogance that has caused its destruction at our hands.
Our potentially impossible quest is for the preservation of an environment that affords humans a modicum of hospitality.  The world's would-be champions are hesitant to admit this, for fear of seeming anthropocentric.  To me, saving ourselves as a part of (rather than apart from) creation is a goal no less important than saving the whole world, albeit somewhat more realistic.
ENTHEOGENESIS takes place in a world very much like ours; which is to say one of overshot carrying capacity.  It is an America with a government that can fabricate history and erase dissent with keystrokes; whose doctrine of preemptive counterattack has been logically extended to encompass nuclear warfare; when famine has driven people to voluntary imprisonment; and where the remaining natural resources are consolidated in the service of corporate profiteering.
Yet is also a world of hope, where a few intrepid pioneers endeavor to repurpose the detritus of civilization for a future more beautiful, abundant, and peaceful than ours.
Our narrator provides a bridge between the two.  He begins his tale as an alienated, ungrounded drug dealer lost in the chemical labyrinth of his own brain, and he ends it as the impassioned curator of an underground seedbank on a retribalized island.  In order to understand the journey that transforms his consciousness, you will have to read the book.
MY LIFE AND THE WRITING PROCESS
I first wrote this novel when I was 17, but that version was for my eyes only.  At the time, I was simultaneously influenced by psychedelia and prominent members of the anthropological and ecological intelligentsia.  However, I remained disdainful of their predominant mode of exposition, wherein the problems afflicting (and inflicted by) humanity are described in excruciating detail, but a realistic solution is not.  I have always imagined myself writing professionally; but wanted to do so from a platform of practical experience, so as to turn the evolutionary tide from academics to action.  I dropped out of high school for a different path; and perhaps I am merely jealous of credentials, since I lack any.  Regardless, I avoided the ""armchair environmentalism"" I would criticize in others by applying myself inextricably to a course of self-education.  I've learned about my subsistence, and my effects on the living world (of which I am a part), by taking direct responsibility for them, from the ground up, at Earthaven Ecovillage.
I arrived here with little more than ambition, and my endeavor ever since has been to foster the synergistic integration of systems that perpetuate human existence, such that the products of one become the inputs of another, and waste is eliminated as a concept.  To this end, I work in any arenas where sunlight is harvested or wealth is grown - as a forester, organic farmer, installer of renewable energy, and designer/builder/project manager for sustainable human settlements.  In July 2011, during the somewhat anticlimactic culmination of my efforts here, I experienced the sudden concrescence of my various vocations and interests, via the vision of a new novel loosely based on my first.  I knew from the moment of my epiphany that ENTHEOGENESIS would involve sailing; and because I had no relevant experience, I decided that I would need to gain some in order to write about it credibly.  For five restless months, I incubated my ideas for the book, while I finished a custom house under a tight deadline, saved money, and made arrangements to facilitate the adventure.
By 12.21.11, I had disentangled myself enough from responsibilities at home to leave and undertake the writing project in earnest.  My intention and budget permitted me a year for the purpose.  I began by doing prognostic research, revisiting some of the settings already familiar to me, and exploring Block Island for the first time. The latter was a powerful source of inspiration; critical elements of the story seemed to fall into place as I discovered them.  Then I isolated myself, with my incipient composition, aboard a sailboat with only one other person (the boat owner/captain).  I disconnected myself from the concerns of work and the distractions of modern communications, and thereby created the conditions which enabled my manuscript to erupt within the eight weeks following my departure from Earthaven.
When the reality of my completed draft sunk in, I was excited by the prospect of not only being finished, but possibly being published, on 12.21.12 - significant partially because it is one year after the beginning of my project, but more so because of its importance to Terence McKenna, the quintessential experiential intellectual, to whom my novel pays homage.
I devoted entire insomniac nights of intention while sailing to this date, and undertook the conventional route to publication.  I soon learned that it is very difficult for a first time author (who isn't already a celebrity) to even make submissions without a literary agent.  Furthermore, obtaining one is unlikely, and an arduous process at best.  For their services, the agent receives 15-20% of the earnings from sale of an author's ""rights"" to their own work.  I spent two months querying agencies (about 70 in all); and whenever I received responses (which was not terribly often), they read to the effect of, ""I admire your work, but don't know how to sell it.""
Needless to say, that didn't last very long.  I am not going to let my novel gather dust while waiting for agents and publishers to validate it on the basis of profitability, any more than I was willing to let institutions evaluate my potential contribution as a human being in terms of GPA and SATs.  I have an urgent message, and a unique story that must be told.  I believe in humanity, and in destiny.  I know a rare opportunity when I see one, and I'm going for this one, ""all-in"", as they say in some circles.
HEMP PAPER
In the village depicted by my novel, Cannabis is much more than a crop; it is a cornerstone in their agricultural and economic mosaic.  For reference sake, I brought The Great Book of Hemp on my sailing trip.  What struck me the most was the final page, which reads:
""Every reasonable effort was made by Inner Traditions to print The Great Book of Hemp on hemp paper.  Unfortunately, imported hemp paper is still very expensive for large-scale use, and we were unable to do so.""
Hmmm.
Yet the United States remains the world's largest consumer of hemp.  Cannabis is ideally suited to our soil and climate; affords innumerable resources; and was so essential to our historical prosperity that, in some colonies, Americans were legally required to grow it.  Our Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were in fact drafted upon hemp paper.  Yet today, it is illegal to grow - because the Controlled Substances Act does not differentiate between marijuana and industrial hemp.
Instead, we have a wood-based pulp and paper industry, which is the third leading source of industrial pollution.  The material produced, often laden with toxic chemicals, coatings, and inks, eventually comes to represent over a third of American waste.  Meanwhile, a cultivated field of hemp can produce four times as much paper as the same area of trees through a non-toxic process, while sequestering carbon in the soil with organic methods.
What happened?
As always, you have to follow the money.  This subject is addressed in more detail by ENTHEOGENESIS, but for the moment it suffices to say that the present circumstances were created by the collusion of government (, private interests (petrochemicals, particularly the DuPont dynasty), and the media (Hearst, who drove the nail in the coffin of hemp newspaper).  The economic roadblocks to ecological sanity are, in the present day, such that the publishers of Inner Traditions may say, in truth, that they made every reasonable effort in their unsuccessful attempt to procure hemp paper.
Fortunately, I am a man characterized by unreasonable effort.
In fact, I have been consistently drawn to allegedly insolvable problems and insurmountable challenges.  Perhaps this is why I cannot resist the pursuit of human speciation, instead of extinction; and it is why I remained undeterred in my quest to find paper that was worthy of my story.  In fact, the more elusive the material, the more attached to it I became.  As one of my characters says in the book:
""I still refuse to accept America as it is as the best we can do.""
Yet I have no expectation that solutions will come from America as an institution.  The precedent set by prohibiting the cultivation of industrial hemp (after such a long tradition of our nation relying upon it) irrefutably indicates that politicians would rather deprive us of a cornerstone in our transitional strategy, than see their corporate sponsors make anything less than the greatest profits possible.
While sailing the Atlantic, I spent many long nights on watch reflecting on this, and decided that the single most significant legislative step that the United States could make for our culture's transition, and for the sake of our environment, is the repudiation of this ban.
Until it occurs, I believe that no one in the halls of American government has any business talking about sustainability, unless they refer to a constitutional amendment protecting my right to pursue it from the depredations of the DEA.
In the meantime, I aim to subvert branding, and harness the escalating trend toward commoditization of counterculture, to underscore the obscenity that is really going on here.  If you've read this far, I trust that you are willing to participate as well.
MY PUBLISHING MODEL
CONTEMPORARY CONTEXT
The world of conventional book production is in tremendous upheaval, (which reflects the condition of our culture as a whole).  With the accessibility of print-on-demand technology, vanity book packagers on every corner, and cheap materials, anyone with a manuscript can become a published author.  Meanwhile, online vendors and E-books have upset the publishing dynasty known as ""The Big Six"", who now struggle to remain afloat by slashing their staff, reducing their offerings, and conspiring to fix E-book prices.
I brought an E-reader with me on my sailing adventure; considering the limitations on luggage, it proved to be an indispensable tool for research and reference during my composition.  Since this may, in fact, be the most sustainable publishing format currently available, I will offer ENTHEOGENESIS as an e-book to whoever desires it, in addition to the physical version made of the paper described above.
THE EXTINCTION OF PRINTED BOOKS?
This possibility is examined in the future history told by my novel; and for my part, I hope that it does not come to pass because I love books.  The sensations of actual pages; the fragrance of glue; the beauty of illustrations; and all of the other ""extras"" elevate writing to something that cannot be matched by text on a screen.  A collection of titles on a server does not conjure the same ambience as someone's hand-picked collection.
If we expect to have printed books in the future, we must be thinking now about how to produce them sustainably; thus will we be able to fill our shelves with volumes of aesthetic appeal, rather than remorse.  My hemp paper, textured as it is with flecks of green and brown vegetation, is beautiful on its own; and my first edition will also include several features I've always enjoyed in other books, such as deckle edge (to accentuate the paper), French flaps (for a more durable and interesting cover) and maps (to ground the story).  To ensure that publications with such features will be available to future generations, I selected my printer based on their reduction of landfill waste; run the offices of beLove on solar energy; and will fuel my nationwide publicity tour with biodiesel (see below for more information).
A NEW PARADIGM
In the space between print-on-demand, electronic publishing, and the faltering ""Big Six"", lies the gap wherein the future of physical books may arise - in the form of small to medium runs from imprints such as my own.  It has been pointed out to me that my readers do not necessary feel the same, or as strongly, about the plight of industrial hemp as I do.  Therefore, the decision to add cost to book production, for a paper that may only console my own sensibilities, is my own responsibility.  True enough; and only as an independent publisher can I realize this luxury.
If I sold my manuscript, I would essentially lose control of my design, pricing, and printing.  Conventional publishers cannot afford to consider an author's ethical values; they make their decisions about book design based on their bottom line, as allegiance to shareholder interests dictates that they must.  Similarly, POD is a system made affordable simply by cookie-cutter design, cheap materials, and gross volume.
The only way to create a book that I can be proud of, while keeping my cover price in the ballpark for my category (15-20 USD), is to produce it myself, and to this end I have formed the beLove imprint.  My strategy is to offset out-of-pocket expenses wherever possible with my own time and energy.  At every step in book production, value (and thus cost) is added.  Through vertical integration, I can absorb some of the fees associated with my specialized book production myself, so that my readers don't have to.
ARTISUNAL ENTERPRISE
It is fortuitous that I am already practiced in the manifestation of this business model.  As a builder of custom homes, I have always involved myself in every detail, from schematic design to the processing of raw materials; from the harvest of the solar energy that powers the tools, to the selection of fixtures based on their lifecycle cost.  The integration of all the trades (by keeping a comprehensive array of services in-house), and the elimination of mark-ups or redundant labor whenever possible, are the means by which my business has consistently delivered exceedingly ecological buildings for prices that are competitive with conventional construction.
My observation is that, in the absence of necessity, people will only voluntarily subscribe to a transitional strategy when it is financially accessible.  As an entrepreneur, I have always sought to increase efficiency and reduce overhead so that I may have the satisfaction of offering a more ecological product (and thus more value) to my clients.  This mode of operation has applied to my work with design, construction, forestry, renewable energy, and agricultural products.  I now intend to bring the same ethics, of conscientious craftsmanship and authentic materials, to my publications.
It's no way to get rich, but that has never been my motivation.  I am motivated by challenges, and by the satisfaction of knowing that I gave my best effort to leave the world a better place than it would be without me.  In this case, there is the challenge of executing the project without losing money - in spite of the fact that my work lacks the guarantee of commercial success sought by the agents who rejected it.  Most of the time though, I feel that there is no ""why""; there is only me, and I am a process by which the will of the Universe is unfolded.
Above all, I know now that I would not have been satisfied with conventional publishing.  I would never have made my publication date, and thus my chance to pay tribute to Terence McKenna; nor would I have been able to use the hemp paper.  Now I get to have both, as well as the ability to create, or creatively collaborate on, all of my own graphics, layout, branding, and publicity.  Instead of squandering my efforts on queries destined for the literary slush pile, all of my work applies directly to the enhancement of my artwork, manuscript, and platform.  The learning curve in publishing very steep, but it is tremendously stimulating, and I'm having a blast overturning the system.

CROWDFUNDING AND DEEP ECONOMY
Although many of my endeavors at Earthaven have been eminently grant-worthy, I have never sought funding from such sources.  To me, the concept of sustainability implies an enterprise that can stand on its own financially; if it is subsidized by the wealth generated in the petroleum economy, then it becomes merely a palliative agent to justify the continuation of our destruction.  Furthermore, I don't have the patience to go through all the administrative waste of applications, grant reports, and so on; and I'm unwilling to compromise my values for the fiscal security of my organizations.  In the grand scheme, government funding and philanthropic contributions are mostly allocated to B.S., if you will; and it is not a funding system to which I will be subservient or that I care to validate.
Thus, the model of innovation that I believe will blaze the trail of our transition is ecological micro-enterprise, wherein the wealth of our future is earned organically.  Such businesses, with their risk/reward component, afford a more dynamic, cutting-edge, and evolutionary approach to our potential extinction than non-profits and such.  Crowdfunding, in turn, offers us all the perfect grassroots mechanism to directly support the endeavors that will in turn become the reality we seek.  As a ""cause"", I love the fact that I can market myself to, and correspond with, my stakeholders directly; and that doing so simultaneously strengthens both my network and platform.
WHAT IF I DON'T REACH MY GOAL?
I will beg, borrow, or otherwise obtain the capital to proceed with the project.  However, any funds contributed to my Indiegogo campaign will afford me opportunity to devote more time to editing/improving my work, and promoting the finished book.
WHAT IF I RECEIVE MORE THAN MY GOAL?
If only I should be so fortunate ; )
First of all, I will cover the costs of fulfilling the perks I've offered.  Each dollar contributed does not translate to a dollar applied toward the paper, since, with each perk, I incur costs that are additional to the expenses of publishing (such as shipping, travel, merchandise, etc.)  At some point in the realm of $20-25K, I expect that I will be able to pay for both the perks AND the paper.  If I don't reach that point, I will pursue other sources of funding as necessary to make up the difference.
After the perks and paper are paid for, surplus funds will be used to increase the size of my initial printing if possible.  This will reduce my upfront cost per copy, and thus the cover price.  Also, contributions above and beyond my goal provide me working capital to increase the scope of my book publicity tour, reprint ENTHEOGENESIS sooner, expand my line of hemp merchandise, andor begin composition of the sequel/prequel sooner.
MY EDITOR:
By starting my own imprint, I committed myself to (among other things) the responsibility of hiring my own editor.  With any literary connections to speak of, I hardly knew where to begin this process; but I had a specific ""fit"" in mind, and sought a relationship that would transcend marks on a page.  After an epic investigation, I had the exceedingly good fortune of encountering the illustrious Patrick Lobrutto at a moment conjunct with an opening in his schedule.
He has stewarded works of several authors that influenced me (such as Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, Philip K. Dick, etc.), and as editor of the ""Dune"" novels, is intimately familiar with the demands of constructing an imaginary alternate universe.  This is an important factor since I hope to work with the same editor on the other books in my series; someone who will, as Patrick put it, know my world better than anyone other than myself, in the end.  Thanks to his direct experience of the counterculture and psychedelic experience, he is perfectly positioned to understand what I aim to accomplish in the broader world with my work.  He is a legend among editors (how many have a Wikipedia page, after all?), with thirty-five years experience, who won the World Fantasy Award for editing.  Frankly, I was thrilled just to speak with him on the phone, let alone to have the once-in-a-lifetime chance to retain his services - which I did because we both agreed unequivocally that he is best editor money can buy for my project.
But what Pat brings to the table is much more than just expertise and prestige.  He offers a holistic view of the cosmos, a comprehensive understanding of the entire publishing industry, and the wisdom necessary to polish my raw vision into something worthy of publication (and thus, of your reading time).  I expect his knowledge of history, philosophy, mythology, and literature to improve my novel immensely; but his influence on the project extends to the cover design and publicity advice as well, and I am so honored to have him on my team.
SCHEDULE AND TOUR:
The launch of my campaign is conjunct with the transit of Venus, the last event of its kind for over a century, whose auspiciious significance I aim to harness for my success.  Immediately afterwards, I travel north to meet Pat LoBrutto in person, and revisit geographic points of interests from the story.  Our editing process will continue for the 9-week duration my campaign.  Its conclusion on August 7th coincides with my 27th birthday.
August 7th is also Lammas, the cross-quarter date between the solstice and equinox.  As such, I will be through 5/8ths of the year I have afforded this project; and at this point, I will have galley copies of my novel produced to send to reviewers.
The actual book production will occur as soon after the galleys as possible, pending a final edit and delivery of the hemp/recycled paper to my printer.  I will have physical books for distribution to my Indiegogo contributors by the first week of November.  The distribution that I have in place should permit me to place books in stores by 12.21.12; but retail booksellers make their orders so far in advance of the Christmas season that the only way to secure your copy is to pre-order one here, or purchase one from me directly at one of my tour locations.
Although the details are still coalescing, I can say for now that I intend to be on a publicity tour in a biodiesel-powered Toyota Previa for the end of 2012, and much of 2013; points of interest include:
10/30 - Asheville, NC

YOUR SUPPORT:
I hope that you'll spend a few moments browsing my perks, and that one (or more) might catch your fancy.  Regardless, there are also many ways you can contribute that don't necessarily involve spending US dollars.  In order to succeed, my campaign must achieve virality; if you tell other people about it, and they tell others, I can raise awareness by exponential growth and guerilla marketing, where the promotion of my project is based on its own merit, instead of conventional advertising machinations.
To help, you can recommend/forward my project to your family and co-workers; post a link to it on your blog; promote it on your Twitter account or share it on your Facebook wall and invite friends.  Send me your criticism or appreciation; offer to set up a book signing near you; get me an introduction or some coverage in the press.
Above all, I aim to advance our aspirations toward sustainability and cultural transition; selling my books is but one vehicle for the purpose.  I'm always interested in meeting dynamic people and exploring endeavors that go outside the box, if you care to share with me your ideas for advancing our collective cause.  And please don't hesitate to contact me about barter, non-monetary contributions, or any questions for might have about my campaign.
I look forward to thanking you at the finish line!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>My name is William Matson. I am the writer of the acclaimed book ""Crazy Horse: The Lakota Warrior's Life and Legacy"" which was written with Crazy Horse family members Floyd Clown, Doug War Eagle, and Don Red Thunder based on the family's oral history. I am also an award winning documentary film maker.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong><i>My journey has been an extraordinary one. My father had his basic training during World War II at Camp Stoneman in Pittsburg, California. It was run by the 7th Cavalry, the unit commanded by Lt Col George Armstrong Custer during the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876. During his training there his drill sergeant asked him who won the Battle of the Little Bighorn. When he said the Natives did he was punished. The punishment was so severe that he vowed to write a book someday from the Native side of the Battle. But life got in the way. At 71 years of age he was diagnosed with lymphoma. On his deathbed in 1998 he asked me to finish his mission. It was his dying wish. I couldn't say no. In 2001 while attempting to carry out his wish, he spoke to me from the other side at a place called Bear Butte. He told me to learn Lakota spiritual and cultural ways. So I read the books about their spirituality and culture. When I came back to Bear Butte in 2002, I met with the Head Ranger Jim Jandreau who gave me the phone number of a Crazy Horse family member named Doug War Eagle. The Crazy Horse family had taken a vow of silence for over a century not to tell anyone who they were. Thus the true story of Crazy Horse from his family was hidden all that time. This book is about the journey to meet and coming to a mutual trust with the Crazy Horse family members. This book is about a journey no one else in the world has ever been on and probably will never be another one like it. This story is one of a kind.</i></strong></p></li>
<li><strong>While with members of the Clown family on our “Crazy Horse the Lakota Warrior’s Life and Legacy” book tour, we broke a lot of ground. We saw around 10,000 people during our tour. We saw their hunger to learn about the Lakota ways. To have a deeper understanding of their history. This book digs deeper into understanding the Lakota ways through the eyes of someone who was not raised a Lakota and knew very little about their ways until I met them. I spent eighteen years in close contact with the Clown family. Hopefully this will help those unfamiliar with Lakota spirituality learn it as I learned it. Through eyes that knew nothing and were suspicious at first until I learned the truth of their ways. I also write how their oral history was verified. My goal is to promote the understanding of their culture. For people to realize that the Lakota have more to contribute to the world, then the world previously knew about. I told it from my heart because that is where my journey was centered.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>To publish ""In My Father's Footsteps"" there are several steps. A Manuscript Edit is required to insure that everything I have written is easily readable, understood and the spelling is spot on. I will be working with Mary Neighbours on that and her fee is $700. The paperback book will have to be formatted. If it is just words it will be about $200, if it includes photos the price will jump depending on whether they are black and white or color. Most of the original photos are color but can be made to be black and white. With photos the formatting will be about $240 for black and white or color. Cover design runs $1000-$1500. Printing costs for 1000 books for black and white will cost about $4170. If we go with the color photos it is nearly double that at $8000.  So total cost for black and white is about $6500. If we are fortunate enough to raise more than color is $11250. Reward costs and fees to Indiegogo are estimated at around $1000.  So the minimum to get 1000 physical paperbacks is $7500. For color it is $13,500. </li>
<li><strong>It's a chance to get William Matson's follow up book to ""Crazy Horse The Lakota Warrior's Life and Legacy"" right off the press and also autographed by Matson at a reduced price from retail. If you haven't gotten a copy of ""Crazy Horse the Lakota Warrior's Life and Legacy"" it is a chance to finally pick it up. Also the 4 part series ""The Authorized Biography of Crazy Horse and His Family"" and the DVD ""Journey of the Heart"" is available for those who want to see where the family's oral history happened. You can also talk to Matson by phone for 30 minutes on his experiences he wrote about in his book. There are three opportunities available within the first pages of the book for your name or the name of a loved one to be printed in every book that comes off the press. It will be under a heading reading: ""<i>The following are the People most responsible for publishing this book"". </i>A single person may donate to get all three slots or even two slots or just a single slot. There will be no slots added later.</strong></li>
<li>We are hope and pray that we reach our goal to print our book. But if we fall short of our goal, we will still print to order. In the case of the DVDs and ""Crazy Horse the Lakota Warrior's Life and Legacy"" rewards, they are already pressed and will be sent out. If we fail to reach our goal to get 1000 copies we will have to have them printed one at a time and impractical to plan any book tours or to get it on any book store shelves, It will also extend the waiting time if someone ordered a copy of the ""In My Father's Footsteps""not to mention the retail price will have to increase substantially just to get it printed after the crowdfunding.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li><i><strong>Learning a culture you did not grow up with is not as easy. We have built in prejudices that most of us aren't even aware of. I was not a very spiritual person when I started this journey and so when my deceased father spoke to me three years after he died and when Crazy Horse's long dead father rose out of the rocks of a sweat lodge, I was both excited and confused,,,until I found the deeper meaning of why it happened, spiritually, culturally, and intellectually. I will now have a chance to tell a story that is old, yet very new to many. To tell what I learned in my 18 years of deep friendship with the Crazy Horse family and other Lakota elders that I was fortunate enough to go on this journey with. I believe if the many cultures of the world can understand each other rather than compete than we're on our way to a better and more peaceful world. A world richer in knowledge and life. A world with less misunderstandings.</strong></i></li>
<li><strong>This is the second book I have written. The first I wrote ""Crazy Horse the Lakota Warrior's Life and Legacy"", we met at least 10,000 people at 317 book talks in the US and Europe. We were very well received. The family communicated much about the Lakota culture and spirituality that most people did not know. They learned through the eyes of the Crazy Horse family what it was like to be part of that family for the past two centuries. I got to stand with them and tell what I saw.</strong></li>
<li><i>I told ""In My Father's Footsteps"" from my heart. It is the only way I know how to write. Anyone who has read ""Crazy Horse the Lakota Warrior's Life and Legacy"" is familiar with my style. I wrote t""In My Father's Footsteps"" with the same painstaking and completely honest approach. I would be robbing the reader, the people I write about, and myself if I did it any other way.</i></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Although I have already one published book, the publishing was taken care of by a professional publisher. ""In My Father's Footsteps"" is written. This is the first time I have self-published. So each step in this process its a new adventure. </p>
<ul>
<li>I an employing Mary Neighbours, an experienced self publishing professional, to help me through the process. I will persevere until I get everything done professionally and right.</li>
<li>I will follow hers and any other hired professional's advice religiously. I plan on using Ingram Spark to print the books. Ingram Spark is owned by the Ingram book distribution network, the most recognized and largest book distribution network in the world.</li>

We were very well received. The family communicated much about the Lakota culture and spirituality that most people did not know. They learned through the eyes of the Crazy Horse family what it was like to be part of that family for the past two centuries. I got to stand with them and tell what I saw.
I told ""In My Father's Footsteps"" from my heart. It is the only way I know how to write. Anyone who has read ""Crazy Horse the Lakota Warrior's Life and Legacy"" is familiar with my style. I wrote t""In My Father's Footsteps"" with the same painstaking and completely honest approach. I would be robbing the reader, the people I write about, and myself if I did it any other way.


Risks & Challenges
Although I have already one published book, the publishing was taken care of by a professional publisher. ""In My Father's Footsteps"" is written. This is the first time I have self-published. So each step in this process its a new adventure. 

I an employing Mary Neighbours, an experienced self publishing professional, to help me through the process. I will persevere until I get everything done professionally and right.
I will follow hers and any other hired professional's advice religiously. I plan on using Ingram Spark to print the books. Ingram Spark is owned by the Ingram book distribution network, the most recognized and largest book distribution network in the world.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are Hercules Editions, a small London-based press founded in 2012 with the vision of bringing together poetry and original visual responses.</p>
<p>Our latest project is an exciting new chapbook from poet, translator and critic Martyn Crucefix.</p>
<p>In <i>Cargo of Limbs</i>, a modern re-imagining of Book Six of Virgil's <i>Aeneid</i>, two Western journalists document – in their contrasting ways – the ordeal of Syrian migrants fleeing war and persecution, trying to cross the Mediterranean in search of safety in contemporary Europe.</p>
<p>The tone and narrative of this new work – as in the original – is dream-like and nightmarish. As their journey unfolds, the journalists and those they travel with approach a shoreline. But this is not the River Styx; it is the inhospitable edge of the Mediterranean and the ferryman’s boats – ""the black dinghy squeals / the leaking boat groans"" – seem to promise danger more than escape.</p>
<p>Dan O’Brien, US poet, playwright and author of <i>War Reporter</i>, writes: ""Martyn Crucefix knows in his bones that “what / happens is what’s true” and his liquid, propulsive poem records, like the accompanying photographs by Syrian artist Amel Alzakout, the horrible adventure of survival. <i>Cargo of Limbs</i> sees or struggles to see; it is a lament and a rebuke, a concise saga of our savage time"".</p>
<p>Amel Alzakout captured the photographs that accompany the book on a camera strapped to her wrist as she was fleeing Syria. During the crossing, the boat she was travelling on capsized; she was extremely fortunate to survive. Amel's images appeared in Richard Mosse's film <i>Incoming</i>, part of Forensic Architecture's Turner Prize-shortlisted investigation of the incident; they will also form the basis of the upcoming film <i>Purple Sea</i>. </p>
<p>The book also includes an essay on the current migration crisis by the Kurdish poet Choman Hardi, and an essay on the process of writing the poem by the author. <br/> </p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Quality Time Left</i> is an exploration of life’s third act. It explores the opportunities and pitfalls that drive a healthier, engaging, and connected retirement. <br/><br/>My name is Curtis Bailey and I am the author of <i>Quality Time Left</i>. I wrote this book because I have seen the importance of planning for retirement beyond someone’s financials. It’s about taking control over your time remaining to pursue the things most important to you.<br/><br/>My hope is that this book will help you discover small changes that can have a huge impact on how you spend your time. It’ll help show you how retirement can be dynamic and joyful. It builds on the foundation of a great career. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool for ideas to consider for building a quality life with our time remaining. <br/><br/>In this book, you’ll learn about rest ethic and healthspan. You’ll hear stories about how real retirees achieved, struggled, and became seemingly entirely new people. There is a couple that went from being corporate executives to running a farm. Instead of retiring quietly in the suburbs, they decided to cultivate a new self-image and foster memories for their grandkid; helping out with the livestock and in the fields. <br/><br/>You’ll love this book if you want to learn from retirees and retirement experts about the key drivers for a more content retirement. <br/><br/>Quality Time Left is a nonfiction book that speaks to retirees and people within five years of retirement who want to look at retirement in a new way. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Book - <i>Quality Time Left</i>
</h3>The book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 is about Healthspan. These chapters discuss food, movement, and recovery. It helps explain how to help fight off chronic disease, be independent longer, and feel generally happier. It all starts with these small daily decisions that allow us to live the life we want. <br/><br/>Part 2 is about Relationships. Across these chapters, we explore family, friendship, and helping others. Loss and loneliness are challenges that retirees face if they don’t have and cultivate a strong support system. The vast majority of work connections fizzle away, yet with a more open schedule comes the opportunity to reconnect with old friends and develop better connections. <br/><br/>Part 3 is about Engagement. There is a huge shift in identity around retirement. One of the first questions we’re often asked is “what do you do?” This part delves into continuous learning, staying engaged, and nurturing your tribe. For some, this means a new entrepreneurial venture. Others, finally find the time to dedicate their skillset to charities they love. <br/><br/> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs of publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>

<strong>The Layout Design</strong> for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).</li>
<li>
<strong>The Copyediting</strong> for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication. If you know me, this requires a real professional. </li>
<li>
<strong>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts</strong> for my book when I ultimately publish this Winter.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who <strong>pre-order my book now</strong>:</p>

nuestros productos en la Galería Multimedia.Nos apasiona poder utilizar diversas plataformas para llevar a nuestros
lectores mexicanos publicaciones de la más alta calidad.  Es con este afán que tomamos la decisión de
crear una revista sobre el diseño, la creatividad y la cultura sofisticada de
México.Que mejor manera para lograr esto que habernos asociados con la reconocida Martha

About the Project


For the last three years photographer Joel Austin has been taking pictures in the Penokee Hills of northern Wisconsin. We are now in the process of pulling together his images of this wild and beautiful place together into a book. Many people have not heard of the Penokees, but now they are in the spotlight as the site of a huge proposed open pit iron mine. If the mine were to be allowed to operate, it would be the one of the largest in the world at 22 miles long, about 1/2 mile wide and nearly 1000 feet deep -- all in the Bad River Watershed, with its wild rivers, valuable wetlands, and local communities including the Bad River Indian Reservation. It all eventually empties into Lake Superior; as Joel points out: “The quality of Lake Superior’s water is determined by activities in the watershed.""


About the book
Discovering the Penokees will be mostly pictures but will also feature a fair amount of text on potential impacts of a mine: economic, environmental, and human health effects (which will be especially hard on the Bad River Indian Reservation). We are planning a 10x8 (horizontal) softcover book of 160 pages, and possibly also an e-book. The book will also include a map of the region and other references. Projected availability is December 2013.

Our Team and Goals  

Along with Joel and others contributing to this book, Sweetwater Visions is committed to this project. While the funds raised by Indiegogo will go directly towards producing and marketing this book, the profits from sale of the book will be used to work with others to fight this mine—to leave open other future possibilities for developing a sustainable economy, to preserve this landscape for future generations so they are able to stay, work and play here.



Stretch Goals

Our budget will change depending on funds raised with Indiegogo and we will allow for our project to evolve and change as it nears completion, depending on our available budget. Our goal of $3,000 is the very minimum that we need to get this project off the ground, but if we can raise $6,000 or more, we can do an offset press print run, which lowers the cost per book and thus increases the amount that can go to the cause. 


Positive Message

Joel wants the book to be positive: “We will cover some negative impacts of mining, but what I want to focus on is what an incredibly beautiful area this is — an area that, although I was born in Wisconsin, and have lived 33 of my 34 years in the state, I hadn't even heard of until a few years ago. My guess is that not many people do know about the beauty of the Penokees. And that's a big reason why I want to do this: to let people know what an incredible resource we have in the Penokees, and maybe to even question the wisdom of mining it — steer them towards thinking that maybe the value of the Penokees isn't what we can get at by blasting them and hauling part of them away.”  Instead of just thinking in terms of fighting against something the book will give reasons why we should fight for things like sustainability, beauty, and health.

Reasons your contribution will make this happen:

The pictures are already taken. We're not starting from scratch. Austin is an award winning photographer and has been previously published in places like Lake Superior Magazine.

The book design and layout is nearly finished. 
Sweetwater Visions is an experienced small publisher, having published an award-winning photographic book on Lake Superior and several Great Lakes videos. 
Sweetwater Visions’ experienced editor is already working on the book.
All of the people working on this book are willing to work on the tight budget that a project like this requires because they believe in the cause.


But we now need your financial help to make this book a reality.

In 66 years of war we could not achieve any permanent solution - we believe that it's time to try a different path. On the Peace Bus we promote principles of tolerance, understanding and non-violence. People of all religions, colors, nations, gender come together in the loving attitude to see what the media is trying to hide away from us – a true face of the so called ""enemy"".

We are all human beings who happened to be raised as enemies. And this is a real tragedy. We can not live in Peace as long as other side is suffering. Therefore, the PEACE IS OUR COMMON GOAL!

On our journey we visited the Hand in Hand organization, which runs Jewish-Arabic joint schools in Yaffo, Tel Aviv and Haifa, spoke with the Circle of Israeli-Palestinian Bereaved Families and  members of Kol Aher (The Other Voice) families for peace, who live in the South of Israel, at the border of Gaza. This was one  of the most remarkable journeys of the Peace Bus. We collected 32 boxes on our way and received around 7000 NIS on our donation account, of      
which we have spent by now 5000 NIS already on supplies 
for Gaza in agreement with the Caritas international health relief organisation, our partner for peace.
We will keep doing our job and dedicated this week for buying donations for civilians in Gaza. Therefore, the next bus will take place in two weeks, on Friday, 22.08. This way we can save our energy and money and focus this week entirely on collections. We continue collecting donations for Gaza also in the future and thank you for all already done contributions.

<p>Hello everyone !</p>
<p>The project is called “Freediving Physiology Book”.</p>
<p>I am asking you to support the translation of this book, dedicated entirely to freediving, and called: ""Apnea, from theory to practice"", from French into English.</p>
<p>The French version was published in 2007 and updated in 2015. The first edition that I coordinated was very successful. The book has become a must-read with those who want to deepen their knowledge. The French version was supported by an association (APRAAS), to create a special grant for students working on the physiology of breath-holding. Unfortunately, at the moment, there is no thorough book on breath-holding physiology available in the world.</p>
<p>This 458-page book (in French) deals with the historical, physiological, pathological, psychological and practical aspects of freediving. ""Apnea, from theory to practice"" is therefore intended for all those who are interested in this field: confirmed or beginner freedivers looking for documentation, future freediving or spearfishing instructors, coaches and doctors in charge of sport groups.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>Who am I?</i></strong></p>
<p>My name is Frédéric Lemaître, I am an Assistant Professor of Physiology, specialized in freediving physiology, and have already published over 50 international scientific papers.

</div></div>","Hello everyone !
The project is called “Freediving Physiology Book”.
I am asking you to support the translation of this book, dedicated entirely to freediving, and called: ""Apnea, from theory to practice"", from French into English.
The French version was published in 2007 and updated in 2015. The first edition that I coordinated was very successful. The book has become a must-read with those who want to deepen their knowledge. The French version was supported by an association (APRAAS), to create a special grant for students working on the physiology of breath-holding. Unfortunately, at the moment, there is no thorough book on breath-holding physiology available in the world.
This 458-page book (in French) deals with the historical, physiological, pathological, psychological and practical aspects of freediving. ""Apnea, from theory to practice"" is therefore intended for all those who are interested in this field: confirmed or beginner freedivers looking for documentation, future freediving or spearfishing instructors, coaches and doctors in charge of sport groups.
Who am I?
My name is Frédéric Lemaître, I am an Assistant Professor of Physiology, specialized in freediving physiology, and have already published over 50 international scientific papers. I have worked with several famous freedivers such as Stéphane Mifsud, Pierre Frolla, Guillaume Néry and Morgan Bourc’his in France, and am still working with other well-known deep freedivers! I was a member of AIDA France and am currently a member of the AIDA International medical board.
I am also a passionate freediver, have been an Instructor (French Federation FFESSM and AIDA) for over 20 years, and was captain for the French team between 2009 and 2012 for several World Championships.

 
Who supports this project?
The University of Normandy (IRIHS), Rouen and Le Havre University Press (PURH), and the Faculty of Sport Sciences and its Research Laboratory CETAPS have already brought financial backing to this project, which enabled the translation of the first 165 pages (1950 euros)!
Rouen and Le Havre University Press have already committed to publishing the English version in 2018, once it is ready to be released on the market.

<h3>A Little Bit About Us</h3>
<p>We, Liana Hall and Alicia Wanklyn, are the team behind The Little Cottage illustrated book. </p>
<p>Liana, the author, is an actress, writer and occasional attorney. She studied at Sevenoaks School and University College London in the UK before heading back across the pond. For the last seven years she has split her time between Bermuda and the United States working both in government and in the arts. Visit <a href=""http://www.lianahall.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.lianahall.com</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Alicia, the illustrator, is an artist, fashion designer, photographer and photo editor. She has studied in Canada at University of Guelph and Nova Scotia College of Art and Design. Bermuda has always been integral to Alicia's artistic vision and she is proud to call it home. </p>
<p>Alicia and Liana have known each other since they attended Bermuda High School as youngsters. Liana remembers Alicia's love for tuna fish sandwiches and Alicia remembers Liana's excitement at attending her birthday party. They have collaborated many times together, including being featured in Caribbean magazine Island Life. The time for the next step in their journey together has arrived. <br/><br/></p>
<h3>A Little Bit About The Little Cottage</h3>
<p>""On the islands of Bermuda in the parish of Sandys there is a very Little Cottage right next to the very littlest drawbridge in the world. The Little Cottage has a white roof, just like all Bermuda houses, and a turquoise body that perfectly matches the colour of the ocean that flows past its very little dock. On that very little dock is a very little petrol station servicing the boats and cars that pull into refuel, admiring the view as they come."" - The Little Cottage</p>
<div>The Little Cottage is a picture book primarily aimed at children, but with art that will enthrall adults. It is intended to be a lasting piece of cultural art for Bermuda in the vein of The Giving Tree, The Little Prince and Roald Dahl and Quentin Blake's partnership. A book that will remain treasured by children as they grow into adulthood. </div>
<p>This book will initially be published locally in a limited run and then pitched to international agents and publishers. It is hoped that the success of this book will assist in bringing attention to our little island home. </p>
<p>You can help us bring these dreams to life. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Cultural &amp; Charitable Impact</h3>
<p>The Little Cottage contains historical and cultural facts about the island. It is hoped this will educate local and international children alike. </p>
<p>For this initial run, proceeds of the book's profits will go to local charities. Those charities, chosen by the author and illustrator, are Friends of Hospice, The Bermuda National Trust and The Chewstick Foundation. </p>
<p>There will also be 20 limited edition, handbound books created on heavy-stock, imprinted paper that will be made by Wythern Publishing in London. Ten of these books will go to the highest donors and the other 10 will be auctioned off for these charities at the launch party. Donors and bidders alike will be comfortable in the knowledge that this will be a limited run of first edition, enduring art. </p>
<h3>Giving &amp; Gifts</h3>
<p>Although $15,000 seems like a hefty amount, it's actually less than we need, but as indiegogo charges more if you don't reach your goal, we're trying to be realistic. We're aiming for a very high-quality product and your funds will go towards the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Art Materials</li>
<li>Photoshop and other Adobe software</li>
<li>HD Scanner</li>
<li>Use of Bermuda professional printing services</li>
<li>Manuscript printing for review</li>
<li>Spec books to send to agents and publishers</li>
<li>Set up fee and construction of 20 handbound leather books by Wythern Binding</li>
<li>Initial run of as many illustrated books as we can afford (200+)</li>
<li>Incentive gifts</li>
<li>Secured international submission mailing to agents and publishers</li>
<li>External Hard Drives</li>
<li>Art Space</li>
<li>Customs on the finished product</li>
<li>And everything else publishing entails!</li>
</ul>
<p>As for what YOU get for contributing to the project, there are lots of fun gifts that we're providing. You can see the full details to the right, but they include Little Cottage greeting cards, launch party tickets, signed prints, silk scarves and throw pillows, colouring books and much more. Choose whatever package works the best for you. No amount is too little. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone can help financially, but if you still want to support the campaign we'd love it if you shared our page and helped spread the word! There are sharing tools right on Indiegogo, so Facebook update, tweet, instagram and whatever else you crazy kids do. </p>

Hello,
 
My name is Justin Stewart. I'm a writer/musician from North Carolina. If I'm not on stage or in the studio you'd better believe I'm probably writing.
 
In fact, writing was one of my first loves before music. I've written everything from poetry, to short stories, even some small times articles online. But it was always a dream of mine to finally put this series I've been concocting for years into print.
 
This campaign means so much to me. As a first-time, self-publisher I lack the funds and resources to really give this novel that I've poured my heart and soul into a fighting chance. I'm a 26 year old bass player who married a beautiful woman with three wonderful kids and they want this book to be a success as much as I, if not more so (it's not easy being married to a dreamer (me)).
 
If you donate to this campaign you will be doing more than making an already happy man's biggest wish come true but you'll be helping lots of children in the process as well.
 
How?
 
When I was younger, I did in fact have a very trying childhood and was brought up in some of the roughest parts of town. There wasn't a huge emphasis on reading and writing in that type of environment. But, I still found a library. There was always one nearby. That's why a portion of all the books I print will go to local libraries and schools so that kids have a little more to choose from and a lot more magic to believe in.
 
WHERES THE MONEY GOING?
 
My goal is 20,000 dollars. Truth be told, that is no small amount. But rest assured, it is all necessary. Here is a breakdown of where the dollars go.
 

-Printing physical copies
-Paying an editor to make the book print worthy
-Graphic Artist
-And advertising
 
WHAT ARE THE PERKS?
 
Every dollar you donate is another brick in the 'Guardian of the Stones' foundation. You are helping me bring a new world to readers all around the world. A world I invite you to be a part of.
 
The amount you donate to this campaign will determine your power and status among the population of my novel.

<p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Welcome to my world, Crystal Shade.</b> My name is Istvan Szabo, Ifj, and I live in Budapest, Hungary. I’m an author and graphic artist, an award-winning screenwriter and director, and the one-man team behind this project. As such, I am responsible for the writing and development, concept art, illustrations, trailers and animation and everything else in a bid to make this book series known and successful.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Crystal Shade series is my passion and life’s work thus far. I have written this series with the aim of telling a unique story in a new, strange fantasy world. The first volume, Crystal Shade: Angeni, Volume 1, which was released on November 11, 2011, has already made her first step towards becoming a story to remember; a world and a tale you can’t compare to anything else. Volume 1 tells the tale of Grace, a young daydreamer who wants to be a guardian angel with all of its nobility, but, in typical child-like fashion she does not consider the downside. The story follows the dream of this little girl to become a guardian who lives so that others might live, so she can learn the truth behind the legendary mythological event of the Crystal Shade, which everyone respects and fears. As Grace's desire gradually comes true, she is faced with the reality that sometimes the sweetest dream is actually a nightmare waiting to unfold. In the story there are myths and secrets, mysteries and revelations, peace and menace, big dreams to fulfill and things to learn from failure, life, death and glorious returns – it’s all there in the first book, lovingly written by me and loved by many. While Volume 1 reveals how a fairy tale can come true, the sequel will show how dark it can become.<br/></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Here’s where you come in!</b> I'm seeking your help to unfold the rest of the story, so we may continue the journey together and release the sequels of Crystal Shade, of which there are two. <b>Crystal Shade: Angeni, Volume 2</b> deals with the madness between light and dark, covering everything I ever wanted to do with the original storyline, and maybe more. The third book is the prelude story, <b>Crystal Shade: Afterlight</b>, which intends to connect the two volumes in a strange, poetic and twisted way, telling of the nightmares an angel may experience.<br/></p><h3><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/201443/files/20131116054346-Daydreamer_Dreaming.jpg?1384609426"" src="""" style=""""/></b></h3><h3><b><b><h3><b>Why am I fundraising?</b></h3></b></b></h3><p></p><p><i><b>If a legend falls silent, who will tell the children our dreams?</b> </i>With your help the legend of Crystal Shade will continue in 2014. In order to achieve a proper release, I need to raise <b>$15,000*</b> for the following:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>to hire a professional editor for Crystal Shade: Afterlight and Crystal Shade: Angeni, Volume 2 (~$3000)<br/>
</li>
<li>to publish, distribute and market them worldwide. (~$4000)<br/>
</li>
<li>and to hire a professional publicist to help me reach the right audience. (~$4000)<br/>
</li>
</ul><p></p><p> <b>*</b>The target goal includes the 4% IndieGogo and the 3-5% PayPal service fees, and the Hungarian taxes.<br/></p><p>To learn more about Crystal Shade, please read <b>Crystal Shade: Introduction</b>,
 a free 64-page long, exclusive release of five short, spoiler-free 
introductory chapters, presenting the world and development of the 
series. You can also read a full chapter of the first volume. Other 
extras, including art, images and real-life certificates, are included.

What Auralight Fantasy is?</b></b></h3><p style=""text-align: justify;""><i><b>Crystal Shade is for everyone who lives to dream and dreams to live.</b></i> It is neither a religious nor mainstream angel series, but a timeless story for all ages which explores our souls and the deepest secrets of our dreams. Crystal Shade is an <b>Auralight Fantasy</b> (a.k.a. AuraFantasy or Auralight) which is a new variation on and mix of many genres. While it contains many elements of Epic Fantasy and Young Adult books, along with others from Science Fiction and Steampunk, such as aura-powered flying and other machines and weapons, or a strange world with a blue sun, it also includes various biological-fantastical elements, such as aura beings with superpowers living in the different spirit realms of an otherworldly ancient society. The atmosphere is not just felt, but seen to emanate from the people, places and other living and non-living things. The term Auralight Fantasy was coined to reflect the more overtly fantastical tones of Crystal Shade. While angels and demons play key roles, the series tries to present these mythical and mysterious creatures in a fresh way and to make their characterization less rigid. Because angels, demons, spirits and other religious creatures can sometimes alienate readers, I present them in such a way that everyone can read and enjoy them, regardless of their age, gender, origin or beliefs.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/218057/files/20131123072547-So_Others_May_Live.jpg?1385220347"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p><p></p><h3>
<b>How
long the sequels will be?</b>
</h3><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Crystal Shade: Angeni, Volume 2</b>, will have nine long chapters, written in the story-within-a-story format and style that I used in the first volume. Prior to the very last rewrite, Volume 2 was approximately <b>180,000 words</b> long (Volume 1 was roughly 148,000). <b>Crystal Shade: Afterlight</b> involves a different type of storytelling and will number about <b>5,000 words</b>.<b><span><br/></span></b></p><h3>
<b><span>When will the sequels be published? </span></b>
</h3><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span></span>My goal is to have the prequel short story, <b>Crystal Shade: Afterlight</b> professionally edited and published by <b>July 7, 2014</b>, the digital edition of <b>Crystal Shade: Angeni, Volume 2</b> by <b>November 11, 2014</b> (the franchise's third birthday), and the paperback by January 15, 2015. In order to accomplish all that, with high-quality releases, worldwide marketing and distribution, I am looking for a few angelic sponsors.<span></span></p><p></p><p></p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/201441/files/20131116054312-Revelation.jpg?1384609392"" src="""" style=""""/></h3><h3>Some reviews that made me happy; <br/>

writer's skill and the originality of the story. One of the few books I've read
where you won't feel you have anything to compare it to.""</i></b></p><p style=""text-align: right;"">Barnes and Noble Review</p><p align=""justify""><b><i>“I just can't get over how beautiful the language is in this book, it
sets the tone of this otherworldly society so well. It's familiar and yet
foreign. That right there takes a great deal of talent. The imagery that's
described is just breathtaking. I was a bit worried it would put a lot of
religious aspects out there. I was very wrong, and should have jumped on this
as soon as I got it.”</i></b></p><p style=""text-align: right;"">Kana, Goodreads Review</p><p align=""justify""><b><i>""This book is a change from everything I've read recently. The story
itself unfolds more gently, the action moving at a slower pace most of the
time. The writing is beautiful. Elegant, even.""</i></b></p><p style=""text-align: right;"">Rebecca

refreshing these days! Crystal Shade is beautifully written with an almost
historical feel to the book. The writing style is, in my opinion, more complex
than other YA writers I have read.""</i> </b></p><p style=""text-align: right;"">Amy, Following the Reader</p>
<p align=""justify""><b><i>“Reading Crystal Shade was both an adventure into a complex world of
angels and a thoughtful beautifully written work of art. Seldom do I find a
young adult novel with both a good story which will capture the hearts of its
readers presented with language that will challenge and entrance the reader.
This author has done both. In fact I was so captivated by the story I read it
three times.”</i> </b></p><p style=""text-align: right;"">Karen Doering, Parent’s Little Black Book</p>
<p align=""justify""><b><i>“This was such an interesting story concept for me, I remember when I
received the book for review, and I remember thinking to myself how is a story
being told by a seven year old going to work. I mean even in the YA genre seven
is a little young, I wondered if I was going to be able to identify with the
character, and for me as a reader I need to be able to identify with the
characters in the book. But the book is really so much more than I thought it
was going to be.""</i></b></p><p style=""text-align: right;"">Kathryn S.

<p></p></div>","Dear Reader,
Welcome to my world, Crystal Shade. My name is Istvan Szabo, Ifj, and I live in Budapest, Hungary. I’m an author and graphic artist, an award-winning screenwriter and director, and the one-man team behind this project. As such, I am responsible for the writing and development, concept art, illustrations, trailers and animation and everything else in a bid to make this book series known and successful.The Crystal Shade series is my passion and life’s work thus far. I have written this series with the aim of telling a unique story in a new, strange fantasy world. The first volume, Crystal Shade: Angeni, Volume 1, which was released on November 11, 2011, has already made her first step towards becoming a story to remember; a world and a tale you can’t compare to anything else. Volume 1 tells the tale of Grace, a young daydreamer who wants to be a guardian angel with all of its nobility, but, in typical child-like fashion she does not consider the downside. The story follows the dream of this little girl to become a guardian who lives so that others might live, so she can learn the truth behind the legendary mythological event of the Crystal Shade, which everyone respects and fears. As Grace's desire gradually comes true, she is faced with the reality that sometimes the sweetest dream is actually a nightmare waiting to unfold. In the story there are myths and secrets, mysteries and revelations, peace and menace, big dreams to fulfill and things to learn from failure, life, death and glorious returns – it’s all there in the first book, lovingly written by me and loved by many. While Volume 1 reveals how a fairy tale can come true, the sequel will show how dark it can become.Here’s where you come in! I'm seeking your help to unfold the rest of the story, so we may continue the journey together and release the sequels of Crystal Shade, of which there are two. Crystal Shade: Angeni, Volume 2 deals with the madness between light and dark, covering everything I ever wanted to do with the original storyline, and maybe more. The third book is the prelude story, Crystal Shade: Afterlight, which intends to connect the two volumes in a strange, poetic and twisted way, telling of the nightmares an angel may experience.Why am I fundraising?If a legend falls silent, who will tell the children our dreams? With your help the legend of Crystal Shade will continue in 2014. In order to achieve a proper release, I need to raise $15,000* for the following:
to hire a professional editor for Crystal Shade: Afterlight and Crystal Shade: Angeni, Volume 2 (~$3000)

to publish, distribute and market them worldwide. (~$4000)

and to hire a professional publicist to help me reach the right audience. (~$4000)

 *The target goal includes the 4% IndieGogo and the 3-5% PayPal service fees, and the Hungarian taxes.To learn more about Crystal Shade, please read Crystal Shade: Introduction,
 a free 64-page long, exclusive release of five short, spoiler-free 
introductory chapters, presenting the world and development of the 
series. You can also read a full chapter of the first volume. Other 
extras, including art, images and real-life certificates, are included. 
Click HERE to open the Introductory PDF. Or read the Excerpt, the first full chapter of the first volume HERE.Why is Crystal Shade different? What Auralight Fantasy is?Crystal Shade is for everyone who lives to dream and dreams to live. It is neither a religious nor mainstream angel series, but a timeless story for all ages which explores our souls and the deepest secrets of our dreams. Crystal Shade is an Auralight Fantasy (a.k.a. AuraFantasy or Auralight) which is a new variation on and mix of many genres. While it contains many elements of Epic Fantasy and Young Adult books, along with others from Science Fiction and Steampunk, such as aura-powered flying and other machines and weapons, or a strange world with a blue sun, it also includes various biological-fantastical elements, such as aura beings with superpowers living in the different spirit realms of an otherworldly ancient society. The atmosphere is not just felt, but seen to emanate from the people, places and other living and non-living things. The term Auralight Fantasy was coined to reflect the more overtly fantastical tones of Crystal Shade. While angels and demons play key roles, the series tries to present these mythical and mysterious creatures in a fresh way and to make their characterization less rigid. Because angels, demons, spirits and other religious creatures can sometimes alienate readers, I present them in such a way that everyone can read and enjoy them, regardless of their age, gender, origin or beliefs.
How
long the sequels will be?
Crystal Shade: Angeni, Volume 2, will have nine long chapters, written in the story-within-a-story format and style that I used in the first volume. Prior to the very last rewrite, Volume 2 was approximately 180,000 words long (Volume 1 was roughly 148,000). Crystal Shade: Afterlight involves a different type of storytelling and will number about 5,000 words.
When will the sequels be published? 
My goal is to have the prequel short story, Crystal Shade: Afterlight professionally edited and published by July 7, 2014, the digital edition of Crystal Shade: Angeni, Volume 2 by November 11, 2014 (the franchise's third birthday), and the paperback by January 15, 2015. In order to accomplish all that, with high-quality releases, worldwide marketing and distribution, I am looking for a few angelic sponsors.Some reviews that made me happy; 
(a.k.a. Reviews of the first book, Crystal Shade: Angeni, Volume 1)""The few and faint shortcomings were greatly overshadowed by the
writer's skill and the originality of the story. One of the few books I've read
where you won't feel you have anything to compare it to.""Barnes and Noble Review“I just can't get over how beautiful the language is in this book, it
sets the tone of this otherworldly society so well. It's familiar and yet
foreign. That right there takes a great deal of talent. The imagery that's
described is just breathtaking. I was a bit worried it would put a lot of
religious aspects out there. I was very wrong, and should have jumped on this
as soon as I got it.”Kana, Goodreads Review""This book is a change from everything I've read recently. The story
itself unfolds more gently, the action moving at a slower pace most of the
time. The writing is beautiful. Elegant, even.""Rebecca
McKinnon, The Crooked Word""Beautiful writing. A story line that is well thought out.""David Allan, Tumbling Books ""Crystal Shade: Angeni, Volume 1 is beautifully written with detailed
descriptions of both the people and the world they inhabit. An intriguing and
complex fantasy novel which will leave you breathlessly anticipating the next
Volume."" Star, Bibliophilic Book Blog  ""A detailed, descriptive and imaginative fantasy story.""Krista Burnbright, Cubicle Blindness""The concept is not like anything I have read before which is very
refreshing these days! Crystal Shade is beautifully written with an almost
historical feel to the book. The writing style is, in my opinion, more complex
than other YA writers I have read."" Amy, Following the Reader
“Reading Crystal Shade was both an adventure into a complex world of
angels and a thoughtful beautifully written work of art. Seldom do I find a
young adult novel with both a good story which will capture the hearts of its
readers presented with language that will challenge and entrance the reader.
This author has done both. In fact I was so captivated by the story I read it
three times.” Karen Doering, Parent’s Little Black Book
“This was such an interesting story concept for me, I remember when I
received the book for review, and I remember thinking to myself how is a story
being told by a seven year old going to work. I mean even in the YA genre seven
is a little young, I wondered if I was going to be able to identify with the
character, and for me as a reader I need to be able to identify with the
characters in the book. But the book is really so much more than I thought it
was going to be.""Kathryn S. Steves, UFR ReviewsThe gift of gratitude you will receive from me in return for your chosen donation:

Why?
The way fishermen along the Georgia coast harvest oysters is about to evolve. Traditions that are 100 or more years old will soon disappear, and that's not a bad thing. It'll mean jobs and a preserved coastal marsh. I'll be reporting from the coast to tell this distinctly Georgia story about fishing communities, oysters, economics and the environment. I need your help to fund my reporting and writing of a book length project that will be published in fall 2016. Both the oystermen and I will be happy you helped tell the story. I'm tentatively titling it ""The High Low Tide.""

My grandfather was a lobster fisherman, and I grew up near Malpeque Bay, home to Prince Edward Island's famous oysters. I've always wanted to write a story about people like my grandfather, men and women who made a life for their families by laboring on the sea.
Living and reporting in Athens, in the foothills of northeast Georgia, this was not likely to happen. 
I've reported stories on refugees, immigration, farmers and cooks, all subjects close to my heart, but I've longed as a storyteller to head to the coast and find a few heroes to immortalize in book form. 
Two years ago I met some of Georgia's oystermen. Since then I've travelled down to the coast a few times, making stops between Savannah and St. Mary's. I've fallen in love with the marsh, the watermen and the shellfish they harvest.
I now have the opportunity to write a book about oysters and the Georgia coast. Here's what it's about:
The next few years are precarious for the coast. Oysters are wild harvested there just as they were 100 years ago. But threats loom for this natural bounty: development, climate change and other rural economic challenges. Luckily, scientists and environmentalists are racing to save the coast, and the oystermen.

<h3>A Little Bit About Us:</h3>
<p>The idea of <a href=""http://www.hyrsteria.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HYRSTERIA</a> started a bit over two years ago when we began talking about issues we as, Latina women and artists, were experiencing.  While our artistic partnertship grew so did the idea of creating a publication that focused on the stories of diverse groups of artists and writers. Even though these issues are global, and experienced by many, we decided to focus our efforts on highlighting the voices of creators in our own community of Baltimore, Maryland.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where you come in:</h3>
<p>We are so excited about this second issue, that we started planning it as soon as we launched the first one.  We have gathered writers and artists and now we need your help!

<h3>What We've Done So Far:</h3>
<p>In the spring of 2015 we were able to launch and publish HYRSTERIA'S first issue with the support of The Contemporary’s Grit Fund and the Andy Warhol foundation. Thanks to that we were able to make high-quality copies of our zine, pay a modest fee to our writers, artists, and collaborators. </p>
<p>Now, HYRSTERIA can be found in some independent bookstores in Maryland and New York. We have also participated in various zine and book festivals around the East Coast.</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","A Little Bit About Us:
The idea of HYRSTERIA started a bit over two years ago when we began talking about issues we as, Latina women and artists, were experiencing.  While our artistic partnertship grew so did the idea of creating a publication that focused on the stories of diverse groups of artists and writers. Even though these issues are global, and experienced by many, we decided to focus our efforts on highlighting the voices of creators in our own community of Baltimore, Maryland.

<p>The Foundation for Human Movement Studies has partnered with Indiegogo to develop a fundraising campaign to support Jeanne Bergen as she completes her book, <em>The Skier’s Universe</em>. The book, which is three-quarters written, explores the sport of skiing from many directions and introduces the principles of Spacial Dynamics® as taught by Jaimen McMillan and the Spacial Dynamics Institute. Funds raised will support Jeanne as she completes her research and refines her spatial observations on the ski slopes (especially as they apply to ski technique), drawing on her background as a student of Spacial Dynamics. Funding will help support her work and create a book that is accessible to the public, to skiers, and to people interested in both Spacial Dynamics and movement in general.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>A little about Jeanne…</strong></p>
<p>Jeanne was one of the founders of what became the Hawthorne Valley Association (including the Hawthorne Valley Farm and Hawthorne Valley Waldorf School) in Harlemville, N.Y.  She wore various hats, doing administrative and development work, acting as the community’s first vegetable gardener, working with children in what is now the Visiting Students Program, and teaching high-school biology. Jeanne also designed and led a cross-country ski program and later an ice-skating program.  In 1978, searching for a movement discipline to complement skiing and ski teaching, to train balance, fluidity, and spatial awareness, she traveled to Stuttgart, Germany, to take the Bothmer gymnastic training, where she met Jaimen McMillan. She helped organize the first Waldorf physical-education curriculum conference with Jaimen in 1986, which was followed by annual summer conferences. Jeanne administered the formation of the first Spacial Dynamics Institute (SDI) In-Service Training Program in 1989 (though SDI was initially called Spatial Studies Institute, or SSI). She served as SDI’s administrator until 2002, helping to form and build the SDI organization and contribute to the spreading of the ideas and principles behind Spacial Dynamics  Jeanne has been a serious skier, interested in the technical, historical, and spiritual aspects of skiing, for several decades. She is an expert skier and enjoys skiing serious western terrain, including powder. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What you can help us achieve…</strong></p>
<p>Developing the funding to complete this book is an important step towards getting it published and out into the world.  We hope that the book will increase public exposure to Spacial Dynamics, resonating with skiers’ own experiences, and interest them in the principles of Spacial Dynamics. In Jeanne's words “I started making notes for this book over 30 years ago. I could not have written it without a background in Spacial Dynamics.”  We want to help Jeanne bring deeper insights and new levels of awareness to the sport of skiing. We hope you will find this a worthy goal, because with your support we can fund Jeanne to see this book completed!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is needed…</strong></p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of the funding needed for Jeanne to complete the research, observations, and writing to finish <em>The Skier's Universe:</em> </p>
<p>$2,880 - Stipend for living Expenses (12 weeks, 12 hours per week, $20 per hour)</p>
<p>$570 - Eastern ski area lift tickets</p>
<p>$570 - Western ski area passes and lift tickets</p>
<p>$310 - Indigogo and Credit Card surcharges</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">$402 - FHMS Overhead</span> </p>
<p><strong>$4,732</strong> - Total Request* </p>
<p>* Additional funding beyond <strong>$4,732 </strong>could enhance research for <em>The Skier's Universe </em>and enable Jeanne to branch out a bit, for example renting and testing the latest super-fat and reverse-sidecut equipment and pursuing some additional therapies to be evaluated in the chapter called “Spatial Strategies for Injuries”.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Looking ahead to publication:</strong></p>
<p>●Up to $2,400 could allow for plentiful illustrations and diagrams throughout the book;</p>
<p>●Up to $4,800 could allow for a professional videographer to develop online video footage to supplement descriptions, illustrations, and diagrams in the text;</p>

<p><span>On Indiegogo's suggested outline for ""the pitch"" they have this section last, however, we realize we are not on here raising money to eradicate some horrible disease or feed hungry children or help the elderly pay their medical bills.  Believe us when we say we have looked through the campaigns here and are awestruck by the compassion and generosity on display in many of the fundraising efforts. We wanted to let you know, right here at the beginning, what we can pledge: If you support us in starting our publishing company we will not take that for granted.  Once the business is running and is successful we promise we will remember it was built by donations and as such will support other campaigns that are  performing charitable work such as reading programs to help illiterate adults and outreach programs that work with at risk youth.  </span></p>
<p><span>Though we are asking you to help us start a for profit company, it will be a company with a social conscience and it will help those community and non-profit organizations that are doing much needed and admirable work.  From our perspective this is for the love of books, writing and reading, not profit or fame.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Us</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Laura and Dave are cousins who grew up much more like brother and sister.  Though Laura was always the bigger book worm, from an early age, the dream was for Dave to write and Laura to illustrate.  As we all know, life sometimes has its own ideas of how things should work.  It turns out Laura wrote the book... and a very good one at that. <strong>    </strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Our Plan... in Brief</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Since it is nearly impossible for new writers to get noticed by the large publishing houses, we have decided to start our own publishing company.  Our initial project will be to get Laura's first book on the market.  Since this book is the first of a series, future goals will be, of course, to publish future works (one of which is complete, another of which is half finished).  Once we have our feet wet and are able to build capacity, we'll start to look for other great, undiscovered talent to help.  Remember, Harry Potter was initially published by a small house because the larger houses wouldn't take a chance on an unknown author.</span></p>
<p><span>Depending on how much we are able to raise and, if needed, borrow, will largely determine our printing and marketing plans for the first book.  This is discussed more in the following section.   </span></p>
<p><span><strong>What We Need</strong></span></p>
<p><span>It is said, ""you have to spend money to make money.""  Therein lies the problem so many who have had dreams have encountered.  We need start up funds - plain and simple.  We absolutely believe in this project and are, of course, investing what we can of our own funds, but, like most, we do not have thousands of dollars laying around in disposable, fluid assets.  If we did, we wouldn't be coming to you with this Indiegogo campaign.</span></p>
<p><span>The very basic initial costs, which include, filing the paperwork to form the company and securing ISBN numbers and their corresponding barcodes are reasonable... approximately $1200.</span></p>
<p><span>The majority of money raised in this campaign will go to the larger obstacle of initial printing fees and marketing efforts.  We have set a goal of $5000.  This will not fully fund our effort, but will give us a good start.  And we wanted a somewhat reasonable goal.  Of course, every dollar raised here is a dollar we don't have to borrow.  </span></p>
<p><span>Exact costs for printing are difficult to project as printing fees can vary widely based on many variables.  One choice to be made is between the two primary printing methods, each with advantages and disadvantages.  Print on Demand is a newer method that many smaller publishers and self-published authors have used to help control costs.  While this method has cheaper up front costs because it does not require that you order in large numbers, the quality can be lower and per copy costs are actually higher.  The time honored method of off-set printing has low per copy costs and better quality, but typically requires orders of larger quantities.  Aside from causing higher up front costs, this also raises the issue of storage space.  With these two methods available, we can print as few as a couple of copies to thousands in our initial run.  These decisions will have to be made when we have a better idea of the resources available.  </span></p>
<p><span>Ideally we will have enough funds on hand to utilize off-set printing.  If we meet our goal of $5000 that means we will be able to print approximately 2000 books but will leave little left for other expenses.              </span></p>

<p><span><strong>A Little Taste...</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Prologue</strong></span></p>
<p><span>As she slowly pulled the door shut, the shaft of light from the top of the stairs shrank, until the only thing illuminated were the two fingers of his left hand. </span></p>
<p><span>The door clicked shut a moment later, plunging him into complete darkness and for the first time, showing her the light.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Chapter 1</strong></span></p>
<p><span>He’d passed by the house at least twice a day for the past two weeks while riding his bike and every time she was there, he watched her out of the corner of his eye. She never looked up as he passed and he never slowed enough to make himself noticed. </span></p>
<p><span>But he wanted to.</span></p>
<p><span>He wished she would at least glance his way so he’d have an excuse to stop.</span></p>
<p><span>And being just 15, he didn’t have the courage, gumption or enough of what some would call an approaching sense of self, to talk to her first.</span></p>
<p><span>Until now.</span></p>
<p><span>Because now he had a reason. </span></p>
<p><span>Oh, it was a crappy, concocted, ‘set the chain of events in motion’ kind of reason, but again, being 15, he thought it was pure gold.</span></p>
<p><span>He pretended his tire was going flat.  It was simple. It was ideal. It was perfect … and also rather stupid.</span></p>
<p><span>In the quick and easy act of leaning forward to stare at the tire, he managed to over-balance, tip sideways, knock into the small picket fence surrounding the front yard and take out several small, purple flowered bushes. </span></p>
<p><span>This of course not only made her look up but she stood quickly, knocking the pile of paper in her lap to the ground.</span></p>
<p><span>He righted himself quickly, turned a lurid shade of red in embarrassment and said the first thing that popped in his brain, “so, you like paper huh?”</span></p>
<p><span>After this, he just stood, wondering how odd it would be if he began banging his head on the concrete and wailing in sheer idiocy at his previous and hopefully last statement ever.</span></p>
<p><span>The girl, standing stock still on the porch steps, didn’t come over, didn’t open her mouth, didn’t seem to even be breathing. She just stared until the boy thought it better for everyone if he just got the hell out of there and found a new bike route.</span></p>
<p><span>Giving a small, pathetic wave by way of apology for disturbing her, he turned and continued down the street.</span></p>
<p><span>Later that night, he sat at his family’s dinner table long after his brothers had run off to various summer entertainments: bike-riding, evening jobs, video games. He sat so long that his mother came over and tried to pry out of him exactly why he’d been so quiet. But prying tonight would be fruitless. And soon, his mother just shook her head, ruffled his hair and asked if he’d like to join them in a game of Monopoly.</span></p>
<p><span>With a shake of his head, “no thanks. I’ve still gotta go cut the lawn. It’s my turn.”</span></p>
<p><span>“Well, maybe when you’re done, see if Nate’ll help with the trimming. If I recall, he owes you for taking out the trash last week.”</span></p>
<p><span>Finally smiling, “good thinkin’.”</span></p>
<p><span>The next day, he found himself following his usual route. He wasn’t sure why but for some reason, there he was, pedaling along, feeling an overwhelming nervousness and excitement mixed with a healthy dose of embarrassment.</span></p>
<p><span>He wanted to see her again. And he wasn’t disappointed. As he approached the house, there she was, this time a book propped on her lap rather than the paper. She was looking right at him as he swallowed hard and put on the brakes.</span></p>
<p><span>“No paper today?” She shook her head and held up the book so he could see the title, Algebra for Dummies, “huh? Just some light summer reading?”</span></p>
<p><span>She shook her head again, although this time a voice followed, “summer school.” Now, normally, he’d have responded with something but after hearing her voice, coupled with the piercing green eyes, he managed to forget just exactly how to speak. So he instead stood, staring openly at her until she finally, finally, finally, broke into a small smile, “you okay there?”</span></p>
<p><span>And he crashed back to Earth.</span></p>
<p><span>Shaking his head, “um, yeah. Sorry. Didn’t mean to stare.”</span></p>
<p><span>“It’s all right. Algebra pretty much makes me catatonic as well.”</span></p>
<p><span>Returning the smile, “I’m Jack.”</span></p>
<p><span>“Would you laugh if I said my name was Jill?”</span></p>
<p><span>“Probably.”</span></p>
<p><span>“Just checking.”</span></p>
<p><span>Slightly intrigued now, he hesitated before asking, “is, um, your name Jill?”</span></p>
<p><span>“No. I just wondered if you’d laugh.”</span></p>
<p><span>Shaking his head, “so, you gonna make me guess ‘cause we could be here an awful long time?”</span></p>
<p><span>Setting her book on the porch, she walked towards him, “I imagine you might end up trying names like Bertha or Clementine and I just couldn’t handle that so,” holding out her hand, “I’m Emily.”</span></p>
<p><span>After shaking her hand in an oddly formal gesture, she excused herself quickly, “I hate to go but I’ve gotta get ready for work. I’m sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span>“You have a job?”</span></p>
<p><span>She nodded her head, “yeah. I work at a Chinese place at night, washing dishes and bussing tables.”</span></p>
<p><span>“Are you 16?”</span></p>
<p><span>“Nope.”</span></p>
<p><span>Figuring her mom had signed some kind of work release, he moved on, “what about your Algebra?”</span></p>
<p><span>“That’s for after I get home.” Turning towards the house, she stopped and faced him again, “why didn’t you ever stop to say hello before?”</span></p>
<p><span>Feeling the heat burn his cheeks, he couldn’t believe the honest answer that dropped from his mouth, “I guess I was scared.”</span></p>
<p><span>“Of me?”</span></p>
<p><span>“No. Of those vicious snapdragons you’ve got by the fence. Grabby little things.”</span></p>
<p><span>“Well, I’ll hold them back next time I see you. Promise.”</span></p>
<p><span>“Then I might just have to stop and say hi again.”</span></p>
<p><span>“You’ll probably find me trying to solve for X.”</span></p>
<p><span>“I could probably help with that.”</span></p>
<p><span>Nodding, “maybe.”</span></p>
<p><span>And with that, she disappeared around the back of the house after scooping up the books from the porch.</span></p>
<p><span>And with that, Jack decided that Emily could very well be the most beautiful name in the world.</span></p>
<p><span>It took three more days of drive-bys before she was back outside on the porch.<br/><br/> ""Hey there.""</span></p>
<p><span>""Hi.""<br/><br/> ""I haven't seen you for a few days. Are they trying to drown you in the egg-drop soup?""<br/><br/> She shook her head, ""no, but this math is slowly beginning to kill me. You'd think it would sink in after awhile.""<br/><br/> ""Stuck huh?""<br/><br/> ""More like buried deep with no hope of resurrection."" Shrugging, ""but I'll get it eventually. I always do.""<br/><br/> ""You know, I know somebody who knows pretty much what X equals all the time. Maybe I could convince him to help you.""<br/><br/> ""You know a guy?""<br/><br/> ""Last I checked, he had an A or something like that.""<br/><br/> ""Would that be you?""<br/><br/> ""Am I that transparent?""<br/><br/> ""Just a little bit but I'll forgive you if you can tell me what a factorial is.""<br/><br/> ""Oh lord, do we have some work to do.""</span></p>
<p><span>And so they sat.</span></p>
<p><span>And learned.</span></p>
<p><span>And talked just a little bit.</span></p>
<p><span>All across the worn top of the rickety old table on the porch.</span></p>
<p><span>And it was good.</span></p>
<p><span>An unspoken routine developed and by the end of the next week, Emily managed to get her first ever B on a math test. </span></p>
<p><span>“We should celebrate.”</span></p>
<p><span>She looked at him, confused, “for a B?”</span></p>
<p><span>“Yeah. Are you kidding? Given what you didn’t know two weeks ago, I’d say that B is a miracle.”</span></p>
<p><span>This time, the look went from confused to bewildered to completely blank, “well, thanks for the help. But I think I’ve got it from here.”</span></p>
<p><span>Now it was Jack’s turn to look taken aback, “what? You’ve still got another test and a final to take.”</span></p>
<p><span>“I’ll be fine.”</span></p>
<p><span>Not sure what the hell had just happened, “wait? I think I missed something here. What’d I do?”</span></p>
<p><span>“I refuse to let anyone call me stupid ever again. You did and now we’re through.” Turning to go, “like I said, thanks for the help but I’ve got it from here.” Reaching out to stop her, the minute his hand touched her arm, she jerked away, “get off me.”</span></p>
<p><span>The anger behind those three words made him cringe back slightly and not wanting to do anything else to upset her, he walked away quietly.</span></p>
<p><span>It was an amazing thing, what happened next. Jack made it home and when he walked in, the house was quiet. Either the Earth had swallowed up the herd or they were all laying dead somewhere, victims of some stupid stunt involving catapults and flaming tennis balls.</span></p>
<p><span>Neither was true. All the younger ones were at the library for some afternoon programs and of course, his older brother was at work. </span></p>
<p><span>That left him to find his mom, calmly sitting on the back porch, her feet up and a bowl of ice cream on her lap. </span></p>
<p><span>Without a word, he came out the screen door and dropped down next to her. She finished the spoonful she was on and offered him the last little bit in the bowl, which he gladly slurped down.</span></p>
<p><span>“So, how’s Jack today?”</span></p>
<p><span>“Jack is beginning to wonder what makes girls freak out?”</span></p>
<p><span>“Ahhh. ‘Bout time you got around to her. I’ve been wondering how long you’d hold out before you cracked.”</span></p>
<p><span>“You knew?”</span></p>
<p><span>“Are you joking? You’ve been surreptitiously digging into old Algebra books, you disappear every day between 2 and 4 and you’ve been wearing clean shirts.”</span></p>
<p><span>“All that points to a girl?”</span></p>
<p><span>“Of course, that and while I was driving to the store the other day, I saw you sitting on a porch with someone.”</span></p>
<p><span>“I assume you didn’t tell the rest of them?”</span></p>
<p><span>She shook her head, “I was kind of hoping you’d tell me first. It’s nice to know something before the mob for once.”</span></p>
<p><span>He grinned at her, then remembered, “but I think I’m finished anyway so it doesn’t matter.”</span></p>
<p><span>“Finished? It’s only been a few weeks.” Turning, she pulled her leg up next to her, “what happened?”</span></p>
<p><span>With a shrug, “she got a B on her test and I told her we should celebrate. She asked why we’d do that ‘cause it was just a B. I told her that with what she didn’t know two weeks ago, a B was a miracle.”</span></p>
<p><span>“Okay.”</span></p>
<p><span>“Then she said something like ‘I refuse to let anyone call me stupid again’ then she walked away. I reached out to stop her and the minute my hand touched her, she panicked, said ‘get off me’ and went into her house.”</span></p>
<p><span>“You didn’t grab her did you?”</span></p>
<p><span>“No, I swear. I barely even felt her arm.” Demonstrating, “I’m amazed she even knew I touched her.”</span></p>
<p><span>Both turned towards the house as the commotion of 4 boys began to leak out the open windows, “so much for quiet.” Looking back at her son, “a piece of advice, something hurt her; from the sound of it, probably a lot of things. You’ve already walked away and I won’t say a thing if you stay away but …” with a tilt of her head, “maybe she needs a friend and I know you’re good at that.”</span></p>
<p><span>With a grin, she ruffled his hair and stood, heading into the chaos of the house while he sat back, his head on the cushion and his eyes closed, contemplating the complicated life of a 15 year old boy.</span></p>
<p><span>The next day, Jack had to watch the younger kids so he didn’t have a chance to find Emily but as luck would have it, she found him.</span></p>
<p><span>They’d all just gotten back from an extremely long bike ride and after dropping their bikes on the driveway and collapsing in various piles on the front lawn, all was quiet. </span></p>
<p><span>That silence, however, was broken by a girl.</span></p>
<p><span>A girl with a voice that made Jack smile in spite of himself.</span></p>
<p><span>Sitting up on his elbows, he found her standing on the sidewalk, book in hand, “so, anyone here know any math?”</span></p>
<p><span>The other boys looked at each other in confusion as Jack pulled himself to his feet, “I know a little bit.”</span></p>
<p><span>And that’s how they ended up on a different porch on a different street, the same Jack and the same Emily, only this time, surrounded by talk of Ninjas and Spider-Man and the occasional friendly arm-wrestling match between the younger boys.</span></p>
<p><span>Jack only joined in when his ample knowledge of the ninja was needed to settle several arguments.</span></p>
<p><span>Emily could only smile, realizing that maybe people weren’t so bad after all.</span></p>
<p><span>Emily was gone before Mrs. Callaghan got home but from the look on her son’s face, it appeared that everything would be just fine and with a smile, she informed him that she would eventually have to meet this girl, for security purposes and all.</span></p>

</div></div>","The Impact
On Indiegogo's suggested outline for ""the pitch"" they have this section last, however, we realize we are not on here raising money to eradicate some horrible disease or feed hungry children or help the elderly pay their medical bills.  Believe us when we say we have looked through the campaigns here and are awestruck by the compassion and generosity on display in many of the fundraising efforts. We wanted to let you know, right here at the beginning, what we can pledge: If you support us in starting our publishing company we will not take that for granted.  Once the business is running and is successful we promise we will remember it was built by donations and as such will support other campaigns that are  performing charitable work such as reading programs to help illiterate adults and outreach programs that work with at risk youth.  
Though we are asking you to help us start a for profit company, it will be a company with a social conscience and it will help those community and non-profit organizations that are doing much needed and admirable work.  From our perspective this is for the love of books, writing and reading, not profit or fame.
Us
Laura and Dave are cousins who grew up much more like brother and sister.  Though Laura was always the bigger book worm, from an early age, the dream was for Dave to write and Laura to illustrate.  As we all know, life sometimes has its own ideas of how things should work.  It turns out Laura wrote the book... and a very good one at that.     
Our Plan... in Brief
Since it is nearly impossible for new writers to get noticed by the large publishing houses, we have decided to start our own publishing company.  Our initial project will be to get Laura's first book on the market.  Since this book is the first of a series, future goals will be, of course, to publish future works (one of which is complete, another of which is half finished).  Once we have our feet wet and are able to build capacity, we'll start to look for other great, undiscovered talent to help.  Remember, Harry Potter was initially published by a small house because the larger houses wouldn't take a chance on an unknown author.
Depending on how much we are able to raise and, if needed, borrow, will largely determine our printing and marketing plans for the first book.  This is discussed more in the following section.   
What We Need
It is said, ""you have to spend money to make money.""  Therein lies the problem so many who have had dreams have encountered.  We need start up funds - plain and simple.  We absolutely believe in this project and are, of course, investing what we can of our own funds, but, like most, we do not have thousands of dollars laying around in disposable, fluid assets.  If we did, we wouldn't be coming to you with this Indiegogo campaign.
The very basic initial costs, which include, filing the paperwork to form the company and securing ISBN numbers and their corresponding barcodes are reasonable... approximately $1200.
The majority of money raised in this campaign will go to the larger obstacle of initial printing fees and marketing efforts.  We have set a goal of $5000.  This will not fully fund our effort, but will give us a good start.  And we wanted a somewhat reasonable goal.  Of course, every dollar raised here is a dollar we don't have to borrow.  
Exact costs for printing are difficult to project as printing fees can vary widely based on many variables.  One choice to be made is between the two primary printing methods, each with advantages and disadvantages.  Print on Demand is a newer method that many smaller publishers and self-published authors have used to help control costs.  While this method has cheaper up front costs because it does not require that you order in large numbers, the quality can be lower and per copy costs are actually higher.  The time honored method of off-set printing has low per copy costs and better quality, but typically requires orders of larger quantities.  Aside from causing higher up front costs, this also raises the issue of storage space.  With these two methods available, we can print as few as a couple of copies to thousands in our initial run.  These decisions will have to be made when we have a better idea of the resources available.  
Ideally we will have enough funds on hand to utilize off-set printing.  If we meet our goal of $5000 that means we will be able to print approximately 2000 books but will leave little left for other expenses.              
What You Get
Because we realize how generous you are being by contributing to help us achieve a dream, we have some awesome perks as our way of saying thanks.
- $25 gets you a huge thank you and a signed and numbered copy from the initial print run of our first published work.  Think of it as pre-pre-ordering.
- $75 gets you the above plus our undying gratitude and your name on the ""Thank You"" page of our first publication.
- $200 gets you the above plus a kiss on the hand from us to you (metaphorically speaking, literally only if we happen to run into you and you want one) and the right to name a minor character in a future work of fiction.
- $450 gets you the above plus our highest admiration and the right to name a major character in a future work of fiction.
-$1000 gets you the above plus us groveling at your feet for being unworthy of your generosity AND a signed Special Edition hard cover copy of the original published work with a page personally recognizing your contribution that will be printed only for those who contribute at this level.  This will, of course, be a collectors item some day.
Note on numbered copies: They will be given out with priority given to contribution level first and then date of contribution.
 
A Little Taste...
Prologue
As she slowly pulled the door shut, the shaft of light from the top of the stairs shrank, until the only thing illuminated were the two fingers of his left hand. 
The door clicked shut a moment later, plunging him into complete darkness and for the first time, showing her the light.
 
Chapter 1
He’d passed by the house at least twice a day for the past two weeks while riding his bike and every time she was there, he watched her out of the corner of his eye. She never looked up as he passed and he never slowed enough to make himself noticed. 
But he wanted to.
He wished she would at least glance his way so he’d have an excuse to stop.
And being just 15, he didn’t have the courage, gumption or enough of what some would call an approaching sense of self, to talk to her first.
Until now.
Because now he had a reason. 
Oh, it was a crappy, concocted, ‘set the chain of events in motion’ kind of reason, but again, being 15, he thought it was pure gold.
He pretended his tire was going flat.  It was simple. It was ideal. It was perfect … and also rather stupid.
In the quick and easy act of leaning forward to stare at the tire, he managed to over-balance, tip sideways, knock into the small picket fence surrounding the front yard and take out several small, purple flowered bushes. 
This of course not only made her look up but she stood quickly, knocking the pile of paper in her lap to the ground.
He righted himself quickly, turned a lurid shade of red in embarrassment and said the first thing that popped in his brain, “so, you like paper huh?”
After this, he just stood, wondering how odd it would be if he began banging his head on the concrete and wailing in sheer idiocy at his previous and hopefully last statement ever.
The girl, standing stock still on the porch steps, didn’t come over, didn’t open her mouth, didn’t seem to even be breathing. She just stared until the boy thought it better for everyone if he just got the hell out of there and found a new bike route.
Giving a small, pathetic wave by way of apology for disturbing her, he turned and continued down the street.
Later that night, he sat at his family’s dinner table long after his brothers had run off to various summer entertainments: bike-riding, evening jobs, video games. He sat so long that his mother came over and tried to pry out of him exactly why he’d been so quiet. But prying tonight would be fruitless.

“Well, maybe when you’re done, see if Nate’ll help with the trimming. If I recall, he owes you for taking out the trash last week.”
Finally smiling, “good thinkin’.”
The next day, he found himself following his usual route. He wasn’t sure why but for some reason, there he was, pedaling along, feeling an overwhelming nervousness and excitement mixed with a healthy dose of embarrassment.
He wanted to see her again. And he wasn’t disappointed. As he approached the house, there she was, this time a book propped on her lap rather than the paper. She was looking right at him as he swallowed hard and put on the brakes.
“No paper today?” She shook her head and held up the book so he could see the title, Algebra for Dummies, “huh? Just some light summer reading?”

So he instead stood, staring openly at her until she finally, finally, finally, broke into a small smile, “you okay there?”
And he crashed back to Earth.
Shaking his head, “um, yeah. Sorry. Didn’t mean to stare.”
“It’s all right. Algebra pretty much makes me catatonic as well.”
Returning the smile, “I’m Jack.”
“Would you laugh if I said my name was Jill?”
“Probably.”
“Just checking.”
Slightly intrigued now, he hesitated before asking, “is, um, your name Jill?”
“No. I just wondered if you’d laugh.”
Shaking his head, “so, you gonna make me guess ‘cause we could be here an awful long time?”
Setting her book on the porch, she walked towards him, “I imagine you might end up trying names like Bertha or Clementine and I just couldn’t handle that so,” holding out her hand, “I’m Emily.”
After shaking her hand in an oddly formal gesture, she excused herself quickly, “I hate to go but I’ve gotta get ready for work. I’m sorry.”
“You have a job?”
She nodded her head, “yeah. I work at a Chinese place at night, washing dishes and bussing tables.”
“Are you 16?”
“Nope.”
Figuring her mom had signed some kind of work release, he moved on, “what about your Algebra?”
“That’s for after I get home.” Turning towards the house, she stopped and faced him again, “why didn’t you ever stop to say hello before?”
Feeling the heat burn his cheeks, he couldn’t believe the honest answer that dropped from his mouth, “I guess I was scared.”
“Of me?”
“No. Of those vicious snapdragons you’ve got by the fence. Grabby little things.”
“Well, I’ll hold them back next time I see you. Promise.”
“Then I might just have to stop and say hi again.”
“You’ll probably find me trying to solve for X.”
“I could probably help with that.”
Nodding, “maybe.”
And with that, she disappeared around the back of the house after scooping up the books from the porch.
And with that, Jack decided that Emily could very well be the most beautiful name in the world.
It took three more days of drive-bys before she was back outside on the porch. ""Hey there.""
""Hi."" ""I haven't seen you for a few days. Are they trying to drown you in the egg-drop soup?"" She shook her head, ""no, but this math is slowly beginning to kill me. You'd think it would sink in after awhile."" ""Stuck huh?"" ""More like buried deep with no hope of resurrection."" Shrugging, ""but I'll get it eventually. I always do."" ""You know, I know somebody who knows pretty much what X equals all the time. Maybe I could convince him to help you."" ""You know a guy?"" ""Last I checked, he had an A or something like that."" ""Would that be you?"" ""Am I that transparent?"" ""Just a little bit but I'll forgive you if you can tell me what a factorial is."" ""Oh lord, do we have some work to do.""
And so they sat.
And learned.
And talked just a little bit.
All across the worn top of the rickety old table on the porch.
And it was good.
An unspoken routine developed and by the end of the next week, Emily managed to get her first ever B on a math test. 
“We should celebrate.”
She looked at him, confused, “for a B?”
“Yeah. Are you kidding? Given what you didn’t know two weeks ago, I’d say that B is a miracle.”
This time, the look went from confused to bewildered to completely blank, “well, thanks for the help. But I think I’ve got it from here.”
Now it was Jack’s turn to look taken aback, “what? You’ve still got another test and a final to take.”
“I’ll be fine.”
Not sure what the hell had just happened, “wait? I think I missed something here. What’d I do?”
“I refuse to let anyone call me stupid ever again. You did and now we’re through.” Turning to go, “like I said, thanks for the help but I’ve got it from here.” Reaching out to stop her, the minute his hand touched her arm, she jerked away, “get off me.”
The anger behind those three words made him cringe back slightly and not wanting to do anything else to upset her, he walked away quietly.
It was an amazing thing, what happened next. Jack made it home and when he walked in, the house was quiet. Either the Earth had swallowed up the herd or they were all laying dead somewhere, victims of some stupid stunt involving catapults and flaming tennis balls.
Neither was true. All the younger ones were at the library for some afternoon programs and of course, his older brother was at work. 
That left him to find his mom, calmly sitting on the back porch, her feet up and a bowl of ice cream on her lap. 
Without a word, he came out the screen door and dropped down next to her. She finished the spoonful she was on and offered him the last little bit in the bowl, which he gladly slurped down.
“So, how’s Jack today?”
“Jack is beginning to wonder what makes girls freak out?”
“Ahhh. ‘Bout time you got around to her. I’ve been wondering how long you’d hold out before you cracked.”
“You knew?”
“Are you joking? You’ve been surreptitiously digging into old Algebra books, you disappear every day between 2 and 4 and you’ve been wearing clean shirts.”
“All that points to a girl?”
“Of course, that and while I was driving to the store the other day, I saw you sitting on a porch with someone.”
“I assume you didn’t tell the rest of them?”
She shook her head, “I was kind of hoping you’d tell me first. It’s nice to know something before the mob for once.”
He grinned at her, then remembered, “but I think I’m finished anyway so it doesn’t matter.”
“Finished? It’s only been a few weeks.” Turning, she pulled her leg up next to her, “what happened?”
With a shrug, “she got a B on her test and I told her we should celebrate. She asked why we’d do that ‘cause it was just a B. I told her that with what she didn’t know two weeks ago, a B was a miracle.”
“Okay.”
“Then she said something like ‘I refuse to let anyone call me stupid again’ then she walked away. I reached out to stop her and the minute my hand touched her, she panicked, said ‘get off me’ and went into her house.”
“You didn’t grab her did you?”
“No, I swear. I barely even felt her arm.” Demonstrating, “I’m amazed she even knew I touched her.”
Both turned towards the house as the commotion of 4 boys began to leak out the open windows, “so much for quiet.” Looking back at her son, “a piece of advice, something hurt her; from the sound of it, probably a lot of things. You’ve already walked away and I won’t say a thing if you stay away but …” with a tilt of her head, “maybe she needs a friend and I know you’re good at that.”
With a grin, she ruffled his hair and stood, heading into the chaos of the house while he sat back, his head on the cushion and his eyes closed, contemplating the complicated life of a 15 year old boy.
The next day, Jack had to watch the younger kids so he didn’t have a chance to find Emily but as luck would have it, she found him.
They’d all just gotten back from an extremely long bike ride and after dropping their bikes on the driveway and collapsing in various piles on the front lawn, all was quiet. 
That silence, however, was broken by a girl.
A girl with a voice that made Jack smile in spite of himself.
Sitting up on his elbows, he found her standing on the sidewalk, book in hand, “so, anyone here know any math?”
The other boys looked at each other in confusion as Jack pulled himself to his feet, “I know a little bit.”
And that’s how they ended up on a different porch on a different street, the same Jack and the same Emily, only this time, surrounded by talk of Ninjas and Spider-Man and the occasional friendly arm-wrestling match between the younger boys.
Jack only joined in when his ample knowledge of the ninja was needed to settle several arguments.
Emily could only smile, realizing that maybe people weren’t so bad after all.
Emily was gone before Mrs. Callaghan got home but from the look on her son’s face, it appeared that everything would be just fine and with a smile, she informed him that she would eventually have to meet this girl, for security purposes and all.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<i><br/>
Q: What can you do with a degree in linguistics? <br/>A: Tell me what you might want to do, and I will tell you how linguistics will help to take you there!</i><br/>
<br/>
Having a background in linguistics gives you a unique set of analytical 
and communicative skills which are truly helpful in the world of work. 
But talking about these skills, and learning about how exactly you can apply them may seem overwhelming.  You may not know how to begin.  I want to help!  <i>Bringing Linguistics To Work</i> is a book
 written by a linguist, for linguists, and is about the linguists who have been forging career paths ahead of you. <br/></p><p>Using case studies and activities 
based on real-life examples, <i>Bringing 
Linguistics To Work</i> shows you how others have applied their skills and training, how you can use story as a career exploration and education tool, and how you can bring linguistic skills to the 
search itself. If you're a new linguistics graduate, a grad student who's 
thinking about careers beyond academia, or just someone looking to 
present themselves in a new way, this book is for you.<br/>
</p><p>This project has been designed to raise the funds to edit, print, and share the book with the linguistics community at large. Furthermore, 
this campaign will support the creation of supplemental online 
resources to be put up on <a href=""http://careerlinguist.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Career Linguist</a>, such as in-depth linguist interviews and short videos like <a href=""http://careerlinguist.com/2015/05/02/10-things-video/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this one</a>, designed to give further

</ul></div>","In late 2011, REDEFINE shifted its focus from traditional music journalism to highlighting the ways in which art is inspired by and inspires other walks of life. Encouraged by the words of fine thinkers through the ages, we aim to create arts journalism which, like art itself, has wide-reaching transformative potentials for self and society.Every article below has come from years of work with a completely voluntary staff. With your help and support, we hope to make an even larger positive impact on the world with socially-conscious and expansive arts journalism.

 


By interviewing individuals with different roles and skillsets, we show how multiple minds collaborate on the same projects and highlight how various types of art intersect.Album Covers Of The Year __ AUDIO-VISUAL Artists, musicians, and labels discuss the complex creative process of album covers.Music Video Features __ AUDIO-VISUAL An ongoing series that gathers insight from directors and musicians.I and I: A Collective Interview w/ Sun Araw, M. Geddes Gengras, Tony Lowe & The Congos __ MULTICULTURAL A four-way interview with two American musicians, one Jamaican band, and one American director.Orcas Band Interview: A Balance Of Majestic Forces A sound and text analysis of two solo musicians on their first collaborative work together.
 


In 2005, REDEFINE dedicated an entire print issue to Hopeless Records’ Take Action Tour and its charitable cause: suicide prevention. We now regularly feature up-and-coming artists who are using their spheres of influence to help the world-at-large.
La Dispute Collect For Charity, Locally & Abroad Vocalist Jordan Dreyer speaks on the band's impressive history of giving to organizations supporting disenfranchised youth.Red Fang Benefit Portland Arts EducationBassist Aaron Beam discusses the plight of funding loss in Portland schools and what Red Fang did to help.


Country-themed mixtapes and in-depth feature articles about regional music scenes encourage understanding across country lines, and bilingual articles grow that even more.The Real Icelandic Music Scene __ MULTICULTURAL An in-depth analysis of the Icelandic music scene featuring interviews from dozens of musicians and industry folks, plus three mixtape downloads with exclusive tracks available nowhere else.Sun Airway / NAM Album Cover Artwork __ JAPANESE & ENGLISH + AUDIO-VISUAL + MULTICULTURAL Interviews with Japanese art collective NAM and American musicians Sun Airway on the visual language of music.Ikonoklasta Protests Against The Angolan Government __ PORTUGUESE & ENGLISH + MULTICULTURAL An interview regarding political turmoil in Angola and one rapper's role in helping foster a youthful revolution.Hands In The Dark Label Mixtape __ FRENCH & ENGLISH + MULTICULTURALOne of our many exclusive mixtapes, courtesy of French label Hands In The Dark.


Will your contribution be going towards a printed publication? Nope! We ceased printing REDEFINE in 2008, marking the beginning of a move towards a more environmentally-sustainable creation. In 2012, we closed our PO Box to discourage physical submissions completely, Save for occasional artistic items, our IndieGoGo has been limited to mostly intangible prizes for the exact same reason.


Art can often be directly influenced by things outside of art, whether they be the social sciences, science, mathematics, or the great beyond. We work to uncover those motivations, to show that the arts mutually informs and is informed by all walks of life.

Every year, REDEFINE hosts multiple events in Portland, Seattle, New York, Austin, or over the internet, which are always low-cost, mostly DIY, and sometimes all-ages. Each of the events is driven by a different philosophical focus, but all work to highlight the ways in which different art forms and divergent communities can come together.

<p><b>What is the project about and what inspired the project?</b></p>
<p>The aim of this exciting new project is to grow and showcase a unique garden of plants
used in South African traditional medicine that are effective in treating
mental illness and nervous disease, and poorly known in the West. Over 300
species have been reported from the fieldwork by the author as having
uses to treat insomnia, depression and conditions such as epilepsy and anxiety
(Sobiecki, 2002). These plants and their uses hold many keys for us to understand and 
treat
mental illness effectively (see Jeans paper on ubulawu healing medicines
 on ethnobotany.co.za), yet very little research has been conducted on
their cultural and medicinal uses in healing consciousness. <br/></p><p>Much of this valuable knowledge is being lost at an alarming rate with
the dying of elders and healers who are not passing on the knowledge to the younger generation many of whom who have lost interest in traditional values.  </p>
<p>Furthermore, the World Health Organization predicts that by 2020 depression
will be the second leading cause of disease burden in the world. This is a
scary statistic. Despite all the advantages of western technology, it is clear
that we are all struggling more than ever to deal effectively with the stresses
and challenges of modern day living. Therefore, there is a great need for
places for healing, personal development and health promotion in our modern
world today. </p>
<p>Together, these reasons inspired in my to create a garden that will serve not
only to research these important yet misunderstood medicinal plants, but that will also provide a unique space in which people can heal in the
garden. “Khanyisa” means illumination and describes the effects of some of the
South African traditional plant medicines to uplift and revitalize the mind.</p>

<p><b>How you can help? </b></p>
<p>By making whatever contribution you like (there are no minimums) one can
even make a 5$ contribution if you want, you will be supporting the
establishment of this research and healing garden. Do see the perks on offer and their equivalent amounts as contributions. For those in South Africa
you can make a contribution through indiegogo or directly into the South African business account.
Please email me at phytoalchemist@gmail.com for the banking details if you would
like to contribute that way. Ps, if you want a perk, the perks will still apply
in this case! </p>
<p><b>What is the money for? </b></p>
<p><b>1. Establishing the garden in the right area. </b></p>
<p>We have already identified two very promising sites where the pilot garden
can be established, (Umphakatsi eco-village, Mpumalanga
 Province, South Africa,
and Magwa Falls, Transkei). We still need to conduct
a feasibility assessment at one of the sites (2 months) and then assess the
findings together in terms of accessibility, growing conditions and richness of
indigenous knowledge. </p>
<p><b>2. Constructing a research base camp from which to establish the Khanyisa
plant healing space and garden. </b></p>
<p>Once the site is selected, we will construct a basic research rondavel
(building) that will be used as a base camp from which to establish the garden
and healing space and to conduct the anthropological fieldwork to document the
indigenous plant use of the surrounding area. The building will also serve as a
plant material collection, preparation and plant identification space (plant
voucher specimens), and seed collection and storage facility.</p>
<p><b>3. Creating the Khanyisa plant healing space and garden. </b></p>
<p>Using permaculture design, the plant space will be designed to be a healing
incubator being surrounded by African healing plants. Locally sourced materials
such as clay and straw will be used to construct the building with a design to
facilitate nursery warmth and plant growth and relaxation and healing for
people who need to rest and recover from illness and disease. The healing space
will be built with the help of local community members and will encourage their
active participation in the design. </p>
<p><b>4. Conducting research, healing and ethnotourism activities for viable
and sustainable income generation.</b></p>
<p><strong>The country’s wild medicinal plant
resources are fast being depleted and therefore strategies are urgently needed
to encourage a working model for their sustainable use and conservation through
South African and international stakeholder participation, that the project
will incept.</strong></p>
<p><b>5. Healing and ethno-tourism: </b>The project aims to
create socially and environmentally responsible jobs for the local African
communities related to the gardens planned ethno-tourism activities, e.g.,
garden assistants, medicinal plant tour guides, healing retreat and
workshop assistants etc, thereby helping to support the economic growth of the
local communities. No such psychoactive plant garden exits in Southern
 Africa and thus this healing garden project will serve as a unique
site for the preservation of threatened South African indigenous plant and
cultural knowledge.  </p>
<p><b>What if we dont meet the target?</b></p>
<p>If we only meet a proportion of the target the money collected will still go
towards establishing the garden in terms of site analysis or garden design etc.</p>
<p><b>Benefits you get from supporting the project? </b></p>
<p>There are many health promotion perks on offer from skype health
consultations to improve your health (Jean is a qualified nutritionist too), to
both western and African medicinal plant factsheets, holistic care of the
nervous system guidelines, and health and psychoactive plant use Q and A’s,
while also free stays at the garden.</p>
<p><b>The factors that will promote the success of the project.</b>  </p>
<ul>
<li>Being passionate about
     using and teaching people about African and other holistic medicine-this
     is my calling.</li>
<li>Being a regular writer for
     the South African popular press.One of the few specialist researchers on
     South African psychoactive medicinal plants. </li>
<li>A unique ethnobotany
     website in South Africa
     and facebook groups.</li>
<li>Producing original academic
     publications on this subject and connecting with researchers abroad
     through conferences and</li>
<li>Holding numerous public
     workshops on holistic medicine and plant use.... </li>
</ul><p><b>Demand and skills: </b></p>
<ul><li>Furthermore, with the
     rapidly growing international interest in South African psychoactive
     plants and traditional medicine I will use the various skills and
     knowledge I have acquired to train up a local community project management
     team that will ensure the continued sustainable growth and success of the
     project. </li></ul><p><b>About my journey with African healing plants</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/193298/files/20131112134450-100_2724.jpg?1384292690"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p>I have had an interest in plants, nature and mind from an early age that
took me to self studying plants and medicines wherever I could. I studied ethnobotany at
University and began fieldwork to find out what plants were being used by the
traditional healers to open and heal the mind in their rituals. I documented
over 300 species from the old literature, being used to treat many conditions,
such as insomnia, depression through to dementia. <p></p>
<p>I learnt from my teacher Mrs. Letty Maponya about how South African
psychoactive plants called <i>ubulawu</i> can be used to relax and boost the
nervous system in a slow and gradual process.</p>
<p>After Letty’s passing in 2013, I experienced a very difficult personal stage
in my life which took me into being ill. During this illness in 2013, I had the
vision to create the Khanyisa
 Psychoactive Healing
 Garden that was to
inspire new light in me. </p>
<p><b>Future Scope</b></p>
<p>Psychoactive plant research in South Africa has an exciting
future, from developing new synergy medicines to treat and heal depression,
post traumatic stress disorder and other mental illness, while also being used
for personal spiritual growth and development. Further, African psychoactive
plants can be used by all members of society as holistic medicine to help clean
the body and balance the mind, and for this we need education, plant
conservatories and healing retreats where people from all cultures can learn
and apply this healing knowledge themselves, beginning a new relationship with
African plants forgotten in the West! </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">It is my passion and vision<strong> of the
Khanyisa psychoactive healing garden to: promote African traditional medicinal
healing knowledge and well-being to all cultural groups. By reconnecting to
traditional knowledge of nature, plants and healing we have the opportunity to
heal ourselves and have a better life!  </strong></p>

plant healing space and garden. 
Once the site is selected, we will construct a basic research rondavel
(building) that will be used as a base camp from which to establish the garden
and healing space and to conduct the anthropological fieldwork to document the
indigenous plant use of the surrounding area. The building will also serve as a
plant material collection, preparation and plant identification space (plant
voucher specimens), and seed collection and storage facility.
3. Creating the Khanyisa plant healing space and garden. 
Using permaculture design, the plant space will be designed to be a healing
incubator being surrounded by African healing plants. Locally sourced materials
such as clay and straw will be used to construct the building with a design to
facilitate nursery warmth and plant growth and relaxation and healing for
people who need to rest and recover from illness and disease. The healing space
will be built with the help of local community members and will encourage their
active participation in the design. 
4. Conducting research, healing and ethnotourism activities for viable
and sustainable income generation.
The country’s wild medicinal plant
resources are fast being depleted and therefore strategies are urgently needed
to encourage a working model for their sustainable use and conservation through
South African and international stakeholder participation, that the project
will incept.
5. Healing and ethno-tourism: The project aims to
create socially and environmentally responsible jobs for the local African
communities related to the gardens planned ethno-tourism activities, e.g.,
garden assistants, medicinal plant tour guides, healing retreat and
workshop assistants etc, thereby helping to support the economic growth of the
local communities. No such psychoactive plant garden exits in Southern
 Africa and thus this healing garden project will serve as a unique
site for the preservation of threatened South African indigenous plant and
cultural knowledge.  
What if we dont meet the target?
If we only meet a proportion of the target the money collected will still go
towards establishing the garden in terms of site analysis or garden design etc.
Benefits you get from supporting the project? 
There are many health promotion perks on offer from skype health
consultations to improve your health (Jean is a qualified nutritionist too), to
both western and African medicinal plant factsheets, holistic care of the
nervous system guidelines, and health and psychoactive plant use Q and A’s,
while also free stays at the garden.
The factors that will promote the success of the project.  

Being passionate about
     using and teaching people about African and other holistic medicine-this
     is my calling.
Being a regular writer for
     the South African popular press.One of the few specialist researchers on
     South African psychoactive medicinal plants. 
A unique ethnobotany
     website in South Africa
     and facebook groups.
Producing original academic
     publications on this subject and connecting with researchers abroad
     through conferences and
Holding numerous public
     workshops on holistic medicine and plant use.... 
Demand and skills: 
Furthermore, with the
     rapidly growing international interest in South African psychoactive
     plants and traditional medicine I will use the various skills and
     knowledge I have acquired to train up a local community project management
     team that will ensure the continued sustainable growth and success of the
     project. About my journey with African healing plantsI have had an interest in plants, nature and mind from an early age that
took me to self studying plants and medicines wherever I could. I studied ethnobotany at
University and began fieldwork to find out what plants were being used by the
traditional healers to open and heal the mind in their rituals. I documented
over 300 species from the old literature, being used to treat many conditions,
such as insomnia, depression through to dementia. 
I learnt from my teacher Mrs. Letty Maponya about how South African
psychoactive plants called ubulawu can be used to relax and boost the
nervous system in a slow and gradual process.
After Letty’s passing in 2013, I experienced a very difficult personal stage
in my life which took me into being ill. During this illness in 2013, I had the
vision to create the Khanyisa
 Psychoactive Healing
 Garden that was to
inspire new light in me. 
Future Scope
Psychoactive plant research in South Africa has an exciting
future, from developing new synergy medicines to treat and heal depression,
post traumatic stress disorder and other mental illness, while also being used
for personal spiritual growth and development. Further, African psychoactive
plants can be used by all members of society as holistic medicine to help clean
the body and balance the mind, and for this we need education, plant
conservatories and healing retreats where people from all cultures can learn
and apply this healing knowledge themselves, beginning a new relationship with
African plants forgotten in the West! 
It is my passion and vision of the
Khanyisa psychoactive healing garden to: promote African traditional medicinal
healing knowledge and well-being to all cultural groups. By reconnecting to
traditional knowledge of nature, plants and healing we have the opportunity to
heal ourselves and have a better life!

<h3>The Novel</h3>
<p><strong>If you believe in the importance of one's ethnic heritage, you'll want to support the fundraising for this novel.</strong></p>
<p><span>Meet Alex, a young successful America businessman, who for most of his life, is disconnected from his Igorot-highlander heritage. One day after a strange turn of events involving his father's death, he is catapulted back to his native highlands in the Philippine Cordillera Mountains where he embarks on a journey that has him colliding with his estranged heritage in ways he never imagined.  Follow him as he spirals through Igorot, Japanese and American adventures that ultimately bestow him with certain life changing values that will forever alter his life in the most positive way by teaching him that ""there is more to life than being happy.""</span></p>

<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Your Support &amp; Its Impact</span></h3>
<p>Your support will help share the culture of Igorot highlanders in the Philippines, who have successfully withstood nearly 400 years of colonization attempts from Spain as well as attempts from Japan and other invaders.  Many Filipinos have heard about us, but for the most part, the world knows little about us.  </p>
<p><strong>Most important, your support can help make an impact on how people view the importance of ethnic heritage.  Readers will be inspired to take stock in their own ethnic background; whether it is of one ethnicity or a combination of several.</strong>  </p>
<p>The migration of people from their homelands to foreign lands continues to bring about an increase weakening of appreciation for one's own heritage. This is especially true in western societies where assimilation tends to pull people further away from their ethnic heritage.  Many become disconnected with the tangibles that make up their ethnicity such as language and traditions, but worse than this are those who are not connected with the intangible qualities that are at the root of all that is good in one's heritage.  One's heritage is a source that often overlooked as a tool for helping people become the best they can be in all aspects of their lives. </p>

<h3>About Me, the Author: Rexcrisanto Delson</h3>
<p>I am a first generation Igorot, who was born in Bauko, Mountain Province in the Philippines and immigrated to America at the age of four.  My late parents were also from the Mountain Province (Otucan and Guinzadan). </p>
<p>I came to America speaking only my native lgorot language (Kankanaey) and knowing only my Igorot upbringing.  This quickly changed when I underwent the process of assimilation and I tried my very best to become Americanized. Unfortunately, the price of becoming American was the loss of my native tongue and temporary disconnection with my heritage.  Thanks to my late parents, whose Igorot background and stories still resonate with me and the local Igorot community in the Chicagoland area - I am now in a place of harmony with my Igorot and American culture.</p>
<p>My experiences with assimilation and disconnection have become the source of inspiration for writing this fantasy-fiction novel, which is the first of more to come.  As an independent writer, I strive to inspire others for the greater good.  I enjoy writing about the importance of ethnic heritage and ways people can find common ground so that the idea of unity is possible.  </p>
<p>I currently reside in the Chicagoland area with my wife and three children.  My dream is to someday make writing my full-time vocation.</p>

</p><p>  My name is Blake Shields Abramovitz, and I'm a yoga teacher, an 
artist, and a passionate meditator in the Buddhist vipassana tradition. 
 I don't know quite how to describe the depth of my enthusiasm for the 
meditative path.  It feels to me like something to live for, something I
 can stand behind for the duration, something more real than real, like 
the earth itself.    
</p><p>  Lately my life has undergone a massive, all-levels 
transformation.  Old ways of seeing and doing things simply collapsed.  
My identity as a Hollywood actor became meaningless to me.  
Relationships and sources of income I had depended upon for years 
vanished like so many puddles on the street after a rain.  What's left 
are the people I love, my spiritual practices, my art, and a growing, 
glimmering sense that I might use what's left of my life to be of some 
benefit to the world, rather than to seek endlessly my own reflection in
 the eyes of others.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>MY CAMPAIGN</b>
</p><p>  In addition to a diligent and intense daily practice, an 
important dimension of the meditative path is retreat.  In the retreat 
setting, we meditators are able to live for a time much as monastics do,
 committing ourselves to many hours a day of devoted practice, abiding 
in Noble Silence, and unsparingly facing both the intense difficulty and
 the indescribable sweetness which arise in our bodies, minds and 
hearts.  
</p><p>  Shinzen Young is a teacher known for his extraordinary, almost 
savant-like skill at guiding students into direct first-hand experiences
 of spiritual liberation.  One of the eight vipassana retreats I've 
attended was with him, and it left me forever changed.  I felt a call; a
 deep surety that I was in a space where I could really do the inner 
work that I have needed to do for so long.  It was a revolutionary 
episode in my life.  
</p><p>  So, I am aspiring to attend Shinzen's 2013 year-end retreat, an 
extended silent meditation retreat in Palos Verdes, California, which 
goes from December 29th until January 13th-- and answer that call.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><b>MY HEART</b><br/><br/> 
 I'm launching this fundraising campaign because I feel I am at a 
crossroads.  On the one hand, I could continue to meditate daily, feel 
pretty good about it, make moderate progress, and just leave off 
retreats for now.  I could be sensible, prudent, taking into account the
 practicalities of my situation.  
</p><p>  On the other hand, I could get creative, and take a leap of 
tremendous faith.  I could follow the fervent commands bursting from 
inside me, and like the Eagles say in their famous song, ""Take it to the
 limit one more time.""  For freedom, for peace, for insight, and for the
 benefit of all living beings.  
</p><p>  The latter choice is more me.  So I am asking for the support of
 my community in an enterprise that I know will change me in profoundly 
positive ways, and, as surely as night follows day, will thereby change 
the world.</p>
<p>  Will it really change the world?  Here are some words from a 
person who did change the world, for all of us-- Mahatma Ghandi:</p>
<p>""The world of tomorrow will be, must be, a society based on 
non-violence.  It may seem a distant goal, an unpractical utopia.  But 
it is not in the least unobtainable, since it can be worked from here 
and now.  An individual can adopt the way of life of the future-- the 
non-violent way-- without having to wait for others to do so.  And if an
 individual can do it, cannot whole groups of individuals?  Whole 
nations?""</p><p><br/></p>
<b>MY REQUEST</b><p></p><p>  So, what I am humbling asking for is 
two thousand dollars to pay the cost of the retreat and to give a few 
hundred to Shinzen himself, who conducts these affairs at no charge.  He
 merely accepts donations, gifts, at the end of the retreat.  
</p><p>  Mind you, I'll be sleeping in a shared room in order to keep my 
costs down so I can ask as little of you as possible.  And I will not be
 walking away from this campaign with any funds that will not be turned 
over to Shinzen's organization, which rents out the retreat center in 
Palos Verdes, or to Shinzen himself.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><b>MY OFFERINGS</b>
</p><p>  And I am more than willing to give back.  I am a practiced, 
professional vinyasa flow yoga teacher, and a meditator with years of 
experience.  I'd be thrilled to come to you and offer guided meditation 
sessions or private yoga classes in return for your generosity.  If 
you've never meditated or practiced yoga asana, I could serve as a 
quality introduction to either of these deeply valuable practices.  If 
you have a practice already, then (assuming it is not more advanced than
 my own!), I could help you to deepen it.</p>
<p>  Now, if I don't reach my entire goal, I hope still to be able to
 make the retreat by coming up with the remaining funds in other ways.  
However, if I don't end up being able to make it (sigh!), I will refund 
each of you for every dollar you donated. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>MY PROMISE</b>
</p><p>  The meditative path is in a very deep sense a journey of unwinding what is tight inside, of becoming less bitter, less stuck.  
</p><p>  The Buddha said this:  ""There is no way to peace.  Peace is the way.""  
</p><p>  I promise you that if you help me attend this retreat, I will 
practice peace while I am there, and then bring that peace back into our
 world in concrete ways.
</p><p>  Every time I've attended a residential meditation retreat, I've 
come away from it permanently changed for the better.  I've become a 
more authentic yoga teacher, a deeper meditator, a wiser writer, a more 
generous friend, a more forgiving soul.  In short, I've had more to 
give.
</p><p>  So, your gift will have a direct, real and super positive impact
 not only on me personally, but on our whole extended community as well! <br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>LASTLY</b>
</p><p>If you can’t contribute financially, that doesn’t mean you can’t 
still help!  You can re-post to your Facebook page and help me get the 
word out.  I would be sooooo appreciative of any efforts you make on my 
behalf!

  My name is Blake Shields Abramovitz, and I'm a yoga teacher, an 
artist, and a passionate meditator in the Buddhist vipassana tradition. 
 I don't know quite how to describe the depth of my enthusiasm for the 
meditative path.  It feels to me like something to live for, something I
 can stand behind for the duration, something more real than real, like 
the earth itself.    
  Lately my life has undergone a massive, all-levels 
transformation.  Old ways of seeing and doing things simply collapsed.  
My identity as a Hollywood actor became meaningless to me.  
Relationships and sources of income I had depended upon for years 
vanished like so many puddles on the street after a rain.  What's left 
are the people I love, my spiritual practices, my art, and a growing, 
glimmering sense that I might use what's left of my life to be of some 
benefit to the world, rather than to seek endlessly my own reflection in
 the eyes of others.
MY CAMPAIGN
  In addition to a diligent and intense daily practice, an 
important dimension of the meditative path is retreat.  In the retreat 
setting, we meditators are able to live for a time much as monastics do,
 committing ourselves to many hours a day of devoted practice, abiding 
in Noble Silence, and unsparingly facing both the intense difficulty and
 the indescribable sweetness which arise in our bodies, minds and 
hearts.  
  Shinzen Young is a teacher known for his extraordinary, almost 
savant-like skill at guiding students into direct first-hand experiences
 of spiritual liberation.  One of the eight vipassana retreats I've 
attended was with him, and it left me forever changed.  I felt a call; a
 deep surety that I was in a space where I could really do the inner 
work that I have needed to do for so long.  It was a revolutionary 
episode in my life.  
  So, I am aspiring to attend Shinzen's 2013 year-end retreat, an 
extended silent meditation retreat in Palos Verdes, California, which 
goes from December 29th until January 13th-- and answer that call.MY HEART 
 I'm launching this fundraising campaign because I feel I am at a 
crossroads.  On the one hand, I could continue to meditate daily, feel 
pretty good about it, make moderate progress, and just leave off 
retreats for now.  I could be sensible, prudent, taking into account the
 practicalities of my situation.  
  On the other hand, I could get creative, and take a leap of 
tremendous faith.  I could follow the fervent commands bursting from 
inside me, and like the Eagles say in their famous song, ""Take it to the
 limit one more time.""  For freedom, for peace, for insight, and for the
 benefit of all living beings.  
  The latter choice is more me.  So I am asking for the support of
 my community in an enterprise that I know will change me in profoundly 
positive ways, and, as surely as night follows day, will thereby change 
the world.
  Will it really change the world?  Here are some words from a 
person who did change the world, for all of us-- Mahatma Ghandi:
""The world of tomorrow will be, must be, a society based on 
non-violence.  It may seem a distant goal, an unpractical utopia.  But 
it is not in the least unobtainable, since it can be worked from here 
and now.  An individual can adopt the way of life of the future-- the 
non-violent way-- without having to wait for others to do so.  And if an
 individual can do it, cannot whole groups of individuals?  Whole 
nations?""
MY REQUEST  So, what I am humbling asking for is 
two thousand dollars to pay the cost of the retreat and to give a few 
hundred to Shinzen himself, who conducts these affairs at no charge.  He
 merely accepts donations, gifts, at the end of the retreat.  
  Mind you, I'll be sleeping in a shared room in order to keep my 
costs down so I can ask as little of you as possible.  And I will not be
 walking away from this campaign with any funds that will not be turned 
over to Shinzen's organization, which rents out the retreat center in 
Palos Verdes, or to Shinzen himself.MY OFFERINGS
  And I am more than willing to give back.  I am a practiced, 
professional vinyasa flow yoga teacher, and a meditator with years of 
experience.  I'd be thrilled to come to you and offer guided meditation 
sessions or private yoga classes in return for your generosity.  If 
you've never meditated or practiced yoga asana, I could serve as a 
quality introduction to either of these deeply valuable practices.  If 
you have a practice already, then (assuming it is not more advanced than
 my own!), I could help you to deepen it.
  Now, if I don't reach my entire goal, I hope still to be able to
 make the retreat by coming up with the remaining funds in other ways.  
However, if I don't end up being able to make it (sigh!), I will refund 
each of you for every dollar you donated. MY PROMISE
  The meditative path is in a very deep sense a journey of unwinding what is tight inside, of becoming less bitter, less stuck.  
  The Buddha said this:  ""There is no way to peace.  Peace is the way.""  
  I promise you that if you help me attend this retreat, I will 
practice peace while I am there, and then bring that peace back into our
 world in concrete ways.
  Every time I've attended a residential meditation retreat, I've 
come away from it permanently changed for the better.  I've become a 
more authentic yoga teacher, a deeper meditator, a wiser writer, a more 
generous friend, a more forgiving soul.  In short, I've had more to 
give.
  So, your gift will have a direct, real and super positive impact
 not only on me personally, but on our whole extended community as well! LASTLY
If you can’t contribute financially, that doesn’t mean you can’t 
still help!  You can re-post to your Facebook page and help me get the 
word out.  I would be sooooo appreciative of any efforts you make on my 
behalf!

The Manuscript is Ready!The entire manuscript weighs in at 370 pages.  It's been a labor of love for sure!   I wrote this as a bucket list item not planning to profit from it, but you never know.  Now I need a publisher.  I've chosen  Westbow Press..  They can tell you a lot more about themselves than I can.    One Final Step:  Publishing FeesMy publisher needs a minimum of USD 1000 to bring this novel to life for the juvenile market.  Adding transaction fees  and other promotional expenses means I should ask for 1500.The ImpactAlouette's Song is the real deal. It will deliver a faith-based (Jewish and Christian) framework, with a hard-hitting plot especially when the characters deal with both moral dilemmas and life-impacting cold equations.  It involves the use of modern science and technology as part of the plot.  We finally have two sets of heroes who both genuinely love each other and are also willing to sacrifice themselves for the others' sake.You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll ponder.That's what believe I can promise to nearly all readers willing to be receptive.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p align=""justify"">     Because of the limited literary market in my country I want to be able to translate the volume in English to reach an appropriate market and increase my chances as a writer. Writing a book is no easy task. But, however difficult it may be, the most difficult part is for it to reach its readers.

<p align=""justify"">     Translating and editing a book is not cheap at all, regarding the difficulty of the process. And I have a 500 pages novel. That is why I rely upon your good will. Every donation will bring me closer to my goal, to my independence, and every dollar counts.</p>

<h3>In aller Kürze</h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><i>Nachdem wir nun schon einige Monate an dem Magazin arbeiten haben wir viele von euch kennen gelernt. Wir waren auf US-Car Treffen, bei Autohändlern, haben uns mit Tuningclubs getroffen, die JDM Szene entdeckt, bei ein paar echt reichen und netten Menschen in die Garagen gucken dürfen und schließlich haben wir auch noch erste Erfahrungen mit Herstellern und nicht zuletzt mit jeder Menge Autofans machen dürfen. Das wunderbare ist, wir haben es selten erlebt, dass Menschen derart begeistert von etwas waren. Nicht umsonst haben wir unser Asphaltheldenteam in den letzten Wochen um einige von euch erweitert! Ja, wir wollen tatsächlich ein Magazin von Autofans für Autofans sein und warum sollten denn dann nicht auch Autofans bei uns beschäftigt sein?! Doch jetzt ist erst einmal wirklich wichtig, dass ihr uns auch helft das erste Magazin auf die Beine zu stellen, denn wie ihr euch sicher vorstellen könnt, ist das nicht so einfach. Wir können fotografieren, schreiben, testen und gestalten, aber leider haben wir keine prall gefüllten Festgeldkonten. Deshalb brauchen wir euch - jetzt! Nur so steht Asphalthelden am 01.04.2014 am Kiosk. Das ist eigentlich auch schon alles was ihr wissen müsst. Wenn ihr mehr Infos wollt, hier unten steht das Ganze nochmals in laaaaaangen Worten.........</i></span></p>
<h3>Die Beschreibung</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Indiegogo meint wir sollen uns hier selbst kurz vorstellen, uns und unser Projekt. Ok, also wir sind eine Handvoll kreativer Menschen, Grafiker, Texter, Fotografen, Computermenschen, die alle geeint von einer Sache sind. Wir finden Autos super und geben viel zu viel Geld dafür aus. Wir fahren gerne, treiben uns bei Händlern herum, gehen auf Messen und Treffen und manche von uns schrauben fast täglich nach Feierabend in ihrer Garage. Natürlich lesen wir auch seit vielen, vielen Jahren (manche auch Jahrzehnten) Automagazine. Was wir fest gestellt haben ist, es gibt wie immer im Leben bessere, schlechtere, hochwertig aufgemachte, ernstere, witzigere und welche die uns mittlerweile zu Tode langweilen. Aber es gibt nicht das Automagazin, welches wir selber gerne hätten und deswegen haben wir uns gedacht - machen wir das doch einfach mal selbst!</p>
<p>Soviel also zu uns. Kommen wir zu unserem Magazin: Asphalthelden richtet sich an Menschen mit Benzin im Blut. Männer und Frauen, die sich nicht einfach über Autos informieren möchten, sondern die mit Begeisterung und Faszination an das Thema herangehen, die Spaß beim Fahren, Tunen, Restaurieren und Philosophieren haben.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Bei Asphalthelden ist der Name schließlich Programm: Das Magazin steht für Autos, die unseren Herzschlag beschleunigen, und für Menschen, welche die Autowelt mit ihrer Begeisterung bereichern. Asphalthelden präsentiert:</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>spannende Fahrtests aktueller Sport- und Spaßautos</li>
<li>Berichte über Tuning, Drift und die ganze benzingeschwängerte PS-Welt</li>
<li>faszinierende Storys über Klassiker und Asphaltikonen mit dem Schwerpunkt Muscle/Pony Cars</li>
<li>Vorstellung von Exoten und Besonderem</li>
<li>unterhaltsame und hochwertige Features wie: Reiseberichte, Werkstatt- und Herstellerbesuche, Szenetreffen uvm. </li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>Asphalthelden legt dabei einen Schwerpunkt auf fahrbare Automobilträume, die man sich früher oder später auch in die eigene Garage stellen kann. Unterhaltsame und informative Geschichten, ehrlich und humorvoll geschrieben, kompetent und kurzweilig aufbereitet. Da die Redaktion selbst ausschließlich aus „Menschen mit Benzin im Blut“ besteht, kann sich der Leser auf kritische, aber vor allem auch ehrliche und vorbehaltlose Berichterstattung ohne den berüchtigten Spaltmaß-Messer und dafür mit einem grenzenlosen Spaßfaktor freuen. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Was wir brauchen &amp; Was man bekommt</h3>
<p>So ein Magazin auf den Weg zu bringen ist natürlich gar nicht so einfach. Die Begeisterung der alteingesessenen Platzhirsche über die neue Konkurrenz hält sich vermutlich in Grenzen und potentielle Werbekunden sind zunächst einmal zögernd, da sie uns noch nicht kennen. Es ist also wie bei dem Thema Henne und Ei. Gibt es zuerst das Heft, damit die Werbekunden sehen können wohin ihr Geld fließt oder gibt es zuerst Werbekunden, da es ohne Geld kein Heft gibt. Um nicht alleine abhängig von diesem ""Kreislauf des Grauens"" zu sein, wie er vielen neuen Projekten im Wege steht, brauchen wir euch! Denn nur mit eurer Hilfe können wir das Geld zusammen kratzen, um dieses tolle neue Magazin auf den Weg zu bringen. </p>
<ul>
<li>Wir müssen eine komplette Auflage, 100.000 Hefte vorfinanzieren. 100.000 Hefte, stellt euch das mal vor. Da laufen die Druckmaschinen ganz schön heiß. Aber alleine dafür geht die Kohle dir wir hier sammeln können und ein bisschen mehr schon drauf. </li>
<li>100.000 Hefte, das sind etwa 25.000 Kilo Papier die und jemand quer durch Deutschland transportieren muss. Wir sprechen hier von Lastwagen voller Asphalthelden. </li>
<li>Dann brauchen wir einen Anzeigenservice der uns dabei hilft wenigstens ein paar Anzeigen für unser erstes Heft zu verkaufen, aber der arbeitet ja auch nicht umsonst sondern zieht Provision von jeder verkauften Anzeige ab. </li>
<li>Nicht zu vergessen, von einem Pressedienst, der dafür sorgt, dass das Heft auch beim Kiosk eures Vertrauens landet. </li>
<li>Am Ende gibt es noch zahlreiche ""Kleinpositionen"" wie etwa das Lektorat, unsere tollen Fotografen, Fahrkosten usw. usw. usw. </li>
</ul>
<p>Also ihr seht schon, das Ganze kostet ein Vermögen. Aber ein Vermögen haben wir nicht herum liegen. Es könnte also wie immer im Leben sein, so etwas machen nur die großen Firmen, weil die haben die Kohle, die haben die Connections und die servieren euch dann genau das Zeug, was sie euch schon immer servieren wollten. Oder aber ihr helft uns und zusammen erschaffen wir das Magazin, dass es schon immer hätte geben sollen! Ein Magazin von Autofans für Autofans, ein Magazin aus dem Leben gegriffen, mit hohem Unterhaltungswert, in dem man sich selber wieder finden kann und mit dem man lachen kann, welches aber auch informiert und manchmal kritisch betrachtet. Eben ein Automagazin zum gerne-lesen, mitnehmen, im Flugzeug die Zeit oder an der Wand eine Fliege totschlagen, am Strand studieren oder zum morgens gute Laune holen. </p>
<p>Falls ihr euch nun fragt, was man denn sonst so bekommt: Abgesehen von diesem unglaublich revolutionären Magazin zu einem fantastischen Preis bekommt ihr, als treue Fans und Spender natürlich auch noch unsere Belohnungen, die so genannten Perks. Im Wesentlich steht ja bei jedem Perk dabei, um was es genau geht aber für alle offenen Fragen, vor allem die Frage, was mit eurer gespendeten Kohle passiert, falls das Projekt wegen Finanzierungsproblemen platzt - hier die wichtigen Infos: </p>
<p><b>Worst Case Scenario</b></p>
<p>Was ist also, wenn es am Ende gar kein Magazin gibt, weil z.B. nur 3 Leute was gespendet haben und gleichzeitig unsere Anzeigenhelden nicht genügend Werbefläche verkauft haben?! In diesem Fall haben wir etwa ein knappes Jahr Vorarbeit komplett in den Wind geschossen und ihr bekommt natürlich weder die Abohefte noch die Super-Killer-Gründungsparty. Das ist ziemlich traurig für alle Beteiligten und wir werden das gesammelte Geld nehmen, uns Alkohol kaufen und unseren Kummer darin ertränken. Also Prost! Das gilt für den Fall, dass wir weniger als 3000 Euro sammeln und KEIN Heft entsteht. Bei allem was wir drüber sammeln nutzen wir die Kohle, falls es denn kein Heft gibt, und machen eine Super-Killer-Beerdingungsparty und feiern mit euch zusammen. Soll heißen, wir nehmen die Kohle und machen eine fette Party für uns alle, Prost und Schwamm drüber! Nun aber mal kurz zurück zum Ernst der Realität. Alle Perks ab 500 Euro zahlen wir zurück falls es kein Heft gibt und gucken dann ob das was übrig bleibt für ein Einzelbesäufnis oder eine Riesenparty reicht. </p>
<p>Aber das wird ja hoffentlich ohnehin alles nicht passieren, denn wir zählen auf euch und eure Unterstützung. Dann gibt es ein Heft, die Super-Killer-Gründungsparty, die coolen Autos, hübschen Mädchen, heißen Reifen und coole Karren. Also Leute - nicht zögern - SPENDEN! Und mal ganz ehrlich, wenn ihr jetzt ein Abdo bestellt und nebenbei ein paar Euro spendet, sorgt ihr am Ende dafür, dass es dieses tolle Projekt gibt und ihr habt auch noch was davon, nämlich das Heft frei Haus und unsere ewige und immerwährende Dankbarkeit! </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Die Auswirkung</h3>
<p>Was für Auswirkungen wird ein Magazin wie Asphalthelden haben. Wird es die Welt retten, den Autokonsum revolutionieren oder wenigstens die Benzinpreise senken? Naja, vielleicht nicht wirklich, aber zusammen mit euch werden wir Spuren in der automobilen Welt hinterlassen. </p>
<ul>
<li>Ihr werdet alle 2 Monate ein Magazin am Kiosk oder in eurem Briefkasten finden (Stichwort Aboheld) auf welches ihr euch seit dem letzten Magazin freut. Und Freude bringt gute Laune, gute Laune macht das Leben lebenswert und ein lebenswertes Leben ist doch eine feine Sache.</li>
<li>Apropos feine Sache: In jedem Asphalthelden Heft werdet ihr viele feine Sachen finden. Wir testen endlich mal aus dem Leben gegriffen, denn wir sind selbst ganz normale Autokäufer und Autonutzer, die genau so denken wie ihr und vor den gleichen Problemen stehen. Wir klären über Vorteile, Probleme und Kosten auf, zeigen euch automobile Alternativen in allen Klassen, stellen euch Werkstätten, Clubs und Menschen mit Benzin im Blut und automobilen Fachverstand vor und lassen uns dabei von nichts und niemandem verbiegen. </li>
<li>Dabei ist unser ehernes Ziel euch zu unterhalten. Wir finden Autos geil und Autogeschichten können und sollen genau so unterhaltsam sein wie ein Buch voller bunter Kurzgeschichten. </li>
<li>Zusammen mit euch werden wir eine riesige Community, die Autos liebt, die zusammen feiert, zusammen Spaß hat und für Information und Unterhaltung sorgt.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also ich wiederhole mal: lebenswertes Leben, gute Laune, bunte Kurzgeschichten, Aufklärung und Spaß. Hallo! Vielleicht retten wir ja doch die Welt, und selbst wenn nur unsere kleine Autowelt. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Andere Wege, wie man helfen kann</h3>
<p>Vielleicht wollt ihr ja gar kein Autoheft weil euch Autos überhaupt nicht interessieren oder aber ihr habt keine Kohle, weil euch der Vermieter schon im Nacken sitzt und ihr für den Restmonat ohnehin nur noch Geld für Nudeln mit Tomatensoße habt. Weil ihr uns aber so sympathisch findet möchtet ihr uns trotzdem helfen. Wie das geht erzählen wir euch hier: </p>
<ul>
<li>Wenn ihr gerne was spenden wollt aber euch eigentlich nicht für Autos interessiert, werdet ein Aboheld und schenkt das Abo doch einer Person eures Vertrauens. Gebt uns einfach eine andere Lieferadresse an und sagt uns wer sich drüber freuen würde. </li>
<li>Wenn ihr kein Geld habt, aber Connections in der Szene habt, meldet euch doch einfach bei uns und sagt uns eure Ideen. </li>
<li>Falls ihr in einem Autohaus arbeitet oder bei einem Hersteller, denkt dran wir brauchen oft Testfahrzeuge. Nette Kontaktpersonen sind Gold werd. Also einfach mal ne Mail schicken. </li>
<li>Du sitzt in der Marketingabteilung eines weltberühmten Autokonzerns und verantwortest das Werbebudget fürs kommende Jahr. Ok,ok, bitte du musst keine 20 Euro spenden, es reicht völlig wenn deine Firma eine doppelseitige Anzeige bei uns bucht!</li>
<li>Du hast einen 600 PS Renner in der Garage stehen und würdest ihn uns gerne für einen Artikel zur Verfügung stellen. Ok, du hast also einen 600 PS Renner? Aha, also doch Kohle gebunkert, gehe zurück über ""Spenden"" und wir sagen danke. Dein Auto interessiert uns natürlich trotzdem!</li>
</ul>
<p>Zu guter LETZT - was jeder jederzeit und immer tun kann und was uns extrem hilft, ihr seht schon - jetzt wieder im Ernst - spread the word! Also erzählt allen von Asphalthelden, liked uns auf Facebook, teilt diese Kapmpagne, helft uns bekannt zu werden, das wäre wirklich toll!<br/></p>
<p><b>In diesem Sinne - vielen Dank für eure Aufmerksamkeit, euer Interesse, eure Hilfe und eure Spenden! Haltet uns die Treue und wir versprechen das beste Magazin für euch zu machen, dass wir irgendwie menschenmöglich machen können! </b></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Gewinnspiel

Wir klären über Vorteile, Probleme und Kosten auf, zeigen euch automobile Alternativen in allen Klassen, stellen euch Werkstätten, Clubs und Menschen mit Benzin im Blut und automobilen Fachverstand vor und lassen uns dabei von nichts und niemandem verbiegen. 
Dabei ist unser ehernes Ziel euch zu unterhalten. Wir finden Autos geil und Autogeschichten können und sollen genau so unterhaltsam sein wie ein Buch voller bunter Kurzgeschichten. 
Zusammen mit euch werden wir eine riesige Community, die Autos liebt, die zusammen feiert, zusammen Spaß hat und für Information und Unterhaltung sorgt.

Also ich wiederhole mal: lebenswertes Leben, gute Laune, bunte Kurzgeschichten, Aufklärung und Spaß. Hallo! Vielleicht retten wir ja doch die Welt, und selbst wenn nur unsere kleine Autowelt. 


Andere Wege, wie man helfen kann
Vielleicht wollt ihr ja gar kein Autoheft weil euch Autos überhaupt nicht interessieren oder aber ihr habt keine Kohle, weil euch der Vermieter schon im Nacken sitzt und ihr für den Restmonat ohnehin nur noch Geld für Nudeln mit Tomatensoße habt. Weil ihr uns aber so sympathisch findet möchtet ihr uns trotzdem helfen. Wie das geht erzählen wir euch hier: 

Wenn ihr gerne was spenden wollt aber euch eigentlich nicht für Autos interessiert, werdet ein Aboheld und schenkt das Abo doch einer Person eures Vertrauens. Gebt uns einfach eine andere Lieferadresse an und sagt uns wer sich drüber freuen würde. 
Wenn ihr kein Geld habt, aber Connections in der Szene habt, meldet euch doch einfach bei uns und sagt uns eure Ideen. 
Falls ihr in einem Autohaus arbeitet oder bei einem Hersteller, denkt dran wir brauchen oft Testfahrzeuge. Nette Kontaktpersonen sind Gold werd. Also einfach mal ne Mail schicken. 
Du sitzt in der Marketingabteilung eines weltberühmten Autokonzerns und verantwortest das Werbebudget fürs kommende Jahr. Ok,ok, bitte du musst keine 20 Euro spenden, es reicht völlig wenn deine Firma eine doppelseitige Anzeige bei uns bucht!
Du hast einen 600 PS Renner in der Garage stehen und würdest ihn uns gerne für einen Artikel zur Verfügung stellen. Ok, du hast also einen 600 PS Renner? Aha, also doch Kohle gebunkert, gehe zurück über ""Spenden"" und wir sagen danke. Dein Auto interessiert uns natürlich trotzdem!

Zu guter LETZT - was jeder jederzeit und immer tun kann und was uns extrem hilft, ihr seht schon - jetzt wieder im Ernst - spread the word! Also erzählt allen von Asphalthelden, liked uns auf Facebook, teilt diese Kapmpagne, helft uns bekannt zu werden, das wäre wirklich toll!
In diesem Sinne - vielen Dank für eure Aufmerksamkeit, euer Interesse, eure Hilfe und eure Spenden! Haltet uns die Treue und wir versprechen das beste Magazin für euch zu machen, dass wir irgendwie menschenmöglich machen können!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns
