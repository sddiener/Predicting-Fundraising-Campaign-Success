<h3 style=""margin-left: 210px;"">About Us</h3>
<p>My name is Kimberly Yamada, currently a student at the U of Alberta. I am blessed with the oppurtunity to travel down to Tanzania this summer, in order to work with Good Hope Orphange. But I knew I wasn't going down empty handed! So I haved temaed up with the orphanage directly, with the goal to bring HOPE to the children of Good Hope.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.goodhopeorphanage.org/wp-content/themes/GHOS/images/logo-top.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: baseline;""/>Good Hope was founded by Mama Asha in 2005, when she came across a street child who was in desperate need of care. Overwhelmed, by compassion Mama Asha not only adopted the child, but expanded her love to many by starting Good Hope. Today, the orphange operates on the morals that they began on: safety, oppurtunity, courage, love, and of course, hope. They provide each of their 16 children with not only the basic necessities, but also access to education. Good Hope works hard to ensure these children, who have all experienced brutal losses and extreme hardships, can find hope again and begin a brighter future.</p>

<p>Mohammed: Mohammed, now 8, lost both his parents at a very early age, not because of natural deaths, but because of violent uprisings. In protest to a big mining company invading the area, villagers protested...but not peacefully. His healthy father was stripped from him because of these outbreaks. Just as Mohammed was recovering from a tragic loss, the violence rose again. This time, he WATCHED as his own mother died in front of him. Mohammed was left alone, with no family with the means to support him. It wasn't until he tuned to Good Hope that he felt secure again. Good Hope has provided him thus far with a primary school education and a place to call home. Good Hope is the reason Mohammed is able to move forward from his traumatizing past; to become a boy who loves math and has goals of becoming a salesman.</p>

<p>Amri: Amri, now 10, has never even known his parents. HIs mother died in childbirth, and his father shortly after, due to the same violent uprisings that caused Mohammed's losses. He was born into this world alone. His extended family was struggling to even care for their own families, let alone another child. It was the Amri entered the Good Hope family. They brought him in and gave him a family to call his own, and surrounded him with the joy and love he never knew existed. Today, Amri is a gifted athlete, with a love for drawing and English. He dreams of becoming a movie star! But even still, Amri has not seen his extended family since entering Good Hope, as they are too poor to afford bus fare.</p>

<h3 style=""margin-left: 180px;"">What You Can Do</h3>
<p>Good Hope is ENTIRELY funded by donors, much like yourselves. From the meals they provide, to the medical attention needed, to the childrens' toys...every aspect would not be possible without generosity. To help continue providing the love and care Good Hope is known for, my goal is to raise $7500!!</p>
<p>Your money goes DIRECTLY to the children and the orphanage. The money I raise will be brought down to the orphanage, and then used to help expand the orphanage, send children to school, pay for meals, medical supplies, clothing and more. As well, I plan on using 20% of money raised to purchase supplies and toys in Edmonton, which I will personally deliver.</p>
<p>NONE of your money goes to my travel expenses. I am paying for all my flights and accomodations out of my own pocket, so there is absolutely no worry that your money is funding a student with more than enough resources to travel. EVERY SINGLE PENNY GOES TO GOOD HOPE.</p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 180px;"">  How You Benefit</h3>
<p>EVERY DONATION COUNTS! Not one penny goes unappreciated. My direct partnership with Good Hope has allowed me to give back to YOU, our generous donor, and let you know exactly how much your gift means. </p>

<p>With every donation of $50 or more, we are sending you a hand written thank you!! Each child at the orphanage loves to express themselves through art and we couldn't think of a better way to let you know how much your support means! Each card is crafted with thanks by a child themselves, full of sincere gratitude and happiness. We send these personalized cards to you, as just a small token of their appreciation. This allows you to become more connnected on a personal level with the orphanage and know exactly what your donation means.</p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 180px;""> Why I Am Doing This</h3>
<p>Just last summer, I was fortunate enough to travel with Ecuaexperience and help build a community in Pallatanga, Ecuador. I witnessed first hand what a little bit of love and hard work can do for a family, and how LITTLE it takes to make a BIG difference. The families I met inspired me to try and spread love as far as I could.</p>
<p>I paired my desire to help with my love of children, and with a little research, I found Good Hope. Reading about the children's past broke my heart, and I immediately knew I had to help. I am beyond excited to be able to travel down and interact on such a personal level, which makes this campaign so much closer to me. I want to make a difference in the lives of these beautiful young children and help them to achieve their dreams.</p>

<h3>My Dream</h3>
<p>My name is Corina Haywood and I would like to introduce you to my dream. I would like to influence the viability of  a community of hat-makers in Los Angeles. <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: arial;"">London, Paris, and New York each have their own Meccas of millinery, schools and shops that promote a unique aesthetics and vision. My dream is to add L.A. to that list and to help shape that vision, to create hand-crafted hats that are wearable works of art. </span><font class=""Apple-style-span""> I have been producing hand made sculptural hats for men and women for over 10 years out of my home. I make pieces for custom clients, and have collaborated with designers to produce private label work which has sold nationally and internationally at high-end department stores and exclusive boutiques. I have sold my own line of avant-guard hats in a variety of boutiques in Los Angeles on consignment. Over the last 3 years I have been teaching workshops at a variety of schools, art centers and non-profit arts associations</font><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: arial;"">.</span></p>

<div style=""padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; font-family: arial;"">By supporting my goals to build my business and continue to share my craft I will be able to provide a continuing source of education and innovation in the art of millinery for designers and artists in the Los Angeles area. At this time there are very few places to take workshops in hat-making and no design schools that offer long-term courses in the southern California area. Teaching will always remain an important part of my business, as I will continue to teach workshops at local art centers as well as private classes in my studio. With my own space to produce my hats I will have room to hire employees and to take on design students as interns who would not have another opportunity to learn millinery. By supporting my efforts to build my business you are insuring a resource for future designers to develop their skills and build their own businesses. </div>

</div></div>","My Dream
My name is Corina Haywood and I would like to introduce you to my dream. I would like to influence the viability of  a community of hat-makers in Los Angeles. London, Paris, and New York each have their own Meccas of millinery, schools and shops that promote a unique aesthetics and vision. My dream is to add L.A. to that list and to help shape that vision, to create hand-crafted hats that are wearable works of art.  I have been producing hand made sculptural hats for men and women for over 10 years out of my home. I make pieces for custom clients, and have collaborated with designers to produce private label work which has sold nationally and internationally at high-end department stores and exclusive boutiques. I have sold my own line of avant-guard hats in a variety of boutiques in Los Angeles on consignment. Over the last 3 years I have been teaching workshops at a variety of schools, art centers and non-profit arts associations.

In order to continue to share my love of millinery and to make my business viable in the future there are a few things I need:



Funds to secure my participation in an upcoming trade show that is showcasing Los Angeles accessory designers.

Funds to help to secure a work studio where I can teach classes and work with interns and employees to produce larger orders for retailers and designers.
Eventually I would like to employ several artists in the production of the hats and have an agency represent the line to  handle my marketing and sales so that I have more time for my classes and new designs. 



The Impact
By supporting my goals to build my business and continue to share my craft I will be able to provide a continuing source of education and innovation in the art of millinery for designers and artists in the Los Angeles area. At this time there are very few places to take workshops in hat-making and no design schools that offer long-term courses in the southern California area. Teaching will always remain an important part of my business, as I will continue to teach workshops at local art centers as well as private classes in my studio. With my own space to produce my hats I will have room to hire employees and to take on design students as interns who would not have another opportunity to learn millinery. By supporting my efforts to build my business you are insuring a resource for future designers to develop their skills and build their own businesses. 



What We Need & What You Get

The great thing about a flexible goal is that I have a staged plan, so no matter how much I raise, it will propel my dreams further. 
If I raise 1000 I can hire help to produce samples of my spring 2012 line of hats. 

If I raise 3000 I can  participate in an upcoming trade show where I can get multiple orders for my spring 2012 line of hats.
If we reach our goal of 5000 the funding will go towards securing a studio where we can  produce the orders, see new custom clients, and teach workshops. 

We will be producing special editions of hats and accessories for our Indie-a-go-go supporters:
if you contribute $5 or more: you will get a heart felt thank you on my website!
For $25 you will get a thank you and a felt and feather pin to be worn on your lapel or hat band
For $50 you will get your choice of 30% off a hat class or 30% off of a hat from my etsy shop!


For$150 you will get a limited edition wool felt cap.
For  $150 you will get a  thank you and a limited edition headpiece.
For $200 you will get a limited edition straw hat.
For $500 you will get a custom hat in straw or felt.For $1000 you will get your choice of any three of our perks!

<h3>Our Story</h3>Hi. I think you are gorgeous and perfect just the way you are and I am not just saying that. No, really. I believe that we should celebrate our differences and am creating a technology that will make it easier for you to get dressed with confidence every day without fighting your curves or lack thereof. <br/><br/>I'm Lisa Morales-Hellebo, the CEO and Founder of ShopSuey. As a 
37 year old mom to two little boys, 
					I wear MANY hats — wife, mom, business owner, chef, party and 
holiday planner, grocery shopper, home decorator, 
					after school activity coordinator, social planner, and the list 
goes on. As a result, my time is very precious 
					and valuable to me. If it comes down to the choice between going to
 my son's soccer game or shopping for an outfit 
					for a big meeting, my boys will win every time.<br/><br/>However, I do LOVE fashion, so what's a girl to do when she has 
no time to browse rack after rack at retail 
					or spend weeks bookmarking and searching online? My solution was 
running to Saks or Nordstrom's, getting 
					a personal shopper, and literally telling them, ""I have 40 minutes,
 $500 and I am going to this type 
					of event. Go!"" While I do LOVE personal shoppers, this was still 
time taken out of living my life to 
					handle a task that used to be so much FUN for me. There is little 
fun in cramming shopping into a tight 
					timeline while relying on one personal shopper's ability to 
translate my body type, style and budget  
					and get me out of there with a successful purchase. I thought, 
there has to be a better way. Why can't 
					I do this online? Those questions haunted me from 2007 until 2009 
when, after a series of very vivid 
					and creative dreams, I finally woke up one morning and started 
jotting it all down.<br/><br/>My 15 year career in e-commerce strategy, branding, user 
experience and design was the reason for 
					my overactive REM state. The bigger questions I started tackling 
were, ""Why has everything online evolved 
					to be open, except for commerce? Why has e-commerce remained a 
glorified version of catalog shopping for 
					15 years? Why has e-commerce failed to address the way women love 
to shop — experientially with a sense of 
					discovery, rather than transactionally? Where is the fun? Why 
hasn't someone developed a better way to shop 
					that actually saves me time rather than asking for more of it?<br/><br/>After many months of research, documentation, modeling and 
sketching, ShopSuey was born.<br/><a href=""http://www.shopsueymarket.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">http://www.shopsueymarket.com</a><br/><p><img align=""none"" alt=""ShopSuey — the inspired shopping engine"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.shopsueymarket.com/indiegogo/Big_image.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<h3>What is ShopSuey?</h3>
<p>ShopSuey is a search engine that delivers results as visually 
merchandised groups of related goods 
					(think visual collages of head-to-toe outfits). You can then 
dynamically modify the groups by applying filters 
					(i.e. - changing a $5000 outfit into the closest match for $500). Lastly, there is a layer of social influence where 
					we map your Style Profile (Style DNA) to others like you, so the 
more they shop, the smarter your 
					recommendations get. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>ShopSuey's Style DNA graph is capturing the multifaceted and 
subjective nature of taste, preference, and style 
					to allow you to shop by groups of relevant and contextually related
 consumer goods that are customized just for you.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>For consumers, ShopSuey allows women to shop experientially, see
 things in context and modify groupings until 
					they are happy with all the items and complete their purchase. For 
retailers, ShopSuey provides a free, fast 
					and flexible tool to visually merchandise their online goods and 
tap into ""invisible markets,"" while alleviating
					the number one reason for shopping cart abandonment — searching for
 other options.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>ShopSuey will be launching in fashion, but we have plans to roll out
 in other verticals such as, home decor, 
					baby, kids, sporting goods, and toys.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I believe that the future of commerce lies in shopping and remixing groups of related goods that are all targeting your specific taste and needs. <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Imagine shopping for everything in your life this way... decorate your entire home in a weekend, pack for your tropical vacation in minutes, and saving hours every week answering the question of what to wear. <br/></span></p>

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>For those of you who are new to us, welcome! We are BronyCAN, Canada's premiere convention for fans of the show <em>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</em>. We will be holding a convention this summer in British Columbia, Canada.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>We are looking to hold a mind-blowingly awesome convention for all to attend, but this being our first year, we require a bit of initial funding to kick-start our convention. In exchange, we will reward you with your contribution's weight in awesome pony swag! However, some of the tiers are in limited supply, so contribute quickly before they are gone!</p>
<p>We are looking at a hard-goal of $5,000, however, we gave room to grow since this community has a history of incredible acts of generosity!</p>
<p>If and when we reach our funding goal, we will shortly there-after announce our venue/date and promply open registration soon after that.<strong> i.e. The faster we get funded, the sooner you get to register</strong>!!!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are looking at a registration price of around $40-50, however, it will varry depending on how many contributions we receive before-hand. The more contributions we receive, the cheaper registration will be!</p>
<p>(Note: We did not include a straight registration tier reward because a registration price has not been finalized yet, as it depends on how much funding we receive pre-registration!)</p>

About Us
For those of you who are new to us, welcome! We are BronyCAN, Canada's premiere convention for fans of the show My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. We will be holding a convention this summer in British Columbia, Canada.
 
Our Goal
We are looking to hold a mind-blowingly awesome convention for all to attend, but this being our first year, we require a bit of initial funding to kick-start our convention. In exchange, we will reward you with your contribution's weight in awesome pony swag! However, some of the tiers are in limited supply, so contribute quickly before they are gone!
We are looking at a hard-goal of $5,000, however, we gave room to grow since this community has a history of incredible acts of generosity!
If and when we reach our funding goal, we will shortly there-after announce our venue/date and promply open registration soon after that. i.e. The faster we get funded, the sooner you get to register!!!
 
We are looking at a registration price of around $40-50, however, it will varry depending on how many contributions we receive before-hand. The more contributions we receive, the cheaper registration will be!
(Note: We did not include a straight registration tier reward because a registration price has not been finalized yet, as it depends on how much funding we receive pre-registration!)
 
Delivery
We will commence production of all rewards as soon as the Indiegogo comes to a close on January 31st, 2012, and will be shipped/delivered as they are finished (all rewards for a given contributor will be shipped together).
 
Shipping
Some of our rewards are actual physical objects and will be shipped to their respective contributor. That said, we ask that North American contributors add $10 to their contribution for shipping, and international contributors add $20.

<h2>Rowing the Pacific Ocean 2014</h2>
<p>On the 7th June 2014, team <a href=""http://www.fourbirdsaboating.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fourbirdsaboating</a> will set off from Monterey Bay, California on an 8 month row across the Pacific Ocean, stopping in Honolulu, Hawaii as part of the first ever <a href=""http://www.newoceanwave.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Great Pacific Race</a>, before continuing on alone and unsupported to Cairns, Australia.</p>
<p>The whole point of the journey, is to teach children worldwide, live from the boat, and to raise funds for young people and our online classroom. The project began as a school club to teach English as a foreign language to students in the former Soviet Republic of Georgia in 2010, and now has around 19,000 online students in 56 countries who would otherwise have little or no access to any form of education. The project is entirely self supported so funds raised through grants and donations will enable us to continue our work, and to reach even more young people, to help them lift themselves out of poverty.</p>
<p>Working with students in the UK, every £500 we raise provides an educational package to another children's project in a developing country. This pack includes an ipad, mini prohjector, solar charger, speakers, two years access to internet, and a paper map to follow us on our journey. Our main subjects taught online include English as a foreign language, science, engineering, and geography.</p>
<p>During the Pacific Ocean row we will collect scientific data on human physiology, plastic pollution, and cetaceans. We'll also be raising money for the <a href=""http://www.thaichildrenstrust.org.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Thai Children's Trust</a> who care for 2000 orphans across Thailand.</p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What We Need </span></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>To row across the ocean, we need a boat, and sadly these don't come cheap. We need to raise around £40,000 for the boat named 'Mr Toad', and around £16,000 for all the kit, training, and other bits, though we are already being given a lot of this kit 'in-kind' by some great sponsors. </p>
<p>This is a large investment, but the most important thing, is that the row will help us to raise the profile of our work, and to raise funds to provide our online class to some of the most disadvantaged children in the world, as well as more affluent students in the UK. The boat will be then be made available, free of charge, to future ocean rowers, on the proviso that they continue to raise our profile, provide live from the boat education through our online platform, and to raise funds for us. So your support, will really have a long term impact, and make the world a better place for lots of young people.</p>

<p>Have your ever played sardines? You know, that game where everyone has to squish together...  Living in our current home seems about like that everyday.  Some people struggle with being able to have any kids, we have had the opposite challenge. We have 9 small kids all of which were born while we were on different forms of birth control.  Our sweetest daughter Sofira is now 3 years old but is disabled from when she was born early at 26 weeks.  It has been a huge financial and physical challenge for us to take care of her and her siblings but luckily we have managed. We love our family but would like to help them have enough room to be kids. Its hard to look in their bedrooms and barely have enough room to fit all there beds in.  </p>
<h3>Our Plan</h3>
<p>My wife has spoken and is demanding that I find a way to get us in a larger home.  We have recently found a home that will fit our needs of just 2 kids per room.  The best part is it's for a great price but unfortunately in my current circumstances with the housing market I cant do a 100% loan. This means I have to come up with 5% down.  This campaign is to help us earn at least $4000 but preferrably the full $12,000 needed for a down payment so that we may expand into a home that will actually be sufficient for our needs.  </p>
<h3>What you get</h3>
<p>Please look through the things my kids and I are able to do for you and choose whichever you like best.  Also Don't forget that probably the best thing you can do for us is to spread the word about our campaign. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Sardines of the world beware, its time you departed!! </h3>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>UPDATE!!</strong></p>
<p>First off I want to thank everyone who has contributed so far, your help is very much appreciated.   So I just heard odd news from my mortgage broker in that now to get the loan I have to show 6 months worth of morgage payments for ""BOTH"" my current home and the home I'm wanting to move into in my bank account. So this including the down payment now totals $27k that I have to come up with.  Luckily the banks are ok with haveing the 6 month payments be borrowed. So I just have to show it in my bank account then I can return it.  My immediate family was blessed to have just recieved this much recently so they can help me do this part.  Your help with the $12k though is extrememly apreciated now more then ever since all of this is now needed and the $12k cant be borrowed or gifted (I'm told indiegogo won't count as gifted funds, probably since your getting perks for your contributions).</p>
<p>Also as a side note work gave me a good bonus wich counts towards the $12k so were getting closer!!!  Since the House is a ""AS IS"" bank sell, It would be nice to have just a little extra to pay for new carpet in the home where some water damage detstroyed it before we move in but we will make do without that as long as we can just get in it.</p>
<p>Thanks again,  I know with all your help we can make this happen and hit that $4k goal. </p>

The Story
(For the full story, you can always visit our website)

Until it blew over on one of the windiest days on record in April 2011, the Doo Wop era neon Beer Depot sign was a symbol of a disappearing America that had been photographed and referenced as a cultural icon by people literally all over the world for decades.
 
In spite of its established reputation as a classic example of an historic era in signage as well as a local landmark, the effort to restore the sign has been an uphill battle all the way.First obstacle: filing the appeal. Although the sign was on a property that is designated as historic by the City of Ann Arbor, we had to pursue a costly appeal process to even have permission to resurrect the sign.
 
We won the appeal, and began the process of restoration. We had expected to complete the work in the fall of 2012.
 

Then, we hit another obstacle. The insurance company refused to pay on the policy covering the sign!
 
We went to court, and although we ""won"", in this case ""winning"" meant receiving about 1/4 if the estimated value of the sign!Many of the signs supporters had suggested early on that we do a fundraiser like this, but we were reluctant, until this final snag.We have believed from the beginning that the extra expense and hardship we've endured to restore the sign is something we owe the community, so we'll get it completed no matter what it takes.But now is YOUR chance to show YOUR support!

<p>My name is Willi Penner and I have been a teacher for ten years. I always hated Mathematics as a student and found it difficult to comprehend, never mind boring.

The last thing I wanted was for students to end up learning Math through boring, un-inspired paper and pencil testing, assignments and quizzes. I wanted my students to be engaged in learning, to have fun while learning and to be caught up in the spirit of a great game that would double as a rich learning experience. </p>
<p>In 2011 I was fortunate enough to manufacture my game and started holding sessions and professional development opportunities for teachers and parents with it. It's more than a game, its a learning experience, an assessment tool and a fantastic engagement opportunity. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Moses, a young hotelier, technology enthusiast, amatuer writer and photographer. I grew up in rural Kenya, and after a very humble childhood, joined the hotel industry where I have grown up the ladder to a General Manager of a mid range 70 room hotel.</p>
<p>My passion though has always been in technology and how it can resolve the simple and complex challenges our communities face every day. I Love books and music, and faced a big challenge locating shops with titles I liked. I went as far as purchasing items online on Amazon and shipping them all the way to Kenya. This inspired me to start an e-commerce site <a href=""http://www.epur.biz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.epur.biz</a> which sells house hold items and books to locals here in Nairobi.</p>
<p>Our nascent ecommerce industry however faces two major challenges. The first one is payment. Less than 1% of our population use credit cards. Payments and money transfer had been a real hindrance until the onset of Mobile banking. Today, Kenya has the highest penetration of mobile phone banking, money transfer and payments. Upto 60% of Kenyan adults use these services especially Mpesa.</p>
<p>The second challenge, which I intend to resolve is Physical Addresses. Towns and cities in Africa were developed with very little urban planning in mind. There are literally no physical addresses. Except for the CBD, streets have no names. Navigating through neighbourhoods is a nightmare. Essencial serices like policing, response to emergencies etc is made very difficult as there is no address to give to the response team. Delivering goods bought online is logistically not possible.</p>
<p>As I started working on my business, I realized I would need to resolve the address issue if my business was going to succeed. I put much thought to it and realized it was not about my business alone, it is also about security, it is also about emergency response and social services; it is about the well being of whole communities. </p>
<p>I came up with a brilliant idea which I have already started testing, and successfully so. I came up with a way of giving specific points on google maps a unique address that when clicked either on a computer or mobile phone, will open the exact point consistently with the option to get directions. For example, the tallest biulding in Nairobi is KICC. I created the address <a href=""http://www.kwetu.me/nbi/kicc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.kwetu.me/nbi/kicc</a> for it. If you tap this address on your phone, it will open up google maps with the exact location of the biulding. This address can now be put on business cards, email signatures etc as accurate physical address of an office or business.</p>
<p>My vision is to have kwetu (swahili for ""our place"") addresses widely used for giving directions across the country. If there is a fire at KICC for example, it should suffice to send the address <a href=""http://www.kwetu.me/nbi/kicc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.kwetu.me/nbi/kicc</a> to fire services and they will know where to go. </p>
<p>I believe this project is not just for Africa. As the world becomes more and more digital, it will become necessary for even countries with the best physical addresses to harmonize them with web based map addresses. </p>
<p>I have already funded the basic technical requirements, I provide all the man hours and have started testing. Now I need to scale up, put up a team, and cover more more ground. </p>
<p>I need your help to facilitate mobility of my team as they map the areas, preferably using 4 motorbikes and one mini van. I need to buy them lap tops for official use, create an office they can use and pay their daily upkeep.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am therefore welcoming funding from all well wishers, both in Kind and in Cash. If you have your old motorbike you can ship our way, lap tops, or cash, we will highly appreciate. If you are in Kenya and you have office space within Nairobi, that will also be very welcome.</p>
<p>As we move on, we may also need advanced programming expertise (php), so if you have those skills and wish to assist at some point in the near future, do keep in touch.</p>
<p>I believe this is the beginning of something big, it is just the beginning of digitising physical addresses across the world, and this time, we will be starting with Africa For once.</p>
<p>Every Penny contributed will go towards this most worthy cause.</p>

<p>Since 2006, Boston Faith &amp; Justice Network (BFJN) has been leading a local charge for Christians to live simply in order to give generously. Our initiatives support the process of economic discipleship, or put more simply, learning to follow Jesus with your money. In addition to our small group Bible study called <em><a href=""http://www.bostonfaithjustice.org/grateful-living/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lazarus at the Gate</a>, </em>BFJN offers practical resources helping individuals shift consumption patterns.</p>
<p><strong>Fresh Thoughts On Food</strong></p>
<p>One way we’re helping Christians live simply is by challenging our community to think differently about food sourcing. For the industrialized West, food choices often come at a high cost to our health, finances, farm workers and the environment. Christians are beginning to shift food practices for reasons deeply rooted in their faith in Jesus Christ. These simple, affordable changes demonstrate creation-care and love for your neighbor. </p>
<p>Over the next year we’ll be planning hands-on educational programming designed to shift food consumption. In order to expand this programming we need an additional 20 staff hours per week. The cost for BFJN to host this person is $2,500 over and above our current budget. To make this exciting expansion a reality we need your help. We’re asking the BFJN community to help fund the remaining amount!</p>
<p><strong>How Will You Benefit?</strong></p>
<p>As an incentive to support this initiative, we're offering a limited number of food-related ""perks"" generously donated by people and partner organizations that support BFJN’s mission. Perks include items like private Indian cooking classes, home made apple butter, locally roasted Equal Exchange coffee, a year's supply (yup that’s right!) of Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream and a lot more! Each one of these items is transferable, meaning you can also give the perks as gifts during the Christmas season.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Massage has been a lifelong practice of mine. I began giving massage when I was around the age of 18 months old. My parents,unfortunately, were in a terrible car accident before I was born. From this very early age I would go with them to physical therapy, return home and immitate the things I saw the therapists do on my parents.  As I grew older I continued giving massage to anyone in pain, it was always a very natural response for me. For over ten years now I have been a professional massage therapist and every year my work continues to grow. In 2010 I began my in depth studies of Thai Yoga Massage and Ayurveda with Dr. Anthony James at the Thai Yoga School in Plant City, FL. I received a wealth of knowledge from him through his Soma Veda program. It has been a dream of mine to study in Thailand since I became interested in massage therapy as a profession. After completing his Level 1 program in 2011, I realized that it was something I MUST do. There are many places to study Thai Yoga Massage in Thailand, but the one I want to visit and calls to me is the Old Medicine Hospital in Chiang Mai.  Ajahn Sintorn ,who started this school, is no longer in the physical. He passed in 2005, however his son is currently in charge of the school. Ajahn Sintorn was one of the teachers whom Dr. James studied with for many years until his passing. Through his many stories about this school in Chiang Mai my teacher and mentor ,Dr. James, has fostered an ever growing desire in me to attend this healing institution. My goal is to gain as much knowledge as I can during the six weeks I will be in Thailand. I will be studying nutrition, Ayurvedic Science and assessments as well as gaining knowledge in treatments in herbal medicines and remedies. The bulk of this knowledge gained will have to be learned again &amp; again and put it into practice, but we must all start somewhere. Upon my return home I hope to have a more solid foundation which will enable me to start giving free and low cost workshops to families so they, in turn, can give this natural care to each other. True healing and care taking should have a base inside the home and with the family. Another one of my goals is to have a deeper knowledge on medicinal herbs and plants. I am hoping to begin growing my own medicinal herbs and plants for use in treatments as well as homemade salves over the next couple of years. All contributors to my project will receive discounted bodywork, some sort of take home remedy (herbal bath, oil, salts), and the knowledge that everything I learn will be used to grow and sustain a more healing community.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Every day, think as you wake up, today I am fortunate to be alive, I have a precious human life, I am not going to waste it. I am going to use all my energies to develop myself, to expand my heart out to others; to achieve enlightenment for the benefit of all beings. I am going to have kind thoughts towards others, I am not going to get angry or think badly about others. I am going to benefit others as much as I can.” ― Dalai Lama XIV</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am trying to raise at least $4500. This money will help take care of everything while I am away; pay for my school, my housing, and travel. Anything I am able to raise outside of this amount will stay in a fund to help me restart my practice when I return home. I will need a few more supplies and items once I get home and any extra money will support that. Here is a simple breakdown of my costs...</p>
<p>$900 Travel (So far I only have one way to BKK, this is for round trip to SFO from MSY and BKK to SFO)</p>
<p>$1000 School Tuition and Books</p>
<p>$400 Room and Board in Chiang Mai for 5 weeks</p>
<p>$2000 Expenses at home while out of country for six weeks and business set up</p>
<p>$100 for my own therapies to experience and learn while in Bangkok for one week</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I am not asking for a handout, I have many different options to choose from to support me on this life changing experience. Each level will be treated as a gift certificate. All therapies are discounted and everyone will receive a special and personalized gift to treat themselves right with after their treatment. The gift certificates and applicable discounts will be good for two years and can begin being redeemed January 2, 2014. Even if I don't reach my full goal I will still be making the journey so every contribution helps. </p>
<p><br/></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Anyone who has received my massage and bodywork from me can attest to how much my practice has grown since the first time I left New Orleans to study with Dr.Anthony James. This is simply another opportunity for me to cultivate and enhance my skills in an even more specific and detailed way. This specialized study in healing massage will  also give me the space and opportunity to work more on my own healing, growth, and development which will make me more grounded and able to serve once I return home. This is something that will benefit both you and I. I look forward to the end results with hopeful anticipation. Once returning home to New Orleans, I will still be providing sliding scale pricing on certain days for any  low income service workers. I will also be providing low to no cost workshops from time to time for families and people in partnerships. We need to cultivate more loving kindness in our community and I realize that it starts within. It is easy to act out of line when our bodies hurt, but I find it nearly impossible to act so when we are healthy, happy, and pain free. In essence this is a three fold  investment; in your health, my health and others in our community.  I hope that you can help and am deeply grateful for any contributions.</p>

Through his many stories about this school in Chiang Mai my teacher and mentor ,Dr. James, has fostered an ever growing desire in me to attend this healing institution. My goal is to gain as much knowledge as I can during the six weeks I will be in Thailand. I will be studying nutrition, Ayurvedic Science and assessments as well as gaining knowledge in treatments in herbal medicines and remedies. The bulk of this knowledge gained will have to be learned again & again and put it into practice, but we must all start somewhere. Upon my return home I hope to have a more solid foundation which will enable me to start giving free and low cost workshops to families so they, in turn, can give this natural care to each other. True healing and care taking should have a base inside the home and with the family. Another one of my goals is to have a deeper knowledge on medicinal herbs and plants. I am hoping to begin growing my own medicinal herbs and plants for use in treatments as well as homemade salves over the next couple of years. All contributors to my project will receive discounted bodywork, some sort of take home remedy (herbal bath, oil, salts), and the knowledge that everything I learn will be used to grow and sustain a more healing community.

“Every day, think as you wake up, today I am fortunate to be alive, I have a precious human life, I am not going to waste it. I am going to use all my energies to develop myself, to expand my heart out to others; to achieve enlightenment for the benefit of all beings. I am going to have kind thoughts towards others, I am not going to get angry or think badly about others. I am going to benefit others as much as I can.” ― Dalai Lama XIV

What I Need & What You Get
I am trying to raise at least $4500. This money will help take care of everything while I am away; pay for my school, my housing, and travel. Anything I am able to raise outside of this amount will stay in a fund to help me restart my practice when I return home. I will need a few more supplies and items once I get home and any extra money will support that. Here is a simple breakdown of my costs...
$900 Travel (So far I only have one way to BKK, this is for round trip to SFO from MSY and BKK to SFO)
$1000 School Tuition and Books
$400 Room and Board in Chiang Mai for 5 weeks
$2000 Expenses at home while out of country for six weeks and business set up
$100 for my own therapies to experience and learn while in Bangkok for one week

I am not asking for a handout, I have many different options to choose from to support me on this life changing experience. Each level will be treated as a gift certificate. All therapies are discounted and everyone will receive a special and personalized gift to treat themselves right with after their treatment. The gift certificates and applicable discounts will be good for two years and can begin being redeemed January 2, 2014. Even if I don't reach my full goal I will still be making the journey so every contribution helps. 




The Impact
Anyone who has received my massage and bodywork from me can attest to how much my practice has grown since the first time I left New Orleans to study with Dr.Anthony James. This is simply another opportunity for me to cultivate and enhance my skills in an even more specific and detailed way. This specialized study in healing massage will  also give me the space and opportunity to work more on my own healing, growth, and development which will make me more grounded and able to serve once I return home. This is something that will benefit both you and I. I look forward to the end results with hopeful anticipation. Once returning home to New Orleans, I will still be providing sliding scale pricing on certain days for any  low income service workers. I will also be providing low to no cost workshops from time to time for families and people in partnerships. We need to cultivate more loving kindness in our community and I realize that it starts within. It is easy to act out of line when our bodies hurt, but I find it nearly impossible to act so when we are healthy, happy, and pain free. In essence this is a three fold  investment; in your health, my health and others in our community.  I hope that you can help and am deeply grateful for any contributions.

<p><strong>          WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO RAISE $8500 FOR OUR MONTHLY<br/>                        ALLOTMENT OF TICKETS TO ALCATRAZ</strong></p>
<p><strong>When you travel someplace for leisure, wouldn't you rather experience the the destination instead of tourist traps? </strong></p>
<p>Two years ago, while working at a Union Square hotel, my co-workers and I noticed a disconnect between the San Francisco that tourists see and the City that a local would show to their own family and guests. At Explore San Francisco, we propose to change that by offering visitors an opportunity to see the city with a local guide and to enjoy a more personal experience during their stay in San Francisco.</p>
<p>The San Francisco tourist industry is one big pre-packaged experience. The <br/><img alt=""Couple on Golden Gate Bridge"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.exploresf.biz/images/ESFBridge.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; border-width: 3px; border-color: black; margin: 15px;""/>experience, largely created by national tour companies, seems bent on keeping out-of-town visitors within striking distance of corporate, chain restaurants and retail stores while limiting their exposure to the nuances of the City. The only interaction most visitors have with San Franciscans is the low-wage service employees wearing oddly colored vests with shiny nametags or savvy sales people attempting to sign them up for a tour for which they are commissioned to sell.   </p>
<p>San Francisco is a completely unique place, the city's beautiful location and  turbulent history and the demographics of the population have helped to create an experience that is a delight to encounter and just walking from one block to the next can reveal something unexpected and amazing. With all of the physical beauty and enthralling culture to delight the senses It seems counter- intuitive to have tourists sequestered into an area full of national retail chains; franchised, fast food; sweatshirt shops; and overpriced, low-quality restaurants. While most locals avoid these areas, too many visitors never venture beyond. Simply asking for directions at a Fisherman's Wharf tourist info booth, tourists unknowingly may be talking with someone who is actually working in the timeshare industry and/ or selling space on tour buses!</p>
<p>We do not believe that visitors to San Francisco choose to sequester themselves to a small, over-simulated area of San Francisco. We believe they are not aware that there is actually more to see. An alternative for these travelers to really see our great city is not usually available for them. They are getting mugged without ever knowing it.<img alt=""Transamerica Building SF"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://exploresf.biz/images/trans.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; border-width: 3px; border-color: black; margin: 15px;""/></p>
<p>When we encounter these people they are as happy to have found us as we are happy to have found them. Instead of a travel experience designed by researchers to squeeze every last dollar out of their wallet, with us they see the city's neighborhoods as a guest. </p>
<p>Everyone when traveling to a destination wants to see the destination, clearly, and not a corporate-designed fascimile created to mimic the experience of the destination while draining it's attendees of their cash. Everyone, even tourists, deserve to be treated with respect.</p>
<p><strong>Why does this matter?  Imagine the possibilities. </strong></p>
<p>We believe that communication and the exchange of ideas is essential to creating a better society and that traveling to a new place is more beneficial to all concerned if there is a chance for communication between travelers and residents. Local commerce benefits when out-of-city travelers have the opportunity to do business with local merchants. We also believe that tourists have the best travel experiences when they are able to explore and encounter the place to which they have traveled and meet the people that live there. We do not believe that San Francisco or any other destination for that matter is best served by allowing big business to control the travel experience. We live in a fractured society, where people are separated from each other idealogically and economically. Yet that does not mean that we can't enable change, and we have learned from our interactions with travelers here in this city that when given the <br/><img alt=""Happy People"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://exploresf.biz/images/Mar2MisFd.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; border-width: 3px; border-color: black; margin: 15px;""/>choice, the travel consumer is always more satisfied with an authentic experience over a manufactured occurrence.</p>
<h3>Our Role and How We Roll</h3>
<p>Our company operates as a co-op, in that no one is paid an hourly wage, nor are we commission-based.  Each local tour guide splits the proceeds with the house -- 50-50%.  Our guides have an affinity for the arts and include a filmmaker, a journalist, a comedian, and sculptor, along with photographers, musicians, actors, writers, a few students and a select few who choose this work over retirement.  Many of our guides are veterans of the industry, some are historians and some are just very enthusiastic about the city in which they live, San Francisco. </p>
<p>I am the servant to these great individuals. It is my role to ensure that the system runs smoothly and that we are promoted and marketed to the world-at-large. My prior work experience was primarily hospitality-based, but I also worked in leisure travel.  The local guides are free to develop their individual tours to reflect their interests and share their knowledge of a particular neighborhood with visitors to San Francisco.  Our tours are not “canned,” but rather well thought out and reflective of each individual’s personality and experiences. </p>
<p>Not having experience in the tour industry on a local level I was surprised, but not intimidated, by the stranglehold that some large, national companies have on the local tourism market.  I did not realize that the reason most visitors to the city don't actually see the city is really because the information that they receive -- prior to and after arrival here -- is manipulated by companies with big advertising budgets. </p>
<p> Ironically, it is the savvy, well-traveled individuals or those on very limited budget who are more likely to have a real San Francisco experience; basically, this is because the larger tour companies have no interest in them.   From our inception, a large part of our business has come from these two groups.  However, the average consumers are going to be marketed to in such a way that they never see the nuances of the city, but instead a version of San Francisco seen through the eyes of a profit-hungry corporation. <img alt=""Tea Shop in Chinatown"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://exploresf.biz/images/tea1.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; border-width: 3px; border-color: black; margin: 15px;""/></p>
<p>In no area could this be any truer than with one of San Francisco’s most natural wonders – Alcatraz Island. Yet, the fact of the matter is that Alcatraz is the most sought-after ticket by tourists coming to San Francisco. For us to reach the most people traveling here, we need to offer them what it is they want.</p>
<p>We are specifically seeking contributors to purchase advance tickets for Alcatraz Island Tours.  Alcatraz Island is a National Park and is part of the Golden Gate National Recreation.  All Alcatraz tickets sales are controlled Alcatraz Cruises, the authorized concessioner of the NPS. Alcatraz Cruises is currently operated by the Hornblower Corporation. They are required by the National Park Service to make half of their tickets available to local tour operators like Explore San Francisco.</p>
<p>Alcatraz Cruises allows tour operators to purchase tickets through a lengthy application process.   The tour operators are to sell the tickets as part of a packaged tour, with the price of the Alcatraz ticket costing the same as if it were purchased directly from Alcatraz Cruises.  It is an arduous approval process, and until Explore SF, no walking tour/ running tour/food tour companies have ever been approved.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, most of the tour operators who are approved to sell the Alcatraz packaged tours have the capitol and infrastructure to deploy personnel throughout different locations all around the waterfront.  They sell the Alcatraz tour packages that are mostly limited to tours in and around Fisherman’s Wharf and the Golden Gate Bridge usually on the large sight-seeing buses. These tours always sell out during the summer travel months and during the holidays.<img alt=""Ku uup"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/692521/pictures/original/20130306031744-HappyHungry1.jpg?1362568663"" src="""" style=""float: right; border-width: 3px; border-color: black; margin: 15px;""/><img alt=""kuuup"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/692521/pictures/original/20130306031744-HappyHungry1.jpg?1362568663"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p>
<p>Following the three-month application process, we started selling tickets in August 2012.  We sold out our monthly allotment three months in a row.  During this period we were in constant contact with the average San Francisco tourist and introduced them to a whole new world that they would have never seen before. We got the out-of-towners off of the busses, introduced them to real San Franciscans, cleared up wrong impressions, broke down barriers and exchanged interesting ideas -- the tourists benefited, the local merchants benefited and we benefited. </p>
<p>We believe that packaging and selling over-rated tourist destinations to San Francisco tourists is really absurd yet it is common practice; however, we learned when meeting people in small groups, in an congenial setting, everyone had more fun and all walked away happier. Certainly the experience that we are successfully developing here will influence the way people travel in the future.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this new approach to tourism is already taking hold elsewhere because if we are seeing this new approach as a logical next step, certainly other people in other cities are also feeling this way and finding it necessary to act on their ideas.  </p>
<h3>The Bottom Line<img alt=""Chile Lindo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://exploresf.biz/images/PaulaLindo1.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; border-width: 3px; border-color: black; margin: 13px;""/>
</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>We are attempting to raise the $8500 that we need to buy a full monthly allotment of tickets for Alcatraz.</p>
<p>Our concept is proving to be a success and we are growing. So why do we need contributions? We started this company almost two years ago with nothing more than a basic concept, a few ideas and fierce determination. Our profit margin is small and we compete with large organizations with even deeper pockets.  We have come a long way, but the profits that the house realizes, are returned immediately back to the business. </p>
<p> On our very popular food tours, we pay our restaurants in advance. Small eateries are not really set up to to extend credit or to run tabs for their customer base. We get that, and although we are delighted to be giving the money to small independent local restaurants, most of the websites that sell space on our tours do not reimburse us for several weeks and any cash flow that we have ends up being tied up for extended lengths of time.  So that is where we find ourselves now, and we are in dire need of a cash infusion.</p>
<p>Alcatraz tickets are purchased in advance and many of our larger competitors will buy their tickets two or three months in advance, and of course they buy tickets for the most sought-after times first. Frankly we have never had an extra $8,500 needed to purchase our monthly allotment. We currently borrow the money every month and the interest is $10 a ticket or $3,000 per month.  This cuts into our margin and forces us to raise the price of our packaged tours, making us less competitive. This situation puts us at a severe disadvantage in the market place and what could be the key to growing our concept is handicapped before it begins. </p>
<p>Although we take a hit financially each month because we are forced to borrow the money, we have successfully negotiated with an online presence that currently sells out every month, year round for their current Alcatraz providers.  The demand on their site is so strong that they believe they will be able to do the same for us.  If we did not have to pay the additional $10 vig on a $28 ticket, it would make the difference for us and we would be able to survive and prosper amongst the competition.</p>
<p>Your help (and no donation is too small) will help us to change the way visitors experience San Francisco. You can help us to show an authentic city to those that seek it. If you are tired of the pre-packaged and artificial experience that is selected for you and presented to you instead of real choice and real people, you can make a difference right now.</p>

Traditionally, Seh~haw is used to <strong>promote digestion, quality of sleep, anti-aging, weight control and physical well-being.</strong> The leaves of this traditional bush tea yield a rich golden infusion. Unsweetened, Seh~haw's flavor is reminiscent of a cross between a ripe puerh tea and South African rooibos, but with a taste that is uniquely West African.

About Saafara: From Ismael Diagne, Founder of Saafara Herbal Teas:""I am not reinventing tea, I am bringing you new exceptional tastes and flavors. Something that you haven't experienced yet. Simple and delicious. As a native of Senegal, I grew up drinking Seh~haw and other West African infusions such as Savanna Mint every day, while White Hibiscus flower was served as a refreshment after a meal. I am a big tea lover and I didn't want to be limited to the tea choices available in the U.S market today. Any time I step into a tea store, I see the same ingredients in a different canister or box. Africa has more than 10,000 herbal infusions, but only 4 or 5 are known and sold in the U.S market today. We can buy Rooibos and Honeybush from South Africa and Lipton brand tea, harvested in Kenya, to name a few. But West African flavors are unavailable in the market. And that 's what make Saafara teas unique!!!These herbs only grow in West Africa, and for the first time in the US, we are bringing you 100% Senegalese infusions. I would like to share with you the flavors that I am proud to serve my guests.""Our Mission:Saafara's mission is to be the leading distributor of premium healthy herbal teas from West Africa. By focusing on its brand name definition: solution, cure or holy water, Saafara seeks to innovate the herbal tea market by exceeding the minimum acceptable quality standards and by providing delicious new flavors.Saafara pledges to support the women harvesters in West Africa by aiding their communities with the means to access potable water facilities and acceptable delivery rooms with clean beds and linens. $0.25 from every box purchase will go to these West African communities in need.Our Objective:

awesome time in gaming. They were a time when gameplay was still important and unique ideas ruled the gaming world.</p><p>There were tons of 

real gems out there and amongst those was a business simulation game about making cars, called <i>Detroit</i>. It had a unique approach, 

replacing the concept of researching pre-existing car bodies with a way to put your cars together from different front, middle and rear 

sections, giving you control over the looks of your virtual product.<br/></p><p>When I was playing this game again, feeling somewhat

This is essentially the same body generation 2 car, done in v0.26 and redone in the current (soon to be released) v0.32. (Aside from the 

background this looks the same in v0.30 and v0.31.). The fact that I could concentrate and work uninterrupted for two days instead of 

dragging the same development out over approximately 2 weeks have allowed me to refine the new editor a lot more. The original plan was to 

add the new body generation 3 (not shown here, but it is in v0.30+) and the components.<br/><b>The rest of the much more refined look, including an internal revamp that allows me to add future body generations MUCH faster, was made 

possible with the contribution of just 126 € (a fraction of the goal) by a total of 11 people.</b> Interestingly enough - most of these 

people where existing players who had already purchased the game before, the same is true for the current campaign. This shows just how 

confident the existing players are. Some of them - like Rudolf Pietzsch, who has made a contributin of 100 € to the new campaign, have been 

with the game since it began. In fact Rudolf was one of the first 10 people to buy it in early 2012.<p></p>
<p></p><h3>So what does this mean for you?</h3>
If you decide to contribute to this campaign you can be sure that you are giving your money to a living and breathing project that has been 

constantly evolving for more than 3 years and will continue to do so - no matter how this campaign turns out. It just suffers from a lack of 

exposure so far. The difference is, that with your help the game can evolve quicker and become much better and much more refined, as you have 

seen on the above comparison screen shot, which will also allow the game to gather a larger fanbase much faster.<br/>
As a matter of fact: If you are an active crowdfunder than you have probably seen many gaming projects whose quality made huge leaps once 

enough funding was present to allow the developers to work fulltime on their game.<br/><b>The ultimate goal of this campaign is to finance the fulltime development of <i>Cars Incorporated</i> for at least 2 month.</b> This will 

allow me to make the move to v0.40, which will amongst other things add a level of (completely optional) social integration to hopefully help 

finance the rest of the way.<p></p>

has been made Cars Incorporated still requires a lot of time and exposure, so the overall goal of the campaign is to raise enough funds to 

help the game on the way to it's next big step, the release of v0.4x, as well as add some basic funding for doing limited advertising.<br/>The 

result will be that v0.40 will arrive a lot faster than it would without this funding, as I can work fulltime FOR YOU and perhaps it will 

even cross the threshold of making enough to finance it's own development with v0.40. And I since I can already focus a lot more on smaller 

details until then the game will also have a better implementation of the features - if the initial goal is met.<br/><br/>The initial target is 

set at 2600 €. This sum will give me the extra spare time to work on the game in full time for at least two months by giving me a basic 

salary of 800-900 €, covering my basic living needs like food, shelter and electricity. Of course this is not a lot to live on in the long 

run - but it is enough to help me get the time I need to kick the development into a higher gear.<br/>The remaining part of the contributions 

raised will cover the Indiegogo- and PayPal-fees (est 250 €), pay the game's musician Martin Herrmann his share (~ 250 €) and add a small 

budget of around 250-300 € for marketing on facebook and covering initial cost of putting the game into the Steam greenlight 

program.<br/><p><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/198149/files/20131114160738-Image10.png?1384474058"" hspace=""5"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>~ 250 € Fees (PayPal and Indiegogo)<br/>~ 250 € Music (Salary for Martin Herrmann)<br/>~ 250-

Incorporated was written on August 20th, 2010 - 3 years, 3 months and 4 days before the start of this campaign. During that time I logged 

1330 hours of work, bringing the game to (very) roughly 50% complete as of November 24th, 2013.<p>This means that if I continue at this pace 

the game will be completed around 2017, with most of that year being the beta phase.</p><p>YOUR SUPPORT can help me cut this time down A LOT. 

1330 hours in full-time-months of 160-170 hours a month would equal about 8 months of work so far and if I was able to put this kind of hours 

into the game from now on with the appropriate funds it would be completed and ready to be played by you in it's entirety by fall 2014, 

probably earlier as I can stay more focused and will most likely work longer than 8 hours a day anyway.</p><p>Adding to that the additional 

funding can potentially make it possible to create the intended add-on that would allow you to drive your own cars. So help me get this game

it gets made.<br/><b>Included in: </b>All perks 10 € or above with the exception of the Upgrade perks (these are intended for people who already own the 

game.<br/><b>Expected delivery: </b>Within 24 hours of your contribution.
<h3>Boxed copy</h3>
This is an add-on to the digital copy that will also give you the game on a regular disc in a DVD keepcase to add to your collection. This 

package will be professionally produced by a CD manufacturing company. At least 500 will be made and offered for sale once the game is 

completed.

The date can currently only be given as <i>when it's done</i> and depends 

heavily on the funding status. Once I can work fulltime on the game it should be completed in less then one year, however without proper 

funding I expect this to take up to three years.
<h3>The Inner Circle</h3>
This will give you the title ""The Inner Circle"" on the game's message board and more importantly access to a dedicated area on the board 

where you can find current in-development versions. These range from mini-updates over new features in testing all the way to experimental 

builds. You can be amongst the first to try out all new features and give your feedback to the developer.<br/><b>Included in: </b>All perks 50 € or above<br/><b>Expected delivery: </b>Within 24 hours of your contribution.

car 100 times"", ""build a car with component x"" or ""build an engine with x hp"". I will work with you to get your story into the game.<br/><b>Note: </b>Your story HAS TO BE approved by me in order to avoid misuse, spamming or any illegal activities.<br/><b>Included in: </b> The perk Your Story only, limited to 10.<br/><b>Expected delivery: </b>With the release of v0.40. The exact timefram depends on the funding from this campaign and other sources. This 

will probably be in the summer of 2014, successful funding can reduce the development time to approx. 2 months.
<h3>Be In The Game</h3>
The game currently runs with 10 default AI players which will be present in all future game sessions. Version 0.4x will introduce 

interactions with them such as contract negotiations. With this perk one of these AI players will have YOUR name and face if you provide an 

acceptable photo of yourself to be used in the game.<br/><b>Note: </b>The photo must be a portrait with a plain single colored backdrop and you would need to be dressed in a business style 

outfit.<br/><b>Included in: </b>The perk Be In The Game only.<br/><b>Expected delivery: </b>With the release of v0.40. The exact timefram depends on the funding from this campaign and other sources. This 

will probably be in the summer of 2014, successful funding can reduce the development time to approx. 2 months.
<h3>Lifetime package (box/digital)</h3>
I am a game developer at heart and as such I have many plans for future games that I will seek to make a reality after Cars Incorporated. 

Some of them even had working prototypes in the past but due to time constraints where not developed into playable versions. After Cars 

Incorporated I will have the time to work on these concepts that include several other tycoon style games, a space action/strategy mix and 

several adventures, usually with a creative twist.<br/>
With this perk you will get a copy of each and every one of them. Every game I ever make. Of course this is a slight risk for you but it 

could just as easily give you many great games for free in the future.<br/><b>Note:</b> Depending on whether you chose the box or digital version of this perk, you will get all copies in the form associated with the 

perk if they are available as such. If they are not available in the form chosen you will still get the game in whatever form they will be 

released in. For example: If you select the box version you will get all my future games boxed if they are produced that way. Any game that 

is not produced in a box you will receive as a digital copy.<br/><b>Included in: </b>Lifetime package (digital/box) only<br/><b>Expected delivery: </b>At various points during the time that you and me are both alive ;-)
<h3>The Dedicated One</h3>
This is for you if you are either crazy enough or wealthy and generous enough to finance the remaining development of the game (sans add-on). 

 You will get a 130x130 pixel sponsor slot on the title screen in which your logo will be displayed with a link to your website and the text 

Sponsored by.<br/><b>Note:</b> Both the picture and the website must be legally yours and may not contain any illegal or offensive content and may not be 

political or religious. Please contact me for approval if you are unsure that your website is acceptable.<br/><b>Included in:</b> The perk The Dedicated One only, limited to 1.<br/><b>Expected delivery: </b>This will be worked into the next reachable release after you have provided the materials. With that amount of 

funds that will likely be less then 1 or 2 weeks away from the time of your contribution.

großartige Zeit für Spieler. Sie waren eine Zeit in der das Gameplay noch wichtig war und einzigartige Ideen die Spielewelt 

bestimmten.</p><p>Es gab Unmengen echter Juwelen auf dem Markt und unter diesen befand sich eine Wirtschafts-Simulation in der es um Autos 

ging. Ihr Name war <i>Rüsselsheim</i> oder <i>Detroit</i> im Englischen. Sie hatte einen einzigartigen Ansatz und ersetzte das Konzept der 

Erforschung vorgegebener Karosserien mit einer Möglichkeit eigene Autos aus verschiedenen Vorder-, Mittel- und Endteilen zusammenzusetzen und 

gab einem damit eine Kontrolle darüber wie das eigene, virtuelle Produkt aussah.<br/></p><p>Als ich dieses Spiel nun mit nostalgischen 

Gefühlen im August 2010 wieder spielte, dachte ich darüber nach, wie man dieses Konzept in der heutigen Zeit weiterführen konnte. Und als ich 

mehr und mehr Ideen hatte und ein ganzes Spiel in meinem Verstand wuchs, began ich dieses Spiel zu entwickeln... <i>Cars 

Incorporated</i>.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/197969/files/20131114144105-splash.png?%0D%0A%0D%0A1384468865"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Nach einer Demo des ursprünglichen Karosserie-Editors veröffentlichte ich die erste spielbare Alpha-Version schließlich am 

28. November 2011. Seitdem ist das Spiel immer weiter gewachsen und zählt inzwischen 16 veröffentlichte Versionen. Version 0.32, die gegen 

Ende der Kampagne kommen wird, ist dann die 17te.
<p>Bisher hat das Spiel über 100 registrierte Spieler aus mehr als 20 verschiedenen Ländern, die die Einzigartigkeit dieses Spiels lieben und 

das Spiel als süchtig machend ansehen. Auch wurde ihm schon wiederholt nachgesagt, dass es stabiler läuft als so manche Beta-Version - und 

das trotz des fortwährenden Alpha-Statuses.</p><p>Wenn Sie das Spiel gerne einmal selbst ausprobieren möchten, lade ich Sie herzlich ein die 

folgende voll spielbare Demo direkt herunterzuladen und die Spieljahre 1900-1905 auszuprobieren - oder die gesamte aktuelle Spielzeit von 

1895-1950 zu spielen, sofern Sie das Spiel kaufen oder diese Kampagne für einen entsprechenden Perk unterstützen.</p><center>

Incorporated</b> hat schon einen weiten Weg hinter sich seit die Entwicklung vor mehr als 3 Jahren angefangen hat. Bis jetzt wurden alle 

Kosten des Projekts von mir und dem geringen Einkommen durch das Spiel finanziert und die eigentliche Entwicklung fand <i>fast </i> 

ausschließlich in meiner Freizeit statt.<br/>
Ich rede von <i>fast</i> weil ein <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/cars-incorporated"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">vorheriger Versuch</a> hier 

auf Indiegogo genug finanzielle Mittel erreicht hat um mir etwa 2 Vollzeit-Arbeitstage zu ermöglichen, die ich nicht anderweitig benutzen 

musste um das Geld zum Leben zu erarbeiten. Das Resultat war eine komplette Überholung des Herzens des Spiels: Dem Karosserie-Editor.
</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.cars-inc-game.com/images/screens/v03/140101-01.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
Dies ist im Prinzip dasselbe Auto der 2. Karosserie-Generation, einmal in Version 0.26 und neu erstellt in der aktuellen (bald 

veröffentlichten) Version 0.32. (Abgesehen vom Hintergrund sieht dieser Bildschirm in v0.32 genauso aus wie in v0.30 und 0.31.) Die Tatsache, 

dass ich für 2 Tage konzentriert und ungestört arbeiten konnte, anstatt dieselbe Entwicklung über 2 Wochen hinzuziehen, hat mir erlaubt, den 

Editor wesentlich weiter zu entwickeln als es ohne diese durchgängigen Tage möglich gewesen wäre. Der ursprüngliche Plan sah vor, die 

Karosserie-Generation 3 (hier nicht gezeigt, aber sie ist seit Version 0.30 enthalten) hinzuzufügen, ebenso wie die Komponenten.<br/><b>Der Rest des deutlich verschönerten Aussehens, ebenso wie interne Verbesserungen, die das zukünftige Hinzufügen neuer Karosserie-

Generationen wesentlich schneller macht, wurde ermöglicht durch Beiträge in Höhe von gerade einmal 126 € (einem Bruchteil des Ziels) von 

insgesamt 11 Unterstützern.</b> Interessanterweise waren die meisten dieser Leute bereits zuvor Spieler, die das Spiel bereits gekauft hatten 

und auch bei der aktuellen Kampagne ist es so. Dies zeigt, wieviel den existierenden Spielern an der Entwicklung dieses Projekts liegt und 

wieviel Vertrauen sie in die fortgesetzte Entwicklung haben. Einige dieser Spieler - wie Rudolf Pietzsch, der bereits 100 € zur neuen 

Kampagne beigtragen hat, waren schon von Anfang an bei dem Spiel dabei.  In der Tat gehört Rudolf zu den ersten 10, die das Spiel Anfang 2012 

gekauft haben.<p></p>
<p></p><h3>Was bedeutet das für Sie?</h3>
Wenn Sie sich entscheiden, zu dieser Kampagne beizutragen, so können Sie sicher sein, dass Sie zu einem lebenden, atmenden Projekt beitragen, 

das sich bereits seit über 3 Jahren immer weiter entwickelt und dies auch in Zukunft tun wird - unabhängig davon, ob diese Kampagne ihr Ziel 

erreicht. Bisher leidet das Projekt nur unter mangelnder Bekanntheit. Der Unterschied ist, dass sich das Spiel mit Ihrer Hilfe wesentlich 

schneller, besser und mit einer größeren Liebe zum Detail entwickeln kann - wie Sie in obigem Screenshot bereits gesehen haben. Dadurch kann 

das Spiel auch wesentlich schneller eine größere Fan-Basis generieren.<br/>
Tatsache ist: Wenn Sie ein aktiver Unterstützer von Schwarmfinanzierungsprojekten sind, dann haben Sie vermutlich schon bei anderen Projekten 

gesehen, wie die Qualität eines Spiels schlagartig angestiegen ist, in dem Moment, in dem die Entwickler das Geld zur Verfügung hatten um in 

Vollzeit daran zu arbeiten.<br/><b>Das erklärte Ziel dieser Kampagne ist es, die Vollzeit-Entwicklung von <i>Cars Incorporated</i> für mindestens 2 Monate zu 

ermöglichen.</b> Dies wird den Sprung zur Version 0.40 ermöglichen, die unter anderem (natürliche optionale) soziale Integration mitbringen 

wird, die hoffentlich die nötigen Mittel bringen werden um den Rest des Weges zu finanzieren.<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.cars-inc-game.com/images/screens/v03/140101-02.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Sie können einen Blick auf den allgemeinen Versionsplan der großen Erweiterungen <a href=""http://cars-inc-game.com/index.php/de/de-dev"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">auf der Homepage des Spiels</a> werfen.</p>
<p><a name=""dfunding"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.cars-inc-game.com/images/promo/indie2fundD.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>Selbst mit all den Fortschritten 

die das Spiel erreicht hat, benötigt es immer noch viel Entwicklungszeit und eine größere Bekanntheit. Deshalb ist das Gesamtziel dieser 

Kampagne genug finanzielle Mittel zu erhalten um dem Spiel bei seinem Weg zur nächsten großen Version 0.40 zu helfen und zusätzlich etwas 

Geld für kleinere Werbemaßnahmen zu erhalten. <br/>
Das Resultat wird sein, dass Version 0.40 sehr viel früher fertig gestellt sein wird, da ich Vollzeit FÜR SIE arbeiten kann und evtl. wird 

dies sogar dabei helfen, die Schwelle dahin zu überschreiten, dass das Spiel seine restliche Entwicklung mit Version 0.40 selbst finanzieren 

kann. Und da ich mich mehr auf kleinere Details konzentrieren kann, werden die neuen und erweiterten Funktionen auch wesentlich 

ausgeklügelter sein - wenn das Ziel der Kampagne erreicht wird.<br/><br/>
Das angepeilte Ziel liegt zunächst bei 2600 €. Diese Summe ermöglicht es mir für mindestens 2 Monate in Vollzeit an dem Spiel zu arbeiten, 

indem es mir ein ""Gehalt"" von etwa 800-900 € gibt, die meine grundsätzlichen Kosten wie Wohnung, Nahrung und Energie abdecken. Natürlich ist 

das nicht viel um auf Dauer davon zu leben - aber es ist genug um mir die Zeit freizumachen die ich brauche um die Entwicklung auf einer 

höheren Stufe fortzusetzen. <br/>
Der verbleibende Teil der erzielten Mittel wird die Indiegogo- und die PayPal-Gebühren abdecken (geschätzt 250 €), dem Musiker des Spiels, 

Martin Herrmann, seinen Anteil bezahlen (~ 250 €) und ein kleines Werbebudget von etwa 250-300 € ermöglichen um auf Facebook zu werben und 

die Einstiegskosten des Steam Greenlight Programms zu begleichen.<br/><p><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/198149/files/20131114160738-Image10.png?1384474058"" hspace=""5"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>~ 250 € Gebühren (PayPal und Indiegogo)<br/>~ 250 € Musik (Anteil von Martin Herrmann)<br/>~ 250-300 €

<p>Gelder die darüber hinaus eingenommen werden, werden in annähernd derselben Verteilung verwendet, aber ich werde noch entsprechende 

Stretch-Goals hinzufügen, sollte es soweit kommen.</p><p>Was also können die Mittel aus dieser Kampagne und weiteren Verkäufen erreichen?

<br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/219927/files/20131124100558-Image2.png?1385316358"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Die 

allererste Zeile Programmcode für Cars Incorporated wurde am 20. August 2010 geschrieben - 3 Jahre, 3 Monate und 4 Tage vor dem Start dieser 

Kampagne. In dieser Zeit habe ich etwa 1330 Stunden Arbeit protokolliert und das Spiel zu etwa 50 % fertig gestellt. (Stand 24.11.13)<p>Das 

bedeutet, dass das Spiel etwa im Jahr 2017 fertig gestellt sein wird, wenn das Tempo so bleibt wie bisher, wobei der Großteil des letzten 

Jahres von der Beta-Phase eingenommen werden wird. </p><p>IHRE UNTERSTÜTZUNG kann mir helfen diese Zeit UM EINIGES zu verkürzen.  1330 

Stunden währen bei einer normalen Vollzeitbeschäftigung von 160-170 Stunden im Monat nur etwa 8 Monate und wenn ich ab sofort diese Menge an 

Zeit in das Spiel stecken könnte, wäre es bereits im Herbst 2014 fertig gestellt und könnte von Ihnen im völlständigen Zustand gespielt 

werden. Möglicherweise sogar früher, da ich wahrscheinlich mehr als die üblichen 8 Stunden am Tag daran arbeiten werde.</p><p>Zusätzlich kann 

eine Verbesserung der finanziellen Situation der Entwicklung die Erstellung des geplanten Add-Ons ermöglichen, dass es Ihnen möglichen machen

<h3>Lebenslanges Paket (box/digital)</h3>
Ich bin im Herzen ein Spieleentwickler und als solcher habe ich viele Pläne für zukünftige Spiele die ich Stück für Stück nach der

aber auf Grund von Zeitmangel nie zu einem Spiel weiterentwickelt. Nach Cars Incorporated werde ich die Zeit haben an diesen Konzepten zu 

arbeiten. Sie enthalten einige weitere Wirtschaftssimulationen, einen Weltraum Action/Strategie-Mix und einige Adventures, gewöhnlich mit 

einem Kern, der es Ihnen erlauben wird Ihre eigene Kreativität auszuleben.<br/>
Mit diesem Perk erhalten Sie eine Kopie von jedem einzelnen dieser Spiele, sobald sie erscheinen. Jedes Spiel, dass ich jemals machen werde. 

Sicher ist das ein kleines Risiko für Sie, es kann Ihnen aber auch genauso gut viele tolle Spiele kostenlos in der Zukunft bringen.<br/><b>Hinweis:</b> Sie erhalten die Spiele in der Form die durch den jeweiligen Perk bestimmt wird, also entweder digital (als Download) oder 

box (in einer Verkaufsverpackung). Sollte ein Spiel in der jeweiligen Form nicht verfügbar sein erhalten Sie es in der jeweils verfügbaren

dass Ihre Seite akzeptabel ist.<br/><b>Enthalten in</b> dem Perk ""The Dedicated One"" und nur da, limitiert auf 1.<br/><b>Lieferung: </b>Dies wird in die nächste erreichbare Version eingearbeitet nachdem Sie die nötigen Materialien zur Verfügung gestellt

Index:   Introduction   Be a part of it   The 

funding   Referral contest
The 90's were an 

awesome time in gaming. They were a time when gameplay was still important and unique ideas ruled the gaming world.There were tons of 

real gems out there and amongst those was a business simulation game about making cars, called Detroit. It had a unique approach, 

replacing the concept of researching pre-existing car bodies with a way to put your cars together from different front, middle and rear 

sections, giving you control over the looks of your virtual product.When I was playing this game again, feeling somewhat 

nostalgic, back in august of 2010 I started thinking about where this concept could go in modern times and when I got more and more ideas and 

a whole game grew in my mind I started to develop that game... Cars Incorporated.After a demo of the original body 

editor I released the first playable alpha version on November 28th, 2011. The game has been growing eversince, counting a history of 16 

released versions with v0.32, comaing as the 17th, in the final days of the campaign. So far the game has over 100 registered players from 

more than 20 different nations, who appreciate the uniqueness and praise the game as addicting and - despite it's ongoing alpha state - as 

more stable than most beta versions.If you want to try it for yourself you can download a fully playable demo right away and play 

through the years 1900-1905 - or 1895-1950 if you register or support this campaign for an appropriate perk.
(Version 0.31, Windows, English/German, 27.0 MB)
Just keep in mind that there is a lot more to come for 

this game - and you can help make that happen.Cars 

Incorporated has come a very long way since development started more than 3 years ago. Up until now all the costs of the project have 

been covered by me personally and from the small income the game has been generating, all the development occured almost completely in my 

spare time.
I'm saying almost because a previous attempt here on 

Indiegogo has generated enough funds to give me approximately 2 full days of development time that I did not have to use otherwise to earn 

the money to live. The result was a complete overhaul of the heart of the game: The body editor.

This is essentially the same body generation 2 car, done in v0.26 and redone in the current (soon to be released) v0.32. (Aside from the 

background this looks the same in v0.30 and v0.31.). The fact that I could concentrate and work uninterrupted for two days instead of 

dragging the same development out over approximately 2 weeks have allowed me to refine the new editor a lot more. The original plan was to 

add the new body generation 3 (not shown here, but it is in v0.30+) and the components.The rest of the much more refined look, including an internal revamp that allows me to add future body generations MUCH faster, was made 

possible with the contribution of just 126 € (a fraction of the goal) by a total of 11 people. Interestingly enough - most of these 

people where existing players who had already purchased the game before, the same is true for the current campaign. This shows just how 

confident the existing players are. Some of them - like Rudolf Pietzsch, who has made a contributin of 100 € to the new campaign, have been 

with the game since it began. In fact Rudolf was one of the first 10 people to buy it in early 2012.
So what does this mean for you?
If you decide to contribute to this campaign you can be sure that you are giving your money to a living and breathing project that has been 

constantly evolving for more than 3 years and will continue to do so - no matter how this campaign turns out. It just suffers from a lack of 

exposure so far. The difference is, that with your help the game can evolve quicker and become much better and much more refined, as you have 

seen on the above comparison screen shot, which will also allow the game to gather a larger fanbase much faster.
As a matter of fact: If you are an active crowdfunder than you have probably seen many gaming projects whose quality made huge leaps once 

enough funding was present to allow the developers to work fulltime on their game.The ultimate goal of this campaign is to finance the fulltime development of Cars Incorporated for at least 2 month. This will 

allow me to make the move to v0.40, which will amongst other things add a level of (completely optional) social integration to hopefully help 

finance the rest of the way.

You can take a look at the general version roadmap on the game's 

homepage.
Even with all the progress that 

has been made Cars Incorporated still requires a lot of time and exposure, so the overall goal of the campaign is to raise enough funds to 

help the game on the way to it's next big step, the release of v0.4x, as well as add some basic funding for doing limited advertising.The 

result will be that v0.40 will arrive a lot faster than it would without this funding, as I can work fulltime FOR YOU and perhaps it will 

even cross the threshold of making enough to finance it's own development with v0.40. And I since I can already focus a lot more on smaller 

details until then the game will also have a better implementation of the features - if the initial goal is met.The initial target is 

set at 2600 €. This sum will give me the extra spare time to work on the game in full time for at least two months by giving me a basic 

salary of 800-900 €, covering my basic living needs like food, shelter and electricity. Of course this is not a lot to live on in the long 

run - but it is enough to help me get the time I need to kick the development into a higher gear.The remaining part of the contributions 

raised will cover the Indiegogo- and PayPal-fees (est 250 €), pay the game's musician Martin Herrmann his share (~ 250 €) and add a small 

budget of around 250-300 € for marketing on facebook and covering initial cost of putting the game into the Steam greenlight 

program.~ 250 € Fees (PayPal and Indiegogo)~ 250 € Music (Salary for Martin Herrmann)~ 250-

300 € Marketing~ 1800 € DevelopmentAmounts raised beyond that will give me additional 

development time and will be shared at roughly the same distribution), but when the time comes I will add appropriate stretch goals.So 

what can the funding raised from this campaign and continuing sales do?The very first line of code for Cars 

Incorporated was written on August 20th, 2010 - 3 years, 3 months and 4 days before the start of this campaign. During that time I logged 

1330 hours of work, bringing the game to (very) roughly 50% complete as of November 24th, 2013.This means that if I continue at this pace 

the game will be completed around 2017, with most of that year being the beta phase.YOUR SUPPORT can help me cut this time down A LOT. 

1330 hours in full-time-months of 160-170 hours a month would equal about 8 months of work so far and if I was able to put this kind of hours 

into the game from now on with the appropriate funds it would be completed and ready to be played by you in it's entirety by fall 2014, 

probably earlier as I can stay more focused and will most likely work longer than 8 hours a day anyway.Adding to that the additional 

funding can potentially make it possible to create the intended add-on that would allow you to drive your own cars. So help me get this game 

going in the right direction by contributing and sharing the word today.


Cars Incorporated offers several rewards for contributing and helping to get the project into a higher gear. The following perks are 

available which can be selected to the right. Just select your perk, click the gray box with it to the right and follow the instructions to

interactions with them such as contract negotiations. With this perk one of these AI players will have YOUR name and face if you provide an

outfit.Included in: The perk Be In The Game only.Expected delivery: With the release of v0.40. The exact timefram depends on the funding from this campaign and other sources. This 

will probably be in the summer of 2014, successful funding can reduce the development time to approx. 2 months.
Lifetime package (box/digital)
I am a game developer at heart and as such I have many plans for future games that I will seek to make a reality after Cars Incorporated. 

Some of them even had working prototypes in the past but due to time constraints where not developed into playable versions. After Cars 

Incorporated I will have the time to work on these concepts that include several other tycoon style games, a space action/strategy mix and 

several adventures, usually with a creative twist.
With this perk you will get a copy of each and every one of them. Every game I ever make. Of course this is a slight risk for you but it 

could just as easily give you many great games for free in the future.Note: Depending on whether you chose the box or digital version of this perk, you will get all copies in the form associated with the 

perk if they are available as such. If they are not available in the form chosen you will still get the game in whatever form they will be 

released in. For example: If you select the box version you will get all my future games boxed if they are produced that way. Any game that 

is not produced in a box you will receive as a digital copy.Included in: Lifetime package (digital/box) onlyExpected delivery: At various points during the time that you and me are both alive ;-)
The Dedicated One
This is for you if you are either crazy enough or wealthy and generous enough to finance the remaining development of the game (sans add-on). 

 You will get a 130x130 pixel sponsor slot on the title screen in which your logo will be displayed with a link to your website and the text 

Sponsored by.Note: Both the picture and the website must be legally yours and may not contain any illegal or offensive content and may not be 

political or religious. Please contact me for approval if you are unsure that your website is acceptable.Included in: The perk The Dedicated One only, limited to 1.Expected delivery: This will be worked into the next reachable release after you have provided the materials. With that amount of 

funds that will likely be less then 1 or 2 weeks away from the time of your contribution.

Even without 
contributing to this campaign directly you can support Cars Incorporated by 
simply making people aware of it - a lack of exposure is easily the biggest problem the game is facing aside from having no real funding. And 

you can even win the game in digital and boxed versions, T-Shirts, access to development steps 
between releases and you can even become a part of the game yourself.All you have to do is use the tools provided by Indiegogo further up 
on this page to promote this campaign. If you are logged in when doing 
so Indiegogo can track how many people you send here. Just be sure to 
send them here, not to the game's homepage as that can not be counted by
 Indiegogo.
For each referral (unique visitor) you will receive 1 point. Every 
Euro contributed by one of your referrals (limited to those Indiegogo 
could track) will give you 5 points. The 5 highest ranking people at the
 end of the campaign will receive the following prices:

immediate alpha-access, an autographed boxed copy with your key once the
 game is completed, access to the development versions, a cool

Finanzierung   Der Wettbewerb
Die 90er waren eine 

großartige Zeit für Spieler. Sie waren eine Zeit in der das Gameplay noch wichtig war und einzigartige Ideen die Spielewelt 

bestimmten.Es gab Unmengen echter Juwelen auf dem Markt und unter diesen befand sich eine Wirtschafts-Simulation in der es um Autos 

ging. Ihr Name war Rüsselsheim oder Detroit im Englischen. Sie hatte einen einzigartigen Ansatz und ersetzte das Konzept der 

Erforschung vorgegebener Karosserien mit einer Möglichkeit eigene Autos aus verschiedenen Vorder-, Mittel- und Endteilen zusammenzusetzen und 

gab einem damit eine Kontrolle darüber wie das eigene, virtuelle Produkt aussah.Als ich dieses Spiel nun mit nostalgischen 

Gefühlen im August 2010 wieder spielte, dachte ich darüber nach, wie man dieses Konzept in der heutigen Zeit weiterführen konnte. Und als ich 

mehr und mehr Ideen hatte und ein ganzes Spiel in meinem Verstand wuchs, began ich dieses Spiel zu entwickeln... Cars 

Incorporated.Nach einer Demo des ursprünglichen Karosserie-Editors veröffentlichte ich die erste spielbare Alpha-Version schließlich am 

28. November 2011. Seitdem ist das Spiel immer weiter gewachsen und zählt inzwischen 16 veröffentlichte Versionen. Version 0.32, die gegen 

Ende der Kampagne kommen wird, ist dann die 17te.
Bisher hat das Spiel über 100 registrierte Spieler aus mehr als 20 verschiedenen Ländern, die die Einzigartigkeit dieses Spiels lieben und 

das Spiel als süchtig machend ansehen. Auch wurde ihm schon wiederholt nachgesagt, dass es stabiler läuft als so manche Beta-Version - und 

das trotz des fortwährenden Alpha-Statuses.Wenn Sie das Spiel gerne einmal selbst ausprobieren möchten, lade ich Sie herzlich ein die 

folgende voll spielbare Demo direkt herunterzuladen und die Spieljahre 1900-1905 auszuprobieren - oder die gesamte aktuelle Spielzeit von 

1895-1950 zu spielen, sofern Sie das Spiel kaufen oder diese Kampagne für einen entsprechenden Perk unterstützen.
(Version 0.31, Windows, Englisch/Deutsch, 27.0 MB)
Behalten Sie dabei nur im Hinterkopf, dass noch viele 

Funktionen zu dem Spiel hinzukommen werden - und Sie können dabei mithelfen.
Cars 

Incorporated hat schon einen weiten Weg hinter sich seit die Entwicklung vor mehr als 3 Jahren angefangen hat. Bis jetzt wurden alle 

Kosten des Projekts von mir und dem geringen Einkommen durch das Spiel finanziert und die eigentliche Entwicklung fand fast  

ausschließlich in meiner Freizeit statt.
Ich rede von fast weil ein vorheriger Versuch hier 

auf Indiegogo genug finanzielle Mittel erreicht hat um mir etwa 2 Vollzeit-Arbeitstage zu ermöglichen, die ich nicht anderweitig benutzen 

musste um das Geld zum Leben zu erarbeiten. Das Resultat war eine komplette Überholung des Herzens des Spiels: Dem Karosserie-Editor.

Dies ist im Prinzip dasselbe Auto der 2. Karosserie-Generation, einmal in Version 0.26 und neu erstellt in der aktuellen (bald 

veröffentlichten) Version 0.32. (Abgesehen vom Hintergrund sieht dieser Bildschirm in v0.32 genauso aus wie in v0.30 und 0.31.) Die Tatsache, 

dass ich für 2 Tage konzentriert und ungestört arbeiten konnte, anstatt dieselbe Entwicklung über 2 Wochen hinzuziehen, hat mir erlaubt, den 

Editor wesentlich weiter zu entwickeln als es ohne diese durchgängigen Tage möglich gewesen wäre. Der ursprüngliche Plan sah vor, die 

Karosserie-Generation 3 (hier nicht gezeigt, aber sie ist seit Version 0.30 enthalten) hinzuzufügen, ebenso wie die Komponenten.Der Rest des deutlich verschönerten Aussehens, ebenso wie interne Verbesserungen, die das zukünftige Hinzufügen neuer Karosserie-

Generationen wesentlich schneller macht, wurde ermöglicht durch Beiträge in Höhe von gerade einmal 126 € (einem Bruchteil des Ziels) von 

insgesamt 11 Unterstützern. Interessanterweise waren die meisten dieser Leute bereits zuvor Spieler, die das Spiel bereits gekauft hatten 

und auch bei der aktuellen Kampagne ist es so. Dies zeigt, wieviel den existierenden Spielern an der Entwicklung dieses Projekts liegt und 

wieviel Vertrauen sie in die fortgesetzte Entwicklung haben. Einige dieser Spieler - wie Rudolf Pietzsch, der bereits 100 € zur neuen 

Kampagne beigtragen hat, waren schon von Anfang an bei dem Spiel dabei.  In der Tat gehört Rudolf zu den ersten 10, die das Spiel Anfang 2012 

gekauft haben.
Was bedeutet das für Sie?
Wenn Sie sich entscheiden, zu dieser Kampagne beizutragen, so können Sie sicher sein, dass Sie zu einem lebenden, atmenden Projekt beitragen, 

das sich bereits seit über 3 Jahren immer weiter entwickelt und dies auch in Zukunft tun wird - unabhängig davon, ob diese Kampagne ihr Ziel 

erreicht. Bisher leidet das Projekt nur unter mangelnder Bekanntheit. Der Unterschied ist, dass sich das Spiel mit Ihrer Hilfe wesentlich 

schneller, besser und mit einer größeren Liebe zum Detail entwickeln kann - wie Sie in obigem Screenshot bereits gesehen haben. Dadurch kann 

das Spiel auch wesentlich schneller eine größere Fan-Basis generieren.
Tatsache ist: Wenn Sie ein aktiver Unterstützer von Schwarmfinanzierungsprojekten sind, dann haben Sie vermutlich schon bei anderen Projekten 

gesehen, wie die Qualität eines Spiels schlagartig angestiegen ist, in dem Moment, in dem die Entwickler das Geld zur Verfügung hatten um in 

Vollzeit daran zu arbeiten.Das erklärte Ziel dieser Kampagne ist es, die Vollzeit-Entwicklung von Cars Incorporated für mindestens 2 Monate zu 

ermöglichen. Dies wird den Sprung zur Version 0.40 ermöglichen, die unter anderem (natürliche optionale) soziale Integration mitbringen 

wird, die hoffentlich die nötigen Mittel bringen werden um den Rest des Weges zu finanzieren.

Sie können einen Blick auf den allgemeinen Versionsplan der großen Erweiterungen auf der Homepage des Spiels werfen.
Selbst mit all den Fortschritten 

die das Spiel erreicht hat, benötigt es immer noch viel Entwicklungszeit und eine größere Bekanntheit. Deshalb ist das Gesamtziel dieser 

Kampagne genug finanzielle Mittel zu erhalten um dem Spiel bei seinem Weg zur nächsten großen Version 0.40 zu helfen und zusätzlich etwas 

Geld für kleinere Werbemaßnahmen zu erhalten. 
Das Resultat wird sein, dass Version 0.40 sehr viel früher fertig gestellt sein wird, da ich Vollzeit FÜR SIE arbeiten kann und evtl. wird 

dies sogar dabei helfen, die Schwelle dahin zu überschreiten, dass das Spiel seine restliche Entwicklung mit Version 0.40 selbst finanzieren 

kann. Und da ich mich mehr auf kleinere Details konzentrieren kann, werden die neuen und erweiterten Funktionen auch wesentlich 

ausgeklügelter sein - wenn das Ziel der Kampagne erreicht wird.
Das angepeilte Ziel liegt zunächst bei 2600 €. Diese Summe ermöglicht es mir für mindestens 2 Monate in Vollzeit an dem Spiel zu arbeiten, 

indem es mir ein ""Gehalt"" von etwa 800-900 € gibt, die meine grundsätzlichen Kosten wie Wohnung, Nahrung und Energie abdecken. Natürlich ist 

das nicht viel um auf Dauer davon zu leben - aber es ist genug um mir die Zeit freizumachen die ich brauche um die Entwicklung auf einer 

höheren Stufe fortzusetzen. 
Der verbleibende Teil der erzielten Mittel wird die Indiegogo- und die PayPal-Gebühren abdecken (geschätzt 250 €), dem Musiker des Spiels, 

Martin Herrmann, seinen Anteil bezahlen (~ 250 €) und ein kleines Werbebudget von etwa 250-300 € ermöglichen um auf Facebook zu werben und 

die Einstiegskosten des Steam Greenlight Programms zu begleichen.~ 250 € Gebühren (PayPal und Indiegogo)~ 250 € Musik (Anteil von Martin Herrmann)~ 250-300 € 

Werbung~ 1800 € Entwicklung
Gelder die darüber hinaus eingenommen werden, werden in annähernd derselben Verteilung verwendet, aber ich werde noch entsprechende 

Stretch-Goals hinzufügen, sollte es soweit kommen.Was also können die Mittel aus dieser Kampagne und weiteren Verkäufen erreichen?

Die 

allererste Zeile Programmcode für Cars Incorporated wurde am 20. August 2010 geschrieben - 3 Jahre, 3 Monate und 4 Tage vor dem Start dieser 

Kampagne. In dieser Zeit habe ich etwa 1330 Stunden Arbeit protokolliert und das Spiel zu etwa 50 % fertig gestellt. (Stand 24.11.13)Das 

bedeutet, dass das Spiel etwa im Jahr 2017 fertig gestellt sein wird, wenn das Tempo so bleibt wie bisher, wobei der Großteil des letzten 

Jahres von der Beta-Phase eingenommen werden wird. IHRE UNTERSTÜTZUNG kann mir helfen diese Zeit UM EINIGES zu verkürzen.  1330 

Stunden währen bei einer normalen Vollzeitbeschäftigung von 160-170 Stunden im Monat nur etwa 8 Monate und wenn ich ab sofort diese Menge an 

Zeit in das Spiel stecken könnte, wäre es bereits im Herbst 2014 fertig gestellt und könnte von Ihnen im völlständigen Zustand gespielt 

werden. Möglicherweise sogar früher, da ich wahrscheinlich mehr als die üblichen 8 Stunden am Tag daran arbeiten werde.Zusätzlich kann 

eine Verbesserung der finanziellen Situation der Entwicklung die Erstellung des geplanten Add-Ons ermöglichen, dass es Ihnen möglichen machen 

wird Ihre Autos auch selbst zu fahren. Also helfen Sie mir bitte, das Spiel in die richtige Richtung zu bewegen und unterstützen Sie die 

Kampagne finanziel oder helfen Sie, sie bekannter zu machen.

Lebenslanges Paket (box/digital)
Ich bin im Herzen ein Spieleentwickler und als solcher habe ich viele Pläne für zukünftige Spiele die ich Stück für Stück nach der 

Fertigstellung von Cars Incorporated in Angriff nehmen werden. Ein paar davon hatten funktionierende Prototypen in der Vergangenheit, wurden 

aber auf Grund von Zeitmangel nie zu einem Spiel weiterentwickelt. Nach Cars Incorporated werde ich die Zeit haben an diesen Konzepten zu 

arbeiten. Sie enthalten einige weitere Wirtschaftssimulationen, einen Weltraum Action/Strategie-Mix und einige Adventures, gewöhnlich mit 

einem Kern, der es Ihnen erlauben wird Ihre eigene Kreativität auszuleben.
Mit diesem Perk erhalten Sie eine Kopie von jedem einzelnen dieser Spiele, sobald sie erscheinen. Jedes Spiel, dass ich jemals machen werde. 

Sicher ist das ein kleines Risiko für Sie, es kann Ihnen aber auch genauso gut viele tolle Spiele kostenlos in der Zukunft bringen.Hinweis: Sie erhalten die Spiele in der Form die durch den jeweiligen Perk bestimmt wird, also entweder digital (als Download) oder 

box (in einer Verkaufsverpackung). Sollte ein Spiel in der jeweiligen Form nicht verfügbar sein erhalten Sie es in der jeweils verfügbaren 

Fassung.Enthalten in  dem Perk ""Lifetime package (digital/box)"" und nur daLieferung: Zu verschiedenen Zeitpunkten in der Zeit in der sowohl Sie, als auch ich am Leben sind ;-)
Sponsor
Dies ist für Sie wenn Sie entweder verrückt genug oder wohlhabend genug sind um die restliche Entwicklung des Spiels (ohne Add-On) zu 

bezahlen. Sie erhalten dafür einen 130x130 Pixel großen Sponsor Platz auf dem Titelbildschirm in dem Ihr Logo gezeigt wird und auf Ihre 

Webseite verlinkt, dazu der Text ""Gesponsort von"".Hinweis: Sowohl das Bild als auch die Webseite müssen Ihnen gehören oder von Ihnen vertreten werden und dürfen keine illegalen oder 

beleidigenden Inhalte zeigen, sie dürfen auch nicht politisch oder religiös sein. Bitte kontaktieren Sie mich, falls Sie nicht sicher sind, 

dass Ihre Seite akzeptabel ist.Enthalten in dem Perk ""The Dedicated One"" und nur da, limitiert auf 1.Lieferung: Dies wird in die nächste erreichbare Version eingearbeitet nachdem Sie die nötigen Materialien zur Verfügung gestellt 

haben. Mit der Menge an finanziellen Mitteln wird das wahrscheinlich weniger als 1-2 Wochen bedeuten.

Auch ohne direkt zur Kampagne 

beizutragen können Sie Cars Incorporated unterstützen, indem Sie es und die Kampagne bekannter machen - denn die mangelnde Bekanntheit ist 

das größte Problem des Spiels, abgesehen von fehlendem Budget. Und nebenbei können Sie auch noch das Spiel in digitaler und verpackter 

Version gewinnen, ebenso wie T-Shirts, Zugriff auf Entwicklungsversionen zwischen den Veröffentlichungen und Sie können sogar selbst ein Teil 

des Spiels werden.Alles was Sie dafür tun müssen, ist die Tools zu benutzen die Indiegogo auf der Startseite der Kampagne bereitstellt um sie bekannter zu 

machen. Wenn Sie eingeloggt sind während Sie das tun kann Indiegogo verfolgen wieviele Leute Sie hierher senden. Machen Sie nur solange die 

Kampagne noch läuft sicher, dass Sie sie hierher schicken und nicht auf die Homepage des Spiels, denn das kann Indiegogo nicht verfolgen.
Für jeden Referral, oder einzigartigen Besucher (im Sinne von einer einzelnen IP) erhalten Sie einen Punkt. Für jeden Euro den ein 

Besucher von Ihnen beiträgt erhalten Sie 5 Punkte - limitiert natürlich auf die, die Indiegogo zählen kann. Die 5 Personen mit den meisten 

Punkten am Ende der Kampagne erhalten folgende Preise:
1. Preis *
Sie erhalten den Perk ""Be In The Game"" kostenfrei. Dies enthält sofortigen Zugriff auf die Alpha-Version und alle folgenden Versionen, 

eine signierte, verpackte Kopie des Spiels mit Ihrem Schlüssel sobald die Version 1.0 erreicht ist, Zugriff auf die Entwicklungsversionen, 

ein cooles T-Shirt mit einem Ihrer Autos aus dem Spiel UND die Verewigung Ihres Namens und Bildes (falls gewünscht) als einer der 10 

Standard-Computer-Gegner.
2. & 3. Preis *
Sie erhalten den Perk ""The Inner Circle"" kostenfrei. Dies beinhaltet sofortigen Zugriff auf die aktuelle und alle folgenden Vollversionen

Entwicklungsversionen.
4. & 5. Preis *
Sie erhalten den Perk ""Alpha Package Supporter"" kostenfrei und damit vollen Zugriff auf die aktuelle und alle künftigen Vollversionen des 

Spiels, inkl. Add-Ons.
Ich versende reguläre Kampagnen-Updates mit dem Stand des Wettbewerbs, also stellen Sie am besten sicher, dass Sie der Kampagne 

folgen.Referral-Wettbewerb Bedingungen
* Sollte die Kampagne am Ende weniger als 500 € eingenommen haben, so können alle Preise auf den Perk ""Alpha Package Supporter"" reduziert 

werden. Unterstützer die mindestens 100 Referrals geworben haben sind davon nicht betroffen und werden auf jeden Fall mit dem vollen Preis 

belohnt, bei weniger hängt es von der Aktivität des Werbenden ab und liegt in meinem Ermessen. Bezahlte Perks werden davon selbstverständlich 

nicht berührt und werden voll erfüllt, völlig unabhängig davon wie die Kampagne ausgeht. Mitarbeiter des Projekts (David Klande, Martin 

Herrmann und bezahlte Werbe-Treibende) können selbstverständlich NICHT an dem Wettbewerb teilnehmen.Inhalt:   Einführung   Seien Sie dabei   Die

<p>All this led us to seek a solution that would provide
a valid response to each of those factors. After more than four years of
research and various tests, we have come to the conclusion that indoor
gardening is the solution to all these problems. </p>
<p><b>Climate changes that affect a good vegetable
production </b><br/>Home conditions remain the same.</p>
<p><b>GMOs increasingly present in our food without our
knowledge</b><br/>With organic farming is no longer a question of GMOs.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p align=""center""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/728970/files/20140719094226-1.png?1405788146"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>Skyrocketing costs of fruit and vegetables</b><br/>Fruits
and vegetables grow throughout the year ensuring adequate supply for each.</p>
<p><b>Increasing pollution</b><br/>Plants also consume CO2 and
contribute to the purification of the air. In addition, adequate facilities
provide air quality throughout the room and more.</p>
<p><b>The proliferation of chemtrails that discharge
pollutants into the air and the ground</b><br/>Fortunately chemtrails do not enter our
homes unless we open the windows during spraying. Their residues will not be
deposited on our cultures.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/728994/files/20140719095228-2.png?1405788748"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>Our population whose average age is higher and
higher</b><br/>People as they age are increasingly sedentary. They need an activity
and passion. Cultivating culture at home quickly becomes a passion. You will
not get bored.</p>
<p><b>The increasing number of depression and suicide cases
among our elderly</b><br/>Elderly people often feel useless. They do more long-term
projects and suddenly many lose the will to live. Gardening is increasingly the
favorite activity for these people but when winter shows up and you have to
live inside for months with nothing to do but get bored, morale no longer
holds. </p><p>Therefore this project is very important for this category of people.
Easy to learn and maintain, they can handle it throughout the year. Even people
with disabilities are able to practice indoor gardening. Moreover, it is an
activity that we expect to promote hosting institutions to provide healthy food
and especially an enjoyable activity that allows people to invest in their own
time to achieve a positive result.</p><p>This is what is lacking in our depressed
people who are dying of boredom to the point of being physically ill.</p>
<p><b>The health of humans who consume too much fast food
products</b><br/>We noticed that people who have been growing their
own fruit and vegetables consumed them with great pleasure, whereas before they
would not eat them. The amount consumed per person increases considerably when
these foods are homegrown with quality and freshness that improves health
significantly.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/729007/files/20140719095448-3.png?1405788888"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>The very marked ""living at home"" </b><br/>In the
early '90s, Ms. Faith Popcorn published a book on the new trend in living at
home without leaving except for really important reasons. At the time, people
did not believe that this trend will spread, but now with the Internet and
electronic devices, with the trend of entertaining at home, with home theater,
movies on premium channels, more people spend time at home. </p><p>Some have chosen to
live in apartments with no greenery. Nowadays, these people want a garden. They
love picking a strawberry, biting into a fresh tomato but the market is often
far away. Driving to buy some fruits and vegetables that have been transported
hundreds or even thousands of miles before reaching the table, interest very
few people. </p><p>That is why home gardening becomes important also for these people.
It is not a matter of saving money but increasing the quality of life.</p>
<p><b>The green space is increasingly restricted in our
cities</b><br/>Parks are few and overcrowded. They offer only the lawn, a few trees,
benches and gravel. It does not allow real contact with nature. Cultivating your
food, touching the plants, smelling the fresh fruits and vegetables, see it grow,
picking and cooking it, that is having a REAL contact with nature. This type of
contact that allows human beings to reconnect with life and its energies line
up with the Universal Energy.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/729018/files/20140719095746-4.png?1405789066"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>The quality of the air in homes and apartments. </b><br/>By
growing plants in the house, you enjoy the benefits offered by the plants when
they breathe. Plants recover CO2 and give off a natural scent that makes good
sense. Through well-designed facilities, even allergy sufferers are able to
cultivate it since it is possible to keep the seedlings under control and where
the air is clean.</p>
<p><b>Children who these days don't know where their food comes
from</b><br/>Your children will grow plants from seed, they will evolve to flowers
and fruits and vegetables. They will learn about pollination and why it is
necessary. Finally, they can pick their favorite fruit or vegetable and chew on
them immediately. They will always want more and you'll enjoy allowing them to
eat another vegetable or fruit without worrying about their blood sugar level or
the impact on their health.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/729030/files/20140719100157-6.png?1405789317"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>The growing seasons are too short</b><br/>In the house,
with special lighting for indoor gardening, there is a GOOD SEASON for
gardening all year round. You can even grow EXOTIC fruits and vegetables!</p>
<p><b>The growing number of inhabitants in the colder
regions</b><br/>The cost of homes have become too expensive in large cities, and the
fact is that more and more people make their living on the Internet, meaning
that rural and remote areas are becoming more popular. The difficulty lies in
the fact that these regions are often further north or south, preventing the
amateur gardener to harvest over a long period. With indoor gardening, this
problem no longer exists.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/729046/files/20140719100609-7.png?1405789569"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>As there are many methods of cultivation and facilities
of all kinds, some of which are sometimes risky, there is an urgent need for an
external and neutral organization to make the appropriate tests. </p><p>Currently,
only companies that manufacture accessories and facilities offer information
about it. We want to offer a real comparison between the different offers
currently available. We also wish to prepare alternatives to small budgets to
advise people of the solution that best fit their needs. </p>
<p><b><i>It was after these considerations that the project was
born. </i></b></p>

<p>We already have the location and the space for it. Some
renovations and alterations need to be made, before the facilities can be ready.
</p>
<p>To allow you to follow the development of operations,
the project will be divided into several stages, and you will be kept updated
if you wish, as and when the work progresses. </p>
<p>The first step is to get the renovations done. </p><p></p><p>It is very
important to achieve our goal to have the premises ready before starting the
laboratory school.</p>
<p>As it is
about creating an indoor garden, we have found that no present premises is
suitably adapted to the specific needs of the facilities required for the
project.</p>
<p>This is why
we need to achieve our goals in order to have the setup ready before we can
proceed with the installation of all equipment for indoor gardening.</p>
<p>A change of
windows is required to enable the installation of the air pipes. Installation
of a new electrical system is also necessary to meet government requirements.</p>
<p>The walls,
ceiling and floor will also need to be insulated and covered with a material that
is moisture- and mold-proof.</p>
<p>Equipment
necessary for an indoor garden does not cause such problems such as moisture
but it is prudent to provide for unforeseen circumstances. These situations
could arise if there is an equipment failure in hydroponics, for example.</p>
<p>As we are
considering the inner permaculture, there will be a pool for fish farming. There
are always potential risks to be assessed and it is necessary to prepare even
though we firmly believe that none of this will happen.</p>
<p>Changes will
be made to the water inlet and the outlet of the sewer to allow for the passage
of larger particles when the containers used for the growing crop are washed.
It might be necessary to break the cement floors and walls to install the new
piping.</p>
<p>We will
also need to install a tank to provide water to wash plants to remove undesirable
elements. The tank could be as small as a bathtub or a large container.</p>
<p>The
laboratory school will go much further than what people will do at home as we
test a lot of techniques and equipment in order to inform and educate people
about the techniques that best fit their situation.</p>
<p>It is in
this laboratory that we simulate all the possibilities and identify all the
potential problems.</p>
<p>This is why
the first step in adapting the premises to the project is vital. Without
achieving this objective, the project will encounter problems.</p>
<p><b><i>Cost: $ 12,750</i></b></p><p><b><i><br/></i></b></p>
<p>Costs of the following steps are shown for information
purposes and if this campaign raises the necessary funds, we can go much faster
in the development of the company and the start of operations. </p><p>Therefore, if
you wish to participate in all stages, it would be better to leave us an email
address that you check regularly. We will notify you of the progress of the
project and the beginning of each of the other steps. We can also inform you of
the opening of the next fundraising.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/728939/files/20140719092959-barre.png?1405787399"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Here is an overview of the following: </p>
<p><b>The second step</b> is to purchase and install the
necessary equipment. Equipment costs $ 22,000, installation costs (labor and
specialized workers) $ 7,945. </p>
<p>Total $ 29,945. </p>
<p>This cost does not represent the conventional system
that would suit a residence but several other facilities in order to test and
develop work strategies to optimize performance. </p>
<p>We have at least 4 different types of facilities (2
hydroponic and 2 soil) and will be divided to avoid the uncertainty of
assessments for each system. </p>
<p>If we receive more money than the minimum necessary,
we will increase the number of installations. </p>
<p>Our room is able to accommodate 8 installations without
any problems and we can quickly triple the usable surface over a room for more installations, on-site training and an office where the administrative and video editing work
is done. There will be only planning done there as to the steps described in
this application work.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/728940/files/20140719093035-barre.png?1405787435"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>The third step</b> involves seeding and transplant, and
the testing of aquaponics and soil gardening. This stage will cost $ 5,085. This
amount will include the purchase cost of certified organic seeds, equipment,
seed conservation in the long term, sprout ready for transplantation, land plants,
organic fertilizers and other products necessary for the implementation of the
various tests, and of course the labor required for this operation and the
video recording of all stages.

The project of a laboratory-school was born of all the
comments and requests received from several parties over the years. We
listened, we understood their concerns, their needs, their inability to find
the solution by themselves. The main irritants come from all humans’ problems. Who today does not care for the following: 

Climate changes that affect a good vegetable production 


GMOs increasingly present in our food without our knowledge 


Skyrocketing costs of fruit and vegetables 


Increasing pollution 


The proliferation of chemtrails that discharge pollutants into the air and soil 


Our population whose average age is higher and higher 


From the increasing number of depression and suicide cases among our elderly 


The health of humans who consume too much fast food products 


The very marked ""living home"" trend 


The green space that is increasingly restricted in our cities 


The air quality in homes and apartments 


Children who these days don't know where their food comes from


The growing seasons are too short 


The growing number of inhabitants in the colder regions 


and more.

The list could be much longer, alas.How do we fix it?
All this led us to seek a solution that would provide
a valid response to each of those factors. After more than four years of
research and various tests, we have come to the conclusion that indoor
gardening is the solution to all these problems. 
Climate changes that affect a good vegetable
production Home conditions remain the same.
GMOs increasingly present in our food without our
knowledgeWith organic farming is no longer a question of GMOs.Skyrocketing costs of fruit and vegetablesFruits
and vegetables grow throughout the year ensuring adequate supply for each.
Increasing pollutionPlants also consume CO2 and
contribute to the purification of the air. In addition, adequate facilities
provide air quality throughout the room and more.
The proliferation of chemtrails that discharge
pollutants into the air and the groundFortunately chemtrails do not enter our
homes unless we open the windows during spraying. Their residues will not be
deposited on our cultures.Our population whose average age is higher and
higherPeople as they age are increasingly sedentary. They need an activity
and passion. Cultivating culture at home quickly becomes a passion. You will
not get bored.
The increasing number of depression and suicide cases
among our elderlyElderly people often feel useless. They do more long-term
projects and suddenly many lose the will to live. Gardening is increasingly the
favorite activity for these people but when winter shows up and you have to
live inside for months with nothing to do but get bored, morale no longer
holds. Therefore this project is very important for this category of people.
Easy to learn and maintain, they can handle it throughout the year. Even people
with disabilities are able to practice indoor gardening. Moreover, it is an
activity that we expect to promote hosting institutions to provide healthy food
and especially an enjoyable activity that allows people to invest in their own
time to achieve a positive result.This is what is lacking in our depressed
people who are dying of boredom to the point of being physically ill.
The health of humans who consume too much fast food
productsWe noticed that people who have been growing their
own fruit and vegetables consumed them with great pleasure, whereas before they
would not eat them. The amount consumed per person increases considerably when
these foods are homegrown with quality and freshness that improves health
significantly.
The very marked ""living at home"" In the
early '90s, Ms. Faith Popcorn published a book on the new trend in living at
home without leaving except for really important reasons. At the time, people
did not believe that this trend will spread, but now with the Internet and
electronic devices, with the trend of entertaining at home, with home theater,
movies on premium channels, more people spend time at home. Some have chosen to
live in apartments with no greenery. Nowadays, these people want a garden. They
love picking a strawberry, biting into a fresh tomato but the market is often
far away. Driving to buy some fruits and vegetables that have been transported
hundreds or even thousands of miles before reaching the table, interest very
few people. That is why home gardening becomes important also for these people.
It is not a matter of saving money but increasing the quality of life.
The green space is increasingly restricted in our
citiesParks are few and overcrowded. They offer only the lawn, a few trees,
benches and gravel. It does not allow real contact with nature. Cultivating your
food, touching the plants, smelling the fresh fruits and vegetables, see it grow,
picking and cooking it, that is having a REAL contact with nature. This type of
contact that allows human beings to reconnect with life and its energies line
up with the Universal Energy.The quality of the air in homes and apartments. By
growing plants in the house, you enjoy the benefits offered by the plants when
they breathe. Plants recover CO2 and give off a natural scent that makes good
sense. Through well-designed facilities, even allergy sufferers are able to
cultivate it since it is possible to keep the seedlings under control and where
the air is clean.
Children who these days don't know where their food comes
fromYour children will grow plants from seed, they will evolve to flowers
and fruits and vegetables. They will learn about pollination and why it is
necessary. Finally, they can pick their favorite fruit or vegetable and chew on
them immediately. They will always want more and you'll enjoy allowing them to
eat another vegetable or fruit without worrying about their blood sugar level or
the impact on their health.
The growing seasons are too shortIn the house,
with special lighting for indoor gardening, there is a GOOD SEASON for
gardening all year round. You can even grow EXOTIC fruits and vegetables!
The growing number of inhabitants in the colder
regionsThe cost of homes have become too expensive in large cities, and the
fact is that more and more people make their living on the Internet, meaning
that rural and remote areas are becoming more popular. The difficulty lies in
the fact that these regions are often further north or south, preventing the
amateur gardener to harvest over a long period. With indoor gardening, this
problem no longer exists.As there are many methods of cultivation and facilities
of all kinds, some of which are sometimes risky, there is an urgent need for an
external and neutral organization to make the appropriate tests. Currently,
only companies that manufacture accessories and facilities offer information
about it. We want to offer a real comparison between the different offers
currently available. We also wish to prepare alternatives to small budgets to
advise people of the solution that best fit their needs. 
It was after these considerations that the project was
born. 
What we need to realize
We already have the location and the space for it. Some
renovations and alterations need to be made, before the facilities can be ready.

To allow you to follow the development of operations,
the project will be divided into several stages, and you will be kept updated
if you wish, as and when the work progresses. 
The first step is to get the renovations done. It is very
important to achieve our goal to have the premises ready before starting the
laboratory school.
As it is
about creating an indoor garden, we have found that no present premises is
suitably adapted to the specific needs of the facilities required for the
project.
This is why
we need to achieve our goals in order to have the setup ready before we can
proceed with the installation of all equipment for indoor gardening.
A change of
windows is required to enable the installation of the air pipes. Installation
of a new electrical system is also necessary to meet government requirements.
The walls,
ceiling and floor will also need to be insulated and covered with a material that
is moisture- and mold-proof.
Equipment
necessary for an indoor garden does not cause such problems such as moisture
but it is prudent to provide for unforeseen circumstances. These situations
could arise if there is an equipment failure in hydroponics, for example.
As we are
considering the inner permaculture, there will be a pool for fish farming. There
are always potential risks to be assessed and it is necessary to prepare even
though we firmly believe that none of this will happen.
Changes will
be made to the water inlet and the outlet of the sewer to allow for the passage
of larger particles when the containers used for the growing crop are washed.
It might be necessary to break the cement floors and walls to install the new
piping.
We will
also need to install a tank to provide water to wash plants to remove undesirable
elements. The tank could be as small as a bathtub or a large container.
The
laboratory school will go much further than what people will do at home as we
test a lot of techniques and equipment in order to inform and educate people
about the techniques that best fit their situation.
It is in
this laboratory that we simulate all the possibilities and identify all the
potential problems.
This is why
the first step in adapting the premises to the project is vital. Without
achieving this objective, the project will encounter problems.
Cost: $ 12,750
Costs of the following steps are shown for information
purposes and if this campaign raises the necessary funds, we can go much faster
in the development of the company and the start of operations. Therefore, if
you wish to participate in all stages, it would be better to leave us an email
address that you check regularly. We will notify you of the progress of the
project and the beginning of each of the other steps. We can also inform you of
the opening of the next fundraising.Here is an overview of the following: 
The second step is to purchase and install the
necessary equipment. Equipment costs $ 22,000, installation costs (labor and
specialized workers) $ 7,945. 
Total $ 29,945. 
This cost does not represent the conventional system
that would suit a residence but several other facilities in order to test and
develop work strategies to optimize performance. 
We have at least 4 different types of facilities (2
hydroponic and 2 soil) and will be divided to avoid the uncertainty of
assessments for each system. 
If we receive more money than the minimum necessary,
we will increase the number of installations. 
Our room is able to accommodate 8 installations without
any problems and we can quickly triple the usable surface over a room for more installations, on-site training and an office where the administrative and video editing work
is done. There will be only planning done there as to the steps described in
this application work.
The third step involves seeding and transplant, and
the testing of aquaponics and soil gardening. This stage will cost $ 5,085. This
amount will include the purchase cost of certified organic seeds, equipment,
seed conservation in the long term, sprout ready for transplantation, land plants,
organic fertilizers and other products necessary for the implementation of the
various tests, and of course the labor required for this operation and the
video recording of all stages. We will also begin domestic composting. The fourth step will involve the growth of plants and
their pollination as at harvest. This work requires human intervention for the
daily checks, watering as needed and pollination. The amount required is also
wages for those in charge of video production, documentation, project
management and statistics, quality control, procurement and marketing to the
next step. We estimate the cost of this phase spread over three months to be $
28,250. The fifth step will be the opening of the Education
Department. It is here that we will design the on-site training to be provided and
we will prepare the website for online purchase of video boxes. 
Costs are estimated at $ 20,340 and are mostly
reserved for the work of the webmaster and programmer, procurement and
preparation of teaching materials. The salaries of trainers and staff of the
company come from revenue from on-site registration and sales via the Internet.
The sixth step will teaches how to preserve food that
is grown. We then go into a final stage to complement the cycle of food
self-sufficiency as we teach the art of dehydration, canning, salting, and we
also explore the world of recipes to change the modern diet to improve health. 
We estimate the cost of this last step to be $ 10,400.
This investment could probably come from profits but we still prefer to provide
for it as other costs will already be supported by the revenues of the company.
As it is possible that the launch could be delayed or move faster than we
expect, we believe it is prudent to include this amount in our financial
forecast. This amount will be used to purchase specialized equipment mainly
food preservation. Labor costs should be covered by the benefits of training
already sold. 
All stages, from the first stage, will be filmed and
will provide very accurate and detailed training. 
Throughout the stages 3, 4 and 5, we will receive
students for training on site. These information are also available in video
format accompanied by documents to help provide the knowledge necessary to
reproduce the same results regardless of where the student lives on the planet.
Step 6 will be available online and on demand video only. However, we envisage,
if the need arises, renting a place for meetings for culinary education. 
Because people often prefer to order their products
from the company they trust, we plan to become custodians of commodities such
as organic fertilizers, small accessories quick wear, etc. We have not considered
this income in our calculations for the moment.A book will be published to show the public this new
way of life and how we make it accessible to all. We hope it will have a viral
effect and will increase enrollment and sales training online. 
We have the qualifications necessary for the smooth
running of this project with university training in business management,
multimedia, teaching and we already have published over 120 titles on the
Internet. 
In addition, for years, we have grown many of the
foods we consume. Our main restriction is that the gardening season extends
only over 6 months and we are part of those people who wish to grow 12 months a
year without having to move to warmer regions. 
The following are some photos of our garden. 
When the laboratory school reaches breakeven or
generates profits, we are committed to provide up to 5% of net profits of the
enterprise to help start other projects. 
Total for the implementation of the overall project: $
106,770 
Any amount received above this amount will be reserved
for the development of the second part of the space to be ready to expand as
needed. 
We believe that the development of any remaining space
before buying gardening equipment, will cost nearly $ 20,000 because it will
require more renovation.

How you can helpWe are in need of three important items; final design feedback from you, the $90,000 required to make Gunner’s Mate a reality and patience. Yes, the drawings and 3D printed prototype are a bit rough but we purposely stopped short of a final design to allow our supporters room to provide valuable input on the final product. Door Kickers to the Front!During the campaign, the Elite Door Kickers will be given the opportunity to participate in a special live web conference designed to help us put the finishing touches on the overall design. We can’t promise we’ll incorporate every suggestion, but Gunner’s Mate will go into production with your fingerprints all over the final design.How Your Contributions Will be Used





As you can see from the itemized cost breakdown above, fixed costs such as the molds, spring development and other special tooling are the lion’s share of expenses. American made quality is a worthy investment and we all want a product that can be backed with a lifetime guarantee.The other major expenses are the Variable Costs that are dependent on the response we get from the firearm's community to the Gunner's Mate offer.   Manufacturing the Gunner's Mate parts, having them assembled, and mailed out (along with the various swag) will require manpower. We also need additional funds to cover the final CAD design, packaging design, and finishing the patent. Finally, there are the fees related to running this campaign which are variable as well. It's nice to know this money will be staying in the U.S.Production Plan and Timeline
 Once the final design is settled and the funds are secured, it’s time to contract with the mold maker and have the family molds machined. We mentioned needing some patience; as this is by far the longest step in the process and could take up to 16 weeks depending upon lead times.  During this waiting period we will get the springs made, lock in a production window, have packaging designed, and tie up other loose ends. After proving the mold and materials with a small quantity run, it's time to turn out Gunner's Mates! Depending upon the generosity of our supporters and the volume of Gunner’s Mates ordered this could take a few weeks, we'll know more after the campaign. By the time the plastic injected parts arrive at the fulfillment center the springs, packaging and logo patches should already be on site ready for final assembly and shipment to our supporters. As you can see, there's a lot of moving pieces and it takes time to get a new product manufactured and into the marketplace. In our case it could take up to 20 weeks so patience isn't only a virtue patience is required.  Communications Plan

<h3><font><i>My Story</i></font></h3>
<p><font>I was raised by my grandmother. She was the classic example of a lady. The amount of poise and class she exuded has remained a constant inspiration to me. On top of that, she always looked fantastic. I passed so many hours as a child playing dress up in her clothes, and to my highest delight, putting on her make up. As I got older, I loved make up, but I struggled to understand just how girls managed to perfect their looks, how their skin was always so flawless. My sophomore year of college I entered the beauty industry with a major cosmetics company. I was hooked. I loved the ability to transform not only someone's appearance, but also their attitude about the way they looked. From healthy skin to hot pink lips, I instantly developed a strong passion for encouraging both women and men to take control of the way they wanted to look and how they wanted to feel about the way they looked. Everyone struggles with insecurities, and it is a learning process to embrace the person you are inside and out. I have reached the point in my career where I want to stretch beyond the 9-5. I want to take my knowledge of the beauty industry, make up artistry, and skin care and bring it to a one on one personal level. </font></p>

<h3><font><i>The Impact</i></font></h3>
<p><font>For me, this campaign is about sharing my love for the art of beauty, it's about helping people do more than look good, but understand that beauty goes far beyond the brush. I don't feel beautiful every day, but that is just a part of life. Without a successful campaign it may be years before I am able to successfully establish the kind of business I want, one that is dynamic, creative, provides true quality, and gives me the ability to provide my services to as many people possible. It is a strong goal of mine to partner with various women's and girl's community groups to provide an outreach to women to show them not only how they can look beautiful, but to remind them that they already are. I am committed to give 10% of whatever I raise in my campaign to an association or program which advocates for women's struggles or the under privileged ( I am totally open to suggestions on this as well, and may end up using a poll to decide which one!)</font></p>

Though I don't prefer any one brand or company, quality is important to me, and I strive to use and suggest the safest, most natural, and ecologically sound products possible. I would also like to be able to build and run a dynamic website which allows possible clients to easily contact me and understand what is I offer.

<div>In mid-2012, the three of us - Lisa Spitz, Pauline Benninga, and Thara Pillai - were having a casual conversation about the challenges that each of us had faced as women entrepreneurs.  As working mothers with six kids between us, we already knew that the traditional approach to entrepreneurship wasn't a good fit for so many women like us.  And something in that discussion clicked when we realized that there was no one-stop, <strong><em>women-focused</em></strong> site that offered networking, education, news, and an active sense of community. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>It was out of that realization that RebelWomen was born!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We started with just a blog, pushing out information about entrepreneurship to women we knew. Our reader base grew while we pooled our resources and found a stellar developer to create the first version of our website, which we are releasing in a matter of weeks from now!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>But we still have more development to do to reach our goal of providing all the features that we feel are necessary to give women entrepreneurs the support they need. That's why we launched this campaign - to raise money to develop those features! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Your contribution can help us build something even better, and to help women get the confidence, knowledge, and connections they need to create and grow a business.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<h3>Why focus on women and entrepreneurship?</h3>
<div>We know from personal experience that entrepreneurship for women often requires a slightly different approach than the traditional track. Building a business might merit the same level of atttention in a woman's life as managing a household, caregiving of children or the elderly, and devoting hours to a full-time job. It's a juggling act!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The 2010 government study, “Women-Owned Businesses in the 21st Century” reports on the demographics of women-owned businesses and specific challenges they faced, including:</div>
<p><strong>Balancing career with caregiving</strong></p>
<p>""Women continue to spend more of their time providing childcare, eldercare, spousal care and household care than their male counterparts.”</p>
<p><strong>Women do not have as much time for networking opportunities</strong></p>
<p>“Self-employed women have been found to work fewer hours than self-employed men...[W]omen provide more support for family and household responsibilities than men, and thus, have fewer available hours than men to work at their businesses.""</p>
<p><strong>Women are at a resource disadvantage in terms of…</strong></p>
<p><strong>Experience: </strong>""Past business experience is an important form of human capital for new business owners. Prior business experience and family history of business ownership have been found to increase the likelihood of becoming a business owner and to contribute to business survival and growth. Compared to female owners, male business owners typically have had more prior experience with start-ups and have been in management roles in their previous work.""</p>
<p><strong>Available Financing:  </strong>""Women-owned businesses started their firms with 64% of the capital levels of businesses owned by men.""</p>
<p><strong>We see these challenges as an opportunity! RebelWomen addresses all of these issues by bringing women entrepreneurs together to share knowledge and learn from other experts, on a schedule that works for their lives.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>Where does the money go?</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>With $3,000, we can build RebelWomen Bootcamp - a series of online learning modules that women can take over the course of a week that teaches them about building a business.  From a high-level overview to the ins and outs of incorporation, women can get the information they need in a timeframe that works for busy schedules.  The development includes both the back end framework and the front end design.</p>
<p>Even if we don't raise the entire amount, we can still build pieces of this functionality.  Every little bit helps!</p>
<p>And check out the perks available to our contributors! We've come up with some cool rewards designed by one of our co-founders, Lisa Spitz!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<div>
<p>Even if you aren't in a position to donate funds, please share this campaign with anyone who might be interested in helping women gain the confidence, knowledge, and connections they need to make the step toward entrepreneurship, or to grow their existing business in a way that works for <em>women</em>!  You can do this by forwarding the link to our campaign, or using the IndieGoGo share tools.</p>

<h2>Beer Makes us Happy</h2>
<p>We love beer. In fact, we love beer so much, we want to make more of our beer and share it with you. In all truth, our passion for beer is only rivaled by our passion for Detroit, so opening our Nano Brewery in Detroit was kind of a no-brainer.</p>
<p>Brainstorming about what we'd like to feature in our brewery has been easy. Refining that list has been the hard part.</p>
<p>What we know for sure:</p>
<p>-We're going make great beer and have an atmosphere perfect for quaffing (drinking heartily).</p>
<p>-Charitable contribution will be an integral part of our business model.</p>
<p>-We're going to make *some* impact on the community, just by opening the doors.</p>
<p>-We're going to support other small business in Detroit.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Digital Panhandling?</strong></h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>Turns out, opening a brewery is pretty effing expensive. And while banks are tripping over themselves to lend money to start-ups like this, we thought we'd take our efforts right to the people: our friends, family, and community. </p>
<p>We like to think of this akin to a Public Radio fundraiser (the NPR dorks that we are). While a bit pesky, it's definitely necessary. The main difference? We aren't going to do this twice a year in perpetuity. This is our one capital-raising effort. After that, we better make great beer - and you better drink it.</p>
<p>You could give money to a thousand different things - we know that. What does supporting Batch Brewing Company really mean?</p>
<p>-It could mean you know us, like us or love us, and want to see us manifest this dream into reality. (Ain't too proud to beg, clearly.)</p>
<p>-It means you support entrepreneurship and the continued diversification of the marketplace. (There's three $50 words in that sentence alone. I mean, come on!)</p>
<p>-It could simply mean that you love Michigan Beer and want more breweries in Detroit, especially a brewery in Corktown (Finally.)</p>
<p>-It could mean you want to see another business help strengthen Detroit, one storefront at a time.</p>
<p>-It means that you know you can support both a start-up and nonprofit organizations with one contribution.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What was that last thing you said?</h2>
<p>Clearly, we don't take ourselves too seriously. We do have a serious side, though. Seriously.</p>
<p>We're committed, not only to making great beer, but to making some small difference in our corner of the cosmos. At all times, Batch Brewing Company will have a special beer on tap called the 'Feelgood' beer. Why does it make you feel good? Well, aside from it being a unique beer sure to quench your royal fires, each beer sold from the 'Feelgood' tap will contribute $3 to charity. Every month, we'll feature a different beer and a different charity, with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society being our go-to charity for much of the year.</p>
<p>We're not a nonprofit, and we aren't pretending to be. That being said, if everyone gave a little bit, this world could be a little bit better, right? This is our little bit.</p>
<p>You want a charity that you're affiliated with to be considered for the 'Feelgood' tap? Check out our giving levels.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>How we'll use your contribution</strong></h2>
<p>Where's your money going? A fair question. If you pulled out your abacus, you'll notice our $25,000 goal is way less than the actual amount we need. We're hoping to exceed our goal, needless to say.</p>

<p><em>A knife born of great design and uncompromising craft can profoundly improve the quality of your life by making your experience of preparing food for yourself, family, and friends a pleasure beyond expectation -</em></p>
<p>My name is Adam Simha and I am an experienced, passionate, and fully commmitted maker of culinary knives (I’m also and M.I.T. graduate and James Beard Society award winner) located in Cambridge, Ma.</p>
<p>My company is called MKS Design.</p>
<p>This endeavor will be called MKS Knife (<a href=""http://www.mksknife.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.mksknife.com</a>)</p>
<p>Over the last 14 years I have desiged knives for corporate clients (like All Clad, Dexter-Russell, and Lamson and Goodnow), marketed my own ready-made line of cutlery (designed in 2005), and hand crafted original custom knives for chefs and individuals both locally and nationally.</p>
<p>Now I would like to take the next step and offer the opportunity to own hand made knives based on favorites from my own custom designs to the public.  These knives will be of heirloom quality; beautiful and functional with superb fit and finish, and made from the best high carbon stainless steel available, by me, full time, right here in Cambridge.  </p>
<p>Every knife produced will carry an unconditional guarantee and be welcomed back to the shop for free sharpening forever.</p>
<p>I am asking for $18,000 to upgrade my workshop and finance the productrion of, at minimum 25 each, of the two most important knives one needs, a 260mm (10 1/4”) Chefs knife, and a 100mm (4”) Paring knife, and durable packaging for both which will double as travel case and storage. </p>
<p>If demand goes beyond 25 of each I will be prepared to fullfill orders on an ongoing basis. </p>
<p>Ultimately I would like to build a collection comprising 5-7 knives that represent what I consider <em>the</em> essential tools for the kitchen. </p>
<p>Your contribition will allow me to build out my workshop, invest in custom designed and built grinding and finishing eqipment, improved ventilation and dust control, and realize significant economies in buying materials like steel, bronze, silver, wood, hardware and grinding supplies, and outside services like heat treating and wood stabilizing.  It will also help make it possible for me to produce and offer superb hand made knives in a reasonable amount of time at an attainable price going forward. </p>
<p>Initially, the knives will be produced at a rate of aproximately five pieces per week by me in the MKS workshop in Cambridge, with hopes to double that rate of production as demand allows.</p>
<p>In exchange for your support, I am offering as perks, one or both knives from this first run, a matching handled diamond sharpening steel, and a leather honing strap complete with instructions. </p>
<p>I believe that a knife you value, respect, and care for...even love, can change how you cook and eat for the better..it can truly change your life.</p>
<p>Please help me make superb kitchen cutlery possible for as many people as I can. </p>

Hemos inventado el primer fertilizante 100% derivado de reciclaje de descartes vegetales de Panamá. Somos un emprendimiento joven llamado Productos Orgánicos Panameños (PoP) y necesitamos su ayuda para continuar operando, ofreciendo nuestro producto a precios justos y enseñando agricultura sostenible.

“Planta Feliz” to Panama
We have created the very first 100%
Panamanian discarded vegetable byproduct fertilizer.  We are a young venture named “Productos
Orgánicos Panameños (POP)”- stands for Panamanian Organic Products – and we
need your help to continue operating, offering our product at fair prices, and
teaching sustainable agriculture.



Planta Feliz 
El fertilizante que está cambiando la forma de cultivar en Panamá. Transformamos un problema (basura orgánica) en una solución, que es un fertilizante de acción rápida, fácil de usar y que no es un riesgo para los usuarios o el ambiente. Hoy se distribuye a nivel nacional, pero necesitamos tu ayuda para llegar aun a más personas y transformarlo en la base de una revolución de comida urbana. 

“Planta Feliz”
The fertilizer that is changing the way we grow food in Panama.  We take a potential burden (organic waste),
and we turn it into a utility, a fast-acting fertilizer that is easy to use and
is not a hazard to the consumers nor the environment.  It is presently being distributed nationwide,
but we still need your help to make it even more widespread, and transform it
into the foundations of an urban farming revolution.

<div>
<b>Chicago Blog Week Summer 2015</b> is a five-day event including a 
Conference and Expo, Blog Awards Ceremony, Community Meetup and Pub 
Crawl. The event is designed to educate bloggers with hands-on, 
interactive instruction on <b>How To Monetize Their Blogs and Increase Revenue,</b> and also <b>Recognize and Honor Bloggers. </b>
<p></p>
<p>Our campaign will be launched in two phases: </p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Phase 1 Goal Amount: $1,627</b> - Current Campaign (live now)<br/>
</li>
<li>Phase 2 Goal Amount: $12-15k - Follow on campaign (TBD)</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
I’m Dante Hamilton, Graphic Designer / Web Developer turned Event Organizer. I am the founder and lead organizer of <b><a href=""https://ChicagoBlogWeek.Eventbrite.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Chicago Blog Week™ Summer 2015</a></b>. 
</div>
<p>In 2008 I co-founded <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/mywplife"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Chicago WordPress Meetup Group</a> (ChiWP) with Bruce Montgomery, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/techaccesstv/videos"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Host of Technology Access TV</a> on Cable Access Television here in Chicago, IL USA. ChiWP is the foundation for Chicago Blog Week™ Summer 2015.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431551359/mlmwr9nz7vl820fshmt9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
</p><div>
<h3>Our Track Record of Success</h3>
<p></p>
<p>ChiWP
 become the 5th largest WordPress Group on Meetup.com early on, then it 
peaked at 900+ members. See chart from Meetup.com below:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431552542/vos6pxysiaxiib3tazqa.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Currently there are 800+ members, mostly bloggers and web developers who use <a href=""https://wordpress.org/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">WordPress,</a> the number one blogging software in the world. According to W3Techs.com, <a href=""http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management/all"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">WordPress is used by 23.9% of all websites</a>.</p>
<p>
ChiWP has hosted over 120 Meetups, mainly 1-2 hour Free WordPress trainings. In 2009, ChiWP members collaborated to create a <b><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/1DayWPWorkshop"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">1-Day WordPress Workshop</a></b>, which was launched at <a href=""http://officeport.us/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">OfficePort Chicago</a>, a collaborative workspace similar to 1871 Chicago, that opened back in 2009. 
</p>
<p>My company, <a href=""http://www.bbb.org/chicago/business-reviews/web-design/internet-webpages-newspaper-in-chicago-il-88084332"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Internet Webpages Newspaper Inc</a> (IWN), was the very first OfficePort tenant, and our offices are still located in the facility (see photo of office below).</p>
<p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431689116/qr4s6afbrkqjy0pzndec.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div>
<b>1-Day WP Workshop Trained Dozens of Attendees</b>
<p></p>
<p>
From 2009-2011 we trained dozens of ChiWP members, and accumulated over <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/mywplife/about/comments/?op=all"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">50-plus testimonials on Meetup.com</a>. 
</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431556843/y49qllzq07be5lu2de0p.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
The 1-Day WP Workshop alone generated
 over $4,000-plus in revenues as a paid Meetup.com event, something very
 rare at that time, and developed a successful event-driven business 
model. 
</p>
<p>
See our financial results below achieved from actual Meetup.com statistics:

<h3>Giving Back to the Chicago WordPress Community</h3>
<div>
<div>
<span>As a way to give back for the financial success of <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/1DayWPWorkshop"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">1-Day WP Workshop</a>, In November 2010, the Chicago Blog Week Lead Organizer, who is founder of <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/mywplife"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Chicago WordPress Meetup Group</b></a>, the largest WordPress Meetup in Chicago, setup <b><a href=""http://chicagowpexpo.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Chicago WP Expo</a></b> -
 a free event designed to educate the community about the benefits of 
WordPress websites and blogs (very similar in context to Chicago Blog 
Week Summer 2015). 
<p></p>
<p>
Chicago WP Expo launched as a FREE, 2-Day Hands-on, Interactive Training. 150+
 Chicago WordPress Meetup Group members RSVPd, and 75 attended over that
 weekend, helping Bloggers like Diana Kakoma create AfricanChicago.com.
</p>
<p>The event was held at <a href=""http://officeport.us/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">OfficePort Chicago</a>,
 which you can see in the background on the blow video of Diana Kakoma. 
Ironically, the very space behind Diana Kakoma is exactly where Chicago 
Blog Week / IWN offices are located today.</p>
<p><span>In
 June 2011, ChiWP Expo was held at University Conference Center in 
downtown Chicago. Over 70+ Chicago WordPress Meetup Group members and 
others RSVPd with 35 people attending that two-day event. These two 
Chicago WP Expo events was our way of giving back to members who paid to
 attend 1-Day WP Workshop trainings. </span></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><b>The Potential Impact Chicago Blog Week Summer 2015 Will Have on the Global Blogging Community</b></h3>
<p>Listen to a testimonial from Chicago WP Expo attendee Diana Kakoma 
and feel the impact of the Chicago WP Expo event from her own words:</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FZW-hIuusVwQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZW-hIuusVwQ&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FZW-hIuusVwQ%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>
<h3>What happened to Diana Kakoma after she attended Chicago WP Expo in 2010? </h3>
<p>See for yourself. Here is her website: <b><a href=""http://africanchicago.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">AfricanChicago.com</a></b>. She even gives a shout out to the Chicago WordPress Meetup Group on her About page here: <b><a href=""http://africanchicago.com/site-info-2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Site Info</a> </b>as she says <i>Thank You</i> ""<a href=""http://www.meetup.com/mywplife/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Chicago WordPress Meetup Group</a> for all your early encouragement and enthusiastic support.""</p>
<p><b><i>Chicago Blog Week Summer 2015 will have a similar effect on attendees just as Chicago WP Expo did on Diana Kakoma. </i></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Here's Why Chicago Blog Week Summer 2015 Is So Important</h3>
<b></b><div>
<b>
<b>52% of Bloggers Earn Less Than $1,000 Annually</b>, based on research from <a href=""http://technorati.com/report/2013-dir/influencers-revenue/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>TechnoratiMedia's 2013 Digital Influencer Report</b></a>.
</b><p></p>

<p><b>Is this statistic for real? </b></p>
<p>Absolutely. I can show you first hand how real it is. For instance my video blog, <a href=""http://MyChicagoJourneys.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MyChicagoJourneys.com</a>, is a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/MyChicagoJourneys/videos"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">YouTube.com Channel</a>. With over 900+ videos, 140 subscribers and over 175,000 views in nearly five years, <b>my total Lifetime estimated earnings (June 16, 2010 - May 11, 2015) is less $100! </b>See for yourself below:</p>

<p></p>
<h3>The Profound Effect and Magnitude of Your Contribution</h3>
<p>Unfortunately for me, I was never taught 
how to monetize my Youtube,com channel. Had someone showed me how to 
setup my channel properly, and then how to increase revenues with <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/chicago-blog-week-summer-2015/edit/MyChicagoJourneys.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MyChicagoJourneys.com</a>, I could have potentially increased my revenues of $85 to maybe 10-times that amount to $850, or even more. </p>
<p>This is the profound effect and magnitude 
of what your contribution to Chicago Blog Week Summer 2015 will mean for
 bloggers like me who attend this event. So please help us educate and 
honor bloggers with a contribution now. </p>

Our Story



Chicago Blog Week Summer 2015 is a five-day event including a 
Conference and Expo, Blog Awards Ceremony, Community Meetup and Pub 
Crawl. The event is designed to educate bloggers with hands-on, 
interactive instruction on How To Monetize Their Blogs and Increase Revenue, and also Recognize and Honor Bloggers. 

Our campaign will be launched in two phases: 



Phase 1 Goal Amount: $1,627 - Current Campaign (live now)

Phase 2 Goal Amount: $12-15k - Follow on campaign (TBD)


I’m Dante Hamilton, Graphic Designer / Web Developer turned Event Organizer. I am the founder and lead organizer of Chicago Blog Week™ Summer 2015. 

In 2008 I co-founded Chicago WordPress Meetup Group (ChiWP) with Bruce Montgomery, Host of Technology Access TV on Cable Access Television here in Chicago, IL USA. ChiWP is the foundation for Chicago Blog Week™ Summer 2015.


Our Track Record of Success

ChiWP
 become the 5th largest WordPress Group on Meetup.com early on, then it 
peaked at 900+ members. See chart from Meetup.com below:

Currently there are 800+ members, mostly bloggers and web developers who use WordPress, the number one blogging software in the world. According to W3Techs.com, WordPress is used by 23.9% of all websites.

ChiWP has hosted over 120 Meetups, mainly 1-2 hour Free WordPress trainings. In 2009, ChiWP members collaborated to create a 1-Day WordPress Workshop, which was launched at OfficePort Chicago, a collaborative workspace similar to 1871 Chicago, that opened back in 2009. 

My company, Internet Webpages Newspaper Inc (IWN), was the very first OfficePort tenant, and our offices are still located in the facility (see photo of office below).




1-Day WP Workshop Trained Dozens of Attendees


From 2009-2011 we trained dozens of ChiWP members, and accumulated over 50-plus testimonials on Meetup.com. 



The 1-Day WP Workshop alone generated
 over $4,000-plus in revenues as a paid Meetup.com event, something very
 rare at that time, and developed a successful event-driven business 
model. 


See our financial results below achieved from actual Meetup.com statistics:



Giving Back to the Chicago WordPress Community


As a way to give back for the financial success of 1-Day WP Workshop, In November 2010, the Chicago Blog Week Lead Organizer, who is founder of Chicago WordPress Meetup Group, the largest WordPress Meetup in Chicago, setup Chicago WP Expo -
 a free event designed to educate the community about the benefits of 
WordPress websites and blogs (very similar in context to Chicago Blog 
Week Summer 2015). 


Chicago WP Expo launched as a FREE, 2-Day Hands-on, Interactive Training. 150+
 Chicago WordPress Meetup Group members RSVPd, and 75 attended over that
 weekend, helping Bloggers like Diana Kakoma create AfricanChicago.com.

The event was held at OfficePort Chicago,
 which you can see in the background on the blow video of Diana Kakoma. 
Ironically, the very space behind Diana Kakoma is exactly where Chicago 
Blog Week / IWN offices are located today.
In
 June 2011, ChiWP Expo was held at University Conference Center in 
downtown Chicago. Over 70+ Chicago WordPress Meetup Group members and 
others RSVPd with 35 people attending that two-day event. These two 
Chicago WP Expo events was our way of giving back to members who paid to
 attend 1-Day WP Workshop trainings. 


The Potential Impact Chicago Blog Week Summer 2015 Will Have on the Global Blogging Community
Listen to a testimonial from Chicago WP Expo attendee Diana Kakoma 
and feel the impact of the Chicago WP Expo event from her own words:

What happened to Diana Kakoma after she attended Chicago WP Expo in 2010? 
See for yourself. Here is her website: AfricanChicago.com. She even gives a shout out to the Chicago WordPress Meetup Group on her About page here: Site Info as she says Thank You ""Chicago WordPress Meetup Group for all your early encouragement and enthusiastic support.""
Chicago Blog Week Summer 2015 will have a similar effect on attendees just as Chicago WP Expo did on Diana Kakoma. 



Here's Why Chicago Blog Week Summer 2015 Is So Important


52% of Bloggers Earn Less Than $1,000 Annually, based on research from TechnoratiMedia's 2013 Digital Influencer Report.





Is this statistic for real? 
Absolutely. I can show you first hand how real it is. For instance my video blog, MyChicagoJourneys.com, is a YouTube.com Channel. With over 900+ videos, 140 subscribers and over 175,000 views in nearly five years, my total Lifetime estimated earnings (June 16, 2010 - May 11, 2015) is less $100! See for yourself below:


The Profound Effect and Magnitude of Your Contribution
Unfortunately for me, I was never taught 
how to monetize my Youtube,com channel. Had someone showed me how to 
setup my channel properly, and then how to increase revenues with MyChicagoJourneys.com, I could have potentially increased my revenues of $85 to maybe 10-times that amount to $850, or even more. 
This is the profound effect and magnitude 
of what your contribution to Chicago Blog Week Summer 2015 will mean for
 bloggers like me who attend this event. So please help us educate and 
honor bloggers with a contribution now. 
You can make a donation in any amount without buying a perk, just click the Contribute Now button above. Please support us!
The Global Blogosphere: 158 Million Blogs
According to a Wikipedia citation: ""In 2011 it was estimated that there are more than 158 million identified blogs."" The success of Chicago Blog Week™ Summer 2015 will have far-reaching implications for bloggers everywhere.
Two Main Goals of Chicago Blog Week™ Summer 2015
The are two primary goals of Chicago Blog Week Summer 2015 that will help alleviate this low income dilemma for most bloggers:




Educate Bloggers on How To Monetize Their Blogs and Increase Revenues with a 3-Day Conference


Promote, Recognize and Honor Bloggers from around the world in a Chicago Blog Week Awards Ceremony (similar to an Oscar Award or Webby Award event) with a 13"" Statuette Trophy shown below:







What We Need & What You Get

Our Phase 1 Goal Amount is only $1,627 and it will be used to finance the purchase of an Attendify Mobile App (shown below), which will be used as the Chicago Blog Week Summer 2015 event application.

Why a Mobile App for Chicago Blog Week Summer 2015? 
According to a Nielsen report released March 5, 2014, while all smartphone users spent 89 percent of their mobile media time in Q4 2013 using mobile apps, women spent nearly an hour-and-a-half more than men using mobile apps.




Chicago Blog Week Summer 2015's target audience, is tech savvy, affluent women (men are welcome to attend as well).

Our Phase 2 Goal of $12,000 covers the cost to manufacture 30 Blog 
Award Trophies (shown above). This follow on campaign will be conducted 
once we reach our Phase 1 Goal.  




Here are the costs breakdown:



Phase 1 Goal: Mobile App powered by Attendify = $1,627

<b><h3>Bella Solviva is excited to announce the acquisition of our permanent home outside of East Jordan, Michigan!</h3>
<h3></h3></b>
</h3>
<p>

the Jordan River Valley, on West Old State Road five miles east of 
Central Lake, half way between East Jordan and Bellaire, and 25 miles 
west of Gaylord.</p>
<p> With sweeping vistas, winding creeks, cedar and pine forests and towering hardwoods, we knew this was home. The two ponds,
 one which features an adventure island in the center of the pond, will 
be sure to stir the imagination of your children and create family 
memories for years to come.</p>
<p>

<br/><h3>
Phase I Note<br/>
</h3>
<p>We have chosen crowdfunding for our first phase to use as  a proof of concept.   This means that we wish to ascertain whether or not <i><b>Bella Solviva</b></i> is a viable concept, by means of the interest generated by this campaign.  If we hit our modest goal, we know the interest is there and will move on to Phase II.  If the interest is not evident, we will gladly refund those that participated in this phase if desired, (minus Indiegogo fees) and reevaluate our approach for the future.  <br/></p>
<p>It should be noted that no Indiegogo campground campaign we've found has garnered much of any support, <b><i>Bella Solviva</i> is very different.</b>  So, if you feel our concept hits the mark as something you and your family would enjoy for years to come, purchase with confidence! <br/></p>
<h3>
<b>Project Overview</b><i><br/></i>
</h3>
<p><b>This is not your Grandfather's campground.</b>  <b><i>Bella Solviva</i></b> is a comfy camping eco-resort, being created for the outdoor adventure enthusiast who has an appetite for indulgence.  While traditional camping and RV's are supported at <b><i>Bella Solviva</i></b>, our emphasis is on glamping!  What's glamping, you say?  It's a new word for a new kind of travel - defined as posh, luxury or boutique camping.  Glamping is a fusion of glamour and camping which emerged internationally and came across the Atlantic over the last decade. Glamping emphasizes a high level services and amenities which focus on the complete comfort of our guests.<br/><em></em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><em><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1329934/files/20150326191907-Glamping_Tent_01.jpg?1427422747"" src="""" style=""""/></em></p>
<em>
<b><i>Bella Solviva</i></b> is Midwest's first and only glamping destination where travelers will experience the positive aspects of camping without the uncomfortable negatives.  As our guest, you'll choose from an array of furnished accommodations; there’s no tent to pitch, no RV to haul and no sleeping bag to unroll. (unless you want to; we have sites for you, too!)  Whether in a safari tent, teepee, airstream, airliner, caboose, cabin, villa or tree house, you can experience the great outdoors without sacrificing comfort or luxury while enjoying an endless combination of year round activities, amenities, and services to make your stay relaxing and memorable. <br/></em><p></p>

<strong>GLAMPING' AN UNDERSERVED MARKET (from Crain's Chicago Busines)<br/></strong><p>Glamping is an
 underserved market in the area, Brad Carlson said. “There's nothing 
like it. Campgrounds are already overflowing, so they need more 
occupancy.  I think we're hitting the right market at the 
right time with the right product, and we are interested to see if 
Indiegogo people agree with that.”</p>
<p>Ryan Hutchings, the Salt Lake City-based general manager of <a href=""http://glamping.com/blog/michigan-opens-doors-its-first-glamping-site/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Glamping.com</a>,
 a website through which guests can book glamping accommodations, agreed
 that the market is underserved, especially in the Midwest.</p>
<p>“It is
 still spread out across the country. You have a few places in Florida 
that serve it; you have California, Washington, Montana, and then beyond
 they are kind of interspersed here and there,” he said. “Unless you 
live in proximity to one of those places, it becomes a much bigger 
commitment.” </p>Since then, independent properties and global 
hospitality brands, including Four Seasons, have capitalized on the 
rising trend. Hutchings said online glamping search volumes have grown 
by double digits every month since January 2012. He said there are an 
estimated 2,000 to 3,000 glamping sites worldwide.<p>Alden, Mich., 
sits on the shores of Torch Lake, which runs parallel to the Grand 
Traverse Bay. The town is deep in Michigan wine country, and the area 
draws tourists from Chicago and Detroit focused on wine, hunting, water,
 foliage and cross-country skiing. It is about a 40-minute drive from 
Traverse City, which hosts outdoor recreation such as Sleeping Bear 
Dunes, Traverse City State Forest and other activities surrounding Lake 
Michigan. </p>
<p>“Glamping really epitomizes what we call experiential 
travel,” Hutchings said. “Where you are staying is part of your 
experience. It is not just another piece where you go back to your hotel
 room and sleep, it is part of your trip.”</p>
<p>Campsites are plentiful
 throughout the area, but Hutchings confirmed glamping sites are rare. 
<a href=""http://glamping.com/blog/michigan-opens-doors-its-first-glamping-site/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Glamping.com</a> lists only two sites in Michigan, one in the Upper 
Peninsula and one just north of the Indiana border. Glamping Hub, 
another website devoted to the activity, identifies only <a href=""https://glampinghub.com/rentalsearch/?q=Michigan%2C+United+States&amp;checkin=&amp;checkout=&amp;guests=2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">two places</a><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/bella-solviva/edit/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href="""" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://glampinghub.com/rentalsearch/?q=Michigan%2C+United+States&amp;checkin=&amp;checkout=&amp;guests=2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a> to glamp in the Grand Traverse Bay area—a yurt in Lake Leelanau and a garden cottage on Lakeview Lake.</p>
<p>The
 Chicago area has the same kind of scarcity in glamping sites, Hutchings
 said, with only a few locations listed on either website throughout 
Illinois and Wisconsin.</p>

</div></div>","Bella Solviva is excited to announce the acquisition of our permanent home outside of East Jordan, Michigan!



 The Bella Solviva eco-resort is now located on 229 stunning acres in 
the Jordan River Valley, on West Old State Road five miles east of 
Central Lake, half way between East Jordan and Bellaire, and 25 miles 
west of Gaylord.
 With sweeping vistas, winding creeks, cedar and pine forests and towering hardwoods, we knew this was home. The two ponds,
 one which features an adventure island in the center of the pond, will 
be sure to stir the imagination of your children and create family 
memories for years to come.

 We expect to announce an opening date this coming week, and are 
shooting for a handful of sites to be available in July.  The 
announcement will coincide with our reservation system being turned on, 
allowing you to choose available accommodations and finalize your 
reservation.
 We are thrilled to partner with you in building a 
legacy of traditions.  Use our referral program to share your excitement
 about Bella Solviva and glamp with us for free.  Check out our surveys 
to receive a discount on your first reservation and visit our 
sponsorship page to customize a glamping accommodation to your own 
personal specifications.  We are building it so you can come! Follow us on Facebook or at BellaSolviva.com.  Reservations will be available shortly.  Let’s do 
this!


Phase I Note

We have chosen crowdfunding for our first phase to use as  a proof of concept.   This means that we wish to ascertain whether or not Bella Solviva is a viable concept, by means of the interest generated by this campaign.  If we hit our modest goal, we know the interest is there and will move on to Phase II.  If the interest is not evident, we will gladly refund those that participated in this phase if desired, (minus Indiegogo fees) and reevaluate our approach for the future.  
It should be noted that no Indiegogo campground campaign we've found has garnered much of any support, Bella Solviva is very different.  So, if you feel our concept hits the mark as something you and your family would enjoy for years to come, purchase with confidence! 

Project Overview

This is not your Grandfather's campground.  Bella Solviva is a comfy camping eco-resort, being created for the outdoor adventure enthusiast who has an appetite for indulgence.  While traditional camping and RV's are supported at Bella Solviva, our emphasis is on glamping!  What's glamping, you say?  It's a new word for a new kind of travel - defined as posh, luxury or boutique camping.  Glamping is a fusion of glamour and camping which emerged internationally and came across the Atlantic over the last decade. Glamping emphasizes a high level services and amenities which focus on the complete comfort of our guests.



Bella Solviva is Midwest's first and only glamping destination where travelers will experience the positive aspects of camping without the uncomfortable negatives.  As our guest, you'll choose from an array of furnished accommodations; there’s no tent to pitch, no RV to haul and no sleeping bag to unroll. (unless you want to; we have sites for you, too!)  Whether in a safari tent, teepee, airstream, airliner, caboose, cabin, villa or tree house, you can experience the great outdoors without sacrificing comfort or luxury while enjoying an endless combination of year round activities, amenities, and services to make your stay relaxing and memorable. 

If you are looking to experience the peace and tranquility of the 
outdoors coupled with the ease and comfort of a lavish retreat, then 
welcome to your new favorite vacation destination - Bella Solviva!

How long will depend on your support. Children under the age of 5 are the most suseptable to water borne illnesses The ultimate goal is to take everything we learn about the sustainability effort going on in Fiji, and share this with our partners in Nepal and NGOs around the world working for clean water access.   NEPALIn April 2015 a 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit the country of Nepal.It damaged 600k homes and 5k public buildings.Displaced people are living under tarps, in man-made temporary housing.Pre-earthquake: 10,500+ children die every year from diarrhea, caused by contaminated water.Nepal’s clean water crisis is a complex problem with many compounding issues.Government pumps water but does NOT filter.Nepal Progress Report: 50% of population, 16 million, practices open defecation, 80% of communicable diseases are a result of contaminated waterNo toilets or running water - open defecation and high probability of diseaseIndia’s fuel blockade just months ago. (India’s reaction to Nepal's recent Constitution).We have partnered with the group Volunteer Initiative Nepal (VIN) to incorporate our filtration systems into their current hygiene and sanitation programs in rural parts of the country. VIN volunteers preparing filters to take to rural villages in Nepal Currently we have the potential to distribute at least 6500 filtration systems over the next year, through VIN's already well organized network of volunteers.  This is a great challenge ahead of us. Our first goal is to raise the funds to distribute 1000 filtration systems, then we will focusing on delivering clean water to every single family household in the areas detailed below. 6,500 filters (completed systems) will cost approximately $125,000.  While this is an enormous goal, we do not need full funding immediately to start delivering filtration systems in Nepal.   Our teams will start doing humanitarian trips with 100+ filters at a time to take to more centralized locations, before we work reach every single household.   Our team is also working on ongoing project development, and is directly involved with distribution working side by side with VIN. 
Filters will be distributed to:
schoolsECD centerscommunity centersorphanageslocal government public officesmonasteries(350 filters NEEDED) Filters will be distributed to Families in:Taluwa, Thulachhap & Bhadaure of Okhaldhunga (2000 filters NEEDED)Okharpouwa (1900)Nuwakot and Kavresthali (1000)Jitpurphedi (1250) This project runs under the WASH (Water Sanitation & Hygiene) of VIN. The success of this project will help us gain support to branch out and bring more remote regions of the country clean water access.  This is only the beginning.(VIN volunteers preparing filtration systems for distribution) Our first clean water ambassadors have just returned from working with VIN on clean water initiatives, where they assisted in delivery of filters and identifying areas lacking clean water. VIN teams are also building wells, toilets, and the septic systems.  Over 1000 toilets have been built already by VIN. We can go back to the installed bases immediately to implement water filters. Installing toilets (VIN's primary project) AND providing purified water is a three prong solution... Remove the waste from the water, supply and provide disease-free filtered water to wash hands and drink, and education. Only 30% of the population wash hands after defecation and only 12% use soap.It's difficult to describe how life saving these filters are... Any support will save lives, NOW.  VIN is heading this project currently.  They have proven that their connection to the families in communities we are trying to reach is invaluable!   THE GLOBAL MOVEMENTNGOs are using this filter technology and distribution techniques in 70 different countries around the world to bring MILLIONS of individuals clean water access. Please join us in helping to spread this amazing cause and combat the global clean water crisis.As we continue to learn about the sustainability effort in Fiji, we want to take this knowledge and spread it to NGOs around the world.  There are countless groups working on clean water, hygiene, and sanitation projects. We want to help them realize the potential of these filtration systems. We have a great challenge ahead of us, to raise the funds and awareness necessary to reach our goals with our partners in Fiji and Nepal, as well as to advise other NGOs on our innovative filter and education systems. Our team is ready to start working on these projects full-time.  We can use all the help we can get to create a sustainable future of clean water access for those in need.   EVEN IF YOU CAN'T DONATE NOW YOU CAN STILL HELP THE CAUSE Start a Project/ FundraiserAre you a creator and an organizer?

<p>We
are La Commune, a worker owned café and bookstore. </p>
<p>But
not yet. There is still a lot of work to do before we can actually say that we
are a worker owned café and bookstore. Currently we are a worker owned
bookstore in a big messy room with no plumbing (and believe us, it already took
a lot of work to get this far.) We need your help!</p>
<p>Hence,
this indiegogo.
We are trying to raise funds to give our little café a good start in life,
and take care of one or two things our health and fire permit issuing pals have
ever so sweetly requested.</p>
<p>Let's
talk a little more about La Commune, before we talk about money.</p>
<p>La
Commune is located in the Omni building in North Oakland. A group of ragtag
sweethearts with crazy political views moved into this building this summer.
They formed the <a href=""https://omnicommons.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Omni Oakland Commons</a>, a collective of collectives that includes
artists, hackers, citizen scientists, dancers, a free university called the Bay Area
Public School, a community print studio, a wellness collective, and us, with
even more to come.</p>
<p>The
idea of La Commune came from a mind melding session (during a full moon!) of
David Brazil and Niki Shelley, of the Bay Area Public School. David wanted to
support the public school with a bookshop and small press. Niki dreamed of
creating a welcoming space for the Omni community and all its neighbors to gather,
mingle, talk and break bread together. It wasn’t long before the two dreams
became one even bigger and better dream. Then they began looking for the cast
they would need to make it a reality. Soon they had rounded up a band of
seasoned book and café warriors, Seven Samurai style, to build a
café bookstore worthy of the Omni vision: veteran booksellers Owen Hill
and Pamela Jackson, and writer and coffee wrangler Steve Orth.</p>
<p>The
five of us have been working hard for 5 months to get La Commune off the ground.
We're excited about our project for so many reasons. We’re excited to
collaborate with our comrades at the Omni and provide a welcoming and nurturing
space for the community. We’re excited to bring good books and coffee to a
neighborhood where rising rents are making it impossible for no or low profit
businesses like these to survive. We’re excited about the unique space we’ve
moved into, and what we can do with it. Here are some specifics of o<span>ur vision:</span></p>
<p><b>The
bookstore</b><span>: we’ll
carry new and used books, with an emphasis on literature, poetry, philosophy,
radical politics, and other topics close to our collective hearts. We’ll be a
general bookstore as well, with a fabulous kids section, cookbooks, urban
gardening and DIY, art, science and everything in between. We will buy and
trade used books at our buying counter starting Opening Day.</span></p>
<p>As
battle-scarred veterans of the book trade, we're well aware it’s a tough time
to open an independent bookstore. Soon Amazon will be delivering books by
drone. With a free cup of coffee. We know this. But we also know our
neighborhood needs a bookstore.  In the spirit of mutual support -- and in
the interest of a thriving world of books and ideas-- we’re seeking
partnerships with small local presses and distributors, who are also feeling
the pinch of online retail. Expect to see a dedicated table for Small Press
Distribution in Berkeley and PM Press in Oakland, to start with, with more to
follow. In the same spirit we will be hosting regular readings and book parties
for local and visiting authors, and instituting a membership program with
discounts on books and café fare.</p>
<p><b>The
café</b> : we aim to provide a friendly and  unpretentious
alternative to the work station cafés that are popping up around the city: a
comfortable space that welcomes the whole neighborhood with affordable
coffee and wholesome foods. We'll start small with coffee, baked goods and
sandwiches, but our dreams include soft serve ice cream and kombucha on tap.
Really!</p>
<p><b>Beyond
the café bookstore -- La Commune at the Omni</b>:<span> Once we have our space fixed up we can’t wait to
get started on all the fruitful and mutually supportive collaborations we’re
envisioning with other collectives in the Omni. We see La Commune as an integral part of a project much bigger, more ambitious and more amazing than just ourselves: the co-creation of a community and art space in Oakland open to all. We hope La Commune will be a
classroom for the Bay Area Public School, a publisher of broadsides, posters,
and chapbooks printed out of the Omni basement, an outlet for selling Omni-made
wares, and a place for readings, workshops and gatherings of all sorts. But first...</span></p>
<p><b>What
we’re asking:</b></p>
<p>Why
do we need your money? Great question.</p>
<p>A
lot of the stuff that was in our space that looked ready to use turned out to
be broken or in violation of numerous city codes. Other stuff just wasn’t
there. We had to remove the old bar, because it was rotten underneath, and
we’re starting from scratch with the plumbing and electrical. We're opening the
bookstore while still under construction, but we have a lot more to do before
we can start serving coffee or food, and some of it is expensive. Here are some
of the boring things that we didn’t plan on needing but can’t do without:</p>

A place that connects the city of Krakow cultural tradition and modern approach to eating and spending time in developing creative ways - <b>„Hariprasad Samosa &amp; Curry”</b></p>
<p>It is going to be a place of vegan food, mainly inspired by Indian cuisine but not only..Hariprasad in India means  karma free food, spiritual food, which has a positive effect on our body and spirit. We would like to make this place among few vegan and vegetarian places in Krakow not only focused on pleasing the palate, but also the place where we can strengthen our spirit, relax from the hectic and frenzied pursuit of profit and endless desires, where we can focus on our interior, meet people with similar needs , take part in lectures on yoga and self-development or listen to live music, which goes to our hearts in a building ..</p>
<p>This idea was born out of my personal needs as I was working as a vegetarian chef for many years. I used to work as a chef in England, Birmingham, the award-winning The Warehouse Cafe (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/thewarehousecafe?%20fref%20=%20ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/thewarehousecafe? fref = ts</a>) as well as in various places in Krakow and Warsaw. </p>
<p>I am interested in yoga and self-development, I met many local yoga teachers and a lot of people looking for the true values in life, not necessarily related to a specific religion. Living in Krakow, I miss the place where I could spend time in the evening not drinking a beer and not stuffy room on cigarettes where I felt my senses become more dull than alive, but in a place where I could meet creative people interested in yoga, self-development, art and philosophy of different cultures.

A place that connects the city of Krakow cultural tradition and modern approach to eating and spending time in developing creative ways - „Hariprasad Samosa & Curry”
It is going to be a place of vegan food, mainly inspired by Indian cuisine but not only..Hariprasad in India means  karma free food, spiritual food, which has a positive effect on our body and spirit. We would like to make this place among few vegan and vegetarian places in Krakow not only focused on pleasing the palate, but also the place where we can strengthen our spirit, relax from the hectic and frenzied pursuit of profit and endless desires, where we can focus on our interior, meet people with similar needs , take part in lectures on yoga and self-development or listen to live music, which goes to our hearts in a building ..
This idea was born out of my personal needs as I was working as a vegetarian chef for many years. I used to work as a chef in England, Birmingham, the award-winning The Warehouse Cafe (https://www.facebook.com/thewarehousecafe? fref = ts) as well as in various places in Krakow and Warsaw. 
I am interested in yoga and self-development, I met many local yoga teachers and a lot of people looking for the true values in life, not necessarily related to a specific religion. Living in Krakow, I miss the place where I could spend time in the evening not drinking a beer and not stuffy room on cigarettes where I felt my senses become more dull than alive, but in a place where I could meet creative people interested in yoga, self-development, art and philosophy of different cultures. Talk to them, be inspired, exchange the experience, a place for people interested in the broader of the Eastern philosophy but not only…for those who are looking for something more in life, can meet other people thinking the same way, stay together, have delicious karma free meal.

<h4>(Where your money and our money is going)</h4>
<p>A Brand New Entertainment and Personal Development Facility<br/>(Part 1 of our campaign is to fund the development of an indoor skatepark)</p>
<p><b>*Please note:</b> We aren't 'Re-building' the Skatepark of Memphis that once existed.<br/>This is an entirely new project and we've been granted permission from previous owners to use the original name. Skatepark of Memphis was built with years of hard work, dedication and community support. We do not wish to discredit the family that spent their time and money to birth such a great experience for the Memphis alternative sports community, Memphis' independent music scene and the youth who contributed to the success of the park and it's name. We have a unique opportunity to make Memphis a part of the, now, mainstream sport.<br/></p>
<p>The provision of a sport or recreation facility can significantly 
enhance the quality of life. Activities held within sport and recreation
 facilities can encourage participation, promote health and well-being 
and foster a sense of community. However, planning a sport or recreation
 facility is an involved and sometimes difficult task. <strike>Our project is big.</strike> <strong>OUR PROJECT IS HUGE </strong>and
 considering that this is an individual effort to support independent 
artists, designers, business owners, brands and, in general, creatives, 
The project may or may not be partially funded by the city/state 
and <b>could </b>take 1-3 years to be fully funded before construction begins. 
The park will be designed and constructed by <a href=""http://californiaskateparks.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">California Skateparks</a>.<br/>The photos below are rendered to represent quality and do <b>NOT</b> accurately represent architecture, park design, material use or scale.

<p>In addition, our goal is to open a skate-bike-inline shop (featuring 
products from both local and well known brands) and a flagship popup 
shop featuring only products from sponsored artists, affiliate partners
&amp; Memphis-based Indie apparel brands <a href=""https://thelabellust.com/apparel"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Label Lust Apparel</a> + Affiliated Partners like <a href=""https://thelabellust.com/apparel"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ME Skateboarding Co.</a><br/>The photos below are rendered to represent quality and minimalist taste but do <b>NOT</b> accurately represent architecture, shop design, material use or scale.

<p>The Skatepark of Memphis will be a privately owned park. In an effort
 to support local independent talent, local small and big independently 
owned businesses, provide job and internship opportunities, education, 
relationship and wealth building strategies to the Memphis community, 
the Indoor skatepark and surrounding facilities (eg. apparel design, 
recording, photography, videography, visual art, technology, dance, 
business network and digital branding studios) will be accessible via 
monthly/annual memberships or pay-per-day and pay-per-session rates. 
This would allow us to keep the park open forever and could allow us to 
keep the lights on 24/7. The facility will be constructed with 
state-of-the art materials and technology and the park itself would be 
constructed with concrete, minimizing hazards and upkeep costs.

<p> </p>
<h3><a name=""why"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A Professionally Designed Concrete Skatepark Will:</a></h3> <p>• Provide a safe challenging place for skateboarding (and similar extreme sports), allowing participants to develop as athletes<br/>•
 Provide an alternative to team sports, to develop motor skills &amp; 
balance in youth and the young-at-heart. Playgrounds are provided for 
younger children, but for older youth who don’t participate in team 
sports, there is often nothing.<br/>• Attract visitors (skatepark 
enthusiasts &amp; spectators) who enjoy skateboarding &amp; similar 
extreme sports. When people visit they spend money!<br/>• Make community 
more youth-friendly &amp; give youth the message that they’re accepted 
&amp; valued members of the community, by giving them a place to call 
their own &amp; a creative outlet to express themselves<br/>• Provide 
opportunity for healthy activity for youth, helping curb problems of 
inactivity &amp; drug abuse (According to local Addiction Services, the 
most common reason given by youth for drug abuse is boredom.)<br/>• 
Provide opportunities to host events, shows &amp; jams (competitions), 
presenting skating in a format that people can understand &amp; 
appreciate. Skateboarding is a great spectator sport!<br/>• Provide 
opportunities for “hard to reach, non-joining youth” to get involved in 
the community &amp; foster creativity as each skater develops his own 
personal style and skills</p>
<p>According to veteran skateboarder Dan 
Hughes, “Skateboarding reaches these “at risk” youth, like no other 
sport. And it’s cool too. But, people are out of touch with what is 
happening, and just want to get these annoying skateboarders out of 
their hair. All the while, kids are learning that as skaters they are 
second-class citizens. Yet, it’s these same skateboarders who are 
learning a valuable work ethic. Because, believe me, if you don’t work 
hard and commit to a trick, you won’t land it. They also learn how to 
work independently, how to be creative, and develop their own 
style.”</p>
<p>• Provide social opportunities by bringing different ages and social 
groups together, encouraging interaction and appreciation of each other;
 bring families together who enjoy skating as a family<br/>• Empower 
youth by involving them fully in the process of establishing the park, 
enabling them to work with community elders, learning how government 
works &amp; how they can become more active citizens<br/>• Encourage 
youth to interact independently &amp; develop socially, learning how to 
take turns &amp; help each other learn new tricks<br/>• Mitigate street 
skating problems, protecting private &amp; public property from damage 
&amp; reducing police time required to follow up on complaints. For 
example, 75% of 24 communities surveyed by the City of Calgary in 1998, 
after their skatepark opened, reported a significant reduction in the 
skate problem.<br/>• Reduce pressure on hospitals as a result of reduced 
injuries from skating on rough surfaces and in traffic areas, i.e. 
street-skating. (According to Health Canada, only 5% of skateboarding 
injuries take place in skateparks.)<br/>• Provide a healthy release for pent-up aggression &amp; frustration<br/>•
 Teach the importance of a positive attitude &amp; belief in oneself. To
 progress in skateboarding, one must trust oneself &amp; believe that 
they can do it!<br/>• Provide economic benefits.</p>
<p>“Community Access to a variety of 
recreational opportunities encourages business investment from outside 
the community, acts as a driver for immigration, and encourages resident
 retention (particularly among youth). Destination marketing and tourism
 development are closely tied with the number and quality of recreation 
activities developed and available.”</p>
<p>A skatepark would fit well into Memphis Grizzlies' established slogan “<strong>Grit n Grind</strong>”<br/>-Grit defining Courage and Resolve; Strength of Character<br/>-Grind defining Work-ethic and Persistence; Mental and Physical Dedication to setting and completing Goals and literally grinding (obviously) <br/></p>
<p>Skateboarding is <b>HUGE</b>, just not hugely supported in Memphis.<br/></p>

<h3><a name=""community"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">How will this benefit the Memphis Youth?</a></h3>
<p>The myth surrounding skateparks is that they are a breeding ground 
for crime and other illicit activities. While there will be an 
occasional ""bad seed"", providing designated spaces for positive 
activities is the best way to curb unlawful behavior among youth. When 
the youth has nothing to do or nowhere to go - that is when they are 
more likely to cause trouble and risk not only other people's lives, but
 their own.<br/><br/>It's no secret that children who are involved in team
 sports don't have the time to get into trouble, but it turns out you 
don't have to drag them to the soccer field or baseball diamond. 
Activities you may not expect - like skateboarding - might be just what 
teens and adolescents need. Research out of the University of North 
Carolina found that skateboarding is among the activities that might 
help keep children out of trouble. Many adults who aren't involved in 
the skateboarding community see the group of boarders as being a little 
more on the risky side, but instead of being on the risky side, they are
 actually protected from those behaviors.<br/><br/>Source: <a href=""http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">NBC Philadelphia</a><br/>""Keeping Active is the Best way to keep kids out of trouble"" April 3, 2006<br/><br/>By
 all means, skateboarding can be a dangerous sport. It's indubitably 
dangerous when skating in the streets due to a lack in public skating 
parks, but what I believe is more dangerous than that are public parks 
that are open 24/7 with no lighting, weatherproofing, enforced 
regulations or supervision.<br/>An indoor, well-maintained, 
well-supervised, well-lit, well-ventilated and regulated skating 
facility would revoke illegal activity, destruction of public &amp; 
private property, violence, and unethical influence and allow skaters an
 opportunity to leave their homes and be active on days of bad weather; 
the healthy alternative to playing video games and watching Netflix.<br/><br/>One
 of the psycho-social benefits is to feel safe again. Reclaiming public 
spaces helps people feel like a community and the busier the place, the 
more appealing for the youth and the safer people feel.<br/><br/>The 
majority of skateboarding injuries happen outside of skateparks. The 
most common injuries are falls due to surface irregularities and 
collisions with motor vehicles or pedestrians. Skateboarding is going to
 happen whether skateparks exist or not, so the best way to keep youth 
safe is to provide to them access to positively influenced, safe, 
designated spaces to pursue their activity.</p>

<h3><a name=""risks"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Risks &amp; Challenges</a></h3>
<h3><a name=""risks"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></h3>
<p>There is not a single parks manager who doesn’t see a way to improve 
any  recreational facility. The challenges facing parks are everywhere; 
the expensive  maintenance costs of a new soccer field, finding 
qualified volunteers for an after-school program, or the lack of  land 
for an off-leash dog park. The  fact is that no recreational facility is
 without its particular needs  and no project is perfect in every way.</p>
<p>Skateparks
 are a relative newcomer to the Parks &amp; Recreation world  and it can
 be difficult to sort out all of the voices with something to  say. 
Attorneys deliver a list of policies and devices necessary  to mitigate 
liability. Planners have a short list of available sites  appropriate 
for this kind of development (if at all). Meanwhile, the  neighborhood 
delivers its own list of concerns about noise and nuisance. While this 
is all getting sorted out the skateboarders are recreating in the 
streets. The  business community is fed up with their ledges being 
ground down to  nothing and the police are writing tickets to skaters 
when they have better things to do. Everyone wants the new skatepark but
 few people can agree on what and where it should be, work together to volunteer or find the money to donate. This is where 
skateparks begin to fail.</p>
<p>We’re all familiar with the difficult 
environment in which skateparks  are expected to become successes. It 
should come as no surprise that  sometimes they fail to meet everyone’s 
expectations.  Hope is not lost! There are still options even when it 
feels like every  avenue has been explored.</p>Our biggest expenses will probably be <b>RENT </b>and <b>INSURANCE</b>.
 While providing services and products would be a great way to 
financially support brands &amp; businesses and the communities that 
support those brands &amp; businesses, we do not expect to cover insurance, rent, utility, employment, management and upkeep fees 
associated with owning a skatepark from these outlets alone (meaning we have other plans in place to generate income within and outside of the new facility).<br/><br/>We hope to find a <b>SPACE</b> large enough to include a parking lot for plenty of parking space - an indoor park large enough to allow simultaneous use by boarders, inline skaters and bikers safely - and a building large enough to include multiple rooms for retail, creative opportunities for partners/customers/clients/members, the park (of course), shows (that don't interrupt park activity) and large events (like televised board/bike/skate competitions, club parties and fashion shows  -  things that would increase community involvement, consumer spending &amp; drive <b>INCOME </b>to help fund park maintenance, employment, product design &amp; manufacturing, advertising, sponsorships and overheads.<br/>While searching for a place to call home, we have to consider thing like <b>LICENSING</b>,<b></b> <b>ZONING CLEARANCE </b>and <b>PERMITS </b>(for clubbing, indoor parks, commerce, broadcasting, etc)<br/><br/>Building a concrete park will be <b>EXPENSIVE</b>. The advantage is that maintenance costs will decrease drastically. Buying (not renting) a building will be <b>VERY EXPENSIVE</b>. The advantage, though, is that we (park users) can make the rules and make any decisions necessary for the satisfaction and safety of our community.<br/><br/><b>DESIGN</b> is commonly an issue. Fortunately, <a href=""http://californiaskateparks.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">California Skateparks</a> has one of the best reputations in skatepark-building history. Unfortunately, they're not architects. We're still searching for the right architect for the job.<br/><br/><b>TIME </b>is a major concern. Will the park open this year? Lets be realistic - probably not, considering the goals we've set and are determined to achieve.<br/><br/><b>SUPPORT </b>- Under-funding a facility that is expected to meet the needs for the entire local community AND attract visitors. Skateboarders aren't millionaires. Not even some of the best professionals. Mid-level skaters earn $50 to $100K a year, while the really good guys make between $500K and <b>$1 million</b>. But how much of that do they have to fund a park? How much of that do they actually keep?
 But believe it or not, it's rarely about the money. Basically skaters 
get paid to do what they would be doing anyway, which is trying to skate
 better than the laws of physics allow."" Most amateur skaters don't have enough money in their pockets to replace the skateboard they just broke and if they do, they've usually already got in mind where they're going to spend it and what they're going to buy. Our funding is likely to come from investors, parents, sponsors and ourselves (with pleasure). <br/><br/><b>LOW CAPACITY</b> - Underestimating the value of (and not planning for) the skatepark as a social space to the local youth. Seating and other aspects of design that make the space comfortable and inviting are very important to the long-term health of the park. If the facility is designed to handle this social function it will be that much better off. When the popularity of the new skatepark is underestimated, particularly when site amenities and the surroundings are not designed to be social spaces, behavior at the park can become unruly. <br/><br/><b>OPPORTUNITY </b>- Embarking upon the process of creating a new skatepark is a great opportunity to embrace a popular and fascinating youth activity. The new park should be seen as a boon to the community that will be VERY popular with the youth. With proper planning and good decisions, the skatepark will be a landmark for the entire community. This is a rare and exciting opportunity.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://assets.ubuntu.com/sites/ubuntu/515/u/img/campaigns/22072013_gogo/graphics/hr-01.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h4>We have <strike>three</strike> two options:</h4>
<p><b>1.)</b> Find a location and building (usually a warehouse space) 
big enough to include a spacious parking lot, seating (for shows, 
competitions and jams) and floor space (for broadcasters and film gear 
during events), and a skatepark big enough to include efficient design 
for: sectioning (to give bikers, boarders and inline skaters access to a
 particular section during a 30 minute session if needed), skill level 
(to give young children or beginners a safe section to practice and 
progress) and ride-ability (to ensure the entire park can be utilized 
and enjoyed at it's utmost potential for each rider's style and 
preference).</p>
<p><b>2.)</b> Find an empty lot for reasons mentioned above and build a 
brand new facility. (preferred over renovating or experiencing design 
limitations with existing lots)</p>
<p>(We think we've found the perfect spot downtown near the Pyramid 
where we can drive visitor traffic and increase sales for nearby 
businesses, but we're still doing research on zoning and permits. If 
you've got information that may beneficial to us, please email <a href=""mailto:support@theskateparkofmemphis.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">support@theskateparkofmemphis.com</a>)
</p>
<p><b>3.)</b> <strike>Build a free, outdoor skatepark</strike> Memphis 
already has a few of these and they are GREAT! If we decided to raise 
money to build a free outdoor park we, instead, would invest that money 
into improving the existing parks to make them safer, more enjoyable, 
well lit and more complete. For example: <br/><br/>-We would add a pool (or pools, 
and we don't mean a swimming pool), dedicated lighting and more seating 
with outdoor heaters to the Houston High park

 Memphis' ridiculous weather and lack of necessary resources and space 
make it hard for kids, young adults and long-time riders to fully enjoy 
skateboarding outdoors. We don't want to discourage support for local 
parks, instead we'd love to give Memphis skaters, bikers and visitors 
from all over the world the opportunity to enjoy a full day's worth of 
skateboarding and have access to a clean, ventilated and safe 
community-driven environment. These existing parks are VERY important to
 the Memphis skateboarding 
community and <strike>if</strike> <b>when </b>the opportunities unfold, our investments into these parks and their supporting communities are guaranteed.<br/><p></p>

<h4>
<a name=""faq"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Quick Answers to FAQs &amp; Replys to Concerns</a><br/>
</h4>
<p><b>Q: Will you let bikes in? That would be amazing. </b><br/><b>R:</b> Our plan is to have a park both safe and enough for inline, skate and bmx.</p>
<p><b>C: Looks shady. Who asks for public donations to fund a private business?</b><br/><b>R:</b> We do. Reason being, the original SPOM closed down for a few reasons<br/>1. The owners of the wooden park were renting a property.<br/>2. After 7 years, the owners of that property decided to sell the property.<br/>3. A MGMT company took over the property and required the park to back-pay five years of unpaid maintenance fees although the previous property owner had made an agreement with the park owners that they didn't have to pay those fees.<br/>4. By law, the park was forced to pay $30,000 or shut down.<br/>5. The owners had a shop at the park, but a shop definitely does not bring enough income alone to fund the rent and maintenance of a wooden park.<br/>5. Because the money wasn't there, the EPIC Memphis Era had to come to an end.</p>
<p><b>Q: Why should I fund a private park?</b><br/><b>A: </b>If we don't own the park, we don't make the rules. Profits made (if any) would be invested back into improvement of the park, additions to the park, alterations, fund street league-style events, grow the skateboarding community and professional athlete involvement therefore giving local skaters an opportunity to grow in the sport, and give Memphis' youthful skating community a place to go and grow.</p>
<p><b>C: There isn't enough demand to support an indoor skatepark in Memphis, or else there would already be one...<br/>R:</b> Do you mean ""There isn't enough demand"" or do you meant ""There isn't enough support""? It's all about perspective. With over 300 impressions 1 day into the campaign, I think this is something people have been wanting for a while. There just aren't enough people out there with a GO-GETTER attitude trying to make something happen for the benefit of others. Memphis' support system for independent talents, small businesses, relationships, self-improvement, success, the youth....(I could go on and on)... has kind-of gone to shit. Our community doesn't really feel inspired to do anything unless they know they'll see results tomorrow - unless they know it's going to benefit them in some kind of way - unless it tears down their competition. <br/>See, I'm not about competition, or tearing people down. I'm not about doing everything for the benefit of myself and having that 9-5 job barely making enough to feed my snake (who only needs to eat once a month) and skating at free parks or in the cove every time I want to get on a board, because every time I've I wanted to go out and get on board, the weather said NO. The neighbors complained. The park was dirty. No one being at the public park and the sun nearly generating a cup-full of sweat and the built-up dirt at the bottom of the banks -- weren't worth my almost empty tank of gas. Any request to change or fix an issue at a public park (cracks or a broken rail) or add, lets say, a bowl to the Houston High park is either denied or takes 15 years to finally be fulfilled. If we owned that park it would have been done either by us or with volunteer help of the people who truly wanted it. But because we don't own that park, we have to ask non-skateboarding politicians to do something that would benefit us, but they would have to pay for.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Q: Why is there so much to read?</h4>
<b>A:</b> Well, because there's so much to do and we don't have a campaign video (yet)<br/>We're waiting on video submissions from Memphis skaters to land in our inbox and those (usually) take a while to make. The organizers (myself and one other) are pretty busy researching, networking and spending hard-earned money trying to make this thing happen for you. You wouldn't have come this far down the page if you weren't remotely interested. Besides, reading is good practice for the mind and I encourage you to do so more often. A book I recommend reading is <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwibgNiTzNHKAhVK6mMKHWSyCAcQjxwIAw&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMental-Dynamics-Thinking-Personal-Success%2Fdp%2F0135664314&amp;psig=AFQjCNGdR6MdwdeqocJOqjmXX_OkZR7yCQ&amp;ust=1454245322385807"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mental Dynamics</a> by K.

<h4>Q: When will I receive my perk?</h4>
<p><b>A:</b> Receiving
 your perk(s) often takes time! Selecting a perk as a part 
of your contribution is not the same thing as buying something online. 
Perks may require much more than just money to develop, manufacture and 
distribute. Some perks will be received when our campaign reaches the 
particular milestone associated with that perk. For example, if you 
claimed the ""You've Got Mail"" perk, you'll be the first to know when we 
find a location - assuming that your address hasn't changed between now 
and then, you'll receive exclusive 'GRIT &amp; GRIND SPOM' stickers in 
the mail. </p>
<h4>Q: How will I be contacted if I'm the winner of a drawing?</h4>
<p><b>A:</b> Receiving your perk(s) often takes time! Selecting a perk as a part 
of your contribution is not the same thing as buying something online. 
Perks may require much more than just money to develop, manufacture and 
distribute.</p>
<h4>Q: Can I claim multiple perks?</h4>
<p><b>A:</b> It's
 exciting to hear that you've found multiple perks you are interested in
 claiming! Please note, at this time, we do not have a feature for you 
to be able to add multiple perks in a single transaction. As such, if 
you'd like to claim multiple perks, please make a new contribution for 
each perk.<br/>(<a href=""https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/526766-How-do-I-claim-a-Perk-"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Read More about perks here</a>)</p>

What We're Doing
(Where your money and our money is going)
A Brand New Entertainment and Personal Development Facility(Part 1 of our campaign is to fund the development of an indoor skatepark)
*Please note: We aren't 'Re-building' the Skatepark of Memphis that once existed.This is an entirely new project and we've been granted permission from previous owners to use the original name. Skatepark of Memphis was built with years of hard work, dedication and community support. We do not wish to discredit the family that spent their time and money to birth such a great experience for the Memphis alternative sports community, Memphis' independent music scene and the youth who contributed to the success of the park and it's name. We have a unique opportunity to make Memphis a part of the, now, mainstream sport.
The provision of a sport or recreation facility can significantly 
enhance the quality of life. Activities held within sport and recreation
 facilities can encourage participation, promote health and well-being 
and foster a sense of community. However, planning a sport or recreation
 facility is an involved and sometimes difficult task. Our project is big. OUR PROJECT IS HUGE and
 considering that this is an individual effort to support independent 
artists, designers, business owners, brands and, in general, creatives, 
The project may or may not be partially funded by the city/state 
and could take 1-3 years to be fully funded before construction begins. 
The park will be designed and constructed by California Skateparks.The photos below are rendered to represent quality and do NOT accurately represent architecture, park design, material use or scale.




In addition, our goal is to open a skate-bike-inline shop (featuring 
products from both local and well known brands) and a flagship popup 
shop featuring only products from sponsored artists, affiliate partners
& Memphis-based Indie apparel brands The Label Lust Apparel + Affiliated Partners like ME Skateboarding Co.The photos below are rendered to represent quality and minimalist taste but do NOT accurately represent architecture, shop design, material use or scale.


The Skatepark of Memphis will be a privately owned park. In an effort
 to support local independent talent, local small and big independently 
owned businesses, provide job and internship opportunities, education, 
relationship and wealth building strategies to the Memphis community, 
the Indoor skatepark and surrounding facilities (eg. apparel design, 
recording, photography, videography, visual art, technology, dance, 
business network and digital branding studios) will be accessible via 
monthly/annual memberships or pay-per-day and pay-per-session rates. 
This would allow us to keep the park open forever and could allow us to 
keep the lights on 24/7. The facility will be constructed with 
state-of-the art materials and technology and the park itself would be 
constructed with concrete, minimizing hazards and upkeep costs.

A Professionally Designed Concrete Skatepark Will: • Provide a safe challenging place for skateboarding (and similar extreme sports), allowing participants to develop as athletes•
 Provide an alternative to team sports, to develop motor skills & 
balance in youth and the young-at-heart. Playgrounds are provided for 
younger children, but for older youth who don’t participate in team 
sports, there is often nothing.• Attract visitors (skatepark 
enthusiasts & spectators) who enjoy skateboarding & similar 
extreme sports. When people visit they spend money!• Make community 
more youth-friendly & give youth the message that they’re accepted 
& valued members of the community, by giving them a place to call 
their own & a creative outlet to express themselves• Provide 
opportunity for healthy activity for youth, helping curb problems of 
inactivity & drug abuse (According to local Addiction Services, the 
most common reason given by youth for drug abuse is boredom.)• 
Provide opportunities to host events, shows & jams (competitions), 
presenting skating in a format that people can understand & 
appreciate. Skateboarding is a great spectator sport!• Provide 
opportunities for “hard to reach, non-joining youth” to get involved in 
the community & foster creativity as each skater develops his own 
personal style and skills
According to veteran skateboarder Dan 
Hughes, “Skateboarding reaches these “at risk” youth, like no other 
sport. And it’s cool too. But, people are out of touch with what is 
happening, and just want to get these annoying skateboarders out of 
their hair. All the while, kids are learning that as skaters they are 
second-class citizens. Yet, it’s these same skateboarders who are 
learning a valuable work ethic. Because, believe me, if you don’t work 
hard and commit to a trick, you won’t land it. They also learn how to 
work independently, how to be creative, and develop their own 
style.”
• Provide social opportunities by bringing different ages and social 
groups together, encouraging interaction and appreciation of each other;
 bring families together who enjoy skating as a family• Empower 
youth by involving them fully in the process of establishing the park, 
enabling them to work with community elders, learning how government 
works & how they can become more active citizens• Encourage 
youth to interact independently & develop socially, learning how to 
take turns & help each other learn new tricks• Mitigate street 
skating problems, protecting private & public property from damage 
& reducing police time required to follow up on complaints. For 
example, 75% of 24 communities surveyed by the City of Calgary in 1998, 
after their skatepark opened, reported a significant reduction in the 
skate problem.• Reduce pressure on hospitals as a result of reduced 
injuries from skating on rough surfaces and in traffic areas, i.e. 
street-skating. (According to Health Canada, only 5% of skateboarding 
injuries take place in skateparks.)• Provide a healthy release for pent-up aggression & frustration•
 Teach the importance of a positive attitude & belief in oneself. To
 progress in skateboarding, one must trust oneself & believe that 
they can do it!• Provide economic benefits.
“Community Access to a variety of 
recreational opportunities encourages business investment from outside 
the community, acts as a driver for immigration, and encourages resident
 retention (particularly among youth). Destination marketing and tourism
 development are closely tied with the number and quality of recreation 
activities developed and available.”
A skatepark would fit well into Memphis Grizzlies' established slogan “Grit n Grind”-Grit defining Courage and Resolve; Strength of Character-Grind defining Work-ethic and Persistence; Mental and Physical Dedication to setting and completing Goals and literally grinding (obviously) 
Skateboarding is HUGE, just not hugely supported in Memphis.
Thanks to Jim Barnum of Spectrum Skateparks and California Skateparks for many of the above ideas.

How will this benefit the Memphis Youth?
The myth surrounding skateparks is that they are a breeding ground 
for crime and other illicit activities. While there will be an 
occasional ""bad seed"", providing designated spaces for positive 
activities is the best way to curb unlawful behavior among youth. When 
the youth has nothing to do or nowhere to go - that is when they are 
more likely to cause trouble and risk not only other people's lives, but
 their own.It's no secret that children who are involved in team
 sports don't have the time to get into trouble, but it turns out you 
don't have to drag them to the soccer field or baseball diamond. 
Activities you may not expect - like skateboarding - might be just what 
teens and adolescents need. Research out of the University of North 
Carolina found that skateboarding is among the activities that might 
help keep children out of trouble. Many adults who aren't involved in 
the skateboarding community see the group of boarders as being a little 
more on the risky side, but instead of being on the risky side, they are
 actually protected from those behaviors.Source: NBC Philadelphia""Keeping Active is the Best way to keep kids out of trouble"" April 3, 2006By
 all means, skateboarding can be a dangerous sport. It's indubitably 
dangerous when skating in the streets due to a lack in public skating 
parks, but what I believe is more dangerous than that are public parks 
that are open 24/7 with no lighting, weatherproofing, enforced 
regulations or supervision.An indoor, well-maintained, 
well-supervised, well-lit, well-ventilated and regulated skating 
facility would revoke illegal activity, destruction of public & 
private property, violence, and unethical influence and allow skaters an
 opportunity to leave their homes and be active on days of bad weather; 
the healthy alternative to playing video games and watching Netflix.One
 of the psycho-social benefits is to feel safe again. Reclaiming public 
spaces helps people feel like a community and the busier the place, the 
more appealing for the youth and the safer people feel.The 
majority of skateboarding injuries happen outside of skateparks. The 
most common injuries are falls due to surface irregularities and 
collisions with motor vehicles or pedestrians. Skateboarding is going to
 happen whether skateparks exist or not, so the best way to keep youth 
safe is to provide to them access to positively influenced, safe, 
designated spaces to pursue their activity.

Risks & Challenges

There is not a single parks manager who doesn’t see a way to improve 
any  recreational facility. The challenges facing parks are everywhere; 
the expensive  maintenance costs of a new soccer field, finding 
qualified volunteers for an after-school program, or the lack of  land 
for an off-leash dog park. The  fact is that no recreational facility is
 without its particular needs  and no project is perfect in every way.
Skateparks
 are a relative newcomer to the Parks & Recreation world  and it can
 be difficult to sort out all of the voices with something to  say. 
Attorneys deliver a list of policies and devices necessary  to mitigate 
liability. Planners have a short list of available sites  appropriate 
for this kind of development (if at all). Meanwhile, the  neighborhood 
delivers its own list of concerns about noise and nuisance. While this 
is all getting sorted out the skateboarders are recreating in the 
streets. The  business community is fed up with their ledges being 
ground down to  nothing and the police are writing tickets to skaters 
when they have better things to do. Everyone wants the new skatepark but
 few people can agree on what and where it should be, work together to volunteer or find the money to donate. This is where 
skateparks begin to fail.
We’re all familiar with the difficult 
environment in which skateparks  are expected to become successes. It 
should come as no surprise that  sometimes they fail to meet everyone’s 
expectations.  Hope is not lost! There are still options even when it 
feels like every  avenue has been explored.Our biggest expenses will probably be RENT and INSURANCE.
 While providing services and products would be a great way to 
financially support brands & businesses and the communities that 
support those brands & businesses, we do not expect to cover insurance, rent, utility, employment, management and upkeep fees 
associated with owning a skatepark from these outlets alone (meaning we have other plans in place to generate income within and outside of the new facility).We hope to find a SPACE large enough to include a parking lot for plenty of parking space - an indoor park large enough to allow simultaneous use by boarders, inline skaters and bikers safely - and a building large enough to include multiple rooms for retail, creative opportunities for partners/customers/clients/members, the park (of course), shows (that don't interrupt park activity) and large events (like televised board/bike/skate competitions, club parties and fashion shows  -  things that would increase community involvement, consumer spending & drive INCOME to help fund park maintenance, employment, product design & manufacturing, advertising, sponsorships and overheads.While searching for a place to call home, we have to consider thing like LICENSING, ZONING CLEARANCE and PERMITS (for clubbing, indoor parks, commerce, broadcasting, etc)Building a concrete park will be EXPENSIVE. The advantage is that maintenance costs will decrease drastically. Buying (not renting) a building will be VERY EXPENSIVE. The advantage, though, is that we (park users) can make the rules and make any decisions necessary for the satisfaction and safety of our community.DESIGN is commonly an issue. Fortunately, California Skateparks has one of the best reputations in skatepark-building history. Unfortunately, they're not architects. We're still searching for the right architect for the job.TIME is a major concern. Will the park open this year? Lets be realistic - probably not, considering the goals we've set and are determined to achieve.SUPPORT - Under-funding a facility that is expected to meet the needs for the entire local community AND attract visitors. Skateboarders aren't millionaires. Not even some of the best professionals. Mid-level skaters earn $50 to $100K a year, while the really good guys make between $500K and $1 million. But how much of that do they have to fund a park? How much of that do they actually keep?
 But believe it or not, it's rarely about the money. Basically skaters 
get paid to do what they would be doing anyway, which is trying to skate
 better than the laws of physics allow."" Most amateur skaters don't have enough money in their pockets to replace the skateboard they just broke and if they do, they've usually already got in mind where they're going to spend it and what they're going to buy. Our funding is likely to come from investors, parents, sponsors and ourselves (with pleasure). LOW CAPACITY - Underestimating the value of (and not planning for) the skatepark as a social space to the local youth. Seating and other aspects of design that make the space comfortable and inviting are very important to the long-term health of the park. If the facility is designed to handle this social function it will be that much better off. When the popularity of the new skatepark is underestimated, particularly when site amenities and the surroundings are not designed to be social spaces, behavior at the park can become unruly. OPPORTUNITY - Embarking upon the process of creating a new skatepark is a great opportunity to embrace a popular and fascinating youth activity. The new park should be seen as a boon to the community that will be VERY popular with the youth. With proper planning and good decisions, the skatepark will be a landmark for the entire community. This is a rare and exciting opportunity.

We have three two options:
1.) Find a location and building (usually a warehouse space) 
big enough to include a spacious parking lot, seating (for shows, 
competitions and jams) and floor space (for broadcasters and film gear 
during events), and a skatepark big enough to include efficient design 
for: sectioning (to give bikers, boarders and inline skaters access to a
 particular section during a 30 minute session if needed), skill level 
(to give young children or beginners a safe section to practice and 
progress) and ride-ability (to ensure the entire park can be utilized 
and enjoyed at it's utmost potential for each rider's style and 
preference).
2.) Find an empty lot for reasons mentioned above and build a 
brand new facility. (preferred over renovating or experiencing design 
limitations with existing lots)
(We think we've found the perfect spot downtown near the Pyramid 
where we can drive visitor traffic and increase sales for nearby 
businesses, but we're still doing research on zoning and permits. If 
you've got information that may beneficial to us, please email support@theskateparkofmemphis.com)

3.) Build a free, outdoor skatepark Memphis 
already has a few of these and they are GREAT! If we decided to raise 
money to build a free outdoor park we, instead, would invest that money 
into improving the existing parks to make them safer, more enjoyable, 
well lit and more complete. For example: -We would add a pool (or pools, 
and we don't mean a swimming pool), dedicated lighting and more seating 
with outdoor heaters to the Houston High park

- Expand and add concrete 
sections and lighting to Southaven Skate Park- Add lighting to Tobey 
park- And of course we'd do whatever we can for the DIY guys over at 
ALTOWN.Often,
 Memphis' ridiculous weather and lack of necessary resources and space 
make it hard for kids, young adults and long-time riders to fully enjoy 
skateboarding outdoors. We don't want to discourage support for local 
parks, instead we'd love to give Memphis skaters, bikers and visitors 
from all over the world the opportunity to enjoy a full day's worth of 
skateboarding and have access to a clean, ventilated and safe 
community-driven environment. These existing parks are VERY important to
 the Memphis skateboarding 
community and if when the opportunities unfold, our investments into these parks and their supporting communities are guaranteed.

C: Looks shady. Who asks for public donations to fund a private business?R: We do. Reason being, the original SPOM closed down for a few reasons1. The owners of the wooden park were renting a property.2. After 7 years, the owners of that property decided to sell the property.3. A MGMT company took over the property and required the park to back-pay five years of unpaid maintenance fees although the previous property owner had made an agreement with the park owners that they didn't have to pay those fees.4. By law, the park was forced to pay $30,000 or shut down.5. The owners had a shop at the park, but a shop definitely does not bring enough income alone to fund the rent and maintenance of a wooden park.5. Because the money wasn't there, the EPIC Memphis Era had to come to an end.
Q: Why should I fund a private park?A: If we don't own the park, we don't make the rules. Profits made (if any) would be invested back into improvement of the park, additions to the park, alterations, fund street league-style events, grow the skateboarding community and professional athlete involvement therefore giving local skaters an opportunity to grow in the sport, and give Memphis' youthful skating community a place to go and grow.
C: There isn't enough demand to support an indoor skatepark in Memphis, or else there would already be one...R: Do you mean ""There isn't enough demand"" or do you meant ""There isn't enough support""? It's all about perspective. With over 300 impressions 1 day into the campaign, I think this is something people have been wanting for a while. There just aren't enough people out there with a GO-GETTER attitude trying to make something happen for the benefit of others. Memphis' support system for independent talents, small businesses, relationships, self-improvement, success, the youth....(I could go on and on)... has kind-of gone to shit. Our community doesn't really feel inspired to do anything unless they know they'll see results tomorrow - unless they know it's going to benefit them in some kind of way - unless it tears down their competition. See, I'm not about competition, or tearing people down. I'm not about doing everything for the benefit of myself and having that 9-5 job barely making enough to feed my snake (who only needs to eat once a month) and skating at free parks or in the cove every time I want to get on a board, because every time I've I wanted to go out and get on board, the weather said NO. The neighbors complained. The park was dirty. No one being at the public park and the sun nearly generating a cup-full of sweat and the built-up dirt at the bottom of the banks -- weren't worth my almost empty tank of gas. Any request to change or fix an issue at a public park (cracks or a broken rail) or add, lets say, a bowl to the Houston High park is either denied or takes 15 years to finally be fulfilled. If we owned that park it would have been done either by us or with volunteer help of the people who truly wanted it. But because we don't own that park, we have to ask non-skateboarding politicians to do something that would benefit us, but they would have to pay for.

Q: Why is there so much to read?
A: Well, because there's so much to do and we don't have a campaign video (yet)We're waiting on video submissions from Memphis skaters to land in our inbox and those (usually) take a while to make. The organizers (myself and one other) are pretty busy researching, networking and spending hard-earned money trying to make this thing happen for you. You wouldn't have come this far down the page if you weren't remotely interested. Besides, reading is good practice for the mind and I encourage you to do so more often. A book I recommend reading is Mental Dynamics by K. Thomas Finley.

Q: When will I receive my perk?
A: Receiving
 your perk(s) often takes time! Selecting a perk as a part 
of your contribution is not the same thing as buying something online. 
Perks may require much more than just money to develop, manufacture and 
distribute. Some perks will be received when our campaign reaches the 
particular milestone associated with that perk. For example, if you 
claimed the ""You've Got Mail"" perk, you'll be the first to know when we 
find a location - assuming that your address hasn't changed between now 
and then, you'll receive exclusive 'GRIT & GRIND SPOM' stickers in 
the mail. 
Q: How will I be contacted if I'm the winner of a drawing?
A: Receiving your perk(s) often takes time! Selecting a perk as a part 
of your contribution is not the same thing as buying something online. 
Perks may require much more than just money to develop, manufacture and 
distribute.
Q: Can I claim multiple perks?
A: It's
 exciting to hear that you've found multiple perks you are interested in
 claiming! Please note, at this time, we do not have a feature for you 
to be able to add multiple perks in a single transaction. As such, if 
you'd like to claim multiple perks, please make a new contribution for 
each perk.(Read More about perks here)

“Entertainment” companies are more-so interested in making a dollar than
providing their clients with the opportunity to do the same. We do not solely
consider our customers “Clients”, but instead, Partners. That is what sets
our agency apart from our competition. Entering a joint agreement as individual
businesses & brands with a common goal to generate residual revenue

<ul> </ul> <p>My name is Bailey and I'm going to tell you a little story. Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Kelly. One day, Kelly was driving with her father, Joe, and looked down, noticing that the floorboards were littered with coffee cups. Perplexed, she asked, ""Dad, why do you drink coffee in the summer?"" He smiled and questioned back, ""Why do you eat ice cream in the winter?"" She made the connection and nodded her head, continuing on her day.</p>
<p>On multiple other occasions, Kelly was either sent into the convenience store to make his coffee or she made it at home. You would think that a girl would hate to have an extra chore, but that is not the way she looked at it. One day after she got her father's coffee, he smiled and told her that she makes the best coffee in the world, even better than her sisters, which she appreciated a lot, being the youngest of the three. </p>
<p>It wasn't until the fateful day in 1992 when Kelly's world would change forever. Round Valley Reservoir in Lebanon, NJ. Scuba Diving Accident. Air Embolism to the brain. Kelly was 12 years-old, swarmed with heartache, along with her two sisters Jodi and Stacy, and their mother, Donna. </p>
<p>Kelly is my mother. Again, my name is Bailey. So let's lighten the air a bit. I'm Kelly's daughter and I currently am employed at Java Joe's, a cozy, little coffee shop in Beachwood, NJ that my mom decided to open up to carry on my grandfather's legacy. After all, the famous Java Joe said it himself, my mom makes the best coffee in the world, so I'd say that was a smart move on her part. </p>
<p>Small businesses and mom&amp;pop shops are rapidly becoming a ""forgotten art"" if you will, becoming swallowed up by the endless chains of commercial retailers and restaurants. Our little shop is getting such good reviews and publicity, but good words can only take us so far. I want to surprise my mom with any amount of money that could potentially improve the financial situation we're in now. She wants to make improvements. She wants to advertise. Quality is a top priority. In order to do enhance our family business, I was hoping to gain the help of my community and anyone around the country who is willing enough to help out my mom and to keep the dreams of honoring her father alive. </p> </div> <div> <h3>A VERY IMPORTANT REQUEST</h3>
<div>This is a surprise for my mother. I don't want to spoil the surprise until everything is finalized. Feel free to like Java Joe's on Facebook, but try and refrain from tagging us in anything that has to do with this fundraiser. If you stop into the shop, please don't say anything to my mom. Thank you all!</div>
<h3>The Funds We Get</h3>
<div>Ultimately, the funds will go to the shop in general, and serve to make various improvements around the shop. More glasses, a better security system, or anything that helps the shop run smoother for not only the staff, but the customers as well.

<p>My
name is Linda Nebēdniece. I am a musician, raw foodist and mother of
two daughters. There is a scenic place in Latvia called Pērļukrāces
where I assemble people who are interested in ecological, healthy and
alternative way of living. My biggest dream is to create a place and
community where people can feel them selves free, self sustainable,
natural and positive.  All of this is happening already at my house:
we are building with natural materials such as clay and straw,
growing ecological produce without pesticides, we are cooking
vegetarian meals, singing powerful songs, dancing Latvian traditional
dances, making our psalteries (or kokle in Latvian), celebrating
solstice, organizing camps and other activities.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443596135/wignqox3dnhxp1sbxkvw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>For me and my friends this is not a experiment, we really do live like this. Latvian traditional way of life is something deep-minded and beautiful, it's like a part of us, inside our cells. I can't imagine a day without playing psaltery, lighting a wood-burning stove, walking bare foot, meditating in a meadow..

<p></p>
<h3>Why we need your help </h3>
<p>This
place Pērļukrāces has became dear to my family and friends,
visitors. It's our third year living here and during this time with
the help of our friends we have made this place much more beautiful
and comfortable for living. All of this time owners of this house
allowed us to live here without charge, but now they want to sell
this place. We are privileged to be the first ones to make an offer
and buy this place. We don't have a lot of time, because our neighbor
is interested in buying the land and forest around the house. The
neighbor is wealthy and willing to buy, but we are limited in money.
If he buys this place, he will grow grains using chemical fertilizers
and that will pollute the river which runs by the property. He will
most certainly cut the forest. Even if the house still stays as ours,
this beautiful place will loose it's charm. For the community this
has been a place free of stress, communications and commerce, but now
all of this is endangered. 
</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why exactly this place?</h3>

</div></div>","Who are we

My
name is Linda Nebēdniece. I am a musician, raw foodist and mother of
two daughters. There is a scenic place in Latvia called Pērļukrāces
where I assemble people who are interested in ecological, healthy and
alternative way of living. My biggest dream is to create a place and
community where people can feel them selves free, self sustainable,
natural and positive.  All of this is happening already at my house:
we are building with natural materials such as clay and straw,
growing ecological produce without pesticides, we are cooking
vegetarian meals, singing powerful songs, dancing Latvian traditional
dances, making our psalteries (or kokle in Latvian), celebrating
solstice, organizing camps and other activities.


For me and my friends this is not a experiment, we really do live like this. Latvian traditional way of life is something deep-minded and beautiful, it's like a part of us, inside our cells. I can't imagine a day without playing psaltery, lighting a wood-burning stove, walking bare foot, meditating in a meadow..


Why we need your help 
This
place Pērļukrāces has became dear to my family and friends,
visitors. It's our third year living here and during this time with
the help of our friends we have made this place much more beautiful
and comfortable for living. All of this time owners of this house
allowed us to live here without charge, but now they want to sell
this place. We are privileged to be the first ones to make an offer
and buy this place. We don't have a lot of time, because our neighbor
is interested in buying the land and forest around the house. The
neighbor is wealthy and willing to buy, but we are limited in money.
If he buys this place, he will grow grains using chemical fertilizers
and that will pollute the river which runs by the property. He will
most certainly cut the forest. Even if the house still stays as ours,
this beautiful place will loose it's charm. For the community this
has been a place free of stress, communications and commerce, but now
all of this is endangered. 


Why exactly this place?


It'
s not easy to explain, but everyone who comes here, starts to
understand why. A lot of people have said they feel high vibrations
in these surroundings, especially in Druviena, Silmači. Poruka
museum, Dievlejas, Ielejas, Kļaviņi and other local places. People who
live here have always loved the earth, water, sun, traditional songs
and music instruments, wood-crafting, connection with the cycles of
nature.

My vision

I'm
sure that with time this place will grow even more. as a location for
spiritual and healthy living people. At this moment it's a special
place in Latvia, but in near future it might became known outside the
borders of this country. A lot of people have showed their interest
to come visit and take part in things that happen here. 



There
is a plan to continue organizing raw-food camps and master classes in

What we need...
At
this point we have 5000 euros. In order to buy the house, forest (4
hectares) and the land (6 hectares) we need 20 000 euros.


I

through different situations and people. It's a kind of a unwritten

friend, if you can support us even just with the smallest amount of

will always be a welcomed visitor in Pērļukrāces.

<p>Our party is made up of a valiant businesswoman, Trisha Peters. Our fearless leader has high ranks in a variety of merchant skills. She is assisted by a tech wizard Alicia Secord, an artificer Rob Lifton, and a trusted apprentice Alyssa Long. This core party is just a small part of this adventure. Our future customers and friends are vital to reaching our goal. And the rewards will be plentiful.</p>
<p>We know that vape shops are popping up all over, but we will be more than just another shop. We will create a unique environment in which vape enthusiasts can purchase supplies, try a new juice, and pitch new ideas that we are willing to help bring to fruition. We will have pens, mechs, and an assortment of juices to appeal to the first time vaper or someone that is sure that they've tried it all. </p>
<p>Although our concentration is going to be on the vape side of things, we are also passionate about gaming. As long time gamers, we want to be your place to try out new games (rpg or other tabletop). We want to bring new, interesting games to your table. We will carry the favorites, but we want to encourage creators to bring new games to life.</p>

</div></div>","We want to create a space unlike any other that we have found. A place where people from the vaping community and gamers can come to purchase supplies, swap stories and create new tales that start out, ""Remember that time at D20 ...""
So who is this we?
Our party is made up of a valiant businesswoman, Trisha Peters. Our fearless leader has high ranks in a variety of merchant skills. She is assisted by a tech wizard Alicia Secord, an artificer Rob Lifton, and a trusted apprentice Alyssa Long. This core party is just a small part of this adventure. Our future customers and friends are vital to reaching our goal. And the rewards will be plentiful.
We know that vape shops are popping up all over, but we will be more than just another shop. We will create a unique environment in which vape enthusiasts can purchase supplies, try a new juice, and pitch new ideas that we are willing to help bring to fruition. We will have pens, mechs, and an assortment of juices to appeal to the first time vaper or someone that is sure that they've tried it all. 
Although our concentration is going to be on the vape side of things, we are also passionate about gaming. As long time gamers, we want to be your place to try out new games (rpg or other tabletop). We want to bring new, interesting games to your table. We will carry the favorites, but we want to encourage creators to bring new games to life.
 We want to be your store. We want your investment as a community, not just your money (although we'll take that, too). Which is why we decided to turn to IndieGoGo.
There's a thing that happens when people come together to share something: A community arises and connections are made. While gaming practically demands a group of 2 or more people to function, vaping can -- in theory -- occur in a vacuum. But let's be honest, when you started vaping it likely was because someone took  you to a vape shop.  So, when we started thinking, ""Let's open a vape shop,"" the gaming side of things coalesced quickly, as well, because the only thing we like more than sitting around doing one of those things for hours is sitting around doing both of those things for hours. And when we started exploring funding options, we started finding tons of board and card games and even vaporizer mods that we wanted to order from Kickstarter and Indigogo. And we realized that this was the community we wanted to be a part of. Yes, we need additional start-up funding, but we want it to come in a way that allows us to pay forward rather than back.

<h3>Crucible Brewing - Our Story So Far</h3>
<p>Opening Crucible Brewing in 2015 has been, literally, a dream come true for us. From our humble beginnings as passionate homebrewers we started on a road that brought us to where we are today. There have been days that we have struggled, days of long hours, and hard work. This is the reality of opening a small business. But we love what we do. We love beer. And we love seeing the excitement and the enthusiasm of our patrons and local community. The community that has become our backbone and resolve. Because of our kick ass community, every day has been an incredible day doing what we love, and loving what we do...oh and the beer certainly helps! ;-)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508447615/r0mvd30wru7zonk9uteb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Community</h3>
<p>With the original founding location of Crucible Brewing: The Foundry, in Everett, we noticed something incredible. It's not something we noticed right away because, frankly... we arent that smart. What we noticed is that the local brewery has become the spot where the neighborhood gathers. Where people from all walks of life, all trades and backgrounds, meet. Converse. Share the stories of their day. And share their birthdays and special occasions with loved ones. The community is who we make our beer for. It's because of this growing awareness that we decided it was time to grow with our community.</p>

<h3>The Future</h3>
<p>With the addition of our new production brewery and taproom, the Woodinville Forge, our dream got a little bigger. With our acquisition of the brewery equipment, assets, and location of 12 Bar Brews we now have the tools to share our love of beer with the greater Washington Beer Community. We are asking that you trust in our dream and help us to grow into the brewery that we know we can be. We wont stop till we can make sure that you can enjoy Crucible beer wherever you go: at home, at your favorite restaurant or bottle shop, at work (wouldn't THAT make Mondays go faster...) and beyond.</p>

""Community Development through Social Entrepreneurship"" project has initiated a campaign aiming to raise money for at least 10 active members of the 7 regions of Armenia to start successful business projects and donate their profit to the social welfare of their communities.


The future social entrepreneurs have already received the necessary trainings to start and run successful social enterprises, but don’t have the complete funds to start up. The social impact of these 10 projects will not only reduce the unemployment and emigration, but will also address the environment, inclusion, cultural heritage, social security etc. These are vital issues for Armenia, as well as any other part of the world which faces such problems.For the establishment and successful functioning of the social enterprises our change agents need seed money to start with. Each enterprise needs from $4,000 to $10,000 as presented in their business plans.To make sure your contributions are used effectively professional business coaching and consulting services will be provided to the beginning entrepreneurs for the first six months after establishment of the enterprises.Every dollar matters! You can choose to contribute the amount you wish.We have prepared a nice and wide variety of perks to remind you about the deep gratitude of the beneficiaries and the great action you did to make Armenia better! So, if you wish, please pick a perk from the suggested list below. The successful realization of our campaign will be a perfect illustration and encouragement for all those enthusiasts throughout the world who*believe in the idea and concept of social entrepreneurship*concern about the future generations*share the responsibility for the environment and the Nature*ready to change the world!

<h3>What is FostaParty? </h3>
<p>FostaParty is a nonprofit organization that specializes in children’s birthday parties. For every Sponsor Party we host for a paying customer, we throw one free Fosta Party for a child in the foster care system.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How it began </h3>
<p>In high school, our founder Khira Patel mentored a little girl who had been through the foster care system and was touched by her strength and resilience despite the adverse circumstances she had faced. This friendship is what sparked Khira’s passion to better the lives of foster children.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There are over 424,000 children in the foster care system on a given day who are less likely to have a positive childhood experience due to the traumatic nature of their upbringing. By throwing them a birthday party, we help these kids create positive memories and a knowingness that they are not a burden, but are loved and valued by the people around them.</p>
<p>When someone hires FostaParty to plan their child’s birthday, the profits from the event provide a free party for a child in the foster care system. Through our one-for-one model, we help families not only have fun, stress-free, and tax-deductible events, but also extend their goodwill and bridge the gap between two different communities. We imagine a world in which all children have the opportunity to have a positive childhood experience. FostaParty does that by throwing events that celebrate life, connect communities, and cherish memories. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>In the midst of a pandemic, throwing events can be challenging. FostaParty has been resilient to these changing environments and threw a virtual Fosta Party. We created an interactive experience by shipping a fully-decorated and themed box that included goody bags, decorations, presents, and a scrapbook to preserve memories for our Birthday Star. </p>
<p>We understand that we are working with a community that requires deep care and sensitivity. Navigating the intricacies of CPS can be time-consuming, but we are working to build our relationships with case workers and local agencies to ensure we are serving the families, children, and foster community in the best way possible. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>FostaParty is also seeking connections to corporate sponsors and grant opportunities to enable our organization to grow rapidly and serve the foster community as best we can.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are two brothers who live in Copenhagen, Denmark. One works as an animator and compositor and the other as a video director and editor. Even though we took a more artistic route than the rest of our engineer family, we have always had a love for constructing things: everything from Legos to video equipment such as dollytracks, skatedollys and glidecams. When we discovered 3D printing through the RepRap Project we realized that this technology would allow us to design things, and make a difference on a much bigger scale. We started to look for attainable goals, and for the last 6 months we have been working on our first project; the Kontinuum Garden.</p>
<h3>What is a Rotating Garden?</h3>
<p>The Kontinuum Garden is a hydroponic garden. It's a highly efficient rotating flood &amp; drain system (see: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroponics#Ebb_and_flow_or_flood_and_drain_sub-irrigation"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroponics#Ebb_and_flow_or_flood_and_drain_sub-irrigation</a>) that lets you grow fresh vegetables, fruits, herbs and even flowers in the comfort of your own home. It is easy to use, has minimal water consumption, produces high yields on a minimal area, and all without getting your hands dirty.</p>
<p>You can put them in your garage, home or perhaps a school. You could even get together with others in your community, designate an empty store, a building or an entire area to set up a place where everyone has free access to hydroponic food.</p>
<p>The Kontinuum Garden is our original design but of course we are familiar with the other designs that are on the market such as the Volksgarden, the RotoGro System, and the B-Pod etc. However, none of these gardens come with lights whereas the Kontinuum Garden comes complete with a high-efficiency LED system. We will also include a motor, pump, fan and everything else you need to fully assemble the garden.</p>
<h3>The Plan</h3>
<p>Our plan consists of four steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build a regular-sized 3D printer. COMPLETED</li>
<li>Use the regular-sized 3D printer to print the pieces for a large 1x1 meter 3D printer.</li>
<li>Design, print and assemble 3 Kontinuum Gardens.</li>
<li>Testing; food, different types of plants and growth-media, and release our data to the open-source community.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Why Make it Open Source?</h3>
<p>We believe that a combined effort yields a better product. The concept of Open Source allows others to become inspired, and make their own changes and upgrades. Undoubtedly someone will get an idea to make the garden more efficient, and in the long run, we will all benefit from it.</p>
<p>Also, we believe that these types of technical solutions should be freely accessible as a basic human right. Believing you can own an idea is an illusion. Your idea is built on the common knowledge of mankind, and the minute you share your idea with other people, they own it too.</p>
<p>When this project is completed we will set up a webshop and sell the Kontinuum Garden online. However, anyone will be able to find the designs and instruction for free online and build the printer and garden themselves from scratch.</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>If we reach our goal of $8,000, $2,000 will go to parts for the big printer (including motors, hotend, heatbed, structural metal, bearings, electronics etc.) and the other $6,000 will go to 3 fully functional Kontinuum Gardens (including plastic, motor, fan, LED system etc.)</p>
<p>If we fall short of the $8,000 goal, we will scale down the initial project and instead only print 1 or 2 gardens depending on the amount we do raise.</p>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>The campaign goal is to print 3 fully functional gardens. We intend to test the potential of one of them ourselves and send the other two out for testing under various circumstances. One will go to a retired agricultural engineer, and the other to a small family. This will provide us with important growth data as well as feedback about what works and what needs revision to make it user-friendly to as many people as possible.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Perks of course include our deepest gratitude but also supporter and sponsor titles, or how about your name forever engraved in the Kontinuum Garden prototype? You can also get your name printed on one of the growth boxes which will then be shipped to your home when we finish testing. You can even be the first person to own a Kontinuum Garden. Apart from the initial 3 gardens we intend to make, 2 additional gardens will be available as perks, complete with LED system, motor, pump etc. for you to put together yourself. We will of course make a free instructional video that you can view online.</p>

We are two brothers who live in Copenhagen, Denmark. One works as an animator and compositor and the other as a video director and editor. Even though we took a more artistic route than the rest of our engineer family, we have always had a love for constructing things: everything from Legos to video equipment such as dollytracks, skatedollys and glidecams. When we discovered 3D printing through the RepRap Project we realized that this technology would allow us to design things, and make a difference on a much bigger scale. We started to look for attainable goals, and for the last 6 months we have been working on our first project; the Kontinuum Garden.
What is a Rotating Garden?
The Kontinuum Garden is a hydroponic garden. It's a highly efficient rotating flood & drain system (see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroponics#Ebb_and_flow_or_flood_and_drain_sub-irrigation) that lets you grow fresh vegetables, fruits, herbs and even flowers in the comfort of your own home. It is easy to use, has minimal water consumption, produces high yields on a minimal area, and all without getting your hands dirty.
You can put them in your garage, home or perhaps a school. You could even get together with others in your community, designate an empty store, a building or an entire area to set up a place where everyone has free access to hydroponic food.
The Kontinuum Garden is our original design but of course we are familiar with the other designs that are on the market such as the Volksgarden, the RotoGro System, and the B-Pod etc. However, none of these gardens come with lights whereas the Kontinuum Garden comes complete with a high-efficiency LED system. We will also include a motor, pump, fan and everything else you need to fully assemble the garden.
The Plan
Our plan consists of four steps:

Build a regular-sized 3D printer. COMPLETED
Use the regular-sized 3D printer to print the pieces for a large 1x1 meter 3D printer.
Design, print and assemble 3 Kontinuum Gardens.
Testing; food, different types of plants and growth-media, and release our data to the open-source community.

Why Make it Open Source?
We believe that a combined effort yields a better product. The concept of Open Source allows others to become inspired, and make their own changes and upgrades. Undoubtedly someone will get an idea to make the garden more efficient, and in the long run, we will all benefit from it.
Also, we believe that these types of technical solutions should be freely accessible as a basic human right. Believing you can own an idea is an illusion. Your idea is built on the common knowledge of mankind, and the minute you share your idea with other people, they own it too.
When this project is completed we will set up a webshop and sell the Kontinuum Garden online. However, anyone will be able to find the designs and instruction for free online and build the printer and garden themselves from scratch.
What We Need
If we reach our goal of $8,000, $2,000 will go to parts for the big printer (including motors, hotend, heatbed, structural metal, bearings, electronics etc.) and the other $6,000 will go to 3 fully functional Kontinuum Gardens (including plastic, motor, fan, LED system etc.)
If we fall short of the $8,000 goal, we will scale down the initial project and instead only print 1 or 2 gardens depending on the amount we do raise.
The Goal
The campaign goal is to print 3 fully functional gardens. We intend to test the potential of one of them ourselves and send the other two out for testing under various circumstances. One will go to a retired agricultural engineer, and the other to a small family. This will provide us with important growth data as well as feedback about what works and what needs revision to make it user-friendly to as many people as possible.
What You Get
Perks of course include our deepest gratitude but also supporter and sponsor titles, or how about your name forever engraved in the Kontinuum Garden prototype? You can also get your name printed on one of the growth boxes which will then be shipped to your home when we finish testing. You can even be the first person to own a Kontinuum Garden. Apart from the initial 3 gardens we intend to make, 2 additional gardens will be available as perks, complete with LED system, motor, pump etc. for you to put together yourself. We will of course make a free instructional video that you can view online.

The Tapko Widow's Collective is a group of over 70 women living in the village of Tapko, in northwest Ghana, who are dedicated to creating sustainable and empowering solutions to poverty in their community. An entirely grassroots, village-organized group, they have identified specific needs and goals to continue their process toward self-sufficiency. In 2003 the collective began selling direct-trade Shea butter to supply Tapko with a sustainable source of income. Since then they have purchased health care and school supplies.

      The Widow's Collective is currently raising funds for three projects which, along with the Shea butter income, will provide them with increased economic and environmental stability:

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>For the past ten years, I have offered acupuncture, chinese medicine, and nutritional counseling to the good people of Los Angeles.  If you have had treatment from me, you know my passion for chinese medicine and its capacity to help people.  I have reached a point in my career where I want to own and operate my own office.  I just need seed money to purchase equipment and pay a few months' rent.  I have no doubt that the day I open my doors, I will have a steady stream of clientele, both new and former.  It's just the initial investment, that in the immediate, seems elusive.  That is why I am turning to all of you and humbly requesting support.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>I am going to open a small clinic that is more centrally-located so that I may serve more people. This will mean less driving for you westsiders. I will operate this clinic myself meaning more privacy for my current clientele.</div>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>When you donate to my endeavor, I will match your donation dollar for dollar in acupuncture sessions in my new clinic.  Here is what that means for you:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>A first session with me is $125.  So if you donate $125, you get an initial session which is an evaluation, acupuncture and email support.</p>
<p>A follow-up session with me is $80.  So if you donate $80 (or in increments of $80) you get a follow-up session(s) with email support.</p>
<p>A series of cosmetic acupuncture is $1,100 for ten sessions.  So if you donate $1,100, you get 10 sessions of cosmetic acupuncture and email support.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>So really, it's a win-win!  Obviously, you will need to live in Los Angeles to benefit in the dollar for dollar offer.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If you wish to donate $5, I will receive it with tremendous heartfelt thanks.  If you live in other parts of the world, I will not be able to honor the dollar for dollar offer but you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you created something really meaningful and beautiful in my life.  And for that, I extend my deepest gratitude.</p>

Over the course of 3 event-filled days, savvy, influential and talented women (and a few men!) bloggers will re-ignite a sense of unity within the multicultural blogging community. We'll also connect with marketers who recognize the importance of our demographic in todayâ€™s marketplace, all while networking, building relationships, and promoting inspiration and success for each other.** 
Helping me to reach this goal is giving my family & business a better chance at being the best it can be. And eventually not living lest than check to check.

<p>My name is Scott Schipper and I am a 27 year old musician from California's Northern Bay Area. In mid November of 2011 I was diagnosed with colon cancer of the colon and liver. I play in a national touring reggae band named ""Thrive"". I took a step back and realized how many people can be reached when your playing in front of 100's to 1,000's of people every night and over the internet. Inspired by my bandmates, family and friends I decided to start a movement to stop cancer named, ""Unify to Thrive"". Unify to Thrive is a non-profit organization that raises money for the children at St. Judes Hospital for Children. Me being so young and having a type of cancer that is usually only found in older men is the reason I decided to reach out to the children. The children in our society are the most important thing of all to me. Seeing a child suffer is the one thing that really chokes me up most since I have been battling cancer. Knowing that a 1 month year old child is in pain and not able to tell his/her parents. It is just tragic. No parent should ever see their child out live them in this day and age. Unify to Thrive is also a clothing line. That is how we have been raising money for the children thus far. At <a href=""http://www.unifytothrive.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.unifytothrive.com</a> you can order a full line of apparel and 100% of the profits go straight to the children at St. Judes. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I play in a musical scene where with all the bands combined there are over 2 million friends on facebook available at the click of a button. With that many people reached at the click of a button the chance for success is guaranteed! This campaign is geared to success only. Is only raising 2000$ when the goal is 5000$ a failure? Heck no! Every dollar counts in this campaign. Every dollar that helps a child is a dollar well spent. No if ands or buts.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am raising money to make Unify to Thrive be heard at an international level. When I say heard I dont just mean the name, I mean the music. Music heals and so do the repercussions of people coming together for a great cause. I am raising money to record, print and press a reggae album. This album will be comprised of some of the best, well known reggae artists and bands in America. Reggae bands and artists with hundreds of thousands of fans coming together to record on an an album that will have all its profits donated to St. Judes Hospital for Children. If I do not reach my goal I will not give up. I will continue to sell Unify To Thrive apparel and contribute all the profits to St. Judes Hospital for Children. I will keep going until I make this goal a reality.</p>

</h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong><em>Nicholas has a dream to be in the community workplace someday just like his big brothers and sister.</em></strong></p>
<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<h2><strong>Sadly, Nicholas' future is one of being isolated with little chance of escaping the dreariness of a sheltered workshop</strong></h2>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong><em>The Nicholas Project will  provide the skills, opportunity, and the environment to enable Nicholas, and hundreds of others also, to live their dreams out.</em></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Nicholas Project</strong> provides a real business for Nicholas, and other intellectually disabled individuals. This business, and eventually businesses,  will give these individuals real jobs in a real business and help them to learn life skills, feel true independence, and create lasting friendships within the community. Most programs for intellectually disabled people place them into isolation. The Nicholas Project includes them into society.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Nicholas Project - A Real Business for Intellectually Disabled Individuals</h3>
<p>There are a great many programs out there for training people who are disabled, but one group of disabled people are often overlooked. The intellectually disabled are often placed into workshops where they sit around tables with dozens of others and shred paper with their hands or stuff envelopes.  If they are lucky, they may be chosen to put together a simple product such as ceiling sprinklers designed for fire protection.  It is rare that any of these programs place the disabled trainees side by side with non-disabled peers. Because of that, socialization among the trainees is very poor and often leads to conflict. Not quite the life anyone dreams of achieving.</p>
<p>The saddest thing is that these people are often trained in school vocational programs that are very good and give the students a feeling of belonging and worth. Losing their place in those programs when they graduate can have a sudden and awful affect on the individuals and is often followed by a marked increase in depression. Parents often talk of how their children had such a love of life until they graduated and entered some of these sheltered workshops. I have had parents tell me that the change in their children was so significant that they felt helpless in trying to help them.  This program offers the help that many of these parents so badly need.</p>
<p>I have worked with intellectually disabled students for 31 years. I know they can do so much more than society thinks they can. I have seen it first hand with many students and now with my wonderful son Nicholas.  Intellectually disabled individuals can hold productive and meaningful jobs when given proper training.  Sure, some of these jobs are jobs the average non-disabled person would probably scoff at, such as stocking shelves, bussing tables, etc. but that is much more challenging and satisfying to them than simply shredding paper.  The great thing about getting these people in jobs like I am describing is that intellectually disabled individuals will almost always love their jobs and take great pride in them. They never complain about the job being boring, too hard, or really anything else that would be negative. You give an intellectually disabled person a job like these, <strong>train them right and </strong>you will have an employee for years. Turnover will not be an issue in a position that, in the past, has exceedingly high turnover among non-disabled employees. The best part is that these people will no longer be isolated, but will instead be a valued member of the workforce.</p>
<p>My son, Nicholas, has Down Syndrome and Autism. He is a good worker but will always need supports to work and be a productive member of society.  Most individuals with disabilities like Nic's end up, after graduation from high school, working in those shelters I described earlier.  They sit around all day and shred paper by hand, stuff envelopes, and receive little to no interaction with others.  It is no wonder that most of them are so lifeless when you visit these workshops. It hurts me deeply to see the students I had, who were full of life and seemed to have such a carefree life, become so detached from life and society when they enter these workshops after graduating from high school.</p>
<p>Nic is 15 years old and will be entering the school's vocational training program soon. It is important to him that he has a real job, a job that this project would create, during his vocational training program so that he can experience real work environments instead of sitting at a table tearing paper. That is why we, at The Nicholas Project, want to have the flagship part of the project up and running by Summer 2013. It can be used with more students, or graduates, who need training too. This real world training program, which will give the people working in it real wages, can provide individual skills to each trainee that can help level out the playing field for them.  It is also a great way to foster inclusion as non-disabled workers will need to work in the business so that the disabled people can better learn acceptable work skills.</p>
<p>We believe that people with intellectual disabilities can work in a small business such as a shaved ice business.  Nic loves to keep things organized and loves to clean also. These are jobs that he would be thrilled to have and would take great pride in. Many other cognitively disabled people would do well in this job too and will be given the same chance Nic gets.</p>
<p>We are hoping to gain the funding for one shaved ice trailer and entire business set-up such as the one from Frigid Frog, here in Texas.  After getting this one trailer up and running, I believe that the business will profit enough to purchase a second unit so that more disabled individuals will be able to enter the program and receive training and wages.  </p>
<p>Although the first business in this project will be a shaved ice business, other businesses created with profits could be a food truck, a small hamburger joint, a janitorial service, a pet service or kennel, etc.  The important aspect is that cognitively disabled individuals that would normally be ""warehoused"" into shelters will be trained for real world jobs.  They can stay in the business as long as it takes for them to find a job elsewhere.  They may even end up in the business they trained in permanently.</p>
<p><strong>After succeeding here in Lubbock, I hope to create a non-profit company helping people nationwide follow this model.</strong>  I will create a book, or manual, describing exactly how to do what we did and, with the profits created as well as sponsorship from people who will see just how amazing this project is, we will be able to provide seed money for those people to start a business too. I know this will work. It could help thousands of people but I need the funding for only the first trailer and business.</p>
<p><strong>Less than $20,000 can create a project that can help thousands and generate millions of dollars without government funding. All we need is the seed money to get this project started. Once I prove that these individuals can be given lives that are meaningful, the profits and the private sponsorships will provide the funding for so many others.</strong>  </p>
<h3>What We Need and Why</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>As you can see in the link below,  the trailer , shaved ice machine, and the flavor package costs $16,790. After the fees, the total funded amount is a little less than what is needed, but I will come up with that amount locally. </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.thefrigidfrog.com/photos.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">You can see what is provided by Frigid Frog in this link</a>. </p>
<p>We hope to get this trailer up and running by Spring 2013 and save the profits from all of our hard-work and buy a second trailer and a third and so on.  Shaved Ice businesses are very profitable as the entire cost of making a sno-cone is about 35 or 40 cents and sell for up to $3 or $4.  Many weekend events such as parades or fairs can create a huge profit trail while putting our hard-working individuals to work, which will enable pride and joy in their work.  I know my son will thrive.</p>
<p>I have been a special education teacher for 31 years and have professionally worked with disabled individuals long before Nicholas entered my life.  Having him changed my life for the better.  I see how talented he is but it is not easy for others to see these special abilities, how much joy he receives from working and from pleasing others when he does good work.  I have job-coached disabled students and know that the opportunities are not readily available in our communities.  This project will start out small and grow into a huge national program that can be copied in every community across the country.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This small trailer can create hundreds of copy-cat businesses for other individuals who have disabilities and who can work productively when given the opportunity instead of being pushed aside and forgotten.</p>
<p>Many parents of a child like mine will tell you that they dread the day their child graduates from high school because the options for a real job are extremely slim. This project can grow to being something that puts hope out there for others.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>A Bonus for You</h3>
<p>There are a couple of perks for you when you graciously fund The Nicholas Project. The perks are listed on the right side of this page. Talented Creative Design Team Leader Brandon Bussell has created an awesome and very recognizable shirt for all those people who choose that perk. I will also send you a newsletter keeping you abreast of how this whole project grows so that you can see what a huge difference you helped make.</p>

<p>The Anywhere Alarm is a great invention that will change how people protect themselves, their families and their property. The Anywhere Alarm is an inexpensive, small, portable, simple to use alarm system that gives everybody a little more comfort and security.</p>

<p>If the Anywhere Alarm prevents one act of violence in a hotel or motel, prevents one child from consuming liquor, poisons or paint, prevents one teen from playing with Dad’s power tools or guns, it will all be worth it.</p>
<p>The Anywhere Alarm is armed by removing the unique electronic key. It will then sound the alert siren (100dB) if moved in any direction. It can be used to protect against entry from the outside: on doors, windows, gates, etc. The Anywhere Alarm also keeps people out of unauthorized inside places: medicine cabinets, under the kitchen sink, paint lockers, gun cabinets, private papers, closets, power tools, etc. Or, less critically, it can be used to keep little brother out of little sister’s room, and vice versa.</p>

<p>The Anywhere Alarm Intruder Alert System is easy to use because all the thinking is done by an on board computer. Many security devices wind up too complicated.

With the Anywhere Alarm, there are no switches, no settings. Just pull out the unique key, place it where you want it and it will arm itself.</p>

<p>The Anywhere Alarm was designed to be small, lightweight and easy to carry with you. More than 70% of American overseas travelers are women. When they are staying in hotels abroad, they can be targets for violence or theft. The Anywhere Alarm protects anyone who travels. It needs no external power. No transformers. No strange plugs. The built in battery will last for at least 3 years. It can give you that extra measure of protection against theft or violence.</p>
<p>The Anywhere Alarm is moving forward. The funds being raised are for manufacturing units and to produce a series of commercials to be aired nationally.</p>

<p><strong>What is Sugartooth Tours?</strong></p>
<p>Sugartooth Tours is a new dessert tasting tour launching in the late fall of 2012 in Manhattan. On our food tours, our licensed NYC tour guides take a group through a neighborhood giving historical and a culinary background to the city and specific neighborhoods while tasting some of the best local sweets.</p>
<p>Our tours are special because we are dedicated to serving the sweet-tooth in everyone! We seek to provide the best customer experience through high quality tastings, superior customer service, and friendly and informed tour guides.</p>
<p><strong>Meet the Owners:</strong></p>
<p>Co-owners Allyson Tolbert and Sarah Rolleston come from a theatrical background. After getting their degrees at the University of Florida and Ithaca College (respectively) they both performed in multiple national Broadway tours. One could say that they ate their way across the United States and Canada while touring with the shows, searching out the best local foods in each city, and often going on food tours. Now back in New York City, they have decided to share their love of food, specifically the sweet stuff, with the rest of the world. </p>
<p><strong>About Culinary Tourism:</strong></p>
<p>Culinary tourism is defined as experiencing the food of a country, region, or area, and is quickly becoming one of the most popular ways to explore a city. Not only is tourism in New York City on the rise, but culinary tourism is on the rise all across the United States and the entire world. One of the great aspects of culinary tourism is that it appeals not only to tourists, but also to locals. The rise of the foodie-culture in New York City makes this especially true in our great city. </p>
<p><strong>How You Can Help</strong>:</p>
<p>We are seeking to raise $4000. With this money we can:</p>
<ul>
<li>become a legal entity</li>
<li>launch our website</li>
<li>become licensed NYC tour guides</li>
<li>purchase promotional materials</li>
<li>pay for our first year of insurance costs</li>
<li>cover other miscellaneous costs such as office supplies. </li>
</ul>
<p>We have great incentives at a variety of donation levels and you can see them all on the right side of this page. </p>
<p>We hope that you are as excited and passionate about our business as we are, and we hope that you will help us get Sugartooth Tours get off the ground by making a donation today. Donations of even $1 are helpful. Even if you are unable to donate, you can help us by spreading the word and passing along our information.

Who We Are
And What We're Doing
 
My name is
Nick Phillips and Iâ€™m bringing downtown Denver itâ€™s newest source for luxury
transportation. Carrying somewhere between 8-12 passengers, the People Powered
Limo is the best way for downtown Denver guests to get from the bar to bar. The
People Powered Limo is designed to be a hybrid between people power and a low
speed electric vehicle.
 
The People
Powered Limo turns Denver into the ultimate party zone. With the hottest bars
and clubs on a 7 block stretch the People Powered Limo gives downtown a safe
and exciting way to see all that these places have to offer. This seven block
stretch is the Bar Route. It spans from 14th and Market to 21st
and Market and hits areas on Blake and Larimer including Larimer Square and
Beta Music Hall. 
                        One Time Rides = $5
                        All Night Pass + Perks = $20
 
The People Powered Limo is
also the best source for your next big advertising campaign!

Why
Do We Need Only $15,000?
 
The People
Powered Limo needs the funding to exist. Weâ€™re working together with Orlando
Baker and his team in Fort Collins to make my innovation a reality. $15,000 was the
number put together from the necessary materials to build the first one. These
include:
                        
Steel
Alloy for the Frame â€“ $2,500
                        Recumbent Bike Parts â€“ $2,000  
                        Limo Seating Area â€“ $5,000
                        Lights (Interior and Exterior) â€“ $1,000
                        Wheels â€“ $1,000
                        Electric Assists â€“ $1,500
                        Gearing â€“ $500                        
                        Storage Area â€“ $750
                        Website, Business Cards, Marketing â€“ $750
            
We're already in the drafting stage now and with our goal reached we can have this service out by Mid April! If we blow
our goal out of the water, we will build more People Powered Limos and continue
to make the service even better. 
                        
The Impact
 
If you
know me then the biggest impact you will be making is on me. Iâ€™ve been dreaming
about this sense I was a pedicab manager for Jayâ€™s Valet and rather than going
to investors Iâ€™m trying to make this happen with the help of friends and
family. Iâ€™m going all out on this one and canâ€™t wait to make this happen.
If you
donâ€™t know me then the biggest important impact your going to make is for
yourself. Whenever you come downtown you can always guarantee that when that
People Powered Limo is out on the Bar Route you donâ€™t have to stress about
getting from bar to bar or back to your car or light rail. Weâ€™ll have you
covered!
 
What
You Get for Your Help!
 
Beyond
being a huge part of bringing my People Powered Limo idea to life and getting
to enjoy the service, contributors also get the awesome Perks listed to the
right.
Our
Perks are mostly service based and will come when the People Powered Limo is
up and running this summer. We will also be doing drawings based on your
donation amounts. There will be a $5 drawing, a $30 drawing and a $100 drawing.
More to come on those later! 
If you
have any ideas for rewards Iâ€™m very good at listening to suggestions! Already thinking
about doing some advertising Perks
 
VERY IMPORTANT!! 
You donâ€™t
have to give monetarily to make an impact, we need all the noise we can get
using Facebook, Twitter, Word of Mouth and any other technique you use!
Also as
stated before I want to do some drawings. There will be movies, People Powered
Limo Gear, cool Rockies gear and whatever else we can get our hands on! If you have a local business or a product you want to get out there drop me an email at thepeoplepoweredlimo@gmail.com and we'll work something out!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p></p>
<p>First, please check back as more photos and video will be added.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I am the owner of Rolling Hills Asylum in E. Bethany, NY, a 54,000 sq. ft. and 11 &amp; 1/2 acre historical property in Western NY.  Opened January 1, 1827 as the Genesee County Poor Farm, the property has a rich history and has had many lives, including becoming the Genesee County Infirmary and the Genesee County Nursing Home, before closing in 1974. It sat empty for nearly 10 years, eventually having a succession of private owners spanning over the last 38 years - making me the fourth private owner.  Rolling Hills Asylum is a pseudonym created by the morphing of names created for the property by a few of the previous owners.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The property has a history steeped in sadness and tragedy, including over 1700 documented deaths.  From the early 1700's when it was a stage coach stop and a tavern, to when it opened on January 1, 1827 as The Genesee County Poor Farm, a self sustaining facility consisting of over 200 acres of land, fruit and vegetable gardens, cattle, chickens, various crops, a bakery and dairy, and more.  People would come to reside here because of poverty, such as losing their farms, becoming a widow, widower, or an orphan, perhaps they were a civil war veteran, or be mentally or physically disabled. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The next phase of the property was created in 1938 and was opened as the Genesee County Infirmary,  the hospital for  county. It handled all types of illnesses including tuberculosis.  By the mid-sixties another transformation was made when it became the Genesee County Nursing Home.  It stayed open until 1974 when a new facility was built in Batavia, NY and the residents were relocated, causing the facility to shut down. Over the next few years the property was divided (all but 11 acres became the Genesee County Park) and many of the old wooden structures such as the dorms and barns were torn down, leaving the main brick buildings and just a few smaller barns and a carriage house.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>in mid 2009 I heard the then owners were giving up the property and no one knew what would happen to the facility.  Thats when an overwhelming desire to acquire the property took hold of me, I was literally compelled to ""rescue"" the property, though my funds were menial,  in hopes of preserving the history and remembering all of the thousands of residents that have lived and died here.  Now that I  am here, I realize what a huge undertaking this project is, and though I have many amazing volunteers, money is still a major hold back in making the necessary repairs such as repairing the slate roofs, the flat tar roofs, re-grouting the old original windows, repairing the cupola, and sealing all the brick to thwart water damage.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>Last year, my volunteers helped remove close to 7 tons of pure garbage and this year the volunteers helped remove two 40 foot dumpsters of more pure garbage as well as begin the very necessary repairs of the holes in the roofs. As you can imagine, water is my enemy - that includes snow as well as rain.<br/><br/>My goal is to preserve the property and repair it so I may continue to expand on the historical tours and grow the museum, eventually expanding the repairs to the out buildings and grounds.  Poor Farms are an integral part of the history of the United States, they were almost like the first welfare system, if you will, and there are not very many of us still standing.  Poor Farms afforded a place for people to live safely, and as long as they were able-bodied, everyone had a job on the farm. This was to help keep the costs of the supporting the residents low, but also to give these people a sense of self worth, by helping to earn their keep, rather than just becoming some charity case. Though I embrace change, growth, advancement of technology, etc., its important to remember the past and recognize and pay homage to how life was so we can truly understand and count our blessings for todays gifts by keeping the history alive and available for others to come and experience.<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>For those donating $10 - $99 dollars, your name will go on the Rolling Hills Asylum website acknowledging your donations. For those donating  $101 to $999, your name will be included on the website as well as on a plaque to be hung in the museum in the building, thanking and acknowledging you for your donation.   Those contributing $1000 or more will receive both the afore mentioned as well as be invited out to a special RHA/ Indie GoGo thank you event later in 2012.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Currently Rolling Hills Asylum is supported by offering (for a fee) Historical and Flashlight tours as well as public and private ghost hunting opportunities, and by the generosity of volunteers who give of their time, sweat equity, and love and support of Rolling Hills Asylum, its former residents, and of me.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: bold;"">Other Ways You Can Help</span></p>
</div><div>
<p>Not everyone can spare the funds to donate, and I understand that.  However, if you smoke, buy a Starbucks, like to grab a glass of wine or a beer out, or even purchase chewing gum, would you please consider forgoing just one of your treats to help preserve this amazing property?  If not, you can help in other ways, the easiest is by spreading the word about the fund raising efforts of Rolling Hills Asylum here on Indie GoGo and of the tours offered at Rolling Hills Asylum by visiting our website at <a href=""http://www.RollingHillsAsylum.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.RollingHillsAsylum.com</a></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In the past, I've worked for The United Way and March of Dimes and one of the most important things I learned from these experiences is that if you never ask, you'll never receive a YES.  So please, don't assume your friends, colleagues, business associates, and acquaintances are not interested in helping preserve this incredible historical property. Don't answer NO for them. Instead, send them the link <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(232, 37, 95); font-family: Verdana;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><a href=""http://igg.me/p/56948?a=356555"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://igg.me/p/56948?a=356555</a></span></span> to this cause and let them make the decision for themselves. </p>

<p>...it exploded. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Suddenly, hundreds of thousands of people all around the world began to spread the word â€” They told me again and again that they desperately needed this quiet place.</p>
<p>I was (and still am) amazed. actually, it's ironic how much noise the quiet place is making :)</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>

<p>     Corsino Cakes has been around now for three years starting when owner Derek Corsino was still completing his degree in Baking and Pastry Management from The Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, NY.  Shortly after graduation, bakery space was secured and production began out of Red Hook shortly after.  After two and a half years it was time to move onto bigger and better things!</p>
<p>     In the winter of 2010-2011 Owner Derek Corsino competed in two Food Network Challenges, the first airing in August 2011: Renaissance Festival Cakes, and the next airing just a short time ago in October titled Halloween Ghost Story Cakes.  The responses from the show were fantastic, just ill timed as the relocation was not quite ready yet!  Corsino Cakes hopes to go back again to seek top prize and come home victorious next season.  <br/></p>
<p>     Once the shop gets fully off the ground the business will be expanding into new territory!  We will be offering classes in cake decorating starting with the basics and going up to advanced sculpture as well as a variety of classes in baking at home as well.  The business also will be expanding into some small scale wholesale cakes and pastries for local businesses, and finally selling small cakes and select bakery items from our new store in Wappingers.<br/></p>

</h2><p>Hi! My name is Brenda Braxton and I'm so proud to have been able to supply a much needed service by launching BBRAXTON; Exceptional Grooming for Exceptional Men, a men’s grooming salon in New York City. The salon is the first of its kind and occupies 2,000 sq. ft. of storefront in one of the city’s first “green” luxury high rise condominiums. The salon complements this evolution by providing the atmosphere of a traditional gentlemen's club, barber shop and new age spa; offering services such as hot towel straight razor shave, hair cuts and hair styling, body massage and integrated skin care. Patrons can catch up on the news, style trends, watch sports or relax and listen to R&amp;B or Jazz music streams. </p><h3>What We Need </h3><p>While launching BBRAXTON in 2006 was an amazing undertaking it was also a personal financial drain. At that time bank financing for this new venture was impossible. The lending institutions could not wrap their heads around the concept of an upscale barber shop.

But the economy has taken a toll on everyone and Small Businesess have felt it in a big way! Until now BBRAXTON has been able to survive through shear persistence and continually providing excellent custom service.

<p>Hello, I am Bobby Hill; CEO of a new, developing, entertainment company in Mobile, AL called BCHILL Entertainment. Yes, I said Alabama. I graduated with my A.S. Degree in Theater and my BFA in Theater Performance. In college, I never was really given a chance to act in many plays because of my skin color. I auditioned at other theaters and got parts in plays, films, commercials and more. I started to think to myself, I would never want my friends or family to go through that much hardship trying to get in a play because of skin color or different walks of life. That day I decided that I wanted to make a company for people that just need a break and a foot in the door for the love of the Arts.</p>
<p><strong>The Dream</strong></p>

<p>So BCHILL </p></div>","Short Summary
Hello, I am Bobby Hill; CEO of a new, developing, entertainment company in Mobile, AL called BCHILL Entertainment. Yes, I said Alabama. I graduated with my A.S. Degree in Theater and my BFA in Theater Performance. In college, I never was really given a chance to act in many plays because of my skin color. I auditioned at other theaters and got parts in plays, films, commercials and more. I started to think to myself, I would never want my friends or family to go through that much hardship trying to get in a play because of skin color or different walks of life. That day I decided that I wanted to make a company for people that just need a break and a foot in the door for the love of the Arts.

<p><strong>THE VINYASA FOR YOUTH PROGRAM</strong></p>
<p><em>Vinyasa Yoga for Youth</em> empowers youth aged 5-22 through the practice of Yoga. While the popularity of yoga continues to grow and classes and studios are readily available, programs geared specifically towards youth are hard to find, even in the major cities.  In the past 4 years, <em>Vinyasa Yoga for Youth</em> has established programs in 30 schools in Saskatchewan and has worked with over 2000 youth.  With the success of these programs, we are now ready to expand into additional cities across Canada</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>SUPPORTING YOUTH</strong></p>
<p>Yoga provides youth with an opportunity to be physically active in a non-judgmental, non-competitive environment. Youth learn to treat themselves with love and respect, and recognise that they have the power to make positive and healthy life choices. </p>
<p>In addition, yoga is proven to: Maintain flexibility and strength for growing bodies, enhance concentration, increase self-esteem, provide tools for stress management, spark creativity, enhance body awareness, teach discipline and responsibility and develop compassion for self and others.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>EXPANDING THE PROGRAM</strong></p>
<p>With internationally renowned yogi Ryan Leier serving as founder and directing chair of the program, <em>Vinyasa Yoga for Youth</em> has gained remarkable support. We are now looking to expand our reach into cities across Canada including: Vancouver, Halifax and Edmonton.  Funds raised will go directly toward:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.      Developing yoga youth training curriculums for school and community centre programs</p>
<p>2.      Connecting with school boards and communities</p>
<p>3.      Implementing programs</p>
<p>4.      Establishing sustainable grants to secure funding for our programming </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHO WE ARE</strong></p>
<p>Yoga for Youth is a registered non-profit in Saskatchewan (charitable status pending). Our program is currently running in Saskatoon Public and Catholic School Boards, the Northern Lights School District and in the beginning stages with the Greater Vancouver School District.  </p>
<p>The program supplements curriculum in primary and secondary schools by providing in-school workshops, supporting afterschool programs and youth groups, and holding weekend and summer retreats. We work with specific grants and business to support schools that have high numbers of At-Risk Youth (especially in inner-city locations) and have also just launched a pilot project in Northern Saskatchewan to the communities of Buffalo Narrows and La Loche.  </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Carole Freeman, a nutritionist and hypnotherapist. I have been passionate about helping people develop healthy eating habits for over 15 years. I'm a double graduate of Bastyr University with a bachelors in nutrition and a dual masters in nutrition and clinical health psychology. Additionally, I'm certified in clinical hypnotherapy.</p>
<p>My approach is different. I address the underlying issues that cause poor eating habits - correcting nutrient difficiencies, rebalancing brain chemistry, healing childhood issues, all while building self-esteem and teaching coping skills like mindful eating, emotional regulation and relaxation.</p>
<p>Some of you may know that my ultimate vision and goal is to develop the ""natural health version of Jenny Craig"" - natural health nutrition clinics throughout the Seattle area and expand into other states. While there are many diet clinics, there are currently NO NATURAL HEALTH weight loss clinics that offer a comprehensive solution to developing healthy eating habits that support long-term natural weight loss. There is a huge potential here!</p>
<p>Up to this point, I've been building my business, Hypnotic Nutrition, by ""bootstrapping"" - which means financing expantion via current cash flow. I have been seeing clients at two different locations, renting space from wellness centers in Kirkland and Bothell. I have found a 420 square foot location that will allow me to provide this revolutionary healthy lifestyle support all in one location in Bothell, WA (Seattle suburb). </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your donation will help me open my first clinic. Planned opening will be June 1, 2013. My goal is to raise $5,000 which will provide the supplies, equipment and improvements to the space so that Hypnotic Nutrition will have a full-time, dedicated location for serving clients. Funding this will allow me to provide 1-1 nutrition and hypnotherapy, cooking classes, nutrition and psychology workshops, healthy meals and snacks to-go, plus classes and workshop on a variety of topics to support healthy eating habits and a healthy lifestyle, like yoga, pilates, meditation, etc.</p>
<p>You get perks at each level of donation! (See below for more details of perks) You also will be helping bring a healthy, natural, effective, feel-good solution to many Americans that struggle with weight loss, self-esteem and healthy eating habits.</p>
<p>This is a bare-bones approach, but if my funding goal is not met completely, I will scale back even more. Donations will go towards funding start-up of clinic based on prioritization. My goal is to open this clinic, one way or another! </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Chances are, you know a friend or family member that has diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, depression or anxiety or is overweight or obese and at significant risk of developing serious illnesses due to poor eating habits and lifestyle.</p>
<p>Hypnotic Nutrition's clinic will have a huge impact on our community, both locally and beyond. Obesity is an epidemic with nearly 70% of American's being overweight or obese. Type 2 diabetes is increasing at record numbers. Children are gaining weight at alarming rates and developing diabetes at earlier and ealier ages. Depression and anxiety rates are on the rise, as well. Heart disease and cancer rates are growing, too. All of this can be greatly reduced by developing healthier eating habits. </p>
<p>Over the last 8 months, I have built my practice to 3 days per week of seeing clients, plus 2 ongoing groups. Opening this clinic will allow me to take it to the next level. Together we can help even more people lead the healthiest lives they can. Let's do this!</p>

What We Do 

We empower mom and women
entrepreneurs with a crowdfunding platform and innovative ecosystem that
provides financial guidance and long term funding.  We work with entrepreneurs to provide donors
and investors with quality, vetted opportunities. 
The
ecosystem also provides entrepreneurs with the ability to reach out to the
“crowd” (i.e., donors and supporters) for product evaluation and market needs.
By successfully engaging the crowd, entrepreneurs can acquire consumer and
product info that provides a
winning marketing edge. The Ecosystem also enables donors and investors to
“spot” good products and gain insight into the company’s capabilities and month to
month activities.
Why We Are Building a Crowdfunding Ecosystem for Mom and Women, Exclusively
Here’s why...
1. 
Woman

Startups' Crowdfunding Coach (and a mom), “We traditionally purchase over 85%
of all household products, plus we now dominate social networking and consumer technology
usage. Most of us have generated ideas for new products or how to improve
existing ones. We need to turn our innovative ideas into reality.”
2. 
Women
Startups are lagging for they can get the most important ingredient - MONEY


Despite all the news, woman startups are
lagging behind their male counterparts (Kauffman Foundation study,A Rising Tide).

Why? For every $100 of investment capital
committed, women entrepreneurs receive only $5. (Alicia Robb, author - A Rising)

The reason?  Alicia Robb notes…Men
start with more money, enabling easier debt financing.  Old-boys
investment community has few women members.

</h3>
</div>
</div>
<h3>How can you do what no one else can?</h3>
<p>Let's take the emotion and passion out of the equation for a second.  It boils down to aggregating planes in an efficient manner, and putting like-minded people in the same private jet going to the same destination who are willing to work with our rules.  We also have some pretty smart Flight Planners!<br/></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b>How many jets do you own?</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Not One! That is another reason why Jumpjet can do what others can't because we buy large amounts of charter from the industry. We are a friend to the industry and we don't have the headaches and costs of owning the jets like the airlines do.</p>
<h3>Have you Tested this yet?</h3>
<p>YES, we did a Beta test last summer.  We flew approximately 900 hours.  We made some mistakes and did some learning.  One of the reasons we are doing this crowd funding is to upgrade our technology, and to implement our new systems. We also have learned in the months since then that a lot of people would like to use the service.</p>

<p></p>
<h3>What countries will Jumpjet be flying in the future?</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>USA is our first market (except Alaska and Hawaii), and we are open for membership in 42 USA ""origination"" cities with another 78 cities planned over the next two years.  You can fly from any ""origination"" city to any other city of your choice within the 48 contiguous states. From there we will expand into Canada, The Caribbean and Mexico, South America, Europe, Asia , UAE and India. </p>
<h3>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Why set such a low funding goal?</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>It’s all about scale. To offer the final product at a competitive price we need to produce enough volume to make an impact. We believe this funding target and these perk levels give us the best chance of success. Mind you if we can exceed our goal we would not complain.</p>
<h3>What if you fail to reach the funding target?</h3>
<p>Well, we are not focusing on the negatives.  We believe there are enough of you out there who would like to fly on a private jet and make a difference while doing so. Let's see what we can all achieve.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Can I come work for you?</h3>Come on down. We need a few great people to help. If you want to volunteer and earn some free flights you can do that from your home.  If you'd like to come join the team send us a letter about yourself and the difference you can make each day at Jumpjet.</div>

<h3>If I live overseas but travel to the USA can I still use Jumpjet?</h3>Yes.  You must be screened against the USA ""NO FLY LIST"", which we will do for you.  As long as you are approved, then may we offer you a cup of coffee and a danish before take off.</div>
<div><span style=""line-height: 30px;""><b><h3>Regarding time zones and pricing?</h3></b></span></div>

</div></div>","Join the Jumpjet Set. We have hacked the world of private flying, and are passing on the savings to you. We offer round trips in a private jet for commercial airline prices.Our proprietary technology optimizes charter schedules to offer round trip flights to members as low as $450 within their time zone, and $1750 coast-to-coast. Memberships start at $21 per year to allow you access to our services as needed, and monthly Premier memberships offer guaranteed rates and tons of benefits. Founded by an expert in the aviation industry, we launched our beta test last year to test the concept. It went really well, and we are ready to start flying, we just need your help. To be able to process thousands of reservations on a national scale and handle customer experiences we need to upgrade our technology. This includes producing an enterprise APP as well as back-end technology that syncs with car and hotel rentals.Imagine flying like this:

When you paid for this: 




No lines, free bags, and fly with other cool JumpJetters.  
WHAT IS JUMPJET?

Jumpjet is a tech-oriented company, and the only company in the world offering private jet travel at commercial airline prices.
We use long term planning and shared travel to offer low prices:
-Plan your trip at least 30 days out. The further out you book, the cheaper it gets.
-Be flexible when booking, but final dates are confirmed within 24 hours of booking.

Jumpjet is great for companies of all sizes, alumni trips, sport trips, wedding trips, gifts, anniversaries, bat/barmitzvahs, mile high club, celebrities and non-celebrities, families with kids and families without kids, couples of all shapes and sizes, and even your cat or dog!

They don’t want to see it close.A Community SolutionThis month, when we heard that the locally owned, independent Bookshelf in Truckee, was about to close after 20 years, we formed a group to breathe some new life into the business and try to save it.The Bookshelf has been such an important part of our lives as readers, parents, teachers, community members, writers, and isolated mountain dwellers -- not only for the books, but also for the author and community events that the Bookshelf has hosted over the years. We can’t imagine Truckee without it. Here's Our Plan to Save Our Shelf:• Buy Books: We have launched a grassroots campaign to raise awareness about the fate of Bookshelf to encourage community to buy local, especially during the holiday season;• Youth-Led Rally on November 23rd: High school students designed and implemented a campaign to raise awareness via social media and culminating with a rally on November 23rd. Check out their campaign at www.gofundme.com/5636jk;• Raise Money: We have launched this campaign to raise $30,000 over the next 60 days from the community and long-time patrons. Our hope is that thousands will donate a small amount to help Save Our Shelf;• Improve the Space: We plan to bring in a local interior design expert (who has generously donated her service) to give the old Shelf a new, more inviting and appealing look (with the possibility of new paint, furniture, window displays, etc.);• Create new business plan for long-term sustainability: We are collecting ideas on how to transform the Bookshelf including a membership model, new ownership, forming partnerships, or finding a new space. In January we will analyze our options and move forward. Our Goal:Develop a Bookshelf that is everything we love about the old Shelf and more -- with a sustainable business plan that can become a model for other efforts like ours to keep culture, the arts, and small businesses alive and well.All we need is you.The ImpactThis campaign and the funds that we raise here will determine the future of the Shelf! Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can't make a donation to the campaign, you can still help the Save Our Shelf campaign succeed by contributing in other ways. We would love it if you:• Spread the word! Please forward this campaign on to all friends, colleagues, and family• Join the working group. We need more people with resources, expertise, and most importantly, energy and time to help out in making this happen. If you can volunteer some time we would love for you to get involved. Stop by the Bookshelf or e-mail the owner, Debbie Lane (bookshelf.truckee@yahoo.com), to learn how.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>In 2011 at the age of 46, I was diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer. I had no family history, ate well, exercised, didn't smoke and rarely drank. As I went through treatment, I met many women who were in my same position. In fact many refer to Breast Cancer as an epidemic. If this is true, something has changed in our lives that is causing this. I began looking at the products I put on my skin and was shocked to learn that many of the products that were ""natural"" also had parabins, chemicals and dyes. I decided to go back to basics and design my own skin care made from all natural ingredients and essential oils. From this, the idea to create a ""chemo care"" package for women going through treatment came to me. Women's skin, nails and sense of smell change dramatically when going through chemo. This package will include a calming body butter, foot balm, lip balm, facial toner and calming bath soap. All natural, UNscented and with your help, free to the women who are in need of these products. I will use the funds raised here specifically for the chemo care.

<b>
</b><p><span>We see horrifying images of violence coming from the Middle East these past
weeks, and a seemingly unending cycle of hatred and conflict – with both sides
stuck in a narrative with no way out.  We are a group of former combatants that
are not waiting for our governments - we are actively doing it differently, and we need your help.</span></p>
<p>The
“Combatants for Peace” movement was started jointly by Palestinians and
Israelis who have taken an active part in the cycle of violence; Israelis as
soldiers in the Israeli army (IDF) and Palestinians as part of the violent
struggle for Palestinian freedom. After brandishing weapons for so many years,
and having seen one another only through weapon sights, we have decided to lay down our arms, and to fight for peace.  Our mission is to actively spread the message that a non-violent solution to the conflict is possible, and our hundreds of members and participants are living proof that it is.</p>
<p><b>We
Need Your Support to Continue These Important Activities - especially now with
the ongoing violence between our countries.  Help Us Reach A Wider
Audience With Our Message</b><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">.</b></p>
<p>Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent in just the last month on this war. And the media only perpetuates it by focusing solely on stories and images of violence and hate.  We take a different path.</p>
<p><b>Your funding will help us to:</b></p>
<p>· Hire and set
up Bi-National media teams, which will work to get our story out and to act in order to influence public opinion
in Israel, Palestine and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>·
Bring consciousness to both publics regarding the hopes and suffering of
the other side, and to create partners in dialogue.</p>
<p>·
Educate towards reconciliation and non-violent struggle in both the Israeli and
Palestinian societies.</p>
<p>·
Create political pressure on both Governments to stop the cycle of violence,
end the occupation and resume a constructive dialog.</p><p>· Reach beyond the region and connect with people around the world who believe in non-violence and the importance of allowing a new story to emerge - one of peace, coexistence and interconnectedness.<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span><b>WE
BELIEVE </b></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">that
only by joining forces, will we be able to end the cycle of violence, the
bloodshed and the occupation and oppression of the Palestinian people while allowing for the ongoing security of the citizens of Israel. We understand that it is
impossible to resolve the conflict between the two peoples through violent
means; therefore we declare that we refuse to take part any more in the mutual
bloodletting. We will act only by non-violent means so that each side will come
to understand the national aspirations of the other side. We see dialogue and
reconciliation as the only way to act in order to terminate the Israeli
occupation, to halt the settlement project and to establish a Palestinian state
with its capital in East Jerusalem, alongside the State of Israel.</span></p>

Yet, it is already happening.Please support COMBATANTS FOR PEACE and their Media Outreach
Campaign and Bi-National Activities.[Please Note: Thanks to iWagePeace, donations are currently being matched dollar for dollar up to a total of $7,500!! See Our Latest Update.]





We see horrifying images of violence coming from the Middle East these past
weeks, and a seemingly unending cycle of hatred and conflict – with both sides
stuck in a narrative with no way out.  We are a group of former combatants that
are not waiting for our governments - we are actively doing it differently, and we need your help.
The
“Combatants for Peace” movement was started jointly by Palestinians and
Israelis who have taken an active part in the cycle of violence; Israelis as
soldiers in the Israeli army (IDF) and Palestinians as part of the violent
struggle for Palestinian freedom. After brandishing weapons for so many years,
and having seen one another only through weapon sights, we have decided to lay down our arms, and to fight for peace.  Our mission is to actively spread the message that a non-violent solution to the conflict is possible, and our hundreds of members and participants are living proof that it is.
We
Need Your Support to Continue These Important Activities - especially now with
the ongoing violence between our countries.  Help Us Reach A Wider
Audience With Our Message.
Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent in just the last month on this war. And the media only perpetuates it by focusing solely on stories and images of violence and hate.  We take a different path.
Your funding will help us to:
· Hire and set
up Bi-National media teams, which will work to get our story out and to act in order to influence public opinion
in Israel, Palestine and the rest of the world.
·
Bring consciousness to both publics regarding the hopes and suffering of
the other side, and to create partners in dialogue.
·
Educate towards reconciliation and non-violent struggle in both the Israeli and
Palestinian societies.
·
Create political pressure on both Governments to stop the cycle of violence,
end the occupation and resume a constructive dialog.· Reach beyond the region and connect with people around the world who believe in non-violence and the importance of allowing a new story to emerge - one of peace, coexistence and interconnectedness.


WE
BELIEVE that
only by joining forces, will we be able to end the cycle of violence, the
bloodshed and the occupation and oppression of the Palestinian people while allowing for the ongoing security of the citizens of Israel. We understand that it is
impossible to resolve the conflict between the two peoples through violent
means; therefore we declare that we refuse to take part any more in the mutual
bloodletting. We will act only by non-violent means so that each side will come
to understand the national aspirations of the other side. We see dialogue and
reconciliation as the only way to act in order to terminate the Israeli
occupation, to halt the settlement project and to establish a Palestinian state
with its capital in East Jerusalem, alongside the State of Israel.


WE ARE A COMMITTED GROUP that began in  2005 with a few people, and now number in the hundreds, with 5 regional groups.  We have been organizing meetings between Israeli and
Palestinian veterans, in which both sides tell about the violent actions that
they have taken part in and about the turning point which led them to
understand the limits of violence. Naturally, these meetings were fraught with
many fears, however we soon learned that despite years of fear and hatred,
there is more that unites us than divides.  Even in these
most trying of times, we are determined to:
· Continue with the combatants’
meetings, which allow each side to understand the other’s narrative, via the
approach of reconciliation rather than conflict.
· Implement an educational lecture
series in public forums on both sides (universities, youth groups, schools
etc.). The lectures will be given jointly by an Israeli and a Palestinian
veteran, who will concentrate on the transition from violent struggle to the recognition
of the limits of violence.
· Create joint projects which educate
towards non- violence.
· Create joint frameworks in order to
become familiar with the culture, history and current needs of the other
nation.
· Participate in demonstrations and
other non-violent actions against the occupation as a bi-national group.
WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT to break this cycle of hatred and conflict and to end this conflict through non-violent means.

eating a traditional, Mexican-American Cuisine consisting of beef, pork, and
dairy. After years of being ill from food-related ingredients, Rey had the
realization that maybe the food he was eating was causing his ill health. Rey
suffered from food related illness for years. He was handicapped by the
sickness; fevers, chills, excruciating stomach pain since he was a child. Rey
was willing to try anything to change his circumstances. In 1994, Rey made the
decision to change to a plant based diet. Rey immediately experienced improved
health and quality of life that he continues to enjoy to this day.</span></b></p>

he built the bakery from the ground up. The Sun Flour Baking vegan cookies quickly
made it onto the shelves in stores, airlines and high-end hotels. He sold
millions of cookies over the years. Rey takes pride in providing healthy food

every six months.  With every $75,000-100,000 we can open up one location.</span></b></p>

Thank you for reading this in advance!!  Garden to
Grill is a celebration of prepared plant-based foods. We create
eclectic, full-flavored Cuisine using local ingredients as much as possible.   Most of our menu items are made from scratch in our kitchen using our
own vegan recipes including our non-dairy cheese, mayonnaise, sauces, veggie
burgers and more, with a multitude of gluten-free options. 
 
Our dedication
to Service is carried even further because the Garden to Grill plant-based menu
also serves the planet.  We are committed to ecologically sound,
sustainable, and the best practices in the restaurant industry
guidelines.  We model how to treat Our Guests and Our Earth through
serving food that is not only delicious and healthy, but reduces environmental
impact and creates a positive net-effect on the planet: We use compostable and
recyclable food containers to reduce our energy use and cut our food waste to
the minimum.
 
Our dedication
and commitment to a plant-based, restaurant alleviates needless negative impact
to animals and the environment. The Garden to Grill commitment is practical and
makes a real difference compared to that of a similar, traditional-style
restaurant.  In the last 12 months alone we saved:
 
 •
50+ million gallons of water
 •
8,000 animals
 •
110,000+ pounds of CO2 gasses
 
At Garden to
Grill we take pride in our ability to offer a food experience that benefits our
customer’s health and well-being and the well-being of the planet and the
animals that share this earth.
 
Our philosophy
is summed up as:  Garden to Grill serves a healthy-heart, plant-based diet
optimal for overall wellbeing with a variety of quick savory meal options for
your fast paced life.
 
 
 About Rey:
 Rey grew up
eating a traditional, Mexican-American Cuisine consisting of beef, pork, and
dairy. After years of being ill from food-related ingredients, Rey had the
realization that maybe the food he was eating was causing his ill health. Rey
suffered from food related illness for years. He was handicapped by the
sickness; fevers, chills, excruciating stomach pain since he was a child. Rey
was willing to try anything to change his circumstances. In 1994, Rey made the
decision to change to a plant based diet. Rey immediately experienced improved
health and quality of life that he continues to enjoy to this day.
 
Rey Ortega
began his life’s work with Alternative Baking Company that same year. Rey founded and developed ABC from the ground floor and nourished it into a large, wholesale
production. He sought to provide a healthy, vegan alternative to the world.
 
Looking for
bigger and better opportunities, Rey left ABC and immediately opened Sun Flour
Baking. It was 1997 and the orders began pouring in. Once again, from scratch
he built the bakery from the ground up. The Sun Flour Baking vegan cookies quickly
made it onto the shelves in stores, airlines and high-end hotels. He sold
millions of cookies over the years. Rey takes pride in providing healthy food
alternatives to everyone, not just the vegan community. The bakery only grew
bigger and faster.
 
 
Ronald
Russell:
4th Generation
Californian Ron Russell is a chef, restaurateur, author of fiction and
non-fiction, and an artist.
 
In addition to
Garden Grill, Ron is co-partner in Sun Café Organic, which has won more than a
dozen culinary awards including being named 1 of the 10 Best Restaurants in Los
Angeles by Open Table in 2013. Sun Café counts Mila Kunis, Colin Farrell, Anne
Hathaway, John Salley, Serena Williams and many other celebrities as regular
customers.
 
Since his late
teens, Ron has followed a plant-based diet for the animals, for the planet and
for health. From age 11, Ron has worked to be an environmentalist: recycling,
reducing wasteful consumption and the environmental decision to be a vegan.
 
Over the past
3 years, in more than 150 plant-based cooking classes, Ron has developed and
shared 15-minute gourmet healthy recipes with his students.
He has been
featured in the NY Times, NBC News, Los Angeles Times, and InStyle, among other
media.
 
 
Rey and Ron
 One day Rey
gives Ron a call asking him to help him save a vegan/plant based café
in Sacramento, CA. The Sugar Plum Vegan café was going out
of business and they saw an opportunity to save it. The previous owner was in
severe debt, losing money and unable to keep the business afloat. She was desperate
to keep the café open to the public, even if she wouldn’t be running it
herself. They kept the doors open and changed the name to The Plum Cafe. They
held a grand re-opening and packed the place inside and out. Over the next two
and a half years, Rey and Ron poured money, sweat and tears into The Plum Café.
They embarked on a long process of remodeling the cafe, upgrading equipment,
building a new team of employees and expanding and perfecting the menu and now
are slightly profitable.
 
Presently, The
Plum Café & Bakery nurtures the veg community with mixers
and special events. We service the gluten free community with our menu items
and our pastries. We bring in people who would have never considered a
plant-based diet and offer nutritious and delicious food that satisfies even
the meat eater. We employ 24 people and offer lifetime employment.
 
We offer
in-house, fresh made foods. We source local fresh bread daily. We make all of
our own pastries, sauces and cheese.
 
 
The Goal
We are
changing our name to Garden to Grill to more accurately reflect our farm to
table sensibilities. In addition, we plan to open additional locations to
spread our healthy and environmentally sound plant-based comfort food. Our goal
is to open a second location in the greater Sacramento area. We want to reach
those anxious for our food and cannot get to our midtown location.
 
When we open
our second location, we can touch more lives with nutritious loving
foods.  We have already saved water, animals and alleviated damage to the
environment. Imagine what we could do with multiple locations! 
 
Ultimately we
would like to open up to 15-20 locations in California. Learning from
successful plant-based restaurant models such as Veggie Grill and Native Foods,
we believe our concept will take plant-based foods to a new level.  This
new location is a jumpstart will start our momentum to opening a new store
every six months.  With every $75,000-100,000 we can open up one location.
 
 
 The Predicament
 The Plum Café
has a wide customer base and a high level of foot traffic. We have found
stability yet we are held back by our facilities and limited space. Our
building is approximately a hundred years old and this creates
challenges.  The rent is high, the repairs and maintenance are high and we
spend much of our time, energy and resources trying to keep up with the
building. With most of our money going back into The Plum Café,
we do not have the start up capitol at this time. 
 
 
Where will the money be invested?Our primary
need is for remodeling, employees, and equipment: ovens, furniture, register
systems, signs, and materials to name just a few. We buy recycled equipment
whenever possible to save money and the environment.
 
 
Risks and
Challenges
 We appreciate
the risk associated by opening up a new location.  However, both Ron and
Rey have had great success starting up businesses from the ground up. They have
4 start ups between them. Rey has over 20 years of experience in food business.
Ron has 5 years running a top restaurant in Los Angeles.
 
In order to
ensure high foot traffic, we will embark on a rigorous marketing campaign,
including commercials, advertisements, flyers, specials and coupons. Our new
location will employ a smaller staff by using a specialized menu of exceptional
items built around a smaller staff and reducing risk. This will ensure on going
success.
 
We aspire to
build a network of Garden to Grills that are as accessible as Chipotle. We will
provide lovingly prepared, plant-based foods that exceed customer expectations
and prepared with exceptional care and speed. Opening a new location is the
next step in our journey. Please join us in making the world a healthier, less polluted

<h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">What is Wincon?  </span><br/>
</h3> <p>Since 2006, Wincon has defined itself as a 'by-the-fans, for-the-fans operation.' The entire event is free of any official personnel or celebrities of any kind. Wincon strives to be a safer space for fans of all races, gender identities, orientations, and abilities. </p>
<p>Wincon’s ongoing mission is to bring together a diverse group of internet-based media fans in an inclusive environment to engage in fannish activities and foster meaningful connections. We provide programming created and led by attendees, on topics drawn from a variety of sources and involving everything from detailed meta to wildly creative fanworks, encompassing all aspects of fandom culture. </p>
<p>As that fandom culture grows and evolves, so must Wincon. This campaign will allow us to expand our programming and activities and to increase our attendee cap to 300 people in 2015 (and beyond)! </p>
<p>Your support means that an event that has been a fandom cornerstone for hundreds of fans since 2006 gets to live on. It means new fans will get the chance to attend Wincon and experience the irreplaceable feeling of being in a room where everyone understands and embraces fan culture; where we can talk about every aspect of fannishness without fear of judgement; and where we get to celebrate our community, its rich history, and its ever evolving future surrounded by people who genuinely love fandom!</p>
<h3><b>Programming at Wincon</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><span>All of Wincon's multi-fandom programming is designed and staffed by volunteers, both attendees and members of our con committee. All our programming is suggested, voted on, and led by con attendees. This ensures that the content at Wincon is what the fans want to talk about, see, and do. We have large panels, small round table discussions, workshops, and several special events.</span></p>
<p>Our programming includes both fandom-specific fare (horror TV! comics! Elementary!) and multi-fandom topics (podfic! kink! diversity in fandom! femslash!) We cover a vast array of fandoms each year, and even if your fandom isn't represented with a panel of its own, you'll probably find someone else who loves it just as much as you do. You can also sign up for our Pimp Your Fandom panel and convince everyone to join you! Workshops give our attendees a chance to learn something new or improve your skills. Past workshops have included live beta reading, art tips and tricks, knitting 101, and making fannish plushies.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1030598/files/20141119164217-diversitypanel.jpg?1416444137"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In addition to panels and workshops, we have amazing group events. Our Meet &amp; Greet on Thursday allows everyone to mingle, hang out, play games, and get to know some new people before the weekend begins. Friday night brings our yearly Vid Show, highlighting premiering vids and old favorites to the fans in attendance. Our Bad Fic Idol competition is an exercise in just how ridiculous you can be in 400 words or less. Don’t forget to close out your Saturday at Winprom, where you’re free to come in your finest duds, your t-shirt and jeans, or your spiffiest costume.</p>
<p>Although not an official part of con proceedings, our committee also organizes activities in our host cities, including ghost tours and trips to popular local attractions for those who want to include some sightseeing in their con weekend.  </p> </div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>At 300 attendees, the event itself will cost, at minimum, $18,000. We are setting our campaign goal at $15,000 to guarantee that we can meet this minimum and hold a successful event in October 2015. We are offering several registration and non-registration perks that will enable us to raise the needed amount in order to move forward with the event while still allowing us to keep registration open after the close of the Indiegogo Campaign. Registrations we sell after the close of the campaign will meet the remaining need (about 50-75 more registrations).</p>
<p>What does that $18,000 cover? Based off of the projection of 300 attendees:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hotel Space - $9600</li>
<li>Attendee Swag (Bag, Tumbler, Pen, Notebook, Keychain, &amp; more)- $3000</li>
<li>Programming Supplies (Workshops, Crafting, Games, etc.)- $1200</li>
<li>Registration Supplies (program books, lanyards, badges, badge holders, wristbands, buttons, etc.) - $500</li>
<li>Audio/Visual Rental - $500</li>
<li>Transportation of Inventory &amp; Supplies - $700</li>
<li>IGG Perks (Shipping + Production) - $1500</li>
<li>Misc. Fees (Insurance, Banking, Paypal, Indiegogo, Website, etc.) - $1000</li>
</ul>
<p>What will we do with any extra money we take in? Well keep in mind, the above costs are the MINIMUM. As we take in more money, we'll be able to offer more to our attendees in terms of activities, food and beverage, etc. without raising the cost of attendance. We'll also be able to make some longterm investments in Wincon's future by purchasing Audio/Visual equipment (therefore avoiding rental fees in the future), as well as a laser printer for registration, cutting down on printing costs. </p><p> </p>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>We have some awesome perks to thank you for helping to keep Wincon alive. Of course, we are offering weekend registrations. You can purchase your weekend ticket for $55 or choose from several add-on options. </p>
<p>Five amazing artists have contributed their talent and created custom Wincon Heroes art, inspired by the awesomeness of Wincon itself. You can get the Heroes on buttons, post cards, a poster, or all three! </p><p> </p>

What is Wincon?  
 Since 2006, Wincon has defined itself as a 'by-the-fans, for-the-fans operation.' The entire event is free of any official personnel or celebrities of any kind. Wincon strives to be a safer space for fans of all races, gender identities, orientations, and abilities. 
Wincon’s ongoing mission is to bring together a diverse group of internet-based media fans in an inclusive environment to engage in fannish activities and foster meaningful connections. We provide programming created and led by attendees, on topics drawn from a variety of sources and involving everything from detailed meta to wildly creative fanworks, encompassing all aspects of fandom culture. 
As that fandom culture grows and evolves, so must Wincon. This campaign will allow us to expand our programming and activities and to increase our attendee cap to 300 people in 2015 (and beyond)! 
Your support means that an event that has been a fandom cornerstone for hundreds of fans since 2006 gets to live on. It means new fans will get the chance to attend Wincon and experience the irreplaceable feeling of being in a room where everyone understands and embraces fan culture; where we can talk about every aspect of fannishness without fear of judgement; and where we get to celebrate our community, its rich history, and its ever evolving future surrounded by people who genuinely love fandom!
Programming at Wincon

All of Wincon's multi-fandom programming is designed and staffed by volunteers, both attendees and members of our con committee. All our programming is suggested, voted on, and led by con attendees. This ensures that the content at Wincon is what the fans want to talk about, see, and do. We have large panels, small round table discussions, workshops, and several special events.
Our programming includes both fandom-specific fare (horror TV! comics! Elementary!) and multi-fandom topics (podfic! kink! diversity in fandom! femslash!) We cover a vast array of fandoms each year, and even if your fandom isn't represented with a panel of its own, you'll probably find someone else who loves it just as much as you do. You can also sign up for our Pimp Your Fandom panel and convince everyone to join you! Workshops give our attendees a chance to learn something new or improve your skills. Past workshops have included live beta reading, art tips and tricks, knitting 101, and making fannish plushies.


In addition to panels and workshops, we have amazing group events. Our Meet & Greet on Thursday allows everyone to mingle, hang out, play games, and get to know some new people before the weekend begins. Friday night brings our yearly Vid Show, highlighting premiering vids and old favorites to the fans in attendance. Our Bad Fic Idol competition is an exercise in just how ridiculous you can be in 400 words or less. Don’t forget to close out your Saturday at Winprom, where you’re free to come in your finest duds, your t-shirt and jeans, or your spiffiest costume.
Although not an official part of con proceedings, our committee also organizes activities in our host cities, including ghost tours and trips to popular local attractions for those who want to include some sightseeing in their con weekend.   
What We Need
At 300 attendees, the event itself will cost, at minimum, $18,000. We are setting our campaign goal at $15,000 to guarantee that we can meet this minimum and hold a successful event in October 2015. We are offering several registration and non-registration perks that will enable us to raise the needed amount in order to move forward with the event while still allowing us to keep registration open after the close of the Indiegogo Campaign. Registrations we sell after the close of the campaign will meet the remaining need (about 50-75 more registrations).
What does that $18,000 cover? Based off of the projection of 300 attendees:

Hotel Space - $9600
Attendee Swag (Bag, Tumbler, Pen, Notebook, Keychain, & more)- $3000
Programming Supplies (Workshops, Crafting, Games, etc.)- $1200
Registration Supplies (program books, lanyards, badges, badge holders, wristbands, buttons, etc.) - $500
Audio/Visual Rental - $500
Transportation of Inventory & Supplies - $700
IGG Perks (Shipping + Production) - $1500
Misc. Fees (Insurance, Banking, Paypal, Indiegogo, Website, etc.) - $1000

What will we do with any extra money we take in? Well keep in mind, the above costs are the MINIMUM. As we take in more money, we'll be able to offer more to our attendees in terms of activities, food and beverage, etc. without raising the cost of attendance. We'll also be able to make some longterm investments in Wincon's future by purchasing Audio/Visual equipment (therefore avoiding rental fees in the future), as well as a laser printer for registration, cutting down on printing costs.  
The Perks
We have some awesome perks to thank you for helping to keep Wincon alive. Of course, we are offering weekend registrations. You can purchase your weekend ticket for $55 or choose from several add-on options. 
Five amazing artists have contributed their talent and created custom Wincon Heroes art, inspired by the awesomeness of Wincon itself. You can get the Heroes on buttons, post cards, a poster, or all three!  


 
We also have some one of a kind perks from fan artists and creators. These include artist commissions, never before seen photos, jewelry, and more. Indiegogo limits the number of perks we can list at one time, so we will be rolling out some of these later in the campaign. Keep checking back!  Additionally, Indiegogo only gives us 500 characters for perk descriptions. Please leave a comment or send us a message if you have questions or need more details about any of our perks.  



   
    



Please note: If you purchase a perk that includes registration, we will send you an email after the close of the campaign with details on how to complete the registration process. 
If you would like to register, but can't pay the full amount, you can pay what you are able. Just select no perk and we will email you after the close of the campaign to verify that you want that amount put towards a registration. 
If you love Wincon as much as we do and want to see it continue, please purchase your registration now or choose one of our other awesome perks!
